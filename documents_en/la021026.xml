<HD>Bone Thugs--N-Harmony turn cliches into riches</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gangsta cliches don't ever die -- they multiply. And that's true for
many of the words of Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, accented with the usual
sounds of gunfire and tough talk on the thug life. But the Cleveland
rappers have always risen far above the crowd with a rich musical
sensibility that matches hard-core rhymes with street-corner
harmonies.</LD>
<LD>   That musical sophistication was on display at the group's concert
Wednesday at the House of Blues, where Bone Thugs performed a show
heavy with tunes from the new album, "Thug World Order," out next
week. The sound on stage was as crisp and sophisticated as the album,
with sweet, lush melodies that owed as much to an animated vocal
style as to astute sampling in the studio.</LD>
<LD>   Bone Thugs were early explorers of the same territory that their
contemporaries in OutKast have ridden to platinum sales and critical
acclaim. Drawing as deeply on classic soul as on hard-core rap, the
musical choices never sound unnatural or forced, even when sampling
the light '80s pop of Phil Collins.</LD>
<TE>   Amid the odes to weed and their hometown, the rappers also
name-dropped the late Ruthless Records impresario and N.W.A member
Eazy-E, who briefly appears posthumously on the new album. Eazy can
be heard claiming, "Killings, robbery, murder, thievin' ...
everything you hear on our records is true."</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the night, the core group was performing "Money,
Money" ("I don't want to be broke no more!") while sharing the House
of Blues stage with more than 25 supporters standing behind them, not
doing much of anything, as Bone Thugs turned cliches into music.</TE>

<HD>Celebrity trials: Juicy distraction in serious times</HD>
<DH>Winona Ryder's case, not our most weighty current event,
still feeds the public's interest in the lives and troubles of the
rich and famous.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mimi Avins</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As October drifts toward the delights of Halloween, baseball fans can
focus on the World Series. Celebrity-watchers have the Winona Ryder
trial. They can't count on a regular season of play, but such trials
are a major spectator sport nonetheless.</LD>
<LD>   Press interest in the Ryder case was so feverish in its early
stages that the defendant's right elbow was fractured outside a
hearing on June 3, when a cameraman accidentally bopped her with his
video gear. L.A. County Superior Court received requests for
courtroom seats from 31 media outlets, including a German news agency
and the BBC.</LD>
<LD>   Angels fans follow deconstructions of the sniper hunt and still
root for their team. Curiosity about a celebrity in trouble may be
diminished right now, but everyone needs a little distraction, which
is what celebrity trials provide. In the year of O.J., no one in L.A.
was strapped for conversation. The Simpson trial was a reliable
topic, about which everyone had an opinion. It might have been a "Who
cares," the feeling that too much attention was paid. Yet celebrity
trials have become so much a part of our public discourse that
they've taken on a Zen aspect: To not have a position on them is to
have a position.</LD>
<TE>   They are as polarizing as ketchup on cottage cheese. Henry
Schleiff, chairman and chief executive of Court TV, says, "Each trial
is a small soap opera. Our viewers either love the plaintiff or love
their lawyers or hate the defendant or the defendant's lawyers.
People feel passionate, one way or the other."</TE>
<TE>   Does a celebrity get a better or worse day in court than an
anonymous defendant? The consensus among experienced trial watchers
is that Ryder, facing three felony counts, has been overcharged. Dan
Abrams, NBC's chief legal correspondent and host of "The Abrams
Report" on MSNBC, has, for the last 10 years, covered every major
celebrity trial. "The prosecutors sometimes do come down harder on
celebrities," he says. "They deny it, but they do. There is no
question that Winona Ryder is being treated more harshly than an
everyday [alleged] shoplifter. I'm surprised the case hasn't pled
out, and that it's being treated as a felony. Prosecutors try to send
a message to the community with high-profile cases. They want that
person standing in the department store considering whether to stick
a sweater under their shirt to think: If even Winona Ryder was
treated so seriously, what would happen to me?"</TE>
<TE>   Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles district
attorney's office, says, "This case has been handled like any other
case of its type."</TE>
<TE>   Whether justice is served depends on juries as well as
prosecutors. For good or ill, juries share history with celebrities.
Over time, they come to believe they know things about people they've
never met. Tom Hanks is a nice guy. Elizabeth Hurley is a diva. Such
judgments might be based on reports of off-camera behavior. More
often, an image results from the successful presentation of a
carefully crafted persona, or the confusion of a role with the person
paid to play it.</TE>
<TE>   "Depending on who they are, celebrities will often get a
presumption of innocence that defendant X, Y or Z doesn't get,"
Abrams says. "Jurors don't want to believe that a celebrity they like
committed a crime. If a celebrity has a bad reputation, that can hurt
them with juries too."</TE>
<TE>   Only in Los Angeles can celebrities really get juries of their
peers. Producer Peter Guber was in the courthouse Thursday on jury
duty and was called as part of the Ryder panel. Wearing a Mandalay
Pictures polo shirt and denim carpenter pants, he said to a packed
elevator, "I have about as much chance of getting on this jury as the
man in the moon. I only made three pictures with the lady."</TE>
<TE>   Celebrity trials can create their own celebrities, who become
heroes or villains. (Either can get book contracts and wind up with
their own talk shows.) Linda Deutsch, the dean of trial reporters and
the legal affairs correspondent for Associated Press, says, "The
prosecutor in the Manson trial capitalized on it. The Sam Sheppard
trial set the stage for F. Lee Bailey's career. Jury consultants have
made their mark more recently. The talking heads, experts and
commentators were all a product of the O.J. Simpson case."</TE>
<TE>   When Ryder appeared in court this week, the proceedings weren't
much more compelling than watching corn flakes get soggy. On
Thursday, about 50 members of the media were exiled to the hallway
outside the courtroom. Late in the afternoon, reporters were allowed
in, and they listened to Judge Elden Fox's instructions to
prospective jurors. Yet the digest of events presented that evening
on Entertainment Tonight/Access Hollywood/E! News Daily, etc.,
acquired a slickly packaged gloss. Audiences used to fast-paced
episodes of "Law &amp; Order" expect no less. "Fictional courtroom dramas
are a highlights reel of a process that is slow and complex,"
Schleiff says. "The wheels of justice move slowly. Reality doesn't
take place in 30 minutes."</TE>
<TE>   The star of the latest real courtroom drama, doe-eyed and
waif-like, fits no one's idea of a public enemy. She even starred in
"The Age of Innocence," playing, incidentally, an ingenue as dumb as
a fox. The fact that she had prescription painkillers in her purse
when she sashayed around Saks in Beverly Hills probably helped her
case. Fans would rather see her as stoned, or confused by
debilitating pain than soberly in the wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Accusing Ryder of shoplifting is akin to busting Hugh Grant for
employing a hooker. It's wicked fun to talk about these cases in
which no one was killed, no great tragedy occurred. Both incidents
are embarrassing and titillating, but the future of the republic
hardly rests on their prosecution. Sure, sure, "shrinkage," the
retail industry's euphemism for theft, is a big problem that
law-abiding consumers ultimately pay for. But in an overtaxed
criminal justice system, the question of how resources should be
allocated looms. It costs $9,459 a day to run a criminal trial,
according to a Superior Court spokesperson.</TE>
<TE>   It is possible to see cases that fall into the category of Zsa Zsa
Gabor's cop-slapping trial as ultimately pretty harmless, in part
because fans and especially Hollywood have historically been
forgiving. Director Roman Polanski, who fled the U.S. after pleading
guilty to one count of having sex with a minor, became neither a
personal nor a professional pariah. Robert Downey Jr. received enough
votes from his peers for an Emmy nomination after repeated arrests
for possessing drugs. Tolerance for overweight and aging can be
harder to come by, but celebrities have redeemed themselves from
almost everything short of cannibalism.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, we don't know if Winona is guilty," says KTLA Morning
News producer Marcia Brandwynne, "but people are interested in cases
like hers because they wonder about what would make a person so
unhappy that they would behave self-destructively, when they seem to
have riches and fame, everything most Americans dream about. Those
questions won't be answered till she goes on Barbara Walters."</TE>
<TE>   Gossip is our universal language, the mother tongue. What better
to yak about than the foibles of the stars? Celebrity courtroom
dramas are a preferred amusement in an era when schadenfreude, an
obscure German term describing the pleasure derived from the
misfortunes of others, has found a place in the American lexicon.
Proof that the mighty have, if not fallen, then at least slipped, is
both an antidote to and a byproduct of envy. The stars we sometimes
worship are beautiful, wealthy, famous and talented, but they aren't
happy, are they? What a satisfying thought. Or at least it used to
be.</TE>
<TE>   Humorist Christopher Buckley's new comic novel, "No Way to Treat a
First Lady," (Random House, 2002) concerns the Trial of the
Millennium, wherein the first lady is accused of murdering the
philanderer in chief by beaning him with a silver Paul Revere
spittoon. Buckley admits to having been completely caught up in the
Simpson trial. "Anything that tells us about our national psyche, as
these trials do, is ripe for satire," he says. "These things become
absurdist pageants, where all our venalities are on display. I don't
know if Winona Ryder is a nice person or not, but I feel sorry for
her. I can't even work up any enthusiasm about enjoying the Martha
Stewart spectacle. I'm not suggesting we start a prayer vigil or
light candles for them, but I'm losing a bit of the old piss and
vinegar. I'm not enjoying their pain."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the day, all these trials are rather sad. Someone
got hurt or a reputation is wounded. The chestnut that no publicity
is bad just isn't true. Anyone would want to be remembered for her
good work, not for personal screw-ups. How many of those dishing
Ryder bought tickets to her last few movies? The irony is that if she
had a dollar for every person gossiping about her legal troubles, she
could, well, go shopping.</TE>

<LD>   Ryder, Reubens and Gabor are but three in a long line of
celebrities who've had run-ins with the law. A sampling from the
police blotter, Hollywood-style, highlights nine names.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Sean "P. Diddy" Combs</TE>
<TE>   How dapper he looked each day in a New York courtroom last year as
he faced trial on charges of weapon possession and attempted bribery.
His girlfriend might have dumped him, but man, he looked good enough
to be a billboard for a men's clothing company. A men's clothing
company? What a great idea.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kim Delaney</TE>
<TE>   The former star of "NYPD Blue" and a star on the new "CSI: Miami,"
pleaded no contest in February to a charge of reckless driving after
a motorist who thought she was driving erratically followed her home
and alerted the cops. She refused to take a sobriety test, police
said. Watch out for guys who follow you home.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Robert Downey Jr.</TE>
<TE>   We can't keep track anymore. Some of the highlights: He spent a
year in Corcoran State Prison. He scared some Malibu neighbors when
he unsoberly stumbled into their home and passed out in their bed.
And he messed up Ally McBeal's love life when he left the series,
possibly leading to the series' demise.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Zsa Zsa Gabor</TE>
<TE>   The grandmammy of contemporary celebrity criminals, Gabor famously
slapped a handsome Beverly Hills motorcycle cop after he stopped her
for a traffic violation in 1989. She was sentenced to three days in
jail. The episode provided the then-72-year-old actress with the most
publicity she'd gotten in years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hugh Grant</TE>
<TE>   He's so cute, he can get away with anything. Well, almost. In
1995, Grant pleaded no contest to a charge of lewd conduct with a
prostitute and got two years' probation. Then-girlfriend Elizabeth
Hurley publicly forgave him. "Tonight Show" host Jay Leno welcomed
him with: "What the hell were you thinking?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pee-wee Herman</TE>
<TE>   Paul Reubens is the one-time star of "Pee-wee's Playhouse," a
children's show and adult cult favorite. In 1991, he pleaded no
contest to a misdemeanor charge of indecent exposure. His real crime?
Spawning a million bad imitations of his hilarious bar-top dance to
"Tequila" in "Pee-wee's Big Adventure."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tawny Kitaen</TE>
<TE>   The former music video vixen agreed last month to a plea bargain
on spousal abuse and battery charges. Although she did not admit
guilt, Kitaen agreed to enter a spousal-battery counseling program,
which could lead to the charges being dropped. Her husband, Chuck
Finley, pitches for the St. Louis Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nick Nolte</TE>
<TE>   The raggedy actor is to be arraigned next week on a misdemeanor
charge of driving under the influence of what prosecutors say was the
date rape drug GHB. Cops arrested him on Pacific Coast Highway in
Malibu last month after seeing his Mercedes swerve in lanes. They say
he was drooling behind the wheel. Eeew.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Winona Ryder</TE>
<TE>   The waifish actress who starred in "Beetlejuice" and "Girl,
Interrupted" is on trial now in Beverly Hills. Her elbow was broken
in a media crush. Her mother told US magazine the experience has been
a nightmare. We can only imagine. Did she steal those rags from Saks
Fifth Avenue? Stay tuned.</TE>

<LD>The ascendancy of Johnny Knoxville and the rest of MTV's "Jackass"
gang to the big screen shouldn't come as all that surprising,
especially given the original show's popularity and the synergistic
ethos of the cable network's parent company, Paramount, which is
releasing the feature-length film based on the series. Then, too,
since Jim Carrey seems to have relinquished his party tricks to
become an annual Academy Award hopeful and since uber-moron Adam
Sandler has been elevated to art-house legitimacy in the critical
favorite "Punch-Drunk Love," somebody had to assume the mantle of the
nation's stupidest non-elected white guys. Hence, "Jackass the
Movie," a feature-length endeavor that's every bit as disreputable
and often as embarrassingly funny as the MTV program, only longer.</LD>
<TE>   A string of pranks and gags, the movie follows the same premise as
the show: ringleader Knoxville and his shock jocks -- Bam Margera,
Chris Pontius, Steve-O, Dave England, Ryan Dunn, Jason "Wee Man"
Acuna, Preston Lacy and Ehren McGhehey -- run around executing very
stupid, at times hazardous, human tricks. On the show, the stunts
have involved Tasers, pepper spray, a live goldfish (which was
swallowed and regurgitated), attack dogs and enough excremental
waggery and penis jokes to provoke curiosity about the group's
collective arrested growth, especially in what Freud called the anal
and oral stages of development. For the most part, the stunts are
overwhelmingly idiotic, although they occasionally do approach the
great prankster tradition of upending everyday norms, as in the
"Bloody Windshield" episode, in which the crew brought a bloodied
automobile to a car wash, where it was promptly cleaned.</TE>
<TE>   In the movie, the escapades range from the inspired ("Rent-a-Car
Crash Derby") to the silly (the Jackasses, including producer Spike
Jonze, run amok while prosthetically made up to look like elderly
men) to the disgusting (a Jackass tries out, literally, a display
toilet in a store selling bathroom fixtures). When the comedy works,
as in the rental-car crash interlude, it's because the stunt taps
into the rage, and the attendant sense of helplessness and
frustration, that bubbles under the surface of so many of our
ordinary exchanges.</TE>
<TE>   In the derby episode, Knoxville politely listens to the rental-car
agent as the man carefully drones on about the car's existing dings,
then takes the car to be outfitted for an intentional pile-up. What
makes the stunt funny isn't the sight of the car getting smashed (or
the blowup dolls parked in the back seat), but the gleeful sense of
liberation. Here, finally, is one guy who's managed to escape the
authoritarian bonds of the car-rental contract.</TE>
<TE>   Upending our consensual reality is at the heart of the greatest
pranks, whether the trickster is Marcel Duchamp or performance artist
Joe Coleman, who in 1980 showed up at a 10-year high school reunion
claiming to be someone who had died five years earlier, then set off
explosives strapped to his chest. (He lived.)</TE>
<TE>   In the years since, outrage has become the fulcrum of mainstream
commercial culture, fodder for stuff like the BattleBots and
reality-based shows such as "Fear Factor." On "Fear Factor,"
contestants are covered with live worms; in "Jackass the Movie," a
guy hangs from a tightrope above some alligators with a raw chicken
hanging out of his underwear. Funny, yes, but no one here is pushing
the edge of the envelope, either aesthetically or politically, the
way Abbie Hoffman did when he was arrested in the late 1960s for
trying to elevate the Pentagon in order to exorcise its demons.</TE>
<TE>   In comparison, the "Jackass" guys come off as incredibly tame: At
their best, they're closer to the Three Stooges; at their most banal,
they're as original as the Red Hot Chili Peppers performing nude with
socks on their penises. Can a collection of goofy antics shot in
crummy-looking digital video and haphazardly strung together be
called a movie? If it's projected onto movie screens in movie
theaters and comes with the imprimatur of a big movie studio, there's
no reason it shouldn't, especially given the quality of the other
brainless stuff out there. It's a hoot, but it's unclear why anyone
would shell out money to watch a bunch of guys run around in their
underwear puking up their guts and, in one explicitly visible
instance, soiling their underwear.</TE>

<HD>Silence is golden in 'Gioconda'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Writer-director Randy Schulman breaks theatrical ground in "La
Gioconda," his frequently brilliant world-premiere piece at Stages
Theater Center.</LD>
<LD>   Set in Italy -- and later France -- in 1911, "La Gioconda" is
essentially a staged silent movie, starring Schulman and his wife,
Delcie Adams. Schulman plays Vincenzo Bocca, a woebegone Little Tramp
type who adores the winsome Francesca (Adams). Francesca loves
Vincenzo, but her father, General Giovanni (Kate McLaughlin), has
promised her to one of his officers, (the crisply villainous Kevin
Gregg), a womanizer and a cad.</LD>
<LD>   On Francesca's wedding day, General Giovanni jokingly comments (on
a title card, of course; no words are ever spoken) that the day
Vincenzo steals the Mona Lisa and brings it back to Italy is the day
he can have Francesca. At which point, the action devolves into an
increasingly surreal caper, with a chase through the sewers of Paris
and intrusive appearances by famous horror-film characters. Full
masks obscure the expressive faces of many in the cast, and the
emotional thrust of Schulman's scenario dribbles away into bizarre
side plots.</LD>
<TE>   That's a shame, because the first act and parts of the second are
otherwise exquisitely realized. Schulman's occasional segues into the
surreal and the deliberately anachronistic only enhance the story.
It's when the surreal spins into silliness that he disappoints.</TE>
<TE>   Schulman's wonderfully innovative style makes up for his story's
shortcomings. An inspired physical comedian, Schulman takes pride of
place in this large and talented company. Adams, a Mary
Pickford-petite gamin with soulful eyes, is also perfectly cast. In
Schulman's stringent staging, the actors comport themselves with the
grace and exactitude of trained mimes, while a huge and proficient
design team ensures just the right look for this vintage
black-and-white "film." Adams, Nino Ameri and Nani Stone contribute
wonderful costumes, with the white faces and black lips of Buddy
Head's makeup design adding greatly to the period look.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly effective is the sound design by Schulman and DE3 of
Polyrhythmic, a blend of vintage tunes, Fellini-esque musical scores
and modern-day techno.</TE>

<HD>A Latin taste</HD>
<DH>Uncorking a scene at its first Latin American awards, MTV
and the music are big winners.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Agustin Gurza</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MIAMI BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The Rolling Stones sent a good-natured greeting in Spanish with
British accents. Shakira played guitar and belted out a scorcher
without ever swiveling her hips. Hometown favorites Gloria and Emilio
Estefan were nowhere in sight.</LD>
<LD>   The inaugural MTV Video Music Awards Latin America, held here
Thursday night at the Jackie Gleason Theater and broadcast live
throughout most of the Western Hemisphere, lived up to its billing as
a showcase for the unconventional. It was a night of surprises, of
unexpected collaborations, of sheer celebration for a new wave of
music that has captured the imagination of young people from Tijuana
to Buenos Aires.</LD>
<LD>   The winners almost seemed secondary. Their trophies looked less
than glorious -- a thick, pink tongue. The main point of the ceremony
was to declare that alternative music had come of age in Latin
America and had earned the MTV imprimatur as the hip choice of
today's Spanish-speaking youth. The move represents a resounding vote
of confidence in a market that is often ignored in the United States
or dismissed as a minority phenomenon. For some, the recognition was
a long time coming.</LD>
<TE>   Pioneering rock en espanol producer Gustavo Santaolalla shared the
night's ebullient mood, greeting artists as they left the Art Deco
theater in trendy South Beach. He had worked, often with scant
commercial success, to shepherd the careers of many musicians in
attendance, including Colombia's Juanes, who won for best male
artist.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, it's spectacular to see all this, because I had this
vision 30 years ago," said the Argentine-born producer, now based in
Los Angeles. "I always had imagined this moment would come, and it
seems so positive that finally, after so many years, we have a
celebration like this one."</TE>
<TE>   Though the awards are new, MTV in Latin America is not. The music
network entered the market nine years ago and has grown right along
with the music. It now reaches 12 million households through
programming tailored for three regions -- Mexico and the Caribbean in
the north, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay in the southeast, and
Chile, Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador in the southwest.</TE>
<TE>   This is MTV's 11th awards show, said Antoinette Zel, president of
MTV Networks Latin America, headquartered in Miami. But it's the
first to air on the network worldwide in a language other than
English. Eventually, organizers estimate, the show will reach 410
million households and more than 1 billion potential viewers as it
airs on MTV's global network and through independent broadcasters,
such as Mexico's Televisa.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an understanding by all MTVs around the world that this
audience, 12 to 24, is very adventurous and very risk-taking in
music," Zel said Thursday before the show. "We have such a close
relationship with them. We know that just by introducing good music,
language aside, it will connect."</TE>
<TE>   Why now? The time is right, Zel said. There are more and better
videos, and more and more artists gaining popularity outside their
geographic regions.</TE>
<TE>   MTV's audience is by nature elite, network executives concede. It
represents affluent fans who can afford satellite or cable and who
have access to computers to vote for their favorite nominees on MTV's
Web site. In Mexico, for example, cable reaches just 14% of TV
households, Zel said. The awards show, however, will reach a much
wider audience worldwide. It was carried live by MTV2 in the U.S.,
with a delayed feed to add English subtitles. In the press room
backstage, reporters could see both versions almost side by side,
highlighting the impressively quick and accurate translations.</TE>
<TE>   There's no mistaking this show for the Latin Grammy Awards,
launched three years ago at the height of the so-called Latin music
boom in the U.S. For one, the MTV Latin awards don't try to encompass
all genres or aspire to reach the mainstream U.S. audience. And the
Latin Grammys, broadcast nationally in prime time, could never use
the sexual, soft-porn graphics used by MTV as a play on its tongue
trophy.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, the MTV Latin America channels can't even be seen in
the U.S. The MTV cable outlet here, called MTV Espanol, features a
different set of artists, primarily those whose records are available
in the U.S. and who may have much lower profiles in the southern
continent.</TE>
<TE>   "Latin America is a totally different world than the U.S. Hispanic
market," said Jose Santillan, Latin American vice president of music
and artist relations. "We may live here but we don't really see Latin
American culture as it is in Latin America."</TE>
<TE>   Even die-hard Latin music aficionados would be hard-pressed to
identify all the MTV nominees in categories devoted to each region.
But understanding regional preferences has been the key to the
network's success, executives said.</TE>
<TE>   Zel summed up the strategy in one word: "legitimacy." "It's an MTV
that's their own; it's not a U.S.-driven MTV," the Cuban American
executive said. "We go to great lengths to make sure that it's really
organic, that it comes from there."</TE>
<TE>   MTV claims some credit in developing the cross-border appeal of
Latin alternative artists, exposing them to fans in 22 countries. The
prime example today is Shakira, who began her career as a preteen in
her native Barranquilla, Colombia, before gaining wider popularity in
the mid-'90s among fans across the continent.</TE>
<TE>   "I practically grew up with MTV Latin," said Shakira, the night's
big winner, in her dressing room before rehearsal. "It's nice to see
them at this point, so solid as a channel. But it's not just a
channel -- it's a common space for young people, and they need it."</TE>
<TE>   Juanes certainly needed MTV. His first solo album, "Fijate Bien,"
was acclaimed by critics but got little airplay. It was MTV that
exposed the provocative young artist to fans outside Colombia, long
before he made an international splash with seven nominations in last
year's Latin Grammy awards.</TE>
<TE>   "Juanes is a product of that MTV boutique, which played his music
when radio wouldn't," says Fernan Martinez, his Miami-based manager.
"MTV Latino even recommended him before his album was released."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the recent Latin Grammy show, MTV's event came off as fresh
and power-packed, especially the finale pairing Mexican band Kinky
with pop diva Paulina Rubio. The hosts, Mexican actor Diego Luna ("Y
Tu Mama Tambien") and Argentine TV personality Mario Pergolini,
captured the event's irreverent and casual spirit.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a great vibe tonight, very relaxed," said Colombian
newcomer Andres Cabas, who appeared as a presenter. "Latin America is
on the move with tremendous strength, really. But until now, the
continent has had a kind of cork holding back its creativity. I feel
this is the moment for the music to come uncorked."</TE>

<HD>Fado singer Cristina Branco is deferring many of her
strengths</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cristina Branco is one of the prominent members of the current wave
of young fado singers who have been surfacing over the past decade in
Portugal. Although she, like the others, has found her own way to
connect with the music's rich and varied history, there are some
marked distinctions in the manner in which her art has evolved.</LD>
<LD>   The primary difference -- apparent throughout her program at the
Skirball Cultural Center on Thursday -- was her complete creative
linkage with her husband and principal collaborator, guitarist
Custodio Castelo. Branco sang material primarily composed by Castelo,
framed by his often busy arrangements.</LD>
<LD>   That's not to minimize the strength or the quality of Branco's
singing.</LD>
<TE>   But the undercurrent of the evening was established early, when
Castelo, along with guitarist Alexandre Silva and bassist Miguel
Carvalhinho, started the program with an instrumental number that ran
on far too long to serve as a simple introduction to the program's
star attraction.</TE>
<TE>   Once Branco arrived on stage, however, the partnership aspect of
the music quickly became clear.</TE>
<TE>   Frequently deferring to Castelo, often beginning her songs facing
him rather than her listeners, she seemed less an independent
presence than the visual manifestation of his musical views. One
could only wonder why such an extraordinary talent seems to find it
difficult to reach into the heart of her own creativity.</TE>

<HD>A speech, then inclusive transcendence</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ernesto Lechner</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not too many singers can get away with opening a show with a sobering
speech to the crowd. Ruben Blades did just that on Thursday at the
Mayan Theatre, and his words, at first, weren't exactly auspicious.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm a musician, not a human CD player," he said forcefully,
chastising anyone foolish enough to expect him to launch into one of
his signature salsa hits from the past.</LD>
<LD>   Blades' new album, "Mundo," has precious little to do with the
dance-friendly material that decades ago turned the Panamanian singer
into one of the key figures in Latin music.</LD>
<TE>   "Mundo" explores the common musical heritage that unites many
cultures of the world. A kaleidoscopic blend of Afro-Caribbean,
Celtic, Middle Eastern, Brazilian and African idioms, the album is
richly ambitious. Although some of it lacks the infectious swing of
Blades' more celebrated works, it compensates with its lyricism and
seasoned dexterity.</TE>
<TE>   So, Blades emphasized in his speech at the Mayan, the centerpiece
of the evening was "Mundo" and its pan-cultural message. The old
favorites would be performed later. In other words: If you eat all
your veggies, you can have some dessert.</TE>
<TE>   Blades first showcased some of his collaborators. Costa Rican
new-age group Editus, Brazilian vocal ensemble Boca Livre and Los
Angeles-based Celtic musician Eric Rigler performed a few numbers
that, without Blades' unifying vision, did not rise above sounding
pleasant. The audience clapped politely, if at all.</TE>
<TE>   But then Blades launched into one of "Mundo's" most powerful
tracks: the anthem-like "Primogenio," a bewitching collage of
uilleann pipes, Middle Eastern atmospherics and Cuban guaguanco.
Suddenly, Blades' oh-so-intellectual discourse was animated by a
fleshy, in-your-face sense of immediacy.</TE>
<TE>   Then the singer lifted his stated rules and proceeded to spice up
the three-hour show with dozens of vintage songs. The obligatory
favorites, including "Plastico" and "Pedro Navaja," were peppered
with lesser-known gems such as "Camaleon," "Todos Vuelven," "Cuentas
del Alma" and a rousing version of Willie Colon and Hector Lavoe's
Panamanian-themed oldie "La Murga."</TE>
<TE>   It was an embarrassment of riches, played by a rotating cast of
musicians that at some points numbered 18. The quintessential sonero
(a fierce, improvisation-friendly Afro-Caribbean singer), Blades has
always transcended salsa by fusing the genre's danceability with
lyrics that paint a painfully vivid picture of Latin America's
larger-than-life sensibility.</TE>
<TE>   Interspersed with the vintage hits, the occasional cut from
"Mundo" sounded right at home.</TE>
<TE>   It has taken Blades a while to establish the new sonic identity
that flowers in "Mundo," and in the process he received plenty of
criticism. He was stubborn enough to stick to his vision, proving his
detractors wrong while remaining an essential force in the
impoverished landscape of contemporary Latin music.</TE>

<LD>WHY would The Times feature a story about the likes of Tom Leykis
("The mouth of misogyny," by Bob Baker, Oct. 18)? I suppose if
Hitler, Cromwell or Bin Laden had a talk show, The Times would
promote it, cleverly disguised with a query as to whether their
beliefs are for real.</LD>

<TE>   THANK you for your puff piece on Tom Leykis. I was afraid that you
were so busy trying to look like the New York Times you had forgotten
your self-appointed mission of mainstreaming pornography.</TE>
<TE>   You savaged Dr. Laura for a couple of disparaging references to
homosexuals (she deserved it). But you fawn all over Leykis, who
daily denigrates women on a much greater scale.</TE>
<TE>   Gwen Freeman</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IT is a cheap trick to exploit dormant sexism (or racism,
anti-Semitism, etc.) and claim that this is what listeners want to
hear, especially when there are no meaningful alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, it is telling that there are no fiery socialist DJs on the
corporate airwaves, entertaining listeners with vitriolic speeches
excoriating the world's capitalist bloodsuckers. While this type of
rhetoric would elucidate social reality in a far more relevant manner
than Leykis, Limbaugh, et al., its implications would threaten the
interests of the media's corporate owners and sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   Until the public controls the airwaves that they in fact own, we
will be condemned to listen to the dangerous scapegoating of cheap,
ignorant demagogues, of which Leykis is just one of many.</TE>

<LD>WHEN he wrote about "anonymous calls to The Times" in his review of
last week's Los Angeles Philharmonic program ("Salonen plays up the
drama of Shostakovich's ominous Sixth," Oct. 18), Mark Swed reached a
new low.</LD>
<LD>   If the calls were anonymous, then how does he know that they came
from orchestra members? And isn't just about anyone -- especially in
this city so full of aspiring actors -- perfectly capable of
approximating a fairly decent Russian accent these days?</LD>
<LD>   And even if the calls were legitimate, why does the reference to
them belong in a review of a performance, anyway?</LD>
<TE>   By mentioning them in his article, Swed clearly put himself on the
same unethical low level with the cowards making such calls.</TE>

<LD>MEASURE A is such a scam ("Museum campaign heats up," by Christopher
Reynolds, Oct. 21). When the Los Angeles County Museum of Art
announced its expensive and unnecessary redesign, they made it very
clear that no public money would be asked for or used. Now they're
trying to take the money from us anyway, by placing this
phony-baloney safety issue on the ballot.</LD>
<LD>   Fire and earthquake safety upgrades to protect our children? Why
not include puppies and old ladies? Shameless, manipulative and

<LD>STEVE Carney's Oct. 18 article, "Brokering peace at KPFK," misses the
point regarding staff concerns about KPFK-FM. He accurately
encapsulates what the station should be about: "radio by collective
-- with listeners and volunteers joining staff in programming and
management decisions," but the new general manager's approach
contradicts that.</LD>
<LD>   In spite of the years of struggle to prevent a takeover of
Pacifica by corporate-style forces, Pacifica is operating like a
corporation. Just the simple fact that there is a general manager
with ultimate authority puts the decision making for an entire
station in the hands of one person and their flaws, regardless of who
that person is.</LD>

<HD>'War Music' weighs destruction, creation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daryl H. Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first moments of "War Music," a new play by Bryan Davidson, are
meant to evoke that delicious sense of anticipation before a concert:
the swirling cacophony of the instrumentalists' warm-up, followed by
the conductor stepping onto the podium, raising his baton and....</LD>
<LD>   Just then, an air-raid siren screams.</LD>
<LD>   It's a sobering bit of symbolism, inviting the viewer to think not
just about war's disruptions but about all of the lives lost -- all
of the music silenced forever.</LD>
<TE>   How to endure that? In a haunting presentation by Playwrights'
Arena and the Echo Theater Company at the Los Angeles Theatre Center,
"War Music" suggests that the truest counterbalance to so much
destruction is to go on creating.</TE>
<TE>   Like an orchestral work, the play is divided into movements, each
inspired by the life of a composer -- Frank Bridge, Anton Webern and
Olivier Messiaen -- during World Wars I and II.</TE>
<TE>   The first movement charges into a WWI firefight that has pinned
two British soldiers to the ground. One is a pianist, Douglas Fox
(Jeremy Maxwell), a friend of Bridge's (Morgan Rusler). The battle
claims one of Fox's arms, prompting Bridge to write the piano piece
"Three Improvisations for the Left Hand," of which the "At Dawn"
section, woven into the action, trembles with the promise of renewal.</TE>
<TE>   Pondering Webern's accidental death at the hands of an American
soldier in post-WWII occupied Austria, the second movement focuses
not so much on the composer (Christopher Shaw) as on the GI (John
Prosky), whose life is shattered by the event, and an aspiring
musician (Maxwell) inspired by Webern.</TE>
<TE>   The final movement is inspired by "Quartet for the End of Time,"
which Messiaen wrote while a prisoner of war in 1941. Awaiting a
rehearsal of the piece, three fellow prisoner-musicians (Kevin
Crowley, Shaw and Prosky) enact a comic "Waiting for Godot"-like
routine while Messiaen (Maxwell) is led through the process of
creation by Our Lady of the Seven Sorrows (Nancy Bell).</TE>
<TE>   The play's gorgeously surreal visuals, staged by Jessica
Kubzansky, reach their fullest expression here. Wandering through an
ethereal forest (dangling strips of white fabric in Susan Gratch's
set design, painted in dreamy pastels by Jeremy Pivnick's lighting),
Messiaen gathers up all of the sorrow from the previous stories,
mixes it with such timeless beauty as birdsong, and turns it into an
enduring act of redemption.</TE>

<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sean Mitchell</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When my son and I passed through the gate to the upper deck at Edison
Field and started down the steps toward our seats, a strange
sensation came over me that had nothing to do with the novelty of
being at a post-season game involving the Angels. It had to do with
my ears. They weren't working normally. My son said something, but I
couldn't make out what -- I only saw his lips move. All other sound
was drowned out by a continuous, monstrous roar like the beginning of
one of those early battle scenes in "Gladiator."</LD>
<LD>   It was as if we had landed on another planet, where people who
looked like humans communicated only with 2-foot-long red plastic
tubes they slapped together furiously to create the sound of metal
drums. There were more than 40,000 pairs of them flapping from foul
pole to foul pole. Of all the gimmicks and marketing ideas that have
changed the face of major league baseball in the last 25 years -- the
wild card, inter-league play, retro uniform days, even the Angels'
big-screen rally monkey -- nothing has so altered the experience of a
game as much as these thunder sticks. They would be more suited to
professional wrestling or a tractor pull than baseball. I think they
are for people who don't really like baseball and need something to
do during the game other than watch it.</LD>
<TE>   For anyone who does like baseball, they are simply a pain in the
ear. They look so harmless on television, if a little silly,
fluttering in a sea of red, attached to all those Angels fans who
don't seem to mind looking like thousands of trained seals.</TE>
<TE>   But you have to be there in person to get the full,
migraine-inducing wavelength of whiteout noise they produce. I've
never been to a sporting event that was louder. No one expects a
baseball stadium to resemble an orchestra hall. And who doesn't want
to cheer their home teams' home runs and great plays? But there's
cheering, and there's unearthly din.</TE>
<TE>   I love baseball. Like many who came here from someplace else, it
has taken me years to transfer previous team allegiances to the
Dodgers and Angels. But the transfer was finally accomplished by
having a son born here who grew up with these teams as his. And I was
thrilled to be climbing the ramp at Edison Field with my 8-year-old
Little Leaguer beside me, feeling lucky to have secured two tickets
at the last minute to the third Angels-Twins American League
championship series playoff game.</TE>
<TE>   That lucky feeling lasted just until we left the concession
platform and hit the red wall of sound. In an instant my baseball
life flashed before my eyes. Our half a dozen trips to Dodger Stadium
this past season and the countless games I have attended in almost
two dozen major league stadiums across the country suddenly seemed a
romantic dream of something long ago and far away.</TE>
<TE>   As we found our seats in the second row of section 406, dodging
the flapping red tubes, a voice inside reminded me that all good
things come to an end. I thought, baseball has lasted more than 100
years and survived eight work stoppages, but it will not survive
noise sticks.</TE>
<TE>   In a way, the arrival of the thunder sticks is not such a surprise
in a culture where loud is good and louder is better. Automobiles,
their windows down and exploding with listen to me! music, rumble
proudly past parks and residences. Restaurants are designed to be so
loud that conversation is all but impossible. Movie soundtracks blast
you out of the theater. Why should we expect baseball to be any
different? Except that it is an intricate game that requires close
attention to appreciate. Try selling that in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   I carried my late-blooming admiration for the Angels and all that
Mike Scioscia has accomplished up that Edison Field ramp, but as I
tried in vain to talk to my son, I felt the unpleasant stirrings of
disaffection for the home team. How could this be?</TE>
<TE>   That old song lyric from Stephen Stills came back to me with new
meaning: "There's somethin' happening here, and what it is ain't
exactly clear." With the thunder sticks waving in front of us, it was
hard to see what was happening on the field. We couldn't talk
baseball, strategy, statistics -- all things we love to do when we
watch a game. And this was a championship game! But in the stands it
was just atavistic bedlam. Baseball for boors. And I have so tried to
like people from Orange County over the years, I really have.</TE>
<TE>   I knew I couldn't reveal such heresy to Devin, my son, but I
realized that for the first time in the playoffs I was secretly
rooting for Minnesota. It was a pragmatic decision. I figured if the
Twins could score some runs, it would silence the thunder sticks and
allow the semblance of what was once known as the national pastime to
return to Edison Field. And the Angels could come back and win the
series later.</TE>
<TE>   But this was not to be. It was a close, low-scoring game, a
nail-biter that kept the thunder sticks roaring at red-lining decibel
levels for more than three hours. I got a headache, and my ears
started to ring. But for Devin's sake I tried to conceal my
discomfort while praying that it didn't go extra innings.</TE>
<TE>   I couldn't help but wonder how many of these rooters in red were
simply overnight zealots, following the example of Michael Eisner,
the top Disney bean counter who suddenly became a camera-ready fan in
September after trying to unload the team for most of the season.
Everybody loves a winner. God bless America.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels would go on to win this night, 2-1, on a dramatic Troy
Glaus home run. I'm sure it was a great game to see at home on TV.
That's where I've been watching the World Series.</TE>

<HD>Catchy tales of youth from Britain's Streets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Natalie Nichols</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The concept of "the streets" has a more hard-core connotation in
American rap than the image projected by the English act the Streets,
a.k.a. Birmingham-born rapper and producer Mike Skinner, who brought
his blend of hip-hop and such dance styles as U.K. garage, two-step
and dub reggae to the Troubadour on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Raved about in its native land, the Streets' debut album,
"Original Pirate Material," sonically evokes the world inhabited by
disaffected working-class youth, who apparently spend their lives
playing video games, eating fast food, smoking pot, going to clubs,
drinking too much and disappointing their girlfriends. Skinner's
phrasing, and perhaps his claustrophobic testifying, have led some
U.S. critics to compare him to Eminem. But Skinner, 23, was
ultimately more upbeat on Thursday, never displaying the slow-burning
rage or harrowing confessionalism of our Slim Shady.</LD>
<LD>   The hourlong set featured additional vocalist Kevin Trail as well
as a drummer, bassist and keyboardist, which made the performance
slightly funkier than the album's often nerve-grinding shrillness.</LD>
<TE>   But despite energetic give-and-take with Trail, Skinner didn't
have the perverse magnetism of Em, or really much charisma at all
beyond the novelty of spewing out fetching British slang.</TE>
<TE>   Skinner came closer to the cultural reportage of the Clash or Sex
Pistols with some numbers, including the wistful standout "Weak
Become Heroes." Buoyant and catchy, it captured the innocent fun and
inevitable consequences of youthful raves with a sense of
transcendence as well as a dose of reality.</TE>

<HD>After 38 years, Statler Brothers pull off the road</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After 38 years on the road, the Statler Brothers are calling it
quits. After they play Salem, Va., today, they'll retire from
traveling as one of country music's most successful quartets.</LD>
<LD>   The group still plans to record, from its home base of Staunton,
Va.</LD>
<LD>   "We've been blessed," says Harold Reid, one of the original
members. "There's a lot of people out there with more talent than us
who have not been able to show what they could do."</LD>
<TE>   Phil Balsley, Lew DeWitt and Joe McDorman were the other original
Statlers. Don Reid, Harold's younger brother, replaced McDorman in
the early 1960s, and Jimmy Fortune took over for the ailing DeWitt in
the 1980s. DeWitt, who suffered from Crohn's disease, died in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   With hits such as "You Can't Have Your Kate and Edith, Too,"
"Carry Me Back" and "The Class of '57," the Statlers toured two out
of every three weeks at their peak in the 1970s and 1980s, produced
their own cable TV show for several years in the 1990s and recorded
more than 50 albums.</TE>

<LD>A veteran sitcom writer is suing the WB network and the producers of
"Reba," a show about a middle-aged soccer mom, claiming he was denied
promotion and finally fired because they thought he was too old.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers for Gary H. Miller, 54, whose previous credits include
"Laverne &amp; Shirley," "Bosom Buddies" and "The Fresh Prince of Bel
Air," say he was let go after being told the network wanted to hire
"greener writers" than him.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Syndicated radio talk show host Art Bell, whose late-night talk of
UFO sightings and conspiracy theories made him famous, has announced
his retirement. Bell, 57, told listeners this week that he'll retire
because of back problems.</LD>
<LD>   Regular guest host George Noory will replace Bell on Jan. 1.
Barbara Simpson will host on weekends. Bell plans to be an occasional
guest host for Noory.</LD>
<LD>   "Coast to Coast AM," heard locally from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. on
KFI-AM (640), will continue its current broadcast schedule until Dec.
31. Bell hosts three nights a week, Noory hosts three nights and
Simpson one night.</LD>
<TE>   Bell cryptically announced his retirement once before, in April
2000.</TE>
<TE>   But he returned to the air the following February, explaining that
he had needed to take time off to deal with family and legal issues
stemming from an assault on his son.</TE>

<HD>For real snipers, serial killings make a tough job tougher</HD>
<DH>Pro sharpshooters see work as a necessary evil and say
wannabes wrongly glorify it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Louise Roug</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the arrests Wednesday of John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo
in connection with the 13 shootings in the suburbs of Washington,
D.C., the country breathed a collective sigh of relief.</LD>
<LD>   But for some, Muhammad's arrest brought a new worry. The community
of professional snipers -- highly trained military personnel and law
enforcement officers -- feared the suspect's military background
would contribute to the distorted image of their profession.</LD>
<LD>   "We're deemed to be evil," said Carl Taylor, a former Marine
sniper and co-founder of Surgical Shooting Inc., a training school in
San Diego. "Snipers are the bastard children of the military
community. Everybody hates you."</LD>
<TE>   Army personnel records show that Muhammad had no affiliation with
sniper or special forces. Nevertheless, his military background "is
going to make life harder for us," Taylor said. "We fought this
battle over the decades, and every time some crackpot with a gun goes
out there and shoots rounds, they call him a sniper."</TE>
<TE>   All soldiers entering the Army undergo basic training with M-16
rifles. Once every year, they have to requalify, earning "marksman,"
"sharpshooter" or "expert" marks. Muhammad ultimately earned only a
sharpshooter mark, so to compare him to a military sniper would be
inaccurate, said Robert Castelli, who teaches at John Jay College of
Criminal Justice in New York. "The analogy is playing for the varsity
basketball team as opposed to the NBA," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The arrests capped a month in which professional snipers distanced
themselves not only from the shootings, but also from civilian sniper
enthusiasts.</TE>
<TE>   "It has brought a lot of attention to the sniper community," said
Derrick Bartlett, president of the American Sniper Assn. and a SWAT
sniper for the Fort Lauderdale Police Department in Florida. "For
over 30 years police snipers have labored in silence, saving lives.
Now, people are suddenly wanting to talk."</TE>
<TE>   On the association's Web site, Bartlett recently posted a "Letter
to the Media," detailing the group's official position:</TE>
<TE>   "The individual responsible for the string of killings in the D.C.
area is not a sniper.... He is a serial killer who is using a rifle
to indiscriminately kill innocent civilians....</TE>
<TE>   "We recognize the existence of the so-called sniper subculture. We
know about the groupies, wannabes and enthusiasts to whom this is a
hobby and a weekend fantasy. For the trained professionals we
represent, this is our job. We do not take this lightly."</TE>
<TE>   "The people who are involved in this, they're not demons of
darkness ... or unemotional killing machines -- that's not it," said
Roy Huntington, a former San Diego police officer and editor of
American Handgunner, a magazine for firearms enthusiasts. Snipers "do
this really dirty job for the rest of us."</TE>
<TE>   And pulling the trigger is a cause for neither bragging nor
celebration, Huntington said. It's a failure. "That they had to pull
the trigger means negotiations, or something else, failed. It's truly
last resort," he said. The informal sniper motto is "One shot, one
kill." To a subculture of aficionados, slogans like that and "Reach
out and touch someone" fuel the sniper myth and are worn on T-shirts.
Sniping has been glorified in video games such as Counter Strike and
Silent Scope and in movies such as "Sniper" (1993), starring Tom
Berenger. There are other stars too: Marine Gunnery Sgt. Carlos
Hathcock II, one of the most effective snipers of the Vietnam War
with 93 confirmed kills, has attained mythic status.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to rub elbows with us," Bartlett said. "Something else
in their lives doesn't gel, so they love the fantasy and playing the
game." The fantasy is so prevalent that several Web sites, such as
www.phonysnipers.com, are dedicated to exposing the poseurs.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a literal explosion of literature, pamphlets,
videos and Web sites that ... glorify the sniper culture and the job
that professional snipers do," said Tom Diaz, a senior policy analyst
at the Washington-based Violence Policy Center, a gun-control
advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   On the Sniperworld Web site, banners advertise Russian sniper
scopes. Eric's Sniper Page offers a step-by-step guide to sewing your
own camouflage suit, called a ghillie suit. And the how-to video
"Ultimate Sniper" is, according to its promotional material, "crammed
with information on the three great sniping skills areas:
Marksmanship, Tactics and Fieldcraft."</TE>
<TE>   In a 1999 report titled "One Shot, One Kill," Diaz warned that as
the gun market became saturated, some manufacturers found that
military and police sniper rifles were among the few growth areas and
increasingly turned their attention to selling them to civilians. And
for those interested in practicing their precision-shooting skills,
some schools, such as Storm Mountain Training School in West
Virginia, offer civilians classes in sniping, including elements of
stalking and concealment -- neither of which has a sports
application, Diaz said.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't think of any reason why a private citizen needs to learn
sniper skills," Bartlett said. But the 18-year veteran understands
the allure of the sniper myth. "Every time we're depicted in the
movies, it's the lone wolf -- the man who's defiant to authority and
outside the law," he said. "But that's not the way we work. If people
saw how we work, they'd be bored."</TE>

<LD>Among journalists, the International Herald Tribune is one of those
names that carries an inescapably romantic set of associations.</LD>
<LD>   The world may have changed in all sorts of laudable and lamentable
ways, and the IHT -- as it is crisply known -- may long ago have
moved its newsroom from central Paris to one of the city's sprawling
postindustrial suburbs, but somehow the mention of its name still
conjures up images of trench coats, Gauloises and cold demi-blonds at
Brasserie Lipp.</LD>
<LD>   That was part of the reason the journalistic world took such acute
notice this week when the New York Times put a financial gun to the
Washington Post's head and ended the 50-50 partnership under which
the IHT has been run for the last 35 years, leaving the New York
paper as sole proprietor.</LD>
<TE>   "Among managers at the New York Times and the Washington Post, the
IHT has a special emotional place," said Martin Kaplan, associate
dean and director of the Norman Lear Center at USC's Annenberg School
of Communications. "So many of their owners, executives and
top-flight people either went through there or read it at a crucial
time in their lives that they think of it as a kind of romantic
finishing school. Owning it is a big deal to them."</TE>
<TE>   But there was more than nostalgia at work in the Times' decision
to pay $70 million for a money-losing newspaper that publishes six
days a week and sells slightly more than 250,000 copies around the
world, about 40% of them as bulk purchases by hotels and airlines.</TE>
<TE>   And those other factors are of genuine interest to readers and
viewers of serious news, because they suggest two important
realizations about the journalistic future: One is that the Internet
has yet to catch on as a way of distributing journalism, even on the
international level, where its quick acceptance once was all but
assumed. The other is that the globalization of information, like
that of capital, is taking place in English and in the style familiar
to American readers.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, analysts say, the Times was willing to pay a premium for an
"old media" property because it believes its future must involve
global expansion, which cannot be achieved electronically.</TE>
<TE>   Kaplan points out that when Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr.
announced the purchase, "he said they were buying it to extend their
brand. A business -- even a newspaper -- has to grow and not just win
Pulitzers and stand for excellence. If you're the New York Times,
which already has expanded nationally, at least in the elite market,
you have to extend your brand to Europe and Asia, where the Times
name may have the cachet of the Chanel logo."</TE>
<TE>   According to Kaplan, the decision to do that in print "is a kind
of acknowledgment of where the business model for new media stands.
The theory that the Internet is a way to profitably extend the reach
of a publication just hasn't gone very far. Lots of people have tried
it, and nobody has made any money. The purchase of the IHT is further
confirmation that an adjustment based on sad experience is underway."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, according to sources at the IHT and the Times, the
latter's uncharacteristically aggressive approach to the deal may be
explained by a little-noticed provision in the partnership agreement.
Under its terms, even if the Times elected to publish its own
international edition, the number of copies it could distribute was
capped.</TE>
<TE>   As the Post's Donald E. Graham confirmed in a memo about the sale
to his editors and foreign correspondents, "If the Post did not sell,
the Times said it would start its own international edition anyway,
intending to sell as many copies as allowed under the IHT partnership
agreement. The Times also said it would block any cash infusion into
the IHT, which the partnership agreement would permit it to do."</TE>
<TE>   The Times, in other words, was willing to lose money for as long
as it took to starve the Herald Tribune out of existence in order to
win the right to sell as many printed copies as the market will bear.</TE>
<TE>   Playing that hard a ball requires confidence that a game worth
winning is underway -- which, analysts say, appears to be true. In
fact, the only journalistic media with a viable global future -- CNN
International, the IHT, the Wall Street Journal's international
editions, Britain's Financial Times and the Economist -- publish in
English according to the prevailing ethical norms of American
journalism.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of it is that English is the Esperanto of our childhood
dreams," USC's Kaplan said. "It used to look as if the Tower of Babel
was our fate, but it turns out everybody speaks English whether they
want to or not because it is the lingua franca of commercial
success."</TE>
<TE>   According to Orville Schell, dean of UC Berkeley's Graduate School
of Journalism, cultural factors also have given U.S.-style journalism
global traction. Speaking by telephone from a villa outside Sienna,
Italy, Schell cited "two things I think are at work here:</TE>
<TE>   "One is the way news is done in American and elite British
operations. The other is that our culture is a large imperial force,
projecting itself around the world to create new markets for itself.</TE>
<TE>   "Four kilometers from where I'm sitting is a little town where you
can buy the IHT at the newsstand. Who is buying it? Americans who
don't speak Italian, like me. It's a formula that works around the
world, in part, because Americans now are everywhere and most of them
have no interest in or ability to absorb anybody else's version of
the news. We've created a compelling product, and the market for it,
by dispersing ourselves throughout the world while maintaining our
very provincial tastes and unwillingness to speak other languages."</TE>
<TE>   That, according to Schell, is "the harsh face of this
globalization process. But it isn't the only one. What is it about
American media outlets that allows them to project themselves so
widely? I think it's that the principles behind American journalism
highlight balance and objectivity unlike, say, the ideological
European press.</TE>
<TE>   "No other country has so clearly a delineated set of journalistic
norms," said Schell, who spent much of his journalistic career as a
correspondent in China. "That doesn't mean we don't regularly fail to
meet them. But if you go to France, nobody can tell you what their
canon of ethics is. Because American journalists can do that, it
creates a more universal template of news." As Schell sees it, "Even
though Americans criticize our media, people around the world are
addicted to it for very good reasons. The best American media is very
good because it is a reflection of American universalism, of our
striving to be all things to all people. And even though we regularly
fail, no other nation has that admirable pretension."</TE>
<TE>   Fair enough, so long as it's a pretense that continues to wear a
trench coat.</TE>

<HD>It's myth on the move</HD>
<DH>Fabulous Monsters Performance Group uses varied styles and
mediums to retell an ancient story in 'Ramayana 2K2.'</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ancient myth meets techno music and eclectic contemporary dance in
"Ramayana 2K2," a loving, overly detailed retelling by the locally
based Fabulous Monsters Performance Group at Highways Performance
Space in Santa Monica.</LD>
<LD>   Premiered Thursday with numerous technical glitches but an
endearing sweetness of spirit, this 2 1/2-hour essay in
cross-cultural movement theater used onstage narrators and recorded
dialogue to convey the plot specifics embellished in a rich array of
styles by choreographer Stephen Hues and fight choreographer Richie
C. Marin. From belly dance to hip-hop, pole-fighting to attack
gymnastics, this "Ramayana" had abundant movement resources in its
arsenal.</LD>
<LD>   However, writer-director Robert A. Prior included so much
expository text, and so many marginal episodes, that the story as a
whole never really came alive.</LD>
<TE>   Even the final scenes became overburdened by talky explanations
and only a few gestural passages (the monkey Hanuman meeting the
imprisoned Sita, for example) achieved the immediacy and emotional
power that any "Ramayana" should generate.</TE>
<TE>   Happily, the attractive, tireless 18-member cast kept the dancing,
fighting and mime full of feeling, with Rich Welmers (Rama) looking
as elegantly attenuated as a Javanese rod puppet and Anahata Spurkel
(Sita) exuding a serene eroticism that made the war fought over her
entirely plausible.</TE>
<TE>   Managing to look menacing and even a mite depraved in the world's
tackiest bathrobe, Will Watkins (Ravana) supplied unfailingly juicy,
over-the-top villainy. In contrast, the deft, understated physical
comedy of Ari Jamon (Hanuman), the relaxed nobility of Carlos Madrid
Mora (Lakshman) and the pointed intelligence of Alexandra Saalik
(co-narrator and three secondary roles) ably supported the more
flamboyant portrayals.</TE>
<TE>   Projections by Yo Suzuki bathed the cast in vibrating colors and
music from two-dozen sources established an exotic, contemporary
soundscape.</TE>

<HD>New leads energize 'Lady Macbeth'</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Kirov Opera may not have brought its best-known singers along for
its touring production of Shostakovich's "Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk,"
which Los Angeles Opera is presenting in daily performances at the
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion through Tuesday. But that may be just as
well. As run by conductor Valery Gergiev, this ambitious company does
a remarkable job in discovering and fostering talent. With at least
triple casts for all the principals and even some of the smaller
roles, these performances provide a showcase for Russian singing.</LD>
<LD>   Not all of the singers will be young, fresh discoveries, of
course. On opening night, Wednesday, Katerina and Sergei, the young
merchant's wife who finds liberation through murder and her rakish
lover, were stout and mature, if vocally impressive. Thursday night,
they were replaced by Irina Loskutova and Oleg Balashov (who was
scheduled to sing only on Sunday). Younger and more theatrically
credible, this couple made Shostakovich's score seem slightly less
satirically surreal and more vivid, and made the opera's infamous sex
scene less like parody.</LD>
<TE>   Balashov, who has been performing at the Mariinsky Theatre just
for three years, is just the kind of likable young singer the Kirov
is noted for getting on stage while the voice and persona are still
in first flush. A robust tenor, he had exactly the right boyish
cockiness to allow Sergei to quickly break down Katerina's defenses.
His is a career to watch.</TE>
<TE>   Loskutova, a soprano most effective in her darker, lower range,
upholds Katerina's dignity even while giving into her more carnal
extremes. Though tempestuous, she demonstrates a superb
self-possession, impressively maintained through Katerina's
degrading, tragic end.</TE>
<TE>   The cruel Boris was sung by Gennady Bezzubenkov, an imposing
Russian bass, who had been the comic Priest on Wednesday. But there
was yet another fine, imposing Russian bass, Grigory Karassev, tall
and funny, to take his priestly place. Victor Vikhrov as a shabby
peasant, Alexander Morozov as an old convict and Evgeny Nikitin as an
slapstick police sergeant were all able.</TE>

<LD>Hey kids, if investigating the 1992 disappearance and possible
drowning of a young boy at summer camp sounds like a fun warmup for
Halloween, Nickelodeon has just the show for you.</LD>
<LD>   "Scaredy Camp," a five-part series premiering Sunday at 8:30 p.m.,
uses this dubious premise to create what turns out to be a rather
entertaining show that mixes "Survivor"-type team competition with
some "Blair Witch" spookiness. It's all geared to the youthful Nick
audience, of course, so other than that rather unsavory premise,
things don't get too out of hand.</LD>
<LD>   The series opens by citing what it calls "an actual legend": On
July 26, 1992, a boy named Dennis Williams vanished from Camp
Lindenwood without a trace, and some claim he has haunted the place
ever since. And now two teams -- one of three boys, the other of
three girls -- will spend the next four days and five nights at the
camp vying to solve the mystery so they can put Dennis' spirit to
rest.</LD>
<TE>   Each morning, there are contests of skill and strategy to
determine which team will return late that night for the chance to
solve a piece of the puzzle.</TE>
<TE>   In searching for clues, team members must decipher a message
written on toilet paper, inspect a bathtub filled with murky water
and stumble around a campground bathroom in total darkness (now
that's scary).</TE>
<TE>   Hosting the show is Emma Wilson, the daughter of former "Weakest
Link" host Anne Robinson. Wilson has the English accent, but if she
inherited her mom's nasty streak, she managed to keep it under wraps.</TE>
<TE>   "Scaredy Camp," kicking off a week of Halloween programming for
Nickelodeon, will air half-hour episodes for four consecutive nights
beginning Sunday, with the series finale scheduled for Nov. 3 at 7
p.m.</TE>

<HD>During siege in Moscow, theaters rethink security</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Matt Wolf</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>LONDON -- Some London theaters are increasing security in reaction to
the siege of a Moscow theater by Chechen rebels, while on Broadway
additional measures also have been taken to ensure safety.</LD>
<LD>   But most European theater operators said Friday they were
satisfied with precautions already in place.</LD>
<LD>   In New York, Philip Smith, president of the Shubert Organization,
which owns more than a dozen Broadway theaters, said security "has
been stepped up in recent days," but he declined to discuss
specifics.</LD>
<TE>   Smith added that the company already has its own security force
and "we do liaison with the Police Department."</TE>
<TE>   Arnold Crook, chairman and chief executive of two of London's most
elegant theaters -- the Theatre Royal Haymarket and the Strand --
said Friday he was hiring more guards and requiring bag checks at the
door.</TE>
<TE>   Both venues are housing hit shows: The Haymarket has David Hare's
"The Breath of Life," starring Judi Dench and Maggie Smith, while
Brenda Blethyn is at the Strand in George Bernard Shaw's "Mrs.
Warren's Profession."</TE>
<TE>   Other London theater operators said they're attentive but a little
more relaxed.</TE>
<TE>   "We always ask staff to be alert," said Nicholas Allott, managing
director of Cameron Mackintosh Ltd., which owns seven theaters and
manages two others in the West End.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Paris' two opera houses -- the ornate, 19th century
Palais Garnier and the ultramodern Opera Bastille -- said they
started searching bags after the Sept. 11 attacks in the United
States and weren't ordering additional precautions.</TE>
<TE>   La Scala opera house in Milan, Italy, and several theaters in Rome
likewise reported no changes in security measures. It was the same in
Berlin.</TE>
<TE>   Though he is tightening security at the Haymarket and the Strand,
Crook said it was important not to scare audiences away from London's
theater district.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just not possible to have guards standing in attendance with
rifles," he said. "It's hard enough to get people to the West End as
it is."</TE>

<HD>Showdown Looms Over Arthritis Medications</HD>
<DH>With Humira, Abbott Laboratories plans to give real
competition to Amgen's popular but hard-to-get treatment Enbrel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Denise Gellene</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In large stainless-steel tanks that look as if they belong in a beer
factory, Abbott Laboratories Inc. is brewing what could become the
next big rheumatoid arthritis drug.</LD>
<LD>   Abbott's Humira, already tested in 2,300 patients, poses a direct
threat to Enbrel, the rheumatoid arthritis treatment that is the
crown jewel of Amgen Inc.'s $9.6-billion acquisition of Immunex Corp.
Though Humira is months from market, the rivalry between Abbott and
Amgen already is intense.</LD>
<LD>   The competition for patients got off to an early start this month
as Abbott made Humira available to as many as 5,000 people with
advanced disease through a clinical trial. Abbott expects to grab
some of the 32,000 patients who are on a waiting list for Enbrel, a
drug in high demand but in chronic short supply.</LD>
<TE>   The showdown with Abbott may decide whether Amgen's decision to
buy Immunex last December was a stroke of genius or a costly blunder.
Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, grew into the world's largest
biotechnology company chiefly by protecting the monopoly held by its
anti-anemia drug, Epogen.</TE>
<TE>   With Enbrel, Chairman and Chief Executive Kevin W. Sharer is
taking conservatively run Amgen into one of the most competitive drug
categories in biotechnology. Amgen has lowered Enbrel sales forecasts
twice since the takeover.</TE>
<TE>   Analyst Martin Auster of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey said Amgen
won't make money on Enbrel until 2005, a year later than expected.
"It is hard to understand why they felt a need to do the deal," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Amgen rose $1.11 to close at $49.79 on Nasdaq on Friday.
Abbott rose 63 cents to $43.08 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The adversaries will square off this weekend in New Orleans at a
medical meeting attended by 8,300 arthritis specialists. For Abbott,
the scientific conference offers a critical opportunity to tout
Humira, which it cannot advertise because it is an unapproved drug.</TE>
<TE>   Abbott executives predict patients will prefer Humira, a
longer-lasting drug that is taken less often than Enbrel. Humira is
taken twice monthly; Enbrel is a twice-weekly drug. The medications
are injected, like insulin.</TE>
<TE>   "For some patients, that will make a difference," said
Northwestern University rheumatologist Eric Ruderman. A consultant to
Amgen and Abbott, Ruderman said the drugs otherwise appear
comparable. The drugs block TNF, a molecule responsible for the joint
inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis, which affects 2.1 million
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "There is going to be a big marketing battle, and no one knows how
it is going to play out," Ruderman said.</TE>
<TE>   The early outcome hinges on when Amgen can end a two-year shortage
of Enbrel that has driven the number of patients on the drug below
79,000 from 85,000 in March. Since Amgen closed the Immunex purchase
in July, completion and approval of an Enbrel factory in West
Greenwich, R.I., has been its top priority.</TE>
<TE>   Teams of outside experts have poked around every corner of the
plant in preparation for a Food and Drug Administration inspection
next month.</TE>
<TE>   A clean review from the FDA would allow Amgen to open the factory
before Humira's expected launch in April.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Amgen must rebuild the confidence of patients
and doctors who stopped using Enbrel as supplies tightened. A week
after Abbott announced its clinical trial, Amgen moved to blunt the
effect by launching a 5,000-patient trial of its own for people with
rheumatoid arthritis, using supplies of Enbrel made in Rhode Island
that have not been cleared for sale.</TE>
<TE>   In advance of this weekend's medical meeting, Amgen took
influential doctors on a tour of its factory, hoping to create a buzz
among rheumatologists.</TE>
<TE>   Abbott, too, is courting physicians. For months now, it has
sponsored dinner meetings where clinicians who are consultants to
Abbott lecture doctors about rheumatoid arthritis and answer
questions about Humira. Five hundred doctors have expressed interest
in offering the drug free to patients in Abbott's clinical trial.</TE>
<TE>   Leading a tour of Abbott's factory in Worcester, Mass., last week,
production chief Peter Moesta showcased twin 6,000-liter tanks that
can produce enough Humira to supply 200,000 patients annually, more
than twice the number of people on Enbrel.</TE>
<TE>   To build its stockpile, Abbott also is using a 3,000-liter tank to
grow colonies of cells programmed to produce Humira, an antibody
drug.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Amgen's new factory will use six 8,000-liter tanks to
produce enough medication for 100,000 patients, Moesta said. Amgen
depends on outside contractor Boehringer-Ingleheim for current
supplies of Enbrel, which is tricky to make.</TE>
<TE>   After the tour, Abbott gathered 10 grateful rheumatoid arthritis
patients who received Humira in a clinical trial. Their doctor,
Charles Birbara, an associate professor of medicine at the University
of Massachusetts, said three of the 75 patients he has treated with
Humira have had serious side effects: tuberculosis, an unusual lung
infection and encephalitis.</TE>
<TE>   Abbott released a study Friday showing that the infection rate
among patients on Humira was about the same as for patients taking
only traditional rheumatoid arthritis drugs, such as methotrexate.
The study didn't compare Humira with Enbrel.</TE>
<TE>   The timing for FDA approval of Humira isn't certain. The agency
has been accused lately of dragging its feet, and Abbott's
half-million-page application for the drug, hauled to Washington from
Chicago in an 18-wheeler, was the largest ever submitted to the FDA.</TE>
<TE>   And Abbott has a history of manufacturing problems. It relaunched
Abbokinase this month after withdrawing the blood-clot buster in 1998
because of quality lapses.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Abbott isn't Amgen's only worry. Genentech Inc., Biogen
Inc. and Pharmacia Corp. are among a clutch of companies developing
drugs for inflammatory disease.</TE>
<TE>   In June, a Johnson &amp; Johnson drug knocked Enbrel from its perch as
the best-selling biotechnology drug for inflammatory disease. Until
recently, J&amp;J's Remicade hadn't been viewed as competitive with
Enbrel because it causes allergic reactions in some patients and must
be administered intravenously by doctors.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of Remicade, which also is used for Crohn's disease, a bowel
disorder, rose 63% to $293 million in the third quarter. Enbrel sales
sank 7% to an estimated $185 million during the same period.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts and physicians doubt that Amgen will reclaim patients
doing well on Remicade, which should post more than $1 billion in
sales in 2002, compared with less than $800 million for Enbrel.</TE>
<TE>   In the eyes of some, Amgen can afford to lose rheumatoid arthritis
patients to competitors because Enbrel is the only biotechnology drug
approved for psoriatic arthritis, which affects at least 500,000
people.</TE>
<TE>   "Amgen's strategy is to press ahead in other indications," said
Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown analyst Dennis Harp.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Amgen must do everything right to make the Immunex
purchase pay off as promised, with Enbrel sales of $3 billion by
2005.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, Lehman Bros. analyst Craig C. Parker predicted that the
market for all drugs in Enbrel's class would total just $4 billion by
2006. If he's right, Amgen needs to capture every penny that does not
already go to J&amp;J to reach its previously stated goal.</TE>
<TE>   Said Amgen Vice President Kevin Young, head of the company's
Enbrel business, "It is going to be an interesting spring."</TE>

<HD>Beckman Misses Quarterly Forecasts but Upbeat on '03</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald D. White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beckman Coulter Inc. on Friday delivered a cautiously optimistic
forecast for 2003 after the maker of medical diagnostic equipment
delivered third-quarter results that fell short of expectations.</LD>
<LD>   Net income for the Fullerton-based company slipped to $32.1
million, or 49 cents a share, from $33 million, or 52 cents, in the
same period a year ago. Per-share earnings were 13 cents below the
company's predictions at the end of the second quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Sales rose 5% from the year-earlier period, but currency-hedging
expenses squeezed the bottom line, the company said.</LD>
<TE>   Chairman John P. Wareham blamed what he called a sustained and
surprisingly sharp decrease in biotech and pharmaceutical industry
research spending for missing forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   Beckman Coulter, which has more than 9,500 employees, designs,
manufactures and markets instruments, chemistry equipment, software
and other supplies that are used in such fields as medical research
and drug discovery.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Financial Officer Amin I. Khalifa said the firm was
well-positioned to take advantage of renewed research spending, but
said that was not expected to occur until mid- or late 2003.</TE>
<TE>   For 2003, the company expects sales to grow 5.5% to 6.5% and
earnings to rise 11% to 13%.</TE>
<TE>   Beckman Coulter shares rose 6 cents to $28.77 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch Global Securities analyst Timothy Lee said investors
were taking a wait-and-see approach.</TE>
<TE>   "They are looking for some sign of a rebound" in research
spending, "but that has yet to be seen," Lee said.</TE>

<HD>Regulators to Probe Enron's Wind Units</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael A. Hiltzik</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal power regulators said Friday that they would investigate
whether Enron Corp. illegally kept ownership of three California wind
generation firms it had been ordered to sell in 1997. The inquiry
could lead to an order for millions of dollars in refunds to Southern
California Edison, which bought the wind power at above-market rates.</LD>
<LD>   The investigation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission aims
to determine whether former Enron executives fraudulently concealed
Enron's ownership in the three companies, which operate wind farms
near Palm Springs, in the Tehachapi Pass outside Bakersfield and at
other locations in the state.</LD>
<LD>   Federal rules allow companies that generate power from wind and
other renewable sources to charge above-market rates for their
output. A technicality of federal utilities law required Enron to
sell much of its interest in the three wind farm companies in 1997 to
retain their preferred status.</LD>
<TE>   If FERC determines that the wind companies did not properly
qualify for preferential rates, it could order a refund of the
difference between what the companies were permitted to charge Edison
and the lower, regulated price Edison paid to generate or purchase
conventional power.</TE>
<TE>   Utility industry sources said that at various times during its
contracts with the wind companies, Southern California Edison, the
utility arm of Rosemead-based Edison International, may have paid
them two to nine times the regulated rate for power. Moreover, the
Securities and Exchange Commission said in a complaint that the wind
companies reaped about $2.7 million in unlawful profit from 1997
through 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow and another
ex-Enron executive, Michael J. Kopper, already have been accused by
the Justice Department and the SEC of concealing Enron's ownership of
the wind farms and profiting from the subterfuge.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Edison could collect any mandated refunds from Enron is
unclear. The Houston company is under Bankruptcy Court protection. An
Enron spokesman confirmed that the wind companies are currently
regarded as Enron subsidiaries.</TE>
<TE>   Enron told FERC it was selling the wind generators to two
independent partnerships. In fact, the SEC alleged this month that
these partnerships had been created by Fastow and Kopper as fronts
allowing Enron secretly to retain ownership. The two also used the
arrangement to "secretly siphon off for themselves" proceeds of the
sales by paying themselves portions of the revenue the wind
generators recorded, the SEC said.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow reaped nearly $190,000 in gains from the wind-power deals,
the SEC says. Much of that, the SEC says, was funneled from the
companies from 1997 to 2000 in the guise of annual "gifts" of $10,000
to Fastow's wife and two children from Kopper and his domestic
partner.</TE>

<HD>Agreement to Buy Galleria Reported</HD>
<DH>General Growth is the acquirer, sources say. The price is
expected to exceed $400 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jesus Sanchez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mall giant General Growth Properties Inc. has agreed to buy the
Glendale Galleria, one of Southern California's largest shopping
centers, according to people familiar with the property.</LD>
<LD>   The 250-store mall will dramatically raise General Growth's
presence in the Los Angeles area, where the company owns or manages
about half a dozen shopping centers. None of them approaches the
Galleria's sales, which is $525 per square foot annually, among the
highest in the nation, industry observers said. The price is expected
to exceed $400 million, in line with other mall transactions.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a pretty solid property, and it has a significant market
draw," said Jack Kyser, chief economist with the Los Angeles County
Economic Development Corp. "This is something that [any mall
operator] would want to lay their hands on."</LD>
<TE>   Daniel Donahue, chairman of the mall's management company, Donahue
Schriber, would not identify the buyer. But he confirmed that a
publicly traded company was in escrow to purchase the mall and had
until Nov. 1 to complete its due diligence. The
1.5-million-square-foot shopping center is a joint venture that
includes health insurer Cigna Corp. and the New York State Teachers'
Retirement System.</TE>
<TE>   Executives at Chicago-based General Growth, a real estate
investment fund, could not be reached for comment. The firm owns or
manages 163 shopping malls nationwide, including the Baldwin Hills
Crenshaw Plaza in Los Angeles, Media City Center in Burbank and
Montclair Plaza in Montclair.</TE>
<TE>   The Galleria, which sprawls over two blocks in the heart of
Glendale, joins a long list of major shopping center properties that
have traded hands in recent months as investors pay top dollar for
well-located malls.</TE>
<TE>   The Glendale Galleria has remained a top draw as its owners have
continually expanded the 26-year-old property, attracted new
retailers and experimented with new concepts, such as a section
devoted to young shoppers called the Zone.</TE>

<HD>Former CalPERS Lawyer Named to Panel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathy M. Kristof</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kayla J. Gillan's appointment to the new national accounting
oversight board is being welcomed by corporate governance activists
who say she will be an impassioned voice for the interests of
individual investors.</LD>
<LD>   Gillan, former chief counsel at the California Public Employees'
Retirement System, was named Friday to the five-member Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board. The panel was created this year to crack
down on an accounting industry at the center of recent corporate
scandals. "She will be the conscience of that organization," said
Nell Minow, editor of the Corporate Library, a corporate watchdog Web
site, and author of several books on corporate governance.</LD>
<LD>   Gillan's track record as an investor advocate, burnished during
her tenure at CalPERS, will be especially important because the
Securities and Exchange Commission, with the backing of Chairman
Harvey L. Pitt, opted to select a non-accountant to head the
oversight board.</LD>
<TE>   "She is someone you can depend on to be fair and look out for the
public interest," said Phil Angelides, California state treasurer.
"Particularly in light of Pitt's actions," he added, "Gillan's
appointment becomes all the more important."</TE>
<TE>   While Gillan didn't give specifics about what her agenda would be
as a member of the board, she said Friday that she would work hard to
establish the panel's independence and maintain the integrity of
corporate financial statements and the securities markets.</TE>
<TE>   "I suspect that we all come with different perspectives, but have
the shared vision of restoring confidence and protecting the
investing public," she said.</TE>
<TE>   At 43, Gillan is something of a pioneer in the movement to reform
the way America's companies are run.</TE>
<TE>   A graduate of Cal State Sacramento, she completed law school at UC
Davis and less than two years later went to work at CalPERS -- where
she remained until she left in July to become vice president of
Washington-based Independent Fiduciary Services.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of her arrival, CalPERS, which manages $135 billion in
pension assets, was distressed by the emergence of "greenmail," a
tactic used by entrenched managements to thwart legitimate corporate
buyouts. The CalPERS board wanted to be more involved as a
shareholder and needed a staff attorney to take on the project.</TE>
<TE>   "I was the junior person on the staff, and no one else
volunteered, so I raised my hand and said, 'Pick me! Pick me!' " said
Gillan, who lives in Elk Grove, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   She spent the next 16 years creating standards of conduct for
corporate boards and negotiating with managers when CalPERS believed
that a company was breaking the rules.</TE>
<TE>   "She is very fair and very calm, which will be important in
Washington," said Richard H. Koppes, partner with Jones, Day, Reavis
&amp; Pogue in Sacramento and Gillan's former boss.</TE>

<HD>Lockheed Earnings Soar 36% in Quarter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Pae</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lockheed Martin Corp., bolstered by a surge in orders for weapons and
defense-related technologies, Friday posted a 36% jump in
third-quarter earnings and said it was raising its financial forecast
for the rest of the year.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's largest defense contractor, benefiting from the
biggest defense buildup in more than two decades, said net income for
the quarter ended Sept. 30 jumped to $290 million, or 64 cents a
share, from $213 million, or 50 cents, a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   The sharp rise was fueled by the Pentagon ramping up development
of the firm's F/A-22 and F-35 fighter jets, the nation's
next-generation combat aircraft, company executives said.</LD>
<TE>   Sales at Lockheed's aeronautics division, which also makes F-16
fighter jets and military cargo planes, climbed 15% in the quarter
and 35% for the first nine months.</TE>
<TE>   The division includes operations in Palmdale, where about 4,000
engineers work at the supersecret Skunk Works developing classified
aircraft. After downsizing for much of the 1990s, executives there
foresee steady growth amid the uptick in defense spending. President
Bush this week approved a 14% increase in the current fiscal year's
defense budget, the largest jump in two decades.</TE>
<TE>   In all, Lockheed's revenue in the third quarter climbed 5% to
$6.54 billion from $6.22 billion last year.</TE>
<TE>   The results were in line with analysts' expectations. Still,
shares of the Bethesda, Md.-based company fell $2.47, or 4%, to
$56.63 on the New York Stock Exchange after the earnings results were
released, as investors fretted about Lockheed's pension fund income
that has been battered by the bear market.</TE>
<TE>   With growing orders, Lockheed said it now expects sales to reach
$26 billion for 2002, up from a previous estimate of $25.4 billion to
$26 billion.</TE>

<LD>   Bulls believe some of the $2.2 trillion stashed in safe but
low-yielding money market funds might help fuel the budding stock
rally -- if investors gain confidence that equities won't falter yet
again, prolonging the 2 1/2-year-old bear market.</LD>
<TE>   Stocks plunged to five-year lows Oct. 9, but now the market is
nearing its seasonal sweet spot: Historically, November through
January has been the most lucrative span, according to the Stock
Trader's Almanac.</TE>
<TE>   In Friday's trading, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 126.65
points, or 1.5%, to 8,443.99; the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index climbed
15.15 points, or 1.7%, to 897.65; and the tech-laced Nasdaq composite
surged 32.42 points, or 2.5%, to 1,331.13, as all three indexes
widened their gains late in the session.</TE>
<TE>   Winners topped losers by 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange and
by more than 3 to 2 on Nasdaq, although volume was modest.</TE>
<TE>   For the week, the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 added 1.5%, while the Nasdaq
composite rose 3.4%. Since Oct. 9, the Dow has risen about 16%.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Friday's stock rally, Treasury yields dropped for the
third day in a row as reports showed durable-goods orders and
consumer confidence fell more than expected in recent surveys, adding
to evidence that an economic rebound is slackening. The yield on the
benchmark 10-year T-note eased to 4.09% from 4.12% on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   In the tech stock sector, Costa Mesa-based Emulex surged $4.08 to
$17.88 after the maker of computer circuit cards raised profit
forecasts for its fiscal second quarter. Analysts at Deutsche Bank
Securities and Morgan Keegan upgraded the stock, which has sunk from
a peak of $112.75 in March 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Among major tech names, Microsoft added $1.45 to $52.68, IBM
gained $2.46 to $74.56, Hewlett-Packard climbed 82 cents to $14.62
and Intel rose 96 cents to $16.59.</TE>
<TE>   In the pharmaceutical industry, Schering-Plough and Wyeth advanced
after Lehman Bros. raised its rating on the stocks, calling them
undervalued relative to prospects for profit growth. Schering-Plough
rose $1.23 to $20.35 and Wyeth gained $1.24 to $34.50. Elsewhere in
the sector, Pfizer added $1.33 to $31.90 and Merck climbed $2.42 to
$52.91.</TE>
<TE>   But health insurer Cigna reminded investors that corporate
earnings remain a decidedly mixed bag:</TE>
<TE>   After slashing profit estimates for this year and next, the
company saw its shares plummet $24.21 to $39.39 -- a 38% drop.</TE>
<TE>   In commodity trading, crude oil fell $1.15 to $27.05 a barrel in
New York as talks at the United Nations eased fears of a U.S.-Iraq
war. Expectations that U.S. inventories will swell also depressed
prices.</TE>
<TE>   Among oil-related stocks, Noble sank $3.61 to $31.45 and Amerada
Hess slumped $5.63 to $52.14 as brokerages downgraded those shares.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * American Electric Power soared $2.78 to $24.65 after the utility
giant said profit rose slightly as increased electricity sales
overcame an energy-trading slump.</TE>
<TE>   * Starbucks rose $1.48 to $23.93 after the coffee chain raised its
estimate for full-year earnings to 54 cents a share from 53 cents.</TE>
<TE>   * Household International gained $1.26 to $24.09 after the
consumer finance company raised $900 million in two securities
offerings.</TE>

<LD>Carnival Corp. agreed to buy P&amp;O Princess Cruises Ltd. for $7.3
billion in stock and assumed debt, extending its lead as the largest
cruise line operator and capping an almost yearlong, three-way battle
for the British company.</LD>
<LD>   In buying P&amp;O Princess, Miami-based Carnival tops hometown rival
Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., the No. 2 cruise line company, gaining
more ships offering mid-priced vacations to complement its lower-end
Carnival Cruise ships and upscale Holland America line.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of Carnival rose $1.67 to $27.33 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</LD>

<LD>Longshore union officials denied they were violating court orders by
orchestrating slowdowns at West Coast docks, and told the Justice
Department that the blame for continuing backlogs of cargo lies with
the shipping lines.</LD>
<LD>   "The fact is our workers are ready, willing and able to work,"
said James Spinosa, president of the International Longshore and
Warehouse Union, which has been in contract talks with the Pacific
Maritime Assn., representing the shipping industry.</LD>
<LD>   The union said any alleged slowdowns could be explained by
congestion on the docks and shortages of equipment and labor.</LD>
<TE>   An industry spokesman said the PMA submitted detailed charts
documenting slowdowns "terminal by terminal and shift by shift."</TE>

<LD>Durable-goods orders plunged 5.9% in September, pulled down by weak
demand for cars and aircraft equipment, the Commerce Department said.</LD>
<LD>   A second report, by the University of Michigan, found that the
consumer sentiment index fell to 80.6 from 86.1 in September, more
than expected. The two closely watched reports bolster chances that
the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next week.</LD>
<LD>   Home buyers continued to provide the one ray of sunshine in an
otherwise uncertain economic outlook. The Commerce Department said
sales of new U.S. homes climbed 0.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 1.02 million units last month. Meanwhile, Realtor groups said
existing-home sales in September rose 1.9% nationally and 3.6% in
California.</LD>

<LD>Orange County's manufacturing sector contracted unexpectedly in the
third quarter, weighed down by slumping durable-goods industries and
an ailing high-tech sector, according to a survey of Orange County
purchasing managers.</LD>
<LD>   Chapman University's quarterly index of purchasing managers
declined to 43.7 in the third quarter from 49.9 in the second
quarter. A value below 50 indicates activity is contracting.</LD>
<LD>   Chapman economist Raymond Sfeir said the county's hard-hit
high-technology sector continues to weigh down the index. Purchasing
managers said new orders for computer equipment sagged in the third
quarter, reflecting continued reluctance by firms to invest in
equipment.</LD>

the sharp falloff after last year's terrorist attacks.</TE>

<LD>After just three months, Tracy Wood has stepped down from her post as
editor-in-chief of Ms. magazine. Wood will oversee investigative
reporting at the feminist publication, a post she says is a far
better fit.</LD>
<LD>   Wood was named editor in July to great fanfare, and hailed as a
leader who could take the magazine back to its hard-hitting roots,
breaking news from the feminist perspective.</LD>
<LD>   Wood is a former investigative journalist for the Los Angeles
Times and the Orange County Register. She had no experience putting
out a magazine.</LD>
<TE>   The October issue was to have been the first under her
stewardship. There was no October issue. No new editor in chief has
been named, Wood said.</TE>

<HD>Appeals Court Rejects 2 Cities' ATM Fees Ban</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court rejected a bid by Santa Monica and San
Francisco to reinstate a ban on fees charged to people who use
automated teller machines at banks where they don't hold an account.</LD>
<LD>   The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling that
the cities violated federal banking law in fall 1999 by trying to bar
the ATM fees, typically $1.50 per transaction. In the fall of 1999,
the cities became the first in the U.S. to try to ban such fees,
calling them exorbitant and unfair to the elderly and disabled. But
Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and the California Bankers
Assn. sued, saying that the cities lack jurisdiction and that ATMs,
designed as a benefit for customers, are costly to operate.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco plans to petition for a rehearing before the full
9th Circuit, and Santa Monica is considering its next move, spokesmen
said.</LD>

<HD>SEC's Choice to Lead Board Draws Anger</HD>
<DH>After 3-2 vote in favor of William Webster to lead the
accounting panel, co-author of reform legislation calls for Pitt's
resignation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jube Shiver Jr. and Walter Hamilton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday picked former FBI
Director William H. Webster to head a new accounting oversight panel
in a partisan vote that symbolized how politically charged accounting
reform has become in the current climate of financial scandal.</LD>
<LD>   In a 3-2 vote, SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt and two other
Republican commissioners chose Webster and four other candidates --
including former California pension official Kayla J. Gillan -- over
more than 450 applicants to serve on the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board.</LD>
<LD>   The vote came at the end of an hourlong meeting marked by acrimony
and impassioned speeches on both sides.</LD>
<TE>   The decision left SEC Commissioners Harvey Goldschmid and Roel
Campos -- both Democrats -- disappointed because they had favored
John H. Biggs, a New York pension fund executive with a reputation
for backing tough new regulations for the accounting industry.</TE>
<TE>   But Webster, a onetime federal judge and a longtime Republican,
prevailed after Pitt and Republican SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins
promoted the former FBI and CIA director as the ideal candidate to
restore investor confidence in a scandal-plagued accounting industry.</TE>
<TE>   "The accounting agency needs a tough cop," said Atkins, citing
Webster's law enforcement background. Webster is "a dream candidate
to be the George Washington of this accounting board."</TE>
<TE>   Others chosen Friday to serve on the oversight board were Gillan,
former chief counsel with the California Public Employees' Retirement
System; former SEC general counsel Daniel L. Goelzer; former U.S.
Rep. Willis D. Gradison Jr. of Ohio; and Charles D. Niemeier, chief
accountant in the SEC's enforcement division.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting oversight board was created by the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, a sweeping overhaul of accounting and securities rules that
President Bush signed in July. The board will oversee standards used
by public accountants and discipline accountants who violate
securities laws.</TE>
<TE>   The rancor over Webster's appointment comes as investors and
policymakers are looking to the SEC to restore confidence in
corporate bookkeeping. A wave of accounting scandals began last year
when evidence surfaced that energy trader Enron Corp. used
off-the-books partnerships and questionable accounting practices to
hide its deteriorating financial condition. Enron's main auditor --
accounting firm Arthur Andersen -- was convicted in June of
obstruction of justice for shredding Enron financial documents.</TE>
<TE>   Campos said the rejection of Biggs underscores the perception that
the SEC remains too closely aligned with the interests of the
accounting industry, which had lobbied for Webster. He predicted that
the board would face a legal challenge from disgruntled reform
advocates, hampering the board's effectiveness. Others discounted
that possibility, however.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt made an emotional defense of his choice of Webster, saying he
was not pressured by the accounting industry to back the former FBI
director.</TE>
<TE>   "I am fiercely independent. I am beholden to no one," Pitt said.</TE>
<TE>   No one from the accounting profession, the Republican Party or the
Bush administration had sought to influence his judgment, Pitt said.</TE>
<TE>   Webster, a partner in a Washington law firm, could not be reached
Friday. In a statement, Biggs said Webster, despite not having an
accounting background, "is accustomed to moving into complex new
worlds and finding his way immediately."</TE>
<TE>   Webster's selection drew a mixed reaction on Capitol Hill, where
he will have to mend political fences.</TE>
<TE>   Echoing the comments of many of his fellow Republicans, Sen. Phil
Gramm of Texas called the SEC's new accounting panel "a quality
board, which all objective observers will find acceptable.... For
someone to criticize Chairman Pitt for not nominating their choice of
chairman, or members, over the choice of the majority of the
commission seems to me unfair and wholly political."</TE>
<TE>   But Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), co-sponsor of the
Sarbanes-Oxley legislation, criticized Webster's appointment and
called on Pitt to resign.</TE>
<TE>   Sarbanes said Pitt was "appearing to bow to political and industry
pressures" by not choosing Biggs, the head of pension fund TIAA-CREF.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Seeks More Investors in Parks</HD>
<DH>Firm needs cash to pare debt from media-related
acquisitions and fund theme park expansion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Verrier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal has stepped up efforts to court investors for its
marquee theme park business, as the media giant finds itself under
continuing pressure to raise cash.</LD>
<LD>   Universal executives have been in talks with private equity groups
about investing in the theme parks or expanding their existing
stakes, according to sources familiar with the discussions. An
infusion of cash from new investors would do two things for Vivendi:
help cut the company's $19-billion media- related debt and fund an
ex- pansion of the capital-intensive theme park business.</LD>
<LD>   Emerging as the leading suitor is Blackstone Group, a private
equity investment firm in New York that wants to expand its stake in
Universal's theme park business, the sources said. It already owns a
50% share of Universal's two theme parks in Orlando, Fla. Universal
also operates parks in Universal City, Spain and Japan.</LD>
<TE>   Blackstone representatives reportedly have been talking to
Universal executives for weeks and recently returned from a visit to
Universal's newest theme park, in Osaka, Japan. Executives from
Blackstone and Vivendi declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The talks come as Vivendi Universal faces pressure to raise nearly
$12 billion from selling assets. Efforts by new Chief Executive
Jean-Rene Fourtou have been hampered by a poor business environment
worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   The latest setback came Friday, when Vivendi was forced to delay
the sale of U.S. publishing house Houghton Mifflin because offers
have fallen far short of expectations. Without the extra cash,
Fourtou could have a tough time waging a possible bidding war with
Britain's Vodafone for control of Cegetel, a profitable French
telecom business.</TE>
<TE>   Theme parks, although hit hard by an industrywide slump since the
terrorist attacks, have been a profitable business for Vivendi. They
contribute more than $300 million a year in cash flow and are worth
$2 billion to $4 billion, according to analysts' estimates.</TE>
<TE>   It's unknown what arrangement Vivendi may agree to, but sources
say any deal is not expected to involve an outright sale. The parks,
well regarded in the industry, are seen as a growth business by
Vivendi Universal Entertainment Chairman Barry Diller and Universal
Studios President Ron Meyer.</TE>
<TE>   In a vote of confidence in the business earlier this year, Vivendi
agreed to develop three major new attractions at its theme parks in
Universal City and Orlando next year.</TE>
<TE>   By courting more outside investment, Vivendi is seeking to limit
its exposure to the business while raising cash that would finance
expansion. Like industry leader Walt Disney Co., Universal has been
aggressively scouting for sites for a possible theme park in China --
considered the next frontier in an industry that has matured in the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   For investors such as Blackstone, which has been a long- time
investor in the theme park industry, it is considered a good time to
increase investments because values are depressed.</TE>
<TE>   "These are good, well-managed properties," said industry
consultant Bill Coan of Orlando. "I think the selling point is that
they've gone through the bad times. There is a great value for these
properties."</TE>
<TE>   Other entertainment companies have found ways to retain ties to
theme parks without taking on the costs and risks of managing them.
Time Warner, for example, sold its Six Flags parks years ago but
still receives a licensing fee for use of its characters and brands.</TE>
<TE>   One of Disney's most successful theme parks, Tokyo Disneyland, is
fully owned and operated by a Japanese company, which pays Disney a
licensing fee.</TE>
<TE>   Universal, however, is not considering a similar licensing model
but favors its pattern of recent years of seeking third parties to
defray costs.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Universal Studios owns 24% of Universal Studios Japan
and has a lucrative management deal but invested only about $90
million in the $1.7-billion facility. The remainder of the park is
owned by investors and the city of Osaka.</TE>
<TE>   Universal also operates Universal Mediterranea, a resort near
Barcelona, Spain, that this year added a second 500-room hotel as
well as a water park to the existing Port Aventura theme park.
Universal has a 37% stake in the project; other owners include
Spanish bank La Caixa (which owns 40%) and Anheuser-Busch Cos. (16%).</TE>

<LD>The score: 16-4, the Wicked Forces of the North besting the Angels of
the South.</LD>
<LD>   The scene: The aftermath of the most dispiriting and embarrassing
defeat in the history of a long-suffering franchise.</LD>
<LD>   My mission: To restore my faith. To share the loneliness of a
possible World Series loss.</LD>
<TE>   To step back from the brink.</TE>
<TE>   To find the truest of fans.</TE>
<TE>   First, the search:</TE>
<TE>   10 p.m., Thursday night. After my 10-minute postgame cry, I call
Russ Frazier, who is in charge of membership for the Anaheim Angels
Booster Club. He says there might be fans at the airport to greet the
team and perhaps some at Edison Field, where the Angels must return
to pick up their cars.</TE>
<TE>   "But after a late night and a game like this," Frazier says, "I'm
not sure if you'll find anyone."</TE>
<TE>   10:20 p.m. Put on red shirt and AL champs cap. Tell the wife not
to wait up. Depart Hollywood, heading east.</TE>
<TE>   11:05 p.m. Talk by cell with Larry Babcock, manager of baseball
information for the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "Come on out," he says, recalling the hundreds that turned out at
Long Beach Airport to greet the team last month after it clinched a
playoff berth in Texas.</TE>
<TE>   11:27 p.m. Two fans on a radio call-in show say they and friends
are headed to the airport to greet the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   11:32 p.m. Arrive Ontario International Airport. It is cold and
windy. No Angel fans or radio callers to be seen. Only souls there
are two photographers and a TV freelance guy looking for shots of the
team arriving.</TE>
<TE>   1:06 a.m. Team plane lands at old gate far from terminal. Still no
Angel fans, unless you count the drivers of the three team buses and
some members of the California Highway Patrol. Standing on tiptoes on
an old baggage conveyor belt, I can see Angels getting out of
aircraft. My three chants of "Let's go Angels!" draw no response.</TE>
<TE>   Photographers don't chant, maintaining their professionalism.</TE>
<TE>   1:22 a.m. Disappointed, I chase the Angel caravan down the Orange
Freeway to Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   1:48 a.m. The three team buses pull into the stadium parking lot,
but security, saying the stadium is on "lockdown" for the World
Series, does not allow me to follow.</TE>
<TE>   2:12 a.m. Park car on State College Boulevard. Begin walking
perimeter of the Edison Field property in search of fans.</TE>
<TE>   2:26 a.m. Fans!</TE>
<TE>   There appear to be two of them.</TE>
<TE>   Under a street light, the men sit in folding chairs they've set up
on a sidewalk on the edge of the stadium parking lot. A player's car
passes, and they nod.</TE>
<TE>   "Scott Spiezio, I think," one says.</TE>
<TE>   The first man has a white beard that gives him a wise and regal
look. He is Thomas Byrd, 45; grew up in Anaheim. When he was a child,
his grandparents brought him to the groundbreaking of the stadium
standing behind him. He's still drawn to it.</TE>
<TE>   He arrived shortly after the game, and stayed to see the team
buses come back. He'll spend the night on the sidewalk and see if the
Angels have a few extra Game 6 or 7 tickets to sell in the morning.
He owns a painting company, he says, but business is slow now.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got quite a bit of free time and a nice little nest egg," he
says. "And I'm putting it all into the Angels."</TE>
<TE>   Next to Byrd sits a young father. James Webb is 25. He's been out
of work, he says, since being laid off from a furniture factory
shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks. He consoles himself with the
Angels, a team he has followed since he was a 5-year-old living in
Garden Grove and his favorite player was Reggie Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to walk up there and get some autographs," Webb
explains, pointing to the part of the parking lot where players are
getting into their cars and driving off. "But I have him with me."</TE>
<TE>   Who?</TE>
<TE>   And suddenly there he is.</TE>
<TE>   Swaddled in a blanket with wrestling logos and lying asleep in
Webb's arms is a little boy. "His mother doesn't like that we're out
here in the middle of the night," Webb says. "But he said he wanted
to come."</TE>
<TE>   Jaydyn Webb is 3 years old.</TE>
<TE>   He is wearing an Angels shirt and a red stocking cap. When he's
awake, Webb's son is never without a stick and ball.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a special one," his father says.</TE>
<TE>   "Jaydyn loves the Angels whether they win or lose."</TE>
<TE>   4:17 a.m. Return home. Wife, half asleep, asks: How'd it go?</TE>
<TE>   Fine, I say.</TE>
<TE>   Sleep will come easily now.</TE>
<TE>   There is hope.</TE>

<HD>Deputy D.A. Resigns Over Arco Gas Case</HD>
<DH>O.C. prosecutor said she had clashed with Rackauckas over
the settlement phase of contamination suit against the oil company.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stuart Pfeifer and Seema Mehta</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A prosecutor known for her aggressive enforcement of environmental
laws said Friday that she had resigned after repeated clashes with
Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas regarding an environmental
contamination case against the Atlantic Richfield Co.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County sued the giant oil company in 2000 to force it to
clean up contamination from leaking underground gasoline tanks at
dozens of the company's service stations in the county.</LD>
<LD>   The case focused on the additive MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl
ether), a possible carcinogen that officials say flowed along with
the leaking gasoline dangerously close to the county's drinking water
aquifer.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors and an Arco spokesman disclosed Friday that officials
have tentatively settled part of the case, which is considered one of
the nation's most important MTBE prosecutions.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say a significant verdict or settlement figure -- Arco
faces potential civil penalties in the tens of millions -- could
influence cases across the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Michelle Lyman, who filed the case and managed
it for more than two years, said she resigned after being excluded
from settlement negotiations, which were taken over by Rackauckas and
a private law firm he hired. Lyman's departure is the latest in a
series of personnel shake-ups at the district attorney's office
during Rackauckas' four years in office. Rackauckas declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California environmental enforcement officers said they
were disappointed to hear Lyman is leaving; she is considered one of
the region's most effective environmental prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a pit bull for the Orange County D.A.'s environmental
section. ... She forced a lot of quick settlements," said Ken
Williams, a chief underground storage tank enforcement officer for
the California Regional Water Quality Control Board. "We hope someone
with as much conviction for the environment is going to be there to
replace her."</TE>
<TE>   Lyman said she is joining a new state agency that will send
experienced attorneys to help enforce environmental laws in rural
California counties.Karen Hodel, manager of the hazardous materials
mitigation unit for the Orange County Health Care Agency, said she
considers Lyman's departure a loss for the county.</TE>
<TE>   "My unit worked closely with her on several cases. She always
demonstrated a real desire to work on environmental protection
issues. We're going to miss her," Hodel said.</TE>
<TE>   In June, the Orange County Grand Jury issued a report critical of
the way Rackauckas ran the office.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, the grand jury faulted Rackauckas for taking
over a consumer protection lawsuit against apartment developer George
Argyros and removing a veteran prosecutor from the case. It
recommended that Rackauckas allow prosecutors in highly specialized
cases to participate in all settlement discussions.</TE>
<TE>   Lyman, an environmental prosecutor for 12 years who specializes in
gasoline storage contamination cases, said Rackauckas had prohibited
her from participating in settlement negotiations with Arco for at
least six months.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Rackauckas is handling negotiations along with a law firm
he hired to work on the case, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas hired the Newport Beach firm Robinson, Calgagnie and
Robinson to help prosecute the Arco case. The firm's three main
partners contributed a combined $3,000 to Rackauckas' campaign in
June 2001, records show.</TE>
<TE>   "Tony and the private lawyer, Mark Robinson, have been personally
participating in settlement talks," Lyman said. "Everybody is there
except the two line prosecutors most knowledgeable about the case,
Aleta Bryant and myself. We are the two who understand the facts and
the law better than anyone."</TE>
<TE>   Lyman said she respects the work of Robinson's firm but believes
line prosecutors should have played a more significant role in the
case.</TE>
<TE>   The new criticism comes one week after state Atty. Gen. Bill
Lockyer sent Rackauckas a four-page letter that accused him of
inadequately responding to the grand jury's recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas has maintained that the grand jury report is full of
inaccuracies and denies any wrongdoing. He said the report was
influenced by critics unhappy about his efforts to reform the office.</TE>
<TE>   Lyman is one of at least 23 deputy prosecutors who have left the
district attorney's office since Rackauckas took office in January
1999.</TE>
<TE>   "We've lost a tremendous amount of talent and experience during
these last four years," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher Kralick,
head of the union that represents Orange County prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Arco's parent, BP, is the largest producer of oil and gasoline in
the United States. Arco operates more than 100 gas stations in Orange
County; at least 60 of them are contaminated, prosecutors alleged.</TE>
<TE>   The tentative agreement calls for Arco to pay to test soil beneath
the company's gas stations in Orange County to see if MTBE
contamination exists, officials said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides still need to agree on a cleanup plan and any civil
penalties that Arco would pay. Joe D'Agostino, who heads the district
attorney's environmental crimes unit, said he is optimistic that the
sides will reach an agreement within a month.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County has similar suits pending against Thrifty Oil Co.,
Shell Oil Co. and Lyondell Chemical Co., which would not be affected
by a settlement with Arco.</TE>
<TE>   MTBE was added to gasoline more than two decades ago to reduce air
pollution, and its use became widespread in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Further study found that MTBE is a suspected carcinogen that
spreads quickly through the soil and ground water, and that even in
small amounts it can make drinking water smell like turpentine.</TE>

<HD>New Chief Comes In Swinging</HD>
<DH>Bratton takes oath, then condemns LAPD's current state and
vows 'extraordinarily sweeping' change. Hahn says he'll back him up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Beth Shuster and Richard Winton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William J. Bratton formally became the chief of the LAPD on Friday,
and quickly stepped up his criticism of the department he now
commands, while Mayor James K. Hahn said he intends to give the new
chief wide latitude to revamp the organization.</LD>
<LD>   Bratton took the oath of office in a swift private ceremony in
Hahn's City Hall office early Friday, then jumped aboard a helicopter
with the mayor to attend a city emergency preparedness conference in
Lake Arrowhead. When they arrived, the former New York City police
commissioner brusquely critiqued the LAPD's management structure and
policing strategies.</LD>
<LD>   "There's an enormous amount that can be done here, an enormous
amount that needs to be done," Bratton said. Among his concerns: "The
organizational chart currently makes no sense ....[It] looks like it
was put together by three blind men.... The department is not
strategically engaged in fighting crime.... We have 9,000 officers
smiling and waving as they drive around in their cars."</LD>
<TE>   He said he expects to make "extraordinarily sweeping" changes.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, who rejected former Chief Bernard C. Parks' bid for a second
term and who selected Bratton as a replacement, said he supports the
new chief's commitment to overhauling the Police Department and will
let him make the changes he believes are necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "I have complete confidence in Bill Bratton," the mayor said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he is concerned about any of the potential changes in the
department, Hahn quickly responded: "I'm worried if we don't change."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, the mayor said he is working to help Bratton find
money in the budget to hire consultants to examine specific areas of
the department to develop new proposals. Bratton said he has asked
four people to help him with ideas.</TE>
<TE>   One is George Kelling, who, along with James Q. Wilson, helped
develop the "broken windows" theory of policing that argues for early
police intervention on small problems in order to head off more
serious crime in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton said he has also asked Bob Wasserman, who worked with him
in New York, to help with the transition. Bill Andrews -- who has
previously helped Bratton write speeches, articles and internal
communications -- also will advise the new administration. And John
Linder, who also worked with Bratton in the New York Police
Department, will assist with expanding the LAPD's computerized
crime-fighting efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton was sworn in by J. Michael Carey, the city clerk, standing
in front of the mayor; Police Commission President Rick Caruso; Cmdr.
Sharon Papa; Cmdr. Jim McDonnell; and interim Chief Martin Pomeroy.
Bratton then signed several documents making his tenure as the 54th
police chief official. He joked as he was handed a second batch of
signature pages, "Is this for the $44 payment to park in the garage?"</TE>
<TE>   "It's official," Papa said a few seconds later, and he gave her a
double thumbs-up.</TE>
<TE>   After shaking Papa's hand, Caruso said: "Good luck. Take care. The
new team. The A-team."</TE>
<TE>   When he emerged from his swearing-in, Bratton beamed, joking with
a reporter who called him chief. "Yeah, you can officially call me
chief now."</TE>
<TE>   As they then flew to Arrowhead, Hahn pointed out several landmarks
to his newly arrived chief, who smiled broadly for most of the trip.
At one point, when the helicopter flew above the clouds just as the
sun began to shine, he said: "Pinch me."</TE>
<TE>   A public swearing-in ceremony for Bratton will take place at 11
a.m. Monday on the training field at the Los Angeles Police Academy
in Elysian Park.</TE>
<TE>   McDonnell is heading Bratton's transition team, and Papa is
expected to secure an important position in the new police
administration. Other officers are awaiting word of their fates.</TE>
<TE>   McDonnell recently directed all 114 captains, commanders and
chiefs to submit their resumes, photos, accomplishments and plans for
the future for Bratton's review.</TE>
<TE>   "I have 339 ideas," Bratton said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that he is interviewing several of those officials in the
upper echelon of the department before making any final decisions on
his command staff. He noted that Civil Service rules limit his
ability to remove someone immediately. Still, he said he expects to
name three assistant chiefs and other deputy chiefs as well to form
what he called "a new, energized command staff."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton said he expects the full cooperation of the rank and file.
After all, he said, the mayor has supported the police union this
year, in particular by agreeing to a more flexible work schedule for
officers. Now, Bratton said, the union needs to "step up to that."</TE>
<TE>   He was blunt about his expectations: "There will be no resistance.
If there is resistance, they'll be gone. There's no room for
resistance in the LAPD."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Bratton said he wants police officers to be aggressive in
their duties.</TE>
<TE>   "A ship in a safe harbor is not what a ship was meant to do,"
Bratton said. "A cop riding around in a car ... is not what a cop is
meant to do."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said he expects to support whatever plans Bratton has for
reorganizing the department.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said the Rampart corruption scandal, which involved
members of that LAPD division's anti-gang Community Resources Against
Street Hoodlums squad, led the department to "throw the baby out with
the bathwater" by killing the units.</TE>
<TE>   "I want us to really get serious and focused and organized about
the gang crime problem in the city," Hahn said. "I am not happy about
the level of safety in many of the communities in Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   In his continuing introduction of his new chief, the mayor expects
to attend several events around the city with Bratton next week.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton's first official day on the job also marked the last for
acting Chief Pomeroy.</TE>
<TE>   As he prepared to leave, officers and others in Parker Center
downtown lined the hallways to the parking lot to bid him farewell.
Pomeroy, a popular veteran of the LAPD, came out of retirement to
lead the department during the search for the chief, and his
departure was a sad event for many of his longtime colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   Those in the halls Friday afternoon included the department's
highest officials, as well as rank-and-file members and civilians. It
was the first such farewell since former Chief Daryl Gates'
departure, according to several Parker Center officers.</TE>

<HD>Buddhist Temple to Open in Irvine With the Glow of a
Thriving Faith</HD>
<DH>Today's ceremonies at the spacious, $5-million Pao Fa
represent a landmark in the region's religious diversity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Lobdell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just a few feet from Southern California's newest Buddhist temple, a
six-lane boulevard carries harried business commuters in Irvine past
a blur of low-rise industrial buildings. The temple's Far East
architecture is intriguing enough to motorists that they stop in and
ask: When does this Japanese restaurant open?</LD>
<LD>   The confusion is understandable. No one in these parts has ever
seen anything like the $5-million Pao Fa Buddhist Temple, Orange
County's first mega-temple. It's 41,000 square feet of prayer halls,
8-ton jade Buddhas, classrooms, a library, dining hall and 42-room
monastery.</LD>
<LD>   And this morning, after nearly five years of construction, an
expected crowd of 3,000 will get the first public peek inside during
an open ceremony that mixes elements of the East and West with the
consecration of the Buddhas, recitation of sacred readings, and the
singing of "The Star Spangled Banner."</LD>
<TE>   "We don't have a big temple like this from Orange County down to
San Diego," said May Wen, chair of the South Coast Chinese Cultural
Assn., an Irvine-based group devoted to educating immigrants and
their children. "This temple will touch a lot of people."</TE>
<TE>   Even in the days leading up to its opening, the mood within the
temple has been established. In the main prayer hall, wisps of smoke
from incense ascend to the 4,000 golden Buddhas lining three upper
walls of the enormous sanctuary. On the 71-foot-long wooden altar
near the far wall sit three 8-ton statues, carved from solid white
jade.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty monks, nuns and volunteers kneel for their evening prayers
-- chanting in ancient cadences punctuated by a drum, bell and gong
for more than an hour. Though work crews still hammer, saw and drill
here and there, life inside the largest Buddhist temple in Orange
County already reflects the serene countenance of its abbot and
founder, Venerable Master Jen-Yi.</TE>
<TE>   "The secret is to not have too many expectations," said Jen-Yi, a
66-year-old Buddhist monk who was born in Taiwan and speaks through a
translator. "We knew we were going to have obstacles going in."</TE>
<TE>   Delays in construction were caused by Jen-Yi's extensive travel to
two sister temples in Taiwan that slowed decisions and also by
problems generated when temple designs didn't match with city
building codes. Jen-Yi said the $5 million raised for the
construction and $1 million spent acquiring the 3.2-acre lot in 1995
came from members of the two temples in Taiwan he helped to start.</TE>
<TE>   The Pao Fa temple is a significant addition to Orange County's
religious landscape, another acknowledgment of the maturing of a
diversity of faiths that in recent years has spawned plans for a new
Roman Catholic cathedral, a large mosque and Muslim community center,
a Mormon temple and a $65-million Jewish community center.</TE>
<TE>   "I get a sense of a new Buddhism emerging in America" that is
becoming more integrated into the general community, said Benjamin J.
Hubbard, chairman of the comparative religion department at Cal State
Fullerton. "There's a desire of Buddhists to put a [public] face on
their faith, and now's a good time with religious pluralism no longer
the exception and religious tolerance quite high."</TE>
<TE>   For many Orange County Buddhists, especially those reared on the
Chinese-influenced version of the faith, it means the end to long
commutes to large temples in Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Frank Yow, a retired chemist who lives in Laguna Niguel, often
drove to temples in Monrovia or Hacienda Heights for a day of
meditation. But he has found the Pao Fa temple to be a perfect place
to calm his mind.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter what, you get a cool feeling by stepping inside," Yow
said. "You cool down your body and your mind."</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County mega-temple is not related to another large
temple in Hacienda Heights that's also run by Taiwanese monks and
nuns. The Hsi Lai Temple is called the largest Buddhist temple in the
Western hemisphere. The $10-million, 60,000-square-foot building sits
on 14 acres of hillside property.</TE>
<TE>   "In my opinion the size of the place is not that important," Yow
said. "It's the people in charge. And [Jen-Yi], I saw him several
times, and he's very friendly and approachable."</TE>
<TE>   Orange County, with its large Asian immigrant communities, is home
to many smaller temples, most reflecting how the Buddhist faith is
practiced in the homelands of their members. Among the largest and
oldest is the 900-member Orange County Buddhist Church in Anaheim, a
temple founded in 1965 by Japanese immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   The Pao Fa temple reflects a form of Mahayana Buddhism, one of the
main branches of the faith. The goal of Buddhism is to end personal
suffering and the suffering of others through discipline,  meditation
and wisdom.</TE>
<TE>   At the temple, both the monks and the nuns are celibate, shave
their heads, wear brown robes and eat vegetarian meals. They live
simply: no television, radio, or Internet. Their tiny spartan rooms
hold a straw sleeping mat and a small chest of drawers. Currently,
two monks and a dozen nuns live at the Irvine temple.</TE>
<TE>   Also staying at the temple are visiting monks who have traveled
from throughout California and Taiwan to help prepare for the grand
opening. In a small room at the temple, 82-year-old Ru Hsin Liu, a
Buddhist monk and calligrapher flown in from Taiwan, writes prayer
requests in Chinese on slips of paper that will hang in one of the
three prayer halls.</TE>
<TE>   Jen-Yi, eager to show how the temple will integrate into the
American community, holds up one of the prayer slips completed by the
monk.</TE>
<TE>   Said his translator, Chao L. Liang: "He wants you to see this is
special prayer for all those who died on Sept. 11. These souls will
be prayed for."</TE>

<HD>Davis Revives Ad Attacking Simon</HD>
<DH>An aide says the governor broke his vow to run only
positive ads because Simon has aired negative spots. Simon says Davis
is worried.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Matea Gold</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A week after yanking all his television commercials attacking
Republican gubernatorial nominee Bill Simon Jr., Gov. Gray Davis
quietly began rerunning an ad Friday that criticizes Simon's service
on the board of a failed savings and loan.</LD>
<LD>   Davis political strategist Garry South said last week that the
governor would run only positive commercials for the rest of the
campaign because he was confident in his lead over Simon, who has
stumbled repeatedly since the Republican primary.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, Simon's campaign officials seized on their opponent's
return to negative advertising as evidence that Davis' upbeat tactic
had failed.</LD>
<TE>   It "backfired on him, so he's gone back to what he tried earlier,
which is attacking," said Simon senior strategist Ed Rollins.</TE>
<TE>   But South said the governor remains confident of victory, and he
disputed suggestions that the margin between the two was shrinking.
He noted that the Davis campaign is still running two positive spots.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis campaign put a negative commercial back on the air in
response to several recent Simon ads attacking the governor's
fund-raising and handling of the state's energy crisis, South said.</TE>
<TE>   "We will stay mostly positive, but we're not going to let this guy
smack us around without reminding voters of who he is," South said,
adding: "You have to do everything in a campaign within your power to
protect your lead."</TE>
<TE>   Simon said Davis' return to negative ads demonstrated his
inability to win with positive advertising.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, Mr. Davis is worried he's going to lose, and he should
be," Simon told reporters after addressing the state National Assn.
for the Advancement of Colored People convention in Burbank Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Simon visited three classrooms at Harbor Summit
Elementary School in downtown San Diego, which serves homeless
children in an industrial neighborhood just south of the city's
glistening high-rises.</TE>
<TE>   The candidate quizzed the students about their Halloween costumes
and favorite candy, and told them he planned to dress as a vampire
and escort his children trick-or-treating in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Simon told reporters that, if elected, he would create
more schools like Harbor Summit by giving campuses more control and
developing public-private partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   "Education is going to be very important in a Simon
administration, and I believe education is one area where Mr. Davis
has fallen down," he said, standing at the edge of a playground full
of squealing 5- and 6-year-olds. "We have not made the kind of
progress that we should have made."</TE>
<TE>   South said the governor has made steady progress in improving
California's schools.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is going to believe [Simon] is going to be better on
education," he said.</TE>
<TE>   During his speech to the NAACP, Simon promised that he would
improve the school system and create more jobs. He charged the
governor with taking black voters for granted.</TE>
<TE>   "Are African American children really getting a better education
in our public schools than they were four years ago?" Simon asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you have faith in our elected leaders to look out for your
interests rather than just for those of big-name campaign
contributors?"</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, who addressed the audience of 100 people
after Simon, said the Republican candidate would not fight for issues
important to blacks.</TE>
<TE>   "He says he's a proud conservative, and he is," Bustamante said.
"If you like Newt, Ronnie and Pete, you're going to love Bill."</TE>
<TE>   Also on Friday, the former head of a police organization pictured
giving a check to Davis in a 1998 photo sued Simon for claiming that
the exchange happened in the lieutenant governor's office. That
turned out to be false, and Simon expressed regret about the
incident.</TE>
<TE>   But Al Angele, the onetime head of the California Organization of
Police and Sheriffs, said he never received a letter of apology Simon
said he sent him. Angele, a Davis appointee to the Board of Prison
Terms, filed a $100-million defamation suit against the candidate,
claiming the false charge has caused him emotional distress.</TE>
<TE>   Simon attorney Neil Shapiro dismissed the suit as baseless, saying
the GOP candidate didn't know the charge was untrue when he made it.
Shapiro said he expects the suit to be thrown out.</TE>
<TE>   Simon himself called the lawsuit "a political stunt engineered by
the Davis campaign."</TE>

<HD>Water Beds for Cattle? These Cows Milk It for All It's
Worth</HD>
<DH>The bovines are more comfortable, which makes them better
milk producers, farmers say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mira Tweti</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a beautiful end-of-summer day on George te Velde's sprawling
dairy farm in Escalon in California's Central Valley. Fresh from
milking, a small herd of Te Velde's cows is making its way back to
the stalls. One large Holstein heads for a water bed and happily lies
down. She adjusts, moving more on her side, tucking her feet under to
get situated just right. Ah, she seems to say, that's perfect, as she
floats comfortably and begins chewing her cud.</LD>
<LD>   George te Velde, a third-generation dairyman, bought 182 water
beds about a year ago as an experiment. He still has to keep big
hills of almond shells and dried manure on his property for the rest
of his 2,300 stalls. He has 2,500 cows. "You have to keep their beds
level, without holes or pits," he said, "because cows don't like
lumpy beds any more than people do." But, as cows lie on their beds
all day, they make indentations, so the beds constantly have to be
raked flat. With the water beds, he said, there are no lumps and no
need for raking.</LD>
<LD>   Te Velde said he was amazed during a recent heat wave that the
cows that had water beds were so comfortable they stayed on them,
instead of going out into the corral as the rest of the herd did.</LD>
<TE>   A dairy cow should spend a lot of its day lying down, at least
five to six hours after every meal, to ruminate well. If you're a
dairy farmer, the last thing you want to see is your cows standing
around too long, Te Velde said. Standing cows are not happy cows. If
they're forced to stand because their beds aren't comfortable, they
become stressed. Cows don't handle stress well. They lose weight, get
sore feet and produce less milk. "The cow is very complicated. If
they're not happy, their attention is going to aggravation, not milk
production," said Gerard Niessink, Western sales representative of
GNE Farm Equipment, which makes cow water beds.</TE>
<TE>   About 30,000 cow water beds have been sold in America in the last
four years, since they were introduced from England. There are 4,000
in California, where dairy farmers report that when cows have a
choice of sleeping arrangements, they will push each other out of the
way to get to the water beds.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesotan Al Peters was one of the first American dairymen to
purchase water beds for his cows. Peters said cows are like people.
He regards a few of his 150 cows as companions with whom he can
converse. Peters said cow comfort is all cows talk about. "If a cow
stands in the walkway and she doesn't lay down a lot, she's telling
you that her stall is not comfy."</TE>
<TE>   Peters' cows took a week to get used to the first 18 water beds he
installed. Then they filled up and haven't been empty since. "The
first year we had them, the cows were standing behind each other
trying to go lay down on them," he said. Peters now has 104 water
beds, each expected to have a 10- to 15-year lifespan. He said the
only maintenance is adding antifreeze or windshield-wiper fluid to
keep them from freezing in the Minnesota winter.</TE>
<TE>   Before Peters bought his first water beds, he tried a flat
mattress, but in five years it got hard as a rock, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, if me and you laid out on the highway every night, we
wouldn't wake up feeling too peppy. It's the same way with cows," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   For the softest cow bedding, dairymen traditionally have used
composted manure, straw, sawdust, shells, sand or a combination.
Besides requiring a lot of maintenance, conventional bedding, if it
gets wet or hard from use, can cause health problems for the cows,
such as mastitis.</TE>
<TE>   Cows that lie on hard surfaces can develop sores on their elbows
the size of baseballs. "If you ever watch a cow lay down, they don't
actually lay down, they fall down," said Dinuba, Calif., dairyman
Gerrit Griffioen. "Basically, the easy way to tell if your beds are
soft enough is if you fall down on it on your knees and it doesn't
hurt your knees, then it's not too hard and it's not going to hurt
your cow."</TE>
<TE>   Griffioen goes out of his way to make sure his cows are
comfortable. In the summer, if it's over 80 degrees, he runs fans and
misting sprinklers to keep them cool. Griffioen doesn't have any
water beds yet, but he thinks it's a good idea. "Water beds around
here are a pretty new thing, and they are pretty expensive, but
bedding adds up too. If this water bed thing proves itself, it'll
take off," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Water beds for cows were designed 10 years ago by British aviation
tycoon Alan Bristow. Bristow was looking for a better bed for his own
herd of 400 cows in Surrey, England, and a replacement for the rubber
mattresses he'd tried, which had become hard. The thought came to him
that by putting water in the beds it would be like making them into
big hot water bottles. His cow water beds are now being used by
farmers in many parts of Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Bovine water beds don't look exactly the same as human water beds.
Because cows walk on them, and need to feel sure-footed, the beds are
slimmer, with about 17 gallons of water in each pad -- compared to 80
gallons for a deep, queen-sized, human water bed.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of a cow water bed is about $200, which includes a
concrete base to hold the mattress. At Mr. Waterbed in Fullerton,
owner Mike Abbot said prices are about $200 more for a human water
bed. He wasn't surprised that cows like water beds.</TE>
<TE>   Nor was Abbot surprised that they're holding up under cows. He had
an elephant get on one once, he said. It was a big one and it rolled
around on the bed for a while. He said everyone watching thought the
elephant was going to break the water bed, but there were just a few
holes in it from its nails.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been telling large-sized customers, complaining that the
beds won't be big enough for them, that they can hold an elephant,"
Abbot said. "And now I'm going to add that cows are sleeping on
them."</TE>

<HD>The Future Is Now in Santa Paula</HD>
<DH>Election day is looming large for the small farming
community. Residents will decide both how their town is governed and
developed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Fred Alvarez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is one of the biggest political fights ever to hit Santa Paula, a
watershed election that could shape the small farm town's future and
restore some of the glories of years past.</LD>
<LD>   On Nov. 5, voters could install a new City Council majority, open
the door to large-scale development in remote Adams Canyon and
revolutionize the city's electoral process by agreeing to carve the
mostly Latino community into five voting districts.</LD>
<LD>   But all seven candidates agree there could be even more at stake.</LD>
<TE>   They say the election is about reversing the decline of a town
once known as a thriving business and cultural center, a place where
rows of stately Victorian homes and a picturesque Main Street still
beckon Hollywood filmmakers seeking to re-create a slice of
small-town America.</TE>
<TE>   The election is also about boosting Santa Paula's sagging economy,
which is reflected in its timeworn downtown. It is about stemming a
rising tide of crime -- Santa Paula was one of the few Ventura County
cities where crime was up last year, surging nearly 13% because of
sharp increases in robbery and theft.</TE>
<TE>   And it is about smoothing tensions, largely divided along racial
lines, that resulted two years ago in a U.S. Department of Justice
lawsuit alleging that the city's at-large voting system had
perpetuated racial discrimination by preventing Latino candidates
from being elected to the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   City leaders agreed last year to a settlement that included
letting voters decide whether to elect council members by district.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Laura Flores Espinosa, a longtime advocate for ethnic
diversity in Santa Paula government and the only Latino on the City
Council when the federal lawsuit was filed, is running for reelection
as a write-in candidate because she missed a filing deadline for
council incumbents.</TE>
<TE>   Espinosa is the only one of the seven candidates who favors
district elections.</TE>
<TE>   But all the candidates agree that the city needs to rejuvenate its
downtown, build a stronger tax base and provide more housing for
residents of all incomes.</TE>
<TE>   They differ, however, on how to achieve those goals, splitting
most noticeably into two camps over Measure F, an initiative that
would change the city's growth boundary, clearing the way for
development of up to 2,250 homes and condominiums in Adams Canyon
northwest of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Incumbent Rick Cook and candidates Al Escoto and Rita Graham
support the measure, arguing that it is the best way to pull Santa
Paula out of an economic nose dive that has made it difficult to pay
police officers competitive salaries and provide recreational
activities for children.</TE>
<TE>   Espinosa and candidates Gabino Aguirre, Mary Ann Krause and John
Wisda oppose the initiative, saying the best way to jolt Santa Paula
out of economic stagnation is to invest in the city core.</TE>
<TE>   "If Measure F passes, it will totally change the character of
Santa Paula," said Aguirre, 56, a 30-year resident of the city and
principal at the continuation high school in Moorpark.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of Ventura County seems to be up for grabs
development-wise," Aguirre added. "But I don't really see that Santa
Paula needs to go that way. I think there's plenty of room for growth
within the city."</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre said that one of his first priorities would be to embark
on a citywide "visioning process," gathering opinions from residents
and community groups to create a blueprint for how Santa Paula should
look decades from now.</TE>
<TE>   He also favors creating a mix of multistory shops and housing
units in and around the city's downtown.</TE>
<TE>   "Santa Paula, just like other small towns throughout the country,
is suffering from neglect," Aguirre said. "When I look down the road,
I think we are going to be the island in a sea of development and
that island is going to attract a lot of people."</TE>
<TE>   Cook, 52, said he favors Measure F because it is the best way to
generate money needed to improve parks, public safety and other city
services. The lifelong Santa Paula resident was elected to the
council four years ago and served on the Planning Commission five
years before that.</TE>
<TE>   "If Measure F doesn't pass, Santa Paula will just stay like it is,
because we have no money," said Cook, a retired Santa Paula police
officer who now works as an investigator with the Ventura County
public defender's office.</TE>
<TE>   He notes that a yes vote on Measure F doesn't approve development
in Adams Canyon but does allow city leaders to begin considering
development options. However, he said that building in the canyon
northwest of Santa Paula could bring good jobs, lure new industry,
increase the city's tax base and cure a variety of ills.</TE>
<TE>   "The city really is at a crossroads," Cook said. "If the wrong
people get elected, our city will be remembered as what used to be a
nice town but now is a ghost town."</TE>
<TE>   Escoto, 62, also supports Measure F, saying it fits into a larger
plan he has for revitalizing the downtown, generating jobs and
recruiting and retaining businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "Economic revitalization is the cornerstone of my campaign," said
Escoto, a lifelong Santa Paula resident who has served on the
Planning Commission and City Council.</TE>
<TE>   He is now a retiree, having worked 27 years for the county's
Public Works Agency before taking a job as field deputy for former
county Supervisor Maggie Kildee.</TE>
<TE>   Escoto said he supports Measure F because of the economic benefits
it would bring and because it would bring the 5,412-acre canyon under
city control. He said he also would promote creation of a downtown
plan, push to develop housing for all income levels and refocus
attention on tourism and cultural activities.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, the reason I am running is because I love this town,"
Escoto said. "And I think I have the experience that is needed to
make a contribution to my community."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County land use planner Graham said she has studied all of
the options put forth for boosting Santa Paula's flagging economy and
believes Measure F is the best of the bunch.</TE>
<TE>   So-called in-fill housing, touted by many for the downtown, cannot
lure enough investors to be profitable, she said. And development in
Fagan Canyon, identified by city voters two years ago as an area for
possible expansion, has various constraints, Graham said.</TE>
<TE>   "We need land available to us with fewer constraints to
development," said Graham, 47, an eight-year resident who serves on
the city's Planning Commission. "We need to find ways to increase our
purchasing power in the community and to bring more sales tax and
property tax revenues to our city."</TE>
<TE>   Graham said she also wants to work closely with schools on
planning issues, fight for good wages for the city's public employees
and shore up the city's housing stock.</TE>
<TE>   "I will push for economic revitalization and the continued
beautification and polishing of this beautiful gem we have," Graham
said.</TE>
<TE>   Krause said developing Adams Canyon is not the way to cure Santa
Paula's problems.</TE>
<TE>   The professional urban planner, who has lived in the city for 12
years and is involved in a variety of community activities, said city
leaders would be better off looking at land on the city's east end
for possible expansion and concentrating on improving the downtown
core with a mix of shops and housing.</TE>
<TE>   "In order to revitalize downtown, you have to have any new
development situated in a location where new residents will
assimilate into the community," said Krause, 52. "Adams Canyon is too
remote for that to occur."</TE>
<TE>   She notes that the city's recently updated housing element reports
that there are enough vacant properties in the city to support
development of 1,300 new housing units. Her goal is to help raise the
income of all residents by bringing more employers and better jobs to
the city.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an opportunity to change the direction of the City
Council, which I believe is important at this time," Krause said.</TE>
<TE>   Like Krause, Realtor Wisda opposes Measure F, pointing to a long
list of environmental problems and other concerns he believes
development would pose.</TE>
<TE>   Wisda, 54, said developing Adams Canyon is not the answer to the
city's struggling economy, and he believes the project could do more
harm than good.</TE>
<TE>   "The developer has not put any thought into how a development of
this size would affect the community," said Wisda, a 10-year
resident.</TE>
<TE>   Wisda supports the development of new homes in already approved
areas for expansion, such as Fagan Canyon, and in and around the
city's downtown.</TE>
<TE>   He said he would work to provide adequate pay to police officers
and firefighters, while looking hard at the city's budget to ensure
that public money is spent correctly.</TE>
<TE>   "They have basically done a bad fiscal job of watching citizens'
money," Wisda said of the current council. "The current economic
climate in Ventura County is strong, and Santa Paula needs to
capitalize on it."</TE>
<TE>   Incumbent Espinosa is in the middle of the strangest campaign of
her life.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the six other candidates, her name won't appear on the
ballot. The 48-year-old write-in candidate, first elected in 1994, is
counting on name recognition and her eight years in office to retain
her council seat.</TE>
<TE>   "It's somewhat of a challenge," said Espinosa, a legal assistant
with the county's child abduction division. "But everyone I have
spoken with has told me this is doable, especially in a small town."</TE>
<TE>   To make things simple, Espinosa has mounted a campaign using only
her first name.</TE>
<TE>   She said she has been assured by election officials that they will
accept "Laura," "Flores," "Espinosa," or any combination of the
three, as a vote for her.</TE>
<TE>   Espinosa said she has encountered little concern about her
write-in candidacy, which she said resulted from a misunderstanding
over when incumbents needed to file paperwork for reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, she said, voters have been interested in her campaign
platform, which includes defeating Measure F, creating a long-term
plan that outlines city priorities and finding ways to boost economic
development, job creation and housing development for residents of
all incomes.</TE>
<TE>   "I think my track record speaks for itself," she said. "I have
been totally committed to the residents of Santa Paula, and I think
they'll recognize that."</TE>

<HD>Ex-Studio Boss on Ryder Jury</HD>
<DH>Peter Guber, who ran Sony when it produced three of her
movies, is among 12 selected for the panel. The actress is accused of
shoplifting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carla Hall</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A jury of six men and six women was selected Friday in the Beverly
Hills shoplifting trial of actress Winona Ryder, including one
well-known Hollywood peer: the former chief of a giant studio that
oversaw the production of three of Ryder's best-known films.</LD>
<LD>   Peter Guber, who ran Sony Pictures Entertainment from 1989 to 1994
-- when it comprised both Columbia Pictures and Tri-Star -- was not
the only Hollywood connection impaneled with the approval of county
prosecutors and the defense. Also on the jury are a programming
development executive for an entertainment company and the husband of
a Disney Co. executive.</LD>
<LD>   At one point, as two dozen potential jurors were questioned, so
many had entertainment industry connections that Superior Court Judge
Elden Fox deadpanned, "I think we have all the studios represented."</LD>
<TE>   The jury pool members, whether they worked for Sony or Sizzler,
all made it clear that they were familiar with Ryder the actress and
Ryder the alleged felon.</TE>
<TE>   When asked by the judge whether there was anyone who did not know
of Ryder, no one raised a hand. Similarly, everyone had at least
heard of the matter bringing Ryder to court, where she is being tried
on charges of grand theft, burglary and vandalism stemming from her
arrest in the alleged shoplifting of about $6,000 worth of
merchandise from Saks Fifth Avenue in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Ann Rundle and defense attorney Mark Geragos --
as well as the judge -- asked a variety of questions to assess
whether potential jurors could deliberate impartially.</TE>
<TE>   But the first order of business was asking them whether they had
personal or professional ties to the entertainment business in
general and Ryder in particular.</TE>
<TE>   Guber, dressed in a gray suit and tie, raised his hand and
volunteered, "I was the chairman of Sony when one of the companies
under our control -- she made a picture for them."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Guber ran Sony when Ryder was making three big-budget
movies for Columbia Pictures -- "Bram Stoker's Dracula" in 1992; "The
Age of Innocence," in 1993, which earned her an Oscar nomination; and
"Little Women," which was in production during Guber's tenure but was
released in late 1994, shortly after his departure.</TE>
<TE>   As head of Sony, Guber had ultimate authority over all productions
at Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   Asked by the judge whether he felt he could render a fair and
impartial verdict, Guber said he could.</TE>
<TE>   A day earlier, Guber, on an elevator in the Beverly Hills
courthouse, had said casually out loud, "I have about as much chance
of getting on this jury as the man in the moon. I only made three
pictures with the lady."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Rundle nor Geragos probed Guber for the details of his
ties to Ryder. Instead, both pointed their questions toward whether
Guber, 60, who now runs Mandalay Entertainment, would feel
comfortable sitting in judgment of Ryder.</TE>
<TE>   "Would there be any repercussions for you?" Rundle asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Me?" Guber asked. "No."</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Guber, you're not afraid of working in this town again after
sitting on this jury?" asked Geragos to laughter from the courtroom.
Guber indicated he was not afraid.</TE>
<TE>   Although both sides could have peremptorily struck Guber from the
jury, neither did.</TE>
<TE>   Other jurors include a teacher, a UCLA graduate student, a woman
who works at a fast-food restaurant, an aerospace engineer, a woman
who works for a mortgage company and an obstetrician-gynecologist.</TE>
<TE>   The judge also heard a request from Susan Seager, an attorney
representing the Los Angeles Times and Associated Press, for
transcripts of proceedings that took place in a closed court session
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Fox declined to provide them, saying they were pretrial motions on
evidence that might not be introduced during the trial.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the court's intention to prevent the public from knowing
evidence related to this trial," the judge said. "It is the court's
intention to prevent the public and prospective jurors from knowing
evidence that will not be part of this trial."</TE>
<TE>   Seager said outside of court, "He basically thinks the right to
public access only extends to the trial itself and not pretrial
proceedings, and that is just not correct. The U.S. Supreme Court has
made it clear that pretrial proceedings are just as open as trial
proceedings."</TE>
<TE>   The closed hearing involved at least four motions dealing with the
type of evidence that could be entered at trial.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder appeared in court wearing a white sheath under a buttoned-up
dusky blue long coat jacket with pink high-heeled mules. She wrote
copiously on a yellow legal pad. During the many sidebars that
prospective jurors asked for -- so they could answer questions from
the judge in private -- she cast occasional polite glances at the men
and women who might decide her fate. The prospective jurors, for
their parts, proved excellent poker players, betraying no feelings of
being star-struck.</TE>
<TE>   When the prosecutor asked one juror whether she would ever decide
that the prosecutor had proved her case but would not convict because
Ryder had been subjected to so much publicity, the juror shook her
head, no. "I think when someone has a celebrity status, that's part
of what goes along with it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the usual judicial admonitions against discussing
the case or reading about it, the judge added one more: no shopping
at Saks for the duration of the trial. "I'm sure they won't
appreciate that, but I think you can get along for five to seven
days," Fox said.</TE>

<HD>Secession Staffers Refuse to Give Up</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sue Fox</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Like I've told you all along, it's grass-roots," John Ferrero said,
a hint of irritation shading his voice. "We need every single body we
can get."</LD>
<LD>   He paused, cell phone pressed hard to his ear to blot out the din
from buses roaring down Ventura Boulevard. "Look, I'm full of things
that could've been, should've been, but we have to deal with the
cards that we're dealt," he told the volunteer at the other end of
the line.</LD>
<LD>   As the campaign for San Fernando Valley secession hits its final
lap, Ferrero, 42, has cleared his schedule of almost everything else.
A corporate efficiency consultant, this Studio City dad has become a
full-time cheerleader for cityhood, helping drive a movement
perilously short on other resources.</LD>
<TE>   With little cash and few well-known candidates seeking office in
the proposed Valley city, just about all the secession campaign has
left is its volunteers. There are 600 listed in the database, all
neatly parceled into phone trees and e-mail groups. It is unclear how
many of them will actually turn out to knock on doors and staff phone
banks.</TE>
<TE>   Ferrero and a few dozen others may spend their days handing out
fliers at supermarkets and stapling lawn signs to wooden stakes, but
when the campaign held an open house Tuesday night to train
volunteers to walk precincts, only a handful showed up.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it takes a lot to quench the ardor of true-blue
secessionists.</TE>
<TE>   They tend to dismiss any evidence suggesting that the breakup
proposal -- Measure F on the Nov. 5 ballot -- could flop. After a
recent Times survey found that likely voters citywide opposed Valley
secession 2 to 1, Ferrero said: "The poll only talked to 970 [likely]
voters. That's less than 1% of the Valley's population."</TE>
<TE>   Working out of a storefront office in a Sherman Oaks mini-mall
with walls painted the color of a Creamsicle, the secessionists have
perfected the art of looking on the bright side.</TE>
<TE>   Each time he slices open an envelope and fishes out a check, Joe
Vitti lets out a cheer.</TE>
<TE>   "Fifty dollars from Mr. Pollack, an M.D. from Woodland Hills!" he
cried. "Twenty-five dollars from Clifford Van Ness! He's from North
Hills. Every one of these helps.... Whoa, this is 500 bucks! Earl and
Toba Greinetz. Wow!"</TE>
<TE>   Both Ferrero and Vitti, a 68-year-old grandfather who lives in
Granada Hills, are "quadrant leaders." They are in charge of
volunteers in their respective quarters of the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   At one time, secession leader Richard Katz vowed to marshal 3,000
people to take the cityhood message to the streets. But separatists
succeeded in drafting only a fraction of that number.</TE>
<TE>   Ferrero, who is leading the southeast Valley effort, estimates
that he has about 150 volunteers. Six or eight of them have joined
him to walk precincts on the weekends, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the setbacks, a sort of folksy, hail-fellow enthusiasm
crackles through the campaign. There are many here who insist
secession still has a fighting chance, and they're fired up by the
populist zeal that comes with taking on City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "I like being on David's side and not Goliath's," said Aaron
Goode, a shaggy-haired Yale student volunteering for the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Smiles and hugs prevail, whether or not the cameras are clicking.
But at public events, it's important to look spiffy.</TE>
<TE>   Ferrero, who usually favors jeans and tight T-shirts that show off
his brawny arms, slipped into a charcoal-gray suit for a recent news
conference. He and some of the better-known faces of secession--Katz
and Jeff Brain--grinned and glad-handed, some giving TV interviews,
as voters cast early ballots on the county's new touch-screen
machines.</TE>
<TE>   An hour later, Ferrero was back at campaign headquarters, stapling
together more lawn signs. Laura DiGilio, a firecracker in a red,
white and blue blazer, burst into the office.</TE>
<TE>   A Granada Hills woman who wears a beaded necklace depicting tiny
American flags, DiGilio is known in secession circles as the
volunteer who collected the second-largest number of signatures
during the 1998 petition drive to push Valley cityhood toward the
ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "We need more attention over here out in the Valley," she said. "I
don't even have a street light on my corner. I don't feel comfortable
walking in my neighborhood at night."</TE>
<TE>   Near the back of the office, campaign field director Chuck Levin
murmured into the phone about a new KABC-TV poll showing the
secession proposal leading in the Valley. Two sweaty volunteers
ambled in, fresh from hanging a campaign banner from a billboard in
Tarzana. A 62-year-old house painter named Ralph dropped by to write
a $100 check.</TE>
<TE>   Such gestures are manna to the faithful.</TE>
<TE>   "In the majority of campaigns, you spend a lot of time trying to
draw people in," said Levin, a 55-year-old campaign veteran with a
mop of snow-white hair. "That's what's remarkable about this
campaign. People just naturally embrace the concept."</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, some secession leaders have begun to openly
acknowledge the possibility of defeat. They worry about potential
retaliation from the mayor and pledge to reintroduce the breakup
measure in years to come.</TE>
<TE>   But hope still reigns in the trenches, where volunteers say they
know what they see with their own eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Every time they go to a community meeting or set up a booth at a
street fair, they say, people respond positively. Every day, Valley
residents drop by the campaign's Sherman Oaks headquarters to pick up
"Yes on F" posters.</TE>
<TE>   And hundreds of contributors keep mailing in checks. The tally on
a recent day: $7,071.99.</TE>
<TE>   On the same day, Mayor James K. Hahn's anti-secession campaign
reported raising $25,000 from a Beverly Hills construction firm.
Hahn's L.A. United has raked in $5.5 million from developers, labor
unions, movie studios and other breakup opponents. Secessionists have
raised one-tenth that.</TE>
<TE>   Ferrero has his reasons for supporting a breakup. A native of
Chatsworth who grew up catching frogs and riding horses in the hills
around his family's ranch, Ferrero saw Valley cityhood as a way to
stem unchecked development and improve public schools and police.</TE>
<TE>   Like some other high-octane volunteers, Ferrero is running for a
City Council seat in the proposed Valley city. "The platform really
is about enriching the community and keeping our money here in the
Valley," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But when he cranked up his card table outside a Vons grocery store
on a blustery afternoon, Ferrero talked up Valley independence more
than his 14th Council District campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "How ya doin'?" he called out again and again as shoppers streamed
past. "Fine," many of them mumbled without stopping. Some did not
answer.</TE>
<TE>   But in the course of two chilly hours, at least a dozen people
said they planned to support Measure F. Still, Ferrero didn't even
try to persuade Ruth Bercutt, a 90-year-old woman in pastels who told
him firmly that she favored keeping the city whole.</TE>
<TE>   "I've lived in Los Angeles since I was 9 years old. Why should I
leave now?" said Bercutt, a retired Los Angeles Unified schoolteacher
from Valley Village. "I think the city's been fair. I don't think
that I've been denied anything."</TE>
<TE>   When another woman charged past, hollering, "It will raise the
rent!" Ferrero knew better than to waste his time chasing her for a
rebuttal.</TE>
<TE>   "She's one of those people we run into," he said with a shrug,
"who doesn't want her mind changed."</TE>

<HD>The Homeless Need Solutions</HD>
<DH>Compassion isn't missing, but programs are.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joel John Roberts</AU>
<BD>Joel John Roberts is executive director of People
Assisting the Homeless, a regional nonprofit agency.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The new -- and some say punitive -- homeless ordinances in Santa
Monica almost certainly reflect what much of Southern California
feels. But it is not so much "compassion fatigue" as a desire to see
better solutions.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Monica City Council banned programs that served meals to
the homeless living in public parks and outlawed sleeping in doorways
of downtown businesses.</LD>
<LD>   Clearly, the law is a response to aggressive panhandling at
freeway offramps and in busy shopping districts. People are reacting
to trash tossed about, sidewalks smelling of urine and having to step
around homeless people on the ground. Businesses are worried about
the loss of tourism and customers. The Los Angeles City Council has
already instructed the city attorney to draft comparable ordinances.</LD>
<TE>   There is no less compassion now than years ago. People are still
willing to respond, and generously give, to the hurting and needy --
look at the outpouring after Sept. 11, 2001, for the families of
victims and people who lost their jobs. However, people are tired of
the lack of solutions to the growing blight of so many people living
on the streets, subsisting on handouts. Food programs that are not
linked to services to help get people off the streets and into drug
or alcohol treatment, mental health assistance, housing and even jobs
do not solve anything.</TE>
<TE>   Good solutions mean investing significant resources, but the
social payoff would be substantial. Here are four pragmatic proposals
that, if implemented, would dramatically alter the landscape:</TE>
<TE>   * Clean streets, not mean streets. Provide a shelter bed linked
with support services for every person on the streets. If we want to
ban people from sleeping on sidewalks and streets, we first need to
provide them with a safe and secure place to go. We are not
criminalizing homelessness if we provide shelter linked with
services. Feeding programs would not be needed if people were
guaranteed a bed and meals.</TE>
<TE>   * Integrate existing homeless services. Services scattered across
the county force people to travel discouraging distances by bus and
on foot to find help. Services such as health care, mental health and
substance abuse assistance, job programs, education and even haircuts
should be under one roof. This would help not just clients but the
community by reducing street people's presence while increasing the
likelihood that they would find a permanent way off the streets. My
homeless organization takes this approach. We have 19 government and
private service agencies housed in one mall location, just off the
101 Freeway near Vermont Avenue. We hope others will follow the same
approach.</TE>
<TE>   * Prevent homelessness through better discharge planning. Los
Angeles County releases a stream of people onto the streets every
day. Foster youth who turn 18 are forced to leave their homes, adults
are released from jail, patients are discharged from mental health
and substance abuse facilities with no place to go. They end up on
the streets. These people need help finding permanent places to live.</TE>
<TE>   * Build more affordable housing. The working poor and already
homeless are all but locked out of the costly local apartment market.
Proposition 46, a housing bond on the Nov. 5 ballot, would provide a
big boost. So will the city of Los Angeles' new housing trust fund,
which is about to issue a plan for spending the $100 million that the
city has promised.</TE>
<TE>   By concentrating on effective ways to keep people off the streets
to begin with, cities would not need ordinances that seem to
criminalize homelessness.</TE>

<HD>Don't Close the Door on Halloween Tradition</HD>
<DH>Ignore urban myths -- let the kids have fun.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Linda Williamson</AU>
<BD>Linda Williamson is a freelance writer in Granada
Hills.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last Halloween, I witnessed a trick-or-treat phenomenon I didn't
remember from my childhood. When I looked out of my pumpkin- and
candle-bedecked windows, I saw kids being dropped off in
minivan-loads. They'd pile out of their parents' cars, hit a few
houses and pile back in again to be shuttled to the next stop.</LD>
<LD>   My first assumption was that these kids must be lazy. But a short
trek around the block revealed the real problem. Very few houses in
the neighborhood had their porch lights on, and even fewer had any
specifically welcoming signs like ghosts or jack-o'-lanterns. I
realized that any kid traveling by sidewalk would have to walk for
blocks to collect a halfway decent sack of candy.</LD>
<LD>   Fear-mongering, well-publicized kidnappings and shootings and
persistent urban folk tales about razor blades in apples have had a
cumulative, erosive effect on the trick-or-treat tradition, and it
seems in danger of extinction right alongside the milkman,
hitchhiking and neighbors who know your name and say hello.</LD>
<TE>   Instead of going from door to door in the neighborhood, many
parents are opting for the controlled environment of private
Halloween parties.</TE>
<TE>   This change is another sign that as a culture, we're becoming more
and more afraid of each other. That's a shame, because the vast
majority of people are no less decent than they were in the "good old
days," whenever those may have been.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that people are suddenly endangering children more often.
It's just that in our information-saturated time, we hear about it
more often and more quickly when something goes amiss.</TE>
<TE>   Use our abundant Information Age resources to combat fear: Go on
the Internet and look up "The Razor Blade in the Apple: The Social
Construction of Urban Legends." Two Southern Illinois University
professors researched newspaper articles and emergency room records
dating back to 1958 and found that the myth of the "Halloween sadist"
who gave out tainted candy to random children was bunk. The only
Halloween poisonings they uncovered were, sadly, by a few people who
found an opportunity to harm their own children.</TE>
<TE>   Those people are few. The vast majority of people love their kids.
And if you're one of these, why not take this opportunity to dress
them up, march them up to every door in your neighborhood and let the
folks fawn over them? While you're there, say hello and introduce
yourself.</TE>
<TE>   Don't have kids? Open your door on Halloween. It's only one night
a year, only lasts about few hours and it's a great way to get to
know your neighbors. And a neighborhood full of people who know each
other is a safer neighborhood. Take a chance. Halloween isn't as
scary as you think.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Unified Plays Catch-Up</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the latest Academic Performance Index results, elementary school
teachers and principals in the Los Angeles Unified School District
finally have a reason to hold their heads up. Sadly, their high
school colleagues are not part of this success, so a lost generation
of badly educated teenagers stumbles toward adulthood.</LD>
<LD>   Even in elementary schools, the scores missed the ultimate goal of
800 by a mile, but they were closer. More than two-thirds of L.A.
Unified's campuses qualified for API awards, which are based on
improvement. The children at those schools might not be cheering all
that loudly, though, because the cash-strapped state has suspended
the awards. When California lawmakers set up the carrot-and-stick
approach to encourage schools to improve, it appears they forgot to
make sure they could afford the carrots. Talk about underperforming.</LD>
<LD>   That doesn't take away from the right to be proud of a job well
done. L.A. Unified schools were much more likely to have hit their
improvement targets than schools statewide, more than L.A. County
schools as a whole, more than the wealthier neighboring counties of
Orange and Ventura. Of the 30 elementary schools with the biggest API
gains statewide, 12 are in L.A. Unified.</LD>
<TE>   The congratulatory confetti, though, vanishes when it comes to
older students. Only 11% of L.A. high schools merited the
reneged-upon awards, a figure well below the state average. In other
words, not only do L.A.'s teenagers have much further to go, they're
also falling further behind. This is dismal news when you consider
that California high schoolers in general are not pulling up their
scores like the younger kids.</TE>
<TE>   The state's explanations for the lower scores and lackluster
improvement at California's high schools make sense. Today's
teenagers didn't have the 20-student classes in kindergarten through
third grade. The state's curriculum standards only recently came into
the classroom; today's teenagers are taking on tougher work without
having done the prep work. High school scores should improve over the
next several years, the Department of Education tells us. But that
means nothing for the teenagers who've been left out of the success
equation.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Unified deserves, and has gotten, plenty of criticism for
promoting these kids for years without making sure they learned the
basics. But at least the district is making a frantic last effort to
make up for mistakes. Its new "Language!" remedial reading program
returns teenagers to "the cat is on the mat," this time making sure
they master the lesson. California's Department of Education needs to
push such programs.</TE>
<TE>   Even with all that catch-up, many students will be far behind.
Their consolation prize: The state probably will hold off on the high
school exit exam because so many fell short in early rounds. They can
grab a diploma and go off woefully ill prepared for college or good
jobs. At least they will be marginally literate.</TE>

<HD>Look Closely, Mammoth</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Federal Aviation Administration is putting money behind its
absurd conclusion that expanding the Mammoth Lakes airport to handle
Boeing 757 jets bringing in skiers from Chicago and Dallas wouldn't
hurt the environment of the Eastern Sierra. The agency has allocated
$20 million to the town of Mammoth Lakes to begin work on the
expansion project.</LD>
<LD>   State Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer is challenging the airport expansion
in U.S. district court, arguing that it "threatens significant
growth-inducing impacts on an ecologically fragile and unique region
of California" that includes Yosemite National Park, Mono Lake and
two wilderness areas.</LD>
<LD>   Lockyer, joined by environmental groups, wants the court to order
the FAA to conduct a full environmental impact study of both the
direct and cumulative effects of the airport project.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, the study also should consider the overall effect wrought
by Intrawest, the giant resort company that holds a majority interest
in Mammoth Mountain Ski Area and is spending $500 million on the ski
area and the town below. The company is building an upscale village
in the town, to be linked to the ski area by a gondola.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the village with its shops and restaurants,
Intrawest has built a golf course, condos and lavish townhouses that
nudge $1 million in price. That figure's no big deal in Vail, Colo.,
but it's something to gasp about in Mammoth.</TE>
<TE>   Intrawest officials have promised to transform Mammoth Lakes into
the No. 1 mountain resort community in North America, bigger and
"better" presumably than Vail, Aspen and a large Intrawest property,
Whistler-Blackcomb in British Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   If that's so, Mammoth will follow Vail and others into an alpine
urbanism that prices moderate- and low-income people out of the
housing market, creates sprawl in nearby areas where they can still,
for now, find affordable housing and causes havoc in the fragile
high-altitude environment.</TE>
<TE>   It is a classic pattern documented by former Aspen journalist Hal
Clifford in his new book "Downhill Slide: Why the Corporate Ski
Industry Is Bad for Skiing, Ski Towns and the Environment." The book
should be mandatory reading at Mammoth town offices.</TE>
<TE>   Clifford says the publicly traded corporations are driven more by
real estate profits than by the ski business. They seek short-term
gains to satisfy stockholders rather than long-term stability for the
mountain community.</TE>
<TE>   "They have contributed significantly to the urbanization and
gentrification of some of America's most magnificent places,"
Clifford writes. "They have displaced human communities and damaged
natural ones."</TE>
<TE>   That is the pattern looming before Mammoth. That is why a full
environmental impact study now is so important. Town officials say
they have done one, but the survey was laughably inadequate.
Intrawest and town leaders claim everyone would benefit from the
proposed transformation to an upscale destination resort. But that's
not the experience of other resorts.</TE>
<TE>   Mammoth residents deserve to know the full effect of this massive
investment. After all, it's their town too.</TE>

<LD>Paul Wellstone, killed in a plane crash Friday, was a passionate,
unapologetic liberal in the rich tradition of the Minnesota
Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party and U.S. senators like Hubert H.
Humphrey, Walter F. Mondale and Eugene McCarthy. He fought in the
Senate for the people of Minnesota, the poor, the young, the old, the
workers, farmers.</LD>
<LD>   Wellstone followed his beliefs without fear of political risk or
whether he might anger his own Democratic colleagues. Recently, he
was the only Democratic senator in a tough reelection race to vote
against President Bush's Iraqi war resolution. But he had opposed
U.S. military action in the Gulf War too.</LD>
<LD>   And he crossed Democratic President Bill Clinton by voting against
the 1996 Welfare Reform Act.</LD>
<TE>   This streak of activism and independence was nothing new for
Wellstone. As a Carleton College professor, he taught the politics of
protest and practiced what he preached. Wellstone was on the line
with striking Hormel meatpackers and protested in front of a bank
that foreclosed on local farmers. After his stunning upset election
to the Senate in 1990, the left-leaning magazine Mother Jones called
Wellstone the first 1960s radical to serve in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   But he was not just a knee-jerk partisan. With Sen. Pete V.
Domenici, a Republican from New Mexico, he fought for better mental
health insurance. Domenici was so distressed by the news of
Wellstone's death that he could not comment for a television
interview.</TE>
<TE>   Wellstone's death, along with that of his wife and daughter, three
aides and the pilots, was a shock, much as similar deaths of
politicians in the past, flying hither and yon in small planes, and
often in bad weather, to keep the commitments of a busy schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Wellstone was a bright star within the fading constellation
of true political independents who have an abiding desire to make
life better for constituents and are willing to sacrifice short-term
political gain in favor of winning lasting benefit. As Minnesota
Democrats ponder a possible replacement on the election ticket at
this late date, they should seek a candidate who will try to carry on
that tradition.</TE>

<LD>Re "Vatican to Reject Parts of U.S. Bishops' Abuse Policy," Oct. 18:
I can't help being amazed at the words of the spokesperson for the
Archdiocese of Los Angeles, who proclaimed to the whole city and
world that this archdiocese will not, in any way, be affected by the
latest decisions emanating from Rome regarding the Dallas policies
adopted by the U.S. bishops. Has Cardinal Roger Mahony forgotten the
words of the second Vatican Council that explicitly state that the
Roman pontiff has full, supreme and universal power over the church?
Am I wrong to presume that the Los Angeles Archdiocese is a part of
the universal church, not an independent church that can do as it
pleases?</LD>
<LD>   As an informed Roman Catholic, I am fully aware that a bishop
governs, teaches and sanctifies in union with the supreme pontiff,
not in opposition to him or the Holy See. At least on this particular
issue, I will obey and support the bishop of Rome, not my archbishop,
who is now implementing some policies that the Holy See has found
defective and in violation of canon law. We are not Donatists, we are
Catholic!</LD>
<LD>   Many innocent priests have not been given due process at the same
time that some bishops, like our cardinal, who are part of the
problem, refuse to step down because of an arrogant attitude that
flies in the face of the virtue of humility.</LD>
<TE>   The whole idea of forgiveness and redemption was forgotten in
Dallas, and the Holy See is only trying to correct the failure to
acknowledge the implementation of elemental biblical teaching in the
policies adopted in June by our American bishops.</TE>

<TE>   Where are the new rules for face-to-face confessions, training
altar servers, taking children on outings or even calling a child out
of class or church? Until the elitist culture that places the priest
at the pinnacle of unquestioned authority is replaced by concrete
laws, rules and regulations, Catholic society will continue to chase
predators after the crimes are committed and the children are
damaged. It is not the rule of men but the rule of law that must
control.</TE>

<TE>   Catholics are polled, priests are polled, questions are asked
about sexual orientation and about the "one strike and you're out"
policy for clerical abusers, but one thing at least seems clear to
this Catholic. The relation of the clergy to the laity resembles the
old adage about "the blind leading the blind." Liberal Catholics
still pretend that the crisis in the church is about pedophiles even
though most of the victims of abuse are adolescents, not children.
Liberals cannot -- for politically correct reasons -- admit that
homosexuals in the church are the abusers of the young.</TE>
<TE>   Conservatives pretend that celibacy is not the issue here, even
though it is obvious that celibacy encourages priestly careers for
sexually deviant men and discourages them for sexually normal men.
They cannot admit that a nonbiblical policy that has existed for a
thousand years can be wrong in a church that pretends infallibility.
Will anyone trust these people again?</TE>

homosexuality, abortion and contraceptives. This is not a comforting

contraception. He certainly didn't forbid loving gay relationships,
freely chosen abortions or the prudent use of contraceptives.</TE>

<HD>Trauma Measure for L.A.</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Vote Yes for Trauma Care," editorial, Oct. 18:</LD>
<LD>   L.A. County Measure B is a Band-Aid remedy to cure a serious
cancer in the health-care crisis. Homeowners, however, should view
Measure B as a sneaky attempt to circumvent the protections of Prop.
13.</LD>
<LD>   Right now, for many, the amount seems small, just 3 cents per
square foot. But voters will forever surrender to the politicians the
control and power to increase this tax annually, tied to the rate of
medical inflation. There are no caps on the amount this tax can be
increased, and no further voter approval will be required. It is
interesting to note that in the sample ballot, not one of the
supervisors who voted to include this measure had the guts to be
listed as a supporter.</LD>
<TE>   Trauma care is an essential service for everyone living, working
or traveling in L.A. County. The benefits have little direct
connection to property ownership. To impose the burden of rescuing
the trauma-care program on the homeowners of L.A. County is grossly
unfair. This burden should be shared by everyone.</TE>
<TE>   The causes indicated in your editorial for the health-care crisis
are attributed to illegal immigration and the high uninsured rate of
L.A. County. The solutions to these problems can be resolved only at
the federal and state level. Los Angeles County property owners
should vote no on Measure B.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Bajinting</TE>
<TE>   Whittier</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As your editorial correctly points out, though Measure B by no
means provides a total solution to the county's health-care funding
crisis, it represents an essential step in the right direction. As
the county continues its eleventh-hour negotiations with the federal
and state governments, it is imperative that we deliver a strong
turnout in favor of Measure B. In bolstering the county's case for
federal assistance, we must demonstrate that our citizens are willing
to bear a proportionate share of the costs associated with vitally
important emergency and trauma-care programs.</TE>
<TE>   A common misconception regarding Measure B is that property owners
will bear the entire burden. In actuality, the costs will be spread
between property owners and renters through rental payments to the
landlords. In the wake of the county's looming funding crisis, a vote
for Measure B is a vote for preserving the integrity of Harbor-UCLA,
Olive View and other core components of the county-operated
health-care system.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Times is right in saying the federal government must step up to
the plate and stop discriminating against people with mental illness
("A Deadly Group Home," editorial, Oct. 21). The discrimination comes
from a little-known restriction in Medicaid known as the Institutions
for Mental Diseases exclusion. While the federal insurance plan will
pay for hospital care beyond 30 days for people with other medical
disorders (strokes and Parkinson's are examples), it excludes payment
for long-term care of people with brain disorders such as
schizophrenia.</LD>
<LD>   There is a disastrous trickle-down effect of neglect that results
from this exclusion as states and counties try to utilize the allowed
federal benefits. People with mental illnesses who need extended
hospitalization frequently do not receive it. They are instead placed
in facilities that are not up to their needs for care and treatment.
And county funds that could be used in the community to shore up
out-of-hospital services are diverted to the long-term care for the
few who do receive it. It's time to stop the discrimination. The
president's New Freedom Mental Health Commission should look
carefully at your suggestion.</LD>

<TE>   Homelessness is a tragedy, but allowing our nation's veterans to
live on the streets is a national disgrace. Many of our veterans have
suffered the trauma and stresses of war.</TE>
<TE>   This year, New Directions opened a model 43-bed treatment
facility. The program was developed in collaboration with the
Veterans Affairs Department to address the multiple needs of veterans
who are diagnosed with a major mental illness and a substance abuse
disorder (dual diagnosis). Many also suffer from hepatitis C and
other health issues. The funding, foundation grants and donations are
no longer available for this project.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Los Angeles has no mental health funding, and L.A.
County's Department of Mental Health has had dramatic cuts and
refuses to fund programs that serve veterans because it feels that
the VA ought to be providing this service. The VA continues to cut
mental health funding, and the state Department of Mental Health does
not provide direct funding and has no dual-diagnosis grants.</TE>
<TE>   It is critical for Bush's New Freedom Mental Health Commission to
make funding for programs that are finding solutions for individuals
with co-occurring disorders (especially veterans) a priority.
Americans cannot go to war and expect our soldiers to return
unscathed. Homelessness is not an answer to mental illness; it is a
symptom of political priorities.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The mechanism for accomplishing what you term "clean,
well-staffed, independence-oriented alternatives" financed through
the Medicaid system is already in place and requires no new
legislation. Medicaid funding (called Medi-Cal in California) for
adult residential treatment programs, group homes and the like for
people with severe and persistent mental illness has been recognized
since 1993 in California for programs with relatively small, homelike
environments, 16 beds and under, through a waiver granted by the
federal government in connection with the state's adoption of the
so-called "rehab option." The federal government picks up 50% of the
cost for those who are Medi-Cal eligible. Ours was the first of these
programs locally to be so funded in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, there has not been either the will or the funding
available by the state for the federal government to match on a
dollar-for-dollar basis these vitally needed services beyond 1993
levels. As you correctly point out, so-called "independent living"
solutions are unlicensed and unregulated, and they typically lack the
structure and support necessary for clients to make it on their own.
They are cheaper short-term solutions, but without support,
monitoring and a rehabilitative focus, clients frequently
decompensate and ultimately require much more expensive inpatient
care, resulting at best in the revolving-door phenomenon and, at
worst, in incarceration or, as you suggest, even death.</TE>

<LD>Re "Hooked on Phonics? We Should Lose This Addiction," by Mary Lee
Griffin, Commentary, Oct. 22: Structured reading programs have helped
more students than they've hurt.</LD>
<LD>   In California, we went through a decades-long phonics alternative,
the whole-language reading instruction program and found it lacking.
There seemed to be a strong causal relationship between lack of
structure in the reading program at induction and the lack of
interest in reading found in older students at the "low-performing
schools."</LD>
<LD>   There is substantial evidence that a structured approach to
reading in the primary K-3 grades is helpful at low-performing
schools. Certainly, with class-size reduction, a focus on English
immersion and a structured reading program, we are seeing much more
active and interested readers at the middle-school level here in my
corner of the south San Joaquin Valley. With the end of mandated
bilingual instruction for nonnative speakers, the inclusion of
phonics in any balanced reading program is essential.</LD>

<TE>   As a mother of three young adults, all book lovers, I
wholeheartedly agree with Griffin, although I would like to add one
more factor in helping kids become not only good readers but possess
a love of reading all of their lives. There is research that shows
that a very important factor in reading success is based on skillful
parents as well as skillful teachers. Parents who provide their
children with books and make "story time" a part of every day -- from
infancy on -- create an environment where books and reading are
associated with time spent with parents in a positive way. Parents
are also able, through example, to introduce their children to the
magic of books.</TE>

<TE>   California parents who share Griffin's distaste for our current
frenzy over phonics can check up on her assertions by asking
themselves four questions: Can my child read the first sentence from
The Times out loud (front page, far-left column)? Can my child
recognize most of the place names on the front page? Can my child
understand (and spell) most of the words on the front page? Can my
child identify the main verb of the first sentence?</TE>
<TE>   Phonics or whole language, shouldn't parents be able to judge for
themselves exactly how well our schools are doing -- especially on
the K-8 level?</TE>

<LD>   It's sad that Troupe felt compelled to claim on paper he'd
graduated from Grambling University. He's a poet, a distinction
attained by few. Let this be enough for him; his work stands above
the paltry piece of paper that says "baccalaureate." And when anyone
asks if he has his degrees, all he needs to say, with pride, is "no,"
then point to his body of work.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ronald Minsk criticizes the Bush administration for beginning to fill
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to its capacity of 700 million
barrels (Commentary, Oct. 20). At the start of the Clinton
administration, the inventory of the SPR equated to 83 days of
imports. In the next eight years, the reserve's inventory was reduced
due to ill-advised nonemergency sales of 28 million barrels of oil in
1996 and an interventionist "exchange" of 30 million barrels in 2000.
By the end of the Clinton administration, the reserve inventory
equated to just 53 days of imports.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration is determined to reverse this
deterioration and, in coordination with other consuming countries,
restore the power and durability of the world's strategic reserves.
The most common measure of potency is the number of days of imports
the reserve can replace, and President Bush has wisely directed that
we provide a larger cushion.</LD>
<LD>   The SPR is a form of insurance against disruptions and their
associated price spikes that have devastated world economies three
times since 1973. It is our first and, by far, most important
protection against those disruptions.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As a California-licensed nursing home administrator since 1979, I
want your readers to understand that a nursing home is simply a
reflection of society ("Nursing Homes Are Criticized," Oct. 16).</LD>
<LD>   When we as a society come to value the elderly, infirm and
disabled more than a new or classic automobile, we will have
accomplished something important. When our state regulators start to
communicate with administrators and directors of nurses about what
resources nursing homes need to improve care instead of how much we
cost, we will also start to get somewhere.</LD>
<LD>   It is simpler to cry "neglect" than to preserve dignity on a
24-hour basis for the infirm elderly, disabled and dying, given the

<LD>Reporters Megan Stack and Jonathan Peterson made a great team ("A Day
Fear Reached a New Level," Oct. 23) when they wrote, "Time is
passing. Fall is flaming red and orange in the woods; trees weep dead
leaves over empty sidewalks and the bite of winter has stolen into
the air." Alone, the passage is a beautiful description of
approaching winter. Against the back story of sniper murders, the
prose pushed my latent anxiety that I will fail to live to a ripe old
age to a new level.</LD>

<HD>An Epidemic of Autism</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re " 'Sobering' State Report Calls Autism an Epidemic," Oct. 18: I am
president of the Autism Society of California and have two children
with autism. The results of the study cited reiterate what most
parents of children with autism already know: Autism is an epidemic
in California. It is a relief to see it finally in writing, using
scientific methods for validity.</LD>
<LD>   The Autism Society and the autism community at large have, for
many years, advocated for research into causes and therapies to help
our children. It fell on deaf ears for so long because the
"incidence" of autism didn't "justify" the research. The Centers for
Disease Control now estimates as many as 1 in 500 are affected with
autism. Do we now, finally, have the "incidence" needed to justify
spending money on research for this lifelong disorder?</LD>
<LD>   Some research is finally happening, but very little is being done
to help the families provide therapies that may help their children
today.</LD>
<TE>   For most families, the therapies and services needed are
expensive, and some require legal action in order to obtain them.
Also, there are not enough trained "autism specific" service
providers to go around for the demand. We hope that we can build
awareness of autism and the needs of the autism community. This is
not a condition that, if ignored, goes away.</TE>

<TE>   As the father of an autistic child, I have observed that parents
are much more intent on getting their children the proper help once a
problem has been diagnosed than in the past. Also, they keep their
children at home and as a part of the family -- and in society's eyes
-- immensely more than they used to, rather than sending them into
institutions.</TE>
<TE>   My wife and I saw many doctors in the pursuit of a cure for our
autistic son. To our dismay, a doctor whom we were referred to
recommended that we put him in an institution, forget about him and
get on with our lives. And this recommendation was made even though
he had "high functioning" skills that surpassed those of many
"normal" kids. In the past, many parents would either submit to this
horrible advice or keep their loving but challenged kids within the
home, not to be seen by anyone.</TE>
<TE>   No more. That is what society is saying and that is why there has
been a so-called "epidemic." Our kids will stay in their loving homes
and we parents will pursue the best educational and medical means to
have them succeed to the best of their abilities.</TE>

<TE>   I read with sadness about the explosive growth of people with
autism. But my sadness turned to anger when the article included the
allegation that some believed the measles-mumps- rubella vaccine to
be the cause of the rise of autism. Repeatedly, the best medical
research organizations in this country and around the world have
determined that vaccines do not cause autism. The MMR vaccine has
been available in California for more than two decades and the
measles vaccine has been around since 1963 -- long before this tragic
wave of autism.</TE>
<TE>   It is easy to jump to false conclusions when a child has a serious
illness with no obvious cause. But the diseases that vaccines prevent
are very, very real. Vaccines do not cause autism; they save lives
and protect our children from very real diseases. As a survivor of
the last polio epidemic in America, I cannot speak out forcefully
enough to stress the value of childhood immunization. No family
should suffer as mine and thousands of others did during the "polio
summers" of 50 years ago. Please don't put your children at risk of
real diseases in the mistaken belief you are protecting them from
autism.</TE>

<TE>   It is no mystery to us that there is an autism epidemic in
California. Autism research concentrates on genetics when it should
be looking at immunology research.</TE>
<TE>   Why are children with autism indicating elevated measles antibody
titers? This should be looked into with clinical science. Too many
vaccines at too early an age is more than likely the culprit. It is
no mystery to the parents and independent researchers what is going
on with this epidemic. There has never been nor will there ever be a
genetic epidemic. So why are all the millions of dollars in research
funds going to genetic research for autism?</TE>

<LD>A prosecutor known for her aggressive enforcement of environmental
laws said Friday that she had resigned after repeated clashes with
Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas regarding an environmental
contamination case against the Atlantic Richfield Co.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County sued the giant oil company in 2000 to force it to
clean up contamination from leaking underground gasoline tanks at
dozens of the company's service stations in the county.</LD>
<LD>   The case focused on the additive MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl
ether), a possible carcinogen that officials say flowed along with
the leaking gasoline dangerously close to the county's drinking water
aquifer.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors and an Arco spokesman disclosed Friday that officials
have tentatively settled part of the case, which is considered one of
the nation's most important MTBE prosecutions.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say a significant verdict or settlement figure -- Arco
faces potential civil penalties in the tens of millions of dollars --
could influence similar cases across the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Michelle Lyman, who filed the case and managed
it for more than two years, said she resigned after being excluded
from settlement negotiations, which were taken over by Rackauckas and
a private law firm he hired. Lyman's departure is the latest in a
series of personnel shake-ups at the D.A.'s office during Rackauckas'
four years in office. Rackauckas declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Lyman said she is joining a new state agency that will send
experienced attorneys to help enforce environmental laws in rural
California counties.</TE>
<TE>   Lyman, an environmental prosecutor for 12 years who specializes in
gasoline storage contamination cases, said Rackauckas had prohibited
her from participating in settlement negotiations with Arco for at
least six months.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge declined Friday to modify bail conditions he imposed
earlier this year on an Iranian refugee indicted on charges of
soliciting donations at Los Angeles International Airport for an
organization on the State Department's list of terrorist
organizations.</LD>
<LD>   Without comment, U.S. District Judge Robert Takasugi dismissed a
prosecution motion that would have required Roya Rahmani to relocate
from Virginia to Southern California so she could be monitored more
closely. He also rejected a defense motion that would have allowed
her to travel more freely.</LD>
<LD>   Rahmani and six others were accused of raising money for the
Mujahedin-e Khalq, an Iraqi-based group dedicated to overthrowing the
government in Iran. In June, Takasugi dismissed the indictment on
grounds that the group had been denied due process when placed on the
State Department list. The government is appealing his ruling.</LD>

<LD>A man who strangled his 14-year-old stepdaughter on Valentine's Day
2001 in retaliation for his rejection by the girl's mother has
pleaded guilty to first-degree murder.</LD>
<LD>   Juan Pablo Gonzalez, 29, admitted Wednesday that he killed Roxana
Gonzalez, and the judge immediately sentenced him to 25 years to life
in prison. He could have faced the death penalty or life in prison
without possibility of parole if convicted on charges of murder,
burglary and sexual assault.</LD>
<LD>   Juan and Rosa Gonzalez had a turbulent marriage, and were
estranged when Roxana was killed, investigators said. In the weeks
before the strangulation, Juan Gonzalez stalked Rosa Gonzalez, once
threatening that he would harm her children if she did not take him
back, court records show.</LD>

<HD>For O.C. Buddhists, a Timely Temple</HD>
<DH>Spacious Pao Fa opens today, a landmark in the religion's
growth in a diverse region.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Lobdell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just a few feet from Southern California's newest Buddhist temple, a
six-lane boulevard carries harried business commuters in Irvine past
a blur of low-rise industrial buildings. The temple's Far East
architecture is intriguing enough to motorists that they stop in and
ask: When does this Japanese restaurant open?</LD>
<LD>   The confusion is understandable. No one in these parts has ever
seen anything like the $5-million Pao Fa Buddhist Temple, Orange
County's first mega-temple. It's 41,000 square feet of prayer halls,
8-ton jade Buddhas, classrooms, a library, dining hall and 42-room
monastery.</LD>
<LD>   And this morning, after nearly five years of construction, an
expected crowd of 3,000 will get the first public peek inside during
an open ceremony that mixes elements of the East and West with the
consecration of the Buddhas, recitation of sacred readings, and the
singing of "The Star Spangled Banner."</LD>
<TE>   "We don't have a big temple like this from Orange County down to
San Diego," said May Wen, chair of the South Coast Chinese Cultural
Assn., an Irvine-based group devoted to educating immigrants and
their children. "This temple will touch a lot of people."</TE>
<TE>   Even in the days leading up to its opening, the mood within the
temple has been established. In the main prayer hall, wisps of smoke
from incense ascend to the 4,000 golden Buddhas lining three upper
walls of the enormous sanctuary. On the 71-foot-long wooden altar
near the far wall sit three 8-ton statues, carved from solid white
jade.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty monks, nuns and volunteers kneel for their evening prayers
-- chanting in ancient cadences punctuated by a drum, bell and gong
for more than an hour. Though work crews still hammer, saw and drill
here and there, life inside the largest Buddhist temple in Orange
County already reflects the serene countenance of its abbot and
founder, Venerable Master Jen-Yi.</TE>
<TE>   "The secret is to not have too many expectations," said Jen-Yi, a
66-year-old Buddhist monk who was born in Taiwan and speaks through a
translator. "We knew we were going to have obstacles going in."</TE>
<TE>   Delays in construction were caused by Jen-Yi's extensive travel to
two sister temples in Taiwan that slowed decisions and also by
problems generated when temple designs didn't match with city
building codes. Jen-Yi said the $5 million raised for the
construction and $1 million spent acquiring the 3.2-acre lot in 1995
came from members of the two temples in Taiwan he helped to start.</TE>
<TE>   The Pao Fa temple is a significant addition to Orange County's
religious landscape, another acknowledgment of the maturing of a
diversity of faiths that in recent years has spawned plans for a new
Roman Catholic cathedral, a large mosque and Muslim community center,
a Mormon temple and a $65-million Jewish community center.</TE>
<TE>   "I get a sense of a new Buddhism emerging in America" that is
becoming more integrated into the general community, said Benjamin J.
Hubbard, chairman of the comparative religion department at Cal State
Fullerton. "There's a desire of Buddhists to put a [public] face on
their faith, and now's a good time with religious pluralism no longer
the exception and religious tolerance quite high."</TE>
<TE>   For many Orange County Buddhists, especially those reared on the
Chinese-influenced version of the faith, it means the end to long
commutes to large temples in Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Frank Yow, a retired chemist who lives in Laguna Niguel, often
drove to temples in Monrovia or Hacienda Heights for a day of
meditation. But he has found the Pao Fa temple to be a perfect place
to calm his mind.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter what, you get a cool feeling by stepping inside," Yow
said. "You cool down your body and your mind."</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County mega-temple is not related to another large
temple in Hacienda Heights that's also run by Taiwanese monks and
nuns. The Hsi Lai Temple is called the largest Buddhist temple in the
Western hemisphere. The $10-million, 60,000-square-foot building sits
on 14 acres of hillside property.</TE>
<TE>   "In my opinion the size of the place is not that important," Yow
said. "It's the people in charge. And [Jen-Yi], I saw him several
times, and he's very friendly and approachable."</TE>
<TE>   Orange County, with its large Asian immigrant communities, is home
to many smaller temples, most reflecting how the Buddhist faith is
practiced in the homelands of their members. Among the largest and
oldest is the 900-member Orange County Buddhist Church in Anaheim, a
temple founded in 1965 by Japanese immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   The Pao Fa temple reflects a form of Mahayana Buddhism, one of the
main branches of the faith. The goal of Buddhism is to end personal
suffering and the suffering of others through discipline,  meditation
and wisdom.</TE>

<HD>Dow W. Carpenter, 75; Retired Senior Vice President of
Times Mirror</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dow W. Carpenter, a retired senior vice president of Times Mirror Co.
who oversaw its book and magazine publishing operations during much
of his career, died Tuesday while vacationing in Kennebunkport,
Maine. He was 75, and suffered from heart disease.</LD>
<LD>   In the early 1960s, while he was a consultant with the management
consultant firm of McKinsey &amp; Co., Carpenter worked with Times Mirror
Chairman Norman Chandler and others in developing Times Mirror's
strategy as one of the first diversified media companies.</LD>
<LD>   Carpenter joined Times Mirror, the former parent company of the
Los Angeles Times, in 1964, and a year later became president of two
of Times Mirror's graphic products subsidiaries. Times Mirror was
purchased by the Tribune Co. in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Beginning in 1972, Carpenter held a variety of executive positions
at Times Mirror, including chief financial officer, before retiring
as a senior vice president in 1987. He spent much of his tenure
overseeing Times Mirror's book and magazine publishing operations,
its cable television business and other activities.</TE>
<TE>   "Dow Carpenter was a remarkably talented executive who contributed
a great deal to the growth of the Times Mirror Co.," said Robert F.
Erburu, chairman of Times Mirror until 1995. "Dow's personal
qualities were deeply appreciated by his colleagues."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Los Angeles, Carpenter graduated from Stanford University
in 1950. After serving in the Navy during the Korean War, he
graduated from Stanford's business school in 1955. He joined the
fledgling Ramo Wooldridge Co. -- later TRW -- before moving to
McKinsey &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Carpenter is survived by his wife, Dian, of Inverness, Calif.; two
daughters, Karen Carpenter of Mendocino and Carolyn Fox of Inverness;
and two grandchildren. Services will be private.</TE>
<TE>   In lieu of flowers, the family requests that contributions be made
to the Foundation for Cardiac Research, P.O. Box 1728, El Cerrito, CA
94530.</TE>

<HD>Bystander Killed by Gunfire on Street</HD>
<DH>Stray bullet hits woman a block away as man shoots at two
men in a car in Jefferson Park area. Police say attack may be
gang-related.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A woman bystander was killed by a stray bullet during a shooting
attack in the Jefferson Park area Friday afternoon, Los Angeles
police said.</LD>
<LD>   Det. Lt. Don Richards said the incident, which may have been
gang-related, began about 3:10 p.m. when a man stepped into the
street at Jefferson Boulevard and Farmdale Avenue and started
shooting at two young men in a car headed north on Farmdale.</LD>
<LD>   The car turned east on Jefferson, glancing off an MTA bus and
spinning out of control, Richards said.</LD>
<TE>   The gunman continued to fire, police said, and a bullet aimed at
the car struck a woman standing in front of a liquor store about a
block east on Jefferson.</TE>
<TE>   The woman, wounded in the chest, died a short time later at a
nearby hospital, police said. Her name was not released.</TE>
<TE>   After spinning out, the car sped west on Jefferson, police said.
The gunman fired more shots, officers said, and the car crashed into
a fence about a block farther west on Jefferson. Police said the
gunman escaped.</TE>
<TE>   The men in the car, who were not identified, were hospitalized
with injuries, apparently bullet wounds, that were not thought to be
life-threatening, Richards said.</TE>
<TE>   The bus was not seriously damaged, and no one in it was injured,
he said.</TE>

<HD>Council Urged to Act on Ethics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Ethics Commission asked the City Council on Friday to
end more than a year of delays and impose rules that would bar
elected officials from acting on city matters involving lobbyists and
contractors who help them raise campaign money.</LD>
<LD>   In urging quick action, Commission President Miriam Krinsky cited
concerns about the $8 million raised so far in the secession
campaigns. Mayor James K. Hahn and City Council members have together
raised about $6.5 million to fight San Fernando Valley and Hollywood
secession measures, with much of the money coming from city
contractors and lobbyists.</LD>
<LD>   "Certainly some of concerns raised by the public regarding
fund-raising involving secession does indicate the public would want
rules in place that eliminate even the perception of influence over
decision-making," Krinsky said.</LD>
<TE>   An anti-secession committee formed by City Councilwoman Cindy
Miscikowski has enlisted City Hall lobbyist Steven Afriat to raise
funds.</TE>
<TE>   A recent fund-raiser for the committee was hosted by Sunshine
Canyon Landfill lobbyist Arnie Bergoff, billboard industry lobbyist
Ken Spiker Jr. and cable industry lobbyist Maureen Kindel.</TE>
<TE>   The Ethics Commission voted Aug. 31, 2001, to ask the council to
prohibit elected officials from acting on matters handled by a
lobbyist who has directly contributed or helped raise more then
$1,000 for the official in the previous 12 months.</TE>
<TE>   The rules would also bar council members and the mayor from acting
on matters involving city contractors who have contributed more than
$1,000 in the previous 12 months.</TE>
<TE>   The commission recommended that the rules also apply to any
campaign committee the officials control, including those for ballot
measures such as the Nov. 5 secession proposals.</TE>
<TE>   But council members have indicated they will not extend the rules
to committees for ballot measures. The issue has been stalled in the
council's Rules and Elections Committee for about 14 months.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to the council Friday, the commission said: "As public
concern has continued to grow during these intervening months about
the large sums of money that are being raised by lobbyists and
contractors who have business before the public agencies and
officials they attempt to influence, the importance of the [proposed
ethics rules] have only been reinforced."</TE>
<TE>   The letter also said the rules, "would help foster trust by
limiting the potential for undue access and influence of lobbyists"
on elected officials.</TE>
<TE>   Council President Alex Padilla, who chairs the Rules and Elections
Committee, said he has not intentionally bottled up the
recommendation. He said he is awaiting additional information from
Chief Legislative Analyst Ron Deaton.</TE>
<TE>   Deaton said he is reviewing alternatives and hopes to report back
to the committee in December. He said the language of the proposed
rules is complicated and he does not want to offer the committee a
"shoot-from-the-hip analysis" of it.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla's own anti-secession committee has received contributions
from city contractors, including the public relations firm Fleishman
Hillard and lobbyists Al Avila and Kindel. But Padilla said the money
does not influence his decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "These are all people who agree we should keep the city of Los
Angeles together," Padilla said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the commission released new secession contribution
reports Friday. The campaigns are required to report any new
contributions of more than $1,000 within 24 hours of receiving them.
The reports show that Hahn's anti-secession committee received
$392,000 worth of air time from Univision Communications Inc., a
Spanish-language television network.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood Independence Committee Chairman Gene La Pietra gave
$41,000 more to his campaign, and Studio City lawyer David Fleming
contributed $25,000 to the Valley cityhood effort.</TE>

<HD>Mourners Overflow Funeral of Teen Allegedly Slain Over
Sexual Identity</HD>
<DH>Family, friends and strangers join at service for Eddie
'Gwen' Araujo, a 17-year-old boy who lived as a female.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rone Tempest</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEWARK, Calif. -- Hundreds of friends, family and sympathizers from
across California gathered in this working-class Bay Area suburb
Friday to mourn the brutal killing of the 17-year-old youth whom some
knew as Eddie and others, as Gwen.</LD>
<LD>   "We were really close. We are here to show that we loved him,"
said Stephanie Bauman, 17, a friend who wore gossamer angel wings to
the funeral service at St. Edwards Church. More than 500 mourners
overflowed the sanctuary on a beautiful, sunny fall afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   Eddie Araujo, who also used the first names "Gwen" and "Lida,"
disappeared Oct. 3 after attending a party in a Newark home. His
battered body, still garbed in a woman's party dress, was unearthed
two weeks later in the Sierra foothills. Three Bay Area men have been
charged with the murder under California hate-crime statutes.</LD>
<TE>   At the overflowing church, family members spoke of their love for
the gentle child who was allegedly murdered only a few blocks away.
The accused killers were allegedly enraged after discovering that the
beautiful girl at their party was biologically male.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always had a fascination for angels," said Sylvia Guerrero,
the slain youth's mother, at the church service. "I now know why:
because angels don't have gender."</TE>
<TE>   The theme of the service was the butterfly, Araujo's favorite
symbol. The oak casket was adorned with a large cloth butterfly and
bunches of flowers.</TE>
<TE>   "Take your flight, beautiful butterfly. Take your flight," said
Araujo's aunt Imelda Guerrero in her short, emotional eulogy.</TE>
<TE>   The killing has attracted national attention and has become a
rallying point for the gay and transgender community.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to show our support because we are also transgendered,"
said Christopher Robin, 32, who came to the funeral from Santa Cruz
with his partner, Jennifer Names, 40. "We came here because we suffer
regular harassment in Santa Cruz. This could have happened to either
one of us."</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Cruz couple, who legally changed their names to match
their transgendered identity, were among hundreds of gay, lesbian and
other mourners who viewed Araujo in an open casket at the Fremont
Memorial Chapel Mortuary before the funeral service.</TE>
<TE>   "I came here because I've been gay for 70 years and have had my
share of bad times," said Chris, 73, of Fremont, who asked that his
last name not be used because "I'm still in the closet because I have
kids."</TE>
<TE>   But not all or even most of the mourners were gay. They included
students from local high schools and workers from nearby communities.
Some were drawn to the scene by reports that fundamentalist Christian
protesters were also coming.</TE>
<TE>   Draped in an American flag and wearing Oakland Raiders wristbands,
Michael Mills, 35, a plumbing contractor from Oakland, said he was at
the funeral at the request of his 30-year-old transgendered sister,
who lives in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Some mourners came carrying signs with political messages. "Judge
me not for what I am but for WHO I am," said one. Several teenage
girls wore T-shirts inscribed: "We really love you underneath it
all."</TE>
<TE>   At his mother's request, Araujo's body was clad in a dark dress in
the casket. At one point as the hundreds of mourners passed in front
of the casket, Araujo's maternal grandmother collapsed and required
medical attention.</TE>
<TE>   The media swarm around the case has surprised this mostly
immigrant area between Oakland and San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an event that, although tragic, is unusual because it
happened in this part of the Bay Area," said Steve Ehlers, 53, a
construction worker from Fremont who was standing across the street
from the funeral home.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the Catholic church Friday, those who could not get into
the service softly sang "Amazing Grace." Drama students at Newark
High School arrived in angel costumes.</TE>
<TE>   The students are performing in "The Laramie Project," based on the
murder of University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard. The play was
already in production before Araujo was killed.</TE>
<TE>   Others carried banners and signs proclaiming "God Loves Gwen" and
"Live Free, Die Free."</TE>
<TE>   An anti-gay Kansas preacher and his congregation, which had
threatened to demonstrate at the church service, did not attend.</TE>
<TE>   But the two ministers who presided over the service warned that
Araujo's death should not be converted into hate.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people out there against what you are gathering here
for," said parish priest Father Jeff Finley. "Let's love them, too.
Otherwise, what is not understood about other people becomes
violent."</TE>

<HD>Leonard I. Green, 68; L.A. Opera Chief, Master of Friendly
Takeover</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis McLellan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leonard I. Green, founder and partner of the West Coast's largest
leveraged buyout firm and chairman of the board of the Los Angeles
Opera, has died. He was 68.</LD>
<LD>   Green died Friday of complications from heart surgery in Venice,
Italy, where he was on vacation.</LD>
<LD>   Known as a pioneer in the friendly takeover, Green co-founded a
New York investment banking partnership in 1969 -- Gibbons, Green,
van Amerongen -- that specialized in management-led, nonhostile
leveraged buyouts</LD>
<TE>   Green opened a California office of the firm in 1980, then left
the company in 1989 to establish his own Los Angeles-based firm:
Leonard Green &amp; Partners. Among the companies the firm acquired were
Carr-Gottstein Foods Co., Australian Resources Limited, Big 5
Sporting Goods and Thrifty Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a true pioneer of the management buyout industry," Peter
J. Nolan, one of the firm's partners, said Friday. "Leonard was an
instinctive, decisive investor and was able to spot unique investment
opportunities starting in 1969."</TE>
<TE>   Nolan described Green as "a very low-key, private individual, very
involved in civic and philanthropic activities" and said that "opera
was his passion."</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, Green became a founding director of the Los Angeles Opera
and served as its president and chief executive from 1998 to 2001,
when he was elected chairman. He oversaw a doubling of donations from
$8.5 million in 1998 to $17.7 million this year and personally gave
more than $2 million. In 1998, he helped recruit tenor Placido
Domingo as artistic director.</TE>
<TE>   "Leonard Green was a true role model of big business being married
to the arts," Domingo said in a statement Friday. "His love for opera
was real and deep, and he inspired others in the world of business
and finance to join him in his aim to support culture.... The arts
have lost a real champion."</TE>
<TE>   "If you came up with the half-dozen most important people in
establishing opera in L.A., Leonard would be on that list," Los
Angeles Opera President and Chief Executive Marc Stern told The Times
Friday. "His influence was really extraordinary, in terms of his
leadership, in terms of his generosity."</TE>
<TE>   Green was a member of the board of the Music Center of Los Angeles
County.</TE>
<TE>   As chronicled in a Times story in January, Green had endured
difficult times in recent years, including a boardroom coup by his
partners, Internal Revenue Service scrutiny of a Cayman Islands tax
shelter, and a divorce battle with his third wife that laid bare his
personal finances and business dealings.</TE>
<TE>   Green met his wife, Jude, a Michigan physical therapist, during an
Aspen, Colo., ski trip in 1994. They were married in 1995, and in
June 2000 Green filed for divorce.</TE>
<TE>   In what has been characterized as acrimonious divorce proceedings,
court records and other documents obtained by The Times showed that
the couple fought over access to Green's private Gulfstream II jet,
the use of an Aspen-area vacation house, the ownership of paintings
by John Singer Sargent and Marc Chagall, and her demand for $500,000
a month for spousal support, including an $83,000 allowance for furs
and jewelry.</TE>
<TE>   A breach-of-contract suit filed by Jude Green, in which she
claimed that Green had promised to provide lifetime financial
support, was dismissed in May, said Leonard Green's attorney, Dale F.
Kinsella.</TE>
<TE>   Green also sued his ex-wife -- for $25 million for defamation. The
suit was to proceed to trial after the conclusion of the financial
portion of the couple's divorce proceeding, set for trial in January.</TE>
<TE>   In the suit, Green contends that Jude Green's insider-trading
allegation against him damaged his reputation and harmed business
relations with his partners. He asserted that it added pressure to
sign a succession agreement that cut him out of future investor
funds.</TE>
<TE>   The Times reported in January that, according to depositions, the
partners concluded that the claim was untrue after two associates
interviewed Jude Green in her Bel-Air home and checked trading
records.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, according to the Times story, records provided
details of a boardroom struggle within Green's firm over his decision
to invest $300 million of client funds in the financially troubled
Rite Aid drugstore chain despite his partners' misgivings about the
company's financial standing and a potential conflict of interest
involving Green.</TE>
<TE>   His business partners told The Times in January that they had
since made peace with Green.</TE>
<TE>   A Philadelphia native, Green earned a bachelor's degree in
economics from Cornell University in 1955 and an MBA from the
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton Graduate School in 1956. In
1965, he received a law degree from Loyola University in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his daughter Suzanne, his son Steven, and a
grandson.</TE>
<TE>   Services are pending.</TE>

<HD>Richard Harris, 72; Irish Actor Described as an Icon and a
Giant of the Old School</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert W. Welkos and Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard Harris, the irascible, craggy-faced, Irish-born actor perhaps
best known as King Arthur in the 1967 film musical "Camelot" and more
recently as the wise old wizard headmaster Albus Dumbledore in the
first two "Harry Potter" films, died Friday in a London hospital. He
was 72.</LD>
<LD>   Harris, who in earlier years forged an image as a hard-drinking
hell-raiser in the style of fellow actors Richard Burton and Peter
O'Toole, died at University College of London Hospital. He reportedly
suffered from Hodgkin's disease, although a cause of death was not
immediately released.</LD>
<LD>   "With great sadness, Damien, Jared and Jamie Harris announce the
death of their beloved father, Richard Harris," read a statement from
his family that was released by the hospital. The statement said
Harris died "peacefully."</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, "Harry Potter" director Chris Columbus and producer
David Heyman said at a news conference that they had recently visited
Harris in the hospital and he appeared to be fighting back. The
second adaptation of the J.K. Rowling series of fantasy children's
books, "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," in which Harris
also played Dumbledore, opens Nov. 15, and the third is scheduled to
start filming next year.</TE>
<TE>   Harris "did threaten to kill me if I recast [Dumbledore]," said
Columbus. As of late Friday, Warner Bros. had made no decisions on
who would replace him.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent interview, Heyman said one of the best things about
"The Chamber of Secrets" was that Harris was able to have more fun
with his character.</TE>
<TE>   "In the first film, we didn't get as much of that glint in
Dumbledore's eye," Heyman said. "In the second one, you get a sense
of just how deep a character he is, that he knows exactly what's
going on. And Richard Harris is, of course, just perfect in the
role."</TE>
<TE>   The news of Harris' death was greeted with sadness among his
friends and colleagues in the entertainment industry.</TE>
<TE>   "Richard was wonderful to work with," said Clint Eastwood, who
directed Harris in Eastwood's 1992 Academy Award-winning film,
"Unforgiven." "A slightly mad Irishman and a truly gifted performer.
His presence on the set during the filming of 'Unforgiven' always
gave us a much-needed lift during the many hours of difficult work."</TE>
<TE>   Ridley Scott, who directed Harris in the Oscar-winning 2000 epic
"Gladiator," said Harris "was one of the giants of the old school."
The actor played Emperor Marcus Aurelius.</TE>
<TE>   Scott said Harris and cast mate Oliver Reed, who died while
filming "Gladiator," "came out of a generation that worked hard and
played hard." He called Harris, O'Toole and Burton "icons" and added,
"There aren't a lot of icons left."</TE>
<TE>   Randa Haines, who directed Harris in the 1993 drama "Wrestling
Ernest Hemingway," described him "as just one of those forces of
nature. Every moment of debauchery was in his face, and every moment
of his lust for life was written into his face. But that kind of
person, you can't imagine the world without them. You feel they will
go on forever."</TE>
<TE>   Harris himself once said that "a great actor walks on the stage
and he fills it from the right proscenium all the way to the back,
but some people get on and they are invisible." No one would have
dared call Harris invisible.</TE>
<TE>   With his auburn hair, blue eyes and a distinctive face that he
once described as looking like five miles of bad Irish road, Harris
became an international star on the strength of such performances as
his Oscar-nominated role as a crude, rough-and-tumble rugby player in
1963's "This Sporting Life," a strong but sensitive King Arthur in
"Camelot" and a wealthy Briton kidnapped and tortured by Sioux
Indians who eventually is embraced by the tribe in 1970's "A Man
Called Horse."</TE>
<TE>   He also had a parallel career as a singer in the 1960s. He scored
a huge hit with Jimmy Webb's "MacArthur Park," in which he crooned,
"Someone's left my cake out in the rain."</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Reynolds, who directed him in "The Count of Monte Cristo,"
which was released this year, recalled Harris as "just a master of
subtlety and nuance. He knew just the right turn of phrase, and he
could do it in just one or two takes."</TE>
<TE>   He was one of a new breed of British actors who were born out of
the renaissance of London theater in the 1950s, including Burton,
O'Toole, Reed, Albert Finney and Alan Bates -- actors who embodied
England's postwar angry young men. All of them went on to star in
films, and many of them were more known for their offstage antics
than for their screen roles.</TE>
<TE>   Stories abounded for years about Harris and his churlish behavior
to others on film sets and in the theater. Don Gregory, who
co-produced the tour of the stage musical "Camelot," in which Harris
performed intermittently from 1981 to 1985, recalled getting into a
scuffle on the sidewalk outside the Winter Garden Theater in New
York, where the production was being filmed for HBO.</TE>
<TE>   Gregory recalled Friday that Harris showed up three hours late and
"I got aggravated," after which Harris stormed out of the theater.
Gregory followed him and fell into a fight that was literally "in the
gutter."</TE>
<TE>   Six months later, Gregory went to Harris' dressing room in London
to make amends, and "he threw his arms around me and said, 'Let's
have dinner.' "</TE>
<TE>   Meg Bussert, who played Guenevere opposite Harris in "Camelot" in
the early '80s on Broadway, noted that "he could be difficult," but
added that "he really knew what he wanted on stage [and] was as kind
as he could be to the ensemble and the entire company."</TE>
<TE>   Early in his movie career, he refused to take a fall when Marlon
Brando punched him weakly in the 1962 remake of "Mutiny on the
Bounty," and he had a publicized falling out with director
Michelangelo Antonioni in the 1965 drama "Red Desert."</TE>
<TE>   "I was called an angry young man, but I had women camped out in my
garden," Harris said earlier this year. "I couldn't have been
happier."</TE>
<TE>   Uli Edel, who directed him this past summer in the upcoming TNT
miniseries "Caesar," saw the milder side of the aging lion.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very well-prepared, and he never showed any signs of
frailty," Edel said. "He was full of humor."</TE>
<TE>   But Harris retained his very public disdain for Hollywood to the
end. He was invited to join fellow actors Ian McKellen and Judi Dench
as presenters at this year's Academy Awards but turned it down,
saying, "Fourteen hours to get there, 10 hours talking ... and 14
hours back. I would rather spend that time in the pub talking to my
mates," according to the Times of London.</TE>
<TE>   Born Richard St. John Harris on Oct. 1, 1930, in Limerick, he was
the youngest son of a flour mill owner, Ivan Harris, and his wife,
Mildred.</TE>
<TE>   Harris excelled in sports in school and twice broke his nose
playing rugby. He was out of action for 2 1/2 years when he was
stricken in late adolescence with tuberculosis. While recuperating,
he began to read and write poetry.</TE>
<TE>   It was upon reading the books by Russian director Konstantin
Stanislavsky that Harris decided on pursuing a career on the stage,
though initially he wanted to direct.</TE>
<TE>   After training at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts
and Joan Littlewood's International Theatre Workshop, he made his
first professional appearance in 1956 in the Littlewood production of
Brendan Behan's "The Quare Fellow" at the Theatre Royal in Stratford.</TE>
<TE>   His first film role was a small part in a comedy titled "Alive and
Kicking." Far more memorable were his next two films in 1959, "Shake
Hands With the Devil" with James Cagney and "The Wreck of the Mary
Deare" with Gary Cooper and Charlton Heston.</TE>
<TE>   Harris' first starring role was in Lindsay Anderson's "This
Sporting Life," in which he electrified critics as Frank Machin, a
Yorkshire miner who becomes a rugby star. Besides receiving his first
Oscar nomination for the film, he won the best actor award at the
Cannes Film Festival.</TE>
<TE>   In subsequent years, he would star in such films as "The Bible,"
"Hawaii," "The Molly Maguires," "Robin and Marian" and "The Field,"
for which he received his second Oscar nomination.</TE>
<TE>   But Harris was brutally honest about the quality of most of his
films.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, his movie choices were appalling. "I drifted from
one piece of crap to another," he told The Times in 1990. These
included "Orca, the Killer Whale," "Tarzan the Ape Man," "The Wild
Geese" and "Return of a Man Called Horse."</TE>
<TE>   "If I was ever miscast in my life, it was in the role of husband,"
he recalled with a tinge of melancholy in his voice two years ago.
Both of his marriages were turbulent and ended in divorce, with both
wives complaining about his heavy drinking and weeks-long
disappearances.</TE>
<TE>   His first marriage, to Joan Elizabeth Rees Williams, daughter of a
Liberal peer in the House of Lords, lasted 12 years and produced
three sons. All three are in the movie industry: Two are actors and
one is a director. His second marriage, to actress-model Ann Turkel,
spanned seven years.</TE>
<TE>   Harris, a self-described "millionaire tramp," learned recently
that he was so rich he owned a Rolls-Royce he hadn't seen in nearly
three decades. Although he constantly asserted his Irishness, he
lived in his native country for only 90 days a year -- to minimize
his taxes. The rest of the time, he would travel among London's Savoy
Hotel, the U.S. and his beach home in the Bahamas.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1990 interview with The Times, Harris reflected on what it
was like becoming a star in the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a feeling none of us would last -- that it was just a
fine madness, an explosion of talented people who would probably burn
out.</TE>
<TE>   "But take a look -- Rod Stewart is still around, the Rolling
Stones, the fragmented Beatles. David Bailey. And the actors. O'Toole
is still there, Finney, Alan Bates. And me.... That's because we were
men of steel! We decided our own destinies."</TE>

<HD>Developers Back Prop. 51 With Eye on Irvine</HD>
<DH>Measure would divert vehicle-tax revenue to projects like
the Great Park. One group that got donations funded pro-Agran
mailers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Companies with development interests in Irvine have poured $300,000
into two groups backing a statewide measure that would redirect $1
billion a year in state vehicle-tax revenue to special projects --
including $110 million for the Great Park at El Toro.</LD>
<LD>   According to campaign finance reports updated Thursday, a dozen
local companies have donated since April to two groups pushing for
passage of Proposition 51, which is backed by Irvine Mayor Larry
Agran.</LD>
<LD>   One of the groups -- the Traffic Congestion Relief Initiative,
Proposition 51 Committee -- in turn donated $25,000 last month for a
flurry of slate mailers urging Irvine voters to support Agran and his
council allies in the Nov. 5 election.</LD>
<TE>   Irvine limits campaign contributions to $340 per donor, but there
are no limits on slate mailers, which are mass mailings that list
four or more candidates and ballot measures.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine mailers, called the Hometown Voter Guide, are produced
by longtime Agran ally Ed Dornan. They are distinctive because each
appears to be traditional campaign literature focusing on Irvine
politics. A listing of other races and measures is confined to a
portion of the back page.</TE>
<TE>   Dornan has defended the slate mailers as a legitimate way for
voters to be informed about candidates and issues. He couldn't be
reached Friday for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County supervisors recently clamped restrictions on "hit
slates" for countywide races. The new rules require candidates to pay
for the mailer if more than a quarter of the surface area supports
the candidates, targets an opponent, or if a candidate helps
coordinate the mailers.</TE>
<TE>   The slate mailers "are an end-run around contribution limits,"
said longtime campaign reform advocate Shirley Grindle of Orange.</TE>
<TE>   Dornan produced mailers for Agran's 2000 mayoral race and two
council candidates Agran supported. Dornan spent about $200,000, much
of which went unreported until after the election.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Greg Smith tried unsuccessfully this year to amend the
city's campaign laws to conform with the new county rules, and
criticized the Proposition 51 donation to Hometown Voter Guide.</TE>
<TE>   "This follows a pattern," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't violate the law, but there's a difference between law
and ethics."</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 51 has been the largest donor to the guide since the
March election. Agran and Councilwoman Beth Krom also each gave
$10,000 and candidate Mitch Goldstone gave $5,000 from their
campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Business donations to Proposition 51 include $45,000 from The
Irvine Co.; $50,000 each from Crow Winthrop Development and Colton
Properties, both of Irvine; and $25,000 each from William Lyon Homes
of Newport Beach, and from a limited partnership hoping to build
homes in the Irvine Business Center.</TE>
<TE>   Hometown Voter Guide has produced a half-dozen mailers in recent
weeks. Most are devoted to supporting Agran, Krom and Goldstone. They
also criticize mayoral candidate Mike House and council candidates
Chuck DeVore and Christina Shea -- Agran's predecessor as mayor.</TE>
<TE>   A yes vote on Proposition 51 is urged in five lines on the back
page. The only other issue listed is Irvine Measure GG, a repeal of
the city's utility tax that is opposed by Agran, Krom and Goldstone.

<HD>3 Leaders of Pyramid Scheme Convicted</HD>
<DH>Panorama City-based operation stole more than $2.5 million

<LD>The ringleaders of an elaborate pyramid scheme that stole more than
$2.5 million from working-class Latino families throughout Southern
California were found guilty Friday of multiple felonies, including
grand theft, securities fraud and tax evasion.</LD>
<LD>   Mercedes Navarette, 54, and her husband, Felix, 70, each face more
than 20 years in prison for their part in the scheme.</LD>
<LD>   Mercedes' daughter, Joan Frederick, convicted of grand theft and
"an endless chain scheme," could receive up to 15 years for operating
the telecommunications firm La Luz de Oro -- the "Light of Gold."</LD>
<TE>   All three are scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 20.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Superior Court verdict was read in a courtroom
packed with faithful company "members" who sobbed, prayed and
promised they would continue attending their pep rally-style
meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Other group leaders told the 50 or so followers at the trial not
to talk to reporters, but one woman, who declined to give her name,
offered a tearful response to the verdicts: "Injustice."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles police say as many as 16,000 people may have joined
the Panorama City-based company, lured by the promise of cars and
homes, and stirred by a sales pitch mixing Christian rhetoric, game
show theatrics and a celebration of working Latinos' bootstrapping
resolve.</TE>
<TE>   But in recent months up to 1,000 members complained to police that
they had received little or no reward for paying into a scheme that
required an endless supply of new members to fulfill its promises,
Det. John Rodriguez said.</TE>
<TE>   Members paid $75 to join the company and were required to attend
meetings and purchase long-distance telephone cards. They were told
they could share in the profits of the phone services and qualify for
free homes and cars if they persuaded others to join, police said.</TE>
<TE>   One popular program encouraged members to purchase autos,
suggesting that the company had paid for them when it had not,
Rodriguez said.</TE>
<TE>   At least 300 vehicles were eventually repossessed, wrecking credit
records of both the buyers and unwitting co-signers, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Another scheme promised $250,000 toward a "dream home" if members
gave the company at least $2,400.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez said the company helped only one woman buy a home, and
she is also charged in connection with the alleged scheme.</TE>
<TE>   Others were duped into signing their house deeds over to the
company, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Machinist Robert Ledea, in court to hear the verdict, said he and
his wife paid $5,000 into the program and worked full time for La Luz
de Oro as security guards. But he said they only received $100 in
return.</TE>
<TE>   A bank eventually foreclosed on Ledea's Huntington Park house
after he signed the deed over to La Luz de Oro, he said. Ledea said
he was happy with Friday's verdict.</TE>
<TE>   "They should pay, and the money should be given back to the people
who paid into the program," said Ledea, 52.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors seized about $2 million in company funds and plan to
redistribute the money among the victims. But they acknowledged it
would be difficult to determine who gets what.</TE>
<TE>   Seven others are awaiting trial on similar charges for their role
in the scheme. Their trial is set for Nov. 1.</TE>

<HD>Al Lerner, 69; Ohio Businessman Owned Cleveland Browns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Al Lerner, a billionaire who used his wealth from banking, real
estate and credit card giant MBNA Corp. to bring the NFL's Browns
back to Cleveland, died Wednesday in Cleveland, the team announced.
He was 69.</LD>
<LD>   Lerner, who was a leading philanthropist in the Ohio area,
underwent surgery in May 2001, reportedly to remove a brain tumor. In
June, he said that he had been in and out of the hospital over the
last year. The cause of his death was not immediately known.</LD>
<LD>   The Shaker Heights resident, a former furniture salesman, ranked
36th on Forbes magazine's 2002 list of the richest Americans, with a
net worth of $4.3 billion.</LD>
<TE>   Although chairman and chief executive of MBNA, the world's largest
independent credit card issuer, Lerner usually shunned the limelight.</TE>
<TE>   That changed when he was awarded the Browns' expansion franchise
in 1998 for $530 million, at the time the highest price paid for a
sports team.</TE>
<TE>   The purchase came three years after his longtime friend Art Modell
moved the original franchise to Baltimore. Lerner later served as
chairman of the NFL's finance committee and was regarded as one of
the league's most influential owners.</TE>
<TE>   The son of an immigrant candy shop owner, Lerner was born in
Brooklyn, N.Y. He earned a degree from Columbia College in 1955 and
then served in the Marines for two years as a pilot.</TE>
<TE>   His first job afterward was selling furniture. He earned $75 a
week.</TE>
<TE>   He saved enough to enter a deal to purchase a Cleveland apartment
building. His real estate empire steadily grew, and he went on to
acquire banking interests in Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   As a philanthropist, Lerner gave generously to hospitals and
universities. In June 2002, he and his family gave $100 million to
the Cleveland Clinic.</TE>
<TE>   A $25-million gift from Lerner helped pay for Columbia's Lerner
Hall, a student activities center. He gave $10 million, on behalf of
his wife, to University Hospitals of Cleveland to help provide the
hospital a new wing.</TE>
<TE>   He was president of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, which
oversees a medical complex with an international reputation. His gift
of $16 million to the clinic led to the 1999 opening of the Lerner
Research Institute.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Norma; a son, Randolph; a daughter,
Nancy; and seven grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Ventura Growth Initiative an Expensive Proposition</HD>
<DH>The measure's backers have spent more than $1.3 million to
sell voters on the plan. Opponents have raised about $194,000.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The most expensive growth measure in Ventura County history just
became more expensive.</LD>
<LD>   Supporters of Ventura's Measure A have spent more than $1.3
million promoting a plan that would allow 1,390 homes in the hills
and canyons above town.</LD>
<LD>   Campaign reports released Friday show that Lloyd Properties, the
family partnership that has owned the hillside land for a century,
has spent nearly $500,000 in just the past three weeks.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know quite what to say," said Martha Zeiher, a leading
opponent of the initiative. "It's an incredible amount of money, and
obviously there's no way we can get close to that."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents have raised about $194,000 since Jan. 1, the statements
show. That money, collected by the countywide group Save Open Space
and Agricultural Resources, is going toward campaigns in Simi Valley,
Santa Paula and Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   The bulk of SOAR's contributions -- $142,902 -- has been spent
trying to persuade Ventura voters to defeat Measure A, statements
show.</TE>
<TE>   Still, with most donations at $100 or less, the grass-roots group
is being outspent 10 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   "They're able to purchase a lot of access," Zeiher said. "My worry
is that people won't be getting our message."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents say the six neighborhoods allowed under the measure
would pour thousands of cars a day onto city streets, clog local
schools and erode hillsides.</TE>
<TE>   Margaret Merryman, spokeswoman for the initiative's supporters,
said the 300 landowners in the extended Lloyd family want to do
everything they can to help voters make an educated decision.
Development projects are complex, she said, and Measure A backers
have hired top consultants to answer the public's questions.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what it's taking to get the message out," Merryman said.
"The family also knows that in Ventura, spending the most money does
not guarantee one wins an election. Money has been what's required to
educate the public about this plan."</TE>
<TE>   Merryman said proponents have a second task: defending their plan
from attacks by a well-organized group of opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy, and inexpensive, to just say 'No,' " Merryman said.</TE>
<TE>   Developers and landowners are also pouring money into two other
growth measures on the Nov. 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   In Simi Valley, slow-growth activists want to tighten growth
boundaries approved by voters in 1998. They are fighting landowners,
businesses and city leaders who say current municipal boundaries halt
sprawl and allow for reasonable growth.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of Measure B, the boundary-tightening initiative, have
raised about $267,000, campaign statements show. About $182,000 of
that came from Unocal Corp., a major landowner in Simi Valley and
developer of a proposed housing project in one disputed canyon.</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Paula, an Arizona-based developer is bankrolling Measure
F, which would move the city's growth boundary to accommodate a
2,250-home project in nearby Adams Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   New spending figures were not available Friday, but as of Sept.
30, the developer had spent about $425,000 promoting the measure.</TE>

<HD>Students Deliver Scores for a Song</HD>
<DH>Counselor portrays 'Little Mermaid' after school's 66-point
spike in Stanford 9 results.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Karima A. Haynes</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It wouldn't be a stretch to say that Alex Bacos has a big heart --
and mouth to match.</LD>
<LD>   As a guidance counselor and testing coordinator at Madison Middle
School in North Hollywood, Bacos knew last May how hard it can be to
get 2,400 sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders to commit to anything,
let alone preparing for the Stanford 9 test.</LD>
<LD>   He needed a hook, a gag, a shtick -- something really over the top
-- to get his students pumped for pulling up their scores on the
three-day statewide exam.</LD>
<TE>   "Without even thinking, I said to the kids, 'If you raise your
test scores I will dye my hair red and sing the song from 'The Little
Mermaid,' " Bacos recalled.</TE>
<TE>   To his amazement, the kids went for the crazy stunt.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in September 2001, they studied vocabulary lists,
watched videos on test-taking strategies and came in on Saturdays for
tutoring. Teachers geared their instruction toward math, reading,
spelling and language skills the children would need on the test.</TE>
<TE>   Parents were told of the importance of the test through
newsletters, telephone calls and the school newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Madison's standardized test scores were among the lowest in the
Los Angeles Unified School District because most of its students are
from low-income families and have limited English proficiency,
administrators said.</TE>
<TE>   As a campus deemed underperforming by state education officials in
2000, Madison had to raise its score on the statewide Academic
Performance Index from 513 to at least 527 -- 14 points -- to avoid
possible censure.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew that this was a make-or-break year," Bacos said. "We had
to show improvement."</TE>
<TE>   Through the test period, Bacos said students committed to getting
enough rest, eating a good breakfast and embracing the unofficial
school motto: "Do your best on the test!"</TE>
<TE>   The moment of truth came earlier this month when Principal JoAnna
Kunes told the students that their API scores had soared 66 points --
nearly four times the goal and the biggest gain among middle schools
in the district.</TE>
<TE>   "These results were a well-deserved vindication for staff and
students who together ... [were] determined to disprove the
designation of Madison as an underperforming school," Kunes said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, there was one more score to settle.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday morning, after students jammed the school auditorium,
the school orchestra sounded the opening strains of "The Little
Mermaid" theme song. A spotlight shone as the curtain parted.</TE>
<TE>   There, among "rocks" against an ocean backdrop sat a
not-so-"Little Mermaid" stuffed into a skin-tight gold sequined

<TE>   Bacos belted out the tune with Broadway-style abandon, shimmied
across the stage and chatted with his audience, telling them, "You're
just clapping because I'm so pretty."</TE>
<TE>   As the song ended and the curtain closed, Kunes shouted, "Let's
hear it for Mr. Bacos' hairy underarms!" launching another wave of
catcalls.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think he was going to do it," said seventh-grader
Jennyfer Vilchez, shaking her head in disbelief.</TE>
<TE>   Classmate Tomas Valenzuela knew better: "Mr. Bacos always keeps
his promises."</TE>

<HD>Man Held in Stanton Robbery</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A man was arrested Friday after a gunman who knocked on the door of a
plumber's house in Stanton claiming to need help tried to rob the
plumber's wife, deputies said.</LD>
<LD>   Uegeno Perez, 25, was being held at the Orange County Jail on
suspicion of robbery. His last known address was in Phoenix, deputies
said.</LD>
<LD>   The attempted robbery occurred shortly after 10 a.m. when a man,
carrying a pipe and a duffle bag, knocked on the door of a home in
the 7000 block of Yorkshire Avenue that had plumbing-business trucks
parked in the driveway, the Orange County sheriff's deputies said.
The intruder told the woman who answered the door that he needed to
speak to her husband about a plumbing emergency. The woman said she
would call her husband at work.</LD>
<TE>   Seconds after she pressed the speed dial, the gunman pushed his
way into the house, knocked the phone out of her hand, tied her up
and demanded money, Sheriff's Department spokesman Jim Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   The husband heard the robbery over the phone and called deputies,
who apprehended Perez in front of the house. Police said Perez was
carrying a loaded .25-caliber handgun.</TE>

<HD>Monastery Memento Drives Home Importance of Knowing Your
Territory</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Members of the media who toured the new Pao-fa Buddhist monastery in
Irvine were given unlikely mementos that were inscribed with the
monastery's name: commuter mugs. Of course, driving is the one
religion common to everyone here.</LD>
<LD>   Words imperfect: My new concept for a sure-fire-hit TV suspense
series is "Missing Letters," which would follow the dramatic search
to repair these items in my collection (see photos), including:</LD>
<LD>   * A tire sign that inadvertently imparts a cheerful message (Nancy
Warrick of Costa Mesa).</LD>
<TE>   * Miles apart signs that add up to one Wells Fargo logo.</TE>
<TE>   * A devilish commentary on urban life.</TE>
<TE>   * And, finally -- in the category of Those Rascally Commuters Are
At It Again! -- a movie log from Dana Alexander of Santa Barbara in
which all the Ps are missing.</TE>
<TE>   Fore! I see where the Agriculture Department denied approval to a
company planning to sell a "bioengineered super grass" for golf
courses. Because weedkillers don't affect the stuff, the Associated
Press said, some environmentalists feared that the grass might escape
the golf courses, "wreak havoc on schoolyards and neighborhood lawns"
and be impossible to control.</TE>
<TE>   Such, interestingly enough, was the basic plot of "Greener Than
You Think," a 1947 novel by Ward Moore. The roots of the disaster
were in L.A., of course -- specifically, a frontyard in Hollywood
where a chemist soaked a dying lawn with an additive. The resulting
Bermuda grass spread with a vengeance "through the Cahuenga Pass ...
toward the fertile San Fernando Valley. Steadily it climbed to the
hilltops, masticating sage, greasewood, oak, sycamore and manzanita
with the same ease it bolted houses and pavements."</TE>
<TE>   Nothing stops it, not weed-burners, oil or even aerial bombing by
the National Guard. The devil grass eventually swamps the entire
nation. The Soviet Union attacks America, but its soldiers become
trapped in the weeds and starve. By book's end, the grass has jumped
to other nations, and most of Earth's inhabitants have taken to
living on the sea. I can't recall if the inventor of the additive was
a golfer, but I wouldn't be surprised.</TE>
<TE>   Understatement of the day: Bennett Mintz of Chatsworth spotted
this headline in an outdoors publication: "Lyme disease can spoil
your outdoor fun ... "</TE>
<TE>   New undertaking? The Monrovia-based Baseball Reliquary collects
offbeat baseball treasures such as a "fragment of skin purportedly
from the inner left thigh of [baseball pioneer] Abner Doubleday,
found in a refrigerator in the basement of the Hall of Fame in 1948
and apparently deemed to have been too disturbing for public
exhibition." The reliquary just announced its latest (less
sensational) find: the gold-plated shovel used by original Angel
owner Gene Autry during groundbreaking ceremonies for Anaheim Stadium
on Aug. 31, 1964.</TE>
<TE>   Fine, but with the Angels' World Series chances seemingly dying, I
hate to see any mention of a shovel in connection with the team.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Diana Steshko of Lake Forest came across an herbal
supplement that was billed as a "powerful men's performance
enhancer." The label warned that a user should first consult a doctor
"if you are pregnant." And then be sure to call the National
Enquirer.</TE>

<HD>Pivotal Election for Ventura County Farm Town</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Fred Alvarez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is one of the biggest political fights ever to hit Santa Paula, a
watershed election that could shape the small farm town's future and
restore some of the glories of years past.</LD>
<LD>   On Nov. 5, voters could install a new City Council majority, open
the door to large-scale development in remote Adams Canyon and
revolutionize the city's electoral process by agreeing to carve the
mostly Latino community into five voting districts.</LD>
<LD>   But all seven candidates agree there could be even more at stake.</LD>
<TE>   They say the election is about reversing the decline of a town
once known as a thriving business and cultural center, a place where
rows of stately Victorian homes and a picturesque Main Street still
beckon Hollywood filmmakers seeking to re-create a slice of
small-town America.</TE>
<TE>   The election is also about boosting Santa Paula's sagging economy,
which is reflected in its timeworn downtown. It is about stemming a
rising tide of crime -- Santa Paula was one of the few Ventura County
cities were crime was up last year, surging nearly 13% because of
sharp increases in robbery and theft.</TE>
<TE>   And it is about smoothing tensions, largely divided along racial
lines, that resulted two years ago in a U.S. Department of Justice
lawsuit alleging that the city's at-large voting system had
perpetuated racial discrimination by preventing Latino candidates
from being elected to the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   City leaders agreed last year to a settlement that included
letting voters decide whether to elect council members by district.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Laura Flores Espinosa, a longtime advocate for ethnic
diversity in Santa Paula government and the only Latino on the City
Council when the federal lawsuit was filed, is running for reelection
as a write-in candidate because she missed a filing deadline for
council incumbents.</TE>
<TE>   Espinosa is the only one of the seven candidates who favors
district elections.</TE>
<TE>   But all the candidates agree that the city needs to rejuvenate its
downtown, build a stronger tax base and provide more housing for
residents of all incomes.</TE>
<TE>   They differ, however, on how to achieve those goals, splitting
most noticeably into two camps over Measure F, an initiative that
would change the city's growth boundary, clearing the way for
development of up to 2,250 homes and condominiums in Adams Canyon
northwest of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Incumbent Rick Cook and candidates Al Escoto and Rita Graham
support the measure, arguing that it is the best way to pull Santa
Paula out of an economic nose dive that has made it difficult to pay
police officers competitive salaries and provide recreational
activities for children.</TE>
<TE>   Espinosa and candidates Gabino Aguirre, Mary Ann Krause and John
Wisda oppose the initiative, saying the best way to jolt Santa Paula
out of economic stagnation is to invest in the city core.</TE>
<TE>   "If Measure F passes, it will totally change the character of
Santa Paula," said Aguirre, 56, a 30-year resident of the city and
principal at the continuation high school in Moorpark.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of Ventura County seems to be up for grabs
development-wise," Aguirre added. "But I don't really see that Santa
Paula needs to go that way. I think there's plenty of room for growth
within the city."</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre said that one of his first priorities would be to embark
on a citywide "visioning process," gathering opinions from residents
and community groups to create a blueprint for how Santa Paula should
look decades from now.</TE>
<TE>   He also favors creating a mix of multistory shops and housing
units in and around the city's downtown.</TE>
<TE>   "Santa Paula, just like other small towns throughout the country,
is suffering from neglect," Aguirre said. "When I look down the road,
I think we are going to be the island in a sea of development and
that island is going to attract a lot of people."</TE>
<TE>   Cook, 52, said he favors Measure F because it is the best way to
generate money needed to improve parks, public safety and other city
services. The lifelong Santa Paula resident was elected to the
council four years ago and served on the Planning Commission five
years before that.</TE>
<TE>   "If Measure F doesn't pass, Santa Paula will just stay like it is,
because we have no money," said Cook, a retired Santa Paula police
officer who now works as an investigator with the Ventura County
public defender's office.</TE>
<TE>   He notes that a yes vote on Measure F doesn't approve development
in Adams Canyon but does allow city leaders to begin considering
development options. However, he said that building in the canyon
northwest of Santa Paula could bring good jobs, lure new industry,
increase the city's tax base and cure a variety of ills.</TE>
<TE>   "The city really is at a crossroads," Cook said. "If the wrong
people get elected, our city will be remembered as what used to be a
nice town but now is a ghost town."</TE>

<HD>Rainy Season Starts With Light Moisture in L.A.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not enough to shut down the national pastime. Not enough to open up
the national forest.</LD>
<LD>   That's the word on the rain that began lightly falling Friday
across the Los Angeles area and is expected to move out of the region
by this afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   There is a 40% chance of rain this morning, but it should taper
off before today's 5 p.m. start of Game 6 of the World Series at
Edison International Field in Anaheim.</LD>
<TE>   "Hopefully we won't see rain during the game," said Tim McClung, a
National Weather Service meteorologist. If there is rain, "I don't
believe there will be a delay in the game. And certainly no
cancellation."</TE>
<TE>   Barely measurable rainfall--in the hundredths of an inch--was
recorded at some sites around the Southland during the midafternoon
Friday. The moisture was enough to bring oil to the surface of
streets and freeways and cause a spate of fender-benders.</TE>
<TE>   But it was far short of the 2 inches needed to end the fire danger
in the Angeles National Forest and portions of the Cleveland, Los
Padres and San Bernardino national forests. Forest Service officials
have closed those areas to the public because of the hazard.</TE>
<TE>   "We have our raindrop counters out, and so far it's not really
pouring," said Robert Brady, an Angeles National Forest spokesman in
Arcadia, where Friday afternoon's rain was barely enough to wet the
streets.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd like to see one good storm spread out over two or three days
so it gets moisture that stays in the bushes and the ground. We don't
want it all at once. That wouldn't be good for the burn areas above
Glendora," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A deluge in 1960 that dropped about 5 inches of rain on
fire-scorched hillsides above the community over 12 hours caused
flooding and mudslides that damaged Glendora homes on several
streets, Brady said.</TE>
<TE>   Although weather experts Friday were watching Hurricane Kenna off
the coast of Mexico, forecasters predicted that it would veer east
and not affect Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight and Sunday should be partly cloudy, they said, but Sunday
night should be clear and Monday mostly sunny, except for coastal
areas, where there will be patchy morning clouds and fog.</TE>
<TE>   High temperatures should be in the 60s today, the 70s on Sunday
and about 80 on Monday, forecasters said.</TE>

<HD>Man Is Charged in String of Rapes and Kidnappings Across
the Valley</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An 18-year-old North Hollywood man was charged Friday with 17 felony
counts stemming from a series of abductions, rapes and other crimes
against women and girls across the San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Andrew Saethong, who is being held at the Twin Towers jail in lieu
of $15.1-million bail, will be arraigned Nov. 13 in Van Nuys Superior
Court, according to the Los Angeles County district attorney's
office.</LD>
<LD>   Saethong faces multiple life terms in prison if convicted on all
counts, which include kidnapping to commit rape, assault with intent
to commit rape, commission of a lewd act on a child, assault with
forcible rape, sodomy and oral copulation, prosecutors said.</LD>
<TE>   The charges stem from nine attacks between last Dec. 12 and Oct.
18 in areas covered by the Los Angeles Police Department's
Devonshire, Foothill and Van Nuys divisions.</TE>
<TE>   Saethong's victims ranged in age from 14 to 26, detectives said.
Five of the alleged victims were under 18.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent incident was reported Oct. 18, when a man in a
white Honda Accord approached a 14-year-old Monroe High student
walking to school in the 9000 block of Willis Avenue in North Hills.
She was allegedly offered a ride by a man identified by the victim as
Saethong, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The girl refused, prompting her assailant to drive farther up the
block. He parked his car and again approached the girl and then used
a knife or simulated a gun to force her into the car.</TE>
<TE>   The assault occurred in an alley about two blocks away, police
said.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives with the LAPD Robbery Homicide Division have
interviewed other possible victims and said additional charges could
be brought against Saethong.</TE>
<TE>   The attacks typically took place in the morning and early
afternoon, according to police. Police said the attacks showed a
pattern of escalating violence that began with kidnappings and later
included rapes.</TE>
<TE>   Police earlier this week released a composite sketch of the
assailant, described as an Asian man in his early 20s, 5 feet 3, 120
pounds, with brown eyes, black hair and pockmarked skin.</TE>
<TE>   Saethong, who is 5 feet 5, 120 pounds with black hair and brown
eyes, was arrested Wednesday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives said the break in the case came after the police
department released the sketch and received tips from at least two
dozen people from Whittier to Santa Clarita.</TE>

<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>Whether from the blessing of homosexual marriages by liberal bishops
in Canada and the United States, or plans by conservative adherents
in Australia to allow laypeople to preside at Holy Communion, the
worldwide Anglican Church is in danger of splitting into two camps,
warns the archbishop of Canterbury.</LD>
<LD>   "If people act precipitously, then the danger of there being a
real split, which I've been resisting all my ministry, will happen,"
Archbishop George Carey said. In Toronto to accept an honorary
doctorate, Carey, 67, reaffirmed his opposition to the unilateral
decision by a Greater Vancouver diocese to bless same-sex marriages.</LD>
<LD>   But Carey, who is stepping down later this month as titular head
of the world's Anglicans, said he is not anti-gay and conceded that
the church has been unfair to homosexuals.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel very saddened, because I come across very often to
homosexuals as very hard and doctrinaire, when I do understand their
predicament," Carey said. "I think the church has not behaved very
fairly in the past to homosexuals and has misunderstood them. So we
do need to find ways in which they are strongly affirmed as members
of the body of Christ.</TE>
<TE>   "On the other side, [homosexuals] need to understand that people
such as myself are keeping strongly to theological principles, [but]
that we're not against them as a people. I'm not homophobic at all,
but it may seem that. What we need to do is explore together and keep
in step with one another, but not [take] precipitous actions that
will endanger and deepen splits within the church.</TE>
<TE>   The recent unilateral move by evangelical Anglicans in Sydney,
Australia, to allow laypeople to preside over Holy Communion is as
threatening to church unity as gay activism, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue is not sexuality; it's how we handle disagreement. I
believe the issue of lay presidency is as major a problem as the
issue of sexuality," he said, "because it undermines the whole
concept of faith and order."</TE>
<TE>   A schism can be avoided "by Christian charity and sensitivity to
one another. Because we're all facing the same issues and challenges,
it's imperative that we maintain a healthy dialogue."</TE>

<HD>Officials Discriminated Against Jews, Court Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>PHILADELPHIA -- Officials in a New Jersey borough discriminated
against an Orthodox Jewish community when they refused to allow the
placing of plastic strips on utility poles to mark the boundaries of
a symbolic religious district, a federal appeals court ruled
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the borough of
Tenafly's argument that allowing the unobtrusive strips constituted
an improper government endorsement of religion.</LD>
<LD>   The strips mark an erub, a symbolic district within which Jews who
strictly observe religious laws are allowed to perform physical tasks
otherwise banned on the Sabbath. During the Sabbath, observant Jews
do not perform labor, and outside of an erub would not be allowed to
push baby carriages, use wheelchairs or carry packages.</LD>
<TE>   Most major American cities, including several in Southern
California, contain erubs, although many residents may not realize it
because they often are marked with easily overlooked strands of wire.</TE>
<TE>   Nathan Lewin, the attorney for the Orthodox community, called the
decision a victory for religious freedom.</TE>
<TE>   He also criticized Tenafly residents who said the erub would turn
the town into a magnet for Orthodox Jews.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not a preposterous notion to say that the existence of an
erub may make it more likely for an Orthodox Jew to live in a
neighborhood," Lewin said.</TE>
<TE>   "But that is fine, just like having a nice park or a good school
in a neighborhood is a fine way to attract people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Rosen, an attorney for the borough, said officials haven't
yet decided whether to appeal. He said officials are reviewing the
decision and declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The Tenafly erub encloses about one-third of the borough of
13,000, a few miles northwest of New York City.</TE>

<HD>Gay Rights Ordinance Divides Minister Groups</HD>

<DL>TACOMA, Wash</DL>
<LD>The Tacoma Ministerial Alliance, a predominantly black group of 35
ministers, wants a gay rights ordinance abolished, while the
Associated Ministries of Tacoma-Pierce County, a group of about 200
congregations, wants to preserve the law.</LD>
<LD>   The two sides are split over how to apply biblical teachings to
the issue.</LD>
<LD>   "I know that discrimination is wrong," said the Rev. Gregory
Christopher, pastor of Shiloh Baptist Church and a member of both
ministerial groups.</LD>
<TE>   "But I believe that the Bible teaches we have a choice whether
we're going to be heterosexual or homosexual," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. David Alger, executive director of Associated Ministries,
said that many members of his group believe that homosexuality is a
sin, but that they believe more strongly that discrimination is
wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "We're simply saying a person should not be denied any civil
rights based on their sexual orientation," Alger said.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council approved the ordinance in April, banning
discrimination against gays, lesbians, transvestites and people who
undergo sex changes.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 600 conservatives from mainline Protestant churches are
meeting in Indianapolis this weekend to attack liberal-leaning
denominations.</LD>
<LD>   Evangelical leaders say the denominations have abandoned Scripture
by embracing homosexuality, an anything-goes theology and causes such
as abortion and opposition to war with Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   "The Holy Spirit has not abandoned our churches; neither will we,"
a group of 18 theologians wrote in a joint "Letter to Confessing
Christians," released at the meeting of the Assn. for Church Renewal.</LD>
<TE>   "A church that is unable to confess its faith is a lame and
withered church," the letter said. "The church needs faithful
witnesses in order to be the church of Jesus Christ."</TE>
<TE>   The leader of the effort is Thomas Oden, a United Methodist
theologian from Drew University.</TE>
<TE>   Conference participants come from the United Church of Christ,
Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), American Baptist Churches USA
and the Methodist, Presbyterian, Lutheran and Episcopal churches.</TE>

<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>Roman Catholics are visiting a church in the small Texas town of
Devine in big numbers to see the statue of Our Lady of San Juan de
los Lagos.</LD>
<LD>   Msgr. Adolfo Valdivia Aguirre, pastor of St. Joseph's Catholic
Church, said his parish southwest of San Antonio could wind up
receiving 30,000 visitors while the visiting statue is on display.</LD>
<LD>   The statue is named for the town in the Mexican state of Jalisco
where the devoted believe that a young girl killed in an acrobatic
performance was miraculously brought back to life in the 1600s
through the Virgin Mary's intercession.</LD>
<TE>   The small, 350-year-old Virgin, with long, dark hair and flowing
blue robes, is a reproduction of the original image and has been
exhibited across the United States and Mexico, Aguirre said.</TE>

<DL>LYNCHBURG, Va.</DL>
<LD>The Rev. Jerry Falwell's Liberty University plans to open a law
school to train conservative lawyers who will defend religious
rights.</LD>
<LD>   "It is high time that we create a law school that will produce men
and women who are committed to the Judeo-Christian ethic, the
preciousness of human life and the defense of the Judeo-Christian
values that formed this great nation," Falwell said.</LD>
<LD>   The law school has been approved by Liberty's Board of Trustees
and is scheduled to open next fall, but it must still win
accreditation from state officials and the American Bar Assn., a
process that can take years.</LD>

<HD>Discovery Consistent With Bible, Editor Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The editor of a conservative Catholic magazine said the discovery of
a first-century stone box that could have held the bones of Jesus'
brother does not disprove church teaching on the perpetual virginity
of Mary.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers this week unveiled an ossuary, or stone box used to
hold the bones of the dead, with the inscription "James, son of
Joseph, brother of Jesus."</LD>
<LD>   Experts from the Biblical Archaeology Society believe that the
chances are strong that the inscription refers to the Jesus of the
Gospels.</LD>
<TE>   Catholics teach that Jesus' mother, Mary, remained a virgin after
his birth. They also teach that biblical figures like James, whom the
Bible refers to as a "brother" to Jesus, were actually cousins.</TE>
<TE>   But even so, the discovery would not prove that Mary had other
children and would not contradict the Catholic doctrine of the
perpetual virginity of Mary, said Deal Hudson, editor of Crisis
magazine,</TE>
<TE>   Hudson said a traditional teaching from Orthodox Christianity
could help explain the mystery.</TE>
<TE>   Orthodox Christians believe that Jesus' father, Joseph, had been
previously married, and that James was a product of that earlier
marriage.</TE>
<TE>   That teaching "might help to explain why [Joseph] was willing to
take on a young, consecrated virgin as his bride," Hudson wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "This would also make sense in light of Joseph's age. He
apparently was much older than Mary and died before Jesus began his
public ministry."</TE>
<TE>   Hudson's views were shared by the Rev. Joseph Fitzmyer, a biblical
expert at Catholic University, who was excited by the find but said
the Bible itself is unclear about Jesus' family relationships.</TE>
<TE>   He cited the gospel of Luke, which says Jesus "was the son, or so
it was thought, of Joseph."</TE>

<HD>Mix of Faiths Opposes War With Iraq</HD>
<DH>Coalition including Muslims, Christians and Jews calls
attack immoral and unwise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry B. Stammer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the debate continues over the Bush administration's policy toward
Iraq, religious leaders -- at least those from the liberal end of the
political spectrum -- are stepping up their opposition.</LD>
<LD>   Led by the Rev. George Regas of the Progressive Religious
Partnership, religious spokesmen in Los Angeles this week denounced
the prospect of a preemptive war against Iraq as "immoral, illegal
and unwise."</LD>
<LD>   "Rabbis, imams, priests, ministers and bishops -- a broad-based
religious coalition -- call on President Bush to meet the moral
obligations as leader of this nation under God," said Regas, rector
emeritus of All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena.</LD>
<TE>   The religious opponents of Bush's policy list a host of secular
reasons for their position: Iraq has not declared war on the U.S.;
there is no proven connection between Iraq and Al Qaeda terrorists; a
war would cost many innocent lives. Rabbi Steven Jacobs of Temple Kol
Tikvah in Woodland Hills said an attack on Iraq would inflict
"irreparable damage to Israel."</TE>
<TE>   But their religious beliefs are more central to their motivation,
the clergy members said.</TE>
<TE>   "This president and his advisors have been meditating on blood,
and the blast of war has been ringing in their ears," said Rabbi
Leonard Beerman, founding rabbi of Leo Baeck Temple in Los Angeles.
"As religious leaders of three faiths, we're here to attest that
there is another way."</TE>
<TE>   "I may be a liberal human being, but in faith, I'm very devoted.
In some ways I'm a conservative," said the Rt. Rev. J. Jon Bruno,
Episcopal bishop of Los Angeles. "This is not a political issue for
us, but a faith issue. This war would not be of God."</TE>
<TE>   Not all religious figures would agree with that statement. Richard
Land of the Southern Baptist Convention is among several prominent
Protestant figures -- mostly political conservatives -- who have
declared their support for Bush's policies. So has the Rabbinical
Council of America, a leading Orthodox group. The Union of American
Hebrew Congregations, an organization of Reform synagogues, has
conditionally supported Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Maher Hathout, spokesman for the Islamic Center of Southern
California, said Thursday that he had hoped even more religious
leaders would oppose a war on Iraq. But in the aftermath of the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks and the patriotic fervor that followed, Hathout
said it is difficult. "It's not only a matter of conviction but a
matter of courage," Hathout said.</TE>
<TE>   It is a dilemma that especially confronts Muslims, said Nazir
Khaja of the Islamic Information Service in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Mainline Christians are finding it hard to raise their voices as
well, said the Rev. Thomas C. Hill III, a ranking Southern California
official of the United Methodist Church.</TE>
<TE>   "The religious community is opposed to a war with Iraq, but many
of the persons in our congregations want to be supportive of our
nation," he said. "So for many of us, the dilemma is how to be
faithful to our God and at the same time supportive of our nation. No
one wants to appear anti-American, or anti-Bush administration."</TE>

<HD>Church Takes a Monumental Shape</HD>
<DH>The 85,000-square-foot Presbyterian facility going up in
Porter Ranch is considered a symbol of Koreans' religious fervor.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Atop a sloping hill in Porter Ranch, a gargantuan new home for a
Korean congregation is taking shape.</LD>
<LD>   The 85,000-square-foot Valley Christian Presbyterian Church, under
construction just north of the Ronald Reagan Freeway, is already a
landmark in a community sprouting from the dry hills of the northern
San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   To analysts of the Korean church, the $12-million project, which
is scheduled to be completed in March, symbolizes the religious
fervor of Korean immigrants, their willingness to make financial
sacrifices and their desire for recognition.</LD>
<TE>   "Because of our long history of oppression under the Japanese and
others, Koreans like big things; they strive to be No. 1," said
theologian Chung-Kuhn Lee, past president of the Council of Korean
Churches in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Lee, senior pastor of the Union Evangelical Holiness Church in
West Covina -- who also teaches Christian education at Azusa Pacific
University -- said it's not an accident that six of the world's 10
largest Christian congregations are in South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Porter Ranch, 40 miles from Los Angeles' Koreatown, may seem like
a remote setting for a 1,600-seat Korean immigrant mega-church. But
about 50,000 to 70,000 people of Korean descent live in the Valley,
the result of a steady migration since the 1980s out of central city
neighborhoods and into suburbs, according to estimates from Korean
community, church and business groups. The church will be the largest
of roughly 100 Korean churches in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   To church members, the 14-acre site, bordered by a running stream
and a grove of willows and oaks, is the promised land, an answer to
prayers.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day for the past 15 years, we have gathered for prayer at
dawn," said Jae-Jo Lee, a founding member of Valley Christian
Presbyterian, which has worshiped in a rented Lutheran church in the
east Valley neighborhood of Arleta since 1988.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, after years of negotiations, the church acquired the
Porter Ranch parcel from the city of Los Angeles in exchange for 54
acres of rocky hills several miles farther west that the city needed
to expand a park. In return for the parkland, the city gave the
church 14 acres and $2.8 million in Proposition A bond money.</TE>
<TE>   Senior pastor Jae-Youn Kim, 56, described as "visionary" by
supporters and "overly ambitious" by detractors, has big plans for
the facility, which is across from the Porter Ranch town center
shopping center.</TE>
<TE>   "Our first priority is missions," said Kim, a former businessman
who entered the ministry relatively late in life. To reach out, he
wants to open up the place to non-Koreans in the community for
sports, recreation, music and theater events.</TE>
<TE>   "I want our church to be the place where people come, not only to
worship and pray, but to eat, play and relax," he said as he showed
off the park-like site, complete with a trickling stream shaded by
decades-old oaks. "Wouldn't this spot make a wonderful place for
family picnics?"</TE>
<TE>   The two-story main sanctuary is designed like a concert hall, with
a stage that can accommodate hundreds of performers. Classrooms,
indoor basketball and volleyball courts and a fellowship hall capable
of seating 800 people are planned for the adjoining multipurpose
facility.</TE>
<TE>   Kim, whose father and older brother are also Presbyterian
ministers, became a pastor after he got a second lease on life.</TE>
<TE>   In 1973, two years after he arrived in the United States,
tuberculosis put him in a hospital for three months. While there, Kim
said he told God, "Lord, if you will give me my health, I will be
your servant for the rest of my life."</TE>
<TE>   God answered his prayer, he said. "I have not been sick once since
then," Kim said.</TE>
<TE>   After a successful stint in the travel and insurance businesses,
he completed studies at two seminaries -- one Korean and one American
-- and was ordained in 1985. He started his church in 1987 in his Van
Nuys home with 25 people.</TE>
<TE>   Today the congregation has 1,200 registered members, with about
700, including children, attending Sunday services. In addition to
presiding over the congregation and the building project, he is
working on a doctorate at Fuller Theological Seminary, where his son
is a seminarian.</TE>
<TE>   Christians make up fewer than a quarter of South Korea's
population, but in the United States, about 70% of Korean immigrants
say they attend Christian churches, according to research by
demographer Eui-Young Yu, a sociology professor at Cal State Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The churches are among the most important institutions for Korean
immigrants in the United States, offering not only spiritual support,
but also a vital social network.</TE>
<TE>   In the Los Angeles area, Korean churches range in size from the
8,000-member Young Nak Presbyterian Church of Los Angeles, which
occupies nearly 10 acres between Chinatown and Lincoln Heights, down
to house churches that sometimes seem to crop up out of nowhere and
just as quickly close their doors.</TE>
<TE>   At any given time there are more than 800 Korean churches in the
region, according to those who study them.</TE>
<TE>   "Koreans are a very religious and passionate people," said Lee,
the past president of the council of Korean churches. "They give a
lot of money to their churches."</TE>
<TE>   Edward T. Chang, professor of ethnic studies at UC Riverside, said
he believes that there are too many Korean American churches and that
they drain resources from the community.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem with Korean American churches is that they act as if
they are not part of the community," he said. "They maintain a strict
distinction between what's sacred and what's secular."</TE>
<TE>   Chang also said that an overwhelming majority of Korean churches
are fundamentalist and are too preoccupied with the hereafter and not
enough with the here and now.</TE>
<TE>   "The Korean American church could play a very important role, but
so far they haven't," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The role of the churches since the earliest days of Korean
immigration has been as a home away from home and a source of solace
to their members, and that legacy needs to be passed on, said Valley
Christian Presbyterian's Pastor Kim.</TE>
<TE>   "Some may criticize me for trying to build a big church, but we
need to leave something for our third and fourth generations," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   As time goes on, he said, his church's English-language ministry
will become an important tool in reaching out to American-born
Koreans and non-Koreans. Korean American pastors are concerned that
many young Koreans may be lost to the community after they leave home
for college.</TE>
<TE>   Hae K. Jung, an elder at Valley Christian Presbyterian, hopes
churches like his can stem that trend and, in the process, evangelize
non-Koreans.</TE>
<TE>   "More than 100 years ago, American missionaries came to Korea to
spread the gospel," he said. "Now Koreans are spreading the gospel in
America."</TE>

<HD>Massive School Building Plan Overhauled</HD>
<DH>Conflict between Santa Ana Unified staff and a management
consultant prompted revamp. The pace of construction has become
political fodder.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Yi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A massive construction plan to ease overcrowding in Santa Ana schools
is being overhauled because of differences between the school
district's staff and a consultant hired to manage the
multimillion-dollar program.</LD>
<LD>   Bill Sharp, chief facilities officer for the Santa Ana Unified
School District, said Friday that his team and consultant Del Terra
Construction Group are working to develop firmer budget projections
and planning drafts, and improve communication.</LD>
<LD>   "There are always problems with a program of this magnitude,"
Sharp said. "But are we doing something to change that? Yes, we are.
Are we restructuring the entire program? Yes, we are."</LD>
<TE>   The pace of construction for a $145-million school bond measure
has become political fodder in a campaign to unseat school board
members John Palacio and Nadia Maria Davis on Nov. 5, and a February
election to recall a third, Nativo Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   The 62,000-student district is one of the most overcrowded in the
state. About 80% of the schools house more students than they were
designed for.</TE>
<TE>   Problems in the relationship between Del Terra and district staff
were detailed in an Aug. 8 internal district memo that criticized the
company for failing to provide sufficient information on construction
plans and for the high turnover of people working on the project.</TE>
<TE>   In the memo, obtained by The Times, the district's former director
of facilities planning, Gordon Itow, recommended firing the
consultant.</TE>
<TE>   "In my opinion, the deficiencies of Del Terra's performance [are]
clear and the district should consider severing all contracts with
them," Itow wrote in the memo to supervisors. Itow left the district
later that month to oversee construction at Anaheim City School
District.</TE>
<TE>   Del Terra president Luis Rojas defended his firm.</TE>
<TE>   "We were never notified [by the district] of any performance
issues at all," he said. "I stand behind my company. I stand behind
my staff and its credibility and its performance."</TE>
<TE>   Board president Palacio defended Del Terra and dismissed internal
criticisms as sour grapes by staffers who resented outsiders taking
control of the management of construction projects.</TE>
<TE>   "The staff believes that it can do a better job than the
professionals," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Asst. Supt. Donald Stabler, Itow's former boss, said he asked Itow
to summarize the district's dealings with Del Terra before departing
so that he and others could refer to it for background.</TE>
<TE>   Itow said in an interview that he left the Santa Ana district in
part because of his frustrations with Del Terra.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Measure C passed in 1999, Del Terra was hired to
help plan and implement bond-related construction and other projects
now estimated to total almost $660 million. Del Terra could receive
several million dollars in compensation.</TE>
<TE>   Sharp and other district officials said they are confident Measure
C soon will begin to yield new classrooms. The first of the projects,
expansions of four elementary schools, is scheduled to begin within a
month.</TE>
<TE>   District officials have blamed the slow pace of construction on
the lack of undeveloped land in the city for new schools.</TE>
<TE>   But in his memo, Itow also raised concerns about Del Terra's
performance, including a high rate of turnover. Three Del Terra
managers working with Santa Ana Unified resigned last year. Itow also
said the company couldn't explain a difference of more than $100
million in budget forecasts for the construction.</TE>
<TE>   Rojas said staff turnover is common in the competitive
construction industry, and that district staff officials were well
aware of the budget figures.</TE>
<TE>   Sharp said it is not uncommon for budget forecasts to vary widely
as projects progress because more information is gathered and
economic conditions change. He noted that the four expansion projects
slated to begin soon were budgeted at $32 million, but will cost
about $24 million.</TE>
<TE>   This year the district paid only $2 million of a disputed $5
million billed by Del Terra, Stabler said, because "we didn't feel
the scope of the work was completed to the extent they said they
had."</TE>
<TE>   Rojas said differences between consultants and their clients about
the amount of work completed are common, and said he is confident the
matter would be resolved.</TE>

<LD>On a remote foothill site, Gov. Gray Davis inaugurated a 10th
University of California campus Friday. The UC Merced campus is the
state's first since UC Santa Cruz opened in 1967, and will serve the
San Joaquin Valley.</LD>
<LD>   "You had a dream ... You were not going to take no for an answer,"
said Davis, who committed more than $230 million in state funds to
the UC Merced campus over three years, despite its potential threats
to endangered species and doubts inside the UC system about funding a
new campus.</LD>
<LD>   The campus is expected to open in 2004.</LD>

<HD>Capps Is in Tight Money Race</HD>
<DH>The congresswoman's opponent in the 23rd District, Beth
Rogers, leads in fund-raising.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Catherine Saillant</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Campaign finance reports show Rep. Lois Capps (D-Santa Barbara) is
facing an aggressive and well-funded challenger in the race for the
23rd Congressional District seat.</LD>
<LD>   Republican businesswoman Beth Rogers, 57, had raised $1.44 million
as of Oct. 16, reports filed this week show.</LD>
<LD>   That more than matches the $1.34 million raised by Capps, 64, a
two-term congresswoman hoping to win in a newly drawn coastal
district that stretches from San Luis Obispo to Port Hueneme.</LD>
<TE>   Rogers' campaign manager, Bob Tapella, said the candidate knew she
would have to raise big dollars to get her name and platform known in
a district that takes in three counties and 27 cities.</TE>
<TE>   About half of the money in Rogers' treasury comes from her own
bank account, the spending reports show. Capps has been in office for
more than five years and voters already know her name and record,
Tapella said.</TE>
<TE>   "In any campaign, you have to raise your name ID and that takes
money," Tapella said. "Beth and [husband] Richard made a pledge that
they would take enough money out of their retirement and savings to
keep up with Lois."</TE>
<TE>   The multimillion dollar campaign is attracting the interest of
strategists, who had all but written off Rogers' chance of victory
because Democrats hold a 12-point advantage in registration in the
district.</TE>
<TE>   Voting patterns show the seat is not totally safe for a Democrat,
said Allan Hoffenblum, a GOP strategist and publisher of the
California Target Book, which tracks state and federal races. But it
is much stronger than the district Capps successfully defended in the
last two elections, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In those races, Capps far outspent her Republican opponents. In
1998, when she won a special election to replace her late husband in
the seat, she raised $2.7 million compared with $1.2 million raised
by Republican Tom Bordonaro.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Capps raised $1.6 million, double the amount of
Republican Michael Stoker, federal campaign records show.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers had spent nearly all of the money flowing to her treasury,
but Capps had $636,000 as of Oct. 16, with three weeks left in the
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Capps' campaign manager, Chris Henson, said no more fund-raisers
are planned. He said the congresswoman is neither surprised nor
alarmed by Rogers' campaign treasury.</TE>
<TE>   "We've known that she is an independently wealthy woman and we've
addressed that in our campaign plan," Henson said. "Our plan is to
run the same strong grass-roots campaign that we have always run and
to focus on the issues."</TE>
<TE>   Both women have been spending heavily on local television and
radio ads. Rogers has been criticizing Capps over her vote to oppose
Congress' resolution giving President Bush authority to attack Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Capps' spots have focused on her efforts to pass a Democrat-backed
Medicare prescription plan for seniors, address nursing shortages and
safeguard Social Security.</TE>
<TE>   A third candidate, Libertarian James Hill, is not required to file
spending reports because he intends to raise less than $5,000.</TE>

<HD>Final-Hour Ad Blitz Planned for Hospital Tax</HD>
<DH>Backers of the proposal to fund county trauma centers hope
the campaign gets Measure B the two-thirds vote it needs to pass.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daren Briscoe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A sweating paramedic makes an urgent radio call about the injured
child he's treating -- only to be told that the nearest hospital is
closed to trauma patients. A dispatcher directs him to another
hospital.</LD>
<LD>   "It's too far!" the paramedic says, as the boy's distraught mother
looks on.</LD>
<LD>   The emotional scene isn't a trailer for the next prime-time
medical drama, but rather a television commercial supporting a new
tax to help fund the county's cash-starved network of trauma centers
and emergency rooms.</LD>
<TE>   The 30-second spot, paid for by the union representing county
health-care workers, is the dramatic centerpiece of a last-minute,
million-dollar ad campaign on behalf of a proposed new parcel tax for
Los Angeles County residents. If approved, the tax would cost the
owner of an average-sized property -- about 1,400 square feet --
$42.66 a year.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal will appear on the Nov. 5 ballot as Measure B, and,
if passed, would raise $168 million for the emergency and trauma-care
system through a tax on developed property in the county.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters say the tax is needed to save a trauma care system that
has been steadily failing in recent years. Opponents counter that,
while health services do need attention, a new property tax is the
wrong way to pay that bill.</TE>
<TE>   The county's network of trauma hospitals, which numbered 22 in
1985, has since been pared to 13. With the county facing a
health-care budget deficit of $500 million to $750 million within
three years, county supervisors say further cuts will be hard to
avoid.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the most compelling issue on the ballot," said Los Angeles
County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who wrote the measure. "It's about
every man, woman and child in the county -- just a traffic accident,
gunshot or heart attack away from needing an emergency room."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the measure have no plans for an advertising
campaign. Instead, they're counting on a requirement that the new tax
be approved by two-thirds of voters across the county to help defeat
the measure. That requirement, imposed in 1978 by Proposition 13,
historically has made it difficult to win voters' approval for tax
hikes.</TE>
<TE>   "Two-thirds measures are always tough," said Bob Stern, an expert
on money and politics in California who is not involved with Measure
B. "Voters are fairly conservative."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Stern added: "Voters feel ... strongly about
safety and health."</TE>
<TE>   With Measure B, voters will be forced to choose between their
aversion to taxes and their support for improved health care.</TE>
<TE>   "It needs a two-thirds vote, and therein lies a significant
protection," said Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis
Taxpayer's Assn. Coupal said the county should "reprioritize"
existing spending rather than levy a new tax at a time "when
taxpayers are really stretched to the limit."</TE>
<TE>   There are other hurdles facing the measure. It appears on a
November ballot crowded with other attention-grabbing issues,
including a host of statewide political campaigns; Valley and
Hollywood secession; Measure K, a $3.3-billion bond for school
construction in the Los Angeles Unified School District; and Measure
A, a $250-million bond that would pay for earthquake and fire safety
improvements at county-owned science and cultural institutions.</TE>
<TE>   Measure B also got a late start. A divided county board of
supervisors approved it for the ballot in late July, and many voters
are still only dimly aware of the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't like we had a lot of lead time to put together a
coalition," said Rick Taylor, campaign consultant for the Measure B
Saves Lives Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The committee's roster includes Mayor James K. Hahn; Thomas M.
Priselac, president of Cedars Sinai Medical Center; the Los Angeles
Area Chamber of Commerce; the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor;
and former Mayor Richard Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the abbreviated campaign, Taylor said, "has made it tougher
to raise money." Of the approximately $1.5 million or so the campaign
said it has raised so far, $900,000 has come from the Service
Employees International Union.</TE>
<TE>   About 20,000 members of Local 660 chapter work in the county
health-care system, according to the union.</TE>
<TE>   Private hospital groups have also contributed, concerned that
further cuts in the county's trauma and emergency room network could
inundate their emergency rooms with patients.</TE>
<TE>   The difficulty, supporters of the measure say, is getting average
people to appreciate the scope and seriousness of the problem. To
counter that, supporters of the measure are sending approximately 4
million pieces of direct mail to Los Angeles County residents.</TE>
<TE>   "The target audience is middle-class Angelenos who are under the
misconception that this is not for them," Yaroslavsky said. "This is
for them, make no mistake about it."</TE>
<TE>   To make that point, Yaroslavsky notes that if Microsoft founder
Bill Gates were seriously injured in an auto accident on the 110
freeway near downtown, even Gates, a multibillionaire, would be taken
to County-USC Medical Center for trauma care.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich agreed that the
trauma care system is important, but voted with Supervisor Don Knabe
against placing the measure on the ballot. Antonovich called Measure
B "an assault" on homeowners, people on fixed incomes and property
owners.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a new property tax for non-property tax-related services,"
said Antonovich. He added that the state, not the county, should
rescue struggling local trauma centers.</TE>

<HD>Traffic Fuels Debate Over Measure A</HD>
<DH>Two studies offer contradictory findings over whether
hillside development in Ventura would worsen crowding on the city's
roads.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jenifer Ragland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Traffic has emerged as the hot-button issue in the Measure A campaign
over future growth on Ventura's hillsides, prompting the release of
dueling reports this week.</LD>
<LD>   But the contradictory findings of the studies -- released less
than two weeks before the Nov. 5 election -- may end up causing more
confusion for Ventura voters, who must decide how their city will
grow over the next 20 years.</LD>
<LD>   Sponsored by landowners in the sprawling development area, Measure
A seeks voter approval for a plan that would add 1,390 homes in six
neighborhoods to the hills and canyons north of town.</LD>
<TE>   According to the landowners' study, the project would add no more
than 3,000 car trips on Foothill Road each day when completed in
2020. By contrast, a report by opponents of the housing plan predicts
that as many as 8,760 trips would be added to the road.</TE>
<TE>   Projections of total daily trips on all roads leading to and from
the project also vary: Proponents say it would be 9,900, while
opponents counter with a figure of 14,600.</TE>
<TE>   Initiative foes calculated the higher numbers using data from the
city, an engineering book and the Measure A plan, said Brooke
Ashworth, a planner and member of Citizens for Hillside Preservation.</TE>
<TE>   According to the opponents' report, Measure A would cause traffic
on twisting Foothill Road to become severely congested. The only way
to solve that problem would be to widen the street, the report says,
which is not part of the project.</TE>
<TE>   Though Ashworth is not a traffic engineer, she said a "qualified
professional" helped her group come up with the numbers.</TE>
<TE>   She would not reveal the name of the traffic engineer, saying the
person fears retaliation from the city for speaking out against the
project.</TE>
<TE>   But Measure A proponents, including a team of lawyers and
consultants hired by the family that has owned the hillside land for
generations, said the opponents' report is flawed.</TE>
<TE>   Camarillo consultant Jeff Palmer said his firm was hired by Lloyd
Properties to conduct the kind of traffic study that a formal
environmental report will require if the project is approved by
voters.</TE>
<TE>   On Foothill Road, traffic would increase by about 160 trips during
morning rush hour, and by about 209 trips during peak times in the
evening, according to traffic engineer Bob Matson in a summary of his
findings released Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   No portion of Foothill would have to be widened, Palmer said, and
traffic flow would not change significantly.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the reason there would be so few new trips from nearly
1,400 new houses is because much of the traffic would be routed onto
other main arteries running directly to freeways, Palmer said.</TE>
<TE>   On those streets, such as Victoria Avenue, Palmer said the report
shows traffic flow would not reach road capacity or exceed
recommended use levels in city plans.</TE>
<TE>   In response, opponents object to assumptions in the landowners'
study, particularly the finding that only 30% of peak-hour traffic
from the development would use Foothill.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer said such assumptions are the norm in traffic studies.</TE>
<TE>   "There are various reasons why these studies are done by a
registered engineer and not just by calculations," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Measure A backers did the traffic study months ago, they
said they were reluctant to release it without prior city review.</TE>
<TE>   At the urging of Measure A opponents, the Ventura City Council in
May decided not to review several studies the landowner offered,
including traffic, fiscal and environmental analyses.</TE>
<TE>   "In that kind of environment, why would we release [the traffic
study], just so it could be picked apart with rumor and innuendo?"
said Amy Forbes, the landowners' attorney.</TE>

<HD>Once-Conjoined Twins May Leave L.A. Tuesday</HD>
<DH>The girls are recovering and will get further care in their
native Guatemala.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Cara Mia DiMassa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The conjoined twins who were separated in a 22-hour operation at UCLA
Medical Center in early August could return home to Guatemala as
early as Tuesday, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Maria de Jesus and Maria Teresa Quiej Alvarez, who have been
undergoing physical therapy to learn how to crawl, eat and use their
heads independently, are expected to be well enough next week to
travel and return to a hospital in Guatemala, where they will
continue their recovery.</LD>
<LD>   The girls, who shared a skull and some important blood vessels,
were separated by a team of surgeons who cut through the babies'
skull, redirected some veins and covered the exposed brains with skin
grafts.</LD>
<TE>   Dr. Henry Kawamoto Jr., the lead plastic surgeon for the girls'
medical team, said that one of the skin grafts on Maria de Jesus'
head, the size of a nickel, had not properly healed.</TE>
<TE>   How that wound heals will determine whether the 1-year-old girls
are released from the Westwood hospital next week.</TE>
<TE>   "We will know by Sunday," said Kawamoto. "The main thing is,
neither is in danger."</TE>
<TE>   Since the initial surgery, Maria Teresa has undergone three
surgical procedures to remove blood from her brain.</TE>
<TE>   But surgeons are optimistic about the girls' recovery.</TE>
<TE>   If Maria de Jesus is well enough to travel, the girls will leave
UCLA Tuesday morning with their parents, Alba Leticia Alvarez and
Wenceslao Quiej-Lopez, and board a plane for Guatemala that day at
Burbank Airport. FedEx will provide a corporate jet for their ride
home.</TE>
<TE>   Cris Embleton, founder of Healing the Children, the nonprofit
group that sponsored the twins' trip to the United States, said that
because of the neural surgery, "we didn't want a bumpy ride."</TE>
<TE>   The corporate jet, she said, will be able to fly at higher
altitudes, with less turbulence than a passenger jet.</TE>
<TE>   A UCLA medical team, including a neurologist, a pediatric
intensive care doctor, a physical therapist, an occupational
therapist and two nurses, will travel on the plane as well and will
oversee the girls' transfer to physicians at a state hospital in
Guatemala City.</TE>
<TE>   The Guatemalan Pediatric Foundation, which worked with Healing the
Children to bring the girls to the United States, will oversee their
care there.</TE>
<TE>   The girls still face months of physical therapy and eventually
more surgeries to stretch their scalps, eliminate the skin grafts and
allow for full heads of hair.</TE>
<TE>   Kawamoto said he expects that surgeons in Guatemala City will
perform those operations.</TE>
<TE>   Kawamoto and the rest of the UCLA medical team that operated on
the twins donated their services. UCLA is absorbing the cost of the
twins' medical care, estimated at $1.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Embleton, who will accompany the girls back to Guatemala, said she
is grateful for the many people who have helped the girls reach this
point.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to just stand back in awe that so many people said, 'I'll
do it,' and made this happen."</TE>

<HD>Council Hopefuls Aim to Beautify 7th District</HD>
<DH>Valley city candidates want North Hollywood, Sun Valley
area to look more like Brentwood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTINA SAUERWEIN</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In sagging sections of Sun Valley and North Hollywood, residents want
streets with sidewalks and trees as abundant as those in Brentwood.
And if the Westside brims with Starbucks coffeehouses, they ask, why
can't the northeast San Fernando Valley?</LD>
<LD>   In the Nov. 5 secession election, the five candidates for the 7th
District seat on the proposed Valley city council have vowed to bring
the area everything from paved walkways to jacaranda trees to a
jazz-playing java joint. The 14-member council will take office only
if secession wins.</LD>
<LD>   "We'd love a Starbucks," said candidate Gina G. Goldman-Ruiz, a
Sun Valley resident. "I want to make this place more like Brentwood.
It's an eyesore."</LD>
<TE>   Of course, it's not just about a Starbucks, said Goldman-Ruiz, a
33-year-old business owner who has lived in the Valley most of her
life. She said the district needs many more restaurants and shops.</TE>
<TE>   The working-class neighborhoods of the 7th District are crowded
with auto-repair shops, gravel pits and wrecking yards. Many of its
apartment buildings are run-down.</TE>
<TE>   The neighborhoods, both tidy and unkempt, also lack street lights
and parks. In addition, residents have complained to the city about
inadequate sewers.</TE>
<TE>   "The area looks like Tijuana," said Goldman-Ruiz, the niece of the
late Mexican movie star Maria Felix and a longtime civic volunteer in
the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   As a councilwoman, Goldman-Ruiz said, she would tackle the
district's problems while being fiscally responsible. She said she
would listen to constituents and attract more businesses by cleaning
up the neighborhoods and reducing bureaucratic hurdles.</TE>
<TE>   Candidate Jose Roy Garcia also sees neglect in the district. He
said the city needs to do more to rid the area of litter. A few weeks
ago, Garcia said, he got so sick of the garbage and the city's
indifference to it that he rented a truck, filled it with litter
himself and unloaded it into a dumpster.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to wait for the city," said Garcia, 47, a flooring
contractor. The longtime Valley resident also founded a soccer league
for underprivileged children.</TE>
<TE>   In a Valley city, Garcia said, he would make sure potholes in his
district were plugged immediately. He scoffed at L.A.'s recent
commitment to fill potholes within 24 hours of a complaint.</TE>
<TE>   "I've called for two weeks to complain about a pothole, and it's
still not fixed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia said he also wants to rid the area of gangs and graffiti
through such measures as programs aimed at deterring crime and city
cleanup crews that respond quickly. "No matter what, I will stand up
and yell for the community," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Candidate Carol Silver, who owns a printing business, said she
often calls City Hall on behalf of customers struggling with L.A.'s
bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too big the way it is now," said Silver, 51, a civic
activist who formerly worked in public relations and journalism. "I
intend to treat all [constituents] like I do my customers. If they
show respect and honor by voting for you, they deserve to deal with
someone pleasant."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles City Council members who have represented the
northeast Valley, Silver said, "go downtown or to Sacramento and they
just change. There will be no more sweetheart deals."</TE>
<TE>   If elected, Silver said, one of her first priorities will be to
add street lights to the area. Crime flourishes in darkness, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Sparse lighting and the lack of public transit are particularly
hard on older people, Silver said. "At night, they become prisoners
of their homes," she said. "They're taxpayers and homeowners, but
still prisoners."</TE>
<TE>   If secession passes, candidate James H. Eric Freedner said he
expects legal trouble between the Valley city and Los Angeles. He
said his work as a Beverly Hills paralegal has prepared him to look
out for a new city's interests in any battles over service contracts
with Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's historic, and I think it could get messy," said Freedner,
52, who rides a motorcycle to save gas.</TE>
<TE>   Freedner said he wants a new city to have a controlling stake in
Burbank Airport, which is near the district. Noise and traffic
generated by the airport harm the area's quality of life, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Like other District 7 candidates, Freedner wants more sidewalks,
street lights and trees, and a quick response for pothole repair.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't the fanciest part of the Valley," Freedner said.</TE>
<TE>   Candidate Sergio F. Barreno said he, too, would like to spruce up
the area.</TE>
<TE>   "We need better neighborhoods," said the 62-year-old health-care
worker. "We have no sidewalks. No drainage. The city does not provide
a good cleaning service."</TE>
<TE>   And City Hall workers don't display good manners when speaking
with the public, Barreno said. "They need to show some kind of
friendliness toward people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Barreno said he often works on home remodeling projects and is
appalled at the "rude" inspectors "who come in like they own the
place and don't respond when I say 'Hello.' "</TE>
<TE>   That would never happen, Barreno said, if he were a councilman in
a new city. Barreno said he also wants to make the northeast Valley
friendlier to businesses by making it easier to obtain licenses and
permits.</TE>
<TE>   "I want any kind of business that is willing to relocate here,"
Barreno said.</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eight years after she was first convicted of animal cruelty for
keeping severely malnourished horses, an Oak View woman has been
ordered to spend a year in Ventura County Jail for violating her
probation, authorities said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   After her 1994 conviction, Renae Lynn Ferguson was placed on five
years of probation and ordered not to own horses. In 1999, she was
again convicted of animal cruelty and operating a horse market
without a license in Los Angeles County, and sentenced to six months
in jail.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County authorities issued a warrant for her arrest in 2000
because the 1999 conviction was a violation of her 1994 probation.
She finally appeared in court on the case Thursday. Two years of
delays occurred because Ferguson, 32, failed to appear in court
several times and also was struck by a car and seriously injured
earlier this year.</LD>

<HD>Water Panel Holds Key to Transfer Pact</HD>
<DH>A deal to shift rural supplies to cities hinges on approval
by a divided Imperial Valley board.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Vogel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A plan to shift water from farms to cities and spare California a
drastic cutback of its Colorado River supply got approval this week
from three of the four agencies that must sign off on the deal and
now rests in the hands of a conflicted Imperial Irrigation District
board.</LD>
<LD>   The board's concurrence is by no means assured, said Stella
Mendoza, one of the district's five panel members. She said she will
vote against the water transfer because of its potential harm to jobs
and businesses in the Imperial Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Under the agreement, hammered out in marathon negotiations last
week, farmers would plant fewer crops and sell irrigation water to
San Diego. The transfer could satisfy up to one-third of San Diego's
annual water needs. Over the 75-year life of the agreement, San Diego
expects to pay $2 billion for the water and to offset the economic
harm of idling farmland in Imperial Valley.</LD>
<TE>   The importance of the pact extends to all of Southern California.
The federal government considers the water transfer key to averting a
sudden disruption of Colorado River supplies. For decades California
has used more than its legal share of the river, to the growing ire
of the six other states along the Colorado River. California has
promised to reduce its take over the next 15 years. Part of that
commitment involves meeting a Jan. 1 deadline to redistribute
Colorado River water among in-state users through such means as the
water transfer.</TE>
<TE>   The broad elements of the transfer won approval this week of the
boards of the San Diego County Water Authority, the Metropolitan
Water District of Southern California and the Coachella Valley Water
District.</TE>
<TE>   A hundred miles east of San Diego, where Imperial Valley residents
must live with the consequences of less water, the Imperial
Irrigation District board has decided to take no action on the plan
until public workshops are held and lawyers have translated the deal
into legally binding language.</TE>
<TE>   "I think after I read all the paper they're going to draw up in
the next month or so, if it's to my satisfaction then I can support
the transfer," said Imperial Irrigation District board member and
farmer Lloyd Allen. "We down here don't want to be anybody who stops
the transfer."</TE>
<TE>   Allen said he is convinced that the district will face a legal
attack on its water rights if it does not agree to another water
transfer.</TE>
<TE>   A third board member, Andy Horne, said he is reserving judgment
until he is sure that the transfer does not violate federal
guidelines governing the district's use of the water it gets from the
Colorado River. "I can understand why the other water agencies would
move so quickly to approve it because they are the ones getting the
water. We are the ones giving it up."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly a century ago, the Imperial Irrigation District locked up
rights to roughly one-fifth of the Colorado River's flow. Cities on
the coast have lately viewed its alfalfa fields and unlined ditches
as a water source. In the mid-1980s, after being accused of wasteful
irrigation practices, the district agreed to transfer to the MWD
enough water each year to supply half a million people.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposed agreement, the Imperial Irrigation District
farmers would idle as many as 30,000 acres of 450,000 cultivated
acres over 15 years. After that, water sold to San Diego would come
from conservation measures.</TE>
<TE>   For years Imperial Valley farmers resisted the notion of fallowing
land, fearing harm to shopkeepers, tractor dealers, crop dusters and
others who earn a living from agriculture. But environmentalists
succeeded in making the Salton Sea a major issue in a water transfer.
The giant lake is sustained by runoff from Imperial Valley farm
fields. Fallowing frees up more water than conservation, allowing
some water to continue flowing to the Salton Sea.</TE>
<TE>   A possible fallowing pact with the Imperial Irrigation District
comes on the heels of a historic agreement between the MWD and
eastern Riverside County farmers in the Palo Verde Irrigation
District.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the MWD board voted to finalize an arrangement whereby
the MWD will pay farmers not to grow crops on 7% to 29% of their land
in any year and then transfer the water no longer needed for crops to
the MWD for distribution among the 17 million people it serves.
Farmers will receive a onetime payment of $3,170 and an annual
payment of $550 for each acre they enroll.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the water produced by Palo Verde farmers will be
transferred to San Diego , a customer of the MWD, under the agreement
reached last week.</TE>

<HD>Best of Kevin</HD>
<DH>Rotation has been hit hard, but with Appier starting in a
must-win situation, Angels desperately need ...</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The afternoon was dark and drizzly at Edison Field on Friday, the
kind of gray day appropriate as the backdrop to an Alfred Hitchcock
film. Cue the ominous music. Creep to the edge of your seat.
Something bad might happen sometime soon.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels must win at Anaheim today, in Game 6 of the World
Series, or the San Francisco Giants will be champions. If the Angels
win today, they must also win Sunday, in what would be a
winner-take-all finale, and then they will be champions.</LD>
<LD>   This thriller is not so much about whodunit than about
who-can-do-it. The Angels can generate enough offense to win these
two games, but how do they propose getting the necessary 54 outs from
a tattered and battered pitching staff?</LD>
<TE>   Kevin Appier starts today. He started Game 2 and got six outs.
Ramon Ortiz, bothered by tendinitis in his right wrist, could make
his first major league relief appearance today. Rookie John Lackey,
who got 15 outs as the Game 4 starter, could start on three days'
rest Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Closer Troy Percival, who has not gotten more than four outs in
any game this season, could be asked to get six today or Sunday, or
both. Ace Jarrod Washburn, who got 12 outs as the Game 5 starter,
could pitch in relief Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Angel Manager Mike Scioscia even broached the idea of using
reliever Scott Schoeneweis as Sunday's starter. Schoeneweis has not
gotten more than six outs in a game since his removal from the
starting rotation in June.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm confident," Scioscia said Friday. "They're going to have to
get 54 outs too -- well, 27 at a time, hoping they lose. But it works
both ways. They're going to have to shut us down. They're going to
have every bit the challenge we're going to have."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, a shutout for either side is about as likely as a rainout.
The Angels are batting .328 in the World Series, the Giants .308. The
Giants have hit 25 postseason home runs, the Angels 22, the two
highest totals in major league history.</TE>
<TE>   And Russ Ortiz, who starts today for San Francisco, gave up nine
hits -- and got only five outs -- when he started Game 2 against
Appier.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not down three games. We're not down two. We're only down
one," Angel hitting coach Mickey Hatcher said. "To say there's a lot
of momentum there, there isn't. If we can tie it up, it's going to
Game 7 on our home court....</TE>
<TE>   "We've got the fans. We've got the monkey. We've got the sausage
bangers. We've got it all going for us."</TE>
<TE>   With all due respect, the Angels do not have outstanding starting
pitching going for them right now, or even adequate starting
pitching. In 14 postseason games, the Angel starter has finished the
sixth inning three times.</TE>
<TE>   "They haven't pitched deep enough into a game," Scioscia said. "If
they don't do that, your bullpen is taxed a little more. Things can
get thin."</TE>
<TE>   With Washburn, the Angels are shocked if he does not pitch into
the sixth inning. With Appier, they are surprised and pleased if he
does.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Giants dismissed him after two innings in Game 2,
Appier pitched five, five and 5 1/3 innings in each of his three
previous playoff starts.</TE>
<TE>   "They weren't textbook, but they were good," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels won two of those games and lost the other, 2-1. So, in
a decision resulting from equal parts faith and necessity, Appier
starts today.</TE>
<TE>   If he can pitch five innings, the Angels would be happy to take
their chances splitting the final four between Francisco Rodriguez
and Percival. But the Angels will not hesitate to yank him and
replace him with Ortiz, or with Schoeneweis.</TE>
<TE>   Schoeneweis, considered the Angels' antidote to Barry Bonds as
their lone left-handed reliever, has not been used in that role since
Game 1. With the Angels increasingly content to walk Bonds, they need
not save Schoeneweis for a late-inning duel with the San Francisco
slugger.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia floated the idea of starting Schoeneweis on Sunday, then
downplayed the idea as "unlikely." Unless the Angels need to use
Ortiz and Lackey to win today, which would likely mean an
extra-inning game, Schoeneweis would figure to be used as a reliever
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   So would Washburn, but Scioscia dismissed any thought of Washburn
starting on two days' rest as "a longshot" that could jeopardize his
health and his career.</TE>
<TE>   For the Angels to win these two games, and with them the World
Series championship, they might use relievers as starters and
starters as relievers, in permutations so numerous the mind recoils.
Good thing, then, that Scioscia gave his players Friday off and told
them to flip their brain switches off.</TE>
<TE>   "You could see a little bit of drainage there," Hatcher said.
"Just being able to stay home and turn their cellular phones off and
watch 'Gilligan's Island' -- getting away will be a good relief for
these guys."</TE>
<TE>   In the first five innings today, for the Angels, no relief would
be better than good relief.</TE>

<TE>   Update--The Angels are 3-1 in the four playoff games started by
Appier. He lost, 2-1, and received no decision in games the Angels
won, 8-6, 13-5 and 11-10. In that last game, Game 2 of the World
Series, Appier gave up three home runs -- to Reggie Sanders, David
Bell and Jeff Kent -- within a span of seven batters. Ortiz started
that game for the Giants, giving up nine hits in 1 2/3 innings. The
first four batters each hit safely and scored, with Tim Salmon
hitting a home run in the second inning. Ortiz did not make it
through the fifth inning of his previous start, in the National
League championship series.</TE>

<HD>Recess Is Over, Children</HD>
<DH>Baker is told by official to keep a much closer eye on his
batboy son</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Darren Baker, the cute and cuddly 3-year-old son of San Francisco
Giant Manager Dusty Baker who was nearly trampled near home plate in
the seventh inning of Game 5 Thursday night in Pacific Bell Park,
will be back in the Giants' dugout as a batboy for Game 6 tonight in
Edison Field, but with a short leash.</LD>
<LD>   Baker's mother scolded Dusty after the game, and Baker's wife
urged Dusty to keep Darren in the dugout, but the admonishment with
the highest impact came in a telephone call to Baker on Friday from
Sandy Alderson, Major League Baseball's executive vice president of
operations.</LD>
<LD>   "He's going to be allowed to be a batboy this weekend," said
Baker, whose team is 8-0 with Darren as batboy and doesn't want to
mess with baseball superstition. "But I have to monitor him a little
closer."</LD>
<TE>   According to Alderson, baseball has no uniform rules prohibiting
kids of any age from serving as batboys -- each team sets its own
policy. The Angels, for instance, do not employ any batboys who are
under 18.</TE>
<TE>   The Giant dugout, on the other hand, has resembled a day-care
center at times.</TE>
<TE>   The young sons of Barry Bonds (Nikolai), Jeff Kent (Hunter), J.T.
Snow (Shane), Shawon Dunston (Shawon Jr.) and Baker have served as
batboys in recent months, and it's common for three or four of them
to be in the Giant dugout during playoff games.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't intend to prohibit it," Alderson said. "But, on the
other hand, I'm sure even Dusty would agree great care is appropriate
for someone of [Darren's] age under those circumstances. I'm sure
that care will exist and had been arranged, and [Thursday] night was
a one-time occurrence."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, if it happens again ...</TE>
<TE>   "They'll probably address it sometime at the winter meetings,"
Baker said. "There will probably be some pros and cons and some rules
and regulations.... I'm just hoping that they don't come up with some
Darren Baker rule that prohibits kids from being in the dugout, from
being able to do these things."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels were concerned enough about the potential safety and
liability issues surrounding a serious accident involving the young
batboys that they placed a call to Alderson on Friday afternoon. But
they intend to leave the issue in baseball's hands.</TE>
<TE>   "It's cute, and I'm sure it's a thrill for the kids," said Kevin
Uhlich, the Angels' senior vice president of baseball operations.
"But that could have been a dangerous situation."</TE>
<TE>   Baker said neither he nor the parents of the other Giant batboys
have ever signed a waiver releasing the Giants, another team or Major
League Baseball of liability in case of a catastrophic injury
involving a batboy.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody's gonna sue nobody," Baker said. "That's just our
litigious society at work. We don't think that way. We're more
conscious of foul balls going into the dugout and getting them into
safe spots."</TE>
<TE>   Little Darren Baker found himself in a precarious spot Thursday
night. With Snow on second and David Bell on first, Lofton smacked a
triple off the top of the right-center field wall.</TE>
<TE>   As Snow cruised into home, Darren came to the plate to retrieve
Lofton's bat. With Bell barreling toward the plate and Angel catcher
Bengie Molina preparing for a possible play, Snow, as he crossed the
plate, reached back and scooped Darren up by the lapels of his little
Giant jacket and pulled him out of harm's way before carrying him
back to the dugout.</TE>
<TE>   "The Lone Ranger would have been proud of J.T.," Baker said. "It
looked like he scooped him up from his horse."</TE>
<TE>   Baker, however, was not real proud of the parenting skills he
exhibited on the play. He had his eye on Lofton's hit and not on his
son.</TE>
<TE>   "We usually have a lot of guys who are keeping an eye on the
[kids]," Baker said. "[Thursday] night was a strange situation where
[Darren] was having a brief argument with another kid, because he
really likes Kenny Lofton. Certain kids like to pick up a certain
guy's bat, or certain kids like to pick up their father's bat.</TE>
<TE>   "Darren really likes Lofton. Being competitive, he and this kid
were arguing. He figured he was going to get the jump on the kid to
go get the bat. Usually he stands behind me. I tell him to go just
before he goes out. This time, he was going to get a jump on
everybody. We were all watching the ball; we thought it was going to
be a home run.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to happen again. I'm hoping that him and other
kids aren't prohibited from being in the dugout [because of this].</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not proud of it. I don't like seeing my son all over TV in
that light. Some people think it's cute, but I don't. I don't like
watching him in the paper. He told me he's tired of being in the
paper himself."</TE>

<HD>Selig Fines Mets $50,000 Over Howe's Hiring</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wires Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not only did the Mets lose out in their quest for Lou Piniella, now
they're being punished for their handling of Art Howe's hiring.</LD>
<LD>   Commissioner Bud Selig was so infuriated by the circus atmosphere
surrounding the Mets' managerial search during the World Series that
he fined the club $50,000 for defying his edict against interfering
with the Fall Classic.</LD>
<LD>   Selig, according to a baseball official, wanted the Mets to name a
manager before the World Series or hold off until it concluded. Selig
even reminded the parties involved on Tuesday that they were
forbidden to make any major announcements during the Series.</LD>
<TE>   Although neither the Mets nor any other team has officially named
a manager during the Series, Selig believed the process could have
been carried out more quietly, especially the daily tug-of-war
between the Seattle Mariners and Mets. It was unclear Friday if any
other teams besides the Mets were fined.</TE>
<TE>   What also is unclear is just how much influence Howe will have on
the makeup of his coaching staff. Bobby Valentine had only limited
say, and often his coaches seemed like pawns in a grudge match
between Valentine and General Manager Steve Phillips. But some
intriguing names -- such as Don Baylor as Howe's bench coach -- have
surfaced as potential candidates.</TE>
<TE>   One person being considered as a replacement for pitching coach
Charlie Hough is former Met pitching coach Dave Wallace, now a roving
instructor with the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   From Newsday</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was also announced Friday that Howe will manage a team of major
leaguers who will play exhibition games in Japan next month.</TE>
<TE>   Among those on the roster are shortstop David Eckstein and
left-hander Scott Schoeneweis of the Angels and closer Eric Gagne and
catcher Paul Lo Duca of the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco Giant players on the roster are left fielder Barry
Bonds and catcher Benito Santiago.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest draw, however, figures to be Seattle Mariner right
fielder Ichiro Suzuki, Japan's No. 1 sports celebrity who won the
American League MVP and rookie of the year awards in 2001.</TE>

<HD>Evening Attire's Kelly Plays It Close to Vest</HD>
<DH>Trainer says he isn't thinking about the horse-of-the-year
implications in Breeders' Cup Classic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill.</DL>
<LD>Pat Kelly appears to be the exception among trainers who are running
horses in today's eight Breeders' Cup races at Arlington Park.</LD>
<LD>   "Horse of the year is the farthest thing from my mind," Kelly said
at his barn Friday. Those who know Kelly said he wasn't just horsing
around.</LD>
<LD>   Since Kelly won't do any pre-race stumping for his Evening Attire
for horse-of-the-year honors, it was left for trainer Bobby Frankel,
who definitely is thinking about the national title, to quantify the
Classic, which at $4 million is the richest race on the $13-million
Breeders' Cup card.</LD>
<TE>   "If one of four horses wins the Classic, they should win [horse of
the year]," Frankel said. "I'm talking about my horse [Medaglia
d'Oro], War Emblem, Came Home and, to a certain extent, Evening
Attire. But if one of those four doesn't win, then I guess a lot of
things can happen."</TE>
<TE>   An upset in the Classic can conceivably open the door for at least
six other horses: Azeri in the Distaff, Xtra Heat in the Sprint, Beat
Hollow (also trained by Frankel) and Rock Of Gibraltar in the Mile,
and High Chaparral and With Anticipation in the Turf. The group is a
mixture of fillies, sprinters, grass horses and Europeans, categories
that usually don't produce a horse of the year, but in a
hard-to-figure year, one of them might sneak in after the 250 or so
Eclipse Awards voters cast their ballots in December.</TE>
<TE>   Evening Attire is another type that seldom wins the title: A
gelding. Castrated early last year, shortly after he had turned three
years of age, Evening Attire could become the first gelding to be
voted horse of the year since John Henry won for the second time, in
1984.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to win this race," said Kelly, the easy-going
54-year-old son of a Hall of Fame trainer. "All I know is that
Evening Attire is a gelding and a very nice horse, and he seems to be
peaking at the right time for this race."</TE>
<TE>   Evening Attire hadn't won anything higher than a Grade III stake
until he captured the Grade II Saratoga Handicap in August. Then in
September, running in a Grade I for only the second time, he was a 2
3/4-length winner of the Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   Both of those wins came on off tracks, leading handicappers here
to theorize that rain today would play into Kelly's hands. The
forecast is calling for no rain -- and a little sunshine -- for the
first time this week, with temperatures in the low 50s.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's a little water left over on the track, that would be
fine," Kelly said. "But I think this horse is not just a mudder, he's
a nice horse that can handle almost any track. Look at his record --
he's won on both tracks at Aqueduct, at Saratoga and at Belmont. None
of those running surfaces is the same."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly, who dropped out of the University of Miami 32 years ago
while halfway toward an accounting degree, to follow his father,
Tommy Kelly, into the training game, brought Evening Attire here
almost two weeks ago. Most of the Classic trainers waited until this
week to ship their horses into Arlington.</TE>
<TE>   One day this week, Kelly was visited at the barn by Dee Poulos,
the wife of the late Ernie Poulos, who trained Evening Attire's sire,
Black Tie Affair, when he won the Classic at Churchill Downs to nail
down horse of the year in 1991. Cozzene, winner of the 1985 Mile, is
the only Breeders' Cup winner to also sire a winner. Cozzene's son,
Alphabet Soup, won the Classic in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what?" Dee Poulos said to Kelly. "You drew No. 8. That's
the same number Black Tie Affair won from."</TE>
<TE>   Other than both being gray, another bond between Black Tie Affair
and Kelly's horse is that neither was considered a title contender
until late in the year. Starting in June of 1991, Black Tie Affair
won the Stephen Foster Handicap at Churchill Downs and never lost
again. In the Classic, he was 4-1 while beating Festin, Summer
Squall, Unbridled and others. It was Black Tie Affair's sixth
consecutive win and his last race.</TE>
<TE>   Now standing at stud in Japan, Black Tie Affair had a running
style like War Emblem, the front-running Kentucky Derby winner.
Evening Attire has been known to win with early speed, but lately he
has won after sitting just off the pace.</TE>
<TE>   Tommy Kelly bred Evening Attire, mating Black Tie Affair with
Concolour, a filly who ran only four times, won once and earned
$7,200. The elder Kelly, now retired, has often seen Evening Attire
run, but he'll likely watch today's race on TV.</TE>
<TE>   "We got him as far as Kentucky," Pat Kelly said. "But I don't
think he'll make it the rest of the way. He is 83, after all."</TE>
<TE>   There's hardly a Kelly at Belmont Park who hasn't had something to
do with this horse. While still unraced, Evening Attire was under the
care of the elder Kelly and another of his sons, Larry, at Hialeah in
Florida. Ready to run for the first time in July 2000, the horse had
been turned over to Tim Kelly, another of the current trainer's
brothers. Evening Attire won only one of five starts in 2000, but he
was thrown in with some salty 2-year-olds and the Kellys were hoping
he'd improve and move up the ladder.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, Tim Kelly quit training to join the racing office at the
New York tracks, and his brother Pat became the trainer. Pat Kelly is
more than just the son of somebody whose bronzed plaque hangs in
Saratoga Springs, N.Y. He once won two Grade I races on the same day,
the Man o' War with Solar Splendor and the Woodward with Sultry Song
in 1992, and in 1982 he saddled Laser Lane, the second-place finisher
behind Gato Del Sol in the Kentucky Derby.</TE>
<TE>   Before the 1992 Woodward, Kelly had brought Sultry Song to
California for a win in the Hollywood Gold Cup. For a Southern
California bonus, Kelly was treated to his first earthquake on the
day after the Gold Cup.</TE>
<TE>   This week, reporters have pushed Kelly for his horse-of-the-year
thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly would not be moved. "See me after Saturday's race," he said.</TE>

<DL>ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill.</DL>
<LD>The 19th Breeders' Cup lost a showcase horse Friday when Sky Mesa was
scratched from today's $1-million Juvenile at Arlington Park.</LD>
<LD>   Sky Mesa, who runs for the same team -- owner John Oxley and
trainer John Ward Jr. -- that won the 2001 Kentucky Derby with
Monarchos, was undefeated in three races and was the 3-1 morning-line
favorite. Ward said that the well-bred son of Pulpit and Caress, who
cost Oxley $750,000 at a yearling auction, suffered what appears to
be a sprained right front ankle.</LD>
<LD>   Ward wasn't sure when the injury occurred. Sky Mesa returned to
the barn in good order from a gallop Thursday morning and appeared to
have no problems late Thursday night.</LD>
<TE>   "The best part of it is that there is no evidence of a ...
fracture," Ward said.</TE>
<TE>   Vindication, one of three horses running for trainer Bob Baffert,
becomes the Juvenile favorite.</TE>

<LD>Mike Ditka, who coached the late Walter Payton in Chicago, believes
the Bears' great would have held no malice toward Dallas Cowboy
running back Emmitt Smith for breaking his NFL rushing record.</LD>
<LD>   "I think that Emmitt and Walter are very similar in not only how
they played the game, but how they handled things off the field,"
Ditka said. "They are both very giving people.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think Emmitt or Walter had a selfish bone in them. They
are so similar in the way they handle things -- the public, the fans,
their willingness to help out with charities. I think that's a part
of giving back to the game and they both understand this better than
most. They both gave so much to the game, which is immeasurable in
Walter's eyes."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who has the record for hits given up in a World
Series game?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tough town: Skip Bayless of the San Jose Mercury News wonders if
Art Howe really knows what he's doing leaving the Oakland A's to
manage the New York Mets.</TE>
<TE>   "Howe's nice-guy rapport with the media won't buy him nearly as
much insurance in New York. Mo Vaughn, Roberto Alomar and Mike Piazza
will walk on the poor man as if he's a welcome mat. Welcome to hell,
Art, but congrats on the contract."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second opinion: Newsday's Jon Heyman doesn't like Howe's chances
either:</TE>
<TE>   "Beset by panic and poor taste, the Mets have settled on the worst
possible man for an impossible task.</TE>
<TE>   "Good luck to Art Howe, a nice man with a misleading resume,
misguided confidence and almost no chance to succeed as Mets'
manager....</TE>
<TE>   "The Mets wanted Lou Piniella or Dusty Baker and they got a man
who isn't even their poor cousin. They shot for the moon, and wound
up with Swiss cheese."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Red Sox fans understand: The Arizona football team has plenty of
reasons for wanting to beat Washington State tonight.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest one: The Wildcats haven't won an October game the last
two seasons under Coach John Mackovic.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a curse on this team," receiver Bobby Wade told the
Tucson Citizen.</TE>
<TE>   That curse figures to last until next season. Arizona is 0-3 in
the Pac-10, and Washington State is 3-0.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1990, Wayne Gretzky became the first
NHL player to reach 2,000 career points when he assisted on a goal by
Tomas Sandstrom at 14:32 of the first period of a King game at
Winnipeg.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back again: On this day in 1998, the Mets announced
All-Star catcher Mike Piazza had agreed to a seven-year, $91-million
contract, then the richest deal in baseball history.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Walter Johnson of the Washington Senators gave up
15 hits against the Pittsburgh Pirates in Game 7 of the 1925 World
Series.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: From Jerry Greene of the Orlando Sentinel, commenting
on the World Series TV coverage: "Somebody make Fox stop it with the
gigantic close-up shots of pitchers. There's not a culture on our
planet that finds nose hairs attractive."</TE>

<HD>Clarett in No Rush</HD>
<DH>After creating stir, freshman backs off from saying he'll
challenge NFL draft rule</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Dillman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>COLUMBUS, Ohio</DL>
<LD>An innocent gesture has a way of turning into a symbolic metaphor,
which has a way of morphing into a full-blown Buckeye crisis with
some serious legs around here.</LD>
<LD>   The current issue of ESPN the Magazine has a full-page picture of
star freshman running back Maurice Clarett, tossing aside his Buckeye
game jersey, making it look as if he is heading straight out of
Columbus. "One &amp; Done?" is the headline on the cover.</LD>
<LD>   Pictures and headlines have a way of shaping an issue so much that
the words of a story are sometimes an afterthought. Clarett's own
words made it different, though. He said he was thinking about
challenging the NFL's rule that requires a player to be three years
removed from high school before becoming draft eligible.</LD>
<TE>   Ohio State coaches and officials say they were misled, believing
that the photographer just wanted a shot of Clarett taking off his
jersey after practice.</TE>
<TE>   And more than a week later, the issue was still percolating in
Columbus. It overshadowed the loss of starting right tackle Shane
Olivea, who had an emergency appendectomy Tuesday, and even edged
into talk about the arrival of Joe Paterno and 18th-ranked Penn State
(5-2) for today's Big Ten showdown at fourth-ranked Ohio State (8-0).</TE>
<TE>   Writers were asked not to question Clarett about the magazine
article during Tuesday's media session. Clarett, though, told ESPN's
Kirk Herbstreit that has was planning on returning next year, and
that he was asked a hypothetical question by the magazine writer,
Gene Wojciechowski. The Heisman Trophy candidate also recently said
the same thing to ABC Sports online.</TE>
<TE>   One problem. No one bothered to ask the writer.</TE>
<TE>   "There were never the words, 'What if?' formed in my mouth during
the course of the interview, nor were there any hypotheticals,"
Wojciechowski said Friday. "Was Maurice overwhelmed by the reaction?
Probably so.</TE>
<TE>   "Did he maybe panic a little bit? Probably so. But never was a
scenario given where I asked him if a certain monetary figure were
available to him, would he leave early. I think he's a great kid. All
he ever said was, he was considering the option. He never said he was
going to do it. He said what he said."</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State Coach Jim Tressel calmly downplayed the controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "From an employment standpoint, I don't know if I'll be here three
years from now myself," he said. "I don't know if I'm granted that. I
plan to. Just like I think he plans to. He doesn't have his bags
packed for the Denver Broncos or anything like that.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a freshman. In one way, there's an innocence to that and in
other ways I suppose a danger to that. I hope he doesn't ever mature
into a skeptical, all-these-guys-are-out-to-get me thing. You don't
want that to happen, either."</TE>
<TE>   Said Tim Spencer who coaches the running backs, "I think he didn't
quite understand the scope of how big football and how important it
is to people in this community. He thought he knew but he really
didn't know till it happened. I think he's learning to deal with
that.</TE>
<TE>   " ... I mean, he said what a lot of kids think, but don't say. I
know he's a team player and he's out there to help his team get
better, but when you see it in print, sometimes it looks like you're
just in it for yourself and yourself only. That's not the way he
wanted to come off."</TE>
<TE>   The learning curve may be tougher off the field than on it. He has
rushed for 980 yards and 13 touchdowns, recording six 100-yard games
in seven appearances, and is 147 yards from breaking Robert Smith's
freshman single-season rushing record of 1,126.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing I really worry about right now is beating Penn
State," Clarett said. "The yards, they're going to be there. The
yards will come, whatever. The only thing that's important right now
is beating Penn State. If we lose this week, they're not going to be
talking about 147 yards, they're going to be talking about the
Buckeyes' loss."</TE>
<TE>   Numbers are only numbers,</TE>
<TE>   hence his decision to wear No. 13 as a special tribute to his
hometown of Youngstown, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   "The first year I was playing football, I wore No. 13, and I kind
of took it from there," Clarett said. " ... That's what I started off
with and I'm just taking it back to Square 1.</TE>
<TE>   "Just more reasons, being from Youngstown, against everything.
Everyone says it's a bad-luck number; just going against the grain,
against all odds."</TE>
<TE>   Tressel's connection to Youngstown -- he coached for 15 years at
Youngstown State -- made Clarett's Ohio State decision, well, a
nondecision. Clarett did enjoy a visit from Paterno, though, even
though he had no intention of going to Penn State. "It was cool," he
said. "It was crazy because first you see him on TV as a little kid,
and you're actually standing across from him. He was just talking to
me like this. I was caught up into it." With all the focus on his
maturity, there was one particular telling example of Clarett's
character this season. He scored twice in a 27-16 victory over
Northwestern but also fumbled three times and exchanged heated words
with Spencer on the sideline. Afterward, he impressed his teammates
by standing up and apologizing for the performance.</TE>
<TE>   Look at it this way: Spencer was on the sideline, not Woody Hayes.
Another Buckeye legend, two-time Heisman winner Archie Griffin, now
an associate athletic director, talked about the difference in eras.</TE>
<TE>   "I had that happen to me my freshman year," he said. "The next
game Woody only let me carry the ball one time. Twice, rather. I got
the point."</TE>
<TE>   So did Clarett.</TE>

<HD>Brand a Question for Opening Night</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Elton Brand sweated out another lengthy practice Friday at Los
Angeles Southwest College, dropping into the nearest folding chair
once Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry gave his players the OK to call it
quits. Robbie Davis, the team's assistant trainer, quickly wrapped
two hefty ice packs on Brand's knees.</LD>
<LD>   Brand has been slowly catching up to his fitter teammates after
undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his right knee Sept. 26 and
sitting out most of training camp. He remains uncertain whether he'll
be able to play in the team's regular-season opener Wednesday against
the Cleveland Cavaliers.</LD>
<LD>   "It's pretty up in the air," said Brand, who led the Clippers with
averages of 18.2 points and 11.6 rebounds last season. "I'm trying to
gauge where I am right now. I'm trying to get some of my conditioning
and timing back."</LD>
<TE>   Of starting against the Cavaliers at Staples Center, he added,
"It's definitely not definite."</TE>
<TE>   Said Gentry of Brand: "Conditioning is a factor. His knee is fine.
He's still playing as hard as he ever has. It's not like he could
work out. He had to wait and heal. He couldn't ride a bike. He
couldn't do any cardiovascular work to help his fitness."</TE>
<TE>   Brand suffered what was thought to be a hyper-extended knee while
training with Team USA in preparation for the World Championships in
August. He was injured after trying to block guard Andre Miller's
layup.</TE>
<TE>   Brand cut short his play at the World Championships after
averaging 6.9 points and 4.1 rebounds in eight games. An initial MRI
was negative, but a second revealed torn knee cartilage.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't complain about the injuries," said Brand, who played in
80 of 82 games last season despite suffering a variety of nagging
knee and elbow injuries. "You have to go out and play."</TE>
<TE>   If Brand cannot play opening night, the Clippers could be without
their starting front line of Brand, center Michael Olowokandi and
small forward Lamar Odom.</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi has a strained left hip flexor after sitting out most
of training camp because of tendinitis in his left knee. His status
is day-to-day. Odom will spend at least the first month of the season
on the injured list because of a sprained right ankle. Cherokee
Parks, Sean Rooks and Corey Maggette could start in their places
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   -- Elliott Teaford</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers have until Monday to cut their roster to 15 players,
which means three players--Odom, Melvin Ely (sore toe) and Bryant
Stith (knee)--probably will be moved to the injured list.</TE>
<TE>   Free-agent forward Mike Batiste is expected to be waived, leaving
Gentry and General Manager Elgin Baylor a difficult choice for the
final roster spot. The team will practice twice today and twice
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "On Monday morning, we'll zero in on who's going to be ready to
play or not," Gentry said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Denver Nugget forward Juwan Howard was suspended for two games and
fined $15,000 by the NBA for throwing punches at Indiana's Al
Harrington and Jermaine O'Neal during an exhibition game.</TE>
<TE>   Howard swung at the players with 4:56 left in Denver's 96-89 loss
to the Pacers on Wednesday night. He will sit out the first two games
of the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Garnett and the Minnesota Timberwolves are negotiating an
extension to the largest contract in NBA history, the $126-million
deal he signed in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The All-Star forward has two seasons left on the contract that
pays an average of $21 million a year. He is eligible for an
extension worth up to $139 million over four years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 76er forward Monty Williams will have arthroscopic
surgery because of torn cartilage in his left knee.</TE>
<TE>   In other 76er news, Samuel Dalembert had arthroscopic surgery on
his left knee and is expected to be out 12 weeks.</TE>

<HD>Oates Out at Least a Month</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>EDMONTON, Canada</DL>
<LD>Adam Oates, who signed as a free agent with the Mighty Ducks in the
off-season, will have surgery today to have screws put in his broken
left hand.</LD>
<LD>   Oates, 41, suffered two broken bones in his hand after being
slashed in Thursday's 2-2 tie with Vancouver. The timetable for his
return will be determined after the surgery, but he will be sidelined
at least a month.</LD>
<LD>   "You don't replace a guy like Adam Oates," Coach Mike Babcock
said. "He is so strong on the power play and faceoffs. This is a big
thing. That's reality. But this does provide an opportunity. Someone
else is going to get ice time. For the long-term, that may help us."</LD>
<TE>   On a positive note, center is the one position where the Ducks
have depth. They will be able to fill out four lines with proven NHL
centers -- Steve Rucchin, Andy McDonald, Matt Cullen and Marc
Chouinard.</TE>
<TE>   "No one can take [Adam's] place," Rucchin said. "We all have to
try to chip in a little extra. Adam is not only a great offensive
center, he is a great two-way center."</TE>
<TE>   Oates' absence will be felt the most on the power play, where his
skill on the half-board is effective. The Ducks have scored seven
power-play goals in seven games this season. They didn't score seven
until their 13th game last season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge loss for us," Duck captain Paul Kariya said.
"Hopefully, he heals quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Oates has played 243 of 246 games over the last three seasons. He
signed a one-year, $3.5-million contract plus a team option, which
becomes automatic if Oates and the team reach certain incentives, one
being the Ducks qualifying for the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Bryan Murray said the team would not make a roster
move until after tonight's game. Centers Jason Krog and Samuel
Pahlsson are candidates to be recalled from minor league Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What caused the Ducks to disintegrate over the last three seasons?
Can the team be revived? Is there a buyer on the horizon? Will the
franchise be moved if attendance hovers around the 6,000-8,000 level?</TE>
<TE>   All good questions. But Disney spokeswoman Leslie Goodman  said
that Chief Executive Michael Eisner won't discuss the Ducks now.</TE>
<TE>   "The focus is on baseball now," Goodman said.</TE>
<TE>   Now, if the Ducks, like the Angels, make the playoffs....</TE>

<HD>Double Play</HD>
<DH>Reed provides plenty of highlights for Temple City on
offense and defense</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ben Bolch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>

<LD>Desmond Reed plays like the superhuman creation of some madcap video
game programmer. The two-way standout from Temple City High seems to
have the vision of an eagle and the acceleration of a cheetah.</LD>
<LD>   He makes an impact on nearly every play and possesses the
intangibles that make his coach wish he could sign him to a 10-year
contract.</LD>
<LD>   "Watch this," Temple City Coach Mike Mooney says, tapping his
finger on a two-inch image of Reed on a television screen. A moment
later the wide receiver makes two downfield blocks to spring a Ram
running back for a touchdown.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the thing that separates him from the other superstars,"
Mooney says. "He does the little things. He never takes plays off."</TE>
<TE>   Mooney then hits the fast-forward button to another highlight, in
which Reed comes across the field from his free safety position to
make a touchdown-saving tackle.</TE>
<TE>   "He never gives up," the coach says. "He's always competing."</TE>
<TE>   Finally comes the piece de resistance, a 90-yard kickoff return
for a touchdown on the first play of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "He's always going forward," Mooney says. "There's no wasted
movement."</TE>
<TE>   Other coaches in the Rio Hondo League wish they could confine Reed
to a television screen or the insides of a video game console, but
they're stuck with him for the rest of this season, until the senior
signs with a major Division I college and starts playing on
Saturdays.</TE>
<TE>   They must contend with one of the most versatile players in
Southern California, a 5-foot-9, 180-pound mighty mite who holds six
school career records, among them 31 interceptions, 3,204 yards
receiving and 13 punt and kickoff returns for touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time he's on the field, he's a threat to make something
happen," says Steve Garrison, coach of undefeated league rival
Monrovia.</TE>
<TE>   There are several multitalented two-way players -- among them
Steve Smith of Woodland Hills Taft and Mark Bradford of Fremont, both
of whom play receiver and defensive back -- but Reed plays in the
relative obscurity of the Southern Section's Division X.</TE>
<TE>   Performances like his Friday against South Pasadena have assured
he didn't remain a secret for long. In a 49-14 victory, Reed scored a
school-record six touchdowns -- three rushing and two on fumble
returns after he took the opening kickoff 90 yards for a score.</TE>
<TE>   In the first quarter, he had the kickoff return, made two
interceptions and ran 95 yards for a touchdown after stripping the
ball from South Pasadena's running back.</TE>
<TE>   Reed finished with 111 yards rushing in 14 carries and was on the
field for 84 of 108 plays before leaving the game with 8 minutes 51
seconds left. He rested only during kickoffs, punt coverage plays,
field-goal tries and extra-point attempts.</TE>
<TE>   After Temple City had improved to 4-3 overall, 2-0 in league, Reed
grabbed a chunk of turf as a keepsake and explained, "I was just
excited to come out and play."</TE>
<TE>   The only four-year varsity player in school history, Reed has been
making big plays since arriving on campus for a summer passing
league. After playing cornerback exclusively as a freshman, the next
season Reed was made a receiver in Mooney's spread offense and he
began returning kickoffs and punts.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed to have this guy on both sides of the ball," Mooney
explains.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Reed added a new line to his job description: running
back. In an effort to free Reed from the constraints of double- and
triple-coverage he faced as a receiver, Mooney put his star in the
backfield and had him carry 21 times for 123 yards and a touchdown.
Reed also made three receptions for 86 yards, returned a punt 35
yards for a touchdown and returned one of his two interceptions 75
yards for another score.</TE>
<TE>   Reed is as easygoing off the field as he is electric on it. "I
just like to have the ball in my hands," he says. "Whatever I can do
to help the team is best for me."</TE>
<TE>   He does more than just make plays for the Rams. Reed leads by
example in the weight room, where he bench presses more than any
other player, and in team drills, nearly all of which he wins. He
also organizes team dinners on Sunday nights.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a leader," says senior lineman Chris Datolla, another
two-way player who has known Reed since their youth football days.
"He tries to do things to make us closer."</TE>
<TE>   Reed earns the respect of his teammates by always going full bore
when the ball goes to someone else and never sulking when his team is
not performing well. The only negative trait that Reed might engender
in his teammates is jealousy.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a player with a 41-inch vertical leap who can run the
40-yard dash in 4.5 seconds. He possesses tremendous vision when it
comes to spotting holes and maintains perfect balance while making
cuts. On defense, he has a preternatural ability to break on the ball
and go for the interception at precisely the right moment.</TE>
<TE>   And he can seamlessly shift into overdrive on kick returns.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't have blazing speed," Mooney says, "but I've never seen
anybody who goes from standing still to full speed as fast as he
does."</TE>
<TE>   Reed isn't fully satisfied with his accomplishments, wanting
desperately to set the school's single-season interception record. He
has eight interceptions through seven games and needs five more to
break the record.</TE>
<TE>   Reed thinks his strength is at cornerback, where he has spent much
of his high school career and will likely wind up in college. Nearly
every school in the Pacific 10 is recruiting him.</TE>
<TE>   Reed has returned an interception for a touchdown six times during
a career in which extraordinary feats have become commonplace.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm kind of used to it since I've been playing with him so long,"
says teammate Datolla. "But when I look at it on our highlight films,
it does amaze me."</TE>
<TE>   It might even amaze video game zealots already accustomed to such
otherworldly feats.</TE>

<LD>The Barstow boys and the Felton San Lorenzo Valley girls won the
Division III-IV-V team sweepstakes titles in the Mt. San Antonio
College cross-country meet on Friday while running in the rain.</LD>
<LD>   Barstow, the defending state Division III boys' champion, totaled
87 points. Castroville North Monterrey County placed second with 117
points and Santa Margarita was third with 141.</LD>
<LD>   Barstow, the No. 4-ranked team in the Southland by The Times,
placed four runners among the top 19 finishers.</LD>
<TE>   Junior Avery Himes paced the Aztecs with a ninth-place time of 15
minutes 43 seconds over the 2.91-mile course.</TE>
<TE>   San Lorenzo Valley, led by individual winner Raquel Barrientos,
defeated Moraga Campolindo, 71-79, for the girls' title.</TE>
<TE>   Barrientos, a senior, clocked 17:58 to defeat junior Lindsay
Flacks of North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake by 13 seconds with the
fastest girls' time of the meet.</TE>
<TE>   San Lorenzo Valley also produced the fastest boys' time as junior
Alex Dunn won the team sweepstakes in 15:00.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-3 Dunn was pushed by senior Humberto Rojas of Costa
Mesa Estancia for the first two miles before pulling away to victory.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Mike Powers of Santa Margarita finished second in 15:10
with Rojas third in 15:18.</TE>
<TE>   "I just concentrated on working the downhills," Dunn said.
"[Rojas] would pass me on the uphills, but then I would work the
downhills."</TE>
<TE>   The meet continues at 7:15 a.m. today. The Division I-II team and
individual sweepstakes start at 9 a.m.</TE>

<TE>   Lauren Ervin, who averaged 21 points and 15 rebounds as a junior
before leaving Artesia High late last season, said she has committed
to play basketball at Kansas.</TE>
<TE>   A 6-3 center-forward, Ervin helped Torrance Bishop Montgomery win
a state title as a freshman and will play at Inglewood this season.
She chose Kansas over Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an extremely tough decision because of Tennessee's
program, the people, the coaches, but my heart was telling me to go
to Kansas," she said.</TE>

<TE>   Andrew Kartunen, a senior goalkeeper at San Clemente, has

<TE>   Moreno Valley has forfeited its 19-17 victory over Lake Elsinore
Temescal Canyon in Week 1 of the football season because of a
paperwork error concerning the transfer of linebacker Chris Lopez,
the Southern Section confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez transferred from Riverside Notre Dame during the 2001-02
school year, moving from the Moreno Valley Valley View attendance
area into the Moreno Valley area. Under the section's rule, if the
player would have been immediately eligible with the proper
paperwork, failure to submit that paperwork results in no more than
one forfeit.</TE>
<TE>   With the forfeit, Moreno Valley falls to 5-1 entering play Friday
and Temescal Canyon improves to 2-4.</TE>

<TE>   Cindy Kramer resigned as softball coach at Sherman Oaks Notre Dame
after nine seasons and six playoff appearances.</TE>

it was a mutual decision to allow Kramer to be a trainer year-round.</TE>

<HD>Venice Relies on Ellis, Defense for Victory</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With big-play receivers on both sides of him, Venice running back
Byron Ellis is often an afterthought in the Gondoliers' high-octane
offense. On Friday night, Ellis became the main man in a key Western
League game.</LD>
<LD>   Ellis ran for 184 yards in 18 carries and scored two touchdowns
for visiting Venice, which took over first place as the only unbeaten
team in league with a 20-6 victory over Westchester.</LD>
<LD>   The Gondoliers (6-1, 3-0 in league) won without the fireworks that
had helped them average 42 points heading into the game. An
overlooked defense also played its part in holding the Comets (5-2,
2-1) without an offensive touchdown.</LD>
<TE>   "In a tough game, you rely on your defense," Venice Coach Angelo
Gasca said. "Defense wins championships. Tonight, they played great."</TE>
<TE>   Ellis got going in the first quarter, when he had runs of 14 and
12 yards on a seven-play drive. Then on first and 10 at the
Westchester 27, the senior went through a hole on the right side and
rambled to a touchdown for a 6-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually I get about seven carries a game," he said. "I let it
loose as soon as I got the ball. Coach [Gasca] told me to run hard.
Once he sees something he likes, he'll go with it."</TE>
<TE>   Westchester tied the score when senior Wallace Hightower blocked a
punt deep in Venice territory. Rashard Smith picked up the ball
inside the five-yard line and fell into the end zone. Hightower's
conversion kick was blocked by B.J. Vickers.</TE>
<TE>   Vickers got loose late in the second quarter. The 6-foot-3 wide
receiver made an adjustment on an underthrown pass by Miller,
breaking a tackle near the right sideline to complete a 46-yard
scoring play and give the Gondoliers a 13-6 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Ellis had another 42-yard run but fumbled the ball away. As the
Gondoliers' defense held, he atoned for the mistake with a 41-yard
jaunt on third and 30 to break the Comets' spirit. With 2:35
remaining, he finished the drive with a four-yard run on a fake
reverse.</TE>
<TE>   Venice got solid games from quarterback Eddie Miller (13 for 21,
174 yards) and Vickers (five catches, 97 yards).</TE>

touchdowns. He added 39 yards in six carries and scored on a 14-yard
run in the third quarter.</TE>

<TE>   On its next possession, Franklin (6-1, 2-0) drove 86 yards in nine
plays, capped by a 10-yard pass from Diaz to Kitt Turner with 24
seconds to play in the first half to build a 28-10 halftime lead.</TE>

Parrots in a Sunset Six League game.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Dickson scored on a 25-yard run on the first play from
scrimmage for Grant (5-2, 2-0), but the junior, who came into the
game with more than 1,100 yards rushing on the season, sprained his
left ankle on his second carry midway through the first quarter and
did not return.</TE>
<TE>   The Parrots (4-3, 1-1) capitalized on three first-half Lancer
turnovers to score 21 unanswered points, culminated by a seven-yard
touchdown run by James Ingram with 7:49 left in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Grant scored 24 unanswered points, highlighted by two Smith
touchdown passes, to take a 31-21 lead with 7:42 left in the third
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Poly led, 35-31, after a 53-yard interception return by Durrell
Marzett near the end of the third quarter, but Mark Diaz had three
passes intercepted in the fourth quarter, two of which Grant
converted into touchdowns.</TE>

<HD>Mission Viejo Can't Be Stopped</HD>
<DH>San Clemente has five turnovers and Diablos take advantage
in a 49-14 South Coast League victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martin Henderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Turnovers. Breaks. Opportunities. Those are things that San Clemente
couldn't afford to give Mission Viejo if it hoped to end the Diablos'
two-season win streak Friday.</LD>
<LD>   But knowing what to do, and doing it, are entirely different
things.</LD>
<LD>   And so San Clemente stumbled, and Mission Viejo walked tall for
the 21st consecutive game, a 49-14 home victory over its primary
South Coast League rival.</LD>
<TE>   The Diablos (7-0, 2-0 in league), ranked No. 3 by The Times and
No. 1 in the Southern Section Division II poll, took advantage of
good field position and another key performance by Marty Tadman to
put away No. 15 San Clemente (4-3, 1-1).</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo scored 21 of its first 35 points after breakdowns in
San Clemente's offense or special teams. It scored touchdowns after
taking possession at San Clemente's 41 and 40, at midfield, at the
Tritons' 20, and twice from its own 34.</TE>
<TE>   The pivotal moment came in the second quarter. Tadman intercepted
his fifth pass of the season and returned it 25 yards for a touchdown
with 8 minutes 51 seconds left, igniting a second-quarter onslaught
in which Mission Viejo scored 21 points to take a 28-7 halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   Tadman's interception return gave Mission Viejo a 14-7 lead. It
came after the Diablo offense drove to the seven-yard line, only to
be pushed back and miss a 35-yard field-goal attempt. His
interception of Cole Bergquist's pass on the 25-yard line turned the
tide, though.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of momentum sticking with San Clemente after the big
defensive stand, it turned in favor of Mission Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   "We were deflated after that," Triton Coach Eric Patton said..</TE>
<TE>   On San Clemente's next possession, the ball was snapped past
punter Chris Miller into the end zone. Miller recovered the ball and
got the punt off, but Mission Viejo got the ball at the Triton 40.
Jamielle Gummer ran for 27 yards and twice for four yards to get the
ball to the five-yard line. Ryan Holmes then scored for a 21-7 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The defense -- anchored by Chris Cole, Justin Williams and Chad
Moline -- allowed San Clemente 153 yards, 52 in the first half, and
forced five turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Holmes rushed for 111 yards and touchdown runs of five and two
yards. Gummer rushed for 55 yards, scoring on runs of eight and one
yard.</TE>

<LD>Reaganomics was in full swing, Depeche Mode was topping the pop
charts, and Encino Crespi's Russell White was running wild at the
high school level the last time Bellflower St. John Bosco defeated
Los Angeles Loyola in a football game.</LD>
<LD>   It was 1986 when the Braves last lived up to their name against
LoyolaBut the streak finally came to an end Friday at St. John Bosco
when two running backs hit the 100-yard mark and the Braves
completely shut down Loyola in the first half of a 26-14 Serra League
victory.</LD>
<LD>   Derrick Williams rushed for 100 yards and two touchdowns and
Terrance King rushed for 101 yards for St. John Bosco (5-2, 0-2 in
league), which finally put the game out of reach on a 25-yard
touchdown run by Williams with 2:44 left.</LD>
<TE>   "They're great backs," St. John Bosco Coach Kiki Mendoza said.
"We've got size up front. We should be able to run the ball on
people. For us, it comes down to stopping other teams' offense."</TE>
<TE>   The Braves, ranked No. 23 by The Times and No. 9 in the Southern
Section Division I coaches' poll, did that with ease on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola (5-2, 0-2), ranked No. 13 by The Times and No. 6 in
Division I, was stymied in the first half, gaining only 13 yards and
two first downs.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Scott Deke, making his first start at quarterback for
Loyola, completed seven of 15 passes for 76 yards with one
interception.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Bo Renaud was the extent of the Loyola offense, gaining 123
yards in 27 carries and scoring two touchdowns.</TE>

<TE>   Chino 26, La Verne Damien 21 -- Brian Pedro and Kes Ekpre-Olomo
have not been regular fixtures in Chino's defense this season, but
both made key plays to lift the Cowboys in the Sierra League game at
Chino.</TE>
<TE>   Pedro, playing in place of cornerback Nathaniel Jackson, who
didn't play after missing practice with the flu, intercepted two
passes. His second came in Chino's end zone with seven minutes left
and the Cowboys clinging to a 23-21 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Ekpre-Olomo was the main contributor on offense for Chino, rushing
for 186 yards in 30 carries, but made his biggest play on Damien's
last offensive drive.</TE>
<TE>   Ekpre-Olomo, making his first defensive appearance in three years,
sacked quarterback Nick Davila at midfield for a seven-yard loss on
third-and-six with 29 seconds remaining. Davila then threw incomplete
on the next play and Chino escaped with the victory.</TE>
<TE>   The No. 2 Cowboys (7-0, 2-0) came back from an early eight-point
deficit to tie the score, 14-14, at the half.</TE>
<TE>   Damien (5-2, 1-1), ranked No. 21, moved back ahead, 21-14, on Dan
Johnson's six-yard run midway through the third quarter. Kyle
Lucariello kicked a 32-yard field goal -- Chino's first of the season
-- to cut the lead to 21-17.</TE>
<TE>   Chino running back Jacob Flowe played sparingly because of an
injured ankle, but he scored on two short touchdown runs, the second
giving the Cowboys a 23-21 lead with 8:11 left.</TE>

<TE>   Newhall Hart 35, Canyon Country Canyon 9 -- Sophomore Ryan Wolfe
caught a 33-yard touchdown pass on the final play of the third
quarter to break open a close game and lift Hart to its 55th
consecutive Foothill League victory at College of the Canyons.</TE>
<TE>   The No. 5 Indians (6-0-1, 2-0), ranked No. 2 in Division II, held
Canyon (6-1, 1-1) to 54 yards in the second half after clinging to a
14-9 halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Sean Norton completed 15 of 26 passes for 300 yards
and two touchdowns. He has thrown 210 passes this season without an
interception.</TE>
<TE>   Billy Maria of Canyon came through with the game's most dramatic
play on the final down of the first half. He blocked a 42-yard field
goal, picked up the loose ball and raced 61 yards for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Nate Longshore of Canyon, No. 9 in Division II,
completed 10 of 31 passes for 106 yards.</TE>

two, one, two and 15 yards to lead Carpinteria in a Tri-Valley League
game at Oaks Christian.</TE>
<TE>   The Warriors (7-0, 4-0), No. 1 in Division XI, took a 21-0 lead
with 6:44 left in the third quarter on Gonzales' third touchdown to
cap a 10-play, 67-yard drive.</TE>
<TE>   Oaks Christian (6-1, 2-1), No. 3 in Division XI, got 115 yards
rushing in 20 carries by Aaron Ware. He played extensively for the

<TE>   Gardena Serra 9, L.A. Cathedral 8 -- Jonathan Champion kicked a
game-winning 24-yard field goal with three seconds remaining to lead
the Cavaliers over the Phantoms in a Del Rey League game at Serra.</TE>
<TE>   The Phantoms (6-1, 1-1), ranked No. 5 in Division X, scored first
on a one-yard run by Devin Martinez, then added a two-point
conversion, making it 8-0 with 3:02 left in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Serra (7-0, 2-0), ranked No. 1 in Division X, got on the board
5:33 into the third quarter, when Corey Jones found Devin Stearns on

two-point conversion.</TE>

<LD>   There are also seven live races at Oak Tree, the first of which
comes at 9:45 a.m. After taking time off for the Breeders' Cup, the
card is scheduled to resume at 3:05 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   While the local circuit's other top riders are in Illinois, Laffit
Pincay will be busy at home. The world's winningest jockey has mounts
in six of the races. After sitting out the opener, Pincay will ride
Pacific Colony in the second, likely favorite Orange'em in the third,
live longshot Dotage in the fourth, recent winner Jaklin's Last Kin
in the fifth, comebacker Don't Holler in the sixth and maiden Miss
Freedom in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   The main event as Keeneland wraps up its meet is the
$150,000-added Fayette, a Grade III at 1 1/8 miles.</TE>
<TE>   The Fayette attracted only five entrants, topped by Tenpins, who
has won six of nine for trainer Don Winfree and is two for two at the
track.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The sixth at Santa Anita has attracted a field of
12. Besides Don't Holler, other prime contenders are Greenland,
Torsionnaire and Well Struck.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Shescominundone. The 3-year-old gray daughter of
Runaway Groom won her third race of the Oak Tree meet when she took
Friday's second.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Bay Meadows. The powers that be at the Northern
California track apparently believe their races are as important as
the Breeders' Cup as they will go head-to-head with the Breeders' Cup
for almost three hours.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Academy Spy, Habaneros and
Pacific Colony in the second, singling Orange'em in the third and Is
It True Mex, Kolinor, Champ's Star, Martel and Royal Highlander in
the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 4/48. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $22.60/$273.60. Total money bet: $326.</TE>

<HD>Injury Again Sidelines Palffy</HD>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Ziggy Palffy, his strained left groin bothering him again, sat out
Friday night's game against the New York Rangers.</LD>
<LD>   Palffy was sidelined for three games after suffering the injury
Oct. 12 but returned to the lineup Wednesday night and played nearly
23 minutes against the Detroit Red Wings. He had an assist and led
the Kings with five shots on goal in a 3-3 tie.</LD>
<LD>   But the Slovak winger left the ice only a few minutes into
Friday's morning skate at Madison Square Garden, retreating to the
trainer's room.</LD>
<TE>   "His groin is a little tender," Coach Andy Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   Palffy's status for Sunday's game against the Columbus Blue
Jackets at Columbus, Ohio, was uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd like to have him in our lineup," Murray said. "It will just
take its course and when he's ready to play, he'll play for us.
That's just the way it is. You get injured players during the year."</TE>
<TE>   Derek Armstrong, acquired by the Kings in a July trade that sent a
conditional 2003 draft pick to the Rangers, replaced Palffy in
Friday's lineup. Armstrong, 29, played in only seven NHL games in
three seasons with the Rangers before trying to force a trade by
playing in Switzerland last season.</TE>
<TE>   He started the season in the minors but scored a goal in a 2-2 tie
with the Vancouver Canucks last Saturday, his first NHL goal since
the 1997-98 season.</TE>
<TE>   "I take it day by day up here," he said. "If they tell me to clean
the toilets, I'll clean the toilets."</TE>

<HD>Kings Work Quickly</HD>
<DH>They score three times in first period and beat Rangers,
6-2. Deadmarsh gets a hat trick.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The booing started midway through the first period, the derisive
chanting ("re-fund, re-fund") early in the second.</LD>
<LD>   Near the end, a disgusted fan threw his jersey onto the ice.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings sent a riled mob into the bustling streets of Manhattan
late Friday night, dominating the slow-starting New York Rangers in a
6-2 victory in front of an angry sellout crowd of 18,200 at Madison
Square Garden.</LD>
<TE>   The first of three goals by Adam Deadmarsh, whose hat trick was
his first in 101 games with the Kings, and goals by Bryan Smolinski
and rookie Alexander Frolov gave the Kings a 3-0 lead only 11 minutes
8 seconds into the game.</TE>
<TE>   Derek Armstrong, acquired in an off-season trade with the Rangers,
also scored for the Kings, whose victory was their first in four
games and extended the home team's winless streak to five games,
among them three consecutive losses.</TE>
<TE>   Goaltender Felix Potvin, whose record against the Rangers was his
worst against any NHL opponent, was called upon to stop only 18 shots
in winning for only the second time in eight decisions against the
Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   Less than eight minutes into the second period, the Kings led,
4-0.</TE>
<TE>   "We came out the way we wanted, the way we have been when we're
rested," King defenseman Mathieu Schneider said. "There aren't a lot
of teams that can really handle our speed when we jump on them right
away, and these guys hadn't seen us. I think we caught them by
surprise and they were off their game.</TE>
<TE>   "That makes our game easier. When you can get a jump on a team
like that, it makes life a lot easier the rest of the night."</TE>
<TE>   It was only nine months ago that the Kings ended a 10-game,
12-year winless streak in the Garden with a 4-0 victory Jan. 9. And
they found out earlier in the day that they'd again be without
high-scoring winger Ziggy Palffy, who sat out for the fourth time in
five games because of a strained groin.</TE>
<TE>   But the Rangers, whose last-place standing in the Atlantic
Division despite a star-studded roster and one of the league's
highest payrolls makes them an easy target for disgruntled fans, were
on their heels from the beginning, Deadmarsh scoring a power-play
goal on a rebound at 5:26 to start the onslaught.</TE>
<TE>   After Smolinski scored on a shot from the right circle at 10:54
and Frolov scored on a breakaway at 11:08, the first NHL goal for the
Russian right wing, Ranger Coach Bryan Trottier pulled goaltender
Mike Richter for Daniel Blackburn.</TE>
<TE>   And when Armstrong beat Blackburn on a rebound at 7:20 of the
second period, making the score 4-0, the chanting from the crowd only
got uglier.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to give ourselves some credit," King Coach Andy Murray
said, indicating that the Garden crowd should too. "We are not an
easy team to play against, and we were going right from the drop of
the puck.</TE>
<TE>   "The first 30 minutes of the game, we were unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   Deadmarsh scored his second power-play goal on a deflection at
2:33 of the third period. He scored his third goal, at even strength,
on a breakaway at 13:01 after taking a pass from Jason Allison, who
had three assists.</TE>
<TE>   The hat trick was the second of his career, his first since he
scored three goals for the Colorado Avalanche against the Edmonton
Oilers on Jan. 5, 2000. But he seemed almost embarrassed by it. He
scored his second goal simply by getting in the way of a shot by
Smolinski, the puck ricocheting off his right wrist.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't even see it," he said. "It's obviously a cheesy goal for
me."</TE>

<LD>Memo to: Mike Scioscia</LD>
<LD>   From: Despondent Dodger fan</LD>
<LD>   Re: Armageddon</LD>
<TE>   There is no question about the fantastic job by you and the Angels
this season. But we are now facing a situation of unprecedented
peril: The Giants are on the threshold of their first title in San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   You owe it to humanity to avert such a travesty of justice.</TE>
<TE>   As such, during Game 6 tonight, if your starter clearly doesn't
have his stuff, please feel free to go to the bullpen before the dam
bursts. I understand your desire to stay the course, to maintain the
formula that got you here; but in this critical situation, please
consider calling an audible.</TE>
<TE>   And, if you should need to go to the bullpen, and you look into
that pen and find that the dude with the beard and goggles is
available ... please go to the guy next to him.</TE>

<TE>   I am a lifelong Angel fan, and I just want to thank Bill Plaschke
for ripping Garret Anderson for his lackadaisical play. I agree, he
dogs it all the time. He never runs hard on a grounder (I have been
pointing to that example against the Yankees every time he comes up
to bat) and he rarely tries in the outfield. The other night, when he
actually made a good play, I was completely surprised.</TE>
<TE>   I wish I had tape of all the Angel games so I could count how many
times Anderson dogged it on a play, how many times that guy ended up
scoring, and how many times that cost them the game.</TE>
<TE>   Now, obviously, Anderson has been a big part of the offense and
has come through for the team many times. When he does well, I do
cheer him on. He's like my least favorite child. Usually, his actions
bother me, but if he comes through, it makes me happy.</TE>

<TE>   9. "Great. My latte is cold and my sushi is warm."</TE>
<TE>   8. "Beat L.A.! Beat L.A.!"</TE>
<TE>   7. "Does this orange and black Windbreaker clash with my Dockers?"</TE>
<TE>   6. "Here are your garlic fries. Boy, that line was long. What
inning is it? The seventh? What did I miss?"</TE>
<TE>   5. "I hope they wrap this game up early. I've got a meeting at the
Anarchist Gay and Lesbian Farmers Co-op Homeless Shelter Foundation
at 11 tonight."</TE>
<TE>   4. "I missed that home run, there was a (rail/beam/wall)
obstructing my view."</TE>
<TE>   3. "I paid $1,300 for these tickets. That's nearly one-quarter
what I pay for rent in my unfurnished studio apartment in the
Tenderloin."</TE>
<TE>   2. "I can't feel my (toes/nose/fingers)."</TE>
<TE>   "What do you mean I'm not a real Giant fan? I've been coming to
Pac Bell for 20 years now."</TE>

<TE>   Mike Penner's column on baseball's "worthless" greatest moments
was priceless.</TE>
<TE>   Once upon a time, baseball was about who won, not the
dissemination of mind-numbing stats (most relief wins by a relief
pitcher with acid reflux on Tuesdays).</TE>
<TE>   Forgotten is the game's ultimate hit: Bill Mazeroski's home run in
the bottom of the ninth inning to break a 9-9 tie in Game 7 of the
1960 World Series. However, it had three strikes against it: It
happened in Pittsburgh, for Pittsburgh and against the Yankees.</TE>

<TE>   Is Dusty Baker running a major league team or a day-care center?</TE>

<TE>   Can we please find a way to support our Angels other than those
incredibly annoying noise sticks? Trying to see in and around them
and being poked with them by the people around me the entire game is
taking away what is otherwise sheer elation at how the team is
performing.</TE>
<TE>   I've been to plenty of games and stadiums that have "rocked"
without the use of these annoying advertising tools.</TE>

<LD>John Creager, who ranks fourth among jockeys at Los Alamitos with
2,108 victories, has decided to retire.</LD>
<LD>   A member of the local colony for 25 years, Creager, 51, will
become a trainer at Ed Allred's Rolling A Ranch in Atascadero.</LD>
<LD>   Creager, who is seventh among Los Alamitos jockeys with 86 stakes
victories, has ridden such stars as Down With Debt, Sgt Pepper
Feature, Griswold, Chicks Beduino, Florentine, Ah Sigh, Prissy Fein
and Jodys Glory.</LD>
<TE>   Creager, who was born in Odgen, Utah, says the most memorable
moment he had as a rider was when he and Sgt Pepper Feature beat
Denim N Diamonds in the 1982 Champion of Champions.</TE>
<TE>   "The buildup to that showdown was a lot of fun," he said. "Sgt
Pepper Feature was unique in that he could break behind the best
horses and still win. Not too many racehorses are able to do that
consistently at the top level.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been lucky. People have been good to me and I rode a lot of
great horses over the years. It'll be fun to work with the babies at
the ranch because that's what I've done all of my life. I'm looking
forward to the experience."</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Its Sinful. 2. Recite. 3. La Bamba Chick. 4.
Vagabondia. 5. Hope I Fly. 6. Slamat. 7. Moved. 8. Ken Mars Secret.
9. Boeagle. 10. Solar Dash. 11. One Big Love.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Its Sinful and Dreams To Fill in the first, Recite and
the entry of Tetris-Knowntoman in the second, Tiene Mucho Blanco, Lee
Special Lee and La Bamba Chick in the third and Vagabondia and
Sunshine Belle in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: First Royal Beduino should improve second time
out in the fifth for trainer Blane Schvaneveldt. Harney drops out of
a tougher spot to go in the 10th.</TE>
<TE>   Post Time: 6:30 p.m.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Having been distracted by a World Series in which the hitters should
be forced to swing noise sticks to compensate for the pitiful
pitching, let's see if I have this right:</LD>
<LD>   * The New York Mets, unwilling to wait for Dusty Baker and unable
(or is that unwilling as well?) to meet the compensation demands of
the Seattle Mariners for negotiating rights to Lou Piniella, were
suddenly willing to settle on Art Howe as their next manager,
agreeing to overpay (four years, $9.4 million) a man the Oakland A's
seemed eager to show the door.</LD>
<LD>   * Piniella, upset at the Mariners for not allowing him to
negotiate with the Mets but eager to manage a team in the same time
zone at least as his Tampa home, had his options reduced to basement
time with the hometown Devil Rays. They surprisingly stepped up with
a four-year, $14-million contract that isn't worth anything unless
Piniella has decision-making influence on General Manager Chuck LaMar
and bumptious owner Vince Naimoli, who so far hasn't managed to spoil
property values in the gated community where Piniella also lives.</LD>
<TE>   * The A's, who wouldn't allow bench coach Ken Macha to interview
with the Boston Red Sox last spring but didn't hesitate in letting
Howe meet with the Mets and didn't demand compensation for letting
him out of the last year of his contract, will now elevate Macha, who
a) was just about everyone's choice as the best interviewee among
managerial candidates from coast to coast, b) chose to remain with
the A's over a multiyear managerial offer from the Milwaukee Brewers
and c) coached with the Angels under Buck Rodgers  and Marcel
Lachemann in the early '90s, when he wasn't the hot ticket that he
became during the current managerial merry-go-round.</TE>
<TE>   * The Brewers, snubbed by Macha, apparently will now focus on the
four other candidates they have interviewed -- Arizona bench coach
Bob Melvin (no relation to new Milwaukee General Manager Doug
Melvin), Brewer bench coach Cecil Cooper, New York Yankee third base
coach Willie Randolph and Atlanta third base coach Ned Yost -- with
Melvin and Yost thought to be the front-runners for a task more
foreboding than trying to pick a winner in the nightly sausage race
at Miller Park.</TE>
<TE>   * The Mariners, dumped by Piniella, late in jumping on the Macha
bandwagon and probably unwilling to meet what are expected to be
industry-high salary demands by Dusty Baker, have a long list of
candidates, including such former managers as Don Baylor, Cito
Gaston, Phil Garner and Lee Elia, along with Angel pitching coach Bud
Black, who has never managed, a probable drawback for a club that
figures to contend again in the wickedly competitive American League
West, a division enhanced when the Texas Rangers beat several of
these same teams to Buck Showalter, who will join Texas owner Tom
Hicks and General Manager John Hart in a union of micro-managers.</TE>
<TE>   * The Chicago Cubs, who liked both Showalter and what they heard
from Macha and may have Bobby Valentine as a fallback, have put their
search on hold because of a willingness to do what the Mets wouldn't,
which is wait to talk with Baker when he becomes a free agent --
either later tonight if the San Francisco Giants win the World Series
by defeating the Angels in Game 6 or after Sunday night's Game 7, no
matter who wins.</TE>
<TE>   All of this has kept the rumor mill grinding and annoyed
Commissioner Bud Selig, who has a gag order banning clubs from making
announcements that might distract from the World Series and who is
likely to set an example by fining the Mets, even though they won't
officially announce Howe's hiring until Monday. The Mets blame Alan
Nero, the agent who represents Howe, Piniella and Macha, for being
the source of the leaks.</TE>
<TE>   The business of baseball is business, of course, and it's
difficult to control that or stop people from talking. It's doubtful,
for example, that Selig fined himself last year when it took him less
than 48 hours after the final out to distract from the memory of an
outstanding World Series with his announcement that two clubs would
be eliminated, a scenario doomed from the start.</TE>
<TE>   Are Howe and Piniella similarly doomed in their new environments?</TE>
<TE>   The Devil Rays have lost 206 games in the last two years, play in
baseball's worst ballpark and had the 28th lowest attendance in the
major leagues.</TE>
<TE>   All of that is similar to what Piniella inherited in Seattle,
where he helped bring down the Kingdome and save what is now one of
the most prosperous franchises.</TE>
<TE>   The difference is that he had Ken Griffey Jr., Randy Johnson and
Alex Rodriguez to work with, while Tampa Bay is still a team on the
come, still more suspect than prospect, an organization lacking a
clear-cut philosophy under LaMar and Naimoli while wasting millions
of dollars in an effort to appear presentable.</TE>
<TE>   Piniella won in Cincinnati and in Seattle, and Tampa Bay brings a
new challenge at a time when he might have gone stale in Seattle and
was angered by the refusal of Mariner ownership, despite cashing in
on the ATM that is Safeco Field, to provide the midseason help he
needed.</TE>
<TE>   The size of his contract and the willingness of the Devil Rays to
send All-Star center fielder Randy Winn to the Mariners as
compensation brings a new degree of credibility and commitment to an
organization in need of it, but it may take all of the four years --
or more -- for Piniella to produce a homecoming party.</TE>
<TE>   The Mets, meantime, are being blasted in the New York media for
failing to be more persuasive in the compensation talks with Seattle
(an industry source said they offered nothing comparable to Winn) for
the right to talk with Piniella and for failing to wait for Baker.</TE>
<TE>   The A's went to the playoffs each of the last three years under
Howe, but he never seemed to win General Manager Billy Beane's
endorsement. If that alone should have raised a red flag for the Mets
given Beane's evaluation skills, Howe's image (embellished certainly)
as nothing more than a laid-back stabilizer for the A's
self-motivated frat house seems at odds with the combustible Mets'
perceived need of an iron fist at the helm.</TE>
<TE>   Then again ...</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of the manipulative and media-conscious
Valentine, that quieter and calmer style might prove to be exactly
what the Mets need -- if, indeed, any manager can compensate for the
fallout of a fractious and frustrating summer and the signing
mistakes of last winter.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, well. If all managers weren't hired to be fired, the
merry-go-round wouldn't be spinning at its current speed.</TE>

<HD>Parry Ties Herron for Lead With 64</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Craig Parry shot an eight-under-par 64 Friday to tie Tim Herron for
the lead after two rounds at the Buick Challenge at Pine Mountain,
Ga.</LD>
<LD>   Parry, who won the NEC Invitational at Sahalee two months ago for
his first career PGA Tour victory in 235 starts, matched his lowest
round ever on tour. The Aussie is at 13-under 131 at Callaway
Gardens.</LD>
<LD>   Herron, who took the first-round lead with a 63, made five birdies
Friday and finished with a 68. Phil Mickelson shot a 67 and is one
stroke behind.</LD>
<TE>   Gray skies, a soggy golf course from a steady mist and soft greens
allowed players to take aim at the flags.</TE>
<TE>   More rain is expected over the weekend, so the starting times have
been moved up to 8 a.m. today, and 7 a.m. Sunday, when daylight
saving time begins.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Byrd had a 66 and was at 11-under 133, while the group at
134 included David Toms (68), Chris Riley (66) and J.L. Lewis (66).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hale Irwin moved a bit closer to senior tour history, shooting a
five-under 67 in his second round of the day to take the lead midway
through the rain-delayed Senior Tour Championship at Oklahoma City.</TE>
<TE>   Irwin, seeking to become the first senior golfer to win $3 million
in a season, has a two-round total of seven-under 137. That was one
shot better than defending champion Bob Gilder and Gil Morgan, and
two ahead of Larry Nelson.</TE>
<TE>   Irwin needs to finish fourth or better in this season-ending event
to eclipse $3 million.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Se Ri Pak had eight birdies in an opening seven-under 65 to take a
four-stroke lead in the Nine Bridges Classic at Jeju Island, South
Korea. Annika Sorenstam, Pak's playing partner, shot a 73.</TE>
<TE>   Cristie Kerr -- who used an eight-iron for a hole-in-one on the
160-yard No. 7 -- and Jackie Gallagher-Smith opened with 69s.</TE>

<TE>   Tennis</TE>
<TE>   Top-seeded Jennifer Capriati was stunned by unseeded Alexandra
Stevenson, 6-1, 6-1, in the quarterfinals of the Generali Open at
Linz, Austria.</TE>
<TE>   Stevenson's semifinal opponent will be fifth-seeded Daniela
Hantuchova, who beat ninth-seeded Anna Smashnova, 6-1, 4-6, 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   American Chanda Rubin beat third-seeded Jelena Dokic, 7-5, 6-2, to
advance to the semifinals. In another quarterfinal, fourth-seeded
Justine Henin beat eighth-seeded Silvia Farina-Elia, 7-6 (6), 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   Third-seeded Roger Federer of Switzerland beat No. 5 Andy Roddick
of the United States, 7-6 (5), 6-1, to advance to the semifinals of
the Swiss Indoors tournament at Basel. He will play David Nalbandian,
who knocked off top-seeded Tim Henman, 3-6, 7-6 (5), 6-2.... Chile's
Marcelos Rios advanced to the semifinals of the Stockholm Open by
defeating Swedish qualifier Andreas Vinciguerra, 6-3, 7-6 (3). Rios
will play Morocco's Hicham Arazi, a 7-5, 6-1 winner over Nicolas
Massu.... Slovakia's Karol Kucera overcame a slow start and beat
seventh-seeded Gaston Gaudio, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3, to advance to the
semifinals of the St. Petersburg Open in Russia.... Top-seeded Kim
Clijsters beat American Laura Granville, 6-0, 6-4, to advance to the
semifinals of the Seat Open at Luxembourg.</TE>

<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Five-time U.S. pairs champion Kyoko Ina has received a four-year
suspension from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency for refusal to take a
doping test July 18. That is the minimum sentence under International
Skating Union rules, which allow for a lifetime ban and a $1-million
fine in case of such refusal.</TE>
<TE>   Ina's attorney, Edward G. Williams, said Ina had not decided
whether to make a further appeal of the case based on procedural
improprieties. An appeal to the American Arbitration Assn. was
rejected 2-1 after an Oct. 11 hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Series leader Tony Stewart will start from the pole in the NAPA
500 on Sunday, because of a rainout of the first-ever night
qualifying for the Winston Cup race at Atlanta Motor Speedway in
Hampton, Ga.... Points leader Greg Biffle was awarded the pole for
today's race when rain washed away qualifying for the NASCAR Busch
Series Aaron's 312.</TE>
<TE>   Jockey Garrett Gomez, who has not ridden since Sunday, might not
be riding anytime soon.</TE>
<TE>   Gomez, 30, has been off his mounts for what stewards Ingrid
Fermin, Pete Pedersen and Tom Ward said are "personal reasons."
Pedersen said Gomez's agent isn't accepting mounts for the rider, who
had nine winners in 56 races at Oak Tree and whose mounts have earned
more than $4 million this year.</TE>
<TE>   America's Cup racing was called off for the second straight day
because of strong wind at Auckland, New Zealand. The wind today on
Hauraki Gulf averaged more than 19 knots, the maximum allowed.
Similar conditions are forecast for Sunday and Monday.</TE>

<HD>Saints Rebuild, Reap Reward</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ricky Williams? Gone. Pro Bowl tackle Willie Roaf? Gone.</LD>
<LD>   Pro Bowl defensive tackle La'Roi Glover, Pro Bowl defensive end
Joe Johnson, Pro Bowl linebacker Keith Mitchell? Gone, gone, gone.</LD>
<LD>   It isn't so astounding that the New Orleans Saints are 6-1. What's
astounding is how they got to be 6-1. After an epic collapse at the
end of last season, they got rid of several of their best players the
way someone would part out a totaled hot rod.</LD>
<TE>   "As players, we were thinking, 'What the heck is going on?' " said
center Jerry Fontenot, who has been with the Saints since 1997,
longer than anyone else on the roster. "It's not our job to make any
personnel decisions, but we just figured, well, they must have
something in mind."</TE>
<TE>   Turns out, they did. General Manager Randy Mueller, who himself
made it only until May, then was fired, and Coach Jim Haslett cleaned
house after an embarrassing finish to the 2001 season and did a
remarkable job rebuilding the team through free agency and the draft.</TE>
<TE>   The Saints traded Williams to Miami on draft day, promoting
second-year running back Deuce McAllister, even though he was largely
untested. They drafted scorching-fast receiver Donte Stallworth, who
scored touchdowns in his first four games before suffering a
hamstring injury. They moved Kyle Turley from right to left tackle
and gave him the responsibility of protecting the blind side of Aaron
Brooks. They signed defensive tackle Grady Jackson, who has
jaw-dropping quickness for a 330-pound man. They kept mercurial
receiver Michael Lewis, the former beer truck driver who two weeks
ago returned a punt and a kickoff for touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   But mostly, Haslett &amp; Co. built their team around players with
character, crucial for an organization that basically quit in the
last three games of last season -- losing to Tampa Bay, Washington
and San Francisco by a combined score of 136-21.</TE>
<TE>   "We had guys, in a way, that just quit on the team," McAllister
said. "We had guys that didn't want to be here, and our main focus
was to get the guys out of here who didn't want to be here.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we felt like we weren't headed in the right direction
as an organization and some changes had to be made."</TE>
<TE>   So far, following the blueprint has worked beautifully. Not only
have the Saints emerged as one of the best teams in the league, they
have beaten the Buccaneers, Redskins and 49ers, their three
tormentors at the end of last season.</TE>
<TE>   "That bitter taste hasn't left anyone's mouth," Fontenot said.
"Don't think for a second that that's not a motivating force. No one
wants to get back to that feeling we had."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Roski Ready and Willing</TE>
<TE>   In the effort to bring the NFL back to Los Angeles, no one has
invested more -- emotionally or financially -- than real estate
magnate Ed Roski, who spent millions to promote the Coliseum when
L.A. was outbid by Houston and was a principal in the South Park
coalition.</TE>
<TE>   All the setbacks haven't soured him on the goal.</TE>
<TE>   The man Forbes magazine lists as the 239th-richest American, with
an estimated net worth of $950 million, gets up early each Sunday
morning, goes for a run, then, like any regular Joe, plops in front
of the TV, grabs the remote and watches football all day.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to get back involved with anything that we could do to
bring an NFL team back to Los Angeles," Roski said this week. "It's a
complicated process in California, not just in L.A."</TE>
<TE>   Roski is quick to point out that L.A. isn't the only California
city that faces major hurdles in getting a football stadium built.
Just look at the state's three NFL franchises -- in San Diego, San
Francisco and Oakland -- each of which wants a new stadium or out of
its lease.</TE>
<TE>   Roski believes in an L.A. solution that's unpopular with many
league executives and team owners.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the Coliseum is an excellent option," he said. "I
wouldn't have spent my time and money there if I didn't. Although I
don't want to think about how much I spent on that now. One of those
bad dreams."</TE>
<TE>   Another South Park coalition member, Casey Wasserman, has made it
clear he has no interest in spending a dime to promote the Coliseum.
And, besides building a Carson sports complex that will serve as the
summer home of the San Diego Chargers, Denver billionaire Philip
Anschutz has no interest in stepping back into the NFL quicksand.</TE>
<TE>   But Roski is ready and willing to give it another go. He favors
the Coliseum, hasn't given much thought to the Rose Bowl, and is
always open to the thought of a third site -- as long as the city is
ready to make one concerted push behind a single project.</TE>
<TE>   "If I could figure a way to do it at my house, I'd do it at my
house," he said. "All of us really want to see a team back here. We
have some constraints we have to live with, but let's just do it.
Let's get going."</TE>

<TE>   Around the League</TE>
<TE>   AFC EAST -- Cris Carter might have been a prima donna in
Minnesota, but he passed his first personality test in Miami. Even
though he has worn No. 80 throughout his 15-year pro career, Carter
didn't press Dolphin receiver James McKnight to give up the number.
Instead, Carter will wear No. 88 when he makes his debut at Green Bay
in eight days.... New England, which has struggled gaining yards on
the ground, is facing Denver's top-ranked rushing defense Sunday.
Even after giving up 162 yards rushing in an overtime victory over
Kansas City last Sunday, the Broncos have given up an average of 75
yards rushing a game. Then again, that would be an improvement for
the Patriots, whose top back, Antowain Smith, is nickel-and-diming
teams to the tune of 62 yards a game.</TE>
<TE>   AFC NORTH -- Cleveland Coach Butch Davis has angered some of his
players and lots of Brown fans by repeatedly referring to the
franchise as an expansion team. What's worse, he suggested the Texans
are not an expansion team, because of the quality players that were
made available to Houston in the expansion draft. Regardless, the
excuse is wearing thin.... The Bengals won't be selling out
taxpayer-funded Paul Brown Stadium anytime soon, certainly not for
Sunday's game against Tennessee. The Bengals have played to full
houses seven times in 20 home games, and five of those were against
either Cleveland or Pittsburgh.... Raven Coach Brian Billick has been
pleading with Baltimore fans not to sell their tickets to Steeler
fans. He's sick of seeing all those swirling Terrible Towels at Raven
home games.</TE>
<TE>   AFC SOUTH -- Titan running back Eddie George has done some serious
damage to the Bengals over the years. He has seven touchdowns in his
last six games against Cincinnati, has rushed for a career-best 1,075
yards against the Bengals and has five 100-yard games against
them.... Tennessee's Kevin Carter is tied for the AFC lead with six
sacks, this after collecting only two last season. If he keeps up
this pace, he has a chance to match or break the Titan/Oiler sack
record set by Elvin Bethea in 1973 -- although it's unclear how
accurate that number is, considering an official tabulation of sacks
was not kept until years later.</TE>
<TE>   AFC WEST -- Even though he served only a one-week suspension for
his helmet-to-helmet hit on Miami receiver Chris Chambers, Denver
safety Kenoy Kennedy felt marooned. "I've just been chilling, kind of
like that Tom Hanks movie when he's stranded on an island with
Wilson," Kennedy told the Denver Post. "See me -- I haven't shaved,
haven't cut my hair, haven't done anything. Now I know what Tom Hanks
felt like." ... Kansas City's Dick Vermeil says he will not continue
coaching when his contract expires after the 2003 season.... So what
are they calling the oh-so-leaky Chief defense in Kansas City? The
"32" defense, of course, as in 32nd in the league.</TE>
<TE>   NFC EAST -- Dallas quarterback Chad Hutchinson will make his first
NFL start Sunday in place of benched Quincy Carter, who is none too
pleased about the demotion. Carter was told Hutchinson, a former pro
baseball player who has not taken a snap in a football game in five
years, would finish the season as the starter because the offense
will work better with him at the helm. "It's hard to entertain that
because two or three weeks ago I was delivering the football to nine
different receivers and hitting the right targets," said Carter, who
completed 13 of 22 for 202 yards with one touchdown and four
interceptions in a loss to Arizona last Sunday.... Former UCLA
receiver Freddie Mitchell, Philadelphia's first-round pick in the
2001 draft, has caught one pass for six yards this season. Nine
Eagles have caught more passes this season.... Steve Spurrier has
changed quarterbacks three times in four games. "I'm not fiddling,"
he said. "You give me an all-pro quarterback and I won't have to
fiddle around."</TE>
<TE>   NFC NORTH -- The renovations at Lambeau Field have created some
headaches for Packer opponents. The visitors' locker room, for
instance, is contained in two modular trailers. The bathroom and
shower facilities are cramped and spartan. "There was nothing NFL
about it," Atlanta cornerback Ray Buchanan complained to the
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. He compared the battleship-gray rooms to
something out of "The Shawshank Redemption." "Real cold -- like
Alcatraz," Buchanan said. "Looking like it was back in the day when
Lombardi was there. I might have seen his autograph in some
concrete." ... Who's the better rookie quarterback, David Carr or
Joey Harrington? Going by their passer ratings, the two are in a near
dead heat. Carr's is 66.9, Harrington's is 66.8.... Brian Urlacher
jerseys are the NFL's No. 1 sellers, and the Chicago linebacker is
one of the best players in the league. Why, then, are the Bears so
average when it comes to stopping the run? "It's not just Brian,"
defensive coordinator Greg Blache said. "This is not Gladys Knight
and the Pips, you know. This is everybody. We've got to be like the
Temptations; everybody is accountable. It's not like we have a star
and everybody else is just backup players and they go, 'doo-wop,
doo-wop.' "</TE>
<TE>   NFC SOUTH -- When the Falcons play the Saints, it will be the
first meeting of cousins as quarterbacks. Aaron Brooks and Michael
Vick, who grew up in Newport News, Va., and remain close friends.
Brooks, who is four years older than Vick, said about 25 relatives
would make the trip to New Orleans to catch the game. The Saints,
meanwhile, have had a tough time emulating Vick this week for their
No. 1 defense. "He's probably the best talent in the whole league,"
New Orleans Coach Haslett said. "He's probably one of the best
running backs in the league if you look at his numbers.... We could
give the ball to [running back] Michael Lewis and put it in his left
hand and have him run around, but I don't know how you [simulate
Vick]." ... Maybe the Saints should use the fan who eluded security
and darted into the 49er huddle last Sunday, looking to sign
someone's jersey. "I thought he was pretty fast," Haslett said. "I
think we ought to work him out."</TE>
<TE>   NFC WEST -- The 49ers are having a big problem stopping teams on
third down. In the last two games, opponents have converted on 20 of
29 third downs. For the season, opponents have converted 42 of 81
third downs (51.9%) -- the worst defensive performance in the league.
The 49er offense, though, has converted an NFL-best 52.8% (38 of
72).... More on that fan in the 49er huddle: It turned out to be Otis
Henry, 50, of New Roads, La., who was charged with disturbing the
peace. Conviction carries up to five months in jail, a $300 fine --
and, apparently, the undying admiration of some of the Saint players.
After 49er lineman Jeremy Newberry grabbed the man by the arm and
pushed him away, New Orleans defensive end Darren Howard charged into
the 49er huddle and warned, "Don't touch my fan." The general manager
of the Superdome told a Bay Area reporter the fan seemed to be
"highly intoxicated." Highly intoxicated? In New Orleans? Now that
would be a first.</TE>

<HD>Former Bruin Foster Out for the Season</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carolina Panther rookie running back DeShaun Foster, a former UCLA
standout, is out for the season because of a left knee injury and was
put on injured reserve Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Foster, who was the Panthers' second-round draft choice in April,
tore cartilage in his left knee in an exhibition game and has not
played.</LD>
<LD>   "DeShaun is obviously a guy that we thought would bring a
dimension to our offense that we were excited about," Coach John Fox
said. "When you find out that you are not going to have that
possibility for this season, it is disappointing."</LD>
<TE>   The Panthers also signed quarterback Tim Hasselbeck off their
practice squad and ruled Chris Weinke out for Sunday's game against
Tampa Bay because of a concussion.</TE>
<TE>   With Weinke out, rookie Randy Fasani of Stanford is expected to
start against the Buccaneers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta Falcon running back T.J. Duckett missed his third practice
in a row because of a sore foot, and it will be a game-time decision
whether he can play against New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Dan Reeves also said a decision on right tackle Todd Weiner
will be made a few hours before Sunday's game.</TE>
<TE>   Fullback Bob Christian practiced for the third consecutive day but
remains questionable with a concussion.</TE>
<TE>   Duckett, a first-round draft pick from Michigan State, is
questionable for the game. He scored the first touchdown of his
career in the second quarter last week, but the 254-pound Duckett
tore connective tissue in the arch of his left foot midway through
the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "It hurts, but I could play on it if I had to," Duckett said.
"We're just going to wait it out."</TE>
<TE>   Warrick Dunn will start in Duckett's place.</TE>
<TE>   The Falcons re-signed Maurice Smith, last year's leading rusher,
after third-stringer Travis Jervey went on injured reserve Tuesday
with a torn knee ligament.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore Raven linebacker Ray Lewis practiced for the first time
in three weeks, but his status for Sunday's game against Pittsburgh
remains questionable.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we're ahead of where we were last week," Coach Brian
Billick said. "Things are looking better. But it's going to be the
proverbial game-time decision."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis partially dislocated his left shoulder in the Ravens' 26-21
win at Cleveland on Oct. 6.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Miami Dolphin wide receiver Dedric Ward has been dismissed from a
lawsuit filed by a woman who claims he and three other NFL players
raped her in May 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Clark County District Judge Allan Earl ruled that Ward was not
served with the civil complaint in a timely fashion.</TE>
<TE>   The woman filed a lawsuit in December against Ward, Pittsburgh
Steeler quarterback Charlie Batch and former NFL players Ron Rice and
Tyree Talton.</TE>
<TE>   None of the players was charged with a crime.</TE>

<LD>SAM FARMER'S NFL RANKINGS AND COMMENTS:</LD>
<TE>*--*
Rank  Team (record)         Comment (last week's rank)
1     SAN DIEGO (6-1)       Open date comes at an ideal time for
                            Chargers' banged-up defense. (3)
2     NEW ORLEANS  (6-1)    Finally, Saints build a team with speed.
                            (5)
3     MIAMI  (5-2)          Cris Carter should help, but Dolphins
                            botched the Gadsden situation. (1)
4     OAKLAND (4-2)         Losing at home to San Diego could be a
                            big psychological blow. (2)
5     GREEN BAY  (6-1)      Packers lead the league with a plus-12
                            turnover differential. (7)
6     SAN FRANCISCO  (4-2)  At New Orleans, 49ers played well but
                            simply lost to a better team. (6)
7     PHILADELPHIA  (4-2)   Eagles have won seven prime-time games in
                            a row. (9)
8     TAMPA BAY  (5-2)      Rob Johnson finally gets his chance. (4)
9     DENVER  (5-2)         In their last meeting, Broncos
                            intercepted five Tom Brady passes. (8)
10    BUFFALO  (4-3)        Travis Henry is aiming for his fourth
                            consecutive 100-yard rushing game. (11)
11    KANSAS CITY  (3-4)    The last time against Raiders, Priest
                            Holmes had career-high 277 total yards.
                            (10)
12    PITTSBURGH  (3-3)     Steelers have beaten Baltimore five
                            consecutive times. (14)
13    ARIZONA  (4-2)        If the Cardinals win Sunday, they'll be
                            off to their best start since 1976. (16)
14    BALTIMORE  (3-3)      Ravens have won 18 of 23 games at home.
                            (18)
15    INDIANAPOLIS  (4-2)   Pass protection eroding: Manning has been
                            sacked seven times in two games. (12)
16    ATLANTA  (3-3)        Michael Vick has thrown 139 consecutive
                            passes without interception. (19)
17    NEW ENGLAND  (3-3)    Belichick took his team back to
                            training-camp basics last week. (17)
18    JACKSONVILLE  (3-3)   Jaguar special teams are the pits. (13)
19    CHICAGO  (2-4)        Bear intensity is seriously lacking. (15)
20    DALLAS  (3-4)         Emmitt gets his record, then Troy
                            Hambrick moves to the front of the line.
                            (20)
21    ST. LOUIS  (2-5)      Ram defense has given up one touchdown in
                            last two games. (24)
22    DETROIT  (2-4)        Lions have not won two games in a row
                            since the 2000 season. (26)
23    SEATTLE (1-5)         Good news for Emmitt: Seahawks have
                            league's worst rushing defense. (22)
24    TENNESSEE (2-4)       Should beat Cincinnati, but no team is
                            more unpredictable than the Titans. (23)
25    CLEVELAND (3-4)       Browns have next to no running game. (27)
26    CAROLINA (3-4)        Defense is the only thing keeping
                            Panthers in games. (21)
27    N.Y. GIANTS (3-3)     Michael Strahan always plays the Eagles
                            tough. (25)
28    N.Y. JETS  (2-4)      All-green uniforms worked for a week --
                            but everyone beats the Vikings. (31)
29    MINNESOTA  (1-5)      Viking turnover differential is
                            league-worst minus-14. (28)
30    WASHINGTON  (2-4)     QB-go-round continues. This week: Shane
                            Matthews. (29)
31    HOUSTON (1-5)         David Carr has shown poise, even though
                            he's taking a beating. (30)
32    CINCINNATI  (0-6)     Bengals have a decent chance to become
                            first 0-16 NFL team. (32)</TE>

<HD>Unbeaten Streak at 7 for Lightning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The undefeated Tampa Bay Lightning cleared another hurdle. It got a
rare victory over the Washington Capitals.</LD>
<LD>   Chris Dingman and Dave Andreychuk scored 51 seconds apart in the
first period, and the Lightning remained the NHL's only unbeaten team
with a 3-2 victory Friday night over the Capitals at Tampa, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   "It really doesn't mean anything because there's 82 games in the
season," Lightning center Vincent Lecavalier said. "Obviously it's
nice. I've never had that in my career. We've got to keep on going,
keep on building and get our confidence going even more."</LD>
<TE>   Nikolai Khabibulin faced 27 shots for the Lightning, which tied a
franchise record with a seven-game unbeaten streak (5-0-2). The
goalie stopped Jaromir Jagr on a first-period breakaway.</TE>
<TE>   "He had the puck and I tried to match his speed," Khabibulin said.
"He shot it, and it hit my pad."</TE>
<TE>   The Lightning ended a nine-game winless streak (0-8-1) -- dating
to a 5-2 win on Nov. 5, 2000 -- against Washington and won for only
the second time in the last 16 meetings (2-13-1).</TE>
<TE>   Dingman put the Lightning up, 1-0, at 10:29 of the first period.
It was his first goal in 65 games, dating back to Jan. 21.</TE>
<TE>   Andreychuk's goal during a five-on-three power play made it 2-0 at
11:20. Andreychuk has 248 power-play goals, one short of tying Phil
Esposito's NHL record.</TE>
<TE>   Fredrik Modin gave Tampa Bay a 3-0 lead only 1:21 into the second
period.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 7, Pittsburgh 3 -- Sergei Fedorov had a hat trick and Luc
Robitaille scored two goals at Detroit as the Red Wings ended the
Penguins' unbeaten streak at five.</TE>
<TE>   The Stanley Cup champions have not lost in four games since
dropping their home opener.</TE>
<TE>   Mario Lemieux, in his first game in Joe Louis Arena since Feb. 27,
1997, had two assists and now has an NHL-leading 16 points.</TE>
<TE>   Fedorov earned his fifth career hat trick -- all coming in the
second period.</TE>
<TE>   "He was awesome," Lemieux said of Fedorov. "The way he skates is
dominating, especially in the neutral zone. You can't defend that. He
took over the game."</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 2, Buffalo 1 -- Sergei Brylin scored the game winner
early in the third period, and Martin Brodeur made 23 saves for his
league-leading fifth victory as the Devils won at Buffalo, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Brodeur was at his best as the Sabres buzzed around the New Jersey
zone for much of the third period, including two key saves on Jochen
Hecht during a power play.</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo had just returned to full strength when Brylin put the
Devils ahead to stay only one minute into the final period.</TE>
<TE>   With Brodeur pulled for an extra attacker on a delayed Buffalo
penalty, New Jersey opened the scoring at 17:07. Ken Daneyko scored
his first goal in 256 games, ending the longest drought in NHL
history. He hadn't scored since February 1999.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose 5, Columbus 4 -- Vincent Damphousse had two goals --
including the game-winner with 5:45 left -- as the Sharks scored four
times in the final period to beat the Blue Jackets at Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose, which also got two goals from Teemu Selanne, rallied
from a two-goal deficit in the third period to win its second
straight game after winning only once in its first five.</TE>
<TE>   Columbus' Ray Whitney scored his first two goals of the season and
added an assist.</TE>

skirmish in final exhibition game.</DH>

<LD>Through a rivalry recently turned nasty, the Lakers and Sacramento
Kings hadn't actually hit each other in the mouth, but now that last
bit of decorum is gone too.</LD>
<LD>   Two minutes and seven seconds into Friday night's exhibition game
at Staples Center, Rick Fox fought King guard Doug Christie twice,
once on the floor and again in a tunnel leading to the Kings' locker
room. The second drew most of the Kings from their bench, along with
Laker center Shaquille O'Neal, though apparently no one was injured.</LD>
<LD>   "It makes it personal," Kobe Bryant said.</LD>
<TE>   With opening night Tuesday, Fox and Christie face almost certain
fines and suspensions by the league office. Denver's Juwan Howard,
who threw two punches in an exhibition game this week, was suspended
two games and fined $15,000, and O'Neal missed Brad Miller with a
punch last season and was suspended three games.</TE>
<TE>   Playing against the backdrop of last spring's Western Conference
finals, won by the Lakers in a searing, emotional seven games, and a
summer spent insulting each other's franchises, the Lakers and Kings
-- "Queens," according to O'Neal -- met in the final preseason game
for both, the Kings winning, 93-88.</TE>
<TE>   An hour before, O'Neal had said the talk was simply that, a way to
market the league and a rivalry that had grown taut through each of
the past three postseasons, all ending for the Kings with losses to
the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of five months of trash talking, there were two minutes
of basketball, followed by Fox grabbing the basketball on the left
wing, Christie apparently too close. Fox, feisty in the most common
circumstances, swung an elbow that clipped Christie near the face,
and Christie fell to the floor with some exaggeration.</TE>
<TE>   Fox, called for an offensive foul, let the ball fall, and Christie
flipped it back at him, into his face. With an open hand, Fox pushed
Christie in the face, and then Christie hit Fox in the chin with a
short left.</TE>
<TE>   "As a man, you have to be able to say that I am not going to take
that from nobody," King guard Bobby Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   As the crowd gasped, referees and players from both sides stepped
between the fighting players -- too late in Laker Coach Phil
Jackson's opinion -- and that appeared to end it. The three officials
huddled and shortly thereafter it was announced that Fox and Christie
had been ejected.</TE>
<TE>   Fox then darted from the Laker bench, through the tunnel, down a
hallway that separates the locker rooms and to the mouth of the
Kings' tunnel, where he met Christie coming off the floor.</TE>
<TE>   "He threw the ball in Rick's face," Laker forward Samaki Walker
said. "Like any man in this league, you're not going to let a man hit
you in the face."</TE>
<TE>   According to witnesses, Fox put a headlock around Christie, who
threw several more punches at Fox, some of which Fox returned. The
two grappled there until they were engulfed by Kings rushing from
their bench and arena security personnel, then fell into a black
curtain.</TE>
<TE>   "Crazy people. Stupid people. Seriously," King center Vlade Divac
said. "Rick is the guy who did something. But Doug also crossed the
line."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if Fox went too far by racing to confront Christie, Divac
raised his eyebrows and said, "He went way too far. He went overseas
and came back, if you talk about distance."</TE>
<TE>   Fox left the building without comment. Only Jackson blamed the
officials.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone should have stepped in immediately," Jackson said. "I
don't think Rick was at fault at all, trying to hold him off, putting
his hand up."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson suggested the Kings should bear repercussions for leaving
their bench en masse, while he tried to hold back his players.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a lot of sorting it out," he said. "I know my
players felt extremely uncomfortable with knowing Rick was by himself
with the entire other team in the runway."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, who chased Fox from the floor and into the sea of Kings,
was seen protecting Fox in the tunnel, his plaid outfit unmistakable
in the melee. A witness said O'Neal was there as peacekeeper, and
that at one point he shoved Divac, a moment Divac affably called "a
misunderstanding."</TE>
<TE>   "I just had to make sure [stuff] was right," O'Neal said.</TE>
<TE>   So the Lakers, already short O'Neal to start the season, likely
also will be without Fox. And while Fox appeared to instigate the
fights, it was Christie who threw and landed the only closed-fisted
punch.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers and Kings don't play in the regular season until
Christmas Day.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bryant had 23 points and 12 assists against the Kings.... Guard
Jannero Pargo, an undrafted free agent from Arkansas, has made the
team, Jackson said. Mark Madsen, who has a strained hamstring, could
start the season on the injured list.</TE>

<HD>Anglers Reeling Over Restrictions</HD>

<LD>The recent gloomy weather so prevalent along the waterfront may be
unseasonal, but perhaps that's fitting because the same adjective
could be used to describe the mood.</LD>
<LD>   "California anglers have just been knocked flat by the train
leaving the station," said Tom Raftican, president of the United
Anglers of Southern California. "Other states need to take notice,
because they're next."</LD>
<LD>   Though most skippers and landing operators knew it was coming,
Wednesday's announcement that much of the Channel Islands will be
permanently off-limits to fishing, beginning Jan. 1, hit anglers like
a freight train.</LD>
<TE>   The ban, announced by the California Fish and Game Commission at a
meeting in Santa Barbara, encompasses 175 square miles and includes a
network of 13 strategically placed marine reserves and marine
conservation areas along portions of each of the five northern
Channel Islands.</TE>
<TE>   The establishment of no-fishing reserves, rather than the
management of fisheries through catch and size limits, does appear to
be the wave of the future. More are proposed along the California
coast, and similar movements are underway in other states.</TE>
<TE>   In California, they're designed largely to protect overfished
species of rockfish, most notably bocaccio, and other bottom fishes.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists applauded the 2-1 vote of the commissioners
approving one of the largest marine reserves in the United States but
anglers -- they viewed the attendance of only three of five
commissioners as a slap in the face -- voiced the same complaints
they've had all along: The science used to assess the fisheries is
flawed; commercial fishing, not sportfishing, is responsible for any
such depletions; nobody has adequately taken into consideration the
economic impact such closures will have.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only will thousands of people in the region no longer be able
to pursue America's most popular outdoor leisure-time sport, but the
local charter boats, hotels, restaurants and other business that rely
on angler dollars will suffer," Mike Nussman, president of the
American Sportfishing Assn., said in a news release Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   All of these claims have been argued to the contrary by scientists
and working groups that have drawn up the proposals, and by
environmental advocates during a lengthy public review process.</TE>
<TE>   As the leaders of sportfishing groups continue to lash out at
those in support of such exclusionary measures, and Gov. Gray Davis
and the commissioners he appointed are their most visible targets,
captains and landing operators are left with little choice but to try
to adapt.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, about 80% of where we have traditionally fished is
affected by the closures so we'll have to find new spots," said Bruce
Williams, manager of Port Hueneme Sportfishing. "The sad part is that
we generally fish most of those areas for migratory fish such as
yellowtail and white seabass. It's not like we're sitting there all
day pounding the rockfish."</TE>
<TE>   Though large areas of island and coastal waters will remain open
to fishing for years to come, many landing operators have begun to
explore their options.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to have to adapt," Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The saltwater angling community has cast its support almost
entirely behind Bill Simon for governor.</TE>
<TE>   And the Republican hopeful is doing what he can to foster the
disdain many of the state's 2 million licensed anglers hold toward
Davis, who has been accused of catering to environmental interests
for political reasons.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to the editor of a weekly Southland fishing
publication -- now circulating on the Internet -- Simon promised to
"commit to all of those anglers that I will make appointments of
individuals to my administration who understand the importance of
recreational fishing to the state's economy, and who understand the
importance of sound fisheries management, using" all the tools
available to them.</TE>
<TE>   "First and foremost," Simon's letter stated, "I will demand that
any management decisions be based on good science, not on
protectionist rhetoric."</TE>

<LD>With only nine innings standing between them and winter, the Angels'
mantra today is clear: Desperate times require desperate measures.</LD>
<LD>   If writing a World Series prediction column from a couch in a
bathrobe isn't desperate, I don't know what is.</LD>
<LD>   Game 6, Pregame:</LD>
<TE>   Having long since run out of former stars to throw out the first
pitch, the Angels ask Kevin Appier to show up early.</TE>
<TE>   A member of the color guard singles up the middle.</TE>
<TE>   An emaciated, long-haired national anthem singer on a smoke break
from his job across the street as "Snow White" doubles down the line.</TE>
<TE>   An overeager pilot ejects and parachutes down during the fly-over,
then grabs a bat and clubs a three-run homer.</TE>
<TE>   Game 6, Third Inning:</TE>
<TE>   With Appier having settled down and held the Giants scoreless
despite throwing 164 pitches, the umpires run out of balls.</TE>
<TE>   A new batch is delivered to home plate by an acne-speckled guy
squeezed into a Gold's Gym polo shirt.</TE>
<TE>   He winks at Bud Selig. He smiles at Barry Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   He glares at the Angels, who become so enraged they erupt for 6
1/2 runs.</TE>
<TE>   It would have been seven, but just before Orlando Palmeiro knocks
a ball 480 feet for a homer, frisky Al Levine cuts the thing in half.</TE>
<TE>   Game 6, Fifth Inning:</TE>
<TE>   On his 258th pitch, the clock approaching midnight, Appier finally
allows a run on a base-loaded intentional walk to Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Having been cornered in a nearby hospital before the game by some
whiny, bothersome, sick child begging for a home run, Bonds thanks
Appier for letting him off the hook.</TE>
<TE>   Game 6, Seventh Inning:</TE>
<TE>   The Giants take the lead by scoring six runs in a span of six
minutes. The Angel defense is rendered helpless when Dusty Baker's 3
1/2-year-old son Darren sits on the middle of home plate with a
cheese sandwich and a juice box.</TE>
<TE>   Game 6, Eighth Inning:</TE>
<TE>   The Angels counter with a touchdown. The Giants come back with two
field goals.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels score a hat trick. The Giants retaliate with a
triple-double.</TE>
<TE>   "This ain't baseball," says the Gold's Gym guy.</TE>
<TE>   "And still nobody's watching it," sighs his new buddy, the Ginsu
guy.</TE>
<TE>   Game 6, Ninth Inning:</TE>
<TE>   David Eckstein hits an apparent game-winning home run that lands
just outside the Pond, where it is immediately picked up and traded
to San Jose for some guys we've never heard of.</TE>
<TE>   Final score: Angels 125, Giants 124 in double overtime.</TE>
<TE>   "NOW who has the bad haircut?" Eckstein screams at the Giant
dugout as he rounds third base and bowls over cute little
S'more-stained Darren.</TE>
<TE>   Game 7, Pregame:</TE>
<TE>   The Angels show up for this ultimate clash wearing baggy pants
adorned with little fire engines and dump trucks.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, if Bonds can play in pajama bottoms, so can we," they claim.</TE>
<TE>   Game 7, Third Inning:</TE>
<TE>   The game, a scoreless tie, is delayed several minutes while
baseball celebrates the winner of the American Express Most Memorable
Moments Contest.</TE>
<TE>   First prize goes to a guy whose delinquent card was cut in half by
the maitre'd while he attempted to buy dinner at his 25th class
reunion.</TE>
<TE>   Game 7, Fourth Inning:</TE>
<TE>   The Giants score first, tallying two runs after little Darren
invites two preschool buddies to home plate for a sleepover.</TE>
<TE>   Game 7, Fifth Inning:</TE>
<TE>   Dusty Baker removes the visible end of his toothpick to reveal
that, for an entire season, he has actually been chewing on the tiny
ceramic head of Tommy Lasorda.</TE>
<TE>   Game 7, Sixth Inning:</TE>
<TE>   Fox reports that, according to an investigation by a sideline
reporter who became bored upon discovering that baseball has no
sidelines, Darren Baker is really not Dusty Baker's son.</TE>
<TE>   He is actually Benito Santiago's great-great-great grandson.</TE>
<TE>   Game 7, Seventh Inning:</TE>
<TE>   Bonds gives the Giants a one-run lead with a home run during which
he spends 20 minutes walking around the bases.</TE>
<TE>   Garret Anderson responds with an RBI single that takes just as
long.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, that same bored sideline reporter reveals that Kenny
Lofton's Game 4 bunt didn't naturally roll fair, it was blown fair by
a large-lunged man sitting in the front row along the third-base
line.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say the culprit, disguised as a sports executive,
acknowledged his name was Tony Tavares.</TE>
<TE>   Game 7, Eighth Inning:</TE>
<TE>   Tim Salmon gives the Angels the lead with a home run on a Felix
Rodriguez slider that he obviously knew was coming.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw it all the way," Salmon says later, before quickly changing
the subject.</TE>
<TE>   Photographs later reveal that during the winning at-bat, a man
identified as Robert Daly was sitting in the left-field bleachers
holding binoculars and giant sign reading "Slider."</TE>
<TE>   Game 7, Ninth Inning:</TE>
<TE>   The Angels protect their 110-109 victory with two out in the top
of the inning when, while rounding third with the tying run, Jeff
Kent runs smack into a For Sale sign that has been hastily stuck into
the ground by an anxious Michael Eisner.</TE>
<TE>   Says Eisner: "I'm so proud of what's-their-names."</TE>
<TE>   Parade Tuesday. Brokers Open to follow.</TE>

<LD>Angel Manager Mike Scioscia has said it all year.</LD>
<LD>   He said it after the Angels had started the season 6-14, worse
than any other Angel team -- good, bad, pitifully bad -- in history.
The Angels are good, Scioscia would say. The Angels were going to
play better, Scioscia would say.And most of Southern California would
laugh and go back to the NBA playoffs and celebrating the Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   Then the Angels had an eight-game winning streak, went 19-7 in
May, had a stretch of games at the end of April and May when they won
17 of 20, then 21 of 24. Not that Southern California noticed. Most
of the games weren't televised. Many were farmed out to various
low-wattage radio stations while the Lakers took precedence.</LD>
<TE>   Scioscia would gently point out that, see, the Angels were good,
just as he'd said.</TE>
<TE>   But too many Southern Californians sniffed knowingly, looked over
the schedule, noticed that the Angels were mainly winning games
against inferior teams and suggested that Scioscia just wait, that he
might be a fine manager, but sometime soon the Angels were going to
be playing the good teams. Teams such as the Dodgers and Cardinals in
interleague play.</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, the Angels lost four in a row to the Dodgers and
Cardinals and too many Southern Californians thought they were right.
See, the Angels were folding as usual and big deal, they were 51-35
at the All-Star break but look out. Coming up was a stretch of 20
games against Minnesota, Oakland, Seattle, Boston, New York. Real
teams.</TE>
<TE>   When the Angels blew a 7-1 lead and lost to the Twins, 10-8, to
start that stretch, too many Southern Californians acted as if they
understood the Angels and predicted doom. Closer Troy Percival was
injured after all, and the tough stuff was only beginning.</TE>
<TE>   But ace Jarrod Washburn went six the next night, gave up only two
runs and Scot Shields and Ben Weber combined for three scoreless
innings and the Angels won, 4-2. They went 12-8 in those 20 games.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California wasn't convinced. When the Angels blew a 9-5
lead in the bottom of the ninth against the Red Sox in late August,
when Percival gave up the tying runs and Shields handed Johnny Damon
a home run pitch in the bottom of the 10th and Boston won, 10-9, and
celebrated as if it had won the pennant, a lot of us thought the
Angels were done, finally. This was it. The killer blow.</TE>
<TE>   So the Angels won 11 of their next 12, 17 of their next 19 and
pretty much wrapped up a playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   It might be worth mentioning how the Angels were losing to the
Yankees, 6-1, after 2 1/2 innings in Game 3 of the American League
division playoffs and if you were one of the Southern Californians
who turned off the TV and smugly said, "Nice job, Rally Boys, and now
the season's over," you weren't alone.</TE>
<TE>   We mention all this because it seems Southern California has given
up on the Angels again.</TE>
<TE>   The pitchers have hit the wall. Troy Glaus blew the World Series
by choosing wrong on foul-not foul in Game 4. Garret Anderson is a
bum for not catching that foul ball in Game 5 because if he had, the
whole course of a 16-4 thrashing would have been changed. Kevin
Appier can't get anybody out. And even if he does in Game 6, Ramon
Ortiz is hurting too much to get through Game 7.</TE>
<TE>   All over the Southland, the Angels are hearing themselves
congratulated for a fine season, being thanked for the thrills and
being told that World Series loser is pretty darn good.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard not to feel that way. It's hard to imagine the Angels
winning two more games. It's hard not to picture Barry Bonds hitting
a couple of more home runs, getting three or four more rally-starting
walks. It's hard not to figure that Jeff Kent found his stroke and
confidence for the duration and that Kenny Lofton and Rich Aurilia
and Benito Santiago won't keep stroking those line drives.</TE>
<TE>   "I think," Scioscia said, "anyone writing us off in this series is
a little premature."</TE>
<TE>   Did you hear that? It's barely audible amid the cacophony of
doomsday talk.</TE>
<TE>   Do you believe it? The doubters haven't believed Scioscia yet.</TE>
<TE>   "Guys aren't going to be moping around," Tim Salmon said.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon was one of a couple of Angels at Edison Field on Friday. He
was receiving treatment for a tired body and maybe a tired soul.</TE>
<TE>   "At this stage," he said, "everybody's exhausted."</TE>
<TE>   But he also said, "Our backs are against the wall. We're going to
come out fighting. We've been in this situation all year long. We're
actually more familiar being in this position, where we're kind of
the underdog. I think we're going to come out, play our game, be
tough and gritty and fight."</TE>
<TE>   Fighting is good. Fighting with weapons is better.</TE>
<TE>   And for two more days, the Angels need all their weapons.</TE>
<TE>   All season, the Angels have won because everybody knew his job and
performed that job. There is no room for a passed ball, Bengie
Molina, or a wrong guess on a foul or fair bunt, Troy Glaus. There is
no time for a bad at-bat, Garret Anderson or Tim Salmon. This is not
the moment for messed-up mechanics or over-thinking, Kevin Appier.
There is no place now for Ben Weber and his gasless stamina, so
Francisco Rodriguez and Scott Schoeneweis and Brendan Donnelly need
to be perfect, and Percival may need to pitch longer than he likes.</TE>
<TE>   This seems too much to ask. But the Angels have been giving us
more than we've expected all year, whether they were expected to or
not.</TE>

<HD>Ortiz in Bullpen, With Lackey Held Back for Game 7</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ramon Ortiz, who has not made a relief appearance since he pitched
rookie ball in 1996, will be in the Angel bullpen for Game 6 of the
World Series today. John Lackey, with two relief appearances during
postseason play, will be held back for a possible Game 7 start
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "We had to hold someone back," Manager Mike Scioscia said.</LD>
<LD>   Although that decision strongly indicates that Lackey is the
Angels' choice to start Game 7, on three days' rest, Scioscia said he
would not rule out starting Ortiz, if he were not needed today in
relief of Kevin Appier. Scioscia said that he preferred not to use
Lackey in relief today, three days after he threw 95 pitches in his
Game 4 start.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia said that closer Troy Percival, who has worked once in
the past 12 days, would be available in the eighth inning today. But
Scioscia did not think much of the idea of using Percival, usually
limited to the ninth inning, in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's unrealistic to look at him to come in and throw 2
2/3 innings," Scioscia said. "I hope it wouldn't come down to that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have not had a home game rained out in seven years, so
the tarp rarely is used. When showers hit Anaheim on Friday, the
Edison Field grounds crew scurried to unroll the tarp -- and out
rolled a possum, very much alive.</TE>
<TE>   "It scared the living daylights out of me," said crew member Mike
Clark of Seal Beach. "But, when you haven't pulled the tarp out since
April, you know something's probably living in there."</TE>
<TE>   After the obligatory jokes about whether the grounds crew should
adopt the animal as a rally possum, the crew members released the
possum into the Santa Ana River bed. Possums and raccoons are no
strangers to the stadium grounds, field manager Barney Lopas said.</TE>
<TE>   The rain is forecast to continue this morning but stop well in
advance of tonight's first pitch.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While Dusty Baker's future as the Giants' manager has been the
subject of endless speculation, volumes of newspaper copy and hours
of radio and television air time this month, it has not caused Baker,
whose contract expires after the World Series, an ounce of worry all
season.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not really concerned about my future because I've always been
taken care of in some kind of way," Baker said Friday. "I have faith
in God, faith in the fact that I will be taken care of."</TE>
<TE>   His battle against prostate cancer last year, Baker said, gave him
a perspective he might not have had otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just living," Baker said. "I'll tell you one time here: I
have so much insight and so much spiritual enlightenment and faith
now, especially after having cancer last year. I see my son, I see my
wife, I see a lot of things to live for. Why am I going to worry
about little stuff like this?</TE>
<TE>   "If I hadn't gone to the doctor when I went to the doctor, I could
have been dead right now. Really, I'm worrying about the wrong thing
if you want me to worry about what you asked me to worry about."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baker said Shawon Dunston would start at designated hitter against
Appier tonight. Dunston had a single in three at-bats in Game 2,
which Appier started, but his hit came off reliever Ben Weber....
Barry Bonds has reached base in 16 of 23 plate appearances in the
Series, with six hits, 10 walks and a .696 on-base percentage....
Giant shortstop Rich Aurilia has 17 runs batted in this postseason,
two shy of the major league record set by Cleveland's Sandy Alomar
Jr. in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   As might be expected, the Los Angeles television rating for the
Angels' 16-4 loss to San Francisco in Game 5 was the lowest of the
Series, a 26.3.</TE>
<TE>   The game drew a 34.8 in San Francisco and a 26.0 in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   The national Nielsen rating was a 10.0 with a 17 share of the
audience.</TE>
<TE>   That's 31% lower than the 14.4/24 for Game 5 last year, when the
New York Yankees defeated Arizona, 3-2, in 12 innings.</TE>

<KH>SKATE AMERICA</KH>
<HD>Kwan Surprising; Yagudin Hurting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Philip Hersh</AU>
<BD>Chicago Tribune</BD>
<DL>SPOKANE, Wash</DL>
<LD>SPOKANE, Wash. -- With few things left to prove in her figure skating
career, Michelle Kwan might inadvertently disprove an axiom about
athletes and entertainers.</LD>
<LD>   That old practice-makes-perfect idea seems overrated after what
Kwan did late Thursday night at Skate America, in which she decided
to compete only a week ago.</LD>
<LD>   She threw together an Olympic-style short program in less than two
weeks, skated it publicly for the first time in this opening event of
the Grand Prix series and delivered a performance that was
world-class by whatever judging system measures it. If she can match
that skating level today with a relatively well-rehearsed long
program -- it is six weeks old -- Kwan will show again she can be the
class of the world.</LD>
<TE>   After winning the men's short program Friday night, Olympic
champion Alexei Yagudin of Russia said the pain in his right hip has
returned with such intensity that his future as a competitive skater
is imperiled. Yagudin said a doctor who gave him an anti-inflammatory
injection here Thursday told him the hip problem was congenital and
would probably worsen quicker if he continued to compete.</TE>
<TE>   The four-time world champion became tearful when asked if next
week's Skate Canada might be his final competition. "I really have to
think what's the best thing for me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kwan has yet to commit to any other competitions after this
weekend, but she hinted strongly about going for a seventh national
title in January and fifth world title in March.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so nice to surprise everyone," Kwan said.</TE>
<TE>   She was referring to her decision to compete here after Olympic
gold medalist Sarah Hughes pulled out because of a leg injury. That
feeling also could be applied to the quality of her performance and
the compelling nature of her program.</TE>
<TE>   Her music was Peter Gabriel's "The Feeling Begins," which uses an
Armenian melody and Near Eastern instrumental tonalties. Those sounds
allowed Kwan, a collaborator in the choreography, to incorporate some
of the best hand, head and arm movements from similar programs she
has done.</TE>
<TE>   The 10 judges gave her marks of mainly 5.7 for technical merit and
mainly 5.8 for presentation. The interim scoring system in force this
year counted only seven of the 10 judges' marks, selected randomly
and secretly, but each of Kwan's marks was higher than all but two
rivals.</TE>
<TE>   No matter what judging system is in place, reputation still
scores. That is how Yagudin earned a 4-3 edge over France's
18-year-old Brian Joubert for first place in Friday's short program,
despite Joubert's superior skating.</TE>

<HD>Ferguson Is the King of the Cups</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What do soccer, golf and horse racing have in common? More to the
point, what links the European Cup, the Ryder Cup and today's
Breeders' Cup?</LD>
<LD>   The answer, surprisingly enough, is Manchester United Coach Alex
Ferguson.</LD>
<LD>   The 60-year-old Scot won the European Cup in 1999; he has a
longtime friend, Scottish golfer Sam Torrance, who last month won the
Ryder Cup, and today Ferguson has a horse, Rock of Gibraltar, who is
the even-money favorite to win the Mile in the Breeders' Cup.</LD>
<TE>   In June of 2001, Ferguson bought a 50% share of the Irish-bred
colt for just under $200,000. Since then, the 3-year-old, trained by
Aidan O'Brien, has won seven consecutive Grade I races in Europe,
breaking a 30-year-old record set by the great Mill Reef.</TE>
<TE>   Today's Mile at Arlington Park will be Rock of Gibraltar's final
race before retiring to stud. Ferguson has enjoyed -- not to mention
profited from -- the ride. The colt is estimated to be worth $50
million in stud fees.</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult to compare [horse racing] with football," Ferguson
said earlier this year. "I give the orders [at Manchester United],
whereas in racing I leave everything to Aidan."</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson doesn't mind being a spectator, though, as he showed when
Torrance led Europe to victory over the United States in the Ryder
Cup last month.</TE>
<TE>   "It was fantastic," Ferguson said at the time. "I don't think I've
ever been gripped in a sport other than football in the way I was. It
was incredible. At times it was almost perfection.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really delighted for Sam. I've known him since he was a lad.
That was a long time ago. He showed he was never in a panic. He was
in control, and it's good to see someone in control."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Good Week</TE>
<TE>   It has been a good week for Wayne Rooney. Last Saturday, he scored
a superb goal for Everton to defeat English champion Arsenal and end
its seven-month, 30-game unbeaten streak in the Premier League.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the pleasing news that his agents had reached
agreement with Everton on a contract worth nearly $750,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   And, oh yes, there was his birthday. On Thursday, Wayne Rooney
turned 17.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Bad Week</TE>
<TE>   It has been a bad week for aging Mexican dentist Hugo Sanchez. On
Tuesday, Sanchez, coach of UNAM in Mexico, was incensed after the
Pumas were beaten, 1-0, by unheralded Estudiantes de Merida in
Venezuela in a Copa Libertadores qualifying game.</TE>
<TE>   "They had warned me about the refereeing in the Libertadores, but
I didn't think it was as bad as this," Sanchez fumed.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Sanchez received more bad news when his bitter
rival, Argentine-born Ricardo Lavolpe, was named Mexico's national
coach, a job Sanchez had sought. Starting when they were players, the
two have feuded for years.</TE>
<TE>   It remains to be seen whether Lavolpe will further torment Sanchez
by either ignoring UNAM players or by calling them into the national
team at inconvenient times.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, it might be enough to make Sanchez wonder why he chose
coaching instead of putting his dentistry degree to use.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Foreign Flavor</TE>
<TE>   The goal scored by Carlos Ruiz on Sunday against the New England
Revolution not only gave the Galaxy its first Major League Soccer
championship but kept alive an odd streak.</TE>
<TE>   Americans Eddie Pope and Tony Sanneh scored the game-winning goals
in the first two MLS Cups in 1996 and 1997, but the winner has been
scored by a foreign player for the last five seasons.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998 it was Poland's Jerzy Podbrozny; in 1999 it was Bolivia's
Jaime Moreno; in 2000 it was Denmark's Miklos Molnar; in 2001 it was
Canada's Dwayne DeRosario, and in 2002 it was Guatemala's Ruiz. It
doesn't mean much, but it is a peculiar statistic.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Say What?</TE>
<TE>   It looks as if Claudio Reyna, the U.S. team captain, is in for an
eye-opening time now that his English Premier League club,
Sunderland, has hired Howard Wilkinson as coach.</TE>
<TE>   England's Guardian newspaper reports that when Wilkinson, 58, was
asked his heroes, he rattled off five of them: "[jockey] Lester
Piggott, Frank Sinatra, Fidel Castro has done a magnificent job in
some respects, the fellow who invented red wine, and the outside
right I used to have at Boston United [an amateur team he coached
three decades ago]."</TE>
<TE>   Here's another bit on Wilkinson wisdom: "If you make it a game of
life or death, you'll be dead a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Reyna surely never heard anything like that from U.S. Coach Bruce
Arena.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How Great I Am</TE>
<TE>   Roberto Carlos believes there is only one player who deserves to
be chosen FIFA world player of the year for 2002: Roberto Carlos.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the only player in the world who won everything in 48 days,"
the Real Madrid left back told the Spanish sports daily AS. "If they
don't want to give me an award, then fine, but my titles are there
for all to see. My rivals all had one bad competition. It's been my
year."</TE>
<TE>   Roberto Carlos won the European Champions Cup with Real Madrid in
May and the World Cup with Brazil in June.</TE>
<TE>   The award for modesty has yet to be presented.</TE>

<HD>UCLA Is Headed Back to Finishing School</HD>
<DH>Today's game against Stanford crucial for team seeking to
avoid another late-season collapse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This baker's dozen has been popped straight into the oven.</LD>
<LD>   The 13 uninjured UCLA seniors are feeling the heat, feverishly
working to make their final season something more than a total
disaster.</LD>
<LD>   Dreams they had as freshmen of winning a Pacific 10 Conference
championship and appearing in a top-tier bowl game have gone
unfulfilled. And they've always finished poorly, having lost four of
the last five games in 1999, the last three in 2000 and four of the
last five in 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Beginning with today's home game against struggling Stanford, the
seniors are struggling to end their careers with a semblance of
accomplishment and pride.</TE>
<TE>   "We've kept our spirits high," senior linebacker Marcus Reese
said. "We've got to keep on battling and fighting. We can't have any
quitters."</TE>
<TE>   The veterans still wince at the memories of last season's free
fall. A larger, more touted senior group lost its focus after its
first loss. Players ducked into bathrooms to take cell phone calls
minutes before games and talk turned to NFL aspirations.</TE>
<TE>   Team goals were simplified this year. Lofty ambitions were
replaced by the simpler goal of focusing on the next game.</TE>
<TE>   After Pac-10 losses to Oregon and California by dishearteningly
close scores the last two weeks dropped the Bruins to 4-3 and 1-2,
the logic seems inescapable.</TE>
<TE>   "We took care of it before the season even started," senior
cornerback Ricky Manning said. "The upcoming game is all I care
about. There won't be any Rose Bowl or Pac-10 championship, but what
are you going to do?</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to remember why we are here -- to have fun and play the
games."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Bob Toledo met with the seniors this week, urging them to
remain positive and give their all down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "I need them to be supportive. I need them to hang in there. I
need them to battle," he said. "They're great kids, and they're not
selfish."</TE>
<TE>   The response was encouraging.</TE>
<TE>   "If you dwell on missed opportunities, or the injuries, you go
crazy," senior tight end Mike Seidman said. "We've got five more
games, plus a possible bowl game. We worked the entire spring and
summer for these few Saturdays. We've got to make each one count."</TE>
<TE>   Younger players will follow the seniors' lead. Reese heard some
grumbling. Playing time was being questioned. Coaching decisions were
being second-guessed. He told the whiners to knock it off.</TE>
<TE>   "It's natural to do that, but we can't complain about negative
things," he said. "I see people complaining, especially young ones.
I'm just going to do all I can to win the game. I have to trust the
coaches."</TE>
<TE>   Senior quarterback Cory Paus is sidelined -- probably for the rest
of the season -- because of a broken leg bone. His backup, freshman
Drew Olson, is questionable because of a slightly separated shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Matt Moore makes his debut today. But he is only one of
several freshmen in key positions, frustrating for seniors who don't
have time to wait for potential to develop.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman tailback Tyler Ebell has come along quicker than anyone
imagined and has racked up three consecutive 100-yard rushing
performances. Freshman fullbacks Keith Carter -- a converted tight
end -- and J.D. Groves are strong and tough but often make mistakes
out of exuberance and inexperience.</TE>
<TE>   Center Mike McCloskey also is a freshman, causing Toledo to joke
that "baseball teams are supposed to be strong up the middle. Well,
we're young up the middle."</TE>
<TE>   On defense, safety Jarrad Page and outside linebacker Spencer
Havner are freshmen. Both are athletic and mobile enough to make big
plays, yet they are occasionally caught out of position.</TE>
<TE>   Experience is something the seniors don't lack. They've had their
share of hard knocks too. Breaks have not been kind to a group that
might be remembered as the Unlucky 13. Besides Reese, Manning and
Seidman, it includes tackles Mike Saffer and Bryce Bohlander, kickers
Nate Fikse and Chris Griffith, defensive linemen Sean Phillips, Steve
Morgan and Rusty Williams, and reserves Joe Hunter, Jon Dubravac and
Saia Makakaufaki.</TE>
<TE>   Among them, only Dubravac, a receiver who was a redshirt last
season, has not played the last four years in succession, a rocky
stretch in which the Bruins are 21-20.</TE>
<TE>   Today's opponent might be the softest left on the schedule.
Stanford (2-4, 1-2) might be without starting quarterback Chris
Lewis, and several veterans have underachieved under first-year Coach
Buddy Teevens.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford scores fewer points than any other Pac-10 team and
defense is the Bruins' strength. But UCLA has not forced a turnover
in its losses.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to have second effort and be more aggressive to force
fumbles and be in position for interceptions," Manning said. "You've
got to have the mentality that you are going to make them pay for
every mistake.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to take advantage because you never know how many
opportunities you get."</TE>
<TE>   The same can be said for a senior class that is running out of
time.</TE>

<LD>STANFORD (2-4, 1-2)</LD>
<LD>   at UCLA (4-3, 1-2)</LD>
<LD>   Today, 3:30 p.m., Rose Bowl</LD>
<TE>   TV -- Fox Sports Net.</TE>
<TE>   Radio -- KXTA (1150).</TE>
<TE>   WHEN UCLA HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   All eyes will be on Matt Moore, the expected starter at
quarterback. It will mark the first appearance for the freshman, who
was redshirting until injuries to Cory Paus and Drew Olson last week
thrust him to center stage. The game plan is simplified and audibles
will be at a minimum. Tailback Tyler Ebell should get 30 or more
carries against a defense that has allowed only 92 yards in 53
carries the last two games. Moore must complete some passes to keep
Stanford from crowding the line of scrimmage. Cardinal linebackers
blitz and the defensive ends sometimes fall back into coverage. UCLA
quarterbacks were sacked seven times last week and protecting the
rail-thin Moore was emphasized in practice.</TE>
<TE>   WHEN STANFORD HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   Redshirt freshman Kyle Matter, Moore's teammate at Newhall Hart
High, is expected to start because Chris Lewis did not practice all
week because of a bruised right shoulder. Lewis, however, could play.
Tall receiver Teyo Johnson, whose production has slipped since he
began the season with back-to-back 100-yard efforts, will draw
coverage from cornerback Matt Ware. UCLA is thin at safety because
Jibril Raymo (shoulder) is sidelined. Fullback Casey Moore averages
6.2 yards a carry.</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO UCLA VICTORY</TE>
<TE>   1. Field-good story: Moore must make enough plays for UCLA to win
the field-position battle in what should be a low-scoring game.</TE>
<TE>   2. Turning it around: The Bruin defense has not forced any
turnovers in the three losses. Recovering fumbles and intercepting
passes will be necessary to put the offense in good position.</TE>
<TE>   3. Reverse trend: The UCLA offense must take advantage of red-zone
opportunities, a problem all season.</TE>

<HD>New Quarterback Needs Protection</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Introducing ... Matt Moore.</LD>
<LD>   The freshman UCLA quarterback makes his debut today. But he
doesn't want to be too visible. In fact, he'd like nothing more than
to conceal himself behind a wall of teammates.</LD>
<LD>   "Our line is very good," he said. "I should have time to do what I
need to do."</LD>
<TE>   Pass protection, however, has been lacking. Opponents have blitzed
UCLA silly -- although the resulting injuries to quarterbacks Cory
Paus and Drew Olson have no one laughing.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins have allowed 22 sacks -- seven against California last
week -- and rank ninth in the Pacific 10 Conference. The problem has
been ongoing. UCLA quarterbacks were sacked a conference-high 102
times from 1999 to 2001, but never before have the results been so
disastrous.</TE>
<TE>   Responsibility does not rest solely with the offensive line.
Freshmen fullbacks Keith Carter and J.D. Groves are still in the
learning stages. Redshirt freshman tailback Tyler Ebell, 5 feet 9 and
170 pounds, is hard-pressed to handle blitzing linebackers.</TE>
<TE>   And Moore must deliver the ball promptly. Paus had a tendency to
take too long because he often looked to throw long passes.</TE>
<TE>   Look for Moore -- or fellow freshmen  Olson and John Sciarra -- to
drop back quickly and throw short passes. "We're going to call passes
that our quarterback has a chance to complete," Coach Bob Toledo
said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Compared to the quarterbacks and fullbacks, Ebell is beginning to
feel as experienced as Emmitt Smith, although he has started only two
games.</TE>
<TE>   "With all the injuries, I've got to feel like a veteran and
continue to step up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ebell has rushed for 424 yards in the last three games, silencing
critics who said he was too small to be an every-down back. The next
question is whether he can block well enough to help protect the
quarterback on passing plays.</TE>
<TE>   Offensive coordinator Kelly Skipper said Ebell was making progress
in that area too. "Tyler blocks pretty good," he said. "He lacks
experience in pass protection -- he rarely had to do that in high
school. But he's definitely coming on."</TE>
<TE>   Backup tailback Akil Harris weighs 214 pounds and sometimes
replaces Ebell on passing downs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The trombone section of the Stanford band will have a familiar
sound to UCLA receiver Tab Perry.</TE>
<TE>   His sister Tanicia, 23, a recent Stanford graduate, still plays
the instrument in the band at football games. Perry's parents also
are Stanford graduates.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the odd one out," he said.</TE>

<HD>Palmer's Last Chance to Be an Autzen Master</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>EUGENE, Ore.</DL>
<LD>His first visit here made him a starter, his second made him a
redshirt and his third left him yearning for one last shot at victory
in Autzen Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   USC quarterback Carson Palmer gets it today when the 15th-ranked
Trojans play No. 14 Oregon in an apparent make-or-break Pacific 10
Conference game for both teams.</LD>
<LD>   Because of quirks in the Pac-10's scheduling format, this will be
Palmer's fourth appearance before one of the toughest and noisiest
crowds in college football. It also makes Palmer, a redshirt senior,
one of the rare college players who will have faced an opponent five
times in his career.</LD>
<TE>   So far, Palmer is 0 for Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been waiting for this one for a long time," Palmer said.
"I've played well against them a couple of times but not well enough,
obviously. I definitely have some unfinished business."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer, who this week was named one of five finalists for the
Unitas award, has completed 60.3% of his passes for 1,981 yards and
13 touchdowns with seven interceptions. Last week, he tied a school
record by passing for four touchdowns in a 41-21 victory over
Washington that improved the Trojans' record to 5-2 overall and 3-1
in the Pac-10.</TE>
<TE>   "He's always been a great athlete, but he's playing like a great
quarterback right now," Oregon Coach Mike Bellotti said.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon (6-1, 2-1) is not looking forward to facing Palmer after
Arizona State's Andrew Walter torched its secondary for a
conference-record 536 yards passing last week. The 45-42 defeat ended
the Ducks' hopes for a national title and their winning streak at 11.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon, however, has won 29 of its last 31 home games -- and
Palmer has come out on the losing end in three of them.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, he replaced Mike Van Raaphorst in the second and third
quarters and completed 10 of 19 passes for 179 yards. But he also
made a costly error late in the fourth quarter when he let the
25-second clock expire deep in Duck territory and cost USC a possible
touchdown in a 17-13 loss. Nevertheless, his performance propelled
him into the starting lineup the next week against Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The next year, Palmer broke his collarbone in the Pac-10 opener at
Eugene when he lowered his shoulder and tried to get out of bounds on
a play in the final minute of the first half. The Ducks won, 33-30,
in triple overtime and Palmer had to redshirt.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, after the Trojans had lost to the Ducks at the
Coliseum in 2000, Palmer returned to Autzen Stadium and completed 25
of 40 passes for a career-best 411 yards and two touchdowns. But he
also threw three interceptions, one of which was returned for a
touchdown, and the Ducks won, 24-22, on a 32-yard field goal with 12
seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans, who have not defeated a ranked Pac-10 team on the
road since 1995, need a strong effort from Palmer and a stellar
performance from the conference's top defense if they hope to defeat
the Ducks, who have not lost consecutive home games since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "After losing like they did last week, they're going to be in a
hurry to show that they are still a good team, that they still can
dominate at home," USC linebacker Melvin Simmons said.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon running back Onterrio Smith ranks sixth in the nation and
first in the Pac-10 in rushing, averaging 133.7 yards a game. Jason
Fife has not missed a beat after replacing Joey Harrington at
quarterback. The redshirt junior is second in the nation and first in
the conference with an efficiency rating of 162.1.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can't stop the run then you can't stop anything," USC
Coach Pete Carroll said. "If we have trouble stopping the running
game, then they'll beat us because it will give them a chance to mix
in the passing game."</TE>
<TE>   Trojan defensive end Kenechi Udeze said the Trojans also must
neutralize the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're on your A game and you're doing all the stuff you're
supposed to, you'll get the crowd to simmer down," he said.
"Hopefully, we get our job done and the crowd starts to pack up and
go home early."</TE>
<TE>   Given the recent history of close games between the teams, the
outcome more likely will be decided in the final minute.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as we win," Palmer said. "We're definitely due."</TE>

<LD>   Today, 12:30 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   Autzen Stadium</TE>
<TE>   TV -- Ch. 7. Radio -- KMPC (1540)</TE>
<TE>   WHEN USC HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Carson Palmer burned Washington with play-action
passes and the Trojans will probably employ the same strategy against
a Duck defense that ranks last in the Pacific 10 Conference in pass
defense at 291.6 yards a game. Freshman receiver Mike Williams caught
three of Palmer's four touchdown passes against Washington and will
probably start again in place of Kareem Kelly, who has a sprained
right ankle but will play. Sultan McCullough will start at tailback
and probably receive the bulk of the carries, but Justin Fargas is
expected to get increased opportunities. Linebackers Kevin Mitchell
and David Moretti lead the Oregon defense, which is giving up 21
points and 367 yards a game.</TE>
<TE>   WHEN OREGON HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   Onterrio Smith is the Pac-10's leading rusher at 133.7 yards a
game. Quarterback Jason Fife, who played at Lake Elsinore Temescal
Canyon High, is second nationally in passing efficiency and throws to
a corps of receivers that includes Keenan Howry and Samie Parker and
tight end George Wrighster. Kicker Jared Siegel beat USC last season
with a field goal with 12 seconds left and has made 12 of 13 attempts
this season, including a 59-yarder in a 31-30 win over UCLA. USC's
defense is the stingiest in the Pac-10, allowing 18 points and 286.1
yards a game.</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO USC VICTORY</TE>
<TE>   1. Control Onterrio Smith: Smith has gained 100 yards or more in
each of his seven games. USC has not allowed an opposing player to
gain more than 100 yards.</TE>
<TE>   2. Execute the kicking game: Ryan Killeen must continue to kick
off into the end zone. He also must maintain the consistency he has
demonstrated on field-goal and extra-point attempts since struggling
against Washington State three weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   3. Neutralize the crowd: Autzen Stadium will be rocking as usual,
though the 12:30 start might result in a less rowdy atmosphere.</TE>

<DL>EUGENE, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Oregon receiver Keenan Howry and USC receiver Kareem Kelly will
probably make history together when No. 15 USC plays No. 14 Oregon
today at Autzen Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Howry and Kelly, both seniors, have caught passes in 42
consecutive games in which they have played. So it is likely they
will break the Pacific 10 Conference record they share with Dennis
Northcutt, who played at Arizona from 1996-99.</LD>
<LD>   Howry, who played at Los Alamitos High, has a reception in every
game since being shut out in his college debut at Michigan State in
1998. Kelly, who played at Long Beach Poly, sat out against Arizona
in 2000 because of an injury.</LD>
<TE>   Both players also have a shot at breaking the NCAA record of 46
consecutive games with a reception set by Carl Winston of New Mexico
in 1990-93.</TE>
<TE>   Including today's game, USC and Oregon have five regular-season
games remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Howry has caught 15 passes for 192 yards in three games against
the Trojans. USC, however, is the only Pac-10 school on which Howry
has not scored a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly has 12 receptions for 297 yards and one touchdown in three
games against Oregon. He scored on a 93-yard pass play against the
Ducks last season, but has no touchdowns against Stanford, Arizona
State, Arizona and Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oregon's roster includes 55 players from California.</TE>
<TE>   Troy Polamalu, USC's All-American safety, is the only USC player
who played high school football in Oregon. He attended Douglas High
in Winston.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The forecast is for mostly sunny skies and a high of 60
degrees.... As part of an $89.7-million project, seating capacity at
Autzen Stadium increased from 41,698 to 54,000 since last season.
Today's game is expected to be the 22nd consecutive sellout.... USC
leads, 33-15-2, in its series with Oregon, which dates to 1915. The
Trojans, however, have lost four in a row and five of the last six.</TE>

<HD>Short Game Could Go Long Way for Palmer</HD>

<LD>Statement games in October do not always make or break a football
team's Rose Bowl hopes, but that might very well be the case today
for USC, which will face Oregon in a Pacific 10 Conference showdown
at Autzen Stadium in Eugene.</LD>
<LD>   For the Trojans, who have lost four consecutive games to the Ducks
and have not won at Oregon since 1993, the key to victory will be the
play of senior quarterback Carson Palmer.</LD>
<LD>   As a one-time harsh critic of Palmer, I've noticed a vast
improvement in his game this season in leading the Trojans to a 5-2
record. In his second season under Coach Pete Carroll and offensive
coordinator Norm Chow, Palmer has been steady in completing 164 of
272 passes for 1,981 yards and 13 touchdowns.</LD>
<TE>   "Carson Palmer is playing like everyone thought he would," Oregon
State Coach Dennis Erickson said before Palmer passed for 231 yards
and two touchdowns against the Beavers this season. "He's such a
talent. He's not making mistakes and has a great arm and is throwing
it well."</TE>
<TE>   Having a big target to throw to in freshman Mike Williams has
definitely helped Palmer, who struggles when he's taken out of his
comfort zone. By having Palmer better prepared for opponents each
week, Chow has been able to get his quarterback to cut down on his
mental mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of looking to complete low-percentage bombs to shaky
wideout Kareem Kelly, as he has done in years past, Palmer, who holds
six USC passing and total-offense records, has done a better job of
taking what defenses are giving him.</TE>
<TE>   When Palmer has faced secondaries with two deep safeties, he has
completed passes underneath. When defenses have crowded the line of
scrimmage, Palmer has found receivers deep.</TE>
<TE>   Last week in an impressive victory over Washington at the
Coliseum, Palmer executed this simple attack to perfection in passing
for 346 yards and four touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   At first glance, one would think Palmer should have a monster game
against Oregon, which gave up 536 yards passing and four touchdowns
to Arizona State's Andrew Walter in a 45-42 loss to the Sun Devils
last week.</TE>
<TE>   But as ESPN's Lee Corso says, "Not so fast my friend."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer has previously come up short in big games on the road in
front of hostile crowds, so maybe Trojan fans should wait a day
before making New Year's Day plans for Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer's biggest challenge today might be keeping USC's offense
from getting rattled by the Oregon crowd's noise.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks rely on creating a chaotic atmosphere for opponents in
an attempt to cover up major holes in their defense. It will be up to
Palmer to keep the Trojan offense calm and focused enough to take
advantage of a weak secondary, which lost last season's dominant
cornerback duo, Rashad Bauman and Steve Smith, to graduation.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks start three players in their secondary with Southland
ties. Freshman cornerback Aaron Gipson is from Alta Loma, junior
cornerback Steven Moore played at Dorsey High and senior strong
safety Rasuli Webster is from Brea. They, along with safety Keith
Lewis and backup defensive backs Charles Favroth and Marques Binns,
make up a secondary that was exposed by the Sun Devils last week.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon was able to take a 21-point lead in the first half by
limiting Arizona State's big plays on first down. No matter the
formation they faced, the Ducks played their cornerbacks off on first
downs, often with a 10-yard cushion between them and the receivers.</TE>
<TE>   Short passes on first down to USC wide receivers and tight ends
should be there all day for Palmer, but he cannot afford to stare at
his receivers, a bad habit of his. Gipson and Moore may not be the
fastest players in the world, but they are quick and aggressive, and
if Palmer tips his hand too early, or if USC's receivers run sloppy
patterns, the cornerbacks will make them pay.</TE>
<TE>   Against Arizona State, Oregon, which loves to blitz on running
downs and use man coverage in the secondary, was hurt by play-action
plays in the second half. Palmer should be able to exploit this ploy
too, but he'll have to be sharper with his fakes.</TE>
<TE>   In USC's first loss, at Kansas State, Palmer and the Trojan backs
were sloppy on play-action plays and the Wildcats shut them down.
Because Kansas State was never truly threatened with a run, the
Wildcats were able to key on Palmer and make his night miserable as
he completed only 18 of 47 passes for 186 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Keary Colbert, Williams and Kelly are dangerous receivers when
they have room to work, but they've had their problems when defensive
backs play them physically. USC receivers dropped six passes against
Kansas State, five of them after they were either bumped off their
routes or hit on the catches.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas State, and to some extent Washington State, which handed
the Trojans their other defeat, were successful in jamming USC's
receivers at the line of scrimmage. This tactic not only makes it
more difficult for wideouts to get off the ball but the tight
defensive coverage often disrupts Palmer's passing rhythm.</TE>
<TE>   Expect the Ducks to copy that game plan today.</TE>
<TE>   This all-or-nothing scheme, however, can be dangerous. That's why
several Pac-10 receivers have had career games against the Ducks this
season.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State's Shaun McDonald had 12 catches for 204 yards,
Arizona's Bobby Wade caught 12 passes for 151 yards and UCLA's Craig
Bragg snagged nine passes for 230 yards, all against Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   And the Ducks' secondary gives up the yards in big chunks. Oregon
has allowed touchdown passes of 55, 53, 71, 46, 67 and 48 yards over
the last two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "In this conference, you've got to have quick feet and a short
memory because you're going to get beat," Oregon Coach Mike Bellotti
told the Oregonian earlier this week. "What matters is how you get up
and the attitude you take about the next play ... or game."</TE>
<TE>   And USC can only hope that the Ducks have to remind themselves of
this again next week.</TE>

<HD>Captured Arms Will Stop Going to Afghan Militia</HD>
<DH>U.S. forces drop the practice after criticism that it
fueled fighting between rival warlords.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BAGRAM, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>The U.S. military has stopped handing over confiscated weapons to
Afghan militia fighters after criticism that it was strengthening
regional warlords at the expense of the national government.</LD>
<LD>   The change was made quietly after reports Oct. 16 that weapons
caches were going to militia fighters traveling with American forces,
U.S. military spokesman Col. Roger King said Friday. Critics worried
that arming private militias would fuel fighting between rival
warlords, destabilize Afghanistan and undermine the fragile
government of President Hamid Karzai.</LD>
<LD>   King said commanders decided that the practice conflicted with
U.S. efforts to train an Afghan national army.</LD>
<TE>   "We realized there was some discrepancy between what may be going
on in the field and what the actual policy was supposed to be," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Almost every day, U.S. forces searching along Afghanistan's border
with Pakistan find caches of weapons and ammunition. On Thursday,
special forces based in the town of Orgun found 148 82-millimeter
mortar rounds, 700 rounds of heavy machine gun ammunition and five
antipersonnel mines.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the finds are destroyed. But until the policy change,
fighters traveling with the U.S. forces were given their pick of
usable materiel. Other militia fighters in the area had second pick,
and the Afghan National Army, which has fewer than 2,000 fighters,
was last.</TE>
<TE>   King said U.S. commanders had been trying to ensure the forces
aiding them were well supplied.</TE>
<TE>   "For clarity's sake, we've gone back out and said, 'This is it,
this is cut and dried: It either goes to the Afghan National Army at
the Kabul military training facility ... or it is destroyed.' "</TE>
<TE>   King said the change might hurt the readiness of those aiding
Americans but that it might force the Afghans to turn to the Defense
Ministry for weapons, reinforcing central government.</TE>

<HD>Terrorism, Not Trade, at Top of APEC Agenda</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Boudreaux</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CABO SAN LUCAS, Mexico</DL>
<LD>An ocean away from the most volatile parts of their region, leaders
of Pacific Rim governments meeting here this weekend are expected to
adopt an ambitious U.S. plan to dry up financing for terrorists and
strengthen security procedures for air travel and shipping.</LD>
<LD>   The plan would require the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation group, or APEC, to send passenger lists to one another
ahead of the arrivals of aircraft and ships. It would also oblige
them to inspect shipping containers before they leave for other APEC
members' ports, tighten baggage screening at airports and reinforce
cockpits. All are steps the United States is starting to take at
home.</LD>
<LD>   A draft of the voluntary accord -- awaiting approval by President
Bush and the leaders of China, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico and other
governments -- also pledges to "suppress the financing of terrorism"
through better monitoring of charities and nonprofit organizations as
well as informal banking networks known in the Muslim world as
hawalas.</LD>
<TE>   Foreign ministers of the APEC members endorsed the U.S. proposal
at a meeting here Thursday but left the timing of the measures and
other details up to presidents and prime ministers who begin a
two-day summit here today.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell called it "a package of
bold joint actions to make the flow of trade, finance and
communication more secure." He said the United States and other
wealthy countries would help poorer ones pay for the new initiative,
which would cost billions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   APEC members have a total population of 2.6 billion and account
for nearly half the global economy. The group was formed in 1989 as a
trade association for the nations of Asia and the Americas. But its
two annual gatherings since the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States
have focused more on terrorism than tariffs.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's summit in Shanghai came six weeks after the attacks.
This year's gathering at the Mexican beach resort of Cabo San Lucas,
ringed by warships in the Gulf of California and hundreds of soldiers
on shore, comes on the heels of bloody terrorist attacks in Bali, the
Philippines and Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   Russian President Vladimir V. Putin is skipping the summit to
grapple with the crisis at home in which Chechen separatists held
hundreds hostage in a Moscow theater. South Korean President Kim Dae
Jung is coming, but his agenda has been affected by North Korea's
recent admission that it has a nuclear weapons program.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq, too, will be the topic of some discussion because Bush will
try, in his meetings with other leaders, to rally support for his
strategy against Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   But Powell said the president does not want that issue to distract
from the summit's central challenge: how to boost world trade and
economic growth in spite of terrorist threats.</TE>
<TE>   APEC's members are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New
Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea,
Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam. Many have been
directly hit by terrorist violence since the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Some corporate executives attending the summit said the focus here
on security is elbowing out critical discussions on trade.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a shame for those of us who want to push an agenda of free
trade and more commerce," said Nelson Cunningham, managing director
of the Washington consulting firm Kissinger McLarty Associates. "APEC
has been hijacked by the terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. officials said Friday that the proposed security
measures, which are far more specific than APEC's pledge of
counter-terrorism cooperation a year ago, will speed legitimate
commerce in the long run.</TE>
<TE>   Ambassador Lawrence Greenwood, the top U.S. liaison to APEC, said
state-of-the-art inspection equipment adopted in the last year is
already helping people and goods move through some U.S.-Canada border
checkpoints more quickly than they did before the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "We know much, much more about what's crossing that border now,"
he said, citing the measures as a model for the proposed security
regime. "We're able to let legitimate trade go faster, so we can
concentrate on the bad guys."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the proposed security measures would depend on private
financing. Seaports adopting the plan would be required to spend $1
million to $2 million for gamma-ray machines to screen containers,
U.S. officials said, and shipping companies would have to install
electronic locator beacons costing up to $16,000 per vessel. Training
of government inspectors would cost far more.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal carries no sanctions for noncompliance. But U.S.
officials say they hope that seaports, shipping lines and airlines
that adopt the security measures would gain a competitive edge based
on superior records of safety and efficiency.</TE>
<TE>   Some APEC members are already taking action.</TE>
<TE>   In May, the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia agreed to share
airline passenger lists. Last week, the United States and Singapore,
one of the world's busiest ports, agreed to search for weapons of
terror in the contents of shipping containers headed for each other's
shores.</TE>
<TE>   It is uncertain, however, whether all APEC members have the will
or the means to implement the full package of anti-terrorism
measures.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an enormous economic cost associated with terrorism,"
said New Zealand's foreign minister, Phil Goff, including the loss of
jobs, tourism and consumer confidence. "Counter-terrorism measures
themselves have an economic cost."</TE>

<HD>Islamists Pledge Loyalty After Bahraini Vote</HD>
<DH>Muslim political leaders try to overcome their chagrin that
their call for boycott was ignored.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tony Perry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MANAMA, Bahrain</DL>
<LD>Islamic political leaders struck a conciliatory tone Friday after
turnout figures showed that their calls for a boycott of this week's
parliamentary election fell short.</LD>
<LD>   "Yes, we will cooperate with the elected members, and it is wrong
not to do so," said Hawad Abdulwahabm, deputy chairman of the Islamic
Action Committee.</LD>
<LD>   If the Islamists were chagrined at the election outcome, leaders
of the women's political movement in this Persian Gulf nation were
exultant. Two of eight female candidates earned spots in a runoff
next week.</LD>
<TE>   "My main goal is, with God's blessing, to elevate the status of
Bahraini women," said Latifah Qaoud, 46, a training manager in the
Ministry of Finance, who will face a male opponent.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the boycott, 53.2% of voters went to the polls Thursday to
elect 40 members to a newly created parliament. It was the first
national election of legislators since the then-ruling emir disbanded
the previous parliament in 1975, four years after Bahrain received
independence from Britain.</TE>
<TE>   Islamic opponents of the regime had boasted that less than a third
of voters would go to the polls.</TE>
<TE>   The boycott may have hurt conservative Shiite Muslim candidates.
Whereas Shiites swept municipal elections in the spring, they
appeared to have split the seats in parliament evenly with Sunni
Muslim candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. and Britain have been watching the election and aftermath
to see whether Bahrain can avoid the turbulence that has occurred in
other Arab countries that have opened up their political processes.</TE>
<TE>   In Kuwait, for example, Islamists now dominate parliament and are
engaging in near-daily political skirmishes with the monarch,
including over political rights for women.</TE>
<TE>   In Bahrain, the stakes are increased because some Islamist leaders
have called for ousting the U.S. Navy from a base here that it uses
as a regional headquarters in the Persian Gulf.</TE>
<TE>   The Islamist leaders complained that under a new constitution, the
king, Sheik Hamed ibn Isa Khalifa, retains veto power over
legislation and can appoint all members of a second legislative body.
The king is Sunni.</TE>
<TE>   Friction between the Shiite and Sunni sects has long dominated
Bahraini politics and led to sporadic violence in the 1990s. Western
observers hoped that the election outcome would show a disaffection
among voters for continuing the religious feud.</TE>
<TE>   The debate over parliament's lack of power "is sometimes just a
mask for some people to exercise sectarian muscle," said British
Ambassador Peter Ford.</TE>
<TE>   In this spring's municipal elections, 30 women ran for office, but
none was elected. Before Thursday's election, prospective female
candidates agreed that only one woman would run in each district to
avoid a split vote.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very hopeful sign," Wajaweha Baharanh, director of the
Bahrain Women Society, said of the election. "You cannot have a
leadership in Bahrain or anywhere without women."</TE>
<TE>   Baharanh said the female candidates, if they win in next week's
runoff, will offer legislation about divorce, child custody and
"men's treatment of women."</TE>
<TE>   If either woman wins, she will become the first female member of
parliament among the small emirates in the Persian Gulf.</TE>
<TE>   Hugh Canavan, an analyst with the London-based Gulf Center for
Strategic Studies, said the lasting significance of the vote may be
in the enthusiasm of women, despite cultural strictures that
important decisions should be left to men.</TE>
<TE>   "The central message is when women are given a chance to vote,
they've taken it," Canavan said.</TE>

<HD>Chechen Rebel's Rise and Fall</HD>
<DH>Movsar Barayev, who took 700 theatergoers hostage in the
Russian capital, was a cruel bandit to some but sought to be a hero.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Holley and Alexei V. Kuznetsov</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>His foes called him one of the youngest, fiercest and cruelest of
Chechen gang leaders.</LD>
<LD>   But by seizing hundreds of hostages and taking the Chechen war to
the heart of Moscow, Movsar Barayev made a bid to become a hero -- or
martyr -- of Chechen separatists' struggle for independence in their
southern republic. That choice meant his death in a blaze of violence
early today, Russian authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   After Barayev, 23, and his fighters began killing hostages before
dawn, Russian forces stormed the building where about 700
theatergoers were being held. He was among those killed in the
battle, security official Pavel Kudryavtsev said.</LD>
<TE>   It remains to be seen whether his actions trigger enough disgust
with the war among ordinary Russians to benefit the Chechen fighters.
The results of his audacious raid could instead provoke a backlash
that hurts their cause and only strengthens President Vladimir V.
Putin's determination to crush the breakaway effort.</TE>
<TE>   The hostage-takers had demanded an end to the Russian government's
war on the separatists. Chechens won a degree of autonomy for their
republic in the Caucasus region after defeating Russian troops in a
1994-96 war. Russian forces marched back into the republic in 1999
and have battled guerrillas there since.</TE>
<TE>   Barayev was born in the city of Argun in Chechnya, where he grew
up in a typical five-floor apartment building.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a tender boy and was a good student," Zara Satsieva, a
neighbor in Argun, told NTV television. "I can't say anything bad
about him."</TE>
<TE>   But Barayev often was portrayed as a gangster who inherited a
kidnapping business once run by his warlord uncle, Arbi, who was
killed by Russian forces in June 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Arbi Barayev's gang was famous in Russia for kidnapping, torturing
and executing hostages. NTV television has run footage which it said
was from a video made before Arbi Barayev's death and sent to
relatives of one hostage. It shows an unshaven Movsar Barayev smiling
and twirling a knife, then lowering the blade toward the neck of an
unidentified woman.</TE>
<TE>   Movsar Barayev also was reported to have led a group accused of
using a vehicle full of explosives to blow up a Russian military
convoy in the Chechen village of Alkhan-Yurt on Dec. 9, 2000, killing
20 soldiers and wounding 17. However, some question whether there is
any real evidence of his involvement.</TE>
<TE>   Russian authorities regarded the younger Barayev, operating in the
Urus-Martan district of Chechnya, as a conduit for foreign funds sent
to the Chechen rebels. Russian security forces twice announced
incorrectly that Barayev had been killed, first in August 2001 and
again a few weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   "All the reports about him being the most cruel and fierce thug
started to circulate only upon Arbi's death," said Musa Muradov, an
ethnic Chechen who is the former editor of a newspaper in Chechnya
and who is now a correspondent for the Russian newspaper Kommersant.
"The federal side needed new scarecrows to frighten the public with,
and it needed to report its own victories. Hence these numerous
reports about Movsar having been killed a number of times."</TE>
<TE>   Russian media reported that Barayev received "terrorist training"
in Chechnya from an Arab commander known as Khattab, whom the
Russians subsequently killed. But Muradov said that the young man
could learn all he needed to know from his uncle and that he became a
natural leader.</TE>
<TE>   "His uncle gave him a perfect training. Arbi was tough, as tough
as it could get," Muradov said.</TE>
<TE>   Russian security officials say that, after taking over his uncle's
gang, the younger Barayev was known for kidnapping and using Chechen
teenagers in terrorist attacks. A Chechen news agency reported three
days after his uncle's death that Barayev had been appointed the new
commander of the "Islamic special purpose regiment."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Thursday inside the theater with correspondent
Mark Franchetti of London's Sunday Times, Barayev denied being a
terrorist. "All we ask for is to pull out the troops from Chechnya,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Vyacheslav Izmailov, a military analyst with the Novaya Gazeta
newspaper, said before the abrupt and bloody end to the standoff that
he thought Barayev was willing to negotiate and compromise.</TE>
<TE>   "If he truly wanted to kill these people he would simply have
blown up the building -- end of story," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Barayev grew up with the surname Suleimanov. However, after his
uncle's death he switched to using Barayev, "a name that is believed
to strike horror in many hearts in Russia, and chill the blood in
people's veins," Izmailov said. Barayev "brought the war to Moscow,"
he added, "something that Chechen rebels have been promising the
Kremlin for a long time."</TE>

Bali, Indonesia, was placed on a U.N. list of groups and individuals
with ties to the Al Qaeda terrorist group, as police took witnesses
back to the blast site to reconstruct the crime that claimed nearly
200 lives. Any person or group blacklisted is subject to
international sanctions, and nations are required to freeze their
assets, prevent their movements and block attempts to sell or
transfer arms to those on the list. Jemaah Islamiah has been tied to
several plots and attacks over the last two years.</LD>

<HD>Slaying in Malay Royal House Mired in Scandal</HD>
<DH>Raja's first wife is held for questioning but not charged
in the death of his second spouse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia</DL>
<LD>When the young and beautiful second wife of a raja who is second in
line to the throne of Perak state was found dead and bound at the
foot of a waterfall, the case had a whiff of royal intrigue.</LD>
<LD>   The mystery erupted into full-blown royal scandal Friday after
police detained the royal's older first wife, Raja Nor Mahani, for
questioning about the slaying this month.</LD>
<LD>   Malaysian newspapers splashed photographs of Raja Nor being led
from court by police after being remanded into custody Thursday. She
has not been charged.</LD>
<TE>   About the same time she was detained, five suspects in another
court were charged with murder or assisting in murder in the death of
Hazliza Ishak.</TE>
<TE>   Hazliza, a 26-year-old former model and aspiring actress, married
Raja Jaafar Raja Muda Musa in January in southern Thailand, becoming
the Perak royal's second wife after Raja Nor, 60, a former
schoolteacher.</TE>
<TE>   Raja Jaafar, 62, is second in line to become Perak's sultan under
Malaysia's complicated ascension process. Nine of Malaysia's 13
states have a sultan, a position that carries no lawmaking power but
great wealth and reverence.</TE>
<TE>   Hazliza's body was found, with hands and feet tied, on Oct. 11,
and police said they believed she had been strangled before being
thrown from a bridge.</TE>
<TE>   Charged with murder Thursday were Mat Saad Mat Isa, a farmer;
Sabarudin Non, a carpenter, and fisherman J. Manimaran.</TE>
<TE>   An employee at Raja Jaafar's palace, Aristonsjah Tengku Mohamad
Ansany, and Rahim Ismail, who is unemployed, were charged with
abetting murder.</TE>
<TE>   The suspects, who face the death penalty if convicted, did not
enter pleas during Thursday's hearing.</TE>

hostages. An Australian diplomat was told that the number was no more
than 10, and that none of the estimated 75 foreigners were among the
dead. However, a police officer said he saw "a lot of corpses."</LD>
<TE>   In addition, two hostages were confirmed killed before the
operation began.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, as former hostages were being taken away in buses,
Deputy Interior Minister Vladimir Vasilyev told reporters: "We have
succeeded in preventing massive death and the destruction of the
building" by the militants, who had vowed to die in the name of Islam
and for the cause of Chechen independence.</TE>
<TE>   It was a swift and violent ending to a hostage crisis that began
Wednesday evening when 40 to 50 Chechen rebels interrupted a
performance of a Russian musical and took the audience and most of
its cast hostage.</TE>
<TE>   Reporters at the scene began hearing explosions and gunfire about
5:30 this morning. By 7 a.m., it was all over -- with Russian troops
in control of the theater and forensic experts examining the corpses.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the hostage-takers were captured and a few may have
escaped into the city, Vasilyev said, calling on Muscovites to give
them no help and report any sightings to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to warn bandits and society that we have all
information about them and that if they give up, we will guarantee
their lives," he added.</TE>
<TE>   News agency photographers at the scene said they could see "dozens
of bodies" being carried off. But it wasn't clear whether they were
hostages or the rebels who, some with explosives strapped to their
bodies, had accompanied Chechen rebel leader Movsar Barayev on his
desperate bid to bring the separatist war to Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   It was also unclear how many of the casualties were in fact dead
and how many were suffering the effects of a sleeping gas used in the
assault, according to state television reports.</TE>
<TE>   The Chechens' audacious raid, less than three miles from the
Kremlin, ignited a fresh debate here about the wisdom of Russia's war
in the breakaway Caucasian republic.</TE>
<TE>   At a school where the relatives of the hostages had held their
vigil, women could be seen crying and men praying as they waited to
hear whether their loved ones would be coming home. When the
relatives heard that Barayev was dead, they cheered and whistled
their approval.</TE>
<TE>   Valery Shantsev, the deputy mayor of Moscow, said the night's
killing began when the Chechens inside the building shot to death a
man outside the theater who they believed was trying to enter the
building. Later, a spokesman for the police said that the rebels had
killed two of the hostages and wounded two others.</TE>
<TE>   When the killing began, police spokesman Pavel Kudryavtsev said, a
group of hostages tried to make a break from the building and were
shot at by the Chechens. That was when special federal police
commandos, the Spetsnaz, moved in.</TE>
<TE>   A Spetsnaz officer, who gave his name only as Andrei, described
the storming of the theater to a Times reporter.</TE>
<TE>   "It lasted about 40 minutes. We got a sudden order ... definitely
not planned. We believe the nerves of some of the hostages failed,
and they decided to try to escape no matter what," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Naturally, the terrorists started shooting, and that is when we
got the order to move in.... We fired and sometimes we could not see
the difference between the hostages and those who held them. There
are a lot of corpses there, and there are a lot of wounded people."</TE>
<TE>   A hostage named Natalia Skoptseva was on her phone talking to the
Echo of Moscow radio station when the assault began.</TE>
<TE>   "We beg you not to storm the building," she was saying.</TE>
<TE>   Just then, another hostage named Anna came on the line.</TE>
<TE>   "They let some gas in," she said, referring to the police. "We
feel it. We now are breathing into handkerchiefs. They are taking us!
They will kill us! Soldiers are coming!"</TE>
<TE>   The call then became a cacophony of the sounds of shooting and
screaming as the assault took place, before the line went dead.</TE>
<TE>   The commercial director for the "Nord-Ost" musical that was
showing when the rebels took over recalled the scene he happened upon
after the raid.</TE>
<TE>   "When we got permission to go into the building to collect the
bodies of our friends, we saw a horrible sight," Dmitri Bogachyov
said. "Everything was smashed and ... people were lying around
everywhere, on the floor, in the chairs. They looked like they were
dead, but in fact were alive. I have never seen anything more
horrible in my life, and I am sure the scene will haunt my nightmares
for some time."</TE>
<TE>   Russian television gave no details on the type of "sleeping gas"
used during the assault.</TE>
<TE>   Police would not have moved if the militants had not begun killing
the hostages, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the past two hours, the fighters unexpectedly opened fire
and killed two of their hostages, and wounded two more, a woman and a
man," Kudryavtsev, the police spokesman, said at 6 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   After that, several dozen Russian troops in camouflage were
spotted by reporters moving in the direction of the theater and a
group of ambulances arrived at the scene. An armored personnel
carrier maneuvered nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said that President Vladimir V. Putin was kept abreast
of the operation. The rebels had demanded that he withdraw the
estimated 80,000 Russian troops now in the republic of Chechnya or
the hostages would be killed.</TE>
<TE>   The action occurred after a day of increasing tension. Government
officials said they tried without success to come up with a proposal
that would draw the hostage-takers into serious, detailed
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   The threat to kill hostages Friday reached the outside world from
several sources: an actor held captive inside the theater who made a
telephone call to the theater director in Moscow; a journalist
calling from Turkey who managed to reach one of the hostage-takers;
and a respected mediator, journalist Anna Politkovskaya.</TE>
<TE>   Politkovskaya, an independent journalist who spent five hours
inside the theater with the rebels Friday hoping to mediate the
crisis, said the mood among the tired, hungry and unkempt hostages
had been of enormous foreboding. She also said that the
hostage-takers appeared to her to be determined in their lethal
intent.</TE>
<TE>   "They seriously mean to blow themselves up, together with the
hostages, if the demands are not met," she said. "I have little doubt
about that."</TE>
<TE>   Politkovskaya, who cut short a U.S. visit this week and canceled a
Los Angeles appearance to return to Moscow, was allowed to meet with
about 20 of the captives in a room separate from the main auditorium,
but still under the eyes of the militants.</TE>
<TE>   "Even in Chechnya I haven't seen people in such a demoralized
state as the hostages I spoke with," she told The Times early today.
"They have lost all hope. They think the country has abandoned them
and no one will help them."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, 19 hostages, including eight children, had been
released from the theater by their captors. The children, one toting
a teddy bear, all appeared healthy in spite of their ordeal.</TE>
<TE>   However, efforts of foreign ambassadors in Moscow to secure the
release of an estimated 75 foreigners fell through. Among the
hostages were two or three Americans, U.S. officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, some of the relatives of the hostages had demonstrated
for peace and increased their demands that Putin call off the
3-year-old war against separatists in Chechnya. On a rain-soaked
fence near the theater, a protester had hung a sign: "President
Putin, the lives of our children are in your hands."</TE>
<TE>   Politkovskaya, whose risky reporting of human rights abuses inside
Chechnya in recent years has infuriated the Kremlin while winning her
accolades in the West, said she was struck especially by how hostages
stuck inside the building since Wednesday night compared themselves
to the 118 Russian sailors killed aboard the Russian nuclear
submarine Kursk in 2000, some slowly suffocating when no help came.</TE>
<TE>   Sergei Mironov, the speaker of the Federation Council, the upper
house of parliament, tried Friday to reassure relatives of the
hostages. "Believe me, the main task of these negotiations is to
ensure the safety of all the hostages without exception," he said.
"Trust me. We are doing all we can."</TE>
<TE>   Mironov denied anything was afoot when asked by one woman if the
government was preparing to use force to try to free the hostages.
"At the moment," he said, "no actions are being planned which could
in any way harm the hostages."</TE>
<TE>   But he also cautioned, "We are ready for any turn that events
might take."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in the Chechen capital, Grozny, and other parts of the
republic where Russian forces are in control, many Chechen officials
and ordinary people Friday condemned the hostage-taking, with rallies
against it held in various districts.</TE>
<TE>   "Right after I heard that hostages were taken in Moscow, I became
terrified, because I thought that the situation in Chechnya can only
get worse because of that," said Tamara Khamkhoyeva, an ethnic
Chechen student at the University of Grozny.</TE>
<TE>   "Cruelty gives rise to another cruelty, and nothing good can be
expected from cruelty."</TE>

<HD>Kenyan President Moi Makes His Exit Official</HD>
<DH>He dissolves parliament, launches the campaign to succeed
him, which will end his 24-year rule.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NAIROBI, Kenya</DL>
<LD>President Daniel Arap Moi officially announced the end of his 24-year
rule of Kenya on Friday, dissolving parliament and kicking off
campaigning that pits the son of the nation's first president against
a veteran opposition politician.</LD>
<LD>   No date has been set for the election -- the first in which a
Kenyan president has been constitutionally obliged to step down --
but it must be held within 90 days. It will be the third election
since the return of multiparty politics in 1991.</LD>
<LD>   With Moi out of the race, the ruling Kenya African National Union
has nominated Uhuru Kenyatta, son of Moi's predecessor, Jomo
Kenyatta, for president. Moi came to power when Jomo Kenyatta died in
1978.</LD>
<TE>   Uhuru Kenyatta, a relative political novice, faces an opposition
unified like never before.</TE>
<TE>   His toughest challenge is likely to come from Mwai Kibaki, 71, a
former vice president who leads a key alliance of opposition parties
known as the National Rainbow Coalition.</TE>
<TE>   "These are probably as significant elections as we have ever had
since independence," said the Rev. Mutava Musyimi, secretary-general
of the National Council of Churches of Kenya.</TE>
<TE>   The elections will take place as the nation of 31 million people,
once a success story in a region of turmoil and underdevelopment,
weathers its worst economic crisis since independence from Britain in
1963.</TE>
<TE>   Critics blame corruption and government mismanagement.</TE>
<TE>   Kenyatta has already said he would seek Moi's advice if elected,
and the 78-year-old Moi -- who will remain KANU's chairman -- has
said he wants to stay involved in politics.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition officials say this is their best opportunity to break
KANU's 39-year grip on power. In the past, the opposition has been
beset by huge divisions, mainly along tribal lines, but this year
there appears to be unprecedented unity.</TE>
<TE>   Kibaki, who was Moi's vice president from 1978 to 1988, leads an
alliance of more than 10 parties -- including ruling party dissidents
and four of the 14 candidates who lost to Moi in 1997 elections.
Kibaki finished second to Moi.</TE>
<TE>   Moi dissolved parliament two days before a convention was to begin
work on a new constitution that would restrict the president's powers
and establish the post of prime minister. That review is supposed to
continue after the election.</TE>

<HD>Free Trade Proves Devastating for Mexican Farmers</HD>
<DH>Whether raising hogs or crops, few can compete with U.S.
agribusiness in the NAFTA era.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Kraul</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>QUERETARO, Mexico</DL>
<LD>Ask hog farmer Juan Manuel Maya what free trade has done for him, and
he'll tell you in a broken voice, standing amid his silent and empty
pens, that it has destroyed him.</LD>
<LD>   Maya called it quits this month after 20 years, selling off the
last of the 1,200 sows that once produced thousands of piglets
annually for feedlots all over Mexico. A veterinarian, Maya loved hog
farming, plowed $2 million into leading-edge technology and was
considered a pillar of his industry.</LD>
<LD>   But it wasn't enough to ensure survival. Like thousands of other
Mexican hog farmers, Maya, 61, was overwhelmed by the U.S. swine
imports that have flooded this country since the North American Free
Trade Agreement took effect in 1994. The trade pact is gradually
erasing tariffs on all U.S. farm products, forcing a head-to-head
competition that few Mexican growers are up to.</LD>
<TE>   "What a sad place. What was all prosperity and productivity is now
like a cemetery," said Maya of his farm, which once bustled with 35
employees and the arrivals of a dozen big trucks a week to haul his
piglets away. Deserted and deathly quiet, his farm 125 miles
northwest of Mexico City is up for sale.</TE>
<TE>   NAFTA has been beneficial for Mexico in many ways. It has opened
up the economy to foreign investment, helped modernize industry,
lowered consumer prices and encouraged democratic reforms. Industrial
exports have boomed.</TE>
<TE>   But few would argue that NAFTA has been anything but devastating
for Mexican farm families, which account for 23% of Mexico's 100
million people. Many farmers simply cannot compete with low-cost U.S.
imports of grain, vegetable and livestock now pouring into Mexico at
low or zero duty. Maya and thousands like him are giving up.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. farms are getting bigger and bigger and have become much more
efficient producers than almost any growers in the world. That
efficiency is aided by high-tech growing techniques, low-cost
financing and enormous government production subsidies, exemplified
by the $190-billion farm bill passed in May.</TE>
<TE>   It's not just Mexico's hog farmers who are suffering. Growers of
corn, rice, pineapples, sugar, apples and poultry are foundering in
the sea of U.S. imports. Farm failures are thought to be causing an
exodus of peasants from the country to the cities -- and to the
United States. Maya said 17 of the 35 employees he let go have
immigrated illegally to the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   But hog farmers are among the hardest hit. A third of Mexico's
18,000 swine producers have gone out of business since NAFTA took
effect, the Mexican Hog Farmers Assn. says. Why? U.S. pork imports
have more than doubled and have grabbed a 40% market share among
Mexico's consumers and food processing firms, up from just 5% before.</TE>
<TE>   The value of U.S. hog imports in Mexico rose to $344.9 million
last year, more than double the $134.7 million in 1993, the year
before NAFTA took effect. Meanwhile, Mexican hog exports to the
United States were just $4.5 million, half the $11 million in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Maya has no doubt that it was time to exit. He knew that price
competition would only intensify Jan. 1, when the final remnants of
import duties on U.S. hogs and hundreds of other agricultural items
are eliminated, allowing all U.S. farm products except corn, powdered
milk and beans to enter Mexico duty-free. In 2008, tariffs on those
three final categories will be abolished.</TE>
<TE>   He also feared the consequences of the 10-year, $190-billion farm
subsidy bill that took effect Oct. 1. It raised existing U.S.
government support by 78%, a move that tilted the playing field even
more.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers aren't sitting idly by. Protests, marches and roadblocks
by growers are increasingly common in Mexico: 900 hog farmers from
all over Mexico shut the Nuevo Laredo border crossing in June for
four hours. The commotion has prompted President Vicente Fox's
promise to take a hard line in his meeting today with President Bush
at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Baja California.</TE>
<TE>   Fox said last week that he will ask Bush to cut the subsidy
package, which he warned could further damage Mexican farmers and
accelerate illegal migration.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to be adamant. We are analyzing the latest measures
that the United States has taken in [agriculture], and however small
they may be, if there is a violation in the free trade agreement, we
will act with the greatest firmness," Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   Other top government officials also are talking tough. Economy
Minister Luis Ernesto Derbez warned that the government would file
more anti-dumping claims against the U.S. unless something is done to
fix the "asymmetrical" farm trade relationship. Agriculture Ministry
officials have promised to give hard-pressed farmers some sort of
financial "armor" but have not specified what it might be or how it
would be paid for.</TE>
<TE>   But there is little chance of reimposing tariffs, as some Mexican
legislators have demanded. NAFTA changes require legislative approval
of the U.S., Mexico and third signatory Canada -- a renegotiation
process that could hurt Mexico more than help it, said Gustavo Vega
Canovas, a political scientist and NAFTA expert at Colegio de Mexico
in Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   "That could open a Pandora's box by giving all NAFTA opponents in
the United States and Canada who were not happy with the original
agreement the opportunity to ask for something too," Vega said.</TE>
<TE>   What went wrong for Mexico's farmers? NAFTA's agriculture
provisions were based on the assumption that a phased-in elimination
of most farm tariffs over a 10-year period would give Mexican farmers
time to modernize, invest in technology and be ready for head-to-head
competition Jan. 1, 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers like Maya bought into it. So did his neighbor, hog farmer
Enrique Flores, a Texas A&amp;M University graduate who sank $3 million
into modernizing and expanding his sheds, including feeding systems,
manure processing and sanitation measures.</TE>
<TE>   But the assumptions proved hopelessly optimistic. Eight years
after NAFTA, Mexican farmers pay more for virtually every farm cost
except labor, from grain -- which accounts for 55% of the cost of
raising a hog -- to machinery and trucking, electricity and credit.
That makes competition a losing proposition.</TE>
<TE>   Flores said his grain costs are 20% higher than those of his U.S.
competitors -- if he pays in cash. Borrowing to pay for it only
deepens the disadvantage, because he pays interest rates of 25% for a
farm loan, three times what U.S. growers are charged.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican farmers have also been hurt by the government's failure to
impose and enforce agricultural norms and standards, said Kenneth
Shwedel, vice president of research at Rabobank, a Dutch
agro-business bank with a branch in Mexico City. Hog farmers say that
the lack of supervision has opened the door to cheap, poor-quality
meat imports for use by Mexican food processors, products that they
say are unacceptable by U.S. standards.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican farmers are still suffering -- as are many Mexican
businesses -- from the financial crisis and bank failures of 1995.
Its aftermath forced banks to raise the cost of loans and severely
limit lending, which in turn have inhibited growth in farming and
other sectors.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique Dominguez, director of the Mexican Hog Farmers Assn., said
his members have problems in spades: 85% of those who remain are
losing money.</TE>
<TE>   "How can we have an open market when we have such different
policies on each side of the border, one side benefiting from $19
billion a year in subsidies and the other much less? We need a
compensatory system or one side is going to do away with the other,"
Dominguez said.</TE>
<TE>   For Maya, the damage is already done. Among the 35 people he laid
off were his daughter, who did his accounting, and his son, a recent
agricultural science graduate from Iowa State University.</TE>
<TE>   "NAFTA was a good idea, but, in the agricultural sector at least,
they didn't take into account all the advantages that one country had
over the other," Maya said. "I have dedicated my life to raising
hogs. I'm sorry to lose this life."</TE>

<HD>Hurricane Slams Into Mexico</HD>
<DH>About 40,000 people in a resort area flee ahead of the
140-mph storm, which injures 140 and causes millions of dollars in
damage.</DH>

<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>About 40,000 people fled their homes along Mexico's Pacific coast
north of Puerto Vallarta on Friday as Hurricane Kenna battered beach
areas, causing millions of dollars in damage and injuring at least
140 people.</LD>
<LD>   The hurricane developed rapidly over the eastern Pacific on
Thursday and took on potentially catastrophic dimensions. But it was
downgraded from Grade 5, the most severe, to Grade 4 early Friday.
Still, it was packing enough wallop -- with winds up to 140 mph --
that it prompted emergency alerts over a 200-mile stretch of
coastline.</LD>
<LD>   Kenna's northeasterly course meant that the storm's full brunt
missed the Puerto Vallarta resort area and steered clear of Cabo San
Lucas, in Baja California, where the leaders of Pacific Rim nations
are due to meet this morning at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum gathering hosted by Mexican President Vicente Fox.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, worries Kenna could develop into one of the most
powerful storms of the last half-century prompted the Mexican
government to prepare contingency plans to move the conference to an
undisclosed site.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, the storm didn't live up to its horrific potential.
Early Friday, Kenna passed over the Islas Marias, site of an infamous
Mexican prison, about 50 miles offshore. But it caused no injuries
among the 1,500 inmates, prison workers and family members and only
slight damage, federal officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Kenna then slammed into the coast of Nayarit state, lashing the
San Blas-Santiago Ixcuintla tourist and fishing area around 11 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   In nearby Puerto Vallarta, about 40 miles south of the point of
greatest impact, high winds, rain and waves crashing over seawalls
tore up streets, tossed cars around and broke windows along the
resort city's waterfront walkway, called the Malecon. Mayor Pedro
Ruiz Higuera said damage may reach $10 million, much of it suffered
by two major hotels.</TE>
<TE>   Although various officials remarked that rain and flood damage was
less than expected Friday, several roads into the beach areas were
closed for much of the afternoon, as was a 170-mile stretch of
Highway 15, a major thoroughfare that crosses Nayarit state.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Antonio Echevarria said in a telephone interview that the
port area of San Blas and the city of Santiago Ixcuintla apparently
sustained the greatest damage in his state. Telephone communication
to San Blas, a quiet tourist town favored by foreigners, was still
cut Friday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Nayarit appears to have been well prepared for the storm's high
winds and water, having opened 170 emergency shelters.</TE>
<TE>   "The assessment of the material losses and the number of homeless
will take several days to calculate, but until now we know of no
human losses, which is the most important," Echevarria said. He added
that rising waters in the San Pedro and Santiago rivers were the
greatest concern late Friday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Bracing for damage, and possible looting, the federal government
sent army troops to maintain public security and said special funds
would be made available from the federal budget for emergency and
reconstruction efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Homemaker Maria Elena Gonzalez Romero of Santiago Ixcuintla said
the winds were strong enough to strip trees bare and knock over the
brick walls of the local baseball stadium and preparatory school.</TE>
<TE>   "Many houses with thatched and corrugated roofs now have no
roofs," she said. "The trees on the central park look like the ants
have been at them. Only the trunks are left."</TE>
<TE>   Entire towns along the Nayarit coast, including Villa Juarez, Boca
de Camichin and El Sesteo were emptied of residents moving to
shelters.</TE>
<TE>   Echevarria's office said 80% of the people in Nayarit's beach
areas had been evacuated by Friday morning.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the 25,000 people evacuated in Nayarit, about
12,000 sought temporary shelter in Sinaloa state to the north, where
the major coastal city of Mazatlan had girded for the storm.</TE>
<TE>   Many local officials sought to reassure tourists, on whom the
economy is heavily dependent, that the zone would soon return to
normality.</TE>
<TE>   "Apart from the alarm and the prevention measures, Mazatlan passed
a normal day. None of the tourist infrastructure was damaged," said
Felipe Guerrero, spokesman for Mazatlan Mayor Gerardo Rosete Ramirez.</TE>
<TE>   After a visit of affected areas, Francisco Ramirez Acuna, governor
of Jalisco state, which includes Puerto Vallarta, said no deaths were
reported as of Friday afternoon. But he and Echevarria, the Nayarit
governor, issued appeals for donations of clothing and bottled water
for residents whose homes were damaged or destroyed.</TE>

<HD>In Retaliatory Move, Israel Clamps Down on a West Bank City</HD>
<DH>Troops and tanks roll into Jenin four days after a deadly
bus bombing. Several Palestinian gunmen are reported wounded.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Striking back in the wake of a suicide bombing four days earlier,
hundreds of Israeli troops backed by armor imposed a tight lockdown
Friday on Jenin, the West Bank city from which Israel said the
bombers came.</LD>
<LD>   Soldiers and dozens of tanks rumbled into Jenin before dawn,
residents and the army said, in what was described as the military's
largest incursion into the northern West Bank area in recent months.
Palestinians said six people were hurt, three of them seriously.</LD>
<LD>   The army said several Palestinian gunmen were wounded as they
fired at approaching troops.</LD>
<TE>   The drive into Jenin was triggered by Monday's bombing of a bus in
northern Israel in which 14 passengers were killed, the army said.
Some of the bombing victims burned to death when the bus was consumed
by flames within moments of being rammed by an explosives-laden SUV.
Scores of people were injured.</TE>
<TE>   Israel customarily responds militarily within hours to an attack
of such magnitude. In this case, it apparently waited for the
departure of an American envoy, Assistant Secretary of State William
Burns, who held talks with Israeli and Palestinian officials that
ended Thursday. Israel has been under strong pressure to exercise
restraint as the Bush administration gears up for a possible war in
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "As part of the war against terror ... infantry, armored and
engineering forces entered the city of Jenin, which is considered to
be a center of Palestinian terror infrastructure, and took positions
in the city," an Israeli army statement said.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli authorities blamed a cell of the radical group Islamic
Jihad for Monday's bombing, which came only days after a tight
military curfew in Jenin had been relaxed.</TE>
<TE>   Yasser Arafat, president of the Palestinian Authority, called the
Israeli incursion "a continuation of the crimes committed by troops
and [Jewish] settlers against our people and our children."</TE>
<TE>   Arafat is being cold-shouldered by the U.S. and Israel, which
consider him an architect of terrorist attacks against Israelis, and
Burns did not meet with him during his visit.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses in Jenin said the Israelis seized dozens of homes as
lookouts and sniper positions. Residents said the army appeared to
have encountered some resistance in a downtown area known as Sahel,
from which volleys of shots could be heard.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't even step outside my own door -- we were too
frightened to move," said 50-year-old resident Salem Mohammed Ghali,
a father of seven who was briefly interviewed by telephone. He said
that electricity had been cut and that loudspeaker announcements had
ordered people to stay inside.</TE>
<TE>   Tanks and armored military vehicles roared through the streets
throughout the day, Ghali and other residents said.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital officials said they hoped they had been able to tend to
all of those injured.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no idea what is going on in the city, as we cannot move
about and people cannot get to us," said Ziyad Abdel Nabi, the head
of the city's Al Razi hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The refugee camp adjoining Jenin was the scene of heavy fighting
in April when the Israeli army leveled a large swath of streets and
homes in the camp's center. A United Nations report later discounted
Palestinian claims that a massacre had occurred there.</TE>
<TE>   Jenin residents said Friday that they had stocked up on food and
candles in anticipation of another Israeli drive into the city.</TE>
<TE>   Jenin has long been a stronghold of Palestinian radical groups
that send attackers to strike at targets inside Israel. Israel's
easing of its hold on Jenin last week came amid Bush administration
criticism occasioned by the suffering in Palestinian areas caused by
tight curfews and by a sharp increase in civilian casualties during
Israeli army operations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Hours before the troops moved in, a boy was shot and killed after
he clambered atop an Israeli tank. Palestinians said the boy, who was
variously reported as being between 12 and 16 years of age, intended
his act as a nonviolent expression of defiance, but Israel said the
troops believed the boy intended to drop a bomb into the tank.</TE>

<HD>Cleric Linked to Al Qaeda Jailed</HD>
<DH>Abu Qatada, whose stature in Europe rivals that of Osama
bin Laden, is arrested in London 10 months after he disappeared.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sebastian Rotella and Janet Stobart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>British police have arrested Abu Qatada, a Muslim cleric whose angry
sermons and alleged ties to terrorists across Europe and beyond made
him one of the most revered and most wanted figures in Al Qaeda,
authorities said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The arrest took place Wednesday at a public housing project in
south London, according to authorities and the fugitive's friends.
The cleric, whose real name is Omar Mahmoud Othman, dropped out of
sight mysteriously in December as police were about to arrest him
under an anti-terrorism law passed in response to the Sept. 11
attacks on the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Police said nothing Friday about his whereabouts during the
subsequent 10 months or the circumstances of the arrest.</LD>
<TE>   It was a strange denouement for a strange case. Senior law
enforcement officials in other European nations had criticized the
British government for failing to arrest Abu Qatada sooner. In recent
months some European investigators speculated that British
intelligence agents had taken him into protective custody as an
informant.</TE>
<TE>   But there was little dispute Friday about the importance of the
catch.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's very significant: He is on the FBI most-wanted list,
he's wanted [in] France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Belgium for a
variety of terrorist conspiracies," said Andrew Dismore, a
parliamentary deputy. "He really is one of the spiders at the very
center of the web."</TE>
<TE>   Abu Qatada's stature in Europe rivals that of Osama bin Laden and
helped establish London as the hub of Al Qaeda activity outside
Afghanistan, European investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   Videocassettes of his sermons turned up in the Hamburg, Germany,
apartment of Sept. 11 hijacker Mohamed Atta. Would-be holy warriors
flocked to his Islamic center on Baker Street in London, where
extremists including Frenchman Zacarias Moussaoui, now facing trial
in the United States in connection with Sept. 11, were allegedly
radicalized.</TE>
<TE>   Spanish police call the Palestinian-born Abu Qatada a "godfather"
of a multiethnic federation of terrorism. He had close ties to a
Tunisian-dominated network in France and Belgium accused in the
assassination of anti-Taliban guerrilla chief Ahmed Shah Masoud in
Afghanistan; a Syrian group suspected of helping Sept. 11 suspects in
Germany and Spain; and an Algerian cell dismantled as it prepared a
Christmas attack on a cathedral in Strasbourg, France, in 2000,
according to investigators and court documents.</TE>
<TE>   "He was undoubtedly a top ideological leader," a Spanish police
official said Friday. "And we believe he was operationally very
important as well. Now the case against him on the second point must
be built. There are questions to answer."</TE>
<TE>   Among them are how the cleric was able to remain at large for so
long and what led to his capture.</TE>
<TE>   Two Islamic leaders who know Abu Qatada said he was captured after
his wife and children visited him at an apartment in a housing
project in south London across the River Thames from Parliament.
After the cleric's family had been with him four or five days,
British investigators intercepted a mobile-phone call by his wife and
pinpointed the hide-out, according to Omar Bakri of Al Muhajiron, a
prominent London extremist group.</TE>
<TE>   Another leader of Al Muhajiron, Anjem Choudary, said that Abu
Qatada had remained active while underground, communicating about
scholarly topics and imparting "Islamic guidance" over the Internet.
Choudary insisted that Abu Qatada simply managed to outwit his
pursuers for 10 months.</TE>
<TE>   "Abu Qatada is a very shrewd man," Choudary said. "There are many
people who could help him, and he could probably mingle with the
crowd without standing out. They were most probably monitoring his
wife and she let her guard slip."</TE>
<TE>   A different theory circulated among European law enforcement
officials and terrorism experts: that Britain's MI5 domestic
intelligence service knew Abu Qatada's location but decided that it
was valuable to keep him under surveillance. Their goal might have
been to monitor his communications and contacts and gather
information about suspected terrorists driven into the shadows by a
post-Sept. 11 crackdown, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a sneaking suspicion [authorities] knew where he was,"
said Magnus Ranstorp, an expert on terrorism at St. Andrews
University in Scotland. "A lot of people underestimate the capability
of MI5 and what they have achieved in the anti-terror war. They
operate below the visual radar."</TE>
<TE>   It is a trademark of elite counter-terrorism services in Britain,
France, Spain and Italy to conduct in-depth surveillance of prominent
suspects for as long as possible before detaining them.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesperson at London's Belmarsh Prison confirmed only that Abu
Qatada was arrested under the Terrorism Act and was being held under
heavy security.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Britain's top law enforcement official, Home Secretary
David Blunkett, told reporters that he did not know where the
fugitive cleric was.</TE>
<TE>   The tough law under which Abu Qatada was arrested was designed to
rein in Abu Qatada and others who allegedly used Islamic intellectual
activism to camouflage senior roles in the Al Qaeda terrorist
network. Especially because Al Qaeda has a limited hierarchy, the
cleric stood out as a dominant figure, experts say. A French police
intelligence report written in March 2001 described him as a
"theoretician of jihad."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators in several European countries allege that he ran the
human pipeline funneling recruits back and forth between London and
Afghan training camps and Islamic battle theaters. They also accuse
him of helping to finance and direct terrorist plots in cahoots with
Bin Laden's brain trust in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Qatada was born in Bethlehem in 1960 and moved to Jordan. He
arrived in Britain in 1993 and received political asylum. He was
sentenced to life imprisonment in Jordan in absentia for his alleged
involvement in terrorist attacks. But he cannot be deported because
Jordan has a death penalty and Britain does not extradite suspects to
countries that have capital punishment.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s, he was active in the London leadership of the
Armed Islamic Group, or GIA, which waged a bloody struggle against
the Algerian government and carried out attacks in France, according
to Italian and French court documents. He was the editor of GIA's
newspaper and played a role in absorbing Algerian terrorists into Al
Qaeda, which was then an evolving alliance of extremist networks,
according to the French intelligence report.</TE>
<TE>   This week's arrest was not his first. He was arrested by British
police in February 2001 during a follow-up investigation of the
alleged Strasbourg plot, but he was soon released, according to
Italian court documents.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, the U.S. placed him on a list of suspects who
allegedly provided material support for acts of terrorism. Britain
froze his assets.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Qatada has denied any role in violence, describing himself as
a man of faith and ideas. British officials must now assess their
case against him while anticipating extradition requests from half a
dozen other countries eager to prosecute him.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a sticky dilemma for the British government," Ranstorp
said.</TE>

<HD>Hussein Throws a Sop to Bad Students</HD>
<DH>In his latest bid for more public support, the Iraqi leader
gives pupils who have failed at school another chance at an
education.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Slackman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>Trying to increase public support for his regime, President Saddam
Hussein is doling out what he calls rewards to his people, most
recently with a decision Friday to allow students who have failed
school to return to their studies.</LD>
<LD>   Even suggesting a lack of fidelity to the leader could result in
serious punishment in Iraq. It comes as no surprise that everyone
responds to questions about the president as did Ehab Rafe, 29, an
electronics shop owner. "We are all with our president," he said.</LD>
<LD>   Nevertheless, when authorities announced that Hussein
had overruled another law for the benefit of ordinary Iraqis, the
moved was widely viewed as an attempt to win public favor. "The
leadership is trying to get popular support," said Suad Mohammed, 56,
a high school English teacher.</LD>
<TE>   The Iraqi government is feeling threatened, not only from
the United States but also from within its own borders. Though the
regime, relying on its network of police and security services,
remains firmly in control, there is concern that pressure from
America could inspire an opposition. To help shore up his position,
analysts and diplomats say, Hussein has been trying to present
himself as a benevolent, if authoritarian, leader.</TE>
<TE>   The official line, published in the newspaper Al Iraq newspaper --
which is owned and operated by the government -- is that Hussein
wants to reward his people for their unparalleled show of allegiance.</TE>
<TE>   The government held a referendum last week on Hussein's
leadership, and the regime said that every single one of the nearly
11.5 million votes cast was in support of the president.</TE>
<TE>   "Within the framework of the reward of the president to his loyal
people, his excellency ordered students who don't have the chance to
restart their studies to have the chance again," the newspaper
reported with a banner headline across its front page Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who fails the same grade a total of three times in Iraq's
troubled school system is thrown out. Success or failure in school
can have a direct bearing on how long a young man must serve in the
military. University graduates serve about half the time of dropouts,
who are committed to three years in the army.</TE>
<TE>   But this nation's interest in education has waned in recent years
as young people have left their studies so they can work to help feed
their families. It is questionable whether many young people will now
return to their studies.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein first hinted that he might try to soften his image at home
in a speech he made after the referendum on another seven-year term.
The speech was typically full of attacks against the United States
and Israel.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of firing a weapon in the air, as he often does when
appearing before audiences, the man who has ruled this country with
an iron fist for two decades tried to present himself as sensitive to
the needs of the people.</TE>
<TE>   "I shall not close the door of forgiveness before any sincere
penitence to Allah and any willingness to renounce everything
harmful," he said toward the end of his speech.</TE>
<TE>   Not long after the speech, Hussein issued a decree freeing almost
every criminal and political prisoner in the nation's vast detention
system -- except those accused of spying for America or Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The exodus of thousands of prisoners was greeted here as a "gift,"
especially to the families of those who were locked away.</TE>
<TE>   But the nice guy image was clouded when it became clear that many
prisoners who had been taken away over the years would never return.
Family members who showed up at government offices asking for
information were forced to disperse.</TE>
<TE>   The leadership announced this week that there is also a plan in
the works to eliminate a tax on all travelers who want to leave the
country. The plan is to do away with the fee of 400,000 dinars, or
about $200, that every Iraqi must pay to customs officers when going
abroad.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal has reportedly been approved by the Cabinet and
recommended to the Revolutionary Command Council, which is virtually
certain to go along.</TE>
<TE>   The government will still discourage people of draft age or those
already serving in the military from crossing the border. But others,
particularly people doing business in neighboring Jordan, stand to
save a lot of money by Iraqi standards.</TE>
<TE>   For most people, who barely have enough money to get by, the
change would have no immediate effect. But the plan has been widely
perceived as a nice gesture by the president.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an excellent thing," said Hussein Shadidi, 56, a retired
military officer who said he could not afford to travel. "It is more
liberty and freedom for citizens."</TE>

<HD>Extremist Held in Fatal Stabbing of Japanese Politico</HD>
<DH>As nation reels from attack in upscale Tokyo district,
authorities reportedly say suspect had quarreled with lawmaker over
money.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Magnier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>A member of a right-wing extremist group was taken into custody in
the stabbing death of an opposition lawmaker in front of his house,
Japanese media reported today. The attack sent shock waves through a
nation where violence against leaders is rare.</LD>
<LD>   Broadcaster NHK said the man was in custody. Kyodo News, citing
investigators, said the man had quarreled with the victim several
times over money at the lawmaker's office. Police declined to
comment.</LD>
<LD>   Koki Ishii, 61, a member of the House of Representatives, was
leaving his house around 10:40 a.m. Friday when he was stabbed in the
stomach by an assailant wielding a 12-inch blade.</LD>
<TE>   Although such high-profile crimes in other countries tend to
involve firearms, strict gun control in Japan means that a sword or
knife is traditionally the weapon of choice.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said the attacker was in his 50s, dressed like a
security guard and wearing a red bandanna. A kitchen knife was found
on the road after the man fled. Ishii was rushed to a hospital and
died about noon. Police initially said they had no suspects and few
leads.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii was about to join his political secretary and his driver in
a car when he was attacked. Neighbors later said a man had been seen
lurking around the neighborhood for about two hours before the
attack, and added that they had heard Ishii shout at someone and then
scream.</TE>
<TE>   When she heard him scream, Ishii's wife ran out of the house,
calling for help and frantically bemoaning the tardiness of an
ambulance.</TE>
<TE>   Police swarmed the neighborhood in Setagaya, an upscale part of
Tokyo, amid widespread speculation about a motive.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic Party member was known for his vocal battles
against corruption and injustice.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii investigated the Aum Supreme Truth cult after the group
mounted a sarin gas attack in 1995 on riders in the Tokyo subway. He
also launched probes into the industrial waste sector and others with
close ties to yakuza, or organized crime figures, linking them to the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii and two other aggressive colleagues in his party were dubbed
the "three crows of pursuit." Ishii was also known for pursuing
reforms and for verbally attacking corrupt lawmakers and condemning
in parliament the waste of taxpayer money.</TE>
<TE>   "He frequently offended enemies," said Harumi Arima, an
independent political analyst. "We don't know anything for sure yet,
but there seem to be several possible motives."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii had also taken on social issues since winning a seat in
parliament in 1993. One of the most high-profile was a campaign in
2000 against the Japanese film "Battle Royale," which depicted a
future society in Japan where violence has run amok.</TE>
<TE>   Politicians, analysts and social critics quickly condemned Ishii's
slaying.</TE>
<TE>   "Political activity should in no way be hindered by violence,"
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi told reporters a few hours after
Ishii died. "I feel very angry."</TE>
<TE>   Japanese politicians are rarely the object of violence, but those
cases that do occur have tended to involve right-wing extremists. The
last time a standing member of parliament was assassinated for
political reasons reportedly was in 1960, when Socialist Party leader
Inejiro Asanuma was stabbed by a right-wing youngster at a rally.</TE>
<TE>   Arima said Japanese society has become increasingly heartless and
doesn't seem to work well anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really shocked," said Miki Watanabe, 31, a homemaker living
in Tokyo. "I really don't feel safe. In Japan, you always assumed
water and safety were free. Now that all seems to have changed."</TE>
<TE>   Bunri Tatsuno, associate professor of criminology at Tokiwa
University, said Japanese are increasingly fearful of becoming
victims of crime as the social glue weakens. A single high-profile
killing like this one, he added, can undermine people's trust in
society.</TE>
<TE>   "Even one crime can have a big impact on people," Tatsuno said.
Increasing petty problems are diverting police from more important
crimes, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii graduated from Waseda University and studied at Moscow
University. He is survived by his 57-year-old wife, Natasha, a
Russian, and his daughter, Hitomi.</TE>

<HD>France, Russia Offer New Iraq Texts at U.N.</HD>
<DH>Envoys suggest drafts by Paris and Moscow could advance,
not set back, effort on a resolution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maggie Farley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>France and Russia each offered their own compromise proposals to the
United Nations on Friday to counter a tough U.S. resolution on Iraq
that they say opens the door to war on Baghdad without the approval
of the Security Council.</LD>
<LD>   The surprise move by two of the five veto-holding council members
gave sharp, new focus to a dispute over Iraq that has dragged on for
weeks. But some diplomats said it might lead to agreement by clearly
defining the remaining differences.</LD>
<LD>   The United States said that it was willing to discuss compromises.
However, it declared that a new resolution must have tough
consequences for Iraq and insisted that a vote be held next week.</LD>
<TE>   The proposals by France and Russia focused on what the two
countries called "hidden triggers" in the U.S. draft resolution --
ambiguous terms that could be used to initiate military action
against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   They and other council members also objected to several strict
requirements in the U.S. proposal that, if Iraq failed to meet them,
could provide grounds for an attack.</TE>
<TE>   "The real hidden trigger is not to have a resolution," Richard
Grenell, spokesman for the U.S. mission to the United Nations, said
in response.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has said that if the U.N. fails to take action
against Iraq, the U.S. will assemble a coalition of allies to act on
their own.</TE>
<TE>   "We're caught in the cross-fire," said Mexican Ambassador Adolfo
Aguilar Zinser, who holds an important swing vote. "We have to be
careful we don't create conditions to go to war that will backfire on
the U.N. The challenge is to find the balance between responding to
violations of U.N. resolutions while upholding international law."</TE>
<TE>   Both of the new proposals leave out the U.S. charge that Iraq
already is in "material breach" of several Security Council
resolutions, a term that can be used to justify military action that
U.S. officials have insisted be in any new U.N. resolution.</TE>
<TE>   The French draft retains the threat of "serious consequences" if
Iraq fails to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors, but it makes
clear that the Security Council should decide how to respond to Iraqi
noncompliance. The Russian proposal contained neither term and also
retained restrictions on the inspection of Iraq's so-called
presidential sites.</TE>
<TE>   Diplomats said that instead of setting back agreement on a
resolution, the new drafts could help because they concretely define
objections and alternatives to the U.S. text.</TE>
<TE>   While the French are presenting their draft as a serious
alternative, the Russians seemed to offer theirs as a set of ideas,
and didn't explain the text in detail to council members during the
meeting, as the French and Americans did theirs.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. official said that despite Russia's bluster in the last few
days, the U.S. believes it will reach agreement with the Russians,
noting that Secretary of State Colin L. Powell had "a good
discussion" with Russian Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov on Thursday
at a meeting in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "They are working with us to get a resolution, and they are
working with us off our draft," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   After a closed-door daylong debate Friday, the 15 members of the
council agreed that they should seek consensus on a single
resolution. But they remained divided on what it should say.</TE>
<TE>   "Iraq has not complied with relevant U.N. resolutions -- on that
we agree," said Bulgarian Ambassador Stefan Tavrov after the council
adjourned. "The whole question is what the consequences should be and
how we should phrase it. I think we can find a solution where there
is no ambiguity on this."</TE>
<TE>   The French think that their proposal, which requires the Security
Council to convene before authorizing an attack on Iraq, has the
backing of a majority of the Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   To be adopted, a resolution needs nine votes and no vetoes from
the five permanent members -- France, Britain, China, Russia and the
U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good day for us," said a French diplomat, who counted
Russia, China, Mexico, Mauritius, Ireland, Guinea and Cameroon as
supporters. Syria, the lone Arab voice on the council, is expected to
vote against the measure or abstain.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has agreed to consult with the council if Iraq obstructs
weapons inspections or violates other terms of the resolution. But
after six weeks of negotiations on the first resolution, the U.S. is
wary of being embroiled in debate on a second, and insists it would
not have to wait for its approval to strike.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. believes that Britain, Colombia, Norway, Bulgaria and
perhaps Singapore share its view and that more states will swing its
way in the coming days.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not counting votes," said Deputy U.S. Ambassador James B.
Cunningham. "You never know how people are going to vote until voting
time comes."</TE>
<TE>   Rather than twisting arms, U.S. diplomats said they were listening
Friday, taking notes on each ambassador's suggestions to discuss over
the weekend in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll figure out which suggestions strengthen the resolution, and
which ones don't," said a U.S. official.</TE>
<TE>   But privately, Bush administration officials said their bottom
line was clear.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to continue to work until next Friday -- and if we
don't get a resolution by then, the council of chieftains will meet"
in Washington, said a senior U.S. official, referring to Bush's top
advisors. He said that including the term "material breach" was
nonnegotiable and that the conditions for Iraq would remain
stringent.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. resolution requires that Iraq accept the resolution
within seven days, and make a full accounting of all materials for
weapons of mass destruction within 30 days. If it doesn't make an
accounting, if it blocks inspectors or if it leaves anything off the
list that is found later, Iraq would be in violation of the
resolution.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hard core on these issues," the official said, adding that
the administration was willing to see a few countries abstain on the
Security Council vote, "though it's not the preferred option."</TE>
<TE>   Others at the U.N. fear that several abstentions would send a
message to Iraq that the council was wavering on upholding its own
demands. Abstentions by Russia, France, China and Malaysia on the
1999 resolution that created a new team of U.N. weapons inspectors
gave Iraq little incentive to cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to strengthen our hands without tying our feet," said
Chinese Ambassador Wang Yingfan, who added that it was too early to
decide whether Beijing would abstain again.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, we need to have very effective inspections because
this is an issue of peace and war. But we do not wish to have a
resolution that gives authorization of military action, and we do not
wish to have any ambiguities that can be interpreted as giving the
authorization already."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the Council will meet with chief U.N. weapons inspector
Hans Blix and with Mohammed Baradei, director of the International
Atomic Energy Agency, to determine what their inspectors need to do
their job well.</TE>
<TE>   "After that, I think we'll be in a good position to look at how we
get forward to come to conclusion on the resolution next week," said
Cunningham, the deputy U.S. ambassador.</TE>

<HD>Texas Summit: Short, Relaxed</HD>
<DH>China's Jiang vows to help stop North Korea's arms program.
But he's less supportive on Iraq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maura Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CRAWFORD, Texas</DL>
<LD>Chinese leader Jiang Zemin, making what is believed to be a
valedictory visit to President Bush at his Texas ranch, pledged
support Friday for diplomatic efforts to end North Korea's nuclear
weapons program but appeared to elude pressure to back U.S. policies
on Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   The short, relaxed summit meeting, designed to help seal Jiang's
legacy as a statesman after 13 years in power, came as China finds
itself in a position to assist or block Bush's two main foreign
objectives: shutting down the nuclear potentials of Iraq and North
Korea.</LD>
<LD>   In brief remarks to reporters, Jiang claimed that North Korea's
recent admission that it has continued to pursue a program to enrich
uranium caught the Chinese off guard.</LD>
<TE>   "We were completely in the dark as for the recent developments,"
Jiang said. "But today, President Bush and I agreed the problem
should be resolved peacefully."</TE>
<TE>   He pledged to consult with the United States and other countries
to develop a common strategy but stopped short of promising to use
China's considerable economic and political influence to pressure the
North Koreans.</TE>
<TE>   A senior Bush administration official said the apparent lack of
progress was not discouraging.</TE>
<TE>   "We are at the beginning of a campaign to mobilize the world
against this program, and I think we are making good progress," said
the official, who requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   On Iraq, Bush said he had made his case to Jiang that any new U.N.
resolution must include "consequences" in the event of a failure by
Baghdad to comply with demands that it eliminate any biological,
chemical or nuclear weapons. Bush's remarks made clear that China had
made no commitments on that score.</TE>
<TE>   "Today we discussed, and I urged President Jiang to support, a new
Security Council resolution demanding Iraq fully disarm itself of
weapons of mass destruction," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   The senior administration official said the Chinese reiterated
their position that Iraq must comply fully with all current U.N.
resolutions. However, the official added, they did not go beyond that
to indicate how they might vote in the Security Council either on a
U.S.-proposed resolution or on a new, milder resolution proposed
Friday by Russia and France.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have common ground on which to work," the official
said. "I'm not going to characterize where I think the Chinese will
wind up on this issue finally."</TE>
<TE>   Jiang's visit to Crawford was chilled -- literally -- by
low-hanging clouds and occasional drizzle. Bush, who is famously
punctual, paced his front porch while he waited for the Chinese
leader to arrive. At one point, he looked pointedly at his watch and
then joked to reporters: "We could be fishing."</TE>
<TE>   The previous day, Bush had told campaign audiences that Laura Bush
was already in Crawford, preparing for Jiang's visit by "sweeping the
porch." Asked Friday if she appreciated the remark, the first lady
shook her head and mouthed, "No."</TE>
<TE>   Jiang's motorcade pulled up to the ranch half an hour behind
schedule. Jiang, 76, was accompanied by his wife, Wang Yeping, also
in her mid-70s, who walked unsteadily and appeared to cling to Bush's
arm as he accompanied her into the stone house.</TE>
<TE>   It was the leaders' third meeting, and the senior official said
their level of comfort has grown.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the most positive meeting between the two leaders," the
official said.</TE>
<TE>   Jiang is expected to step down next month as Chinese leader,
although he is likely to retain several secondary titles that will
allow him to remain active in the leadership. His tour of the U.S.,
which included visits to Chicago and a dinner with former President
George H.W. Bush in Houston, has been seen as a kind of farewell
visit.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. side mentioned Jiang's apparent impending retirement
during the session, earning a wry and cryptic response from the
Chinese leader.</TE>
<TE>   "Ah, yes, many people are talking about that," Jiang said,
according to the administration official. "He said there are many
rumors floating around" about his future status and plans.</TE>
<TE>   Jiang has taken credit over the last year for improving U.S.-China
relations, considered steady and cordial now after a near-breach
caused by the collision of a Chinese military jet and a U.S. spy
plane almost 19 months ago.</TE>
<TE>   All the same, the U.S. stopped short Friday of making moves, which
China is seeking as signs of improved relations, toward renewing
commercial satellite launches on Chinese rockets and
military-to-military contacts.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said he encouraged Jiang to improve human rights in China.</TE>
<TE>   "I emphasized that no nation's efforts to counter terrorism should
be used to justify suppressing minorities or silencing peaceful
dissent," he said. "I shared with the president my views on the
importance of China freeing prisoners of conscience, giving fair
treatment to peoples of faith and preserving the rights of Hong Kong
citizens."</TE>

<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>MOSCOW -- She was the first person slain by the Chechen rebels who
seized hostages at a Moscow theater this week, and the 26-year-old
perfume-shop clerk did not even have to be there.</LD>
<LD>   Olga Romanova was always moved to action by her innate sense of
justice, according to her family, who say that early Thursday, she
went on a one-person mission to persuade the hostage-takers to free
their estimated 700 captives.</LD>
<LD>   Whether courageous or foolhardy, her attempt ended in her death
when the Chechens decided she was a police spy.</LD>
<TE>   Romanova was adamant that she had to try to do something to assist
the theatergoers and performers captured Wednesday night during a
performance of the Russian musical "Nord-Ost," said her mother,
Antonina.</TE>
<TE>   Romanova set out from home at 3:30 a.m. Somehow, probably because
she lived in the neighborhood and knew it well, she made it to the
theater unnoticed by police, who had hastily put up a cordon around
the Soviet-era House of Culture in southeast Moscow, where the show
was being staged.</TE>
<TE>   "I told her not to go. I begged and I cried," the mother said. "I
did everything to stop her, because I thought going there was sheer
madness. But everything was in vain.</TE>
<TE>   "She had confidence in her power of persuasion, and she believed
she could talk the terrorists into releasing the hostages -- if not
all of them, then at least the women and children."</TE>
<TE>   The older woman cried throughout an interview Friday, hours before
Russian security forces stormed the theater and ended the crisis. She
said she did not know what had happened until she watched television
Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   "They gave a verbal description of the corpse. As soon as I heard
the first words, I told my husband: 'Nikolai, they are talking about
our Olga! It's definitely her!'</TE>
<TE>   "It's a horrible tragedy for us," she said. "We have lost our
Olechka!"</TE>
<TE>   A communique issued by the pro-Chechen information agency the
Kavkaz Center gave the hostage-takers' version of Romanova's fate.
The agency said it had been contacted by people linked to the
hostage-takers immediately after the killing. Rebels have been
battling Russian troops in the separatist republic of Chechnya for
years.</TE>
<TE>   "At approximately 4 a.m. -- a young woman entered into the
building of the House of Culture despite the fact that she was warned
not to enter," it said. "The young woman impudently entered the hall,
declaring, 'And what can you do to me?' " the agency asserted. She
was warned to leave but did not react, it said.</TE>
<TE>   The communique went on: "Having information about the tactics of
the FSB [the Russian security police], moujahedeen understood that
the woman entered for the purpose of collecting information.
Considering the seriousness of the prevailing situation, it was
decided to shoot the young woman."</TE>
<TE>   If they thought Romanova was any danger or a police spy, the
hostage-takers could not have been more mistaken, her mother said.
"Olga died because she had a very kind heart," she said. "She was
someone who cried her eyes out when her cat died in an accident. One
of her main traits was that she would feel righteous indignation
about any manifestation of injustice.</TE>
<TE>   "She could not stand when people were mistreated, and this is what
I think drove her out of our apartment that night," the mother added.
"Olga told me that she wanted to go talk to the terrorists and tell
them that holding so many innocent people, including women and
children, was a wrong thing. She was absolutely certain that she
would be able to convince them."</TE>
<TE>   Romanova, who was not married and lived with her parents, could
also be highly persuasive, her mother said.</TE>
<TE>   "She had this magic power of being able to convince anybody.
Everybody who worked with her liked and respected her. She did not
have enemies, only friends."</TE>
<TE>   Getting ready to go to the police and identify Romanova's body,
the mother had difficulty believing what had happened.</TE>
<TE>   "I had never felt the war in Chechnya was a just cause. I have
always thought that it was pretty meaningless," she said. "It only
claimed the lives of young people and helped the rich get richer.
Starting this war was a big mistake from the very start.</TE>
<TE>   "On the other hand, Chechen rebels also bear a responsibility for
waging this war. And in any case, why should innocent and peaceful
people like us pay such a price? We have not even seen a gun in our
lives, let alone fired one. My daughter was killed for nothing. It
was so utterly meaningless!"</TE>

<HD>Lawyers Who Sue to Settle</HD>
<DH>Filing hundreds of cases citing consumer laws' fine print,
they rarely go to trial but collect thousands from badgered
businesses.</DH>

<AU>Monte Morin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They've sued bowling alleys, alleging that "ladies night" discounts
are unfair to men.</LD>
<LD>   They've sued software manufacturers on the ground that their bulky
packaging tricks consumers into thinking they're getting more than a
small computer disk.</LD>
<LD>   They've sued makers of herbal remedies, contending that tiny
bottles of extract are alcoholic beverages potentially harmful to
unborn babies.</LD>
<TE>   A small band of litigators has struck gold in the fine print of
laws intended to protect Californians from hazardous chemicals,
discrimination and business scams.</TE>
<TE>   They blanket the business world with hundreds of lawsuits at a
time, often making claims that appear fanciful, even absurd. Most of
the cases never get to trial. The lawyers make their money on
settlements paid by defendants who just want to make the suits go
away. The amounts typically are modest -- from $2,000 to $50,000 --
but they add up.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles attorney Morse Mehrban helped pioneer this form of
litigation. He describes himself as a "bounty hunter," and his prey
consists of hotel owners, dentists and purveyors of aromatic oils,
medical implants and many other products.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my job to go out there and hunt these people down," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A group of Los Angeles-area hardware stores paid Mehrban $27,500
last year to settle a lawsuit claiming that discarded metal filings
from key-duplicating machines posed a threat of lead contamination.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Mehrban filed 400 separate claims against
makers of candles, charging that the common table ornaments emit
toxic fumes. He's currently in court with more than a dozen
manufacturers and retailers of artificial fireplace logs, which he
claims emit toxic fumes when lit.</TE>
<TE>   He once sued dozens of hotel chains that allegedly had failed to
post warnings about the hazards of cigarette smoke in lobby and pool
areas. A Los Angeles judge who dismissed one of the cases -- against
the Miramar Sheraton -- likened the lawsuit to "racketeering."</TE>
<TE>   Such criticism does not faze Mehrban. Though he bills his time at
as much as $400 an hour and drives a Mercedes roadster, he says he's
not in it for the money.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always been interested in leveling the playing field for
everyone, especially the little guy," he said. "I take it as a
personal affront when I see injustice done to people.... That sense
of injustice becomes your internal fuel. That's what drives me."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the cases filed by Mehrban and other lawyers in this
specialty involve Proposition 65. The law, approved by California
voters in 1986, requires businesses to warn the public about products
or activities that cause exposure to hazardous chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 65 is responsible for the signs seen at entrances to
office buildings, parking structures and other public places stating
that "Products Sold or Used on These Premises May Contain Chemicals
Known to the State of California to Cause Cancer or Birth Defects."</TE>
<TE>   The law allows private individuals to sue companies that fail to
comply. The plaintiffs need not have suffered any personal harm.
Businesses shown to have broken the law can be ordered to pay the
plaintiffs' legal fees. Nonprofit consumer groups that bring suits
can also collect fines from the defendants and use the money to fund
future lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   The number of Prop. 65 suits has increased from 50 in 1988 to more
than 5,000 last year. Many are filed on behalf of nonprofit groups;
some of these bill themselves as independent organizations but are
closely tied to the lawyers filing the suits. Mehrban frequently sues
on behalf of a nonprofit of which his mother and fiancee are
officers.</TE>
<TE>   Such suits typically target hundreds, occasionally thousands, of
businesses at a time.</TE>
<TE>   "It's as if someone has gone to a catalog or to the Internet to
find as many people as they can" to sue, said Ed Weil, a deputy state
attorney general involved in a crackdown on frivolous Proposition 65
cases.</TE>
<TE>   Weil said the mass lawsuits can be lucrative, even if individual
settlements are modest. "If you get 400 companies to give you $2,500
each, then you've got $1 million," he said.</TE>
<TE>   'Why Create Us?'</TE>
<TE>   Handsome and trim, the 33-year-old Mehrban wears a light beard and
a serious expression. Despite the fancy car, he claims to live the
modest life of a consumer advocate. If he wanted to make a fortune,
he said, he'd work for corporations instead of suing them.</TE>
<TE>   He lives in a Brentwood condominium. "You know how much it costs
to buy a home here?" he asked. "More than I can afford."</TE>
<TE>   His office is on a side street in Koreatown, on the second floor
of a converted Craftsman house with peeling yellow paint. A poster of
the Al Pacino film "The Devil's Advocate" hangs above a sofa. He
knows the title sums up how many of his targets view him. He says
their ire is misdirected.</TE>
<TE>   "The people of California voted to approve Proposition
65," Mehrban said. "We are the manifestation of the people's will. It's
like Frankenstein's monster. If you didn't want us, why did you
create us?"</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates who have worked with Mehrban say his commitment
to "the little guy" is genuine.</TE>
<TE>   "Morse really throws himself into these cases and works into
the wee hours of the morning," said Stephen Barrett, a retired
psychiatrist and vice president of the National Council Against
Health Fraud, a group Mehrban represented in suits challenging the
effectiveness of homeopathic remedies. "I've seen him work to the
point of exhaustion, and I think he does it out of dedication."</TE>
<TE>   Mehrban was born in Iran to a Jewish family that immigrated to the
United States in 1981. The family lived in New York before moving to
Los Angeles. Mehrban said the memory of the religious persecution his
family had suffered in Iran motivated him to pursue a legal career.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from Southwestern University School of Law
in 1993, Mehrban went into practice with two recent law school
graduates. The partners saw in Proposition 65 a new avenue for civil
litigation that would be both socially progressive and lucrative.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to requiring the warnings to the public about
hazardous chemicals, the law requires the governor to publish and
update annually a list of chemicals known to cause cancer, birth
defects or other reproductive harm. The list currently contains more
than 700 chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   Mehrban and his partners searched libraries and the Internet to
identify products that contained the listed substances. Then they
sued scores of businesses at a time, contending that the businesses'
products were hazardous and required warnings.</TE>
<TE>   They and other attorneys also developed cases under the state's
Unfair Competition Act, which forbids such practices as false
advertising and price-fixing. Like Proposition 65, the act permits
people to sue businesses even if the plaintiffs have not been
personally victimized by such conduct.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, Mehrban went into practice on his own. In 1997, he sued
Aroma Vera, a Los Angeles manufacturer of aromatherapy products,
because an oil that was supposed to improve brain power had failed to
work on Mehrban's mother. The manufacturer settled for $5,700 and
agreed to stop making certain claims about its products.</TE>
<TE>   The following year, Mehrban sued a kosher market in Los Angeles'
Pico-Robertson district for selling imported cigars that didn't have
the U.S. Surgeon General's warning about the harmful effects of
smoking. The case was settled for an undisclosed sum.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiff in many of Mehrban's suits is Consumer Cause Inc.,
which describes itself as a statewide advocacy group. Its mailing
address is the Brentwood home of Mehrban's mother, Rafat Efraim, who
for a time was listed on state incorporation records as the group's
only officer. According to Mehrban, Consumer Cause now has five
officers, including his mother and fiancee. He declined to identify
the other officers.</TE>
<TE>   When Mehrban settles a Consumer Cause case, the defendant pays his
fee directly. Mehrban charges as much as $400 an hour for
representing the nonprofit. In some cases, defendants also pay
monetary "penalties" called for by Proposition 65. Consumer Cause
collects these payments. In documents filed with the state, the group
says it uses the money for "further Proposition 65 enforcement."</TE>
<TE>   In the aromatherapy case, the manufacturer's lawyer called
Mehrban's mother to the witness stand during a pretrial hearing in an
effort to show that Consumer Cause was a mere front for Mehrban's
legal practice.</TE>
<TE>   Efraim speaks only Farsi and testified through an interpreter.
Asked the name of the consumer group, she replied: "Help the
customers." Efraim said she did not know whether it had any other
officers.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Pinsky, who represented Aroma Vera, later called Consumer
Cause "an utter charade." Mehrban says the organization serves a
valuable purpose, acting as a check on the "corporate establishment."</TE>
<TE>   Mehrban's methods often stir outrage, and not only among his legal
adversaries. In the case involving a hotel chain that he had accused
of failing to post warnings about the hazards of cigarette smoke, a
Los Angeles judge was biting in his description of the lawyer's
tactics.</TE>
<TE>   After a hearing at which he peppered Mehrban with questions about
the case and where money from a settlement would go, Superior Court
Judge Brett C. Klein dismissed the suit. Noting that Proposition 65
lawsuits can be brought only "in the public interest," Klein said:
"This case is brought in the private interest, not in the public
interest."</TE>
<TE>   "There are many nouns that one might attempt to use,
metaphorically, to describe what this case is about," the judge said.
"The most appropriate metaphorical term would be 'racketeering.' "</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Mehrban and Consumer Cause filed suit against 34 food
and herbal supplement manufacturers, contending that they had failed
to warn consumers that vitamin supplements and cooking ingredients
contained alcohol. Proposition 65 requires that alcoholic beverages
bear labels warning that they can be harmful to pregnant women.</TE>
<TE>   The supplement companies said that the recommended doses for their
products are so small -- measured with a teaspoon or eye dropper --
that someone would have to consume several bottles in one sitting to
ingest enough alcohol to harm an unborn baby.</TE>
<TE>   A judge dismissed the suit, saying it was "absurd" to contend that
such products require a Proposition 65 warning. But the companies
didn't walk away feeling like winners. Their attorney says their
legal fees were more than $200,000.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, a state appeals court strengthened the hand of
plaintiffs in Proposition 65 cases. The ruling came in a Consumer
Cause lawsuit against a chain of dentists' offices. In the suit,
Mehrban contended that the mercury in silver fillings could cause
birth defects and diseases. The dentists responded that the amounts
were so small that there was no risk to patients.</TE>
<TE>   In a 2-1 decision, a panel of the Second District Court of Appeals
held that, when a company makes such an argument in a Proposition 65
case, it bears the burden of proving that the chemical is not
dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Miriam Vogel said the ruling put
businesses at a legal disadvantage and could lead to "judicial
extortion."</TE>
<TE>   "What's a doctor or dentist to do?" Vogel wrote. "Settle with the
plaintiff, of course.... Save the legal fees. Get rid of the case."</TE>
<TE>   The court sent Mehrban's suit back to a lower court, which ordered
the two sides into mediation. The dentists have agreed to pay Mehrban
$20,000 in legal fees, according to their attorney, Randall Sherman.</TE>
<TE>   "They are not happy about having to pay any money ... for a case
without merit," Sherman said.</TE>
<TE>   In another recent Proposition 65 case, Mehrban negotiated a
$60,000 settlement with several makers of medical implants,
orthodontic devices and penile implants. The lawsuit alleged that the
companies, including Johnson &amp; Johnson, had failed to warn customers
about the presence of nickel in their products.</TE>
<TE>   The companies insist that the concentrations of nickel are so
small that they posed no hazard. They said they settled to avoid a
trial with its huge legal bills.</TE>
<TE>   What Consumer Cause wanted "was to do enough work on the case to
get it to trial and no more," said Jeffrey Marguilies, a lawyer for
the implant makers. "Once they did that, the burden would be on us to
prove that we don't have to post warnings. We could have been talking
multiple millions in defense costs if we went to trial."</TE>
<TE>   State Review</TE>
<TE>   Responding to complaints from businesses, the state attorney
general's office this year began reviewing Proposition 65 suits in an
attempt to deter frivolous ones.</TE>
<TE>   The law requires a plaintiff, before filing a suit, to submit a
"certificate of merit," with the attorney general briefly laying out
the factual basis for the case. The attorney general's office cannot
throw out a lawsuit, but if it finds that a case lacks substance, the
opinion holds great weight with judges, according to plaintiff's
attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, the attorney general has identified more than
4,000 cases statewide as lacking scientific foundation or sufficient
evidence of wrongdoing. They include nearly 400 of Mehrban's cases,
most involving claims that table candles emit toxic fumes and should
bear warning labels.</TE>
<TE>   Mehrban vows to take some of those suits to court anyway. But he's
also diversifying. On behalf of the National Coalition of Free Men,
he filed suit last month against Los Angeles County, contending that
it practices discrimination by funding a commission on women's issues
while doing nothing comparable for men.</TE>
<TE>   He's also researching lawsuits against bars and restaurants that
offer "ladies' discounts."</TE>
<TE>   He professes to see these cases, too, as a battle between right
and wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "I have nothing against women. I love them to death. But when you
have to pay more for something because of your gender, that's
illegal," Mehrban said. "Men encounter discrimination every day, and
I think it's a basic civil rights issue."</TE>

<DH>New law on battered women's syndrome brings release after
Davis denied parole.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anna Gorman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An abused woman who has served almost two decades in state prison for
killing her husband was released from custody Friday by a Los Angeles
Superior Court judge who ruled that the outcome of her 1985 trial
would likely have been different if evidence of battered women's
syndrome had been allowed in her defense.</LD>
<LD>   Marva Wallace, 44, a mother of two, is believed to be the first
inmate released under a new California law that allows inmates to
file habeas corpus petitions in cases in which evidence of battered
women's syndrome was not permitted at trial.</LD>
<LD>   Two weeks ago, Gov. Gray Davis denied Wallace parole, reversing a
recommendation of the state Board of Prison Terms.</LD>
<TE>   Wallace, a high school graduate who had no previous criminal
record, was set free at 4:30 p.m. after the state Department of
Corrections received notice of the decision. Wallace, who could still
face a new trial, is due back in court Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Judge David S. Wesley overturned the murder conviction, saying
Wallace had clearly been a battered woman and had been convicted at a
time when very little was known about domestic violence.</TE>
<TE>   "I am going to order a new trial in this case, and I am going to
release the defendant on her own recognizance," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace, who had served more than 17 years in prison, began crying
when the judge announced his ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Several family members and friends, seated in the otherwise
largely empty Los Angeles courtroom, applauded and let out a cheer.</TE>
<TE>   "My heart is about to burst," Wallace's mother, Deloris Wallace,
said outside the courtroom afterward. "I am just so happy. I've been
praying and praying for this day."</TE>
<TE>   Wallace's 25-year-old son, Jessie Martin, said, "Finally, a mom.
You know, a grandma will take care of you. But it ain't like mom."</TE>
<TE>   Greeted by Family</TE>
<TE>   Several hours later, wearing an olive green blazer and matching
skirt with white high-heel shoes, Wallace was released from Wesley's
courtroom. Family members, a preacher and a friend greeted her
tearfully.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, her sister, Ruby, 38, ran and hugged her.
Wallace let out a scream of joy as she walked out of the courthouse
and into the parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank God," Wallace said as she caught her breath to stop crying
and held hands with her mother and sister. "I'm just happy to be with
my family."</TE>
<TE>   Her mother said she had planned a party and prepared her
daughter's favorite meal: fried chicken, cornbread and cabbage.</TE>
<TE>   The state law, enacted in January, applies to women convicted
before 1992, when California courts began allowing expert testimony
about battered women's syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys critical of Davis' record of opposing parole of
virtually all murderers see the law as an alternate route to freeing
women like Wallace.</TE>
<TE>   Davis Saw Risk</TE>
<TE>   In overruling the recommendation for Wallace's parole, Davis said
he had determined that her release "would create too great a risk of
public safety."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Davis spokesman Byron Tucker said that the governor
believes that battered women's syndrome can be a legitimate defense,
but that he had decided in the Wallace case that the trial court was
in a better position than he was to make an evaluation.</TE>
<TE>   Since becoming governor, Davis has paroled only two of 139
murderers whom the parole board has recommended for release.</TE>
<TE>   "Women are not being released on parole," said Wallace's attorney,
Michael Brennan. "The Legislature felt these women should have the
opportunity to ask the court for relief. I'm very happy for Marva.
She's been in custody much too long for what happened in this case."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm speechless," said Olivia Wang, director of the California
Coalition for Battered Women in Prison. "It is so gratifying to see a
judge recognize that battered woman syndrome was a factor in this
case and do the right thing."</TE>
<TE>   Wang said she hoped the ruling would improve prospects for other
battered women convicted of killing their abusers and seeking
release. So far this year, Davis has blocked the parole of eight such
women in addition to Wallace; decisions on three more cases are
pending.</TE>
<TE>   Behavioral Condition</TE>
<TE>   Medical experts define battered women's syndrome as a behavioral
condition that affects those who are systematically abused. The
pattern of violence leaves women feeling powerless, so they tend to
stay in abusive relationships and may ultimately see suicide or
homicide as the only way out.</TE>
<TE>   Marva Wallace's marriage lasted a year. Within two months, her
husband, Glendell Boykin, started beating her, often leaving her
bruised and bloodied, according to court papers.</TE>
<TE>   Boykin would not let her work, refused to give her money to
support her children and kept her isolated from her family. Boykin
used crack cocaine regularly and had abused his first wife, court
papers stated.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace moved back to her mother's house in Los Angeles once, but
returned to her husband in Long Beach when he promised not to beat
her again. But she said the abuse didn't stop.</TE>
<TE>   On April 21, 1984, Wallace asked Boykin if she could take her
2-year-old daughter to the girl's grandmother's house. Boykin became
angry, slapped her and made her perform oral sex while her daughter
watched, court papers stated.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly afterward, Wallace went into her daughter's bedroom, got a
gun and shot Boykin three times in the back of his head.</TE>
<TE>   During her trial, Wallace and six friends and relatives testified
to the abuse, but no expert told jurors about the effect of that
abuse on Wallace's mental state. She was convicted of first-degree
murder and sentenced to 27 years to life in state prison.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Prison Terms reviewed Wallace's case in 2001,
consulted an expert on battered women's syndrome and determined that
she had been a victim of domestic violence. The board urged the Los
Angeles trial court to consider reducing her sentence if it
determined that the trial results would have been different if
evidence about the abuse had been admitted into evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Then the new law went into effect and attorneys for Wallace filed
a writ of habeas corpus, asking that the conviction be overturned or
that the sentence be reduced.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Wesley called a hearing that began Oct. 10 and finished
Friday in his downtown Los Angeles courtroom. During the hearing,
Wallace took the witness stand and detailed the abuse by her husband,
describing how he had punched her, slapped her and kicked her.</TE>
<TE>   The assaults occurred after events such as a visit by a niece and
a trip to take her sister to register for college. Wallace testified
that she had been terrified of Boykin and had felt that there was no
way to escape.</TE>
<TE>   'I Was Afraid'</TE>
<TE>   "He told me if I ever tried to leave him again, he would kill
me.... I was afraid that he will harm me or harm my daughter," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   After she shot him, Wallace testified, she felt scared, ashamed
and degraded. She admitted that she initially lied to police and
failed to tell them about the forced oral sex. She also acknowledged
that she had tried to hide the murder from her family.</TE>
<TE>   Two of Wallace's family members also testified during the hearing
about seeing bruises, black eyes and "busted lips" on Wallace. Her
sister, Ruby Wallace, said, "She wanted to leave, but she was scared
to leave." Her mother, Deloris Wallace, said she had called the
police once, but that Marva had begged her not to tell them about the
abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Kaser-Boyd, an expert in battered women's syndrome, said
Boykin had been a classic batterer because of his jealous and
controlling behavior, and that Wallace had clearly suffered from
battered women's syndrome at the time of the killing. She testified
that battered women often keep their abuse hidden and don't seek help
from police or doctors.</TE>
<TE>   "She was extremely distressed and fearful and clinically
depressed," said Kaser-Boyd, a psychologist.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony 'Crucial'</TE>
<TE>   Wallace's attorney argued that his client had been convicted of
first-degree murder because of the lack of evidence of battered
women's syndrome. That testimony would have helped jurors understand
why Wallace had never called police about the abuse or had gone to a
hospital for treatment and why she had never left, Brennan said. It
would have also supported the credibility of Wallace.</TE>
<TE>   "All of that testimony was crucial to her defense," he said. "Had
it been presented, it would have resulted in a different outcome."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Hyman Sisman countered that he did not believe
an expert's testimony would have been likely to change the verdict.
Wallace bought a gun a month before the murder and tried to cover up
the killing afterward, which prosecutors say showed that the killing
"was not a killing in the heat of passion, but a premeditated act of
murder," Sisman wrote in court papers.</TE>
<TE>   After hearing arguments Friday, Wesley ruled that the outcome of
the trial probably would have been different had testimony on
battered women's syndrome been allowed. He said Wallace is not a
danger to the community or a flight risk, and that she would not have
to be behind bars while she waited for a new trial.</TE>
<TE>   Sisman said Friday that the district attorney's office had not
decided whether to try the case again, but Brennan said he expected
the two sides to settle the case without a new trial. The possibility
of a new trial will be discussed at the hearing Monday.</TE>

<HD>Choice of Wellstone's Successor May Determine Senate
Control</HD>
<DH>Minnesota Democrats face key decision, with insiders
focusing on ex-VP Walter Mondale.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>With the death of Sen. Paul Wellstone, Minnesota Democrats face a
wrenching decision that could determine the fierce struggle for
control of the U.S. Senate.</LD>
<LD>   Both national and state Democrats had been increasingly confident
Wellstone would beat back a formidable challenge from Republican Norm
Coleman, the former St. Paul mayor, in the Nov. 5 elections. Now,
state and national Democrats must decide which replacement candidate
would have the best chance of holding the seat.</LD>
<LD>   Though half a dozen names immediately generated speculation as
possible replacements, Democratic sources said Friday that many
insiders -- including organized labor, a powerful force in the
Minnesota party -- were focusing on 74-year-old former Vice President
Walter F. Mondale, who served in the Senate from Minnesota from 1964
to '76.</LD>
<TE>   "People are scrambling around," said one senior labor official.
"But wiser minds are leaning toward Walter Mondale, if he will do
it."</TE>
<TE>   Mondale did not return a call to his law office in Minnesota
seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   The choice is critical because of the tight national battle
between the two parties for a Senate majority. Democrats now hold a
one-seat majority, and at least five other Senate races remain too
close to call, so they can ill-afford to lose Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   The latest polls gave Wellstone a narrow but steady lead. If
Wellstone's death puts the race back in play for Coleman, it would
significantly improve the GOP's odds of recapturing control of the
Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Other names under discussion as possible Wellstone successors
include Mondale's son, Ted Mondale, a former state senator who lost a
bid for the gubernatorial nomination in 1998, and former state Atty.
Gen. Hubert "Skip" Humphrey III, who won that nomination but lost the
general election to independent Jesse Ventura. Humphrey is the son of
another famed Minnesota politician, former Vice President Hubert H.
Humphrey.</TE>
<TE>   Also being mentioned are Alan Page, a former star defensive tackle
for the Minnesota Vikings now serving as a justice on the Minnesota
Supreme Court; Atty. Gen. Mike Hatch; and Judith Dutcher, the state
auditor.</TE>
<TE>   It is likely to take Minnesota Democrats several days to make
their decision -- under the intensely interested eye of national
party leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be a few days before it is decided," said one national
Democratic official. "Not because of contrived mourning, but because
of actual mourning."</TE>
<TE>   Added another top Washington Democrat: "These people are just
devastated. There are no informed conversations yet."</TE>
<TE>   The earliest the state Democratic-Farmer-Labor party, as it is
known in Minnesota, could pick a successor is Tuesday. Party bylaws
require 72 hours notice before it can meet to make the decision.</TE>
<TE>   The latest the Democrats could act is Friday. State law allows a
party to replace a nominee who dies until four days before the
election. But it requires them to act within seven days of the
vacancy.</TE>
<TE>   That means, for the next few days at least, that Wellstone's death
will freeze the campaign. Sources close to Coleman say he has
suspended campaigning indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   The tragedy is reminiscent of a plane crash late in the 2000
campaign that killed Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan, the Democratic
Senate nominee against GOP incumbent John Ashcroft.</TE>
<TE>   Carnahan had been trailing in the polls. But his name stayed on
the ballot and his Democratic successor as governor indicated he
would appoint Carnahan's widow, Jean, to the seat if the dead man
received the most votes. Amid a wave of sympathy, that's what
happened, and Jean Carnahan took office, a crucial win for the
Democrats. She's now in a tight race for a full term against
Republican Jim Talent.</TE>
<TE>   One national Democratic official involved in talks with leaders of
the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party says some were talking initially
about trying to leave Wellstone's name on the ballot, as a gesture of
respect and in the belief that he would win the most votes.</TE>
<TE>   But Democratic lawyers, both locally and nationally, say that
option appears to be prohibited under state law.</TE>
<TE>   Less clear is what will happen to absentee ballots that have
already been mailed. Minnesota law states: "Absentee ballots that
have been mailed prior to the [vacancy] ... shall be counted in the
same manner as if the vacancy had not occurred."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles attorney Fred Woocher said that leaves open the
question of whether absentee ballots cast for Wellstone will be
discarded or assigned to the Democratic replacement.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a real problem in either of these two options. One gives
an obvious advantage to the Republican candidate; the other assumes
the voter's intent to vote for the Democratic nominee and not for the
individual candidate himself or herself," Woocher said.</TE>
<TE>   Raleigh Hannah Levine, a professor at William Mitchell Law School
in St. Paul, noted another twist. Because of Wellstone's death,
Coleman or a replacement Democratic candidate would take office
immediately after the election.</TE>
<TE>   If Coleman wins, that could give Republicans a Senate majority for
a postelection session, regardless of which party holds the majority
in January. There's a similar possibility if Talent beats Carnahan,
who also has been filling a vacant seat.</TE>
<TE>   If the party reaches back to Mondale, it would be the second time
in recent weeks it has sought rescue from an older former senator.
When Sen. Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.) withdrew from his reelection
campaign, state Democrats picked 78-year-old former Sen. Frank
Lautenberg to replace him.</TE>
<TE>   Mondale hasn't run for public office since his landslide defeat by
Ronald Reagan in the 1984 presidential race.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vice President Dick Cheney and Halliburton Co. have asked a federal
judge to throw out a lawsuit accusing them of defrauding investors by
changing accounting methods at the oil field-services company.</LD>
<LD>   Cheney was chairman and chief executive of the Dallas-based
company when it changed its accounting to recognize more revenue from
construction projects that had cost overruns.</LD>
<LD>   Judicial Watch, a government watchdog group, sued Cheney, the
company, its directors and accountant Arthur Andersen in July in
federal district court in Dallas.</LD>
<TE>   The group charged that Halliburton's accounting change resulted in
overstating revenue from 1999 to 2001 by $445 million, which pumped
up Halliburton's share price and cost investors millions when the
stock declined this year.</TE>
<TE>   The defendants met a Thursday deadline for responding to the
lawsuit by filing a motion to dismiss the case.</TE>
<TE>   A copy of the motion was not available Friday.</TE>

<HD>Wider Pentagon Spy Role Is Urged</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Greg Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- An influential Pentagon advisory board is calling for a
major expansion of the U.S. special forces' role in combating
terrorism, and is seeking a new White House office to plan
"preemptive" covert operations across the globe.</LD>
<LD>   The classified proposals urge the Pentagon to "take the terrorist
threat as seriously as it takes ... major theater war," urging
officials to launch secret missions and intelligence operations to
penetrate and disrupt terrorist cells abroad.</LD>
<LD>   Some of those operations should be aimed at signaling to countries
harboring terrorists that "their sovereignty will be at risk,"
according to a summary of the Defense Science Board's recommendations
that were described to The Times.</LD>
<TE>   The recommendations were presented this week in high-level
Pentagon briefings conducted by members of the board, a little-known
but highly respected advisory group that is funded and controlled by
the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the proposals would appear to push the military into
territory that has traditionally been the domain of the CIA, raising
questions about the extent to which such missions would be subject to
legal restraints imposed on CIA activities.</TE>
<TE>   But William Schneider Jr., chairman of the Defense Science Board,
rejected such concerns, saying the panel set out to identify ways
that special forces could do more to assist the war on terrorism, not
encroach on other agencies' authority.</TE>
<TE>   "The CIA executes the plans but they use Department of Defense
assets," Schneider said. He stressed that the board is not
recommending any changes to long-standing U.S. policies banning
assassinations or requiring presidents to approve U.S. covert
operations. Nor, he said, is the panel advocating changes that would
erode congressional oversight.</TE>
<TE>   The proposals, Schneider said, were "well-received" by senior
Pentagon officials and are scheduled to be presented to Defense
Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld next week.</TE>
<TE>   The board's recommendations are outlined in a 78-page briefing
document obtained by defense analyst and Los Angeles Times military
columnist William M. Arkin. The document is explored in an Arkin
column scheduled to appear in Sunday's Opinion section.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon Role Debated</TE>
<TE>   It is sure to add to a growing debate over the Pentagon's
expanding role in the war on terrorism, intelligence collection and
covert operations.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld has touched off turf battles with the CIA and other
agencies in recent months as he has sought to consolidate authority
over intelligence gathering in the Pentagon and craft a more
assertive role for U.S. special forces in an array of overseas
activities.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Rumsfeld acknowledged that shortly after the Sept. 11
attacks last year, his office had created a special intelligence
analysis unit to examine evidence of links between Al Qaeda and Iraq,
a task that would ordinarily fall to the CIA.</TE>
<TE>   At a press briefing, Rumsfeld said the Pentagon has "an excellent
relationship" with the agency.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld has already been carving out an expanded role for special
forces. He recently gave the special operations command the lead in
the hunt for Al Qaeda, raising the possibility of covert operations
even in countries with which the United States is not at war. Other
Pentagon and intelligence officials say Rumsfeld is deeply frustrated
with the CIA's analyses on key issues such as the threat posed by
Iraq. He is eager to have U.S. special forces usurp the agency's
traditional role, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "He was upset when U.S. forces got on the ground in Afghanistan
last August and had to be introduced to local tribal leaders by CIA
operatives," said one senior Defense official. Rumsfeld would rather
have covert Pentagon operatives "operating elbow to elbow with the
CIA or independent of the CIA," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the proposals in the Defense Science Board's report would
push the Pentagon toward that goal.</TE>
<TE>   The report is titled "Summer Study on Special Operations and Joint
Forces in Support of Countering Terrorism." It was produced by a
10-member panel of military experts that included Vice Adm. William
O. Studeman, former director of the National Security Agency, which
eavesdrops on electronic communications around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Department spokeswoman Victoria Clarke said she was not
familiar with the report. "There are literally thousands of private
individuals who give the Pentagon advice and recommendations of all
shapes and kinds," she said. "Some of it gets taken on, and some
doesn't."</TE>
<TE>   But experts said the Defense Science Board occupies a unique
position. "The board is probably the most influential group the
Pentagon has," said Lawrence J. Korb, an assistant secretary of
Defense in the Reagan administration. "People pay attention to the
board."</TE>
<TE>   A Changing Mission</TE>
<TE>   The document focuses on the shifting counter-terrorism mission of
U.S. special forces, which include the Army Green Berets, Delta Force
operatives and Navy SEALs.</TE>
<TE>   One of its principle recommendations calls for the creation of a
"Proactive Preemptive Operating Group" that would oversee missions
involving special forces, psychological warfare experts and other
covert operatives.</TE>
<TE>   One aim would be to "improve information collection by stimulating
reactions" among intelligence targets. Experts interpreted that to
mean operations designed to provoke terrorists to move material or
shift locations, thereby exposing their members and methods to
intelligence collection.</TE>
<TE>   One version of the report says the group would be run out of the
National Security Council. Schneider, the board's chairman, stressed
that subsequent drafts make clear that the NSC would plan operations
but not oversee their execution.</TE>
<TE>   Such an arrangement might prompt comparisons to past abuses, such
as the Iran-Contra operations run out of the NSC by Lt. Col. Oliver
North during the Reagan administration.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem with Ollie North is that he was in the operations
business -- he was running things," Schneider said. Under the board's
proposal, NSC plans would be executed by the Pentagon or the CIA. He
insisted those operations would still be subject to existing
government restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional Concern</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers have expressed growing concern with Rumsfeld's push to
expand the Pentagon's covert capabilities, largely because the
Pentagon is not subject to rules that require the CIA to report its
covert activities to Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, recently said he is on the lookout for operations or plans
to evade congressional scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   Still, most lawmakers and administration officials acknowledge
that Sept. 11 highlighted the need for significant changes in the
nation's intelligence and counter-terrorism efforts. The Defense
Science Board is the latest to enter an intense debate on the shape
of those changes.</TE>
<TE>   Its report concludes that the United States is too reliant on
satellites and other "remote" collection capabilities and needs to
pursue ways to insert agents or "in-place sensors" to monitor
terrorist cells and the movements of weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   It recommends that the Pentagon deploy more spies of its own
around the world and that it expand existing covert units, now
restricted to the Army, to include all branches of the military. It
calls for billions of dollars in new expenditures.</TE>
<TE>   The report recommends that the Pentagon develop a database of
retirees, reservists and others with special training in covert
operations and intelligence "to serve on short notice" in cases of
national emergency or looming war.</TE>
<TE>   The document suggests that many changes are already underway.</TE>
<TE>   It cites the expansion of existing intelligence analysis centers
and the creation of new management teams to direct covert operations
at such installations as Ft. Bragg, N.C., where U.S. special forces
are based.</TE>
<TE>   It also provides tantalizing glimpses of new capabilities,
referring to new high-tech sensors in development that would enable
the United States to more closely track the movements of vehicles or
even individuals by satellite.</TE>
<TE>   In the document's final pages, the board advises the Pentagon that
adopting its various recommendations will make it "better able to
anticipate terrorist behavior and react to bolts out of the gray,"
such as the Sept. 11 terrorist strikes.</TE>

<KH>PAUL WELLSTONE: 1944 - 2002</KH>
<HD>Sen. Wellstone Dies in Minn. Plane Crash</HD>
<DH>A top liberal Democrat is among 8 killed, including his
wife and daughter. He was in a tight race that may affect who
controls the Senate.</DH>

<DL>ST. PAUL, Minn.</DL>
<LD>Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.), a leading liberal voice in Congress
who was locked in a tight reelection campaign, was killed in a plane
crash in his home state Friday, along with his wife, daughter and
five others.</LD>
<LD>   His death 11 days before the Nov. 5 election -- coming as
Democrats thought he was gaining the upper hand in the race -- could
have major repercussions on the battle for the Senate. Democrats had
a one-seat margin, and the Minnesota race is one of a handful
expected to determine which party controls the Senate next year.</LD>
<LD>   State law allows the Democrats to substitute a name on the ballot
up to four days before the election.</LD>
<TE>   Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, who previously
represented Minnesota in the Senate, is a prominent name under
consideration.</TE>
<TE>   Wellstone, 58, was on his way to the funeral of a state lawmaker's
father when the twin-engine plane went down in a light snow in
northern Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the crash, including the possibility of icing on the
wings, was under investigation. All eight people on board died,
including three staff members and two pilots.</TE>
<TE>   The staffers were identified as Will McLaughlin, 23, Tom Lapic,
49, and Mary McEvoy, 49. Richard Conry, 55, and Michael Guess, 30,
were named as the pilots.</TE>
<TE>   "As adults, we don't have a lot of heroes. But he was my hero,"
said Charlie Bulman, one of thousands of Wellstone supporters who
gathered on the steps of the state Capitol in St. Paul on a drizzly,
windy night Friday to mourn the senator.</TE>
<TE>   Wellstone, in one of his last votes, opposed the Senate resolution
passed earlier this month authorizing President Bush to use military
force against Iraq. As was typical during much of his Senate tenure,
Wellstone found himself very much in the minority on the issue; the
resolution passed, 77 to 23.</TE>
<TE>   But Wellstone was well-liked by partisan friend and foe alike, and
widely respected for his commitment to his political beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   Bush took note of that in paying tribute to Wellstone, calling him
a "man of deep convictions, a plain-spoken fellow who did his best
for his state and for his country."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), pausing from his own reelection
campaign, broke down in tears as he spoke of Wellstone, a frequent
comrade-in-arms for liberal causes.</TE>
<TE>   "Paul Wellstone was my closest friend in the Senate," Harkin said
after composing himself. "He was the most principled public servant
I've ever known.... It didn't matter a bit if his was the only vote
for or against something."</TE>
<TE>   In a typical comment from conservative colleagues, Sen. Larry E.
Craig (R-Idaho) said that while he and Wellstone "differed
philosophically and politically, I greatly admired and respected his
energy and his commitment to public policy and the people of
Minnesota."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "Paul was honest, cheerful and had a wonderful sense of
humor."</TE>
<TE>   Another of Capitol Hill's most consistent liberals, Rep. Maxine
Waters (D-Los Angeles), called Wellstone "more than just another
Democrat. He was a Democrat in the mold of the Kennedys and Franklin
Delano Roosevelt. He made me proud to be called a liberal."</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) called Wellstone "the
soul of the Senate." And Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, an
independent, said the state had "suffered a deep and penetrating
loss."</TE>
<TE>   At the gathering at Minnesota's Capitol, that grief was evident.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Freeman, 49, a volunteer with Wellstone's campaign, said that
he was supposed to join up today with him on the campaign trail. "I
looked into his eyes and I knew there was a lot there," said Freeman,
who is disabled. "I just believed in the man. I just loved the man."</TE>
<TE>   Wellstone was facing a strong challenge from Republican Norm
Coleman, a former mayor of St. Paul, in a race that has been watched
nationally since the campaign's start.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats control the Senate, 50 to 49, with one independent. With
34 seats at stake in the Nov. 5 elections, a net party turnover of
just one seat would flip control to the Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   "Wellstone's passing adds even more uncertainty to an already
volatile political season," said John J. Pitney Jr., a professor of
government at Claremont McKenna College.</TE>
<TE>   Another analyst, Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia, said
he anticipates Democrats will hold Wellstone's seat. "As long as the
state Democratic party nominates a respectable candidate, that
nominee will now be favored to take the seat.... An intense wave of
sympathy may well help all Democrats in Minnesota on Nov. 5," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Like many analysts, Sabato noted the similarity of Wellstone's
death to a plane crash in Missouri late in the 2000 campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan died in that crash less than a month
before election day as he campaigned for the Senate against then-GOP
incumbent John Ashcroft. Carnahan's name remained on the ballot and
he won. His wife, Jean, was appointed to serve in his place.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota state law permits Democrats to substitute Wellstone's
name on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura can appoint a successor until a new senator is elected,
but he declined to say if he plans to do so. Ventura, who is not
seeking reelection, did say he would not appoint himself.</TE>
<TE>   Any appointment would be basically moot, since whoever wins the
election would be sworn into the seat almost immediately, according
to a spokesman for the Minnesota secretary of state.</TE>
<TE>   Wellstone was a 5-foot-5 college wrestling champion who once
called himself a "rock-the-boat politician." The son of Russian
immigrants, the former college professor who was once arrested in a
bank for demonstrating over farm foreclosures upset a heavily
financed incumbent, Republican Rudy Boschwitz, to win election to the
Senate in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Mother Jones magazine called Wellstone "the first 1960s radical
elected to the U.S. Senate."</TE>
<TE>   One of his first votes -- like one of his last -- was opposing a
resolution authorizing the use of military force. He voted against
the 1991 Persian Gulf War resolution. And he was the only senator in
a tight race who voted against the recently approved resolution
authorizing the use of force against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
regime.</TE>
<TE>   Wellstone also was an advocate for the mentally ill. He and Sen.
Pete V. Domenici (R-N. M.), both with close relatives with mental
disorders, have worked together to try to expand health insurance
coverage for mental illness.</TE>
<TE>   In February, he disclosed that he has a mild form of multiple
sclerosis but pledged to continue his bid for a third term.</TE>
<TE>   When he was first elected, Wellstone said he would serve only two
terms. But he said last year he was breaking that promise to continue
to fight for liberal causes, and his reversal didn't seem to cause a
major flap in Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, there was no indication of trouble aboard Wellstone's
plane before it crashed, said Federal Aviation Administration
spokesman Greg Martin.</TE>
<TE>   The twin-engine turboprop, which had taken off from St. Paul, was
about five miles east of its destination, a small airfield in
Eveleth, Minn. Eveleth is a town of about 4,000 residents in the
rugged Iron Range country, 60 miles north of Duluth.</TE>
<TE>   The last contact with the Beech A-100 was a routine communication
about 10:20 a.m. CDT.</TE>
<TE>   Eveleth does not have a control tower, so the pilots would have
been making a visual final approach to the airport for a landing at
their own discretion.</TE>
<TE>   "The plane called in on the [local radio frequency] and [the
pilot] said he was inbound for Runway 2-7," said JoAnn Sipola, who
works at Taconite Aviation Inc., a maintenance facility at the
airport.</TE>
<TE>   She said that a few moments later, air traffic controllers in
Duluth called and said the plane had disappeared from radar. At their
request, Gary Ulman, who owns the maintenance facility, got in his
own private plane to look for possible wreckage.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me it had crashed and burned," Sipola said. "The tail
section was identifiable, but that's about all."</TE>
<TE>   The National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates all
aircraft accidents, sent a team of investigators to the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting Wellstone's prominence, NTSB acting chairwoman Carol
Carmody planned to accompany the team and act as its official
spokesperson.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators will examine the plane's wreckage for signs of
mechanical problems, analyze the weather at the time of the crash,
scrutinize radar data and delve into the backgrounds and actions of
the pilots. The plane is believed to have been equipped with a
cockpit voice recorder, an NTSB official said.</TE>
<TE>   The Beech A-100 that Wellstone was flying in was built in 1989 and
was registered to Beech Transportation of Eden Prairie, Minn. Records
indicate no prior mishaps and no history of unusual problems.</TE>
<TE>   Wellstone's wife, Sheila, was 58; their daughter, Marcia, 33. The
couple had two other children, sons David and Mark, and six
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   In one of his last speeches on the Senate floor, Wellstone
explained his opposition to the Iraq resolution, saying he thought it
was "too open-ended." But he also offered a glimpse of the
characteristics so many praised Friday.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that some pundits had warned that a vote against the
resolution could cost him his Senate seat, which also would cost his
staff their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to thank my staff for never trying one time to
influence me to make any other decision than what I honestly and
truthfully believe is right," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "To all of my staff, I thank you for believing in me."</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>A serial killer who asked to be executed by firing squad without the
traditional hood over his head will be granted his wish, the state
Supreme Court ruled Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Roberto Arguelles made the request after his 1997 conviction for
killing three teen girls and a woman in her 40s.</LD>
<LD>   A court gave its approval, but the execution was delayed after
Arguelles tried to hang himself in prison.</LD>
<TE>   Arguelles underwent a psychiatric evaluation after the suicide
attempt. As required by state law, his case was appealed to the state
Supreme Court, which ruled Friday that the firing squad execution
could go forward.</TE>
<TE>   An execution date is to be set soon by a lower court.</TE>
<TE>   Arguelles' attorney, Ed Brass, said Friday's ruling marks the end
of appeals that can be made without Arguelles' consent.</TE>
<TE>   Among his crimes, Arguelles in 1992 kidnapped friends Tuesday
Roberts, 15, and Lisa Martinez, 16. He sexually assaulted and
strangled Roberts and stabbed Martinez more than 40 times.</TE>

<HD>Town, Gun Maker Wrestle With Link to Shootings</HD>

<DL>WINDHAM, Maine</DL>
<LD>Bookstore owner Barbara Ochse sounded half rueful, half relieved as
she said that nothing of major consequence ever happens here. Well,
she reconsidered, "maybe every once in a while, Stephen King might
mention Windham in a book."</LD>
<LD>   But this placid community north of Portland emerged from obscurity
Friday with word that the weapon used to shoot 13 people in the
Washington, D.C., area was manufactured at Bushmaster Firearms Inc.
here. A hamlet that seemed safe and removed from urban apprehensions
abruptly felt uncomfortably close to horrors that paralyzed a region
and mesmerized a nation. Windham did not rush to welcome its
inadvertent role in the tragedy.</LD>
<LD>   "We're definitely on the map now, let's put it that way," said
David Johnston, proprietor of a country store whose lawn was
scattered with giant Halloween pumpkins.</LD>
<TE>   To many in this town of 10,000, the sudden attention came as a
surprise. Bushmaster, set back off the winding road leading to
Maine's lake country, keeps such a low profile that some longtime
residents said they did not know it existed.</TE>
<TE>   "Windham is actually a fairly large town," said retired chemistry
teacher Dick Brown, using the standards of a state with barely 1
million inhabitants. "And I never knew there was a gun manufacturer
here."</TE>
<TE>   But with annual sales of $36 million, Bushmaster is one of the
area's largest employers and one of the most lucrative enterprises in
a relatively poor state. The privately held company is the country's
largest maker of the civilian version of the M-16 military assault
rifle. Authorities said a Bushmaster XM-15 was seized when John Allen
Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo were taken into custody early Thursday as
suspects in a three-week shooting spree that left 10 dead and three
wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday afternoon, after the company learned from the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms that its gun was probably used in the
attacks, Bushmaster chief executive Richard Dyke addressed the 100
men and women who assemble, package and distribute 50,000 rifles each
year.</TE>
<TE>   "I told my employees to hold their heads up high. There's nothing
we should be ashamed of," said Dyke, whose prosperity has allowed him
to be a local philanthropist and a generous donor to Republican
candidates. His tie tack was a miniature of the Bushmaster XM-15A3,
the company's signature product.</TE>
<TE>   The $900 gun also made headlines three years ago when one was
found in a vehicle belonging to Buford Furrow, who shot four children
and an adult at a Jewish community center in Los Angeles using a
different weapon. After that incident, Dyke resigned as finance
director of Maine's state campaign for George W. Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-five years ago, Dyke paid $280,000 for the company at a
bankruptcy sale. Bushmaster joined a stable of almost 50 companies
Dyke has rescued, ranging from a small hotel in the West Indies to a
firm that bottles after-shave and cologne to one that makes bathroom
vanity tops.</TE>
<TE>   His rifles are sold in 38 countries, as well as to law enforcement
agencies throughout this country.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say this for sure, but I bet if you opened the trunk of
an LAPD squad car, you'd find a Bushmaster along with a shotgun,"
Dyke said.</TE>
<TE>   He described the Bushmaster rifle as "very reliable," and so
accurate that it is used widely by competitive sport shooters and
hunters.</TE>
<TE>   He confirmed that company records showed that a gun matching
specifications provided by the ATF was shipped to a wholesaler in
Washington state in June.</TE>
<TE>   Dyke also said that when law enforcement officials announced that
.223-caliber slugs had been removed from the first victims, it put
his company among only about 10 probable manufacturers of the
sniper's weapon. "Then you further balance that with the fact that we
are the largest," he said. "So we always had the feeling that it may
have been our weapon -- and if it was, we had to think about how we
were going to feel about that."</TE>
<TE>   Dyke said he did not feel good. "Does anyone want anything they
own to get in the hands of a serial killer?" he asked. "The answer is
no."</TE>
<TE>   Most of all, he said, he felt badly that "a deranged serial killer
was able to obtain one of our weapons illegally, I am sure, and
commit these heinous crimes."</TE>
<TE>   Dyke said he understood that some people might feel as a result
that such guns should be banned. "Our Constitution gives them the
right to say that," he said. "But there are those of us who believe
that is not a good course of action."</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, at a health spa called the Heaven and Earth Wellness
Center, Leanna Herrick, 24, all but echoed that philosophy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not who makes the gun. It's who uses it," Herrick said. "I
don't think people should be so focused on who made the gun, rather
than who is out there harming the public."</TE>
<TE>   At the Maine Flag and Banner store, co-owner Valerie Strout said
any connection to the shootings in Washington was purely "a
coincidence" for Windham.</TE>
<TE>   "It was going to be a little town someplace," she shrugged.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Strout said, the fact that the tendrils of the shooting
spree stretched to Windham brought to mind "that everything is
connected at some point."</TE>
<TE>   "People should think about that more often. They need maybe to pay
more attention to the fact that everything they do affects others,"
she said. "You know, the no-man-is-an-island type of thing."</TE>
<TE>   Ochse, leaning against a stack of used mystery novels at Scrooge
and Marley Discount Books, sounded a similar note.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole thing -- everybody has taken it so personally," she
said. "They didn't think it was going to happen in Washington, D.C.
And we certainly didn't think that Windham, Maine, was going to be
affected like this."</TE>

<HD>Irradiated Meat for Schools OKd</HD>
<DH>Agriculture department to allow schoolchildren to be served
the treated food by year's end.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The U.S. Agriculture Department said Friday it plans to allow
irradiated meat to be served to millions of children in U.S. schools
by the end of the year.</LD>
<LD>   Irradiation, which has been endorsed by the World Health
Organization, exposes food to low doses of electrons or gamma rays to
destroy deadly microorganisms, such as E. coli O157:H7 and
salmonella.</LD>
<LD>   Under the U.S. farm subsidy law enacted in May, the USDA must
allow government-approved food safety technology, such as
irradiation, to be used in commodities donated to the federal school
lunch program. About 27 million schoolchildren receive free or
low-cost meals daily in the program.</LD>
<TE>   USDA spokeswoman Alisa Harrison said the school lunch program
prohibits buying irradiated meat.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one we are looking at to see if our regulations need to
be changed to comply with the farm bill," Harrison said. "We hope to
have something by the end of the year."</TE>
<TE>   American food makers have been slow to adopt irradiation treatment
for raw meat and poultry because of the cost of the equipment and
worries about consumer acceptance.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, foods treated with irradiation must carry labels saying
either "treated with irradiation" or "treated by radiation."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. school food service and meat industries have urged the
USDA to implement a pilot program to gradually introduce irradiated
meat to cafeterias.</TE>
<TE>   "It's time for USDA to acknowledge the food safety benefits of
this technology and begin purchasing irradiated ground beef products
for the nation's schoolchildren," said J. Patrick Boyle, president of
the American Meat Institute, an industry group.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Sackin, vice president for the American School Food Service
Assn., said the industry supports irradiation but calls for an
education program to teach communities about it.</TE>

<HD>Southern Lady, With Accent on Spy Career</HD>
<DH>Colleagues celebrate the life of Eloise Randolph Page, the
first female CIA chief of station. She died Oct. 16 at 82.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Johanna Neuman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>She was the quintessential Southern lady, dressed to the nines in St.
John suits and Ferragamo pumps, blond hair always coiffed and nails
always polished.</LD>
<LD>   But Eloise Randolph Page was also a spy -- the first woman in the
Central Intelligence Agency to be named a chief of station. So when
her friends and colleagues came to celebrate her life this week at
Christ Episcopal Church in Georgetown, their stories combined white
gloves with covert operations.</LD>
<LD>   "She was the perfect Southern lady whose proper exterior allowed
her to serve her country in the not always nice world of espionage,"
said James L. Pavitt, the CIA's deputy director of operations.</LD>
<TE>   Once, Pavitt disclosed, CIA officials tapped Page to head a new
division on technology, to be called the Scientific Operations
Branch. Page declined, saying, "I'll be damned if I'll be the chief
SOB." So they changed the name, and Page, who died earlier this month
at the age of 82, broke yet another barrier in the CIA's glass
ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   "I never asked for a promotion," she told the Washington Times 10
years ago when other women at the agency were launching a sex
discrimination lawsuit. "It was tough I was turned down for promotion
several times.... But I didn't battle to get ahead. I got ahead
because I worked hard."</TE>
<TE>   'Never Broke Cover'</TE>
<TE>   The daughter of two proud Virginia families -- the Randolphs were
descended from Thomas Jefferson's mother, and the Pages built the
historic Rosewell Mansion in Gloucester -- never married. She also
never lost her Southern accent, her Cheshire-cat smile or her
old-school view of propriety -- and secrecy.</TE>
<TE>   John Wilhelm, a former Time magazine writer, was a personal
friend. Writing a book on Soviet intelligence, he said he would have
loved to get her views. "She never broke cover with me," he reports.
"She was very much a professional, from the old school."</TE>
<TE>   She attended Hollins College in Roanoke, where she majored in
music, prompting her mother, Lillian Eloise, to predict a career in
the arts. But the younger Eloise had other ideas, working briefly for
the British War Relief Society during World War II and then, in 1942,
going to work for William J. Donovan, the first director of the
Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the CIA.</TE>
<TE>   Known as "Wild Bill" for his "desperate resolution" in commanding
infantrymen in France during World War I, America's most decorated
war hero spent the next war trying to professionalize America's
intelligence capabilities. Encouraged by Britain but distrusted by
FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, Donovan assembled an agency on the run.
Page served as the general's secretary. From him she learned the
lingo, the tempo and the urgency of intelligence work.</TE>
<TE>   As she moved up the ranks of the agency, Page was sensitive to
earning her ranks. She turned down offers to be chief of station, the
top CIA operative in an embassy, in two countries where there was
little need for spying because they were ceremonial posts that
offered no real challenge -- or threat. In 1978, three years after
Marxist terrorists had assassinated chief of station Richard Welch,
she accepted the post of chief of station in Greece. It was a rough
assignment. She thrived.</TE>
<TE>   Page was also effective at interagency warfare, although
apparently she won turf battles more often by force of will than by
breaking the diplomatic china. The only time she lost a tussle with
the State Department, recalled the CIA's Pavitt, was when she was
denied permission to take her beloved golden retrievers, Jeremy and
Lionel, with her to work at the embassy in Greece.</TE>
<TE>   A CIA Trailblazer</TE>
<TE>   She was a lady, but she was not boring. Ron Kessler, author of
several books on intelligence, recently interviewed her in a local
hospital where she had undergone hip replacement surgery. After
talking for a while, she asked if he wanted a drink. Directing him to
the closet, he found some Styrofoam cups and a bottle of her favorite
sherry, Dry Sac, hidden from the nurses.</TE>
<TE>   The posting in Greece heightened her interest in
counter-terrorism, and even after her retirement in 1987 she gave
counter-terrorism training to young analysts and operatives at the
Defense Information Systems Agency at Bolling Air Force Base in
Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   When the CIA turned 50 in 1997, CIA Director George J. Tenet
bestowed awards to 50 trailblazers who had, often silently, nurtured
the agency's history. One of the perks was a lifetime honorary badge
that allowed entry into CIA headquarters in Langley, Va. In the
tightened security after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, a young
security officer who had never heard of Eloise Randolph Page informed
her that her badge was not properly coded and denied her access to
the building. She was devastated. Friends rallied. The bar code was
installed.</TE>
<TE>   Upon her death Oct. 16, Tenet issued a statement calling her "an
intelligence pioneer." He added, "But she did more than amass a
lifetime of unique expertise. From her earliest days of service with
OSS, she was a source of inspiration to others. She will be forever."</TE>
<TE>   To those who knew her personally, memories brought a smile. The
Rev. Marguerite Henninger Steadman, deacon at Christ Church, recalls
once telling Page that they needed a tree branch with which to bless
animals expected at the church's first Festival of St. Francis of
Assisi.</TE>
<TE>   Steadman only needed one branch, but Page, through either a
misunderstanding or a devotion to dogs, all but denuded her favorite
tree to ensure that every dog attending the festival was blessed with
its own branch.</TE>
<TE>   She came walking down the street toward the church, her arms
overflowing with branches, Steadman recalled, saying, "She never held
anything back."</TE>

<KH>THE SNIPER CASE</KH>
<HD>Letter Offered Specifics on Snipers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The cover page is neat and impressive. "For you Mr. Police," it says.
"Call me God." The words are surrounded by five stars placed in an
orderly way.</LD>
<LD>   The letter left at the sniper shooting in Ashland, Va., on Oct. 19
is chilling in its detail and its threats but also provides a
treasure trove of clues.</LD>
<LD>   It contains phone numbers and locations the snipers called in half
a dozen unsuccessful attempts to contact authorities. It also lists
account information about a stolen platinum Visa card that the
assailants wanted reactivated with $10 million that they could freely
access.</LD>
<TE>   "We will have unlimited withdrawl at any atm worldwide," reads the
letter, which continues for three pages after the cover. It provided
the Bank of America card's account number, personal identification
number, the activation and expiration dates and the name of the woman
who legitimately owned the card.</TE>
<TE>   "You will activate the bank account, credit card, and Pin number,"
the letter demanded.</TE>
<TE>   Experts said the letter, a copy of which was obtained by the
Washington Post, indicates the snipers may not have been as clever as
originally thought. The copy confirms reports that the letter
complains about six calls that were dismissed by operators at the
police command center in Rockville, Md., the Montgomery County, Md.,
police department and the FBI -- and that it contains a terrifying
postscript: "Your children are not safe anywhere at any time."</TE>
<TE>   But the letter is surprising in how specific it is -- providing,
for example, the last name of an officer who supposedly took one of
the calls to Montgomery police.</TE>
<TE>   "These people took [our] calls for a hoax or joke, so your failure
to respond has cost you five lives," it said.</TE>
<TE>   The letter was found sealed, in plastic and tacked to a tree
behind a Ponderosa steakhouse in Ashland, where a man was shot and
wounded.</TE>

<HD>A Huge Question Remains Unanswered: 'Why?'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Aaron Zitner</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>John Allen Muhammad visited his estranged family in Maryland in the
months before the shooting spree that terrorized the Washington area,
neighbors say, a potentially important fact for behavioral scientists
trying to determine what turned the would-be businessman and failed
husband into an alleged killer.</LD>
<LD>   While a wealth of information about the Washington-area sniper
slayings has been revealed in recent days, authorities have said
little about what might have motivated Muhammad, 41, and his 17-year
old companion, Lee Boyd Malvo.</LD>
<LD>   Was Muhammad, destitute and allegedly involved in a previous
robbery, out for money? Was he acting out of political ideology, or
anger at American attitudes toward Islam, his adopted religion? Does
he have an identifiable mental illness?</LD>
<TE>   "Why now? Why? Why? Why? Why? That's the question I think everyone
is asking," Malvo's half-brother Rohan said in an interview with CNN.</TE>
<TE>   "In my experience, it's a stew of motives that we're talking about
in a crime of this complexity and magnitude," said Dr. Michael
Welner, a forensic psychiatrist at the New York University School of
Medicine. But at the same time, Welner said, violent criminals often
are motivated by a trigger -- "straws that seemingly break the
camel's back. There are points where the person says: 'Now it's time
to do this.' "</TE>
<TE>   Speculating from limited facts, some specialists in criminal
behavior focused Friday on Muhammad's stormy relationship with his
family, particularly the loss of connection to his three children by
his second wife, Mildred Denice Muhammad.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad twice abducted the children from his ex-wife in Tacoma,
Wash., taking them out of the country on one occasion. Last fall,
after a county sheriff's office returned the children to Mildred
Muhammad, she fled with them to live with relatives in Clinton, Md.</TE>
<TE>   "Losing a job, having kids taken away -- those are the kinds of
huge, major events that people respond to" by committing crimes, said
forensic scientist Brent Turvey, author of the textbook Criminal
Profiling.</TE>
<TE>   "But it can take months for that to happen," Turvey said. "People
get depressed, the depression turns to anger, and that anger might be
directed at other people."</TE>
<TE>   Criminal psychologists said it was noteworthy that Muhammad had
come to his ex-wife's Maryland neighborhood in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbor Robert Graves ran into Muhammad in Clinton about a month
ago while Graves was walking his dogs.</TE>
<TE>   And Nzingha Raufu, 13, said she saw Muhammad pick up his eldest
son, John Allen Jr., 12, to go on a picnic about three months ago.
Raufu, who attends seventh grade with John, said she talked to the
boy later, and he did not talk about any tension with his father.</TE>
<TE>   The contact with his family could be an important element of
Muhammad's emotional life before the shooting spree, and possibly a
trigger to violence, criminal behavior specialists said.</TE>
<TE>   "I sure would like to know what happened there," said Eric Hickey,
who teaches criminal psychology at Cal State Fresno. "I'm wondering,
did he have a stark realization then of loss and regret? Did that
fuel his anger?"</TE>
<TE>   He speculated that seeing his son might have reminded Muhammad he
had failed in many aspects of his life: A planned karate school and
an auto repair business had gone bust, two marriages had collapsed
and he was unable to maintain intimacy with his family.</TE>
<TE>   Others said a political motive may have brought Muhammad to
Washington, and that it was coincidental that his family was nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Levin, a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston,
speculated Muhammad might have harbored resentment against Americans
in general for a perceived abuse of Muslims after the Sept. 11, 2001,
terrorist attacks. Moreover, he noted, Malvo was an illegal immigrant
from Jamaica and subject to deportation.</TE>
<TE>   "Both of them may have felt abused since 9/11," Levin said.</TE>
<TE>   Others noted that Muhammad had a long history of trying to control
his family and of resorting to violence when he did not get his way.</TE>
<TE>   But after losing his business and family, Muhammad may have seen a
shooting spree as a way to exert control over an entire region of the
country. Residents spent weeks in fear, and police were forced to
repeat certain phrases dictated by the killer.</TE>
<TE>   "These crimes are partly a desire to be seen not just in control,
but to demonstrate superiority," Turvey said. "It's all about being
perceived as skillful and powerful."</TE>
<TE>   Another factor in Muhammad's motivation may have been his
relationship with Malvo.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes the insanity is in the relationship," Levin said.
"People will do the most horrific things when they're together that
they wouldn't do individually, because they are feeding on each
other's fantasies."</TE>
<TE>   Still, profit would be one motive among many, Levin said.</TE>
<TE>   "This guy lost his company," he said, summing up. "He was in his
second nasty divorce. He lost custody of his children. He was a
homeless guy. He had no job and no hope for the future.</TE>
<TE>   "Then, here's a chance to make $10 million fast, and at the same
time get even with all those Americans who abused -- from his point
of view -- Muslims and immigrants since 9/11. So, why not do it?"</TE>

<KH>THE SNIPER CASE</KH>
<HD>Sniper Suspect Drifted Across the Americas</HD>
<DH>John Allen Muhammad's wanderings took him from gun shops in
Tacoma, Wash., to Antigua with his kids.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Fineman, Eric Slater and Sam Howe Verhovek</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>TACOMA, Wash.</DL>
<LD>TACOMA, Wash. -- Suspected sniper John Allen Muhammad had a fondness
for the Bushmaster .223-caliber rifle, the model linked to 11 of the
14 shootings that terrorized the nation's capital. He bought two of
them at gun shops here in the last three years -- including the
suspected murder weapon, according to gun shop employees and other
sources.</LD>
<LD>   Muhammad also spent time in the eastern Caribbean island of
Antigua, where he fraudulently got himself a passport during the
months he spent there with his three children in 2000. His former
wife asserted in desperate court filings in Tacoma during their
absence that he had "abducted" the children.</LD>
<LD>   And long before he changed his name from John Allen Williams last
year, Muhammad spent 15 years in the U.S. Army, plowing down antitank
berms with the Dragoons of the 2nd Armored Cavalry in America's push
to drive Iraq from Kuwait. He was honorably discharged in April 1994,
he stated in an affidavit the following year.</LD>
<TE>   These are among the tantalizing details that began to emerge about
Muhammad across a wide swath of the Americas on Friday, as witnesses,
acquaintances and others who came in contact with the 41-year-old New
Orleans native weighed in with pieces in the puzzle of his life.</TE>
<TE>   Among the more dramatic disclosures were Muhammad's rifle
purchases here. Authorities believe the Bushmaster linked to the
sniper spree was shipped in June to Bull's Eye Shooter Supply in
Tacoma by Maine-based Bushmaster Firearms Inc., and bought later by
Muhammad.</TE>
<TE>   Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms on Friday
pored through the records of the store, the largest firearms outlet
in Pierce County, and their investigation continued into the evening.</TE>
<TE>   Although the shop, in a two-story brick building near downtown
that sports a huge mural of safari animals on the side, is owned by a
former U.S. Army sniper instructor, there is no indication he knew
Muhammad, who finished his Army tour of duty at nearby Ft. Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad bought the rifle when he was under a restraining order
for domestic violence in his divorce case, which legal sources in
Seattle said should have prevented him from buying any type of
firearm in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Across town from Bull's Eye, employees at Welcher's Gun Shop said
that Muhammad had bought another, nearly identical Bushmaster on Dec.
28, 1999, and sold the rifle back to the shop five months later.</TE>
<TE>   "We then sold that firearm to another individual," relieved owner
John Welcher said Friday after the ATF descended on his shop.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, officials in the twin-island nation of Antigua and
Barbuda confirmed Friday that Muhammad had obtained an Antiguan
passport two years ago by swearing that his mother was an Antiguan
named Eva Ferris.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad's marriage certificate on file in Baton Rouge, La., where
he spent most of his childhood years, states that his mother's name
was Merdie Holiday. And the daughter of the real Eva Ferris, Muriel
Allen, told reporters in Antigua that she is a teacher at the school
where Muhammad enrolled his children during his stay.</TE>
<TE>   There was no indication why Muhammad secured the Antiguan
passport, which was issued on July 4, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   In the affidavit Muhammad filed in Pierce County court here in his
divorce from Mildred Muhammad, he said that he took the couple's
children with him to Antigua on March 27, 2000, because his ex-wife
had asked him to take care of them for a while.</TE>
<TE>   He stated in the affidavit, which he filed in an effort to fight
the restraining order, that when he arrived on the island he stayed
with Jeanette Killman, whose cousin was a friend of Muhammad in
Tacoma.</TE>
<TE>   "Four months later, I got a place of our own," Muhammad stated,
adding, "In late June 2000, I returned with the children to Tacoma
... because Antigua seemed pretty backward -- no Internet or other
technological advances.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyway, we ended up in Bellingham," Wash.</TE>
<TE>   New details Friday showed it was one of Muhammad's later stays in
Bellingham that provided the first known link between him and Lee
Boyd Malvo, the 17-year-old Jamaican who was arrested with Muhammad
inside a worn, 1990 Chevrolet Caprice at a rest stop in suburban
Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   Federal immigration officials in Seattle confirmed that Malvo and
his Jamaican mother, Una James, were arrested in Bellingham on Dec.
19. Muhammad and Malvo together had checked into a mission in town
two months earlier, and Malvo enrolled himself in high school, where
he endeared himself to many.</TE>
<TE>   But on Friday, INS officials in Seattle said Malvo and his mother
were detained after Malvo's mother called police and accused Muhammad
of domestic abuse. Police turned James and Malvo over to the INS.</TE>
<TE>   Under questioning, James claimed not to know the boy -- an
apparent effort to keep him in the U.S. if she was deported. But
Malvo told agents he was the woman's son and that they had taken a
boat from Jamaica to Haiti and then on to Miami, where they landed
illegally in June 1999, INS officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The two were held for just under a month and released on a $1,500
bond pending an immigration hearing, now scheduled for Nov. 20.</TE>
<TE>   With the suspects now tied to this Seattle suburb, police have
begun looking into unsolved homicides and on Friday reopened one they
consider especially interesting.</TE>
<TE>   In February, Keenya Cook, 21, was shot once with a .45-caliber
handgun as she stood in her aunt's doorway. The aunt, Isa Nichols,
had worked as an accountant for Muhammad and came to know the family,
Tacoma Police Department spokesman Jim Mattheis said. When the couple
divorced, Nichols sided with Mildred. Police are trying to learn
whether an angry Muhammad may have sought out Nichols and killed her
niece by mistake.</TE>

<KH>THE SNIPER CASE</KH>
<HD>Students Now Reclaim Their Playgrounds</HD>
<DH>As blinds were opened and dark paper came off windows all
across Montgomery County, kids stormed outside, ready to enjoy
recess.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vicki Kemper</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KENSINGTON, Md.</DL>
<LD>"Three, two, one!" screamed the gifted-and-talented pupils at
Kensington Parkwood Elementary School. And just as the countdown
reached its crescendo, teacher Marilyn Ochs ripped open the blinds on
their classroom window, letting natural light filter in for the first
time since the Washington-area sniper attacks began more than three
weeks ago.</LD>
<LD>   At Bel Pre Primary School, just blocks from the bus stop where the
13th and final victim died, first-graders released green and yellow
balloons before dancing outside, encouraged by their teachers to let
their fears float away as well.</LD>
<LD>   At schools all across Montgomery County on Friday, as teachers
ceremonially pulled open blinds and tore down the black paper that
had been shielding their students from the sniper's deadly sights,
children were screaming and yelling and once again enjoying outdoor
recess.</LD>
<TE>   Yet even as teachers and parents celebrated the end of lockdowns
and "Code Blue" and indoor recess, it was clear that it would take
more than one day's freedom and two suspects' arrests to restore
normality to the lives of the area's children.</TE>
<TE>   Especially for the younger kids, security is not like a favorite
sweater that feels better than ever after it has been lost and found
again. In the neighborhoods where a sniper's bullet felled five
parents, recapturing the carefree essence of childhood is going to
take a lot of forgetting and at least a little time.</TE>
<TE>   "There are two snipers," an 8-year-old boy told his classmates,
staring down at his lap. "There's a little boy and a man, and the
little boy's mom is still out there hiding."</TE>
<TE>   If other children were less confused and frightened about the
circumstances that ended their school-time quarantine, they expressed
ambivalence about Friday's activities.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of weird" to have recess outside again, said a
third-grade boy at Chevy Chase Elementary School, where officials
allowed a reporter to speak to students only if their names weren't
used.</TE>
<TE>   Outdoor recess "was great but I wasn't used to it," another
third-grader said.</TE>
<TE>   "I almost forgot what the playground was like," said one of his
classmates, quickly adding that her 8th birthday was only two days
away.</TE>
<TE>   Reviewing his first outdoor recess performance in three weeks, one
boy said: "We were playing four-square and we thought we were really
good, but we weren't any more."</TE>
<TE>   "I usually play basketball," a girl chimed in, "but I didn't make
as many hoops."</TE>
<TE>   A few boys stopped their soccer game to find some good things to
say about "indoor recess," the school district's euphemism for its
ban on outdoor activities.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, the boys said, they could bring their Legos. Sometimes
they got to watch movies and, every few days, the principal would
escort them to the school gym or an enclosed courtyard.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to decide which is better," said a 10-year-old boy who
looked utterly normal -- cool even -- in glasses and spiky haircut.</TE>
<TE>   "I want it to last forever," swooned a freckle-faced fifth grader
at Chevy Chase, even as her friends, all braces and bubble gum,
signaled the end of recess.</TE>
<TE>   "It was hard being cooped up inside this classroom for three
weeks," a thoughtful third-grade boy said. "It's like you're in a
bird cage."</TE>
<TE>   All the same, several fifth-grade girls reveled Friday in the
opportunity to hang out with their friends from other classes. They
also enjoyed running and playing on the monkey bars.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very hyper," confessed a 10-year-old with a pumpkin patch
on her shirt.</TE>
<TE>   A girl on the safety patrol said she was excited about being able
to resume helping other kids across the street and lowering the
school's flags.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been waiting for this day," said a 10-year-old girl wearing
matching psychedelic hearing aids. "It was so annoying to be inside."</TE>
<TE>   For the school's sixth-graders, the resumption of recess was not
the best thing about the end of the sniper-related siege.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really anxious for him to get caught so we could go on
field trips," said one girl, excited that the Halloween miniature
golf trip was suddenly back on.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, a lot had happened -- and not happened -- while thousands
of students in Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia were
cooped up inside their classrooms. As warm, sunny days had grown
shorter and colder, and the leaves on the maples and oaks ringing
their playground turned yellow and orange, opportunities were lost.</TE>
<TE>   Third-graders, taught well to use words like "mad" and "glad" and
"sad" to express their feelings, spoke almost angrily of ended
baseball seasons and missed soccer games and practices.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't feel right to have to stay inside all the time," one
boy said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even the children who were mad said they also were glad.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a little happy because they caught the sniper," said the boy,
who remains worried because the "sniper has a family and they don't
know where his mom is."</TE>
<TE>   And for at least one day, adults took comfort in ear-splitting
screams, the pounding of running feet and the heavy thunk of sneakers
making contact with soccer balls.</TE>
<TE>   "It's startling when you hear the sounds of the children's
giggling, shouting and pulling each other," said Ochs, of Kensington
Parkwood. "You realize what you weren't hearing before."</TE>

<KH>THE SNIPER CASE</KH>
<HD>Two Sniper Suspects Charged With Murder</HD>
<DH>Maryland prosecutor issues warrants. FBI officials seek a
third man for questioning.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ralph Vartabedian and Josh Meyer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A Maryland prosecutor charged John Allen Muhammad and his traveling
companion, Lee Boyd Malvo, with six counts each of first-degree
murder late Friday, the first legal salvo in the sniper killing spree
that flared across two states and the nation's capital.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for Montgomery County, Md., State's Atty. Douglas F.
Gansler confirmed that arrest warrants had been issued for Muhammad
and Malvo, charging them in the six slayings that racked the suburban
county between Oct. 2 and Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, federal officials issued a warrant Friday for a third
man sought for questioning in the purchase of a car used in the
sniper attacks.</LD>
<TE>   The move to charge the two sniper suspects Friday night came in a
six-page document containing terse warrants listing the names of the
sniper victims and accusing Muhammad and Malvo of "premeditated
malice." John P. McLane, the prosecutor's spokesman, said a county
district court commissioner had ordered that the statements of facts
for both defendants "must remain sealed" until they were served with
the charges.</TE>
<TE>   The two defendants are being held at a federal detention center in
Baltimore, where they were taken after their arrests early Thursday
at a rural Maryland roadside rest area. Muhammad was arraigned
Thursday in U.S. District Court on a federal weapon charge. Malvo,
held as a material witness, underwent a closed-door hearing normally
accorded to juveniles.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors and law enforcement officials in Maryland, Virginia
and Alabama have all said they intend to indict the two suspects on
murder charges, triggering a debate about which state could most
quickly send them to the execution chamber.</TE>
<TE>   The decision about who gets to prosecute first could end up in the
lap of the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   Political tempers are already flaring. Although Maryland sustained
the heaviest death toll and much of the investigation was
concentrated there, three slayings occurred in Virginia, which is
widely recognized as one of the most successful states in obtaining
death sentences.</TE>
<TE>   Further complicating the decision is that some federal prosecutors
are considering making the first prosecution in the case. Although
murder by itself is not a federal crime, a prosecution could
potentially be made under the Hobbs Act, which requires proof that
the murders were based on an attempted extortion, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   A consensus has emerged quickly among officials from all the
affected jurisdictions that the slayings warrant the death penalty.
But Maryland and the federal government do not allow executions of
minors; Virginia does. Malvo is 17.</TE>
<TE>   Although all jurisdictions can ultimately prosecute the men on all
pertinent charges, the most attention clearly will go to the first
prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   With many questions about the crimes unanswered, Malvo and
Muhammad are refusing to talk. Both were being interrogated
extensively and separately as authorities tried to gain confessions
that could significantly expedite their prosecutions.</TE>
<TE>   "They are not cooperating," one senior federal law enforcement
official said. "They're not talking. Neither of them. They've clammed
up."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, FBI director Robert S. Mueller III signed a material
witness warrant Friday that seeks the arrest of Nathanel Osbourne, a
Jamaican from Camden, N.J., who is the co-owner with Muhammad of the
1990 Chevrolet Caprice allegedly used in the shootings. Muhammad and
Malvo spent time around the Camden neighborhood where Osbourne lived,
witnesses told the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   Such warrants are issued when authorities believe a person is
likely to flee or otherwise be uncooperative in an investigation.
While Osbourne is not a "subject" of the investigation, Mueller said,
"it is believed that he can provide law enforcement officials with
valuable information regarding this case."</TE>
<TE>   Why Osbourne helped Muhammad purchase and register the vehicle, a
former police car in Bordentown Township, N.J., in mid-September is
not known, according to Camden police. The vehicle allegedly was
modified to allow someone to shoot victims with a rifle equipped with
a scope out of an opening in the trunk, though FBI officials and
other law enforcement authorities would not discuss those details.
The modifications took place after the vehicle was sold by the
township, according to Mayor Mark Roselli.</TE>
<TE>   Although FBI officials said they did not believe anyone else had
taken an active role in the shootings, they were not ready to rule
that out.</TE>
<TE>   "The case is still pending so we are not saying that the two we
have are it or if others are involved," an FBI official said. "There
are still a lot of leads to be covered and loose ends to be tied up.
We are still pursuing a lot of leads and right now we don't know the
extent of the involvement of others, if there are others."</TE>
<TE>   The warrant, which asks anyone with information about Osbourne to
contact a local FBI office, describes him as a black male between
5-feet-4 and 5-feet-8 and 120 pounds, with black hair and brown eyes.
It said he may be driving a 1992 Honda Accord, and that he has ties
to Boston, Camden, Trenton, N.J., and Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   The political dispute over jurisdiction in the case emerged when a
joint agreement expected Friday about who would proceed to trial
first never materialized.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Gansler held a news conference to announce Maryland would
file indictments and assert that "we are able to present the best and
most extensive evidence here in Montgomery County."</TE>
<TE>   That irked federal officials.</TE>
<TE>   "Folks here were disappointed that Gansler moved forward because
he had been asked to wait so we could continue this dialogue and move
forward together," a Justice Department official said. "We are trying
to keep it from getting political. The death penalty is of much
concern to us and their death penalty is extremely weak and it is not
clear it would apply in this case."</TE>
<TE>   Since the U.S. Supreme Court permitted reinstatement of the death
penalty in 1976, Virginia has executed more convicted murderers -- 86
-- than any state except Texas. Death penalty appeals also move
considerably more rapidly than the national average, said Richard
Dieter, director of the Death Penalty Information Center.</TE>
<TE>   Speedy by Comparison</TE>
<TE>   A convicted murderer in Virginia typically is executed three or
four years sooner than a convicted murderer in other states. The
Virginia Supreme Court rarely overturns death sentences. By contrast,
Maryland has executed only three people in the modern death penalty
era and currently has a statewide moratorium on executions.</TE>
<TE>   Some legal experts, including Columbia, S.C., lawyer David Bruck,
said one reason Virginia carries out more executions is the low
caliber of lawyers handling such defendants. Virginia does not have a
state public defender system; Maryland does.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities in Montgomery, Ala., also jumped in Friday, saying at
a news conference that they will file murder charges and will seek
the death penalty. Montgomery police believe that both sniper
suspects took part in a Sept. 21 liquor store shooting that left one
employee dead and another seriously wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery Police Chief John Wilson said Muhammad was believed to
be the gunman, adding that a Montgomery police officer who chased the
gunman had "positively" identified a photograph of Muhammad on
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft has been kept abreast of the
jurisdictional debate even though he is in Asia meeting with
counterparts there in the war on terrorism, said the Justice
Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Ashcroft
will get personally involved when he returns Sunday, the official
said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, new details emerged Friday about missed opportunities
to apprehend the pair much earlier in the killing spree.</TE>
<TE>   One source of confusion for investigators and the public was the
widely publicized focus on finding a white truck or van.</TE>
<TE>   Police in the District of Columbia acknowledged that they had run
a check on Muhammad's Caprice when they spotted it Oct. 3, after the
sniper had already killed five people in Montgomery County and just
hours before Pascal Charlot, 72, was fatally shot in the chest on a
D.C. street corner.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing came back on the tags," District Police Sgt. Joe Gentile
said.</TE>
<TE>   A witness spotted a Caprice near the scene, its lights out while
the car rolled. Police put out a lookout for "what was believed to be
a burgundy-colored Caprice-type vehicle, possibly with tinted
windows," Gentile said. He said the lookout was never canceled.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, there's a strong possibility" that the witness saw the
right car that night, he said. Yet in the days that followed, the
police and public concentrated their efforts on finding a white van
or box truck.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the Oct. 2-3 murder spree, police reported on TV that
at least one witness had spotted a box truck with weathered white
paint. Eventually, the white van was reported seen repeatedly at the
crime scenes. When police set up roadblocks after shootings to catch
a suspect, they concentrated on drivers of white vans.</TE>
<TE>   (The Caprice was stopped "at least five times" at these
roadblocks, according to a senior federal law enforcement official
quoted by Newsday.)</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to go with the best information you had," said Fairfax
County, Va., Police Chief Thomas Manger, noting that investigators
kept telling the public not to limit their observations to white
vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Profiles Were Off</TE>
<TE>   There was also surprise among some that the suspects did not match
the prevailing profiles of the killer -- probably a person from
Montgomery County neighborhoods where the shooting spree began;
perhaps an angry white male. Such presumptions were spouted on
national TV by the growing industry of criminal consultants and
profilers.</TE>
<TE>   "The danger in making these assumptions -- based on profiles -- is
that you divert resources toward things that are more likely
statistically" but are dead ends in the particular case, said Barry
Rosenfeld, a forensic psychologist at Fordham University in New York
speaking about criminal inquiries in general.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, the men were black and drove a blue Chevrolet.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad and Osbourne purchased the former undercover police car
from Sure Shot Auto Sales in Trenton on Sept. 10, according to New
Jersey Department of Motor Vehicles records.</TE>
<TE>   The two men registered it the next day at a Trenton DMV office,
shortly before police evacuated the building because of a bomb scare.</TE>
<TE>   Sure Shot acquired the vehicle for $230 at a public auction
conducted by Bordentown Township on Oct. 6, 2001, according to Mayor
Roselli. The car, which accumulated more than 150,000 miles during
police duty, apparently went unsold for a year before the two men
bought it for $250, according to DMV records. "I'm surprised the
thing even ran," Roselli said. "We usually drive these cars into the
ground."</TE>

<HD>Moms Getting Full Child Support Up 25%</HD>
<DH>Report credits strong economy in late 1990s, stricter
enforcement for boost in compliance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The number of mothers receiving all the child support they were due
increased by more than 25% during the late 1990s, the Census Bureau
reported Friday.</LD>
<LD>   A strong economy and stricter enforcement prompted more fathers to
pay in full, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   More than 2.8 million women collected all the child support they
were owed, representing nearly 46% of all custodial mothers due
payments in 1999. That was up from nearly 2.2 million, or almost 37%
of the mothers owed support in 1993.</LD>
<TE>   The report included other upbeat statistics for mothers raising
children without a father at home. More custodial mothers worked,
fewer lived in poverty and fewer collected public aid during the
six-year period. The welfare overhaul of 1996, which is up for
renewal in Congress, nudged more single mothers off assistance rolls
and into jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Critics noted that the report failed to paint an updated picture
of life for single parents since the economy started to sour in 2000.
"The problem we are seeing now is that so many people are struggling
again," said Geraldine Jensen, president of the Assn. for Children
for Enforcement of Support. "In a lot of ways it makes child support
more important than ever."</TE>
<TE>   The percentage of custodial mothers who received none of the
support due them remained unchanged at 25% from 1993 to 1999, though
tougher enforcement rules were installed midway through that period.</TE>
<TE>   Still, said David Siegal, deputy commissioner for child support
enforcement for the Department of Health and Human Services,
enforcement cases have increased since federal and state governments
began cracking down on deadbeat parents.</TE>
<TE>   The census survey, taken every two years, is the nation's only
estimate of all child support paid and owed across the country,
including private agreements between parents. HHS keeps more recent
figures, but only tracks cases that go through government collections
systems.</TE>
<TE>   Child support enforcement was overhauled in 1996 as part of
welfare reform. Since then there have been other new outreach
initiatives -- such as job search assistance for fathers who cannot
afford to pay support -- that have improved the situation, HHS
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Among custodial fathers, about 248,000 received the full amount of
child support from an absentee mother. That was more than 37% of the
658,000 custodial fathers due money.</TE>

<HD>Paul Wellstone, Fierce Fighter for His Beliefs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Sen. Paul Wellstone, the two-term Minnesota Democrat
who died Friday in a plane crash just days before facing voters in
his quest for reelection, took an unpredictable path toward becoming
one of the best-known, best-liked and most committed liberals on
Capitol Hill.</LD>
<LD>   Born in the capital and raised in its Virginia suburbs, Wellstone
came back to Washington in 1991 as a fist-raising outsider from the
prairie, a rumpled and somewhat radical college professor who had
upset a Republican incumbent with a remarkable populist campaign.</LD>
<LD>   He promised to fight for liberal causes, kick up controversy and
serve just two terms.</LD>
<TE>   He died at age 58 having broken the last of those promises -- by
choosing to seek a third term -- and having softened on the second --
by making so many friends on both sides of the aisle that he was no
longer seen as such a lightning rod.</TE>
<TE>   The erstwhile rabble-rouser, in the end, fit into one of the
world's most exclusive political clubs. He mastered Senate
courtesies, and the Senate mellowed him.</TE>
<TE>   But Wellstone kept his first promise. Lawmakers and analysts from
across the political spectrum said Friday that Wellstone fought
relentlessly, often hopelessly, for what he believed in.</TE>
<TE>   No less an adversary than Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), a stalwart
conservative whom Wellstone had brashly denounced when he first
arrived in the Senate, lauded the Minnesotan on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite the marked contrast between Paul's and my views on
matters of government and politics, he was my friend and I was his,"
Helms said. "He unfailingly represented his views eloquently and
emphatically. Paul Wellstone was a courageous defender of his
beliefs."</TE>
<TE>   Helms, no stranger to fighting hopeless battles, often teamed up
with Wellstone on international human rights issues. In 2000, the two
ideological opposites vigorously fought -- and failed to stop --
President Clinton's legislation to normalize trade relations with the
communist government in China. Wellstone was one of the first to call
this year to check on Helms after the ailing North Carolina senator
had heart surgery.</TE>
<TE>   In a Senate where compromise is valued far more than impassioned
speeches, Wellstone stood out as an advocate more than a legislator.
His was often a lonely dissent -- such as the vote he cast this month
against the resolution granting President Bush authority to make war
against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Wellstone was the only vulnerable Senate Democrat seeking
reelection this year who opposed the president. In explaining his
vote, Wellstone told a Washington Post reporter: "Just putting it in
self-interest terms, how would I have had the enthusiasm and the
fight if I had actually cast a vote I didn't believe in? I couldn't
do that."</TE>
<TE>   But his opposition this year was far more muted than his anti-war
stance in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Then, Wellstone made waves as an uppity freshman senator who
confronted the first President Bush directly on his Persian Gulf War
policy during a White House reception for new lawmakers. The
president, irked, reportedly looked aside and responded with an
expletive.</TE>
<TE>   Wellstone also staged a news conference in front of the Vietnam
War Memorial on the National Mall, drawing the ire of many veteran
groups. Wellstone later said the event was a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   With the two Iraq resolutions serving as bookends to his 12-year
Senate career, in between Wellstone compiled a record of advocacy for
human rights in foreign affairs and higher government spending for
domestic programs, such as health care, welfare and education.</TE>
<TE>   Rarely one to cut deals in committee rooms, Wellstone was known
for pleading his case at length on the Senate floor, even though it
was frequently a lost cause.</TE>
<TE>   Often, those watching a Senate debate could tell when it was about
to end. There would be the 5-foot-5 Wellstone on C-SPAN, giving a
speech, pacing next to his desk with a slight limp, his eyes bulging,
his hands chopping the air.</TE>
<TE>   "He was always the last guy standing with the last amendment,"
said Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.). "It was always about children, or
the poor."</TE>
<TE>   The Senate, almost always, would vote down that Wellstone
amendment, whatever it was, and then finish the bill.</TE>
<TE>   "Paul had a lot of heart, and a lot of passion, and intellect,"
said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). "He occupied the liberal end,
no question. In that sense, he was predictable. But that's a strength
too."</TE>
<TE>   His political alignment -- to the left of just about everyone --
also made him a prime target for Republicans. While Wellstone
followed in the path of liberal Minnesota icons Hubert H. Humphrey
and Walter F. Mondale, both senators who rose to become vice
presidents and presidential nominees, his state also has sent
conservatives to the Senate and elected an independent as governor.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Bush and the Republican Party poured heavy resources
into defeating Wellstone. The Democrat was campaigning vigorously
this year despite his public acknowledgment that he had a mild form
of multiple sclerosis. Polls when he died showed he had a good shot
at beating the Republican nominee, former St. Paul Mayor Norm
Coleman.</TE>
<TE>   Paul David Wellstone was born on July 21, 1944, in Washington, the
second son in a family with Russian Jewish roots. He grew up in a
middle-class neighborhood in Arlington, Va., and went to the
University of North Carolina. There he earned a bachelor's degree in
1965 and a doctorate in political science in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   He also became a champion wrestler, married Sheila Ison (who also
died in Friday's crash at age 58, along with their daughter, Marcia,
33) and, importantly for his political career, was influenced by the
civil rights movement and protests against the Vietnam War. His
dissertation was titled: "Black Militants in the Ghetto: Why They
Believe in Violence."</TE>
<TE>   Wellstone landed on the faculty at Carleton College, a small
liberal arts center in Northfield, Minn., and stayed there for 21
years until his election to the Senate. At Carleton, he took part in
the antiwar movement in the early 1970s and once was arrested while
protesting the U.S. bombing in Cambodia.</TE>
<TE>   As a colleague recalled, Wellstone would push his students to
observe state government and get involved in politics. His
performance in the classroom foreshadowed his style in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw him lecture. It wasn't a lot different from what he did on
the floor of the Senate," said Barbara Allen, chairwoman of political
science at Carleton. "He cajoled, he got his point across, he kidded,
he teased. He was one of the most can-do teachers."</TE>
<TE>   As an activist, Wellstone co-chaired Jesse Jackson's Minnesota
campaign in the 1988 presidential race and volunteered for Michael S.
Dukakis after he became the Democratic nominee.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, he took the state by storm in a guerrilla
campaign against Republican Sen. Rudy Boschwitz.</TE>
<TE>   Two of Wellstone's ads that year became part of political lore. In
one, he crisscrossed the state in an old green bus, spitting out
rapid-fire positions because, he said, "I don't have $6 million to
spend, so I'm going to have to talk fast." In another, Wellstone
stalked an elusive Boschwitz in pursuit of a debate, using a motif
from the quirky documentary "Roger and Me."</TE>
<TE>   He beat Boschwitz, 50% to 48%, in one of the year's biggest
upsets. In 1996, he would beat Boschwitz again with a much
better-funded campaign, 50% to 41%.</TE>
<TE>   Wellstone's voting record in the Senate left little doubt where he
was coming from. He voted for Clinton's plan to raise taxes in 1993
and against the 2001 Bush tax cut. He opposed the North American Free
Trade Agreement in 1993 and opposed fast-track trade legislation this
year. He consistently favored gun control and abortion rights.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, Wellstone worked with Republicans on legislation. He
and Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-N. M.) led an effort to require
insurance companies to treat mental health patients the same as those
who suffer other illnesses. They won passage of one bill in 1996 and
were pushing another, stronger version this year.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Wellstone flirted with a presidential run but dropped the
idea, quipping to Associated Press: "I'm short, I'm Jewish and I'm a
liberal." He later wrote a book, "The Conscience of a Liberal," whose
title echoed a line from Republican Barry Goldwater on his
conservatism.</TE>
<TE>   Wellstone and his wife, Sheila, are survived by their two sons,
David and Mark, and six grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Ironclad's Turret Yields Civil War Artifacts</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scientists exploring the gun turret of the Civil War ironclad
Monitor, recovered just off the coast of North Carolina in August,
have found two skeletons, one with a gold wedding band, the team
said.</LD>
<LD>   They have also recovered several silver spoons and forks. One
bears the name "G. Frederickson," presumably George Frederickson, an
officer from Philadelphia who drowned along with 15 other crew
members when the Monitor sank on Dec. 31, 1862. Another spoon is
engraved "USN," for U.S. Navy, and bears the initials "SAL."</LD>
<LD>   It may have belonged to third assistant engineer Samuel Augee
Lewis, who also was lost in the sinking.</LD>
<TE>   Other artifacts extracted from the nearly 40 tons of silt that
filled the turret include a copper tea kettle, a lantern that
apparently hung in the turret, two bone or ivory knife handles,
fragments of a wool overcoat, a key, coins and a variety of uniform
buttons.</TE>
<TE>   Also found was a hard rubber Goodyear comb, three shoes and a
boot. There were also fragments of a wooden cabinet, and cannon
implements, such as worms, a sponge, rammers, brass and wooden blocks
and coal.</TE>
<TE>   "We are literally digging through an inverted time capsule from
1862," said Mariners' Museum conservator Wayne Lusardi.</TE>
<TE>   "The artifacts are slowly revealing to us and the world what life
was like on one of the most historic naval vessel's in the country's
history."</TE>

Uranus, bringing the number of confirmed Uranian moons to 21.</LD>
<LD>   The moon is tiny -- less than 12 miles across -- and part of a
group of six small moons known as "the Uranian irregulars" because of
their strange, wavy orbits.</LD>
<LD>   The new moon is dwarfed by Uranus' largest moons, Titania and
Oberon, which are more than 900 miles across. The discovery has yet
to receive a name; all other moons of the seventh planet are named
after Shakespearean characters.</LD>

<LD>As worms enter their twilight years, their bodies become wrinkled and
flaccid much like humans' do, according to an exhaustive study of old
age in worms. A team from Rutgers, the State University of New
Jersey, reported in the Oct. 24 Nature that youthful specimens of the
roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans  wriggle around vigorously, but in
midlife (six to seven days) an ominous decline begins. By old age (12
to 18 days) even a needle prod elicits only ineffectual twitches.</LD>
<LD>   The apparent reason: Muscles are decaying, much as human muscles
lose bulk in later years. Also found in worms were thick, wrinkled
hides.</LD>
<LD>   In another worm study in the Oct. 24 Science, UC San Francisco
researchers showed they can double the lifespan of C. elegans by
switching off certain key genes. Inactivating these genes in a worm's
youth gets in the way of reproduction, but doing so in adulthood
avoids this down side, the team said.</LD>
<TE>   "They look great; they're vigorous," said biologist Cynthia
Kenyon, of UCSF.</TE>
