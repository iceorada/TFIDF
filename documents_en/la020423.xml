<HD>'Histories' Unlocks the Past</HD>
<DH>Theater* In a play to be read at South Coast Repertory,
young writer Julia Cho tries to fill gaps in her family's story.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Large pieces of Julia Cho's family past in Korea are missing, and she
concedes they may never be found.</LD>
<LD>   Her play, "99 Histories," is partly a reflection on that loss. It
also is the product of Cho's conviction that in the absence of facts,
the imagination must take over, and that it can suffice.</LD>
<LD>   The play is one of five unproduced works-in-progress that will
have public readings in the annual Pacific Playwrights Festival,
Friday through Sunday at South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa. At 26,
Cho is the youngest writer in a lineup that also includes Pulitzer
Prize-winning veteran Beth Henley and three emerging New York-based
playwrights: Lynn Nottage, Steven Drukman and Julia Jordan.</LD>
<TE>   The protagonist of "99 Histories" is Eunice Kim, a young woman
whose promise as a cello-playing prodigy has been destroyed by the
onset of mental illness. Medication allows her to function more or
less normally, but she has landed back on her mother's doorstep in a
Los Angeles suburb. She is pregnant and alone, haunted by memories of
her father's murder during a robbery of the family's mom-and-pop
convenience store.</TE>
<TE>   None of these circumstances applies to Cho, who lives in Brooklyn
and likes to siphon her material from everywhere. She was born in Los
Angeles and lived in Whittier until she was 12, when her dad's job
transfer took the family to Mesa, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Eunice's blunted creative life, Cho's has moved ahead
promisingly since she began writing plays as a senior at Amherst
College in Massachusetts. Although her works remain unproduced, she
has received commissions for plays from the Mark Taper Forum and
South Coast Repertory.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, she is working under the tutelage of Marsha Norman and
Christopher Durang as a playwriting fellow at the Juilliard School,
and David Henry Hwang, dean of Asian American playwrights, has been
her mentor-consultant for a two-week workshop staging of "99
Histories" that began today as part of the Cherry Lane Alternative's
emerging playwrights program in New York.</TE>
<TE>   If the play's circumstances are not true to Cho's experience, the
issues are. The play unfolds like a puzzle piecing itself together.</TE>
<TE>   Eunice feels a need to know her family's past in Korea in order to
get through the crisis in her present. As the audience watches,
shards of events from her own childhood and that of her immigrant
mother begin to fall into place. But which are real and which only
imagined? At the play's climax, Eunice resorts to a fierce gambit to
wrest buried secrets from her mom.</TE>
<TE>   Cho wouldn't go that far, but she feels the same unfulfilled
hunger for knowledge of her origins.</TE>
<TE>   In her early teens, she read Amy Tan's novel "The Joy Luck Club"
and wondered why her own mother wasn't bursting with illuminating
lore about the old country, as the Chinese American women were in the
book.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to her very righteously and said, 'You never tell me
stories. What was Korea like?'" Cho recalled over the phone recently.
"She was very busy ironing or something, and said, 'We were hungry.'
They were children during the Korean War, and if they don't talk
about it, there's probably a reason for it. I've gotten a little more
respectful of my parents' silences."</TE>
<TE>   Lacking many facts, Cho says, imagined origins are better than
none. "I need to make up something, because without having some sense
of where I'm from, how can I go forward?"</TE>
<TE>   What she can find, she uses. When her brother married a Korean
woman a few years ago, Cho learned about chung, a hard-to-define
Korean concept akin to love. Chung, says Cho, is what exists between
people who are so closely bonded that, for better or worse, each is
essential to the other's achieving full self-hood.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked everyone I knew about it, and without exception, only
Koreans from Korea knew what it was. None of my Korean American
friends had heard about it before." In "99 Histories," chung is an
important motif as mother and daughter try to sort through their
anguished relationship.</TE>
<TE>   Cho has no qualms about her play's ability to translate to a broad
audience: "If you write an immigrant story, it's going to be a
classic American story."</TE>
<TE>   She is interested in writing about characters who are not Korean,
but she also embraces what she sees as a responsibility to write
plays that will provide career-nourishing roles for Asian actors.</TE>
<TE>   Two other plays in progress are "Architecture of Loss," about a
Korean family in Arizona whose child has disappeared, and an untitled
comedy about a part-Asian family living in a trailer home in the
desert. The Taper will offer a free public reading of "Architecture
of Loss" on May 20.</TE>
<TE>   Writer-director Chay Yew, head of the Taper's Asian Theatre
Workshop, directed a previous reading of "99 Histories" under Taper
auspices; he is directing the reading at South Coast as well.</TE>
<TE>   "For a young playwright, [Cho offers] great emotional maturity and
economy of words and a great passion for language," Yew said. "She's
very good at drawing characters who have emotional complexity."</TE>
<TE>   Cho had an emotionally complex moment of her own at the Taper's
reading of "99 Histories" last June. Her parents attended; it was the
first time they had seen a play other than a musical.</TE>
<TE>   "I was terrified. They were supportive of me all those years on
pure faith, and now they would see what they had been supporting."</TE>
<TE>   All went well, without the shock or disapproval Cho had imagined.</TE>
<TE>   "My father was saying, 'Do Americans like this play? It's so
Korean.' What struck him the most was the audience's reaction to it:
'You made people cry.' That amazed him."</TE>
<TE>   "99 Histories," South Coast Repertory, 655 Town Center Drive,
Costa Mesa. Friday, 1 p.m. $8. (714) 708-5555.</TE>

<LD>"The Scorpion King" muscled its way to the top of the charts over the
weekend, grossing $36.1 million to shatter previous April box-office
records. The prior record for a film opening in April was set in 1999
by "Life," a prison comedy starring Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence,
which opened with $20.4 million in ticket sales. "The Matrix,"
however, which technically opened the last day in March 1999, took in
$27.8 million in its first weekend, April 2-4.</LD>
<LD>   The urban thriller "Changing Lanes" dropped to second place,
grossing $11.1 million, while the new Sandra Bullock film, "Murder by
Numbers," opened in third place with $9.3 million.</LD>
<LD>   "The Scorpion King" is the fourth film this year to open with more
than $30 million in box office, joining "Panic Room," "Blade II" and
"Ice Age." Only one film, "Hannibal," had achieved that goal by this
date last year.</LD>

<HD>Aspiring Sitcom Writers Hit the Ultimate Block</HD>
<DH>Television* With few inspiring series on the air, those who
want to pen scripts are trying every trick in the book.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not so long ago, didn't everyone in Los Angeles have a "Seinfeld"
script in a drawer, with that perfect Kramer subplot and an inspired
George Costanza diatribe?</LD>
<LD>   This was in the early and mid-1990s, when it was great to be a
sitcom writer and not so bad, even, to be an aspiring one. Breaking
into the business, or so it seemed, only meant coming up with a good
"Seinfeld" or "Cheers" or "Murphy Brown" or "Mad About You" "spec
script"--that is, a sample episode of an existing show that a writer
would submit to agents and producers to showcase his talents.</LD>
<LD>   For the would-be sitcom writer, the choices were plentiful. In
addition to the aforementioned shows, and the cult biz favorite "The
Larry Sanders Show," there were also established family comedies to
try writing, including "Roseanne," "Grace Under Fire" and "Home
Improvement."</LD>
<TE>   Yet today, in another gauge of how few hit comedies have been
developed in recent years, the pickings are slimmer--so slim that one
of the most popular spec scripts piling up on agents' and producers'
desks nowadays is "Curb Your Enthusiasm," a show that airs on pay
cable and doesn't even have scripted dialogue. The HBO series,
created by and starring "Seinfeld" co-creator Larry David (who plays
"Seinfeld" co-creator Larry David), draws from seven- or eight-page
outlines dreamed up by David, while the actors improvise nearly all
the lines.</TE>
<TE>   And therein lies the paradox: Sitcom writers emulating a show
without sitcom writing.</TE>
<TE>   "They're basically taking a show whose success is based on that
kind of carefully awkward, ad-libbing improv style that makes it seem
like real life, and attempting to refabricate it. Having said that,
it's better than reading the thousandth 'Frasier,'" said Marsh
McCall, a former executive producer on the NBC sitcom "Just Shoot
Me," who recently finished a pilot for CBS starring Nia Vardalos.</TE>
<TE>   In short, if viewers aren't watching newer sitcoms, sensing the
dead air behind the laugh tracks, try writing a spec for one of these
shows. Some aspiring writers have even resorted in recent years to
submitting specs of classic series like "The Mary Tyler Moore Show"
or "The Dick Van Dyke Show"--in effect mirroring the behavior of
those viewers who choose reruns of vintage shows on cable over the
broadcast networks' attempts at the next new thing.</TE>
<TE>   McCall will be plodding through his share of spec scripts if his
pilot gets ordered as a series when the networks announce their new
fall schedules next month, as the annual scramble for writing jobs
gets underway--a three- to four-week process known as "staffing
season."</TE>
<TE>   It is a job fair that can seem half like a lottery and half like
running for student body president. Merit has something to do with
employment, but not everything to do with it. Writers already working
are at a decided advantage because, as McCall noted, "there is really
no substitute for calling someone you trust and saying, 'You spent a
year with this person, how were they?'"</TE>
<TE>   Still, for sitcom writers across the board, job prospects have
gotten tougher, amid a downswing in hit shows and budget cutbacks
that have reduced the number of seats in a writers' room. Meanwhile,
studios have curtailed many of the lucrative development deals that,
three or four years ago, plucked writers from hit shows to develop
sitcoms of their own, creating turnover in the process.</TE>
<TE>   In this environment, connections and credits often carry the day,
but a good "spec script" can still open doors, insist agents, network
executives and producers.</TE>
<TE>   True, there is "Malcolm in the Middle," "Everybody Loves Raymond"
and "The Bernie Mac Show," to name three. But with fewer universally
watched "quality" shows on the air, the process of identifying talent
is more muddled.</TE>
<TE>   "I think someone should write a 'Survivor' spec," McCall quipped.</TE>
<TE>   What "Curb Your Enthusiasm" has that most shows don't, said Lanny
Noveck, co-head of the television literary department at the William
Morris Agency, is a strong following among those producers in a
position to hire new writers. Indeed, while the series isn't a
ratings hit, its milieu practically serves as an autobiography for
the TV industry--featuring as it does the inspired antics of a
successful and neurotic TV writer as he tries to get through the
vagaries of Westside living.</TE>
<TE>   "People in the writing community tend to really respond well to
that show," Noveck said. "You want to be able to have a script that
will speak to as many people as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Or, as others put it, sitcom writers don't actually like most of
what's on TV (including, at times, their own shows). But they do like
"Curb," with its "Seinfeld"-ian predicaments.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're a writer and you want to figure out what shows ...
other people [in the business] watch, pick 'Curb,'" said one TV
agent, declining to be named.</TE>
<TE>   Still, not everyone would give out that advice. Bruce Helford,
executive producer of the ABC sitcoms "The Drew Carey Show" and "The
George Lopez Show," cautions that writing a "Curb" spec "really
doesn't tell producers of these broader-appeal shows what these
writers can do in those situations."</TE>
<TE>   In general, Helford said, "It is a horrible year for finding
writers. The scripts I've read have been unimaginative.... I think
people make one huge mistake. Instead of trying to imitate what they
see, they should be trying to make it better. You've gotta really
love the craft, and I don't get [that] feeling from any of these
writers."</TE>
<TE>   If ABC renews "George Lopez" and Fox picks up "Wanda at Large,"
starring comedian Wanda Sykes, Helford will have three shows on the
air next fall. As he scouts for writers, Helford would rather read
specs of "Malcolm in the Middle," "The Bernie Mac Show" or even the
long-running "The Simpsons." "If anybody dares, I will always read a
'Simpsons,'" he said. "The interaction of the family, the surprising
humor.... You can tell if someone can write jokes if they can write a
'Simpsons.'"</TE>
<TE>   You would not, however, send Helford a spec script of any of the
shows he oversees. According to the way things work, a writer
pursuing a job on "George Lopez," say, would not write a "George
Lopez" spec. First, producers don't want to open themselves up to
accusations of theft. And they tend to be more proprietary and
judgmental when it comes to reading scripts based on their own
series.</TE>
<TE>   So what does that leave? Everybody, it seems, is writing an
"Everybody Loves Raymond." While clever and amusing, HBO's "Sex and
the City," Helford said, "doesn't have any hard-hitting humor." The
series, with its female look at sexual politics, turns off some
executive producers so much they won't even read a spec for the show,
several agents said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, other shows--NBC's "Friends" and "Frasier"--are
considered either too old or serialized to make for a good spec.</TE>
<TE>   "I always say, 'Write your favorite show. Write the one you know
the best, as long as it's not completely obscure or it's only been on
for four episodes,'" said Greg Garcia, co-creator and executive
producer of the CBS' "Yes, Dear."</TE>
<TE>   In his position, Garcia has read a stack of "Raymonds." An
inordinate number of the specs he's read, Garcia said, involve the
Barone kids walking in on Ray and Debra having sex. He's not sure
why.</TE>
<TE>   "People say to me, you must be sick of reading 'Raymonds.' No, I'm
sick of reading bad 'Raymonds,'" said Garcia, who broke into the
business writing a "Friends" and a "Seinfeld."</TE>
<TE>   "Curb" is not reading any specs. David, in production on a third
season, was unavailable for comment. But if you think you've got the
perfect script for a "Curb" or a "Malcolm" or anything else, don't
bother. In case you haven't heard, his show doesn't have writers.</TE>

<HD>Crash, Burn and Rise Again</HD>
<DH>Pop Music* After considering his storied career pretty much
over, Paul Westerberg finds himself in a new album.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD CROMELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not that he's a glutton for punishment, but Paul Westerberg is
back for another round. Whether it ends in more rejection, in
long-overdue glory or, most likely, something in between, one thing's
sure: The days of corporate record business frustration are behind
him. Thanks for the memories.</LD>
<LD>   "I kept waiting for lightning to strike and something magical to
happen with my life that didn't happen," says Westerberg, talking
amiably at a West Hollywood hotel, drinking cappuccino and smoking a
cigar, a notable contrast with what he smoked and drank in his wild
youth.</LD>
<LD>   "On the last record, I knew I wasn't going to tour, and it felt
like the end of something," he says. "Not to get too deep, but it
felt like the end of my musical career, or Chapter 1 was put to a
rest.... I got rid of my lawyer and manager and everyone. It felt
very refreshing to have no one to tell me what to do or to suggest
what to do. I had only myself, and it was as if I was 17 again with a
fresh slate."</LD>
<TE>   It rarely comes to that for artists with the credentials of
Westerberg, who led his star-crossed band the Replacements out of
Minneapolis on a spectacular crash-and-burn career across the 1980s'
post-punk landscape. In an echo of the famous Velvet Underground
syndrome, only a few thousand people bought their records, but it
seemed as if every one of them started a band. Or wrote about the
music. Or played the songs on college radio stations.</TE>
<TE>   It added up to a legend, and Westerberg crawled out of the
wreckage at the start of the '90s as a consensus great American
songwriter and true-cause rock 'n' roll crusader, if a little heavy
on the self-destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Westerberg's resume bulged with lost-generation anthems such as
"Bastards of Young" and the aching introspection of "Here Comes a
Regular" (both from the Replacements' first major-label album,
"Tim"), and fans figured he would get his due on his own.</TE>
<TE>   But despite being in fine form and on his best behavior, he
watched his three big-label albums, first on Sire/Reprise, then
Capitol, die increasingly rapid deaths. By the end, with his 1999
release "Suicane Gratifaction" selling just 52,000 copies, it was
seeming a little futile.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he went through a period where he was kind of questioning
what he was doing and where he stood in the music world after the
disappointment of the last record," says Darren Hill, an old
acquaintance who played bass on Westerberg's first solo tour and
became his manager last year. "But that sort of fueled him to start
recording on his own, and I think the results have encouraged him to
follow his gut at this point."</TE>
<TE>   Those results come out formally today in the form of "Paul
Westerberg Stereo," on the Los Angeles independent label Vagrant
Records. The mostly acoustic collection comes with a bonus disc,
"Mono," a more rocking companion album (under the pseudonym Grandpa
Boy) that Vagrant originally released in a limited edition in
February.</TE>
<TE>   Whether soft-boiled or hard-edged, Westerberg's music retains its
signature melodic breeziness and effortless rise-and-fall shape. In
his sometimes tough, sometimes tender character sketches and
diary-like observations, he's again a voice of reassurance for those
who have a hard time finding a place to fit in the world.</TE>
<TE>   The difference is the records' casual, intimate, spontaneous
nature, reflecting their pressure-free creation in Westerberg's home
studio in Minneapolis. The sound is unvarnished, and a couple of
songs simply end in mid-verse.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's what gives it character. We are putting out what
he turned in," says Vagrant owner Rich Egan, whose label is stocked
with young bands that are artistically indebted to Westerberg.</TE>
<TE>   "All those quote-unquote glitches, I think, are what make the
record. It's a really grounded, homespun, honest record. Like the
song that just stops, it's because the tape ran out. He was gonna
play till the tape ran out, and that's what he did. It definitely
sounds like it's lacking some big corporate ax hanging over his
head."</TE>
<TE>   "The first reason I ever did it was for fun and my own
entertainment, and it's come full circle," says Westerberg, who's
extending that spirit with his album-launch tour, a series of free,
fan-friendly solo performances in record stores, including Amoeba
Music in Hollywood on Thursday. (He'll probably come back later with
a band.)</TE>
<TE>   Famously reclusive and sometimes agoraphobic, still fighting his
two longtime nemeses, anxiety and depression, Westerberg, 42,
nonetheless seems comfortable as he sits in the hotel's dining patio
overlooking the pool and a sweeping city view. He says he was in bed
at 9 the night before, and the next morning he'll be flying home to
his wife and 3-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to be back. It is, actually. I'm a lot more relaxed
this time around and not as caught up in it. I'm older and I know
better.... I liked the notion of going to a label where there was a
fresh enthusiasm rather than maybe a tired aspect of what Paul used
to be, as opposed to what he's gonna be."</TE>
<TE>   What's he gonna be? He may be a Replacement again, for a while, if
longtime guitar sidekick Tommy Stinson can free up time from the
never-ending recording sessions of his current group, Guns 'N Roses,
to tour with his old band-mate. What he's not about to be again is a
great hope that didn't deliver.</TE>
<TE>   "Did I feel bitter? Worthless? Yeah, yeah," Westerberg says,
recalling the darker days. "I blamed everyone, I blamed myself. Then
I looked through my record collection, all the things that I like
that never sold any records. How many records did Mott the Hoople
ever sell? I still listen to that.</TE>
<TE>   "Who sells 9 million records and why? Is it because it's good?
They sell records because they put the muscle behind them to make
money. I'll make their money back tenfold, but it'll take 10 years.
I'm not a cash cow that'll be gone tomorrow."</TE>

<HD>L.A. Master Chorale Presents Madrigals for Spring Afternoon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD S. GINELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When USC's Donald Crockett presented Los Angeles Master Chorale music
director Grant Gershon with two newly composed madrigals under the
title "Broken Charms," Gershon ran with the idea and designed an
entire program around them. Hence "Magnificent Madrigals," at Royce
Hall on Sunday afternoon, where "Broken Charms" (a world premiere)
and Frank Martin's "Songs of Ariel" (1950) provided contemporary
anchors for three thematically matched sets of artifacts from the
madrigal's heyday.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, Crockett's pair of a cappella pieces--with texts by
Elizabethan poets Samuel Daniel and Thomas Campion--were well worth
showcasing, for they play with sound in a strikingly emotional way.
The setting of Daniel's "Care-Charmer Sleep" establishes its base in
the lower male voices with splendidly dark contemporary harmonies.
Campion's "Thrice Toss These Oaken Ashes in the Air" is underlined by
drones of humming voices while others seem to simulate chimes,
building to a delicious near-cacophony of thick moving chords toward
the close.</LD>
<TE>   With the season in mind--and half-joking apologies from Gershon
for keeping the audience indoors on a beautiful spring day--the
English and Italian madrigals were gathered under the titles "Spring
Has Sprung," "Variable Love" and "Feathered Friend." Because the
early music movement usually has exclusive custody of Renaissance
music these days, it was a welcome shock to hear a robust symphonic
choir applying its powerhouse sound and exquisitely modulated
dynamics to this material.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly effective was the bird set, with the serenely gliding
swans of Jacob Arcadelt and Orlando Gibbons and Monteverdi's
cascading "That Little Bird That Sings So Sweetly." In this context,
Martin's "Songs of Ariel," based on texts from Shakespeare's "The
Tempest," seemed like a continuation of the Renaissance composers'
tone-paintings, but with a more acerbic 20th century accent.</TE>

<HD>The Scoop on Army</HD>
<DH>Bucking the instant gossip of the Internet Age, Archerd
still plays by his own rules.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK GOLDSTEIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I'd barely been in Army Archerd's cozy corner office at Variety for
an hour, watching him put his column together, when he interrupted an
anecdote featuring his old pal Mike Wallace to sound off on a more
important subject--his age. It seems that some media outlets have
been publishing an inflated number, putting Archerd's age at 83.</LD>
<LD>   "My correct age happens to be 80," Army reports, saying it again
slowly and distinctly so I get it right. "Eight-O." When I tease him
that even his Variety co-workers have suggested a higher figure, he
calls my bluff. "Want to see my driver's license?" Seconds later, he
tosses his license across the desk. The Archerd birth date is right
there in black type: 1-13-22.</LD>
<LD>   "I think people get confused because Bob Stack and I have the same
birthday, which we celebrate together every year," Army explains.
"But he's two years older and always has been. So just for accuracy,
it would be nice if you could get it right."</LD>
<TE>   Getting it right is a big deal with Archerd, who's been writing
his "Just for Variety" column for nearly half a century. There are
columnists who unearth juicier gossip and have better pipelines to
the latest It Girl. But when it comes to getting it right, no one is
in the same ballpark. The Dodgers have Vin Scully. The Lakers have
Chick Hearn. And Hollywood has Army Archerd, who has his own star on
Hollywood Boulevard and has served as the academy's official Oscar
night celebrity greeter for 44 years. (On the wall of his office,
Archerd has a framed copy of an Entertainment Weekly illustration of
this year's Oscar red carpet layout, where a spot near the Kodak
Theatre entrance is billed as "Army's Station.")</TE>
<TE>   Archerd has known Bob Hope since Army worked in the mailroom at
Paramount Pictures in the early 1940s. He was at Elizabeth Taylor's
first wedding to hotelier Nicky Hilton. He had political debates till
the wee hours with John Wayne. After hearing a young Barbra Streisand
sing in the '60s, he wrote her up in the column, declaring that "a
star is born." Madonna sat on his lap at one of Swifty Lazar's Oscar
parties. "Of course," Archerd allows, "that's because I was sitting
next to Warren Beatty."</TE>
<TE>   "Army is one of a kind," says longtime Hollywood publicist Stan
Rosenfield, whose clients include Will Smith and George Clooney. "He
has power and credibility because he's never mean-spirited and he
writes truthful stories. If something is in Army's column, you know
it happened."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood math being what it is, Archerd is being honored Saturday
at the Beverly Hilton Hotel for "the start of his 50th year with
Variety," even though most statisticians would call it a 49th
anniversary celebration. The industry's old guard will be out in
force for the event, a charity benefit for the Kayne-Eras Center, an
educational facility for developmentally impaired children and
adults. In a town that relentlessly pursues youthful trends and fresh
stars, Army's column is a cozy throwback to a bygone era.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Hecht once said that Walter Winchell wrote "like a man honking
in a traffic jam." Army's rhythms are more sedate. Reading his
reassuring prose is like listening to big-band music or having a bowl
of Canter's matzo ball soup.</TE>
<TE>   In an era in which gossip columnists are frequently overshadowed
by the 24-hour babble of celebrity coverage on the Internet and cable
TV networks like E!, Archerd's column is a fixture, dating back to
1953, when the big movie in town was "From Here to Eternity" and the
jukebox hit was Patti Page's "Doggie in the Window."</TE>
<TE>   When Army arrived in Hollywood after serving in the Navy during
World War II, America's obsession with celebrities and gossip had
been in full swing for decades. Winchell's column debuted at the New
York Graphic in 1924, at roughly the same time that Louella Parsons
was emerging as the queen of gossip for the Hearst papers in
Hollywood. Frankly, little has changed in the seven decades that
followed.</TE>
<TE>   One of Winchell's earliest items, that John Barrymore had taken
the pledge to give up drinking--and wound up drunk the next
night--would fit neatly in any of today's leading columns, be it Liz
Smith, Rush &amp; Malloy or Page Six, which reported just the other day
that young actress Tara Reid had been seen "guzzling booze" at a New
York club. The Internet has sped the dissemination of news and
gossip, and occasionally introduced a new wrinkle like Harry Knowles'
Ain't It Cool News, a Web site devoted to film-geek gossip about test
screenings of movies.</TE>
<TE>   But the rules of the gossip game are basically the same. "It's
always who's sleeping with who, who's getting drunk and who's hanging
out at what club," says Marc Malkin, who writes New York magazine's
Intelligencer column. "The only difference is that the names change."
When Army was starting out, the big story was Frank Sinatra breaking
up with Ava Gardner. Today it's Britney Spears dumping Justin
Timberlake.</TE>
<TE>   Archerd is an old-school celebrity chronicler: no blind items or
quotes from "friends" or "spies." With his sleeves rolled up to his
elbows, he cranks out a 75-line column four days a week, doing his
own reporting and legwork, scribbling notes on yellow 5-by-7 scraps
of paper. He eats lunch at his desk. "The truck goes by and they
throw me a taco," is how he puts it.</TE>
<TE>   Archerd works the telephone from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., when he files
the column in time to make Variety's New York edition. He writes a
classic "three dot" column, a series of generally upbeat items
separated by dots, focusing on celebrities' work and charitable
activities, rarely delving into stickier personal topics. When he
wants to call a celebrity, Archerd rummages through three desk
drawers packed with a collection of star and publicist phone numbers
that would be the envy of any CIA agent.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been doing this for 25 years, and I still gulp when I call
Army," says Larry Solters, a veteran music business publicist. "He's
the professor. You have to be really prepared when he gets on the
phone, because he always knows more about your client than you do."</TE>
<TE>   Army's most famous scoop came in 1985, when he broke the news that
Rock Hudson had AIDS. It was written in classic Archerd fashion, with
Army appealing to the better instincts of the Hollywood community:
"The whispering campaign on Rock Hudson can and should stop." As with
most Archerd items, it was written from the inside out, with Army
explaining that Hudson's illness "was no secret to close Hollywood
friends, but its true nature was divulged to very, very few." He
concluded the item with a prescient warning: "Doctors warn that the
dread disease is going to reach catastrophic proportions in all
communities if a cure is not soon found."</TE>
<TE>   He rarely editorializes, but when he does it gets the industry's
attention. In 1996, Archerd gently rebuked Marlon Brando for telling
Larry King that "the Jews run Hollywood, and that's why minorities
are treated the way they are." Several years later he was openly
critical of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for
giving a lifetime achievement award to Elia Kazan, who'd informed on
his friends during the 1950s Red Scare.</TE>
<TE>   He regularly gets unique inside access. When the academy's awards
review committee recently held its first post-Oscar meeting, Archerd
got everyone on the phone--and in his column--before they even met.
Army didn't voice his own opinion, but after hearing nearly everyone
bluntly admit that the show went on too long, readers came away
believing things will be markedly different next year.</TE>
<TE>   Archerd has a suspiciously full head of neatly combed gray hair,
his long, slender hands are wrinkle-free, and he has the energy of
someone half his age. After Milton Berle died last month, Archerd
attended the funeral, banged out a column at his home in Westwood and
faxed it to Variety. Whenever he picks up the phone, people get an
effusive greeting: "honey" for the women, "kiddo" for the men. When
he talks to dancer Ann Miller, he wishes her a happy birthday, then
asks, "Should I say how old you are?" (The next day's column
generously lists her as 79.)</TE>
<TE>   "Just for Variety" is not where you go to read about phenoms. The
column often reads like a travel itinerary for an AARP cruise-ship
vacation, with Esther Williams going to Vegas, Red Buttons "winging
in" from Toronto, Mel Brooks "on a plane" to be with his wife, Anne
Bancroft, and Paul Newman "arriving in Lake Hughes" for one of the
star's many charity ventures.</TE>
<TE>   Still, publicist Bumble Ward, who reps a stable of young
filmmakers, says an Archerd plug still counts. "For a young
director," she says, "if you make his column there's a feeling that
you've made it." As Army puts it: "I'm not just interested in alte
kockers [Yiddish for "old people"]. I was just trying to run
something down about Leo DiCaprio."</TE>
<TE>   He recently led the column with a Halle Berry interview, tracking
her down in Spain where she's filming a new James Bond film. Cradling
the phone on his shoulder, Archerd expertly pumped her about the Bond
film ("You don't have to disrobe again?") and her recent Oscar win
("What has Oscar meant to you in terms of offers or asking price?").</TE>
<TE>   Each day he worries that the phone will stop ringing and his
sources will dry up. When I was in his office, I asked him at midday
how much of the column he had written. He pointed to the computer
screen. All it said was, "Good Morning," his customary opener.
"That's all I got," he said. "The rest is spelled F-E-A-R. I'm always
thinking, 'Where is the news lurking? Who can I call?'" He shrugs.
"There are days where I shvitz [sweat] a lot."</TE>
<TE>   When I leave, Army says, "You didn't ask whether I was retiring.
That's what everybody asks." I told him it hardly seemed likely. He
nodded and said, "You got that right."</TE>

<LD>Fado, the soulful music of Portugal, has been likened to the blues,
to tango, to flamenco, to the rebetika of Greece. And the
similarities are valid, to the extent that each genre represents a
music that has been transformed from the language of the streets into
a rich, aesthetic expression.</LD>
<LD>   In the case of fado, that expression is tinged with the inherently
dramatic concept of saudade, usually described as a combination of
longing, sadness and sorrow. All those qualities, and much more, are
present in the voice of Mariza, a 26-year-old Portuguese singer who
is rapidly emerging as one of the music's bright new stars.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday at the Conga Room, accompanied by a traditional ensemble
of Portuguese guitar, classical guitar and string bass, Mariza gave a
stunning performance. Singing for a fervently enthusiastic audience,
she presented a program ranging from such classic fado numbers as
"Primavera" and "Senhor Vinho" to the newly composed (by guitarist
Jorge Fernando ) "Oxalaa."</LD>
<TE>   Mariza did not hesitate to move past traditional styles. Rejecting
the familiar black garb, she performed in a gown with a voluminous
skirt of colorful, tapestry-like fabric. Enhancing her already great
height with spike heels, she was an impressive sight, a long, slender
figure with willowy arms and close-cropped blond hair cut in
overlapping waves.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the music that mattered the most. Mariza is a mature
artist for someone still in her mid-20s, fully in command of a rich
array of vocal timbres and a subtle sense of theatrical timing.
Whether singing traditional numbers or new songs, she remained firmly
in touch with the fado roots while spreading her own newly blossoming
creative interpretations.</TE>

<LD>   Stone's Recuperation Capped by Oscar Twirl</LD>
<LD>   Sharon Stone says it may have been a variety of factors, over
time, that led to her being hospitalized last year for bleeding
caused by a tear in an artery at the base of her skull.</LD>
<TE>   "We think it's possible that it was an injury from a horseback
riding accident, made worse by chiropractic adjustments," the actress
told USA Today. "And we think [the 1998 sci-fi movie] 'Sphere'--when
I wore that heavy diving gear--really agitated things."</TE>
<TE>   Though Stone, 44, still gets headaches, doctors have given her a
clean bill of health. Dancing with John Travolta at last month's
Oscar ceremony, she says, was a perfect chance to demonstrate the
distance she's traveled.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people didn't know if I could walk or talk, let alone
dance," she said. "So to let the Emperor Travolta twirl me was
perfect. People were, 'Hey, she walks, she talks, she twirls.' It was
a sweet, lovely way to come back."</TE>

<TE>   Foul Play Not Suspected in Singer Staley's Death</TE>
<TE>   Heroin paraphernalia was found next to the body of Layne Staley,
the singer of the grunge rock group Alice in Chains, Seattle police
said. Foul play is not suspected in his death and there will be no
criminal investigation, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Staley, 34, lay dead in his north Seattle apartment for two weeks
before a relative discovered him. An autopsy was conducted but the
cause of death won't be confirmed for weeks because toxin tests are
being conducted.</TE>
<TE>   "There was nothing suspicious about the death. It appears to be
overdose or possibly a natural death," police spokesman Duane Fish
said.</TE>
<TE>   Alice in Chains was in limbo by 1995 as Staley fell deeper into
addiction. He spoke of making a comeback, but the band never again
launched a major tour.</TE>
<TE>   Some 100 friends and fans held a candlelight vigil at the Seattle
Center on Saturday. And his band issued a statement:</TE>
<TE>   "Yesterday, we all managed to come together in Seattle; it's good
to be with friends and family as we struggle to deal with this
immense loss ... and try to celebrate this immense life. We are
looking for all the usual things: comfort, purpose, answers,
something to hold on to, a way to let him go in peace."</TE>

<TE>   Oxygen Breathing Despite Anemic Ratings</TE>
<TE>   The female-focused cable TV network Oxygen got its first ratings
feedback Monday, and the news wasn't good.</TE>
<TE>   According to Nielsen Media Research data from March, the
2-year-old network drew an average of only about 63,000 people during
prime time in March. In contrast, its main competitor, Lifetime,
pulled in 2.4 million during the same time period.</TE>
<TE>   After a rocky start with carriers, Oxygen is now available in 40
million of the country's 100 million households. Executives say the
network is proceeding full-speed ahead, despite Monday's Nielsen
report.</TE>
<TE>   Rukeyser, on CNBC, Loses to Old PBS Show</TE>
<TE>   Even without longtime host Louis Rukeyser, PBS' "Wall Street Week"
drew more viewers Friday than Rukeyser's new show on cable's CNBC.</TE>
<TE>   The two went head to head Friday for the first time since Rukeyser
was fired from his PBS program for on-air complaints about plans to
diminish his role.</TE>
<TE>   PBS drew an average 935,700 viewers Friday versus 609,000 who
watched Rukeyser on the first airing on CNBC (the program was
repeated later that night). Still, that was substantially less than
the 1.74 million people who tuned in on average to PBS this season.
CNBC, for its part, almost tripled its numbers.</TE>

<TE>   AIDS Memorial Moves Closer to Reality</TE>
<TE>   After a year-long redesign to address layout and design concerns,
"The Wall--Las Memorias Project," has won unanimous approval from the
Los Angeles City Cultural Affairs Commission.</TE>
<TE>   In a public hearing last week, Eddie Martinez, associate director
of the project, said he'd received more than 1,500 letters of support
from the Lincoln Park community in northeast Los Angeles, the site of
the proposed AIDS memorial.</TE>
<TE>   The monument is shaped in the likeness of Quetzalcoatl, a
feathered serpent that is the Aztec God of Hope. It will contain
eight wall panels, six with painted murals and two containing names
of people who have died of AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   The next step: seeking approval from the Recreation and Parks
Commission, which must approve the location before construction can
begin.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   FX has ordered 13 more episodes of its cop series "The Shield,"
which has generated controversy for its grittiness and harsh
language.... A memorial for Peter Hemmings, founding general director
of Los Angeles Opera, will be held at All Saints Episcopal Church in
Pasadena on May 3 at 6:30 p.m..... Phylicia Rashad will reprise her
role in the West Coast premiere of the New York hit comedy "Blue" at
the Pasadena Playhouse Aug. 30-Oct. 13. Also at the theater: Bruno
Kirby will direct Kenneth Lonergan's "The Waverly Gallery" June 28

<HD>When Dvorak Discovered the New World</HD>
<DH>The Pacific Symphony reexplores the Czech composer's
inspirational encounter with America.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pacific Symphony's American music festivals are quickly becoming a
significant, signature achievement in the Southland. With their
intimacy and interactive format, the two central chamber music
programs offer special opportunities for rewards and insights.</LD>
<LD>   Before the Dvorak in America Festival, which ends with an
orchestra program Wednesday and Thursday at the Orange County
Performing Arts Center, it was easy to regard Dvorak's three-year
sojourn in the United States in a superficial and inaccurate way: He
came over for money, grew homesick, went home to Bohemia.</LD>
<LD>   Not quite. He came in 1892 at the invitation of Jeannette Thurber,
a visionary educator who wanted him to help in her project of
creating a national school of American music. He loved the idea. He
found music here that profoundly influenced him, and in turn he
inspired hundreds of American composers to pursue Thurber's project.</LD>
<TE>   Arguably his three greatest works were written during this time:
the "New World" Symphony, the "American" String Quartet and the Cello
Concerto in D minor.</TE>
<TE>   The guiding force behind the festival is Joseph Horowitz, who
offered low-key, urbane, knowledgeable introductions and commentary
in the course of the two weekend programs in Founders Hall at the
center. Saturday afternoon, the topic was "Dvorak and the American
Indian"; Sunday evening, it was "Dvorak and Plantation Song."</TE>
<TE>   Both halves of the afternoon program opened with Benjamin Hale's
splendid Eagle Spirit Dancers performing authentic dances and songs
that could have wowed Dvorak in the touring shows he saw while he was
here. (He already was a fan of Longfellow's "The Song of Hiawatha,"
having read it in Czech and later in English. He planned a "Hiawatha"
opera, which never materialized, but the Scherzo of the "New World"
Symphony depicts, he said, a scene from Longfellow's poem.)</TE>
<TE>   The influence of Indian music in the Thurber-Dvorak project was
then traced through works of the Czech master, Americans Charles
Wakefield Cadman and Arthur Farwell, and German Ferruccio Busoni.</TE>
<TE>   Each composer filtered the influence in a different way, from
Cadman's audience-friendly art music idealizations to Busoni's
mystical, sometimes proto-Copland flights, to Farwell's bold, clear
marriage of Impressionism with what would emerge as the Broadway
style of Rodgers and Hammerstein. Amazing stuff.</TE>
<TE>   Far from feeling indignant at Indian culture's being expropriated
and exploited, Navajo Ben Hale said in the discussion that followed,
"a lot [of Indians] would find it humorous because of the different
instruments--piano and violin--instead of rattle, drum and flute,
which come from the world around us, Mother Nature. It just goes off
in a different way."</TE>
<TE>   The accomplished and exciting musicians were violinist Paul
Manaster, pianist Robert Thies, baritone James Martin Schaefer
(accompanied by Grant Rohan) and the a cappella California State
University Fullerton Chorus led by John Alexander. The singers
invented the gripping, iconic gestures they used in Farwell's "Navajo
War Dance."</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, Michael Beckman, a lively and engaging Dvorak scholar at
UC Santa Barbara, used musical examples to demolish the composer's
claim that he invented rather than borrowed thematic material for his
American works. But he did this playfully, arguing that the borrowing
could have been unconscious and that composers do this kind of thing
all the time.</TE>
<TE>   Still, those of us in the audience will never hear Dvorak's music
the same way again.</TE>
<TE>   The principal strings of the orchestra--concertmaster Raymond
Kobler, violinist Zakarias Grafilo, violist Robert Becker and cellist
Timothy Landauer--played the "American" String Quartet with fervor
and sweetness and brought freshness and epic seriousness to the final
two movements of George Chadwick's Quartet No. 4 (inspired by the
"American" and, when written, in 1896, attacked as being too much
influenced by "the negrophile" Dvorak).</TE>
<TE>   The accomplished and versatile Thies, whom Horowitz justifiably
called "the workhorse of the festival," played works by Scott Joplin
(Dvorak was a fan of the cakewalk), Dvorak and Art Tatum (a version
of Dvorak's famous Humoresque No. 7--the one everyone knows from
cartoons and parodies), with style and aplomb. Baritone Carver Cossey
sang two spirituals (arranged by African American Harry Burleigh,
Dvorak's personal assistant in the States) and William Arms Fisher's
words set to "Goin' Home" with deep feeling.</TE>
<TE>   Although the issue of composers creating a national American style
is "still a vexing question," as Horowitz said, the festival has
definitely shown that Dvorak must figure into the center of any
answer.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Symphony's Dvorak in America Festival continues
Wednesday and Thursday, 8 p.m., Orange County Performing Arts Center,
600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. $21-$56. (714) 556-2787.</TE>

<HD>Ideas for Accessorizing Disney Hall</HD>
<DH>Art* Its architect says he has hopes for works by the
Oldenburg-Van Bruggen team and Richard Serra.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How do you dress up a curvaceous concert hall with stainless-steel
skin?</LD>
<LD>   The answer, among those choosing public artwork for downtown's
Walt Disney Concert Hall, may be a king-sized white collar and bow
tie, along with a tall pair of abstract steel sculptures.</LD>
<LD>   With the concert hall's fall 2003 opening date still more than a
year away, officials at the Music Center, the Los Angeles
Philharmonic and the offices of architect Frank O. Gehry stress that
no final decisions have been made on the landmark building's public
art and that money for the projects is uncertain.</LD>
<TE>   But at a symposium on Disney Hall on Saturday, Gehry told a full
auditorium at the Getty Center that he has high hopes for works by
sculptors Richard Serra and the husband-and-wife team of Claes
Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen and that planners already have sites
in mind.</TE>
<TE>   Though the architect didn't go into detail Saturday, Gehry
spokesman Keith Mendenhall said Monday that the contribution under
discussion from Oldenburg and Van Bruggen is a giant white collar and
bow tie, perhaps 25 feet high, that would be placed near the
building's entrance at Grand Avenue and 1st Street. Mendenhall added
that "we've been talking about Oldenburg [and Van Bruggen] for quite
a long time," and that the artists have already executed a model of
the work.</TE>
<TE>   Oldenburg, born in Sweden and raised in the U.S., is most widely
known for his works magnifying familiar household shapes to epic
scale. In 1991, Oldenburg and his wife, Dutch sculptor and curator
Van Bruggen, collaborated with Gehry on the outsized pair of black
binoculars that form the entrance to the building on Main Street in
Venice that once served as offices of the Chiat-Day advertising firm.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed Serra contribution, which Mendenhall said is a more
recent addition, would be a pair of 45-foot-high works made of
Cor-Ten steel, to be placed along the Grand Avenue side of the hall.</TE>
<TE>   Serra, widely known as a creator of large works of steel and lead,
often for public places, is a longtime friend of Gehry and is the
creator of a major installation inside Gehry's Guggenheim Museum
Bilbao.</TE>
<TE>   Titled "Snake," the Serra work at Bilbao weighs 174 tons and
measures 13 feet high and 104 feet long--an interior complement to
the building's curving titanium exterior. Gehry has credited Serra
for introducing him to the town of Bilbao, before the Guggenheim
museum had any plans to build there, and Serra has borrowed Gehry's
computer design system.</TE>
<TE>   Though Gehry is friendly with all three of the proposed artists,
Mendenhall said, "typically, when it comes to placement of art, we
aren't very directly involved. Usually our clients come up with it
and present it to us after the fact. Certainly Frank advised, but
it's possible that he wasn't the source."</TE>
<TE>   Still open, however, are questions about approving and paying for
the artworks. A spokeswoman for the Music Center said that
organization is creating an art committee to look more closely at
issues of choosing and paying for art at the site. The money to pay
for it will be raised outside the hall's $274-million budget.</TE>
<TE>   "We will have to figure out how to raise that money," said
Catherine Babcock, director of marketing and communications for the
Music Center. There is no estimate for what such works will cost, she
said, adding that the proposals remain in a "conceptual discussion
phase."</TE>

<HD>Is There a Secret in the Bach Partita?</HD>
<DH>The Hilliard Ensemble and violinist Christoph Poppen,
compelling performers, explore the notion that the composer left a
message about his first wife's death.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his new novel, "Gould's Book of Fish," Tasmanian writer Richard
Flanagan memorably labels Vivaldi's "The Four Seasons" as "that vile
anthem of contemporary retailing." Is Bach's Partita in D Minor for
solo violin, with its extraordinary chaconne movement at the end,
next in line to subliminally convince shoppers about the quality of
high-end goods? Played in a pretentious restaurant, perhaps the
partita might now put diners in the mood to order the older pinot
noir.</LD>
<LD>   That seems the fate of the very curious musicological sleight of
hand that pits some of Bach's death-haunted chorales with the D-Minor
Partita. The somber ECM recording "Morimur" by the Hilliard Ensemble
and violinist Christoph Poppen, based upon arcane new Bach research,
has been jostling with trivial crossover bestsellers on the Billboard
classical charts for the last 29 weeks, at one point climbing as high
as No. 4. It has become this season's background music of choice for
quiet reflection, Sunday brunch and nosing around expensive antiques.</LD>
<TE>   Even so, it is hard to entirely dismiss the "Morimur" phenomenon
as simply a mindless musicological gimmick, which, in part, attempts
to find a secret program in the partita that relates it to the Latin
phrase "In Christo morimur" (we die in Christ). The music remains
great. The performers are compelling. And heard live Sunday evening
at UCLA's Schoenberg Hall, where Hilliard and Poppen began their
"Morimur" tour, it was quite beautiful.</TE>
<TE>   The thinking behind the project, as I understand it from the
muddled notes on the recording (which were reprinted in the program),
is that Bach had the death of his first wife, Maria Barbara, in mind
when he wrote the D-Minor Partita. And the composer, ever fascinated
with numerology, left hidden codes about death in the partita that
relate it to certain chorales found in his cantatas and passions.</TE>
<TE>   To emphasize these findings, German musicologist Helga Thoene has
extracted fragments of chorale melody here and there and elastically
altered the rhythms so that they might be sung along with the
chaconne movement.</TE>
<TE>   But once you begin the numbers game with Bach's music, you can
find just about anything you look for if you are clever enough. And
if you allow yourself enough flexibility, the laws of counterpoint
will help you fit the most surprising things together. P.D.Q. Bach
has made a wonderful career out of doing just that.</TE>
<TE>   Bach, of course, may well have been mourning his wife while he
wrote the D-Minor Partita, and it is not unbelievable that bits of
the chorale melodies were consciously or subconsciously floating
about in his head at the time. But he left the music to speak for
itself, and it has for centuries, in a wide variety of contexts.
Would Ferruccio Busoni, for instance, have felt quite so entitled to
make his magnificent virtuosic piano transcription of the chaconne if
he had had to worry about such emotionally confining hidden subtexts?
When it is not Bach but a manipulative musicologist telling us what
to think, she limits, not expands, our horizons.</TE>
<TE>   The performers take a peculiar middle ground in all this. Three of
the four men in the Hilliard Ensemble, joined by soprano Monika
Mauch, sing "relevant" chorales between movements of the first four
movements of the partita, then they all come together for the
chaconne. Just how relevant these chorales are, however, is not
spelled out. No texts are offered, and even the sources of the
chorales are not specifically identified (Bach often reused the same
chorales, with different harmonizations, in his cantatas and
passions). After spending some time with a chorale book and the
recording, identifying the sources, I found myself no further
enlightened and quit.</TE>
<TE>   In live performance, the Hilliard and Poppen are unrelievedly
solemn in demeanor--the violinist grim as a mortician on stage. Yet
they are flamboyant interpreters. The singers brought an interpretive
character and expressivity to the chorales that is rare and winning.
However stiff and expressionless he stood, Poppen played with a
dramatic urgency in which early music performance practice verged on
Romantic excess. And however dubious Thoene's musicology, she has
talent as a composer, because on purely musical terms the descant she
adds to the chaconne works.</TE>
<TE>   It was not, however, so easy to overlook the pretense of the first
half of the program, "Revelations." Here the four men of the ensemble
mixed Renaissance music by Nicolas Gombert and Jacquet de Mantua with
new pieces by Joanne Metcalf and Karen Thomas, which were a kind of
ye olde musick with added dissonances. The plan was to extract from
religious allegory an erotic revelation or two on the name Maria.
That didn't happen, but the singing, at least, was stunning.</TE>

<HD>In Search of 'Real Scorpion King'</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most moviegoers know the Scorpion King only as the sword-wielding
hero who captured the movie box office last weekend, but many
Egyptologists now believe that there was a real Scorpion King. And
chances are he bore no resemblance to the muscle-bound character
played by WWF wrestler Dwayne "the Rock" Johnson in the film that
opened Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight at 9, the History Channel reveals "The Real Scorpion King"
in a two-hour documentary that lays out evidence of the ancient
monarch's existence.</LD>
<LD>   There is no swordplay, no back flips and no flaming arrows in "The
Real Scorpion King," just a view of the exhaustive treks through
desert caves and ancient ruins for traces of the ancient king. The
program doesn't depend on cinematic views of the usual
suspects--pyramids, mummies and temples--it examines the facts, or
more specifically, the carved artifacts: the Scorpion Mace, bone and
ivory tags, and the Scorpion Tableau.</LD>
<TE>   The documentary mixes footage of the Egyptian desert with
commentary from Egyptologists Zahi Hawass, Salima Ikram, John Coleman
Darnell and others, who agree that King Scorpion not only may have
been responsible for the unification of Upper Egypt but also may have
had a hand in the development of the first pictographic writing
system. And the design of his tomb may have inspired the pyramids.</TE>
<TE>   The program is interesting but could have spent less time on
speculation. Adding to the bloat is an introduction by the Rock and,
toward the end, some shameless promotion of the movie.</TE>
<TE>   But the Rock can be forgiven because he makes the program's only
reference to the fact that the archeological evidence may suggest the
existence of at least two rulers who used the name King Scorpion.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the History Channel is waiting for "The Scorpion King"
sequel to delve into the many unresolved mysteries.</TE>

<HD>Having a Spiritual Encounter With Pulitzer Prize-Winner
Henry Brant</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With composer Henry Brant's spatial music, "being there" is central
to the art.</LD>
<LD>   That was an unstated message when his piece "Prophets" was given
its U.S. premiere in Santa Barbara's First Methodist Church on
Sunday. Listeners were literally surrounded by music, treated to the
engaging, enigmatic sound of four cantors singing Old Testament texts
in Hebrew in separate corners of the chapel, while the ceremonial
Jewish horn called the shofar  punctuated their incantations.</LD>
<LD>   It was a special occasion for more than just sonic reasons. It was
the first performance by the Santa Barbara-based Brant since the
composer, at age 88, rose out of cult status to a more general
celebrity by winning the Pulitzer Prize for composition earlier this
month.</LD>
<TE>   Even without the Pulitzer, this has been a gleaming season for
Brant. The prize-winning "Ice Fields" was premiered by the San
Francisco Symphony in December; he conducted his chamber work
"Glossary" in a recent Green Umbrella concert in Los Angeles; and he
will also be composer-in-residence at next month's UC Santa Barbara
New Music Festival.</TE>
<TE>   Ostensibly, the main event of Sunday's program, presented
collaboratively by the First Methodist Church and Santa Barbara's
Congregation B'nai Brith, was a fine and moving presentation of
Mendelssohn's oratorio "Elijah," clocking in at nearly two hours.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, though, the notable event was Brant's 15-minute opener.</TE>
<TE>   A modest but characteristically Brant-ian piece, "Prophets"
follows a simple scheme by the composer's unorthodox standards. But
it resulted in a sonic maze that was in sharp contrast to classical
music convention, as represented by the Mendelssohn.</TE>
<TE>   Spatial experimentation was just part of it, with cantors--Mark
Childs, Lee Rothfarb, Judy Karin and Janet Laichas--positioned on
either side of the stage and in the uppermost corners of the balcony.
Additionally, like the work of Charles Ives (one of Brant's heroes),
the confluent pileup of different musical materials is important to
his aesthetics.</TE>
<TE>   Brant served as the conductor guiding the swirling musical
activity, not counting out time but choreographing the structure by
cueing vocalist's entrances. The actual notes on the score are more
traditional than the sum effect suggests, as focused solo parts
yielded to increasingly overlapping voices, with maximum polytonal
density by the end.</TE>
<TE>   This being a house of worship, and for this occasion, an
ecumenical Jewish and Christian gathering, the indecipherable mesh of
parts conspired toward a uniquely meditative effect. True to the
nature of many Brant works, it wasn't the specifics, but the spirit,
that counted.</TE>

<LD>Tamara Beckwith, British It-girl, laced up her glittery roller skates
while nearby, Dominique Swain, with skates and little pulsing lights
in her hair, posed for photographers. Swain entered the cleared
wooden floor of the Hollywood Palladium, a little unsteady at first,
and joined the crowd of gliding (or wobbling) young ICM agents,
designers, actresses, publicists, starlets, cross dressers and at
least one architect who sashayed under the lights on a recent
evening.</LD>
<LD>   Carrie Grace, a 26-year-old costume stylist, worried she had
committed the ultimate faux pas by bringing her own vintage skates to
"Roller Disco--Moroccan Style," a party intended to promote a new
line of Skechers skates designed by Tracey Ross.</LD>
<LD>   Invitations had asked people to RSVP with their shoe sizes, and
every guest got a free pair of the new skates.</LD>
<TE>   "I didn't know it was going to be such a scene," said Grace,
surveying the crowd. "Ooooh," she said, eyeing the bars, "the
cocktails add another element." She thought for a moment. "Adult
skating," she said, before excusing herself to join the several dozen
people skating to old Prince and Michael Jackson tunes.</TE>
<TE>   Some skaters had Venice Beach credentials, as evidenced by their
ability to skate, talk and drink at the same time. Others wobbled to
the bar and stayed put.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Montalbano, a 35-year-old screenwriter, rested on pillows
at a bar in the center of the rink while reminiscing about the early
'80s, when he would go to the roller rink as a teenager.</TE>
<TE>   Ah, the dates, the skates, "Midnight at the Oasis." This brought
back memories, said Montalbano with a little sigh. "The music, the
wind in your hair and you're gliding," he said. "It's the only time
it's OK to be goofy in L.A."</TE>

<TE>   'Lady Killers': Day 18 of Shooting</TE>
<TE>   It's day 18 of a five-week shoot of "Lady Killers," a slapstick
comedy, and people are hovering around an enormous brick house in a
well-manicured neighborhood near downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant director Frank Caridi,  the most visible of the group,
primarily because he wears red, rarely stops moving and periodically
barks commands. "OK! Here we go!" he shouts for the third time in
five minutes. If the crew responds, it is imperceptible. They're
accustomed to waiting.</TE>
<TE>   The set is a 100-year-old former convent, complete with elaborate
stained-glass windows, and owner Gretta von Steinbauer has rented the
place to film crews so frequently during the last three years she
can't recall every one.</TE>
<TE>   It's warm enough out to wear shorts, but, inside, a fire rages in
the fireplace. For this film, the room is dressed to depict the dusty
old mansion of a former war hero with a velvet loveseat and animal
heads mounted above the fireplace.</TE>
<TE>   Director Gary Preisler stands in the middle of the crowded den
running lines with the actors. The plot: Two money-hungry
20-year-olds marry two 70-year-olds in the hopes of inheriting their
wealth. They learn later that the women are penniless con artists
looking for two young dummies to murder for insurance money. It's an
independent production and Preisler's debut as a director.</TE>
<TE>   In this scene, Will Friedle, Chris Owen, Louise Lasser and Renee
Taylor are creeping in to shoot the boys' miserly uncle, portrayed by
Rudy DeLuca. They don't realize he's already dead. "All right!"
Caridi shouts again. "Here we come! Ready, set!"</TE>
<TE>   Preisler takes his place behind a monitor. "Hold to roll," he
shouts. Everyone ceases talking and moving. "Aaannndd action!"
Immediately, there's a technical problem. "Cut!" The crew resets
quickly for take two. The scene falls flat. They set up for take
three. Preisler is once again behind the monitor and calls action.
The scene's comedy is working. The crew is laughing. Preisler is
nodding his head. This one is a keeper. "Cut!" he shouts. "That is
hilarious!"</TE>

<LD>THE FISH'S EYE</LD>
<LD>   Essays About Angling</LD>
<LD>   and the Outdoors</LD>
<TE>   By Ian Frazier</TE>
<TE>   Farrar, Straus and Giroux</TE>
<TE>   164 pages, $20</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ian Frazier is a fanatic when it comes to fishing. The New Jersey
resident has dropped, flung and reeled lines from Manhattan's banks
of the Hudson River, along the Ohio River in downtown Cincinnati, in
concrete-lined basins in city parks, on the Jersey shore and on the
majestic trout streams of the Rocky Mountains. He's stood in
ice-clotted rivers during the depths of winter in Montana; he's even
become so engrossed with what the fish were eating--mayflies--that
he's joined the feast, eating flies until his belly was full. (The
taste wasn't bad, he writes, "sushi, basically, only grittier."</TE>
<TE>   Thankfully, he's also such an incredible writer ("On the Rez" and
"Great Plains") that even readers who don't care much about fishing
will find in "The Fish's Eye" a welcoming spot to sit and cast about
pondering the depths of life. Frazier also offers an appreciation for
nature in all forms, especially the urban variety.</TE>
<TE>   In this collection of 17 fishing-related essays written over two
decades, Frazier wades in deep on life's important matters--the
intrinsic joy found in nature, the wisdom of doing nothing and the
incredible beauty of Rocky Mountain water running "clear and cold as
chilled gin across lovely rocks in headlong flight." He also takes a
humorous look at life as seen through the fish-drunk eyes of the
angler.</TE>
<TE>   "Bad Advice," for example, tracks the awful suggestions he and
fellow anglers have followed over the years, including the time his
buddy Don, following a recipe in an outdoor cookbook, tried to make
"Breakfast in a Paper Bag." With Frazier watching, Don put strips of
bacon in the bottom of the paper sack, broke an egg on top of them,
folded the top of the sack and speared it with a stick, ready to hold
it over open coals.</TE>
<TE>   The recipe, Frazier explains, declared that the grease would coat
the bottom of the bag as it cooked. "Somehow we both took this to
mean that the grease, counterintuitively, actually made the bag less
likely to burn. Marveling at the 'who would have guessed' magic of
it, we picked a good spot in the hot coals ...." In a heartbeat, the
bag burst into leaping flames. "Don was yelling for help, waving the
bag around trying to extinguish it, scattering egg yolk and
smoldering strips of bacon and flaming paper .... "</TE>
<TE>   To Frazier, their heedless following of a book's suggestion is
emblematic of the larger truth about our species when we venture
out-of-doors. "We go forth in abundant ignorance, near-blind with
fantasy, witlessly trusting words on a page or a tip [from] a guy
we'd never met before ...." Oh, but where that faith can take us: to
snow-banked streams, amid cliffs of granite climbing heavenward from
the river bank or to magical places where "tea-colored water pours
steadily over lips as smooth as subway stairs."</TE>
<TE>   Frazier weaves seamlessly back and forth between the sublime and
the trivial, offering profound viewpoints one minute, a lighthearted
laugh the next. In advising fellow enthusiasts how to pursue the
fishing obsession without making their families too mad, for
instance, he advocates night outings: "[I]f you leave to go fishing
with everyone tucked safely in bed and return after midnight with
them still sleeping, you're free and clear. Plus, you feel harmlessly
sneaky, which is always important in a marriage." He proclaims
striped bass the perfect New York fish: "They go well with the look
of downtown ... are pinstriped .... "</TE>
<TE>   "Fishing Without Dad" is a poignant recounting of Frazier's
relationship with his father, who neither fished nor understood
Frazier's love of the sport. His father would sit and watch the
author as a young boy fish with the "benign incomprehension you give
to a dog worrying a leather toy .... " When Frazier caught something,
his father would croon, in pitying tones, "Ohhhh--let it go." Frazier
often thinks of his late father while fishing, experiencing a kind of
communion when he catches a fish and prepares to release it:</TE>
<TE>   "I hold the fish in the shallows and move it gently to revive it
and I talk to it and I get dizzy with the sensation of being in a
moment that neither of us will forget .... I feel scarily close to
the fish's complex life that went on before and that will go on
after, and close to my anxious, uncomprehending father, wherever he
may be .... I hear my father's 'Ohhhh--let it go' as the fish swims
away."</TE>
<TE>   In these essays, Frazier's metaphors leap like rainbow trout to
mayflies, creating in words lasting moments that illuminate the many
currents of his angling life.</TE>

<HD>Staking Their Claim</HD>
<DH>With sex scandals rocking the Catholic Church, parishioners
unite to fight for reforms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY ROURKE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WELLESLEY, Mass.</DL>
<LD>In an unadorned parish hall in this posh Boston suburb, a woman spoke
evenly, clearly trying to control her emotions. "I'm concerned about
my children, who are making decisions about the future for my
grandchildren," Claire Megan said. "I want them all to remain
Catholic. But not in the church the way it's been."</LD>
<LD>   This faithful churchgoer has found herself rethinking her world
these days as new accusations continue to surface about sex crimes
and cover-ups within the Catholic priesthood. Not one to see herself
as a reformer, let alone a revolutionary, she nevertheless now feels
compelled to help change the institution that has always been her
spiritual home. She is attending meetings, helping to draw up
proposals, and talking. Mostly talking. For better or worse, the
church is no longer a place people like Megan can take for granted on
Sundays. And as the Catholic church's problems become more glaring,
laypeople like this unassuming grandmother in her 60s are getting
involved.</LD>
<TE>   From Buffalo, N.Y., to Chicago to Southern California, laypeople
around the United States are getting together to see what role they
can take, many of them demanding a larger role in church governance,
meeting in ad hoc groups designed to bring about a dramatic change in
church policy. At the very least, these people want a voice, some
want more, including a church government with equal partners between
the clergy and the laity--much as the Senate and House work side by
side. They want to help police church actions, and they are prepared
to withhold their donations as leverage to bring about such change.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the most ambitious of these advocates meet every Monday
night in the parish hall of St. John the Evangelist Catholic church
in this small suburb of Boston. Their group, of which Megan is a
member, got its start when 25 parishioners met after a Sunday Mass to
vent about the former Boston priest, John J. Geoghan, accused of
molesting more than 130 boys, and Boston Cardinal Bernard Law's
long-term willingness to keep the problems hidden. The meetings have
evolved into strategy sessions with the gathering force of a social
revolution.</TE>
<TE>   The group's name, Voice of the Faithful, suggests that its members
do not intend to break away from the religious tradition they love.
Their slogan, taped to the wall of their meeting room, spells out
their straightforward, albeit difficult, goal: "Keep the faith,
change the church."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, grass-roots movements intent on reforming church
policies have cropped up repeatedly since the mid-1960s, when the
leaders of the Second Vatican Council called for greater
participation by laypeople in the life of the church. But most of
these reformist groups have focused on a single issue, from
ordination for women to birth control or equality for homosexuals.
Now, as sexual abuse charges against dozens of priests around the
world are being made public, laypeople are saying it is past time to
rethink how the church does business. "Pedophilia is only a symptom
of a disease," says Jim Muller, a cardiologist and parishioner of St.
John the Evangelist and president of Voice of the Faithful. "The
disease is absolute power."</TE>
<TE>   The possibility of changing a centuries-old governing system
composed of an all-male conference of bishops is daunting. "We've got
to stay focused," says Muller. "Our goal is to organize the laity and
give us a voice. If we start fighting over the gay issue, married
priests and everything else, we won't make it."</TE>
<TE>   No one envisions this happening overnight. Earlier this month, at
a workshop called "Reform in the Catholic Church" in Belmont, Mass.,
a few miles from Wellesley, Mary Jo Bane discussed more basic
strategies for church reform. Bane is an expert on public policy
issues and teaches at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Her
session was part of a daylong conference on a variety of religious
topics.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a question of forming an alternative institution," she told
40 people who sat in a circle around her. "I'm your basic
incrementalist. Change begins at the parish level."</TE>
<TE>   In Chicago, Dan Daley is co-director of Call to Action, a group
founded in the late-1970s that is the largest Catholic Church reform
group in the U.S. It counts 25,000 members nationwide, including lay
Catholics, nuns and priests and is monitoring lay-led movements such
as the one in Wellesley. "Parishes around the country are holding
meetings where people can talk, hear from the staff, sort out their
feelings," says Daley. "Slowly they're becoming more conscious of the
underlying issues. Particular parishes are going through the process,
but each one is quite aware that others are doing the same thing.
Call to Action is set up to connect these people. We're gearing up
for it. We've started to get requests."</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Young, a lawyer at the State University of New York at
Buffalo, is a member of Call to Action; he was in Wellesley last week
to attend a Voice of the Faithful meeting and was met with cheers
when he introduced himself in the crowded parish hall. "Tomorrow
night we're meeting in my city," he said. "I'll bring back news of
your activities."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month at San Francisco Solano parish in Orange
County's Rancho Santa Margarita, a "listening" session followed the
announcement of the resignation of parish priest Father Michael
Pecharich, who has been accused of molesting two boys. He has
resigned from the parish.</TE>
<TE>   On April 7, members of San Francisco Solana met with facilitator
Sister Kathleen Schinhofen, who helped them focus their concerns.
Next, parishioners want to meet with Orange County Bishop Tod Brown,
who recently called for an expanded role for the laity in church
decision-making procedures. His announcement came days after Los
Angeles Cardinal Roger M. Mahony made a similar plan for the Los
Angeles archdiocese. Mahony said he will include molestation victims
on a board that reviews sexual abuse allegations against priests.</TE>
<TE>   In Boston, says Muller, "the interest is keen." Within weeks of
the Voice group's first meeting in February, it attracted about 100
concerned Catholics from around the state. Now, more than 200 people
regularly attend the Monday meetings. The group has a Web site,
www.voiceofthefaithful.org, and a mailing list that grows by as many
as 100 new names a day, Muller says, now numbering about 1,500 names.
Requests for training workshops come in from around the country.
"We're besieged with people who want a model for how to create a
stronger voice for the laity," Muller says.</TE>
<TE>   He reads such signals with experienced eyes. Thirty years ago,
Muller helped found International Physicians for the Prevention of
Nuclear War, an international lobbying group, and was awarded a Nobel
Peace Prize in 1985 for the project. That group grew to include
135,000 members, but Muller says he is reaching for far greater
numbers for Voice of the Faithful. "We have maybe 300 people
committed now," he says. "We need three million." Changing church
government may be Voice of the Faithful's most ambitious goal, but it
is not the only item on its agenda. Other priorities include
supporting victims who have been molested by priests and standing up
for "priests of integrity" who have been afraid to criticize church
policies and teachings for fear of being punished by their bishops.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what we're planning is doable," says Muller. "We're going
to serve as a voice for mainstream Catholics and create a mechanism
for democracy." The test of their strength may come on July 20, when
Voice of the Faithful will hold a convention in Boston to draft a
constitution for the laity. It is expected to call for bishops to
share responsibility with laypeople, from making appointments of top
clergy to enforcing openness on the daily level of parish government.
Church leaders ought not to govern themselves, they say, no more than
police and politicians who are overseen by civilian commissions.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why he expects the church hierarchy to pay attention to
demands by the laity, Muller appeals to moral integrity, social
justice and money. "There is an unbalanced power structure with no
voice of the faithful," he says. "We need to change that. With a
constitution, we'll get the laity organized in a collective voice.
Then we'll have a democratic process in place." As for leverage,
Muller says, "the laity pays the church's bills."</TE>
<TE>   Last week at the meeting in Wellesley, Muller read a statement
drafted by Voice leaders calling for Cardinal Law to resign and for
Boston Catholics to be included in choosing his replacement, although
laity is not currently involved in that process. (The pope has since
called for a meeting of the American cardinals in Rome, which is
scheduled for today.)</TE>
<TE>   "There is a Conference of Bishops in Catholic tradition and a
College of Cardinals," says Peggie Thorp, who is on the steering
committee of the Voice group. "With a constitution," she believes,
"there will be a Conference of the Laity, with an equal voice."</TE>
<TE>   A freelance writer, Thorp says the core group members of Voice of
the Faithful grew up in the '60s. "Our age group was defined by
movements, for peace, racial justice, women's rights," she says. Some
years ago, she says, Thorp decided to drop out of the church, even
though she still attended Sunday Mass. "For years, I stood outside
church teachings and policies," she says. "I separated my faith from
the institution." In an unexpected turn, the current sexual abuse
scandal helped change her mind. "I see how my church is hurting
people," says Thorp. "I want to help fix that."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Post, a parishioner at St. John the Evangelist in Wellesley is
a lawyer who helped organize an international boycott of Nestle USA
in the late '70s in protest of the company's promotion of baby
formula in Third World countries to mothers not educated about the
advantages of breastfeeding. Using his organizing skills for Voice of
the Faithful, Post is setting up an escrow fund for Catholics who
want to divert their financial contributions from this year's annual
Cardinal's Appeal that starts in May in the Boston archdiocese. They
are suggesting that people place their contributions in the National
Catholic Community Fund, a philanthropic organization that gives
money to Catholic social-service programs.</TE>
<TE>   "This allows us to avoid giving money to what amounts to Cardinal
Law's hush fund," Post says. So far, settlement cases involving
Geoghan have cost the Boston archdiocese an estimated $35 million.</TE>
<TE>   Diverting contributions as a form of protest is not a new tactic:
Chicago-based Call to Action has held funds in escrow for members of
St. Francis Xavier church in N.Y. City. Parishioners put their
contributions in escrow when a new pastor there began to fire staff
and rearrange priorities without involving the congregation. In 1998,
parish leaders asked Daley's office to hold the Christmas collection
in escrow as leverage to help bring about change. "In a month or two,
that pastor was removed from his job," says Daley. "It wasn't cause
and effect, exactly. But withholding finances contributed to it."</TE>
<TE>   One recent Monday night at St. John the Evangelist, more than 200
people from at least 10 neighboring churches squeezed into the parish
hall. Some stopped to greet Father Tom Powers, the pastor who
supports the Voice of the Faithful but does not always attend
meetings.</TE>
<TE>   The session began with a hymn and prayers. First-time visitors
stood up to introduce themselves. "I am the mother of a victim," one
woman said in a quivering voice. "Not by a priest, by a scout
leader." Her son, now in his 20s, was molested when he was 9 and has
not recovered emotionally. She takes it personally that Boston
Cardinal Law did not report priests accused of abuse under his
jurisdiction to the police, including Geoghan and retired Father Paul
Shanley, who were repeatedly accused of molesting minors from as far
back as the late '60s.</TE>
<TE>   "To watch my sweet child grow into an angry young man breaks my
heart," the mother said. "I can't even look at the cardinal. I want
him out of his office."</TE>
<TE>   Daley, in town for the meeting, sat with hands folded at the back
of the room. "I came here to find out how the folks in Boston are
dealing with things," he says. "What happens in Boston will be
terribly important for Catholics all across America. If Boston takes
a strong stand, the church will never be the same again."</TE>
<TE>   Two hours into the meeting, 250 people were still trying to agree
about the first sentence of a statement Muller's team had drafted in
response to Cardinal Law's refusal to resign from his office.</TE>
<TE>   The statement declared a loss of confidence in Law's ability to
govern effectively. It stated that a change in leadership was
essential and called on the Vatican to meet with a delegation of
laypeople from Boston that would provide a full report on the
situation there.</TE>
<TE>   When the resignation issue is resolved, the statement said, lay
Catholics in the Boston archdiocese should be included in deciding
who Law's replacement will be.</TE>
<TE>   The process is not easy for the members of Voice of the Faithful,
and shared values notwithstanding, the particulars are hard to settle
upon. Despite bursts of applause, particularly at the suggestion that
a Boston delegation should visit the Vatican and that lay Catholics
should help choose his replacement, the group could not all agree on
the terms and language of the statement. Some argued that it is still
too early to make demands; others that the tone of the letter was too
angry.</TE>
<TE>   In attempting to estimate the will of the majority, more than 200
voted in favor of the statement, if not the precise wording. Eight
were opposed to at least part of the statement. "We want this to be a
safe place for different opinions," Muller said, still hoping to
reach a consensus. The arguing continued.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-five minutes later, several dozen people had walked out in
frustration. Maura O'Brien, a woman in her 30s who serves on the town
council, suggested another vote. This time, the purpose was only to
get "a sense of the group." Two hundred nine voted in favor of the
statement, nine could not accept it. From that night on, the room
agreed, majority vote would rule.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an extraordinarily difficult meeting," Muller later said.
"We'll go to majority rule from now on. But I hope the most
conservative members will see that Voice is a good home for them."
For two days after the meeting, Muller said, he was discouraged. But
he has since changed his mind. "I'd call it birth pains," he said.</TE>

<HD>Women Step Out of Ireland's Literary Shadows</HD>
<DH>Culture: New anthology gives country's long-ignored female
writers their due.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN DONEGAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>Throughout Irish history, a vibrant and vital culture has fought to
have its voice heard against a louder and stronger neighbor. But
while colonial ruler Britain tried to ignore or silence the demands
of Irish nationalism, a growing international literary reputation
helped cement its cause. And now Irish female writers have engaged in
a similar struggle with the country's male-dominated literary
tradition.</LD>
<LD>   Later this year, the long-anticipated, two-volume publication of
"Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing: Irish Women's Writing and
Traditions" will attempt to redress the traditional exclusion of
women's voices from Irish literature. Commissioned only after an
enormous outcry against the underrepresentation of women in the
prestigious original "Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing,"
published in 1991, the new volumes were edited almost entirely by
women.</LD>
<LD>   "What maddened people was the unthinkingness of it all," said Medb
Ruane (her first name is pronounced "Maeve"), a columnist for the
Irish Times newspaper. "The [male] editors had hardly noticed the
exclusion, and on anyone's reckoning there were wide quality
differences between some of the men included and some of the better
women excluded."</LD>
<TE>   The original publication contained a diverse array of Irish
writing, much of which had been previously overlooked, such as Irish
gothic fiction and cultural criticism. It even included ballads and
songs, atypical for a literary anthology.</TE>
<TE>   "Here was a new kind of anthology of writing drawing attention to
previously marginalized areas," said Gerardine Meaney, a professor at
University College Dublin and one of the senior editors on the new
project. "So the [exclusion of women] was a blind spot of stunning
proportion."</TE>
<TE>   According to Meaney, the new anthology includes more than 700
female writers, spanning a wide range of material, from poets of the
Middle Ages to political essayists of the 19th century to
contemporary writers such as Edna O'Brien and Eavan Boland.</TE>
<TE>   "A country which has been colonized is probably going to have one
of its most powerful narratives told by those who were colonized
within that colonization, and that has been women," said Boland, a
respected and influential poet and professor of English at Stanford
University.</TE>
<TE>   Much of Boland's work has explored what she calls "a nation below
the surface," the struggle to assert a female identity in a political
environment seemingly consumed with the conflict in Northern Ireland
but often myopic to the social and cultural life of its people,
particularly women. Boland's book of poems "Against Love Poetry"
(W.W. Norton), published last fall, returns to familiar, reflective
suburban themes of motherhood and marriage, such as this excerpt from
"The Pinhole Camera":</TE>
<TE>   For you and I</TE>
<TE>   such science holds no secrets:</TE>
<TE>   We are married thirty years,</TE>
<TE>   woman and man.</TE>
<TE>   Long enough</TE>
<TE>   to know about power and nature,</TE>
<TE>   Long enough</TE>
<TE>   to know which is which.</TE>
<TE>   With their work set against a backdrop of world-renowned male
novelists, poets and playwrights such as James Joyce, W.B. Yeats and
Samuel Beckett, as well as a literary tradition that portrayed the
struggle for national sovereignty as romantic destiny, female writers
instead often sought to establish the realities of family, community
and work as rich literary pasture.</TE>
<TE>   Novelist Edna O'Brien's first seven books were banned in Ireland
for their perceived threat to the conservative establishments of
church and state. Her early work traces the lives of two young women
who leave their strict rural homes and convent school and escape to
the delights and romantic opportunities of Dublin. "The Country
Girls," her first novel, was reviled on its publication in 1960 by a
government censor as "a smear on Irish womanhood."</TE>
<TE>   But, said O'Brien, her books posed a threat "because they were the
first palpable voicing of the sexuality of Irish women."</TE>
<TE>   She moved to London just before the publication of "The Country
Girls" and has lived there ever since. She says the original
three-volume "Field Day" anthology contained a "meager insertion" of
her writing. The new volumes will considerably enlarge her
contribution to reflect what Meaney calls "the extremely radical act
of challenging the orthodox role of women in Irish society."</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien's just published novel, "In the Forest" (Houghton
Mifflin), tells the story of the murder of a young woman, her
5-year-old son and a priest by a mentally unstable local man in a
rural Irish village. Rarely overtly political, O'Brien's writing is
erudite and unadorned:</TE>
<TE>   "She picks her steps nervously but unerringly to where Maddie is,
lifts his hands out of the muddy water, and takes him in her arms.
She starts to run. The ground feels light, like it is on springs, and
her head terrifically calm as she begins to recall different
landmarks: the tunnel, the toadstools, an old sock, the churned-up
roots of the fallen tree and the long, steep path that led from the
entrance.</TE>
<TE>   "He has almost caught up with them...."</TE>
<TE>   Drawing on actual events from 1994, the novel explores the shame
and paralysis of a community facing a violent criminal who is beyond
their comprehension. O'Brien has been criticized in Ireland for
fictionalizing such recent events. "When those murders exist in the
gut of the people, in the gut of the land, in the gut of the psyche,
it's healthy and cathartic to explore it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Edna O'Brien did a very brilliant thing and exiled herself to
England so as not to be withered by the native contempt for women,"
said Nuala O'Faolain, a journalist whose bestselling first novel, "My
Dream of You" (Riverhead Books), is just out in paperback.</TE>
<TE>   O'Faolain looks forward to the new "Field Day" anthology but says
that "nothing can heal the wound that the most brilliant academic in
Ireland just didn't care, didn't bother, didn't notice."</TE>
<TE>   Seamus Deane, now a professor of Irish studies at the University
of Notre Dame, was the editor of the 1991 anthology, a highly
regarded treasure trove of Irish literature much admired for its
innovative narrative structure. O'Faolain says she once asked him on
a television talk show why female writers were so poorly represented.
"He said, 'I forgot.' I think it's the most honest answer I ever
heard," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Deane, who is currently in Ireland and who, according to other
academics, has been supportive of the new anthology, did not return
phone calls for this story.</TE>
<TE>   O'Faolain's "My Dream of You" is part romance, part
self-exploration and part Irish history. In the novel, Kathleen de
Burca, an Irish travel writer living in London, returns home to
research an actual love story between the wife of an aristocratic
landlord and her Irish stable groom that occurred at the time of the
Irish potato famine in 1847.</TE>
<TE>   O'Faolain says her novel is about recovering health and happiness
through learning about the past. She believes it's important,
particularly for Irish women, "to recover memories and sources of
vitality that we have abandoned."</TE>
<TE>   Because the historical love affair took place at a time when more
than a million Irish people died from starvation and another million
emigrated, the famine plays a thematic role throughout the novel, one
that is dismissed in a phone call by the protagonist's English editor
as "another tome on the sorrows of Ireland."</TE>
<TE>   O'Faolain writes, "It wasn't 'sorrows,' Alex, I said through
gritted teeth. It was our Holocaust. Well, no--it wasn't deliberate,
like exterminating the Jews. But the British government was glad that
we were being exterminated by accident.</TE>
<TE>   "There was silence from his end."</TE>
<TE>   "To write about the famine is considered asking for trouble,"
O'Faolain said, referring to the intense emotional and political
reactions that the topic sometimes stirs even today.</TE>
<TE>   According to poet Boland, this is in part because it has nothing
to do with conventional heroes. "[The famine was] about brute
survival," Boland said. "It [was] women who carried the whispers of
that brute survival with them while Irish history was building its
stories of heroes."</TE>
<TE>   In Boland's view, it is through the silences of women that "one of
the great truths about Ireland opens up: that there's a powerful,
defining difference between the past and history." Boland says that
Irish history's "story of heroes" has heroism, activism and
resistance as its motifs. "But the past is different," she said.
"It's where the silences and sufferings are lodged, often below the
wish list of a historic heroism."</TE>
<TE>   Boland, O'Faolain and novelist O'Brien point to the election of
Irish President Mary Robinson in 1990 as a historic turning point in
the development of women's identity and power in Ireland. Robinson,
now United Nations high commissioner for human rights, was a
distinguished constitutional lawyer and professor at Trinity College
in Dublin who often litigated cases concerning women's and gay rights
that the political establishment was too timid or unwilling to
address.</TE>
<TE>   "Women in Ireland really were muted," O'Brien said. The election
of Robinson and current President Mary McAleese "did a lot both
internally and politically for Irish women to see such intelligent
women compose themselves and speak in that way," she said.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as 30 years ago, women in Ireland were fired from
public service jobs in government, broadcasting and elsewhere when
they married. Women have only been permitted to serve on juries since
1976.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was a grown woman and teacher, I was living in a country
where the Customs men tore the back pages out of magazines like the
Nation so that I wouldn't know that family planning existed, much
less commit the criminal act of having access to it," O'Faolain said.</TE>
<TE>   These and other legacies of what is in many ways an alternate,
parallel Irish history continue to have an impact on women in
business, public life, academia and literature. For example,
according to figures provided by the Centre for Advancement of Women
in Politics at Queen's University, Belfast, women hold just 3% of
chief executive jobs in corporate Ireland, 4% of top civil service
positions and 6% of professorships and associate professorships at
Irish universities.</TE>
<TE>   Irish Times columnist Ruane says that even on the rare occasions
when women may have held power in early Irish history--consider
Gaelic chieftain Grace O'Malley or legendary warrior Queen
Medb--there was a tendency to mythologize them as muses rather than
acknowledge their political or cultural leadership.</TE>
<TE>   But O'Brien has never been deterred from probing human emotions
and desires in the pursuit of writing about the real lives of Irish
men and women, regardless of how that is received by the masters of
church, state or academia. "The best thing one can say about writing
is that even if there have been slings and arrows, they don't
eventually kill the work," she said. "The written word is there and
will remain there--and that is a very sweet victory."</TE>

<LD>Drawings</LD>
<LD>   Do you like to doodle or draw pictures? Do you draw from your
imagination, your memory or from things you see? Drawing is an
important part of art. Artists draw for many reasons. They draw to
practice their skills, to make a sketch for a later project or to
create a finished work of art.</LD>
<LD>   What do you draw on? Throughout time, artists have drawn on almost
every surface imaginable, from cave walls and sand to paper and
photographs. Almost any tool, including charcoal, crayons, pencils
and colored chalk, may be used to draw. You can even draw with
computers.</LD>
<TE>   You might be familiar with Vincent van Gogh as a painter, but he
also produced many drawings such as the one pictured here. In fact,
van Gogh considered drawing so important that he once said, "The root
of everything is drawing."</TE>
<TE>   The man in this drawing was the artist's friend. Van Gogh drew
first in black chalk and then completed it with a reed pen dipped in
brown ink. Notice the way van Gogh drew his friend's image using only
line. The lines are of various widths and travel in different
directions.</TE>
<TE>   Try drawing something you see using only line, like van Gogh did.
Pay attention to the direction and thickness of your lines. What
parts should have thicker lines? What parts thinner? Do you like to
draw this way? Why or why not?</TE>
<TE>   You can see drawings and many other kinds of art at the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art. For more information, call (323)
857-6000 or visit www.lacma.org.</TE>

<LD>If past adventures in marketing are any indication, Abercrombie &amp;
Fitch can expect a boost in sales after its recent announcement that
the chain is pulling a line of T-shirts deemed racially insensitive.</LD>
<LD>   The clothing retailer made headlines last week when a wave of
protests from Asian American college students led it to stop selling
a series of T-shirts that feature cartoonish-looking Asian men
pulling rickshaws, bowling and hyping a Chinese laundry.</LD>
<LD>   Abercrombie &amp; Fitch officials said they were surprised by the
"hundreds and hundreds" of complaints they received, most from
California college students. "It's not our intention to offend
anyone," a company spokesman told The Times.</LD>
<TE>   But A&amp;F seems to have gotten offending people down to a fine art,
and controversy has never hurt its bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, the company came under heavy fire for the
"Drinking 101" feature in its quarterly catalog, which suggested
"creative drinking games" that seemed to promote binge drinking.
After a public uproar, the company passed out knives to its employees
and had them excise the article from store catalogs. The resulting
publicity raised the company profile in a way no advertising campaign
could have.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, its racy catalog has made the company the target of
boycotts by a variety of groups around the country, from local
National Organization for Women chapters to Christian family groups
to the Chicago City Council. And the resulting buzz has created a
cult following for a company that claims not to want to offend.</TE>
<TE>   It certainly found a way to offend a Westside mother, who wrote me
a while back complaining about the slogan on a shirt her 14-year-old
daughter bought while shopping with friends.</TE>
<TE>   "Abercrombie and Fitch Girls' Ski Team," the powder-blue T-shirt
read. "We go down at night."</TE>
<TE>   Her daughter "was oblivious to the double meaning of the message
about to go across her chest," the woman said. When she and her
husband insisted that the shirt be returned, they had to explain why
they objected to it, which entailed a description of "details of oral
sex ... that I thought could wait," she said. "It wasn't fun."</TE>
<TE>   Her daughter was embarrassed and returned the shirt, but she's
since seen it worn by 12-year-old classmates at her private school.</TE>
<TE>   My almost-17-year-old daughter rolled her eyes at the story. Part
of the attraction of A&amp;F is its raunchy, risque image. "Kids know
what it means," she says. "That's why they want to buy it."</TE>
<TE>   Company officials insist their marketing campaign is aimed at
college kids, not teens. But Abercrombie &amp; Fitch is considered the
sixth "coolest brand" by teenagers, ahead of such products as
Coca-Cola, Levi's and Nintendo. And on my visit to the Abercrombie &amp;
Fitch at our local mall this weekend, the company's 18- to
22-year-old target audience was clearly outnumbered by parents and
kids.</TE>
<TE>   Now, I'm no fashion maven, but the clothes--mostly T-shirts and
casual pants and shorts--didn't look much different from what you'd
find at the Gap or Banana Republic, and neither did the customers.
There were a few mothers with teenage daughters, a group of teenage
boys sifting through a table of sale T-shirts, a young couple in
their 20s shopping for clothes for a Hawaiian vacation. A woman who
looked to be about my age emerged from the fitting room with an
armload of sweaters and shirts. Someone's hip-looking middle-aged dad
put a couple pairs of cargo pants on his A&amp;F credit card.</TE>
<TE>   Just ahead of me in line were two girls who couldn't have been
more than 16. Each was clutching a pair of $6 turquoise briefs. "Can
I have a shopping bag for that ... the one with the guy," one girl
asked the clerk, who nodded and dropped the panties into a giant
shopping bag emblazoned with a photo of a buffed, blond surfer-type.</TE>
<TE>   "I suppose you want a bag, too," the clerk asked her friend, as
she stepped up with her briefs. The girl nodded, then flushed bright
red as the clerk handed back her tiny purchase in its giant package.</TE>
<TE>   Does that happen a lot?" I asked, when my turn came. "All the
time," the clerk said.</TE>
<TE>   Middle school girls have pictures of naked boys cut from the
magazine and posted on their lockers. The rooms of some high school
girls are a shrine to the boys. The clerk reached under the counter
for a surfer boy bag for me. I was buying a copy of A&amp;F Quarterly,
their summer catalog, shrink-wrapped and covered with warning labels.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll need to see your driver's license," the clerk told me. "But
I'm paying cash," I said, handing her my $6.</TE>
<TE>   "I still need to see your driver's license," she said. "The
register won't let me ring it up unless I put in your birth date."</TE>
<TE>   It was the first time I'd been carded in a clothing store. You
have to be 18 ... but that's to look at the clothes, not wear them.</TE>
<TE>   It took me just a moment to figure out why the magazine's
off-limits to kids. It makes the Victoria's Secret catalog look like
a version of Ladies' Home Journal.</TE>
<TE>   On the cover is a nude couple facing each other, with lithe,
perfect bodies and flowing blond hair. On the inside cover, they're
walking nude through a park, with nothing covered up. On the next
page, they're cavorting naked in the water. On the next, you get a
close-up of the woman's bare breasts.</TE>
<TE>   You're 10 pages into this clothing retailer's magazine before
anyone appears in clothes. And every few pages you get what we used
to call pinups, full-page nude shots of young men and women in
provocative poses.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say they're not trying to sell clothes. They're trying
to create a magazine that "reflects the college lifestyle," which
would seem to be a lot of well-built white kids groping each other
and lying about naked.</TE>
<TE>   And it's not hard to figure out it didn't occur to company
officials that the Asian T-shirt would offend anyone. Every model in
their 280-page catalog appears to be white.</TE>
<TE>   I suppose that's all right. Just as clothing lines by Tommy
Hilfiger and FUBU have became the brands of choice for urban teens,
A&amp;F has become the standard for the suburban white kid, the
private-school crowd.</TE>
<TE>   The message is as clear as the tan lines on their models' perfect
naked bodies.</TE>

<HD>Office Humor Is Always at Work</HD>
<DH>Those honored on Administrative Professionals Day slyly
keep stress at bay.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ADAM TSCHORN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fifty years ago, National Secretaries Day was created as a thank-you
for the folks who keep the offices of America on track. It has
expanded in name and scope, and tomorrow, as the nation celebrates
Administrative Professionals Day, we honor one of the profession's
most critical workplace contributions: a subversive sense of humor.</LD>
<LD>   Examples of it are everywhere. On television, we've gotten heavy
doses of support staff attitude from David Spade as personal
assistant Finch in "Just Shoot Me" and from Hattie Winston as
nurse/office manager Margaret and Shawnee Smith as her aide, Linda,
in "Becker." In earlier days, we got an earful from Marcia Wallace as
receptionist Carol on "The Bob Newhart Show" and from Lily Tomlin as
operator Ernestine on "Laugh-In."</LD>
<LD>   In real-life offices, where acting like Finch or Ernestine is a
ticket out the door, it takes a different form, like the
third-generation photocopied sentiment taped to a computer terminal
that reads, "Failure to plan on your part does NOT constitute an
emergency on my part," or the sign posted near the fax machine,
"Stress button--bang head here."</LD>
<TE>   Welcome to the snarky world of in-your-face office humor fueled by
the stresses of the workplace and spread by the Internet, photocopier
and fax. And, like the holiday, this vein of humor is no longer the
sole domain of secretaries; it can be found stapled, taped and pinned
to the cubicles of proofreaders, records clerks and other unseen
heavy-lifters of corporate America.</TE>
<TE>   Sherry Grossman, a legal secretary at the downtown law firm of
O'Melveny &amp; Myers, sits at her 17th-floor cubicle facing three neatly
mounted signs. On one, a blue flower print frame displays the words
"Computers do more work than people because they never have to answer
the phone." Next to it, shellacked to a wooden board is the saying,
"If you want a quick answer, ask the boss, if you want the correct
answer, ask the secretary."</TE>
<TE>   The final one, a professionally printed poster, advises, "Please
be patient. I only have two speeds, and if this one isn't fast
enough, then I'm sure you won't like my other."</TE>
<TE>   "I got them at gift shops," said Grossman. "Just for the fun of
it. It helps you let off steam a little bit, but it's not serious. If
I was annoyed enough with my job, the sign wouldn't do it, and if I
felt uncomfortable in my job, I wouldn't put the sign up."</TE>
<TE>   But Grossman's neatly mounted musings on the stressed-out lives of
the admin set are the exception. Most of the jokes appear as e-mail
printouts, poor-quality copies and crudely drawn cartoons. Just one
floor above Grossman, in the same law firm, Iris Aparicio's desk is a
virtual shrine to this brand of cubicle comedy.</TE>
<TE>   The lead records clerk has posted the sign: "I've been beaten,
choked, kicked, lied to, swindled, taken advantage of and laughed
at.... The only reason I hang around is to see what happens next!"
Next to it a Snoopy-like dog dances, grimaces and snarls his way
through a seven-panel cartoon entitled "Typical Work Week."</TE>
<TE>   "It's for morale, for giggles," Aparicio says as she holds up a
recent arrival. It is a photo of a skeleton slumped over a desk with
the caption "Waiting for a raise."</TE>
<TE>   "It would be depressing if I didn't have something to laugh at.
There's so much going on, every so often you just have to turn around
and smile. My desk is a pick-me-up."</TE>
<TE>   Other "pick-me-ups" cataloged in a recent survey of workplace
postings include a cheery yellow "button" (roughly the size of a
saucepan lid) that says, "Tell me again how lucky I am to work here
... I keep forgetting," a line drawing of a zebra with its stripes
unraveling onto the floor and the words "It must be the stress"
beneath it, and a sign that reads, "I can only be nice to one person
a day. Today is not your day. Tomorrow isn't looking so good either."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the messages express diet and health concerns such as:
"Exercise, eat right, die anyway" and "Notice: This department
requires no physical fitness program. Everyone gets enough exercise
jumping to conclusions, flying off of the handle, running down the
boss, knifing friends in the back, dodging responsibility and pushing
their luck." One poster features the plea "Please God, if you can't
make me thin, please make my friends fat" inexplicably placed beneath
a photo of a kitten (which doesn't appear particularly fat or thin).</TE>
<TE>   Kittens, in fact, seem to have become the totem animal of
secretary humor, frequently appearing in cartoons and on posters with
no apparent link. Perhaps it's homage to the granddaddy of all
secretary humor, that now-familiar poster of a kitten hanging by its
forepaws from a branch. The caption reads, "Hang in there baby,
Friday's comin'."</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros.' Tweety Bird makes an occasional appearance--one
poster pictures Tweety wearing a halo and the prayer: "I want to
thank you, Lord, for being close to me so far this day. With your
help, I haven't been impatient, lost my temper, grumpy, judgmental,
or envious of anyone. But, I will be getting out of bed in a minute,
and I think I'll really need your help then. Amen." In another, a
duck stands holding a large mallet over a computer terminal. The
caption reads, "Hit any key to continue."</TE>
<TE>   Some secretary humor directly addresses the topic of
complaints--such as the quarter-inch square on a piece of paper
bearing the words "Complaint Box--please write legibly" or the
Complaint Department button that has a "press here for service" sign
taped to the business end of a mousetrap.</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to tell which cartoons and messages are the most
popular; secretary humor comes with its own unofficial rating system.
The numbers of pinholes in the upper corners indicate how often a
particular piece has been taken down for a run through the office
copier. Shredded corners constitute the highest praise.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Wilde, an author and motivational speaker who lectures on
the value of workplace humor, says such workplace displays are
healthy.</TE>
<TE>   "If you do your job, what difference does it make if you do it
with a smile on your face?" said Wilde. "People should do anything
they possibly can to relieve the monotony of the workplace."</TE>
<TE>   Wilde, who in 1976 took it upon himself to establish April as
National Humor Month, suggests that people with a sense of humor are
more productive than those without. "Anything that releases stress
and tension is good. Anything that helps you take your work seriously
but not yourself seriously is valuable."</TE>
<TE>   So, as you walk through the office today, just remember: That
crudely lettered sign that reads, "I'm down to my last nerve--and
you're on it" is just your co-worker's way of helping the bottom
line.</TE>

<LD>Maria and her younger brother Alfonso are walking with their Uncle
Ruben high in the mountains of Southern California. Uncle Ruben is a
nature guide in the San Bernardino National Forest, and he knows all
about plants and Native American history.</LD>
<LD>   "Look, look," Maria yelled, running down the trail with delight.
"Look at all these acorns. We studied them in school--they come from
oak trees and Indians used to eat them."</LD>
<LD>   Uncle Ruben smiled as he picked up a round black acorn. "How are
they eaten?" he asked, waiting to see what Maria would say.</LD>
<TE>   "Our teacher said they ground them up and made bread and mush,"
Maria said proudly.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I read that in a book, too," Alfonso piped in.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, you're right," Uncle Ruben said. "People in the past didn't
just pick these up and eat them, though. They had to take off these
shells. Then they ground the acorns and cooked them to get rid of the
bitter tannic acid."</TE>
<TE>   "Ohhh," Maria and Alfonso said, listening to their uncle's every
word.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's all collect some," Uncle Ruben said. And they filled a
small bag with black oak acorns.</TE>
<TE>   They continued walking along a trail until they came to some large
rocks.</TE>
<TE>   "Uncle, uncle, come here quick," Alfonso yelled. "Look what I
found."</TE>
<TE>   Maria and Uncle Ruben came over and saw holes or depressions in
the rock.</TE>
<TE>   "What are they?" Maria asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Those holes were made by Native Americans many years ago," Uncle
Ruben said. "That is where they ground the acorns into a meal. They
would then take the meal to the river to wash out the bitterness."</TE>
<TE>   It was getting dark, so they all went back to camp. They spent the
evening shelling and cooking the acorns they collected. They made
some acorn pancakes. Alfonso said they were delicious. Maria just
said, "Yuck!"</TE>

<LD>Adelphia Communications Corp.'s credit rating was reduced two levels
by Standard &amp; Poor's, the second time the cable television operator's
rating has been cut this month.</LD>
<LD>   Adelphia's rating was cut to CCC+, the seventh-highest of 11
ratings, from B by S&amp;P, which left the rating on "watch developing."
S&amp;P lowered Adelphia's rating from BB- on April 8.</LD>
<LD>   A formal inquiry into the company by U.S. regulators, along with
Adelphia's delay in its financial reports, "further exacerbates
Adelphia's already weakened financial profile," S&amp;P said.</LD>

station in Jacksonville--the nation's 53rd-largest market.</LD>
<LD>   UPN, meanwhile, said Clear Channel's Fox affiliate in

<LD>The Treasury Department sold $11 billion in three-month bills at a
discount rate of 1.690%, up from 1.680% last week. An additional $11
billion was sold in six-month bills at a rate of 1.880%, down from
1.905%.</LD>
<LD>   The three-month rate was the highest since April 8, when the bills
sold for 1.710%. The six-month rate was the lowest since Feb. 25,
when the rate was 1.850%.</LD>
<LD>   The new discount rates understate the actual return to
investors--1.720% for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,957.30, and 1.923% for a six-month bill selling for $9,905.</LD>
<TE>   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year constant maturity Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 2.42% last
week from 2.53% the previous week.</TE>

<LD>Roche's U.S. unit and five other vitamin makers will pay $19.6
million to settle Massachusetts consumers' lawsuits that claim the
companies conspired to fix vitamin prices for a decade.</LD>
<LD>   Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., BASF Corp., Aventis Animal Nutrition, and
Japan's Eisai Co., Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co., and Takeda Chemical
Industries Ltd. agreed to settle the claims after Massachusetts'
highest court ruled state consumer-protection laws could be used to
press what amounts to price-fixing claims.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement is a spinoff of a larger investigation into price
fixing by major vitamin producers. Since 1999, the companies have
agreed to pay a total of $497 million to settle similar claims
brought by state attorneys general and plaintiffs in class-action
lawsuits filed in federal court.</LD>
<TE>   In November 2001, European Union officials fined Roche, BASF and
six other companies $752 million for fixing vitamin prices.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials were not immediately available to comment.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>3M Co. said first-quarter profit was little changed even as sales
fell for the fourth straight time because Chief Executive James
McNerney cut costs and focused on fast-growing units such as health
care.</LD>
<LD>   Net income fell to $452 million, or $1.14 a share, from
$453million, or $1.13, a year earlier, 3M said. Sales fell 6.6% to
$3.89billion.</LD>
<LD>   3M said earlier this month that profit would exceed estimates
because of McNerney's cost cutting. The former General Electric Co.
executive expects to save $1 billion by year's end.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of 3M rose 12 cents to $125.01 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<LD>Microsoft Corp., the world's biggest software maker, said that Seamus
Blackley, co-inventor of the Xbox video-game console, is leaving the
company four days after it slashed its sales targets for the device.</LD>
<LD>   Blackley, who helped persuade Chairman Bill Gates to build the
money-losing Xbox, plans to form a new gaming venture.</LD>
<LD>   James Bernard, a spokesman for the Redmond, Wash., company,
declined to say who would assume Blackley's responsibilities.</LD>
<TE>   Microsoft, which for years shunned selling products other than its
flagship personal-computer software, introduced the Xbox in the U.S.
in November.</TE>
<TE>   Sales have tapered since then and have trailed forecasts in Europe
and Japan, forcing the software maker to reduce sales estimates.</TE>

<LD>Emulex Corp., a large maker of computer circuit cards, has agreed to
relocate its corporate office to a new site several blocks away in
Costa Mesa for about $35 million, the company said.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts described the lease to occupy 180,000 square feet for 10
years as one of the largest in Orange County this year. The office
will be built on a 14.5-acre parcel on Susan Street between Harbor
Boulevard and South Coast Drive and can be expanded by 65,000 square
feet, said Royce Sharf, a vice president at Julian J. Studley Inc. in
Irvine who handled the deal.</LD>
<LD>   The project is part of a broader plan to develop Segerstrom Home
Ranch by C.J. Segerstrom &amp; Sons, one of the county's largest
landholders and creator of South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa.</LD>
<TE>   Across the street, furniture retailer IKEA is building a store on
land it purchased from Segerstrom.</TE>
<TE>   The move allows Emulex to consolidate under one roof its engineers
and laboratories, currently spread over four buildings, said Paul
Folino, the company's chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   As many as 350 employees will move to the two-story complex,
Folino said. The project is scheduled to be ready in September 2003.</TE>

<HD>Flex Space Getting Harder to Fill</HD>
<DH>Vacancies are rising in Orange County at once-popular
buildings that can be adapted for office or industrial use.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB HOWARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Low-rise office space in Orange County that was filling as fast as it
was being built two years ago is now 30% vacant according to at least
one study, saddling that segment of the office market with one of the
highest vacancy rates in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   The low-rise, campus-style offices are known in real estate
circles as flex office or flex-tech space because they consist of
two-story concrete buildings that can readily be designed for either
office or industrial use or a combination.</LD>
<LD>   Flex-tech space was in such demand in 1999 and 2000 that some
buildings commanded rents approaching those of prestigious
marble-clad high-rises, up to $2.75 per square foot per month.
Flex-tech rents have since plunged by half in some buildings and by
30% to 40% in most.</LD>
<TE>   The reversal of fortunes, real estate observers say, reflects the
economic slump, a slowdown among technology companies and zealous
building by developers who rushed to meet demand that looked like it
would never end.</TE>
<TE>   "This is definitely the softest component in the office and
industrial markets," said Royce Sharf, an office broker with Julien
J. Studley Inc. "We're representing two companies who are looking for
50,000 square feet each, and we came up with 43 alternatives just in
the airport area and South Orange County."</TE>
<TE>   Real estate brokerages report significantly different totals of
flex-tech space and vacancy rates because they don't agree on which
buildings should be considered flex space. Reports on the size of the
flex market range from about 10million to 16 million square feet, and
vacancy numbers range from about 23% to more than 30%.</TE>
<TE>   All of the reports, however, show that flex-tech space has
suffered severely in the economic downturn.</TE>
<TE>   Variety of Tenants</TE>
<TE>   Filled Flex Office Space</TE>
<TE>   Most of the flex space was built on a speculative basis, meaning
developers had no tenants signed up when construction began but they
expected to fill the buildings soon after construction was completed.
Flex space looked more profitable for developers, Sharf said, because
they could build it for about $140 to $175 per square foot, compared
with about $250 to $275 per square foot for high-rise space.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the flex-tech space was built in the second half of the
1990s, when the region's growing economy created demand for projects
such as the 280,000-square-foot Gateway Inc. computers facility in
Lake Forest.</TE>
<TE>   About 200,000 square feet of the Gateway facility is available for
sublease, said Sharf, the company's broker, who explained that the
computer firm has consolidated many former Lake Forest operations
into offices elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Technology companies put the "tech" in flex-tech, but many other
types of tenants also filled the flex offices, said Rich Elbaum, a
spokesman for Irvine Co.,  Orange County's biggest builder of flex
space.</TE>
<TE>   Landlords are counting on those other types of tenants, such as
insurance companies, engineering firms, medical products assemblers
and distributors, marketing firms and other service companies, to
take up the slack left by the still-stalled technology sector.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Irvine Co. has halted construction of flex space,
as have other developers except for a few who are finishing projects
that were started when demand was strong.</TE>
<TE>   A 100,000-square-foot development in Lake Forest called Orchard
Technology Park is scheduled to be finished this summer, said Andrei
Olenicoff, a vice president at Newport Beach-based Olen Properties
Corp., developer of the project.</TE>
<TE>   Demand for flex space was robust when Olen bought the land for the
development in August 2000, Olenicoff said, and the market still
seemed relatively strong when the company obtained building permits a
year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "If the market had been where it is now, we might have held off
[construction]," Olenicoff said, but he added that Olen believes its
project will attract tenants.</TE>
<TE>   "It combines industrial with office space," Olenicoff said. "I
would not want to be building 100% flex office space."</TE>
<TE>   The projects with the most empty space, Olenicoff explained, are
the "pure office" flex buildings that have no industrial features,
such as roll-up doors and loading docks. Olen, which owns about
4million square feet of commercial buildings in Orange County, is
getting higher rents in its combination office and industrial
buildings than it is in those that are 100% office space.</TE>
<TE>   Olen's new project will target users who want up to 50% office
space with their industrial buildings. Its five buildings are
designed to be leased to smaller tenants--those requiring 1,000 to
4,000 square feet of combined office and industrial space.</TE>
<TE>   Long-Term Outlook Good for Flex Space</TE>
<TE>   Elbaum and Sharf said prospective tenants have shown increased
interest in flex office space in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   The long-term outlook for flex space is good, many in the industry
say, because it will be attractive when the economy recovers and
businesses begin expanding.</TE>
<TE>   Triple Net Properties of Santa Ana showed its confidence in the
flex office market recently when it paid nearly $24 million for the
167,585-square-foot Pacific Corporate Park in Lake Forest.</TE>
<TE>   The project was 78% occupied at the time of the purchase, but
Triple Net has since signed one tenant that boosted occupancy to 82%
and has a letter of intent from another that will push occupancy to
approximately 88%, said Tony Thompson, Triple Net's president and
chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   For many developers and investors, however, flex space is taking
much longer to fill than it did when they started or bought their
projects.</TE>
<TE>   Now, brokers say, filling the empty space could take two to three
years.</TE>

<HD>Downbeat Telecom Forecasts Hit Stocks; Dow Falls 120 Points</HD>
<DH>Markets: Continuing tech malaise spreads to other sectors.
Euro retreats from three-month high.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks closed broadly lower Monday, hit by another wave of bad news
from the telecom sector and general uneasiness about the outlook for
corporate earnings.</LD>
<LD>   In currency trading, the euro fell from a three-month high against
the dollar after the first-round election victory of French
presidential candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen, who heads the far-right
party.</LD>
<LD>   On Wall Street, stocks fell from the opening bell after WorldCom
Group late Friday cut its sales forecasts for 2002 and as Swedish
telecom equipment giant Ericsson issued a bleak earnings forecast and
slashed jobs.</LD>
<TE>   The tech- and telecom-heavy Nasdaq composite index slid 38.15
points, or 2.1%, to 1,758.68. The Dow industrials fell 120.68 points,
or 1.2%, to 10,136.43.</TE>
<TE>   Losers topped winners by 2 to 1 on Nasdaq and by 20 to 12 on the
New York Stock Exchange in moderate trading.</TE>
<TE>   The continuing barrage of bad news from the telecom industry is
causing more investors to give up any hope of a rebound for that
sector this year, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   That was evident from the plunge in WorldCom Group shares. The
price sank $1.97, or 33%, to $4.01 on Nasdaq. Investors had hammered
the stock down from $14.08 at year-end to $5.98 on Friday, before the
company reduced its 2002 forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   Ericsson shares dived 80 cents, or 23%, to $2.74.</TE>
<TE>   Fear of a protracted recession for telecom and tech also hit such
stocks as Cisco Systems, down 39 cents to $14.87; IBM, off $1.07 to
$87.93; and Broadcom, off $1.66 to $36.90.</TE>
<TE>   But the selling Monday was broader than telecom and tech. Bank,
airline, retail and drug stocks also were weak. "Overall, I think the
market is in a prove-it-to-me mood, rather than just hoping earnings
will get better," said Robert Harrington, trader at UBS Warburg.</TE>
<TE>   Earnings of blue-chip firms overall were expected to be down in
the first quarter, so investors have been focusing on what companies
say about the rest of the year. Those forecasts have been mixed.</TE>
<TE>   "To the extent that people are expecting a stronger second half of
2002, they might be disappointed," said Robert Streed, manager of the
Northern Select Equity Fund.</TE>
<TE>   European stock markets closed mostly lower Monday, hit primarily
by tech and telecom weakness. There also may have been concern about
Le Pen's victory in the French first-round election, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The euro weakened from Friday's three-month high of 89.2 U.S.
cents, slipping to 88.9cents.</TE>
<TE>   Le Pen opposes closer ties among European nations, but analysts
say he is almost certain to lose to incumbent President Jacques
Chirac in the May 5 vote.</TE>
<TE>   Among Monday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Telecom shares falling sharply included Qualcomm, down $2.23 to
$35.03; Sprint PCS, off 97 cents to $11.19; WorldCom MCI, down 77
cents to $4.23; and Verizon Communications, down $2 to $40.</TE>
<TE>   * Sellers chipped away at such big-name issues as Alcoa, off $1.77
to $35.71; Wal-Mart, down $1.38 to $57.55; and Johnson &amp; Johnson,
down $1.15 to $63.34.</TE>
<TE>   * In the tech sector, Santa Ana-based simulation software firm
MSC.Software plummeted $7.79, or 39%, to $11.97. The firm said it
expects to post a first-quarter loss instead of a profit because of
weak foreign markets and legal expenses.</TE>
<TE>   * AOL Time Warner fell $1.06 to $19.87 as analysts doubted recent
market rumors that the firm might consider spinning off its Internet
unit.</TE>
<TE>   * Spiegel dropped $1.70 to $1.10 after the owner of the Spiegel
catalog and Eddie Bauer retail chain said it won't be able to sell
its credit card business for as much as expected.</TE>
<TE>   * Airline shares sank on growing worries about the effects of new
fare wars. Southwest slid 68 cents to $18.25, and Northwest lost 98
cents to $19.16.</TE>
<TE>   * On the plus side, shares of home builders resumed their rally.
Ryland jumped $4.14 to a record high of $103.64. William Lyon Homes
surged $2.18 to $25.95.</TE>

<HD>Morningstar to Alter 'Star' System</HD>
<DH>Investing: Mutual fund ratings will be based on performance
within specific categories rather than broad asset class.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Morningstar Inc. said Monday it will overhaul its 17-year-old mutual
fund "star" ratings, seeking to make the widely quoted performance
snapshots more useful to investors and less swayed by market
tailwinds and headwinds.</LD>
<LD>   Starting in July, the star ratings will be based on individual
stock and bond funds' risk-adjusted performance compared with their
peers in more than 40 specific fund categories, such as large-cap
growth stock funds or long-term government bond funds.</LD>
<LD>   Currently, a fund's performance is measured against its broad
asset class, such as all U.S. stock funds or all taxable bond funds.</LD>
<TE>   The star ratings (from 1 to 5, with 5 the top rating) also will
put more emphasis on volatility of performance, giving an edge to
consistent managers and penalizing those whose funds have been prone
to major swings, Chicago-based Morningstar said.</TE>
<TE>   The changes should help investors better determine whether
managers are "adding value" within their specific fund categories,
said Russel Kinnel, Morningstar's director of fund analysis. Managers
will no longer get a boost, or be penalized, simply because their
fund category has been in or out of favor in recent years, Kinnel
said.</TE>
<TE>   Star ratings are based on three-, five- and 10-year returns, as
available; funds newer than 3 years old are not assigned stars.</TE>
<TE>   Ten of the 25 biggest stock and bond funds will see their star
ratings change under the new system, according to Morningstar
projections. American Funds' Growth Fund of America, for example, a
standout in the slumping large-cap growth category, would get 5 stars
rather than the current 4; conversely, Putnam Growth &amp; Income, which
has benefited from being in the relatively unscathed large-cap value
category, would be downgraded to 2 stars from 3.</TE>
<TE>   The new star system will be similar to Morningstar's current
"category ratings" system, which will be dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Kinnel said the change won't matter much to many financial
advisors and Morningstar clients who recognized the shortcomings of
the old system. But he said the shift should make the star ratings
more reliable for those who see them quoted in fund advertising and
use them as a "quick shorthand" for finding investment ideas.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine-based financial planner Victoria Collins agreed. "Anything
Morningstar can do to improve the ratings will help," she said.
"Knowing that people use them in a simplistic way, at least they
should be as accurate as possible. The general public has come to
rely on the star rating system."</TE>
<TE>   Bart Francis, president of Evensky, Brown &amp; Katz, a wealth
management firm in Coral Gables, Fla., said his firm ignores the
current star ratings, though "some clients use them to make a quick
cut, or they may ask us why a particular manager has four stars while
someone else has five." For investors who follow the ratings,
"comparing funds against their peers only makes sense," Francis said.</TE>
<TE>   As an example of how the star ratings landscape will change, of
the 109 small-cap "value" stock funds that have a three-year track
record, currently 60 get 5 stars and none gets 1 star, said
Morningstar analyst Christopher Traulsen. Under the new system, the
distribution will even out: At least 11 of the funds will be rated 5
stars and at least 11 will be rated 1 star (the actual numbers may
vary because of multiple share classes).</TE>
<TE>   Morningstar will use a bell curve to award stars: Ten percent of
funds in each category will get 1 star and 10% will get 5 stars;
22.5% will get two stars and 22.5% will get four stars; 35% will get
3 stars.</TE>
<TE>   The changes will almost certainly alter how some fund companies
market their funds in ads or investor literature, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Four- and 5-star funds have gotten strong net cash inflows from
investors every year since 1999 and so far this year, according to
Boston-based data tracker Financial Research Corp., whereas 1-, 2-
and 3-star funds, as a group, have seen consistent outflows. Fund
flows measure new money invested minus redemptions.</TE>
<TE>   But it's unclear whether performance-chasers rely on star ratings
or raw returns, Traulsen said. Funds that are too new to be rated by
Morningstar also have gotten strong net cash inflows in recent years,
Financial Research data show--perhaps because they have been launched
in strong categories.</TE>
<TE>   More information about the new ratings is available on the Web at
www.morningstar.com.</TE>

<LD>Institutional investors advised by Glendale investment manager
American Realty Advisors have acquired a nine-story office building
in Orange County's John Wayne Airport commercial district for a price
estimated in the low $40-million range.</LD>
<LD>   ARA's purchase of 4100 Newport Place in Newport Beach is the third
major sale in the district in the last few months. Newport Place was
sold by another institutional group, an Advent Realty fund managed by
Boston pension fund advisor TA Associates Realty, which had owned the
property since 1992.</LD>
<LD>   The 183,000-square-foot building was built in 1990 and is 90%
leased.</LD>
<TE>   Tenants include various financial institutions, professional
service firms and technology companies.</TE>
<TE>   Commercial property investment broker Robert S. Smith of CB
Richard Ellis said the buyer and seller agreed to keep the sale price
confidential, but that 17 interested buyers submitted bids.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, who brokered the sale with CB colleagues Michael Kane and
Karen Scholte, said Newport Beach's so-called Greenlight initiative
should limit future competition for the building.</TE>
<TE>   The measure subjects development proposals exceeding the city's
general plan parameters to a citywide vote.</TE>
<TE>   ARA's purchase follows other significant airport-area deals. In
November, real estate investment trust Glenborough Realty paid nearly
$27million for the Newport Plaza complex on Dove Street. And in
January, an institutional fund managed by Prudential Real Estate
Investors bought the new 12-story Opus Center Irvine I for about $70
million.</TE>
<TE>   Although tenant demand for Orange County office space fell sharply
with the technology sector decline and the general economic
recession, the airport vicinity remains the county's most active
market. And Newport Beach remains the county's most prestigious--and
expensive--address.</TE>
<TE>   Brokerage Cushman &amp; Wakefield reports that Newport Beach's office
vacancy rate (including space available for sublease) is 13.4%,
compared with 17.5% for the airport vicinity and 17.8% countywide.</TE>
<TE>   Landlords are asking an average rental rate of about $33.50 a
square foot annually for available Newport Beach offices. The
airport-area average is $30; the countywide rate is $26.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Firms on EU Tariff List</HD>
<DH>Trade: Duties may be imposed against Ford, GE, others in
retaliation for steel protections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Electric Co., Motorola Inc. and Ford Motor Co. are among the
companies whose products are targeted for planned tariffs by the
European Union, according to a U.S. trade organization.</LD>
<LD>   The EU's target list of $335 million in annual tariffs may impose
import duties as high as 100% on U.S. imports such as clothing,
footwear, steel products and citrus fruit in retaliation for U.S.
tariff and quota protection for its domestic steel industry.</LD>
<LD>   Products from Caterpillar Inc., Nike Inc., Reebok International
Ltd., Levi Strauss &amp; Co., Alcoa Inc. and DuPont Co. also would be
targeted, according to a list compiled by the EU Committee of the
American Chamber of Commerce in Belgium.</LD>
<TE>   The American Chamber, a member of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
represents more than 130 U.S. companies operating in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to have a severe impact both politically and
economically if the EU goes ahead," said Timothy Deal, senior vice
president at the U.S. Council for International Business in
Washington, which lobbies on behalf of companies, including General
Motors Corp. and IBM Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "It will really sour the transatlantic climate because the EU has
jumped the gun."</TE>
<TE>   The duties, which need the backing of the EU's 15 member states,
may be imposed beginning June 18 if the U.S. refuses to offer the EU
compensation for its steel tariffs.</TE>
<TE>   The targets are drawn from a wider range of trade sanctions valued
at $2.2 billion that the European Union may impose if the World Trade
Organization rules against the U.S. tariffs, announced by President
Bush on March 20. A final WTO ruling may take at least 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   The list targets U.S. products for which there are alternative
sources of supply to minimize the effect on European consumers, said
European Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy last week.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. already has threatened to challenge any EU attempt to
counter its steel restrictions. It says such attempts would be
illegal under WTO rules.</TE>
<TE>   The EU says retaliation is allowed because the U.S. cannot prove
that steel imports showed an "absolute increase" in recent years.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Defers Ruling on Banks Entering Real Estate</HD>
<DH>Banking: Decision will be delayed until after the November
election, Treasury secretary says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill told Congress on Monday that
the government won't decide this year whether banks can enter the
real estate business, putting off a politically sensitive call until
after the November election.</LD>
<LD>   The Treasury and the Federal Reserve are due to issue rules on
whether banks can enter real estate brokerage and management under
the recent comprehensive financial services overhaul law.</LD>
<LD>   "The volume of letters demonstrates the sensitivity of this
particular determination as well as the difficulty of the task that
Congress gave us in promoting competition in financial services,"
O'Neill wrote to House Financial Services Committee Chairman Michael
G. Oxley (R-Ohio).</LD>
<TE>   Banks keenly support the ability to expand their business. Real
estate agents are just as firmly opposed to it.</TE>
<TE>   Congress in its 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley financial services law
prohibited banks from entering the real estate business, but gave
Treasury and the Fed the ability to issue regulations overturning
those restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Banking and real estate trade associations, both carrying
substantial political clout, lobbied their sides of the issue hard.</TE>
<TE>   In January, the Fed issued proposed rules opening the real estate
business to federally chartered banks. Members of Congress have
proposed legislation that would block that expansion of banks'
activities.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill was responding to an April 18 letter from Oxley requesting
a report on the status of the regulations.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill said the rule was especially challenging because it would
establish a precedent for future decisions about what activities
would be allowed under the financial services law. He said Treasury
had received around 35,000 letters during a four-month comment
period, demonstrating the high degree of interest in the issue.</TE>

<TE>   AIG Asks NYSE, SEC to Probe Trading Activity</TE>
<TE>   American International Group Inc., the biggest insurer, on Monday
asked the New York Stock Exchange and Securities and Exchange
Commission to investigate trading in its stock, which fell as low as
$67.49--its weakest level since the one-year low of $67.05 reached on
Sept. 21.</TE>
<TE>   The New York-based company said it observed "considerable" short
selling in its shares. Short sellers borrow stock and sell it,
betting the market price will decline. If they're right, they can
repurchase the shares at a lower price later and pocket the
difference.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Norton, an AIG spokesman, declined to comment immediately on
what the company wanted the NYSE and SEC to investigate. John Nestor,
a spokesman for the SEC, and Ray Pellecchia of the NYSE declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   AIG shares pulled up from their low to close at $69.71, off $1.08
for the day. The price is down 12% this year.</TE>

<HD>Enron Says Assets Off by Billions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Enron Corp. may have overstated the value of its assets and financial
contracts by as much as $24 billion late last year, the company said
in a regulatory filing Monday.</LD>
<LD>   At least part of the overstatement relates to transactions Enron
made with a network of private partnerships that hid debt and assets
from shareholders by keeping them off the company's books. Enron said
its earlier financial results, which it restated Nov. 19, aren't
reliable.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the first attempt to quantify the amount of the
off-balance-sheet financing," said Richard Miller, general counsel
for Dallas-based Exco Resources Inc., an Enron creditor.</LD>
<TE>   Enron, which filed the biggest U.S. bankruptcy ever in December,
is the target of more than a dozen investigations by the Securities
and Exchange Commission, the Justice Department and congressional
committees.</TE>
<TE>   The energy company's collapse cost 5,600 people their jobs. About
$78 billion in Enron's market value has been eliminated since August
2000.</TE>
<TE>   Houston-based Enron, which has no auditor since firing Arthur
Andersen, doesn't plan to provide 2001 financial statements because
it may not be "the best use of the company's resources," it said in a
report to the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Enron had intended to file corrected financial statements for last
year. Since the arrival of interim Chief Executive Stephen F. Cooper,
managers determined it was more important to work on the bankruptcy
proceedings, developing a reorganization plan and cooperating with
government probes and civil litigation.</TE>
<TE>   If Enron were to file financial statements, the company said it
would have to write down assets by about $14 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Enron said it might require an additional
$8-billion-to-$10-billion write-down relating to financial
instruments used in its trading business, which has since been sold.</TE>

<HD>Restructuring Reduces Allergan Profit</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: The drop-off comes despite a 9.1% increase
in sales of the company's drugs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Allergan Inc. said first-quarter profit fell because of costs for
restructuring and the spinoff of the drug maker's business that makes
contact lens products and eye surgery devices.</LD>
<LD>   Net income fell to $43.8 million, or 33 cents a share, from $52.1
million, or 39 cents, a year earlier. Sales increased 9.1% to $432.2
million from $396.1 million on greater demand for glaucoma,
muscle-spasm and dermatology drugs.</LD>
<LD>   Irvine-based Allergan last week won U.S. approval to market
Botox--a medicine for treating muscle spasms--for use in smoothing
forehead wrinkles, a use that analysts said may increase demand.
Botox sales rose 31% to $88.6 million in the first quarter. The
company is spinning off its contact lens products and eye surgery
devices business to focus on its faster-growing pharmaceutical
business.</LD>
<TE>   "The pharmaceutical sales are really good," said Morgan Stanley
analyst Marc Goodman, who rates Allergan "overweight" and doesn't
hold its shares.</TE>
<TE>   Sales in the firm's specialty pharmaceutical unit rose 15.6% to
$318.2 million, led by Botox and the glaucoma medicines Alphagan and
Lumigan. Botox already was approved to treat a disorder of the eye
muscles and the pain of a head-and-neck disorder called cervical
dystonia. Doctors had been administering the drug, a refined form of
the deadly botulinum toxin, for cosmetic purposes in so-called
off-label use.</TE>
<TE>   Sales in the optical device unit Allergan is spinning off fell
5.6% to $114 million.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Allergan fell $1.87 to $67 Monday on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Andersen Thwarts Volcker, Hires Specialist</HD>
<DH>Accounting: The firm looks to Bryan Marsal as chief
restructuring officer to reduce costs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The accounting firm Arthur Andersen said Monday that it hired a
restructuring expert, while former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A.
Volcker conceded that he has been unable to take charge of the firm
and launch his rescue effort because of internal conflicts.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen hired Bryan Marsal as chief restructuring officer. He is
a corporate reorganization specialist whose New York-based firm,
Alvarez &amp; Marsal, counts the bankrupt maker of Calvin Klein jeans
among its clients.</LD>
<LD>   "He was brought on at the end of March to help Andersen
restructure to reduce costs and to help re-engineer the firm to fit
with the Volcker plan," said Dan Hill, an Andersen spokesman.</LD>
<TE>   Though Marsal has worked extensively with insolvent companies,
Hill said his hiring did not foreshadow an Andersen bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Others familiar with Andersen suggested that Marsal's primary job
will be to oversee the orderly dismantling of the partnership, which
is disintegrating piecemeal as hundreds of clients defect and its
partners look to join rival firms. It announced a layoff of 7,000
employees, or nearly 30% of its work force, earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   Volcker said his efforts to transform Andersen into a smaller,
audit-oriented firm have been stymied by the company's inability to
cut deals with federal prosecutors and civil litigants, and a lack of
support by the firm's partners.</TE>
<TE>   The latest round of talks with the Justice Department to settle an
obstruction of justice charge--as well as talks with attorneys
representing Enron Corp. investors in a massive class-action
lawsuit--ended last week without agreements.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether he planned to abandon his efforts to save Andersen,
Volcker said his future with Andersen hinges on clear support from
the partnership and resolution of civil and criminal
litigation--conditions he set down when he made his offer.</TE>
<TE>   "If they tell us the conditions aren't there, then we won't take
control," said Volcker, chairman of Andersen's independent oversight
board. "It is not a matter of [my] resigning from anything. The
partnership needs to act before my board can act."</TE>
<TE>   In February, Andersen asked Volcker to take charge of a special
independent panel that would be empowered to make changes in the
accounting firm's management structure and business practices in the
wake of the Enron scandal.</TE>
<TE>   On March 22, Volcker offered to take control of the firm (with the
help of his outside board) as it reeled from the criminal indictment
for destroying documents sought in the federal probe of its
accounting for Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Six days later, after the resignation of Andersen Chief Executive
Joseph F. Berardino, the firm's partnership said it would adopt
Volcker's reform package.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Volcker said control of the firm still resides with U.S.
managing partner Larry Gorrell and others.</TE>
<TE>   Volcker proposed splitting Andersen into separate accounting and
consulting companies to avoid conflicts in which auditors overlook
irregularities so as not to lose lucrative consulting work. He wants
the firm to focus on the auditing and tax preparation disciplines
that are the traditional functions of the industry.</TE>
<TE>   This action, combined with a mandatory rotation that would switch
lead partners on each audit every five years, are intended to
transform Andersen into what Volcker calls a "reformed accounting
firm" that would become a model for the industry.</TE>
<TE>   To date, Volcker has not become involved in the inner workings of
the partnership or entered into the sensitive negotiations with
federal prosecutors and civil litigants.</TE>
<TE>   Following Andersen's indictment and the guilty plea on an
obstruction of justice charge by David Duncan, the senior partner on
the Enron account, many partners decided Volcker's plan was doomed,
according to people inside the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Hill, however, said Monday that the firm remains committed to the
Volcker plan.</TE>
<TE>   He said the transactions under negotiation, such as an agreement
to sell about half of the tax practice to Deloitte &amp; Touche, are
within the spirit of the plan.</TE>
<TE>   "The firm is aggressively pursuing the reforms that Mr. Volcker
intended," Hill said. "We think it is the right thing."</TE>
<TE>   Yet others, including Volcker, questioned Andersen's commitment.</TE>
<TE>   "Andersen invited Volcker in and said that it would take immediate
and strong action on what he recommended, but there was little to
indicate that's what they did," said Art Bowman, editor of Bowman's
Accounting Report, a trade publication.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly every major office and practice group within the U.S. are
negotiating deals to merge with rival firms, according to people
involved in the negotiations. Much of the Los Angeles office and the
Southern California operations are expected to land with either KPMG
or Deloitte &amp; Touche.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen faces billions of dollars in claims for a series of
audits, including its work for troubled energy trader Enron, the
Global Crossing telecommunications concern and the Baptist Foundation
of Arizona investor fund.</TE>
<TE>   Bowman believes any money Andersen raises from the sale of offices
and practices will go to pay litigants' claims.</TE>

<HD>Bank Freeze Brings Standstill</HD>
<DH>S. America: Argentine Congress will consider bill that
would change deposits to bonds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES</DL>
<LD>Argentines combed the streets for the few ATMs that were still
dispensing cash Monday, the first day of an indefinite bank holiday
ordered to prevent a collapse of the country's financial system.</LD>
<LD>   The government, warned by the International Monetary Fund again
this weekend that it must stop runaway spending to merit desperately
needed aid, rushed a bill to Congress to convert bank deposits into
government bonds.</LD>
<LD>   The aim of the vastly unpopular plan is to halt withdrawals of
cash from banks by depositors panicked by a tumbling currency and the
specter of more political and economic chaos, with a four-year
recession showing no sign of ending.</LD>
<TE>   Latin America's No. 3 economy is in total disarray after a 10-year
currency peg--which fixed the peso at one to the dollar by law--was
scrapped in January. Credit has dried up since Argentina defaulted on
its sovereign debt.</TE>
<TE>   "The bond switch is definitely the lesser of two evils since the
alternative was a total collapse," said a Wall Street banking
analyst. "This may save the banks. It's just a shame that the
government took so long to do the inevitable."</TE>
<TE>   The peso has now fallen to over 3.0 to the dollar and currency
fears have brought soaring inflation to a population of 36 million
people that expresses its anger in daily protests against politicians
widely seen as corrupt and ineffective.</TE>
<TE>   The main parties of Congress have promised to pass the main points
of the bill, which would allow banks to return an estimated 60% of
savings in bonds rather than cash.</TE>
<TE>   Small opposition parties planning to vote against it accused the
government of "blackmail" for forcing Congress to rush through the
bill or answer for chaos in the real economy.</TE>

<LD>   The Calabasas Hills-based chain's strategy of serving huge
portions, offering variety and opening restaurants in affluent
neighborhoods will no doubt be tested in the midst of a sluggish
economy and declines in eating out.</LD>
<LD>   The chain of 52 Cheesecake Factory outlets and two upscale Grand
Lux Cafe restaurants hopes to open 11 namesake outlets and one Grand
Lux by year-end. Chief Executive David Overton recently said the
company could grow to 200 restaurants in the U.S., up from a previous
estimate of 150.</LD>
<TE>   Cheesecake Factory executives said the time is right to expand,
because consumers have a big appetite for its offerings. The typical
outlet generates annual revenue of $11million, more than four times
the average for a casual-dining restaurant, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've basically been able to open our doors and customers would
come," said Jerry Deitchle the company's chief financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   Cheesecake Factory's strong sales and profit in both sweet and
sour times have made its stock attractive. The company's shares, up
71% in the last year, hit a record high of $41.35 during trading
Monday, although they closed at $40.13, down 2 cents on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   However, some industry watchers think the stock is overpriced,
selling at about 40 times estimated 2002 earnings per share.</TE>
<TE>   R. Scott Tilghman, an analyst at Ladenburg Thalmann in New York,
said Cheesecake will have difficulty maintaining its historical
revenue and earnings growth of 25% or more, partly because it can't
open new stores fast enough. If sales and profit growth sag, Wall
Street could hit the stock, which Tilghman rates "market perform" and
values at about $30.</TE>
<TE>   Many restaurant companies have scaled back expansion plans or are
growing more cautiously in the face of economic uncertainty and
rising unemployment, said Tim Carlin of Technomic Inc., a restaurant
consulting firm in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Outback Steakhouse Inc. plans to open as many as 64 Outbacks in
2002, down from 80 last year, according to regulatory filings. Mark
D. Kalinowski, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, attributes the
slowdown partly to the economy. The Tampa-based company declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Briazz Inc. plans to christen six restaurants this
year, about half as many as originally expected, CEO Victor D.
Alhadeff said. The Seattle-based company, which has 43 outlets in
four markets including Southern California, has scaled back because
sales and profit are down and capital is difficult to obtain on
favorable terms.</TE>
<TE>   Restaurants that roll out in tough times risk "falling on their
face" should the economy worsen, said Hal Sieling, a Carlsbad
restaurant consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the potential roadblocks, analysts said the Cheesecake
Factory's expansion makes sense, given its popularity and track
record with new stores.</TE>
<TE>   Because the chain is such a strong draw to a retail location,
landlords often reduce rents and pick up part of the tab for the
construction of new restaurants, said Lynne Collier, an analyst with
Stephens Inc. in Dallas. They are likely to be even more generous in
these tough economic times, with the softening commercial real estate
market.</TE>
<TE>   With strong cash flow and no debt, Cheesecake Factory has the
resources to expand without overextending itself, said Allan Hickok,
an analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray.</TE>
<TE>   "They've opened more than 50 restaurants and never had a clunker,
not even close," he said. "That's simply amazing."</TE>
<TE>   For new locations, Cheesecake Factory targets affluent areas with
200,000 people within a five-mile radius. About three-fifths of its
stores are in malls. The cost of putting up a new outlet is
$4.5million to $5 million; landlords typically pay 30% to 40% of
that, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   The 24-year-old chain's success also reflects a boom in the
casual-dining sector, where the average check ranges from $8 to $20,
said Collier, the Stephens analyst.</TE>
<TE>   Casual-dining stocks, which include such strong performers as P.F.
Chang's China Bistro Inc. and Darden Restaurants Inc., the operator
of Red Lobster and Olive Garden, have jumped by 50% in the last six
months, compared with a 5% increase by the Standard &amp; Poor's 500,
Collier said.</TE>
<TE>   Several factors are driving the growth of casual-dining
restaurants. The population of middle-aged people, the sector's core
clientele, is growing at a faster rate than that of young people. And
after years of burgers and fries, many Americans are suffering from
"fast-food fatigue," said Harry Milling, an analyst with Morningstar
Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Americans like their meals big, and that's exactly how Cheesecake
Factory serves them. Its Famous Factory Meatloaf, which weighs 15
ounces and comes with three-quarters of a pound of mashed potatoes,
and its 12-ounce Classic Burger, served with fries, help it stand out
in a crowded restaurant market.</TE>
<TE>   With more than 250 items featured on its 18-page menu, including
38 types of cheesecake, the restaurant offers "something for
everyone," said Howard Gordon, senior vice president of business
development and marketing for the company.</TE>
<TE>   Cheesecake Factory, unlike almost all its competitors, does no
advertising, relying instead on word-of-mouth, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Judging by the long waits for seats at lunch and dinner, it
appears to have struck a chord with consumers, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Stanley Apollo, a Westminster resident who visits a Cheesecake
Factory about once every couple of weeks, said he eats early, at 5
p.m., to avoid the dinner rush.</TE>
<TE>   "I plan on going there forever," said Apollo, 71. "There isn't
anything I don't like about the place."</TE>

<HD>Ethical Lapse by Power Grid Trader Revealed</HD>
<DH>Energy: Congressman says situation may indicate that
state's electrical system lacks independence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A trader for California's grid operator dangled inside information
and aggressively pressed an Enron Corp. electricity trader to help
set a high price for power July 3, but the Houston energy firm did
not fully cooperate, according to a transcript of the conversations
released Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. Doug Ose (R-Sacramento) asserted that the incident, which led
to the firing of the trader for the California Independent System
Operator, was not the isolated action of a misguided employee, as
Cal-ISO has portrayed it. Ose, chairman of the House subcommittee on
energy policy, said the incident shows that the grid operator is not
independent enough from state influence and called on federal
regulators to investigate.</LD>
<LD>   Cal-ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle said the agency is
continuing its own investigation of the matter but believes that the
trader was not influenced by the state Department of Water Resources,
the state's primary electricity buyer, which was trading on the
Cal-ISO floor at the time.</LD>
<TE>   DWR has been accused of manipulating state energy supplies to
reduce the loss the state has incurred because it bought too much
power through long-term contracts--charges the state agency has
denied.</TE>
<TE>   DWR traders were evicted from the Cal-ISO trading floor in
September out of concern that the state traders might have access to
secret bids into markets run by Cal-ISO for power needed the next day
or the next hour.</TE>
<TE>   "This incident shows the dangers of an electricity market where
the state controls both the power switch and is the largest single
purchaser of power," Ose said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   A Federal Energy Regulatory Commission spokeswoman said Ose's
request is under review.</TE>
<TE>   Cal-ISO revealed the ethical breach on April 9 and said that it
fired the unidentified employee.</TE>
<TE>   The trader told Cal-ISO officials that he was attempting to bring
down overall electricity prices by soliciting a bid from Enron of
$91.86 per megawatt-hour for a type of backup electricity known as
standby power. It is a payment to a generator to produce a certain
amount of electricity on one hour's notice.</TE>
<TE>   The trader said he was trying to mitigate an apparently legal
practice by power sellers of reaping profits by playing Cal-ISO's
hour-ahead market off its day-ahead market.</TE>
<TE>   On July 3, the Cal-ISO trader revealed secret bidding information
by telling an Enron trader that four sellers were trying to buy
excess standby power in the hour-ahead market for 1 cent per
megawatt-hour, according to the transcript released Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Those same sellers had sold the standby electricity to Cal-ISO the
day before for more than $90 a megawatt-hour, according to the
transcript uncovered by state Sen. Joseph Dunn (D-Garden Grove) as
part of his investigation into market manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   The Cal-ISO trader asked Enron trader Ryan Slinger to extend a
$91.86-per-megawatt-hour bid that the company had made earlier in the
day so that competing bidders for the reserve power would be forced
to pay at least that much to buy back their standby power, according
to the transcript. When Enron did not make the bid, the Cal-ISO
trader called to press the matter again.</TE>
<TE>   Slinger was reluctant to go along with the plan. Enron ended up
submitting a $91.86-per-megawatt-hour bid for one hour.</TE>

<CX>   Power bidding--A story in Tuesday's Business section about an
electricity trader for California's grid operator who shared secret
bidding information with an Enron Corp. trader should have made clear

<HD>Leisure Fare Hike Collapses</HD>
<DH>Travel: The airlines' attempt to raise prices fails as
Northwest refuses to do the same.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Major airlines' effort to add $20 to leisure fares collapsed for the
second time in two weeks Monday after Northwest Airlines again
refused to follow the hike.</LD>
<LD>   American Airlines began the latest fare increase late Thursday
with a $10 fare increase each way on discounted fares. Continental
Airlines Inc., Delta Airlines Inc. and US Airways Group Inc.
followed, with America West increasing some fares in selected
markets.</LD>
<LD>   But Northwest and United refused to match the hike and American
repealed it Sunday to remain competitive. Other carriers did the same
Monday.</LD>
<TE>   "The only question left now is whether the major airlines will
attempt for a third time this week to raise leisure fares," said Tom
Parsons, who watches fares as chief executive of Bestfares.com.</TE>
<TE>   The news helped contribute to a broad decline Monday among airline
stocks.</TE>
<TE>   America West plunged 14% after the company acknowledged Friday
that rivals had dropped business fares from America West's three hubs
to retaliate against the company's recent fare restructuring. America
West Holding Co. ended down 72 cents to close at $4.40 Monday on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of American parent, AMR Corp., fell 66 cents to $21.74;
Continental was down $1.85, or more than 6.6%, to $26.05; and Delta
lost 97 cents to close at $28.10. United parent, UAL Corp.'s shares
were off 54 cents to $14.46 and Southwest Airlines Co. was down 68
cents to $18.25. Northwest Airlines Corp. fell nearly 5%, or 98
cents, to close at $19.16 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Continental led a similar fare hike but had to
rescind it after Northwest declined.</TE>
<TE>   Carriers always need several attempts to make a fare hike stick,
with future increases likely to be successful, said Mike Linenberg, a
Merrill Lynch airline analyst.</TE>

<HD>HP Lawsuit a Test of Investors' Power</HD>
<DH>Courts: Director's action challenging company's conduct in
merger process could rein in corporate managers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WILMINGTON, Del.</DL>
<LD>In a showdown that could have far-reaching effects on the power of
shareholders to stand up to corporate executives, Hewlett-Packard Co.
begins a court battle today over its bitterly contested plan to
acquire Compaq Computer Corp.</LD>
<LD>   "This is potentially a historic event," said Rob Enderle, an
analyst with Giga Information Group. "Investors all over the country
are looking closely at this case," with an eye toward reining in
corporate managers who in recent years have become used to operating
with near impunity.</LD>
<LD>   HP declared victory last week in the shareholder vote to approve
what would be the largest technology merger in history at $19
billion. But that outcome has been challenged by dissident company
director Walter Hewlett, a major shareholder and son of late company
co-founder William Hewlett. He claims HP officers bought votes and
lied about the risks and benefits of the merger plan.</LD>
<TE>   If HP loses in court, the vote could be invalidated--an outcome
that experts said could lead to a substantial shift in the balance of
power between shareholders and corporate managers. An HP defeat,
Enderle said, "would establish new standards for corporate conduct,
and you can expect the [Securities and Exchange Commission] to drive
those standards hard."</TE>
<TE>   The trial, expected to last three days, is taking place before
William Chandler III, chief judge of Delaware's Court of Chancery.
The court is a primary venue for resolving business disputes because
more than half of Fortune 500 companies are incorporated in Delaware.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, the Chancery Court has strongly supported management
rights but recently has been moderating that stance, said Charles
Elson, director of the Center for Corporate Governance at the
University of Delaware.</TE>
<TE>   "Chandler strikes a very good balance between management
prerogatives and shareholder prerogatives," he said, adding that the
HP case "could draw a clear line between persuasion and coercion" in
proxy fights.</TE>
<TE>   In the post-Enron environment, legal authorities are carefully
scrutinizing corporate behavior considered routine only a few months
ago. Even relatively modest accounting or reporting irregularities
are receiving close attention by courts and regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the SEC and the U.S. attorney's office for New York's
southern district opened investigations into Palo Alto-based HP's
actions during the Compaq merger effort. Legal experts said that the
probe by the U.S. attorney strongly suggests a criminal
investigation--a chilling prospect for corporate managers. If those
investigations end in sanctions against HP or its officers, it could
embolden shareholders of other firms to challenge powerful
executives.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite the fact that we know most mergers fail there's been a
lack of shareholder activism in questioning the logic of these
mergers," said David Yoffie, a professor at Harvard Law School. "This
case is really precedent-setting about the ability of shareholders to
question senior management."</TE>
<TE>   The Hewlett lawsuit, filed March 28, charges that HP management
"used HP corporate assets to entice and coerce certain financial
institutions" to vote in favor of merging.</TE>
<TE>   An egregious vote-buying incident, according to the lawsuit,
occurred shortly before the March 19 voting deadline, when HP
announced that a $4-billion line of credit would be co-arranged by
Deutsche Bank. Almost immediately after, Deutsche Asset Management,
the bank's investment unit, switched 17 million votes to favor the
merger. The U.S. attorney is looking into this case, as well as the
votes of Northern Trust Corp., another large shareholder.</TE>
<TE>   HP, Deutsche Bank and Northern Trust have denied wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   The preliminary vote count, expected to be finalized in the next
week, shows the merger winning by some 45 million votes, or about 3%
of the total. That margin would more than offset the Deutsche Bank
ballots if they are thrown out by the court.</TE>
<TE>   But Hewlett also accuses HP managers of making false and inflated
claims about the smoothness of the integration process and about
projected profit for the combined companies. He also charges that HP
dramatically underestimated the number of employees who would be
fired once the merger is consummated. If Chandler agrees that false
claims influenced the voting, he could invalidate the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Further ammunition was added to an already raging battle when a
voicemail message from Carly Fiorina, HP's chief executive and
architect of the merger, to Chief Financial Officer Robert Wayman was
somehow forwarded to a newspaper reporter two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We may have to do something extraordinary for [Deutsche Bank and
Northern Trust] to bring them over the line," Fiorina said.</TE>
<TE>   HP later confirmed the message's authenticity, but strongly denied
that it implied any improper actions. Fiorina, the first woman to
head one of the 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones industrial
average, will probably be called to testify during the trial.</TE>
<TE>   HP's handling of the process leading up to the vote may have made
the legal battle inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole sequence of events began with them going after
[Hewlett] personally," suggesting that he was a dilettante in a
public relations campaign widely estimated at costing upward of $150
million, Enderle said. Later, the HP board voted not to renominate
Hewlett for a board seat--his term ends this week.</TE>
<TE>   "They drove him to this. If they had taken a less aggressive path,
we likely would not be going through this today," Enderle said.</TE>
<TE>   Other observers pointed out that the high-priced campaign to tear
down Hewlett's arguments was surprisingly ineffective, because the
opposition to the merger was well founded.</TE>
<TE>   "This guy is not a kook," the University of Delaware's Elson said.
"He got half the vote."</TE>
<TE>   Investment analysts say that HP--whose shares dropped 42 cents
Monday to $18.27 in New York Stock Exchange trading--may be due for a
protracted period of business uncertainty.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Murphy, an investment fund manager and editor of the
California Technology Stock Letter, predicts that HP will prevail in
court. But he sold all his shares in the company last week.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't want to own it during the consolidation phase....
That's very difficult for any company and HP doesn't have a lot of
experience at acquisitions," he said.</TE>

<LD>Rivals rushed to follow Wells Fargo &amp; Co.'s lead when the bank last
November began opening accounts for Mexicans who have consular
identification cards. But even more intense competition is now at

customers to use telephones, the Internet and ATMs to transfer funds
to Mexico. It also will phase in acceptance of the matricula consular
IDs until they can be used to open accounts at all of its 4,200
branches nationwide.</LD>
<LD>   The Mexican government has advised its 48 U.S. consulates to
promote the IDs for the estimated 3 million undocumented Mexicans
living in the United States.</LD>
<TE>   Bank of America this year quadrupled its budget for advertising to
minority consumers to $40 million. A major ad campaign built around
the slogan "Creemos en ti," Spanish for "We believe in you," also is
being launched.</TE>
<TE>   Many banks, including some BofA branches, already open accounts
for Mexicans with consular cards, who must show a second ID--a
utility bill, for example--but not immigration papers. "We don't ask
any of our customers to demonstrate their legal status," said Wells
spokeswoman Mary Trigg.</TE>
<TE>   BofA's new programs, however, represent the clearest commitment
yet by the country's largest retail bank to serve Mexican immigrants,
who wire more than $9 billion a year home to relatives--and typically
have paid 10% of the wired amount in fees to do so.</TE>
<TE>   BofA's new SafeSend program will allow holders of checking
accounts or credit cards to set up separate accounts for transferring
funds, with personal codes to allow access by ATM, phone or online.</TE>
<TE>   Account holders can "load" the new accounts with up to $500 per
transfer, up to a $1,000 maximum every 30 days. Recipients in Mexico
will use cards and the account password to withdraw cash from 20,000
ATMs carrying the Star symbol--"just about every ATM in Mexico," said
BofA spokeswoman Leticia Aguilar.</TE>
<TE>   Users will pay a flat fee of $10 per transfer for BofA customers,
$15 for customers of other banks. An additional $2 is added for
currency exchange, so a BofA customer would pay $12 per
transaction--4% of a $300 transfer, 2.4% of a $500 transaction.</TE>
<TE>   Like Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp, Bank of America already sends
representatives to some Mexican consulates to sign up customers who
have new high-security versions of the consular cards.</TE>
<TE>   The consulate in Santa Ana, where BofA set up shop Monday, is
issuing 5,000 of the new cards per month, up from 1,800 a month of
the old cards.</TE>
<TE>   One reason for the cards' popularity is the growing number of
police agencies and governments that accept them as identification.
The Los Angeles City Council will consider doing so next month.</TE>
<TE>   But the biggest reason for the demand is U.S. banks' willingness
to accept the new cards, said Miguel Angel Isidro-Rodriguez, the
Mexican consul in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   Not only are banks usually cheaper than money-wiring services,
which Isidro-Rodriguez said can charge up to 25% in transfer and
foreign-exchange fees, but "it's really needed for people to be able
to establish credit," he said.</TE>
<TE>   About 25,000 Wells Fargo accounts have been opened with consular
cards since November. Wells, which sent funds to branches of the
Mexican bank Banamex until Citigroup Inc. bought Banamex recently,
will soon announce another partner, probably Bancomer.</TE>
<TE>   Even as BofA positions itself more aggressively against U.S.
competitors, however, a potentially more formidable rival is getting
ready to compete for the same customers: Banco del Ahorro Nacional
Servicios Financieros, or Bansefi, a government-backed Mexican bank
with a mission to serve the nation's poorest residents, is installing
an Internet-based money transfer system of its own.</TE>
<TE>   Bansefi plans to operate in partnership with North American credit
unions and small Mexican banks serving the huge rural populations
most likely to have family members working in the United States. It
and other new government-sponsored financial institutions designed to
serve the poor are part of Mexican President Vicente Fox's campaign
to push economic advantages down to the lower levels of Mexican
society.</TE>
<TE>   These banks currently serve about 3.5 million customers who
previously had no access to financial services. The goal is to
increase that number to 12 million by 2010, said Raul Medina-Mora,
managing director of Vision Consulting in Mexico City, which is
installing the Internet system.</TE>
<TE>   Funds transferred from the United States to Mexico via Bansefi's
system will be automatically routed into savings accounts at Bansefi
or the small banks that will use its system.</TE>
<TE>   Medina-Mora said the process is a way for the owners of the
accounts to save money on transfer fees. Most important, they will
begin building savings and establish credit records for the first
time--all goals of the Fox administration.</TE>

<HD>Micron to Buy Part of Hynix for $3.6 Billion</HD>
<DH>Technology: Acquisition would create the world's largest
chip maker that would control one-third of the global market for
computer memory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a long and uncertain courtship, Micron Technology Inc. agreed
Monday to acquire the bulk of South Korea's Hynix Semiconductor Inc.
to create the world's largest maker of memory chips in a deal worth
$3.6 billion in cash and stock.</LD>
<LD>   The union, which requires approval from antitrust regulators and
the creditors of financially ailing Hynix, would create a juggernaut
that would control one-third of the $11-billion global market for
computer memory.</LD>
<LD>   It also would further consolidate a troubled industry
characterized in recent years by plunging prices and tepid demand
from personal computer manufacturers.</LD>
<TE>   "Ten years ago, you had 10 to 11 suppliers accounting for 80% of
the business, and now you're down to three," said Dan Scovel,
semiconductor analyst at Needham &amp; Co. in New York, a technology
research and banking firm. "It's a tough business."</TE>
<TE>   If the Micron deal goes through, the other remaining major memory
makers would be Samsung Electronics Co., Micron and Infineon
Technologies.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement calls for Boise, Idaho-based Micron to issue
108.6million shares and pay $200million in cash for six facilities
that make dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, chips.</TE>
<TE>   Micron also would acquire a 15% stake in Hynix's business in Flash
memory and static access memory chips used in digital cameras,
portable music players and cellular phones.</TE>
<TE>   Micron has been unprofitable for three of the last four fiscal
years, losing $625 million in the last fiscal year that ended in
August.</TE>
<TE>   Micron's shares gained $1.40, or nearly 5%, amid an overall market
decline to close Monday at $30.90 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Hynix shares fell nearly 7% on the South Korean stock market as
investors feared the acquisition would leave them with little once
the company's creditors carve up the cash.</TE>
<TE>   The deal, in the works for the last four months and proposed
Monday in a memorandum of understanding, is far from certain. For
one, it requires the blessing of Hynix creditors, many of whom have
argued that the $3.6-billion price is $1 billion too low.</TE>
<TE>   The deal also needs approval from U.S. and South Korean antitrust
regulators who may balk at signing off on a company that would
control 34% of the global memory chip market.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials and industry analysts, however, were optimistic
that the deal would go through.</TE>
<TE>   "We're realistic enough to know that there are challenges ahead,
but we believe it's a good deal that benefits all parties," said Sean
Mahoney, spokesman for Micron, which operates two design centers in
California. "There will be hurdles to overcome, but getting to this
point has been a challenge in itself."</TE>
<TE>   John M. Geraghty, an analyst with Gerard Klauer Mattison in New
York, predicted the deal would survive regulatory scrutiny.
"Antitrust is usually a problem when someone controls the business
and makes obscene profits," he said. "No one has been making profits
in the DRAM business."</TE>

<HD>TRW Says It Will Open Books to Second Suitor</HD>
<DH>Aerospace: Northrop, which has bid $6.7billion for company,
refuses to sign agreement for similar access.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>TRW Inc. said Monday it had signed a confidentiality agreement to
open its books to a potential buyer other than hostile bidder
Northrop Grumman Corp.</LD>
<LD>   The defense contractor and auto parts maker did not reveal the
identity of the potential buyer.</LD>
<LD>   TRW made the announcement while responding to a statement from
Northrop that criticized it for placing restrictions on a similar
confidentiality agreement with Northrop.</LD>
<TE>   Northrop is pursuing a $6.7-billion bid for Cleveland-based TRW.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop said it would not sign the confidentiality agreement
because it contained "onerous restrictions."</TE>
<TE>   The Century City-based firm said the proposed agreement, which
would give it access to TRW's books, includes a so-called standstill
clause and other conditions having nothing to do with
confidentiality.</TE>
<TE>   Standstill agreements typically prevent an interested buyer from
pursuing a hostile bid should the target choose another suitor.</TE>
<TE>   They also impose certain limitations that ensure the company stock
will not find its way to a hostile bidder, Northrop in this case.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop's rejection of the agreement comes just two days before
TRW's annual meeting, where shareholders will vote on whether to give
the suitor access to the company's books.</TE>
<TE>   "We are deeply disappointed that Northrop Grumman has chosen to
negotiate the terms of our confidentiality agreement in the press,"
wrote William Lawrence, general counsel for TRW, responding to
Northrop's statement.</TE>
<TE>   Before the announcement, TRW closed down 9 cents at $53.51, and
Northrop closed up $1.92 at $114.16. Both are traded on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   TRW said it was not eager to get into an exclusive agreement with
Northrop just yet, saying last week it was willing to share its books
with other parties, thereby almost inviting a bidding war for the
company.</TE>

<HD>State Farm Won't Write New Homeowners Policies</HD>
<DH>Insurance: Company won't accept business in state because
of a huge surge in payouts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State Farm General Insurance Co., California's largest insurer of
homes, said Monday it will no longer accept new homeowners business
in the state because of a huge--and so far largely unexplained--surge
in payouts over the last two years.</LD>
<LD>   The company, which has watched its reserves against losses dwindle
and its financial-strength ratings decline, said it will continue to
cover its existing policyholders even if they move to new homes.</LD>
<LD>   "We're doing this to protect them," company spokesman Bill Sirola
said. "We're still strong, but not at the level we want. And we've
been paying $1.20 in claims and expenses for every dollar coming in."</LD>
<TE>   The shift won't affect the company's auto insurance business in
the state.</TE>
<TE>   State Farm General insures 20% of the state's homes, 1.5 million
policies in all. But after adding 40,000 new homeowner policies in
California last year, it will cede new business in the foreseeable
future to competitors such as Farmers Insurance Group and Allstate
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   With its exposure to natural disasters and a reputation for
generating expensive lawsuits, California has always been an
uncertain place for insurers. But it is also a market so huge that
most analysts believe other insurers will aggressively go after
business that State Farm gives up.</TE>
<TE>   "Traditionally that's what's happened," said Candy Miller, a
spokeswoman for the Insurance Information Network of California, a
trade group. "We're much too big a market to ignore."</TE>
<TE>   The number of individual claims made to State Farm has not risen
significantly, Sirola said, "but in the last couple of years the
average claim cost has gone up as much as 30% in some areas.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I could give a simple answer why, but I can't," he said.
The company believes a number of issues have boosted the average
claim, including:</TE>
<TE>   * Higher new and replacement construction costs. Builders are
operating at full tilt to satisfy the demand for new housing, Sirola
noted.</TE>
<TE>   * More expensive home amenities demanded by customers. "We
recognize that it's become standard in a lot of homes to have things
like marble countertops," Sirola said.</TE>
<TE>   * Higher water-damage costs. Water is necessary for mold to grow,
and mold-related health claims are the fastest-growing complaint of
homeowners--and the biggest uncertainty for insurers.</TE>
<TE>   State Farm doesn't break out mold claims, which have devastated
insurers in Texas. But they are clearly rising with no easy way to
forecast how high, the firm said.</TE>
<TE>   "Anecdotes from the field are that costs for mold remediation and
environmental air testing [for mold] are increasing far more than
anything we could have anticipated," Sirola said.</TE>
<TE>   The higher water-damage figures also may reflect changes in home
design such as washing machines on second floors and greater use of
wood floors, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Miller said State Farm's decision wasn't a surprise. "The
handwriting was on the wall" given rising awards in lawsuits combined
with mold liabilities, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation with mold is huge and unpredictable. Texas leads
the country but California's not far behind." There are 10,000
lawsuits currently pending in the state involving mold claims, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   State Farm described the retrenchment as temporary, though it made
no projections about when things might change. It has made similar
cutbacks before, putting a national limit on growth in the early
1990s after Hurricane Andrew, and adopting another no-growth policy
in California after the 1994 Northridge earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   State Farm General hadn't requested a California rate increase for
years, until its losses shot up. State regulators approved a 6.9%
increase late last year, another 6.9% hike early this year, and State
Farm has another request for 6.7% pending.</TE>
<TE>   But because it takes a year to phase in increases, the higher
rates are only starting to boost the company's premium income.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the California firm's policyholder protection fund--its
capital held in reserve against losses--has fallen from $605 million
to $425 million in two years, causing insurance safety-rating firm
A.M. Best to recently cut its rating on the company to B-plus from
the A level it has long held.</TE>
<TE>   The parent company, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. of
Bloomington, Ill., lost a record $5 billion last year, hammered by
increases in homeowner and auto claims as well as declines in
investment returns.</TE>
<TE>   The loss, on revenue of $40 billion, was the insurer's largest
ever. In 2000, State Farm had turned a profit of $400 million.</TE>
<TE>   Because it is a mutual insurer (owned by policyholders), State
Farm can't raise money by selling stock in the public markets when
its capital starts dropping, so it is forced to try to strengthen
itself by limiting risk, Sirola said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's certainly not natural for us, and it has very serious
implications for our agent contractors," Sirola said. "But even they
understand our financial necessity."</TE>

<HD>Supreme Court Weighs Tips</HD>
<DH>Restaurants: Justices appear to agree with IRS' method of
calculating Social Security taxes based on credit card receipts
instead of waiters' reports.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Restaurant owners may be facing a tab that will set them back a bit.</LD>
<LD>   The Internal Revenue Service wants restaurants to pay the 7.65%
Social Security tax on the wages, including tips, that are paid to
their waiters and bartenders. The tax collectors rely on credit card
receipts to figure how much the waiters are receiving.</LD>
<LD>   But the restaurant owners prefer to rely on notably unreliable
reports from the waiters themselves.</LD>
<TE>   The Supreme Court justices took up the issue Monday and seemed to
side with the IRS during the oral argument. The government has a
"strong legal position" since it relies on the more accurate figures,
said Justice Stephen G. Breyer.</TE>
<TE>   His colleagues agreed and said the tax law favored the
government's view. In 1999, the IRS said reported tips from
restaurants were $14.3 billion, an increase of nearly $6 billion
since tax collectors began relying on credit card slips.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the
owners of San Francisco's oldest Italian restaurant, Fior d'Italia.
Its judges said the IRS exceeded its authority by using estimates of
cash tips along with the credit card receipts to calculate the total
amount of tips received.</TE>
<TE>   But the Supreme Court took up the government's appeal in the case
of U.S. vs. Fior d'Italia, 01-463.</TE>
<TE>   This case concerns only the tax paid by the restaurants, not taxes
on tips to be paid by the waiters.</TE>
<TE>   Fior d'Italia is challenging an extra $23,000 Social Security tax
that was calculated on estimates. The intricate case hinges on an IRS
policy in which the agency levied Social Security taxes on audited
restaurants based on assumptions of the tips earned rather than the
actual amount.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not fighting over $23,000," said Bob Larive, co-owner of
the restaurant. "We're fighting something that is wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Larive and his supporters said the taxes should be based on
individual audits of the employees, not speculation.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials declined to comment. But in briefs to the high
court, the federal government said the IRS was authorized to estimate
the amount of Social Security taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Associated Press was used in compiling this report.</TE>

<HD>Yodeler Drops Lawsuit Against Yahoo</HD>
<DH>Copyright: The country and western singer and the Internet
portal reach a deal over the weekend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yodeler Wylie Gustafson, a country and western singer from Dusty,
Wash., said Monday that he was dropping a lawsuit accusing Yahoo Inc.
of poaching his three-note vocalization following what may have been
the fastest settlement in the West.</LD>
<LD>   News of Gustafson's $5-million lawsuit was carried around the
world Friday, prompting Yahoo to put its top lawyer on a plane for a
meeting in Los Angeles with the cowboy-poet's lawyer. His people had
a deal with their people by sundown Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "I am the happy yodeler," Gustafson said Monday. "I was surprised.
I said, 'Boy, that was fast.'''</LD>
<TE>   Gustafson agreed not to disclose how much Yahoo would pay him.
But, he said, it was "enough to feed my [10] hungry horses this
winter"--and then some.</TE>
<TE>   "While both parties had a reasonable basis for their beliefs, as
soon as Yahoo learned of the suit, the company responded promptly and
fairly," Yahoo said in a statement. "The Yahoo yodel, performed by
Gustafson and known and loved by millions around the world, will
continue to be used in Yahoo advertising and marketing."</TE>
<TE>   Gustafson said he may even make appearances on behalf of the
popular Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers said the suit may have been the first to attempt to
enforce a copyright on a yodel.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, this will make artists more aware and companies more
aware of the value of copyrights and the use of artists' creations,"
Gustafson said. "Anything with a musical melody is copyrightable.
It's not like I'm just yelling or screaming. There is a definite
musical structure to that yodel."</TE>
<TE>   Gustafson filed suit in Los Angeles last week after complaining in
letters to the Sunnyvale, Calif.-based company that they had used his
yodel in thousands of commercials without paying for it.</TE>
<TE>   Gustafson, who fronts the band Wylie &amp; the Wild West, has recorded
several albums, including "Total Yodel."</TE>
<TE>   As one of the few professional yodelers in the country, Gustafson
had commanded actors' union scale and residuals for performing in
commercials for Porsche, Taco Bell, Miller Lite and others when
yodeling was popular among advertisers in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   He agreed to give the then-starving Internet start-up a break in
1996 and accepted a flat $590 for recording one Yahoo commercial. But
when he heard his yodel on a Yahoo Superbowl commercial three years
later, he cried foul.</TE>
<TE>   Gustafson read news reports about his lawsuit on Web sites around
the world. "I got an e-mail from a friend in Germany who said they
played that yodel all the time over there," he said.</TE>

<HD>Messier Likely to Fend Off Ouster Bid</HD>
<DH>Media: Vivendi board is expected to back chair- man despite
outcry that sees him as a detriment to French culture.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>In the executive suite of Vivendi Universal's Paris headquarters
Monday, Chairman Jean-Marie Messier and his staff were making the
final arrangements for this week's crucial annual meeting.</LD>
<LD>   Across town at Vivendi's sprawling television facility, where
anti-Messier graffiti lines the halls, workers also are making final
preparations for the Wednesday meeting. But they are packing up
leaflets and T-shirts emblazoned with messages such as "Messier Super
Liar" and "Messier Go Away."</LD>
<LD>   So it goes in the worlds of French culture and entertainment.</LD>
<TE>   Messier, the American-loving leader of France's largest media
company, is sure to take a beating at the annual meeting. Socialists,
union members and cultural elitists, who fear he is turning their
nation's film industry into the cinematic equivalent of McDonald's,
are planning to gang up on him and ask that he be removed.</TE>
<TE>   A series of protests began a week ago when Messier fired the
popular head of Vivendi's Canal Plus subsidiary. Canal Plus is
France's largest pay TV network and finances most of the nation's
film production. Pierre Lescure, a former television anchor and
17-year head of Canal Plus is an icon of sorts in France, where he is
seen as the protector of things French in media and entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Messier probably will weather the storm and move ahead with his
dream of making Vivendi one of the world's mightiest media and
entertainment concerns, despite the anger some shareholders are
likely to vent during the annual meeting. Vivendi Universal shares
have dropped 35% this year amid concerns about Messier's leadership
and strategy.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Messier said he was unavailable for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Even his most vocal critics acknowledged Monday that their calls
for Messier to step down and Lescure to be reinstated are unlikely to
be answered. Sources at Vivendi say Messier continues to enjoy the
support of the board.</TE>
<TE>   Also helping turn his fortunes was Sunday's national elections.
The Socialists, Messier's most outspoken critics, are out. The
center-right wing, where he stands as a well-established member,
seems certain to win the runoff vote.</TE>
<TE>   The first round of presidential elections brought crushing results
for Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin and saw far-right candidate
Jean-Marie Le Pen finish second. Le Pen will face incumbent President
Jacques Chirac in the next round of elections.</TE>
<TE>   Though Chirac and Le Pen also had blasted Messier as a turncoat to
French culture, much of the fiercest criticism came from left-wing
politicians, including Jospin, who called on broadcasting regulators
to investigate the Lescure firing. Communist politician Robert Hue,
who lost badly in Sunday's election, even proclaimed himself the
"anti-Messier candidate."</TE>
<TE>   In the final days of the campaign, "L'affaire Lescure" as it has
come to be known, was central in the debate of an otherwise
uneventful campaign. And Vivendi protesters shared the front pages of
leading newspapers with the biggest stories of the day.</TE>
<TE>   But come Monday morning, all of France's attention shifted to the
election and Le Pen's unprecedented showing.</TE>
<TE>   Even at Vivendi's headquarters, among employees and customers at
the company's cyber-cafe, the talk was more about Le Pen than
Lescure.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the ongoing and planned protests show that Messier has been
unable to squelch the anger among Canal Plus die-hards over his
decision to fire Lescure.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, thousands of Canal Plus employees gathered at a rock
concert in Paris to protest Messier's leadership. Last week, 1,000
workers marched outside Vivendi's headquarters off the Champs-Elysees
to support Lescure.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, about 400 actors, including Catherine Deneuve and
Juliette Binoche, have signed a petition demanding Lescure remain.</TE>
<TE>   Messier argues that firing Lescure and bringing in a replacement
from a rival sports TV channel in France were necessary to stem huge
losses at Canal Plus.</TE>
<TE>   "To an American audience, it's a money-losing operation, so kill
the head of it," said Luc Hermann, a journalist who works with an
investigative program produced by Canal Plus.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the way he was killed that bothers us. [Lescure] was the
keeper of the Canal Plus spirit."</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to defuse the tensions, Messier called a group of top
union leaders, producers and writers to a Sunday night meeting at
which Messier gave assurances of continued support for Canal Plus and
its independence.</TE>
<TE>   Canal employees said the meeting was candid and courteous, but
vowed to continue their protests. "He listened to us and we listened
to him, but this changes nothing with the company," said Gerard
Chollet, leader of the largest union representing Canal Plus
employees.</TE>
<TE>   Nostalgia already is setting in.</TE>
<TE>   Alain Shabat, producer of "Burger Quiz," a Canal Plus game show in
which contestants compete for hamburgers, walked into the dark Paris
night Monday saying, "It's sad, because for 17 years it was a lot of
fun."</TE>

<LD>A consumer's guide to the best and worst of sports media and
merchandise. Ground rules: If it can be read, played, heard,
observed, worn, viewed, dialed or downloaded, it's in play here. One
exception: No products will be endorsed:</LD>
<LD>   What: "Your Brain Is a Muscle Too: How Student Athletes Succeed in
College and in Life"</LD>
<LD>   Authors: Vince Fudzie and Andre N. Hayes</LD>
<TE>   Publisher: HarperCollins</TE>
<TE>   Price: $24</TE>
<TE>   Since the 1980s, the number of books about the student-athlete
experience has grown, but many of the guides have missed the mark
because they failed to grab the attention of student-athletes
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   As former collegiate athletes, Fudzie and Hayes offer an insight
that's rarely provided. This is a guidebook for all high school and
collegiate athletes as well as their parents. Fudzie and Hayes break
down the process, from obtaining an athletic scholarship to selecting
an agent.</TE>
<TE>   The book deals with issues such as drugs, alcohol and sex that are
seldom written about for young athletes. Fudzie and Hayes tie their
facts with detailed accounts by former athletes who have had their
lives drastically changed as a result of drug or alcohol abuse. One
story is about former UCLA and Cleveland Brown safety Don Rogers, who
died of a heart attack after using cocaine in 1986. Rogers' brother,
Reggie, a former Detroit Lion defensive end, recalls events that led
to Don's death and Reggie's alcohol-related auto accident in which
three people died.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the best section is "Money Matters." It starts by discussing
scholarships, then explains how to create a budget and provides
financial tips, from keeping phone bills down to managing
investments.</TE>
<TE>   In the book's forward, Richard Lapchick, head of Northeastern
University's Center for the Study of Sports in Society, points out
how rare it is to find a book that discusses "dealing with the media
for athletes." He writes that there are only two black sports editors
on newspapers in major media markets and among the nation's 1,600
newspapers, 90% do not have an African American sportswriter.
Lapchick also uses statistics to encourage athletes to get the most
of their educational opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   The book will be featured at the Los Angeles Times Festival of
Books this weekend at UCLA.</TE>

<HD>Divac Is Prepared to Stick a Fork in Jazz</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mal Florence</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Sacramento Kings and Utah Jazz resume their best-of-five NBA
playoff series tonight, but why should they bother if Vlade Divac is
prophetic?</LD>
<LD>   After the favored Kings barely hung on to defeat the Jazz, 89-86,
in the first game Saturday, Divac told Scott Howard-Cooper of the
Sacramento Bee:</LD>
<LD>   "I think it was their best shot tonight, and they didn't win. So
they're done."</LD>
<TE>   Ah, bulletin-board material for the Jazz for sure. But Divac is
probably right.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who were the first UCLA and USC players ever selected
in the NFL draft?</TE>
<TE>   Wasted effort: Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle: "Guys
pitching to Barry Bonds these days look like hick-town mayors
throwing out the ceremonial first ball."</TE>
<TE>   More Ostler: "Fortunately, Tiger has the good grace not to refer
to the Masters field as 'My supporting cast.' If this were a musical
group, it would be Tiger Woods and the Yips."</TE>
<TE>   And, this: "The [NFL] draft has become so big, so invasive, so
annoying, that many people are moving to Canada to avoid it."</TE>
<TE>   Too close for comfort: Recruiting a free agent can be taxing in
the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   Seahawk Coach-General Manager Mike Holmgren told the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer about a player who two years ago was ready to sign
with the Seahawks, but changed his mind.</TE>
<TE>   "I was told at the last second that his wife couldn't live in the
same state with her mother-in-law."</TE>
<TE>   Dwindling talent pool: Cornerback Kris Richard was the first USC
player chosen in the recent NFL draft--in the third round. By
contrast, in 1968 USC had a record five first-round choices--linemen
Ron Yary, Mike Taylor and Tim Rossovich, running back Mike Hull and
receiver Earl McCullouch.</TE>
<TE>   Put-on tease: Comedy writer Jerry Perisho: "Luther College in
Decorah, Iowa, is trying to stop its seniors from participating in
their annual end-of-the-school-year nude soccer game. It's a weird
scene. When someone scores a goal, they run around and pull on a
shirt."</TE>
<TE>   Good advice: From the Yogi Berra file: "Never answer an anonymous
letter."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1952, pitcher Bob Cain of the St.
Louis Browns outdueled Cleveland ace Bob Feller, 1-0, in a
record-tying battle of one-hitters at Sportsman's Park in St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back again: On this day in 1955, the Chicago White Sox hit
seven home runs and tied a modern run-scoring record with a 29-6
victory at Kansas City.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Bruin running back Chuck Cheshire by the Detroit
Lions in the second round in 1936 and Trojan lineman Gil Kuhn in the
10th round in 1937 by the Brooklyn Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: A profile of ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr. in the
Gallery column of the San Diego Union-Tribune:</TE>
<TE>   * "He owns eight TVs and watches five at a time on football
Saturday and Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   * "In the weeks leading up to the draft, he goes to bed at 2 or 3
in the morning and gets up at 7 a.m."</TE>
<TE>   Briefing comment: He's a sick dude.</TE>

<HD>His Love for Kings Could Mean Losing Neighbors</HD>

<LD>Tom &amp; Aida, our odd, but really strange next-door neighbors, have
been acting a little more peculiar than they normally do.</LD>
<LD>   Aida is still dusting her car every day and Tom continues to play
Ping-Pong with himself in the garage--bragging that no one can return
his serve, but now they've begun to build a barrier of trash between
the two houses.</LD>
<LD>   They're also talking about moving, which means they might be
taking down the Christmas decorations any day now.</LD>
<TE>   Obviously something has changed, because usually Tom &amp; Aida are
waiting in front of their house to bother us when we get home, but
ever since I started talking Kings with them and our chances of
winning the Stanley Cup, they've disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   This makes them no different from the readers of this column since
I started writing about hockey. But it does seem a little extreme to
pick up and move because you don't want to live in the same
neighborhood as a King fan.</TE>
<TE>   I understand the concern about property values dropping, because
there's no question a man or woman walking around in a King sweater
is an eyesore. But I'm a sportswriter with the obligation not to be
biased, so I can't appear in public looking tacky, obnoxious and
goofy. I can only sleep in my King sweater in the privacy of my own
home, changing the number on the back of my jersey every so often to
give the wife a thrill.</TE>
<TE>   I DON'T want Tom &amp; Aida to move, of course, because like an old,
worn-out lumpy couch, we've broken them in and they're too old now to
throw noisy parties. But that will mean no longer rooting for the
Kings, and I don't know if I can do that.</TE>
<TE>   When I got to the Kings' practice facility Monday morning, and
walked up to Jason "Shaq" Allison, right away he could tell there was
something wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "Now what?" he said. I mentioned Tom &amp; Aida, and got the same kind
of puzzled look that Andy Murray must get when he tells Allison to
try to score.</TE>
<TE>   Now I congratulated Allison on getting lucky the other day in
Colorado and scoring, but then mentioned my concern about his sense
of direction after watching Monday's practice. One of his shots
shattered the protective glass on the side of the rink--30 to 40
yards from the net--which would be like watching Denver kicker Jason
Elam take aim at the goal posts and then boot the ball into the press
box.</TE>
<TE>   "I was aiming at the reporters," Allison said, and so I told him
to picture columnist Bill Plaschke playing goalie for the Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   As you know, I've been trying to get Allison, whom Murray likens
to Shaq, to score more. Apparently I'm not alone. "Shaq scored 25
last night," teased the Kings' Craig Johnson while I stood there
talking to Allison.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaq knows how to put it into the net," I told Johnson for
Allison's benefit, and Allison shot back, "That's all he can do."</TE>
<TE>   OK, so he was off target again, but I think I got him really fired
up.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I DON'T think the fact Allison had the Kings' first penalty of the
game had anything to do with our morning discussion, but he did seem
irritated.</TE>
<TE>   Allison's physical play, as it would turn out, would kind of
dictate the Avs' terms of surrender, and I guess I'm going to have to
figure out another way to really irritate him at this morning's
warmup for tonight's game.</TE>
<TE>   The first period ended 1-1, and if you were watching the game on
TV you might have missed it. The Kings passed out 19,000 stealth
purple-and-silver pompons to their fans. Every other hockey arena has
an intimidating backdrop of 19,000 agitated fans waving white
pompons, but in Staples Center--take my word for it, the fans were
waving as hard as they could.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IN THE second period the fans in Section 207 were promised hot
Krispy Kremes if Adam Deadmarsh scored. You can imagine how relieved
they must have been to learn the doughnuts didn't depend on Allison
scoring a goal.</TE>
<TE>   Allison and I, however, have been working on his game. I made a
manager out of Jim Tracy and a hitter out of Eric Karros, so Allison
was easy.</TE>
<TE>   I had him scoring 43 seconds into the second period--which would
prove to be the game-winner, and didn't even mind when he passed off
to Ziggy Palffy to give the Kings a 3-1 advantage. I don't expect him
to score every goal.</TE>
<TE>   (By the way, I'll probably need a vacation before trying to make a
hitter out of Tim Salmon, but I have that on my list.)</TE>
<TE>   Now after our guys scored, the crowd began chanting, "Patrick," to
make fun of the Avalanche goalie. And I would like to take this
opportunity to apologize to everyone for misspelling his name
earlier. I thought everyone was saying, "Waugh," but I'm told his
correct name is "Patrick Rwah."</TE>
<TE>   Waugh, Rwah or whatever, he isn't that good. Our guy is much
better, and he doesn't have to contend with Allison, who has to
please me, and Palffy, who keeps getting fed the puck by Allison. All
in all, I think we make a good team.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'M HAPPY to report center Ian Laperriere took no shots at his own
goalie in this game. That's how much the Kings improved from Saturday
to Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Dan Kelly:</TE>
<TE>   "If a reader needs to correct your spelling of Patrick Roy because
you're too busy eating pretzels rather than looking at the stat sheet
and seeing how his name should be spelled, you just made yourself
look really stupid by printing an e-mail that points out how dumb you
are."</TE>
<TE>   What do you think is going to happen when I print your e-mail?</TE>

<HD>Kings Look Out for No. 1</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's like the old Los Angeles stereotype coming to fruition.</LD>
<LD>   You know, the thing about there being no depth out here.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings are looking pretty shallow right now. It also looks as
though that's their only shot at winning this series.</LD>
<TE>   Can they knock off the defending Stanley Cup champion Colorado
Avalanche with only one line? If the first three games of this
series--including the Kings' 3-1 victory Monday night--are any
indication, that's how they plan to do it. They're all about Ziggy
Palffy, Jason Allison and Adam Deadmarsh.</TE>
<TE>   Zig, Zag and Tag.</TE>
<TE>   They've scored seven of the team's nine goals so far and had all
three at Staples Center in Game 3.</TE>
<TE>   "We're the guys that are supposed to score on the team," Allison
said. "More nights than not, we're the ones that should score the
goals. We're going out there and we're just trying to give our team
an edge."</TE>
<TE>   The Zigmeister did his thing early and often, scoring two goals
(Nos. 3 and 4 of the series).</TE>
<TE>   Allison weaved his way around, setting up shop behind the net and
deftly finding the cutting players-- usually Palffy. He got the
assist on both Palffy goals and scored one of his own.</TE>
<TE>   Deadmarsh was putting the hurt on everyone from Adam Foote to
Peter Forsberg. It's clear that Deadmarsh is over whatever strange
feelings he had about playing his former teammates after last year's
trade from Colorado. He's more aggressive, showing absolutely no love
for the Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   It's asking a lot to expect them to compete with a replenished
Colorado roster that can roll both Alex Tanguay, Joe Sakic and Radim
Vrbata, and Peter Forsberg, Chris Drury and Steve Reinprecht at you.</TE>
<TE>   King Coach Andy Murray must feel as if he has no choice. Assistant
Dave Tippett had Palffy, Allison and Deadmarsh together in the three
games he coached while Murray was recuperating from his automobile
accident and they scored five goals. But Murray split them up after
he returned in an attempt to bring more balance to the roster.</TE>
<TE>   Now that the playoffs are here they've reunited.</TE>
<TE>   "We just felt that we needed to have a unit that we could really
lean on," Murray said. "They played a couple of games near the end
where we put them together and I thought we would go to it. We just
felt it was a good combination and a good time to do it."</TE>
<TE>   They're saddled up and ready to be ridden. Hard.</TE>
<TE>   For a while, they were logging more ice time than a polar bear.
With a two-goal lead in the third period Monday night, Murray could
afford to send out the more defensive lines.</TE>
<TE>   Because for all of their scoring prowess, the only one of the
three with a positive plus/minus in the first two games was Palffy at
plus one. Allison, in particular, gave up a costly goal in Game 2
when he didn't react quickly enough on a rebound, let Forsberg beat
him to the puck and score to tie it at 3-3.</TE>
<TE>   But Allison made good things happen for the Kings on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   He dug the puck off the boards after an early faceoff and got it
to Palffy, who circled around the net and fired the puck past Patrick
Roy and the Kings were on the scoreboard faster than you can say
"Mikko Eloranta."</TE>
<TE>   Allison put the Kings ahead for good 43 seconds into the second
period, when he took a Palffy rebound and slid the puck by Roy.</TE>
<TE>   Deadmarsh assisted on Palffy's second goal, at 8:29 of the third.
He didn't get a shot, but he did get his shots in on the Avalanche.
He nailed Foote against the boards, setting off an early scrum. And
he combined with Philippe Boucher to sandwich Forsberg later.</TE>
<TE>   Everything about the line is clicking.</TE>
<TE>   "We're reading off each other pretty well right now," Deadmarsh
said. "My job is pretty simple. I just try to get the puck to those
guys."</TE>
<TE>   And get other guys out of the way. He occupied Foote, which freed
Palffy on the first goal.</TE>
<TE>   "What makes Ziggy so difficult is Adam and Allison are so strong
down low, you have to contend with them and that opens a lot of room
for Ziggy to operate," Foote said.</TE>
<TE>   Said King center Bryan Smolinski: "Anything can happen with them.
They've got three guys that can do it all. Both Jason and Deads are
physical guys. They're going to get it. And plus they can play with
the puck."</TE>
<TE>   Something about these Kings. For the last two years, whenever
they've been on the verge of missing the playoffs or losing a series,
they come out and play their best hockey.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been a resilient group," Murray said. "I would just as soon
come in here, 2-0.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's because we play hard. I think it's because we've
been known as a team over the last few years that plays hard."</TE>
<TE>   That playing hard stuff can get old though. It was like the
Philadelphia 76ers and all their talk about heart during last year's
NBA Finals--try winning some games for a change.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings were on the verge of missing out on all the fun.</TE>
<TE>   The Vancouver Canucks are halfway toward doing the unthinkable
against the Detroit Red Wings. Montreal and Boston are taking another
crack at each other in the most contested playoff rivalry in pro
sports.</TE>
<TE>   It seemed like the Kings' postseason was about to end before it
even began.</TE>
<TE>   "You play hard all year to get a chance to play in the playoffs,
you don't let it just slide away on you," Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   Zig, Zag and Tag aren't about to let it get out of their grasp.</TE>
<TE>   Is Murray concerned about being so one-dimensional?</TE>
<TE>   "Only when we lose," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Monday night, they didn't allow it to happen.</TE>

<LD>Since leaving Cuba, Danys Baez has acclimated to American life.</LD>
<LD>   He can't get used to the weather.</LD>
<LD>   "Never like Havana," Baez said, pulling on a turtleneck sweater.
"It was cold, but at least not snowing."</LD>
<TE>   Baez pitched 51/3 shutout innings in the chilly conditions and
Travis Fryman and Russell Branyan homered as the Cleveland Indians
ended a six-game losing streak Monday night, defeating the Chicago
White Sox, 4-2, at Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Finally home after going 0-6 and getting swept in Chicago and
Minnesota, the Indians improved to 7-0 at Jacobs Field and ended
their longest losing skid in two years.</TE>
<TE>   Baez, who defected from Cuba and lived in Costa Rica before coming
to Cleveland, didn't seem to be bothered by having to pitch in
temperatures that dipped into the 30s. He struck out a career-high
seven and walked one.</TE>
<TE>   Baez laughed when asked how cold it got in Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   "Seventy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After giving up two singles in the sixth, Baez was replaced by
Ricardo Rincon, who got Ray Durham to bounce into an inning-ending
double play.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Valentin's two-run homer in the seventh off David Riske got
the White Sox within 4-2, and Chicago put two runners on with two out
in the eighth. But Paul Shuey struck out Frank Thomas on a low pitch
to end the threat.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Wickman pitched the ninth for his sixth save.</TE>
<TE>   Kenny Lofton, who played nine seasons with the Indians, returned
for the first time with the White Sox and went one for three and was
thrown out trying to steal.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 6, Detroit 0--Paul Byrd pitched a six-hitter to
improve to 4-0 and lead the Royals at Kansas City. Byrd, who has all
but two of the Royals' victories, became the first Kansas City
pitcher to win his first four decisions since Bret Saberhagen started
6-0 in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd struck out four in his first shutout since last Aug. 17
against Houston. In 281/3 innings, the former Philadelphia Phillie
All-Star has not walked a batter.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Beltran had a homer and a double for the Royals, who got
four runs in the first off Mark Redman (0-3).</TE>

<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Closer Troy Percival threw nine pitches Sunday, when he blew the save
in the Angels' 6-5 loss to the Oakland Athletics. All but one pitch
was a fastball, and catcher Bengie Molina said Monday he believes
Percival ought to throw off-speed pitches as much as half the time.</LD>
<LD>   "I think that would be best for him," Molina said. "He has a very
good curve. I don't know if he has confidence in it. Hopefully, he
does. I'm going to start calling it more, and I hope he has the
confidence to throw it."</LD>
<LD>   Percival, who thrives on a fastball that approaches 100 mph,
acknowledged that he shook off several of Molina's calls for a curve
Sunday. Percival, uncomfortable with his command of the fastball,
also acknowledged he shook off Molina's calls for inside pitches.</LD>
<TE>   "Don't blame it on him," Percival said. "It was all on me. I
wasn't mentally sharp. The arm strength is great, but this is all
part of my spring training now, and unfortunately it was at the cost
of the team. I have no question I'll be back on top of my game in a
couple outings."</TE>
<TE>   Although seven of 11 batters have reached base against Percival
this season, pitching coach Bud Black said he is not concerned about
his closer, whose strained rib cage limited his activity in spring
training and forced him onto the disabled list five days into the
season.</TE>
<TE>   Black declined to second Molina's motion for Percival to throw
breaking balls as much as half the time, but Black agreed even a few
more curves would make Percival's fastball more effective.</TE>
<TE>   "No doubt Troy is a power pitcher. He's going to pitch with his
fastball," Black said. "But any element of doubt you can plant in a
hitter's mind is advantageous."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman Adam Kennedy ended last season in a platoon with
Benji Gil, and he appears to be starting this season in a platoon
with Jose Nieves. Kennedy hit .439 in spring training and won back
the everyday job, but with Kennedy off to a .208 start and the Angels
desperate for offense, Manager Mike Scioscia has replaced him with
Nieves in each of the past four games against left-handed starters.</TE>
<TE>   Is Kennedy disappointed?</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," he said, "but I haven't been swinging the bat well. I
haven't really given them much of a choice."</TE>
<TE>   In the spring, the Angels were enamored of the possibility of
promoting shortstop prospect Alfredo Amezaga and moving David
Eckstein to second base to replace Kennedy, but Amezaga is hitting
.203 at triple-A Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia had statistics on his side Sunday when he called for a
sacrifice bunt and ordered Jeff DaVanon to bat for designated hitter
Brad Fullmer. Turns out Fullmer's career bunt total is zero. Never in
five years in the major leagues and never in three years in the
minors has he executed a sacrifice bunt.</TE>
<TE>   Fullmer wasn't offended that Scioscia yanked him. If he were
hitting well, Fullmer figures, Scioscia would have disdained the bunt
with the hope that Fullmer would drive in one or both runners.
Fullmer entered Monday's game batting .212 with two runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   "I need to be swinging the bat well, so I hit in that situation,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're in the middle of the lineup, you want to swing the bat
well with runners in scoring position, and I haven't been."</TE>

<HD>Angels Take a Beating in Seattle, 16-5</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>April, in a snapshot: Angel reliever Lou Pote attempts a routine
pickoff throw to first base Monday. The throw sails high above the
head of first baseman Scott Spiezio and into the stands, on the fly.</LD>
<LD>   This is not to pick on Pote, mind you, merely to offer an
illustration of the state of the Angels, off to another awful start
and the prospect of another awful season.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels got pounded by the Seattle Mariners Monday, giving up
five home runs and falling behind, 8-0, en route to a 16-5 defeat
before 33,119 at Safeco Field. The Mariners batted around twice,
beating the Angels for the 20th time in 24 games and ascending 91/2
games above them in the American League West standings.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know, man. Those guys, they just don't miss," Angel
starter Scott Schoeneweis said. "You feel like you have to make a
perfect pitch.</TE>
<TE>   "I make a good pitch, and it gets hit. I make a bad pitch, and it
gets hit far."</TE>
<TE>   Mark McLemore, who made his major league debut for the Angels'
last division championship team in 1986, drove in five runs, best of
his career, including four on his first grand slam after 5,348
at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are 2-10 this season against Seattle and Oakland, the
teams that stand between them and their October dreams. They have hit
fewer home runs--and given up more home runs--than any other team in
the major leagues.</TE>
<TE>   If the Angels lose tonight, they will be 6-14. Never has an Angel
team started so poorly--not the expansion Angels of 1961, not the
95-loss Angels of 1980, not the Angels that finished 41 games out of
first place last year.</TE>
<TE>   "We've created a hole for ourselves," Spiezio said, "but I
believe--and I know a lot of us believe--we're capable of digging
ourselves out of it. Those are great teams we're playing, but there's
no excuse. We have to beat those teams to accomplish what we want to
accomplish."</TE>
<TE>   Just as a dormant offense displays signs of coming to life, the
Angels must concern themselves with deficiencies in the pitching
staff that was billed as a solid foundation for the team. Schoeneweis
did not survive the third inning Monday, and reliever Donne Wall
pitched to seven batters without recording an out.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, Angel Manager Mike Scioscia called Wall "a project
right now." It is possible the Angels could decide they cannot afford
to support a project at the moment and replace Wall with minor
leaguers Brendan Donnelly, Bart Miadich or Scot Shields. But the
pitching problems extend beyond one or two weak links.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have lost 11 of 14 games, and their earned-run average
is 6.07 over that span and 5.46 for the season. In addition to closer
Troy Percival, who has retired four of 11 batters this season, the
lofty ERAs include those of Wall (12.54), Ben Weber (5.00) and
three-fifths of their rotation--Schoeneweis (7.33), opening-night
starter Jarrod Washburn (5.48) and the Angels' $24-million,
free-agent signee, Aaron Sele (6.65).</TE>
<TE>   "Of all the parts of this club, the one we're very comfortable
with is the starting pitching," Scioscia said, "but that has not been
the case the past week."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels never gave up as many runs last season as they did
Monday. The last time they gave up more? September 2000, when the
Mariners--of course--scored 21. The Mariners scored early and often
Monday. The second batter, Jeff Cirillo, homered. On the next pitch,
Bret Boone homered.</TE>
<TE>   In the third inning, after Schoeneweis got the first out, the next
six hitters reached base. They all scored, four on the grand slam by
McLemore.</TE>
<TE>   Ruben Sierra homered in the sixth inning, and Ichiro Suzuki and
Cirillo homered on consecutive pitches from Wall in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners had 18 hits, including three apiece by Sierra,
McLemore and Carlos Guillen and two apiece from Cirillo and Suzuki.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners improved their record to 16-4, matching their pace of
a season ago. They set an American League record with 116 victories
last season.</TE>
<TE>   "They've picked up right where they left off last year,"
Schoeneweis said. "It's amazing to watch what's going on over there."</TE>

<KH>AROUND THE MAJORS</KH>
<HD>Cordero Designated for Assignment</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Outfielder Wil Cordero, a major disappointment for the Cleveland
Indians the last three seasons, was designated for assignment Monday.</LD>
<LD>   In six games, Cordero was batting .222 (four for 18) with one run
batted in.</LD>
<LD>   The Indians had been reluctant to play Cordero, 30, because of his
lack of productivity.</LD>
<TE>   He's in the final year of a contract that will pay him $4 million
this season.</TE>
<TE>   Indian General Manager Mark Shapiro said the club will try to
trade Cordero in the next week. If the Indians can't make a deal,
Cordero will be released.</TE>
<TE>   The Indians purchased the contract of first baseman Earl Snyder
from triple-A Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   Snyder, 25, came to Cleveland in the eight-player trade in
December that sent Roberto Alomar to the New York Mets. Snyder was
batting .250 with four home runs and seven RBIs in 16 games for the
Bisons.</TE>
<TE>   Cordero was in his second stint with the Indians. He signed with
Cleveland as a free agent in 1999 after playing for Montreal, Boston
and the Chicago White Sox. Cordero broke his hand at the end of the
2000 season.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, he batted .250--his lowest average since 1993--with one
homer and 21 RBIs in 268 at-bats. During one stretch, he went 86
at-bats without driving in a run, and before hitting his homer on May
16, he had gone 257 at-bats without one.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Atlanta Braves put starting pitcher Jason Marquis on the
15-day disabled list because of tendinitis in his right shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   The move is retroactive to April 15, the day after Marquis gave up
seven runs and 11 hits in six innings against the Florida Marlins.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves recalled left-hander Jung Bong, a 21-year-old native of
South Korea, from Greenville of the Southern League.</TE>
<TE>   Bong will make his major league debut today against Curt Schilling
and the World Series champion Arizona Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves will send right-hander Albie Lopez to Greenville for a
rehabilitation start today.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Texas Rangers acquired outfielder Calvin Murray from the San
Francisco Giants for cash. Murray, 30, will join the Rangers for
tonight's home game against Toronto. He hit .245 with six homers and
25 RBIs in 106 games with the Giants last season, including 73 starts
in center field.... New York Yankee pitcher Sterling Hitchcock
reported no problems after a 15-minute bullpen session at Tampa, Fla.
Hitchcock has been on the disabled list since the start of the season
because of a lower back strain.</TE>

<KH>PORTLAND NOTES</KH>
<HD>Cheeks Does Emotional Balancing Act</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maurice Cheeks played with Charles Barkley with the Philadelphia
76ers, served on Larry Brown's staff as an assistant in Philadelphia,
coaching Allen Iverson, and now he's in his first season as the coach
of the Portland Trail Blazers.</LD>
<LD>   Consider him something of an expert on emotional characters if you
must, but Cheeks said he doesn't see what others have seen in the
Trail Blazers.</LD>
<LD>   "All I can say is that things I've heard do not exist with me," he
said when asked about Portland's image as the Trail Gangsters. "Where
that rap comes from, I don't know. They all play hard for me. All a
coach can do is ask that his players play hard. Maybe the stuff with
all those technical fouls is part of it.</LD>
<TE>   "Somehow it's become part of our aura."</TE>
<TE>   Last season, power forward Rasheed Wallace set an NBA record with
41 technical fouls. He also was ejected seven times.</TE>
<TE>   During Game 2 of the Trail Blazers' opening-round playoff loss
last year against the Lakers, Portland drew five technical fouls in
the first quarter alone and Dale Davis was later ejected for throwing
an elbow at Robert Horry. Davis was suspended for Game 3 for his
actions, as was reserve Stacey Augmon, for leaving the bench in the
Davis aftermath.</TE>
<TE>   Cheeks gathered the Trail Blazers before the start of this
season's playoff matchup against the Lakers, delivering a stern
message to go easy on the referees.</TE>
<TE>   So far, so good. The Trail Blazers were on their best behavior
during their loss Sunday in Game 1.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that Cheeks wants the Trail Blazers to play without
emotion. He simply wants them to avoid going overboard. After all, as
Davis put it last week, "This is an emotional team, an emotional
group of guys."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Portland's Scottie Pippen helped the Chicago Bulls win six NBA
championships in the 1990s. So when somebody wanted to know his
impression of the two-time defending champion Lakers, he drew on an
obvious comparison.</TE>
<TE>   "They definitely have some arrogance about them," he said. "They
deserve to have some arrogance about them. They have a swagger about
them. They deserve to have it because they're winning games. To some
degree they are [like the Bulls of the 1990s].... Other than Shaq
[O'Neal], of course."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Overlooked statistics from Game 1: The Trail Blazers had 11
offensive rebounds in the first half and trailed, 46-44. They took
one in the second half and lost, 95-87.</TE>
<TE>   Overlooked statistics Part II: Portland missed its first seven
shots. The Trail Blazers also took five shots before the Lakers
attempted one.</TE>
<TE>   Elliott Teaford</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers will attempt to get more offensively out of
Pippen, Damon Stoudamire and Bonzi Wells in Game 2. The three
combined to shoot nine of 32 in the opener.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to get Bonzi down on the post," Cheeks said. "I don't
believe they really have a guy who can guard him down low."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Catchers Get the Credit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Starting pitching and mostly outstanding relief work have enabled the
Dodgers to begin tonight's six-game trip to Pittsburgh and Chicago
only 11/2 games behind first-place San Francisco in the National
League West.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers' 3.18 earned-run average ranks fifth in the National
League, and Dodger starters have given up two earned runs or fewer in
13 of the last 16 games.</LD>
<LD>   Much of the credit, Dodger pitchers say, goes to catchers Paul Lo
Duca and Chad Kreuter.</LD>
<TE>   Kreuter, in his 14th major league season, is a known quantity as a
backup.</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca, in his second season as the starter, has progressed
behind the plate.</TE>
<TE>   "Having been through the league once last year, I know the hitters
better," Lo Duca said. "It's a challenge, with some new pitchers on
our staff, but they have made it easy by throwing so well and
communicating with me."</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca, 30, spent all or most of eight seasons in the minor
leagues before breaking through last season. He batted .320 with 25
home runs and 90 runs batted in while playing four
positions--catcher, first base, left field, right field--and hitting
in six spots in the order. The Dodgers rewarded him with a
three-year, $7.25-million contract last February.</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca is batting .292 with eight doubles, a home run and six
RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Pitching coach Jim Colborn said Lo Duca's long journey through the
minor leagues has made him better than most second-year starting
catchers.</TE>
<TE>   "A young guy who comes up to the big leagues at 22 or 23, because
he has a great arm or is a great hitter, is going to have a lot to
learn when it comes to calling a game," Colborn said. "Lo Duca got a
lot of experience catching all kinds of guys in the minors.</TE>
<TE>   "When I pitched in the big leagues, I preferred to throw to the
backup catchers because they always knew what was going on. He's got
a backup's mentality, but he's a front-line player."</TE>
<TE>   Japanese left-hander Kazuhisa Ishii, who is 3-0 and will start
tonight against the Pirates, said he had no concerns about the
transition from the Japanese Central League to the majors because
he'd heard the Dodgers had good catchers.</TE>
<TE>   "Lo Duca and I have good timing together," Ishii said through an
interpreter. "Both he and Chad Kreuter have helped me adjust."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy is looking forward to playing outside the
division for the first time this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers play the Pirates and Chicago Cubs on this trip and
also have series against the Cincinnati Reds, Atlanta Braves, Florida
Marlins, New York Mets, Montreal Expos and Milwaukee Brewers before
playing the Arizona Diamondbacks on May 24 in Phoenix. They went 5-4
on their last trip, to San Francisco, San Diego and Colorado. They
finished their recent four-game homestand against the Padres, 3-1.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time we get back from a road trip where we've won more than
we lost, and we finish a homestand where we've won more than we've
lost, you get to the early and mid-part of August and look up and
those numbers will add up to something in the neighborhood of 18 to
25 games over .500," Tracy said. "That's what you're striving to do
here."</TE>

<TE>   Update--After playing 19 games against National League West

Colorado Rockies as he had been in his first two outings against the
Rockies and San Diego, but he remained unbeaten with a good
performance at Coors Field. The surprising Pirates, who lost 100
games last season, are coming off a three-game sweep of the
Philadelphia Phillies, the first time that has happened since 1992.</TE>

<KH>KING REPORT</KH>
<HD>Murray Benches Bednar, Visnovsky</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe; Chris Foster</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>King Coach Andy Murray altered his lineup for Game 3 against the
Colorado Avalanche, benching winger Jaroslav Bednar and defenseman
Lubomir Visnovsky in favor of Nelson Emerson and Andreas Lilja.</LD>
<LD>   Emerson, 34, had not played since March 30 and had been in the
lineup only three times in 19 games. He last registered a point March
16.</LD>
<LD>   Lilja, a 26-year-old rookie, had played in two games since Feb. 7.</LD>
<TE>   "We think Lilja is stronger physically," Murray said of the switch
to the 6-foot-3, 220-pound Lilja over the 5-10, 180-pound Visnovsky.
"We're wanting to be better on the defensive side of our game,
although we think Visnovsky when he's playing [well] is very
effective because he moves the puck effectively out of our zone."</TE>
<TE>   But Visnovsky, he said, did not play well in Games 1 and 2.</TE>
<TE>   "We just didn't think his game was at the level we wanted to have
it," Murray said before the game, "so we're going to give him a break
tonight. We expect Lilja to come in and play very good defensively
for us."</TE>
<TE>   Of Bednar, a 25-year-old rookie, Murray said: "We thought he was
very good in the first game and then we didn't see him at all in the
second game."</TE>
<TE>   Emerson, who played in a career-low 41 games this season, is a
veteran player, Murray said, "who in this situation deserves to show
us what he can do."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Winger Ted Donato, who played most of the season with the Kings'
American Hockey League team at Manchester, N.H., was named to the
U.S. team that will compete in the world championships starting
Friday in Sweden.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Of Avalanche captain Joe Sakic, who scored three goals in the
first two games of the series, Murray said, "He's one of those guys
like [Mike] Modano [of the Dallas Stars]. Every time he gets the
puck, your heart kind of jumps to your throat....</TE>
<TE>   "To me, in the last year, he's been the best [player] in hockey.
He won the MVP of the league last year. He won a Stanley Cup. He won
an Olympic gold medal. He was the MVP of the Olympics. You can't help
but be impressed with what he's done."</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Crowe</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Peter Forsberg, who missed the entire regular season, will test
his stamina tonight in the second of back-to back games.</TE>
<TE>   To accommodate television, the Kings and Avalanche will play on
consecutive nights. Forsberg, who had a goal and four assists in the
first two games of the series, was concerned about the strain on his
body.</TE>
<TE>   "My legs felt better last game, but this is going to be tough. But
it will be tough on everyone," Forsberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Forsberg has had four surgeries in the last year and, until
Thursday, hadn't played since Game 7 of the Western Conference
semifinals against the Kings last May.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't think I have played well enough to have five
points," Forsberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, such statements leave his teammates smiling.</TE>
<TE>   "That works well for Peter that people think he's not 100%,"
defenseman Adam Foote said. "Peter at 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, whatever,
is still better than almost everyone else out there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The chances of Colorado's Milan Hejduk playing in this series are
growing slimmer.</TE>
<TE>   Hejduk, out since Feb. 28 because of an abdominal strain, had an
extended workout after the Avalanche's morning skate Monday. But
Coach Bob Hartley indicated that Hejduk's return was still at least a
few days off.</TE>
<TE>   "His speed has picked up and his stride is better," Hartley said.
"But he is not where we want him to start doing contact drills."</TE>
<TE>   There was no urgency to get Hejduk back in the lineup after his
teammates scored nine goals in the first two games of the series.</TE>
<TE>   The concern was greater before the playoffs, as the Avalanche had
a franchise-low 212 goals this season.</TE>
<TE>   Hejduk scored 41 goals last season and had 21 before being injured
against Phoenix this season. But with the Avalanche scoring goals and
winning in the first two games, he will likely be held out until the
conference semifinals, unless the series turns the Kings' way.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's getting his jump back on the ice," Hartley said.
"Hopefully, we'll get him into a full-contact practice soon."</TE>

<KH>STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS KINGS 3, COLORADO 1</KH>
<HD>Rescued by a Live Line</HD>
<DH>Game 3: Palffy has two goals and top line does all the
scoring in L.A.'s season-saving victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Doing their part to make a difference on Earth Day, the Kings
recycled a winning formula from the regular season Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   In the process, they saved their season from the junk heap.</LD>
<LD>   Combining the offensive brilliance of Ziggy Palffy and Jason
Allison with tight-checking defense and stellar goaltending by Felix
Potvin, the Kings defeated the Colorado Avalanche, 3-1, in Game 3 of
their first-round Stanley Cup playoff series.</LD>
<TE>   Palffy contributed two goals and one assist, Allison had one goal
and two assists and Potvin made 30 saves in front of a sellout crowd
of 18,519 at Staples Center, helping the Kings to their first victory
in the best-of-seven series.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a lot of things to like in our game tonight," King
Coach Andy Murray said. "We have to do that to certainly beat these
guys."</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche, which scored nine goals in the series' first two
games, was limited to only a first-period goal by Brad Larsen as the
Kings extended their home unbeaten streak to 12 games, with a chance
to add No. 13 in Game 4 tonight.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings are 10-0-2 at Staples Center since March 2.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew this was going to be a tough series," said Avalanche
center Joe Sakic, limited to one shot after scoring three goals in
the first two games. "They came out and played desperate. We'll have
to come back [tonight] and get it back."</TE>
<TE>   Allison said the Kings' defensive effort made the difference.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we played well enough offensively to win the first two
games," he said, "but we made a couple mistakes that cost us. We
could have been up 2-1 [in the series] or 3-0 even if we'd been a
little more solid defensively."</TE>
<TE>   After losing the first two games of the series at Denver, 4-3 and
5-3, the Kings obviously faced an uphill battle in trying to win it.</TE>
<TE>   Dating to 1939, when the NHL introduced the format, teams that
have lost the first two games in best-of-seven playoff series have
rallied to win the series only about 13% of the time. The Kings are
1-8 in that situation, having overcome a 2-0 deficit to eliminate the
Detroit Red Wings last spring.</TE>
<TE>   Murray, though, urged them not to look beyond Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked to our players this morning about taking the approach,
we're playing to win tonight's hockey game," he said before the game.
"We're not playing to win the series tonight. We need to win this
game and move on from there.</TE>
<TE>   "Tonight's game stands on its own. It's one hockey game we need to
win. Let's not be burdened by the fact we've got to win four to win
the series."</TE>
<TE>   Encouraged by their level of commitment and ability to score in
Games 1 and 2, the Kings also were concerned about their defensive
breakdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "The compete's been there," defenseman Mathieu Schneider said
before the game, "but the mistakes we've made, it's like guys are
getting brain cramps once or twice a game, and you can't afford that
in the playoffs, especially against a team like Colorado, with all
the world-class players they have.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to eliminate stupid mistakes. We're doing a lot of right
things, but not enough."</TE>
<TE>   One thing they did right in Game 3 was get the puck to Palffy, who
scored his third goal of the series 19 seconds into the game.</TE>
<TE>   After a faceoff in the Avalanche zone, Allison raced to the puck
in the right corner and poked it to Palffy, who carried it behind the
net and into the left faceoff circle before lifting a shot into the
upper left corner of the net.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, intent on limiting scoring chances after Games 1 and 2,
held Colorado without a shot for nearly the first six minutes.</TE>
<TE>   But from that point until period's end, they were outshot, 11-2.</TE>
<TE>   Larsen, a fourth-line left wing who scored two goals in 50
regular-season games, tied the score with 13:59 to play in the
period, pouncing on a rebound in the slot and lifting it into the net
over Potvin.</TE>
<TE>   In the second period, the Kings needed only 43 seconds to score,
Palffy and Allison again combining forces to make the score 2-1. A
toe save by Avalanche goaltender Patrick Roy on a shot by Palffy
kicked out to Allison at the bottom of the left faceoff circle and
Allison slapped it right back into the net.</TE>
<TE>   At 8:29 of the second period, Allison gathered the puck behind the
net and slipped a pass between the legs of Avalanche defenseman Adam
Foote to Palffy, who slid a shot between Roy's pads to increase the
King lead to 3-1.</TE>

<KH>LAKER NOTES</KH>
<HD>Jackson Still Getting Used to Small Ball</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the hours before his Lakers would open the playoffs against the
Portland Trail Blazers, Coach Phil Jackson snapped that Portland's
small lineup "won't work" because the game would be officiated
differently and the Lakers would manage it differently.</LD>
<LD>   In Game 1, however, the Trail Blazers had some success with it,
just as they had a week before in the double-overtime victory in
Portland, and Jackson granted on Monday that there was still
strategizing to be done there.</LD>
<LD>   Basically, Portland Coach Maurice Cheeks trades Rasheed Wallace's
offense for Shaquille O'Neal's. In it, Wallace often gets open
three-point attempts or help in a screen-and-roll scenario against
O'Neal, and the Trail Blazers have scored reasonably well.</LD>
<TE>   Conversely, the lanky Wallace must guard O'Neal, a massive
mismatch that fatigues Wallace and enlivens O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaq has to do damage to their whole psyche as a basketball team
by getting layups and easy shots," Jackson said. "Or else, put
Wallace in jeopardy of foul trouble. That looks to be what the battle
is going to be about in this series."</TE>
<TE>   In any case, the Lakers would like to get the ball to O'Neal
faster, before the Trail Blazers can organize their double-teams.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers had a short, light practice Monday, primarily spent
lifting weights and watching film. The players who did not play a lot
of minutes Sunday played half-court four-on-four for about an hour,
and everyone walked away, despite some dicey moments.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Horry, who recovered from his stomach muscle injury and
logged 30 hard minutes against Wallace, left early for a dentist
appointment.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, who played 43 minutes Sunday--often while draped by Shawn
Kemp, sometimes by the rest of the Trail Blazers--said his toe felt
fine.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm straight," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There was still some leftover buzz regarding Kobe Bryant's absent
afro. Jackson believed it to be an offensive ploy by Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   "I like his haircut, actually," Jackson said. "I thought it was a
fine move. I thought it confused [Ruben] Patterson. He didn't
recognize Kobe in the first half."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Patterson spent 10 minutes being the "Devean Stopper"
before realizing his error.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers will fly home after Game 3 Sunday night, regardless of
how the series stands.</TE>
<TE>   If Wednesday's Game 4 is necessary, they will return to Portland
on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Brown</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bryant said he expects the Trail Blazers to defend him more
physically in Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   Pippen indicated that would be the case.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we let Kobe get too much penetration," he said.</TE>
<TE>   When asked about helping out on O'Neal, Pippen said: "It wears me
down, really, to have to pound the ball and bring it up and run the
offense and have to guard Kobe and now being asked to give a hand in
on Shaq. It's a lot, but if we're going to win this series, then I've
got to figure out a way to do it."</TE>

<KH>GAME 2 THURSDAY</KH>
<HD>He Can't Stop Himself</HD>
<DH>Lakers: Portland wants Bryant to shoot from outside and he
probably will. Jackson OK with it, as long as team wins.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is a difference between a guy who will shoot a three-pointer
and a three-point shooter, and so Kobe Bryant is torn.</LD>
<LD>   He'd grant that, probably, though he heaved seven three-point
shots Sunday afternoon, when he scored 34 points in that Allen
Iverson kind of way, with lots of shots and lots of contact and just
enough conscience.</LD>
<LD>   There's also a difference between someone who will score ... and a
scorer.</LD>
<TE>   No one really minded, because the Lakers will spend these three
days off having won the first game of a best-of-five series against
the Portland Trail Blazers, who scurried home after the game and
won't return until Wednesday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Jackson allowed that Bryant took a handful of shots he
shouldn't have, including one that got him a couple minutes of down
time with the coaching staff in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Shaquille O'Neal wore a three-Trail Blazer suit for most of
Game 1, and on those occasions Bryant has very strong urges toward
offensive responsibility. So if 28 shots wins it, no one would argue,
and the topic was a light one Monday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   As O'Neal offered during a discussion about reputed "Kobe Stopper"
Ruben Patterson: "He stopped him from getting 35."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal burst into a grin and everybody chuckled and the
conversation moved on to Game 2, Thursday at Staples Center, by which
time the Trail Blazers will have devised a way to defend O'Neal with
rakes and tire irons.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, these are the conversations that would become grim,
after Bryant shot and O'Neal glared and other players stood on the
perimeter waving their arms a lot. Not now. The Trail Blazers prefer
Bryant from 25 feet out to Bryant from one foot over, so they gather
around Shaq and beg the Lakers to shoot over the triple team and hope
they miss. The Lakers made eight of 20 three-pointers, Bryant two of
seven, and the rest of them understand.</TE>
<TE>   "That's something he's going to have to do to keep the defense
honest, is to take a shot," Jackson said. "[He] doesn't have to
search for them. We have other players on the team that are better at
that. He knows that, admits that. But there's nothing wrong with him
using that as an opportunity here and there to keep the defense
honest, if that's what they're going to give him.</TE>
<TE>   "What we don't like is if it becomes a cheap thrill, some easy way
to get points. Because they can run off long rebounds and they can
run off the distraction of guys chasing the ball at the offensive
boards and getting us out of position."</TE>
<TE>   There was little sense that Bryant went on some personal scoring
hunt, because Patterson rarely was a factor on defense, and because
Bryant has had the kind of season that suggests he's over that. He
was open. He's a scorer. Though he missed three-quarters of his
three-point attempts in the regular season, he shot without regret.</TE>
<TE>   It was sort of the plan, after all. One of his recent projects has
been his 24-foot jumper. So, standing five feet open, almost closer
to Chick Hearn than any defender, he shot, without regret, because
that's what all the extra gym time was for.</TE>
<TE>   "Tex Winter has talked to me several times about just taking what
the defense is giving me instead of trying to penetrate and dish it
out all the time, or penetrate and try to get to the hoop myself,"
Bryant said. "Just taking the easy jump shot.</TE>
<TE>   "I never concentrated on it, really. Especially three-point
shooting, I never paid that much attention to it."</TE>
<TE>   He would like to improve, he said, "If teams continue to give me
wide-open looks. It seems like a simple shot to me."</TE>
<TE>   Then again, "It's pretty difficult to try to improve on the fly.
But, I have some experience. This season I went to my left hand after
a couple days of practice, so that's where I get my confidence from,
in believing I can do it."</TE>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers will let him have at it. They have to. They
cannot defend O'Neal at the basket and Bryant at the arc and in the
lane, particularly if Derek Fisher, Rick Fox or Robert Horry is
making outside shots. Fisher made two of three three-pointers Sunday,
and should have taken more. Fox made two of five.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's really just thinking about winning at this point,"
Fisher said. "You can see the emotion he was playing with [Sunday].
He could have gone 0 for 28, it really didn't matter. He was playing
hard, he was playing with energy, playing with effort. He led our
team in a lot of ways, so the main thing is not pressing.</TE>
<TE>   "We're comfortable with what's going on with his game, because
he's sharing the basketball and he's playing within our team concept
99% of the time."</TE>
<TE>   What's left, perhaps, is the tiniest personal challenge, because
every once in a while he can't help himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's stepping up to the challenge of the so-called 'Kobe
Stopper.' That's good," O'Neal said. "I think sometimes they want to
stop me and let everybody else get theirs or let me get mine and stop
everybody else. So, as long as we play good team basketball, none of
those strategies will work. We've seen it before. This is nothing new
to us. This is our type of basketball."</TE>

<LD>Toronto Raptor forward Jerome Williams called the booing of the
Canadian national anthem by Detroit Piston fans "sad."</LD>
<LD>   Before Sunday's Game 1 of the first-round playoff series, the
capacity crowd at the Palace of Auburn Hills booed "O Canada" from
beginning to end.</LD>
<LD>   "That was something I wouldn't have expected from a city like
Detroit. It was disheartening," Williams, a former Piston, said after
Monday's practice. "It was a total lack of respect."</LD>
<TE>   The display came on the day funerals began for the four Canadian
soldiers killed when an American F-16 mistakenly bombed Canadian
troops in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "In dealing with what everybody's been through, it's hard to
understand why they would do something like that," Toronto's Antonio
Davis said. "It was stupidity on their part, so we'll let them deal
with it."</TE>
<TE>   Some Raptors said the team was the intended target of the wrath.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they were more booing the Raptors than they were booing
Canada," Raptor Coach Lenny Wilkens said. "The mob is easily led."</TE>

<HD>Nets' Big Win Is Kidd's Play</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>The New Jersey Nets shook off the playoff jitters with a few things
even more valuable in the postseason than a half-court offense: Jason
Kidd, a great defense and a big dose of self-assurance.</LD>
<LD>   Kidd had 20 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists, Kenyon Martin
shut down Jermaine O'Neal and Indiana's inside game and the Nets beat
the Pacers, 95-79, Monday night to even their best-of-five
first-round series at 1-1.</LD>
<LD>   "Jason had that slight edge tonight and I think everyone on our
team knew this was a must-win," Net Coach Byron Scott said.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know if guys wanted to admit it, but we knew we had to
win this game and Jason came out with a different attitude. He was
pressing at both ends of the court. Kenyon started it off and
everyone pretty much followed."</TE>
<TE>   Heading into Game 2, the pressure was on the Nets after losing the
home-court advantage with an 89-83 loss Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Nets had a lot of heroes in addition to Kidd. Playing
with a sore right wrist, Martin was a big one.</TE>
<TE>   Scott walked up to him early in the day and asked him if he wanted
to guard O'Neal, who scored 30 points Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Martin gladly accepted.</TE>
<TE>   "I just didn't let him catch the ball in his sweet spot, in the
right blocks," Martin said. "If he got it, I contested every shot.
The shots he was making in the first game, he wasn't making tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Martin also added 19 points, and Keith Van Horn, who had 10 points
in Game 1, scored 17. Backup center Aaron Williams added 15,
including six in a game-breaking run early in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   It was New Jersey's first playoff victory since beating the Knicks
in overtime on May 4, 1994.</TE>

<HD>Disparity Between Forecast and Fact</HD>

<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid all the harping on competitive and revenue disparity,
Commissioner Bud Selig would call it an aberration. Put it this way:</LD>
<LD>   If the Montreal Expos, Minnesota Twins and Pittsburgh Pirates lead
their divisions, as they do, it's a clear indication of the danger in
early judging of 2002's races and teams.</LD>
<LD>   The next three weeks may provide greater clarity--or greater
confusion.</LD>
<TE>   In the cases of the Angels and Dodgers, however, there has been
enough evidence in the first three weeks to suggest that the alleged
experts--here I go, writing about myself again--misread their Tarot
cards.</TE>
<TE>   I'm reserving the right to change opinion again later, but it
seems that the Angels were overrated, and the Dodgers were possibly
underrated.</TE>
<TE>   If that revised Dodger evaluation is cautious and not so certain,
it's because all of the pivotal spring questions have produced only a
mixed bag of answers.</TE>
<TE>   For example:</TE>
<TE>   * If Kazuhisa Ishii and Odalis Perez are removing March qualms,
the physical status of Kevin Brown remains a significant concern, and
Andy Ashby has been inconsistent in his comeback from similar elbow
surgery.</TE>
<TE>   * If Eric Gagne has emerged as the closer, Paul Quantrill and
Terry Mulholland have been disappointing in the set-up and
middle-relief assignments.</TE>
<TE>   * If shortstop Cesar Izturis has been solid in the field and the
No. 2 spot in the batting order, Dave Roberts has struggled batting
leadoff, making creativity difficult.</TE>
<TE>   * If Eric Karros has been encouraging in his comeback from 2001's
setback, an offense lacking the type of hitter who disrupts pitching
schemes ranks 13th among the 16 National League teams in runs.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks, of course, amount to a heartbeat in a six-month
season and the uncertainty clearly lingers in key areas.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, with apologies to Randy Johnson, Curt Schilling and the
World Series champion Arizona Diamondbacks, the NL West has no
116-win standout of the Seattle Mariners' caliber and the Dodgers
seem more capable of contending now than they did April 1.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, Ishii, Perez and Gagne, in particular, were major
concerns and/or unknowns, the depth of the rotation was in question,
the void at closer was a gaping wound.</TE>
<TE>   All of that has become a fading memory.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii and Perez, joined by Hideo Nomo and Omar Daal, have
stabilized the rotation, and Gagne has been flawless.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the Dodgers could survive if Brown were to be sidelined
for an extended period, or if the offense failed to improve, is
questionable.</TE>
<TE>   In another era, the Dodgers made their mark in Los Angeles with
pitching and not much else.</TE>
<TE>   It's a stretch to compare this to that era of Koufax and Drysdale,
but it can legitimately be said that the rotation is giving the
Dodgers a chance to win every game, helping ease the burden on an
offense relying heavily--and unrealistically, perhaps--on Shawn Green
and Paul Lo Duca to duplicate their 2001 productivity (without Gary
Sheffield somewhere in the middle) and contributing to a more relaxed
clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   How far the Dodgers go remains to be seen, but they are likely to
make the trip with more unity and camaraderie.</TE>
<TE>   They have replaced Sheffield, a ticking time bomb, with a genuine
leader in Brian Jordan and continue to get improved communication and
direction from Manager Jim Tracy, a key himself.</TE>
<TE>   In a heated race over a prolonged period, Tracy's tactics and
strategies will be more closely scrutinized than during last year's
honeymoon season.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, his decision Sunday to give virtually his entire bench
some at-bats by resting four regulars, in the comparative cool of
April with a day off following, left a struggling offense with even
fewer weapons in a 5-0 loss to San Diego. That might have--and maybe
should have--drawn criticism from a more hardened media in a more
hardened environment.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Scioscia, Tracy's Angel counterpart, also continues to fly
under the media radar, despite another disappointing start.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, who finished 41 games behind the Mariners last year,
are 91/2 games back after Monday's loss in the first of a three-game
series at Seattle, a pivotal series in April.</TE>
<TE>   The acquisitions of pitchers Aaron Sele and Kevin Appier and
designated hitter Brad Fullmer raised expectations, clouding reality
and certain imperatives.</TE>
<TE>   At this point:</TE>
<TE>   * Tim Salmon and Darin Erstad, recently sidelined with a
concussion, have yet to regain their 2000 form, although Salmon
awakened some over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   * Neither Fullmer nor first baseman Scott Spiezio has provided the
productivity expected at offensive positions.</TE>
<TE>   * Third baseman Troy Glaus continues having problems with plate
discipline. He is striking out at nearly the pace of the last two
years (163 in 2000 and 158 last season) and complaining about his
contact lenses, of which no one said anything when he was hitting 41
homers last year and 47 in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   * Young starters Jarrod Washburn, Ramon Ortiz and Scott
Schoeneweis continue to have difficulty pitching two games alike, and
Sele has more resembled the bombed pitcher of last October than the
15-game winner of the previous months.</TE>
<TE>   * The conspicuous absence of versatile Shigetoshi Hasegawa, now
pitching for Seattle, has hurt the bullpen, as did Troy Percival's
season-opening stint on the disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   The closer returned Saturday at Oakland, after not having pitched
since late March, and was hit hard in his first two appearances. So
why wasn't he sent on a minor league rehabilitation assignment to
sharpen his control, rather than simply working simulated games in
Anaheim?</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line is that the Angels faced the Mariners with a team
earned-run average that was ninth in the AL and an offense that was
last in runs and tied for last in home runs, only seven in 18 games.</TE>
<TE>   Those are numbing numbers. However, the Anaheim team was batting
higher than those aforementioned experts who appear to have
underrated the Dodgers, overrated the Angels and can't wait for
another three weeks to change their minds again.</TE>

<LD>Maryland sophomore forward Chris Wilcox, who helped the Terrapins win
the NCAA men's basketball title this season, will skip his final two
college seasons to make himself available for the NBA draft on June
26.</LD>
<LD>   The 6-foot-10, 220-pound Wilcox emerged as one of the nation's top
power forwards, averaging 12 points and 7.1 rebounds for Maryland.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cornerbacks Markese Fitzgerald of Miami and Bennie Alexander of

49ers. Simonton was Oregon State's all-time leading rusher and

<TE>   Figure Skating</TE>
<TE>   The French judge at the center of the Salt Lake City figure
skating scandal promised to support the Russian pair three months
before the Olympics, the Washington Post reported. In a letter to the
International Skating Union, Swiss judge Christine Blanc said
Marie-Reine Le Gougne vowed she would favor the Russians for the gold
medal. Blanc joined three other judges who have accused Le Gougne or
French federation president Didier Gailhaguet of improper conduct.</TE>
<TE>   "When I saw Marie-Reine say she was a victim, that she had
pressure, I thought, 'Now, it's enough,'" Blanc said.</TE>
<TE>   Blanc and Canadian judge Benoit Lavoie did not immediately report
Le Gougne's comments at Skate Canada in November because they
believed "it will make a big mess, and nobody will believe us," Blanc
said. French judge Alain Miquel said he followed orders from
Gailhaguet to vote for certain competitors at two major events.</TE>
<TE>   Le Gougne and Gailhaguet will face an ISU council hearing on
Monday. Le Gougne's lawyer, Maxwell A. Miller, said in his own letter
to the ISU "there is no credible, consistent and uncoerced evidence
of any misconduct."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A rough start turned into an easy finish for Evgeni Nabokov and the
San Jose Sharks.</LD>
<LD>   Nabokov gave up a goal to Shane Doan on Phoenix's first shot, then
made 35 saves as the Sharks beat the Coyotes, 4-1, Monday night at
Phoenix to take a 2-1 lead in their best-of-seven first-round Western
Conference playoff series.</LD>
<LD>   Mike Ricci had a goal and an assist, and Patrick Marleau, Adam
Graves and Scott Thornton also scored for the Sharks, who scored only
three goals in the first two games after finishing fourth in the NHL
in goals during the regular season.</LD>
<TE>   Game 4 is Wednesday night at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   The Sharks knew what they had to do to regain the home-ice
advantage--crash the net, create havoc to distract goalie Sean Burke
and cash in--and they did.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Division champions turned it up early in the second
period after allowing the Coyotes to enjoy a 1-0 lead most of the
first.</TE>
<TE>   Marleau scored his second goal by taking advantage of a screen by
Marco Sturm, who tangled with Daymond Langkow in front of Burke.
Graves squeezed a shot between Burke's arm and body from close in,
and Thornton poked in a rebound to make it 3-1 at 7:20 of the third.</TE>
<TE>   Nabokov, who had seven shutouts during the season, was strong
after allowing Doan's score 1:06 in.</TE>
<TE>   He had four saves during a Coyote power play that began with 5:03
left in the second period, including a rejection of a shot by Langkow
while falling and a kick save on Langkow's rebound attempt.</TE>
<TE>   Burke got an assist on Doan's goal, clearing the puck to Todd
Simpson, who passed to Doan in the Phoenix end. The power forward
stepped past a defender at the blue line, raced down the right wing
and fired from the circle, beating Nabokov on the far side.</TE>
<TE>   But Marleau, who scored the winner in Game 1, tied it 3:40 into
the second period. The Sharks got the lead at 5:38 when Graves
whiffed on his first try at a shot, then got just enough on the puck
to squirt it in off Burke's jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Ricci scored 23 seconds after Thornton, and the period degenerated
into a series of penalties by the frustrated Coyotes. The Sharks had
three of their eight power plays in the final 4:22.</TE>
<TE>   Burke made 15 of his 30 saves in the third period.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 3, Philadelphia 0--Radek Bonk got his first playoff goal,
scoring on a power play 2:04 into the third period and Patrick Lalime
got his second consecutive shutout as the Senators won at Ottawa. The
Senators, who have given up no goals in regulation in this Eastern
Conference series, hold a 2-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "They're playing as well as they have since they came into this
league," Flyer center Jeremy Roenick said. "It's a credit to their
coaches. We have to try to take a page out of their book."</TE>
<TE>   Bonk, who assisted on Ottawa's first goal Saturday for his second
point in 26 playoff games, fired a shot from the slot past goalie
Roman Cechmanek and just inside the right post.</TE>
<TE>   Marian Hossa scored into an empty net with 54.3 seconds remaining
before a wild white towel-waving Corel Centre crowd of 18,239.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Alfredsson scored another empty-net goal 44 seconds later.</TE>
<TE>   Lalime made 26 saves in his second career playoff win and shutout.
He stopped 33 shots in a 3-0 win in Game 2 as the teams split the
first two games.</TE>

<KH>Lonnie White ON THE NHL</KH>
<HD>It's Foolish to Count Out the Red Wings Just Yet</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The hockey world was in shock when eighth-seeded Vancouver took a 2-0
lead over Detroit in their best-of-seven Western Conference
quarterfinal series.</LD>
<LD>   Watching the Canucks win consecutive games at Joe Louis Arena was
especially tough on Red Wing fans, who booed or jeered Scotty
Bowman's team throughout the last period of Detroit's 5-2 Game 2 loss
last week.</LD>
<LD>   Detroit's fans shouldn't be so fickle.</LD>
<TE>   The Red Wings won this season's President's Trophy because they
were the league's best team. They didn't finish with 116 points by
accident.</TE>
<TE>   Counting Bowman and the Red Wings out after two games was a big
mistake. Detroit has too many future hall of famers and too much
experience.</TE>
<TE>   That's why it shouldn't be a surprise to see the Red Wings looking
to regain home-ice advantage tonight in Game 4 after an impressive
3-1 victory at Vancouver on Sunday in Game 3. If the Carolina
Hurricanes opened a series with two losses at home, they would be
finished.</TE>
<TE>   But not the Red Wings, who needed only to get back to basics.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit floundered down the stretch, going winless over its last
seven regular-season games, which, coincidentally or not, happened
after Bowman began resting his regulars.</TE>
<TE>   One of Bowman's motives was to experiment with different player
combinations because of the Red Wings' abundance of talent.</TE>
<TE>   Bowman gave defenseman Niklas Lidstrom a break to work in Uwe
Krupp, who missed most of the season because of injury. He also
allowed veterans Igor Larionov and Luc Robitaille time off.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't such a great idea because, by the time the Red Wings
rolled into the playoffs, they were in a funk.</TE>
<TE>   Bowman found out that it's not always easy for a team to turn it
on whenever it wants to.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings' chemistry was out of whack, and Vancouver, the
NHL's highest scoring team in the regular season, scored a combined
nine goals in Games 1 and 2.</TE>
<TE>   The target for most of the fans' taunts was goaltender Dominik
Hasek, who looked bad on a couple of Vancouver goals. It wasn't
necessarily Hasek's fault though.</TE>
<TE>   It's widely known that Hasek doesn't like to have players blocking
his view, especially his own teammates. But when Bowman shook up his
lineup and then added captain Steve Yzerman and Krupp to the mix, the
Red Wings lost their rhythm.</TE>
<TE>   Before Sunday's Game 3, Bowman decided to revert to the lineup he
used for much of the season, splitting up defensemen Chris Chelios
and Lidstrom, and putting the Red Wings' three best offensive players
on one line.</TE>
<TE>   Bowman put defenseman Frederik Olausson into the lineup for Krupp
and teamed him with Lidstrom, his partner earlier this season.
Defenseman Jiri Fischer then was reunited with Chelios.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings then teamed forwards Sergei Fedorov, Brendan
Shanahan and Yzerman, who formed a super No. 1 line. Bowman also had
Kris Draper and Larionov switch positions, with Draper going back on
Detroit's roughneck line with Kirk Maltby and Darren McCarty.
Larionov then centered a No. 2 line with Robitaille and Tomas
Holmstrom.</TE>
<TE>   The moves produced an outstanding first period against the Canucks
as the Red Wings had good scoring chances and reduced their
giveaways.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit also did a better job slowing Vancouver's big line, which
features Todd Bertuzzi and Markus Naslund.</TE>
<TE>   With less traffic in front, Hasek looked like his acrobatic self,
frustrating the Canucks with 22 saves, including 11 in the third
period.</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver Coach Marc Crawford matched his top line against
Detroit's No. 1 trio most of the night and did not have much success.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, it's Crawford's turn to adjust.</TE>
<TE>   Line Shifts</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey's rookie Brian Gionta is generously listed at 5 feet 7,
but he has played big for the Devils so far in their series with
Carolina. Gionta, the goat in Game 2 when his clearing pass was
intercepted by Carolina's Marek Malik and turned into a Bates
Battaglia overtime winner, made a huge difference in the Devils' 4-0
Game 3 victory on Sunday. Gionta, a three-time Hobey Baker Award
finalist at Boston College, scored a goal, had one disallowed because
it was played with a high stick, and fought off the 6-5 Malik to
block Carolina goalie Arturs Irbe's view on a Bobby Holik goal....
New Jersey winger Scott Gomez has begun to do some light skating but
the cast won't come off his broken left hand until at least May 4.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Brian Sutter is as tough as they come, but he even
empathized with Chicago fans after his Blackhawks were crushed at
home, 4-0, by St. Louis in Game 3 of a Western Conference
quarterfinal series. After putting up one of the league's best home
records during the regular season, the Blackhawks didn't show much
life on Sunday. "It was one of the worst hockey games anybody could
watch," Sutter said. "The fans were incredible at the beginning. They
were great, and [their support] was wasted." Look for the Blackhawks
to be a tad more physical in tonight's Game 4. It also would help if
Chicago's Tony Amonte starts playing like he's worth $8 million a
season.</TE>
<TE>   Like Amonte, Toronto goalie Curtis Joseph is a potential free
agent, but he's playing like he's worth a monster multi-year
contract. Joseph is making his point with outstanding play for the
Maple Leafs, who look to take a 3-0 lead against the New York
Islanders.... Former King first-round pick Aki Berg has stepped up as
a big-time defenseman for Toronto Coach Pat Quinn. Berg has been
teamed with fellow Finnish player Jykre Lumme and the pair has played
exclusively against the Islanders' top line, which features Alexei
Yashin.</TE>
<TE>   Calgary, which missed the playoffs for the sixth consecutive
season, is claiming losses that will total $6.5 million (Canadian)
this year. Vancouver, which originally estimated losses this season
to be around $5 million, is now expecting to lose $3 million because
the Canucks made the playoffs.</TE>

<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Preston Wilson and Derrek Lee each hit two-run homers in the fifth
inning and Cliff Floyd later had a three-run shot as the Florida
Marlins avoided a sweep, beating the Atlanta Braves, 8-3, Monday
night at Atlanta.</LD>
<LD>   Florida snapped Atlanta's season-high four-game winning streak and
also denied the Braves their first four-game series sweep in almost
five years.</LD>
<LD>   Brad Penny (2-1) pitched six-plus innings for the win, giving up
eight hits and two earned runs.</LD>
<TE>   Wilson and Lee homered against Kevin Millwood (2-2). Floyd, who
missed the previous two games with tonsillitis, hit a 427-foot shot
off Kerry Ligtenberg with two out in the ninth, giving him four
homers in his last four games and seven this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves squandered numerous chances. Julio Franco twice hit
into inning-ending double plays with the bases loaded. In the sixth,
the first two batters singled, but Javy Lopez hit into a double play
and Wes Helms popped out.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Sheffield sat out because of a sore left wrist. He has missed
four of the last six games.</TE>
<TE>   The game drew only 21,461--the smallest crowd in Turner Field's
six-year history.</TE>

<TE>   You want to change the station inside the arena but can't. It's an

<TE>   Enter building.</TE>
<TE>   Hear national anthem. Watch the Trail Blazers get contentious in
the first half.</TE>

the Trail Blazers making serious runs in the second half. Notice the
Lakers assuming it's time to do business again and responding.</TE>

anything but cement the victory.</TE>
<TE>   Never feel the pulse rate quicken with any suspicion the Lakers
might not cement the victory.</TE>
<TE>   Ignore the scoreboard even when the teams' scores appear close,
realizing the irrelevance to the Lakers cementing the victory.</TE>
<TE>   Witness the Lakers cement the victory.</TE>
<TE>   Feel the arid deja vu.</TE>
<TE>   Hear Portland's good coach and nice man--even when it changes good
coaches and nice men--say something along the lines of, "I'm pretty
satisfied with the way we played, but a little bit dissatisfied."</TE>
<TE>   Watch Laker Coach Phil Jackson enter and take a seat. Draw nearer
as if Donald Rumsfeld fixes to speak.</TE>
<TE>   Hear him say something along the lines of, "A fine game to open
the series with."</TE>
<TE>   Mill around. Hear the same questions. Hear roughly the same

<TE>   Which year is this? Really? Thanks.</TE>
<TE>   Any chance of coming here Thursday and playing, say, the Clippers?
No?</TE>
<TE>   Here's the thing about Trail Blazers-Lakers circa 2002.</TE>
<TE>   We know the Lakers are 100% certain the Lakers will cement the
victory, and the Blazers are about 10% certain the Lakers will cement
the victory.</TE>
<TE>   We've seen the game so much by now, it can't pull anything over on
us.</TE>

<HD>Transfer Rule Could Undergo Strict Changes</HD>
<DH>High schools: Southern Section expected to adopt proposal
to curb varsity eligibility of those who do not move.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Southern Section is expected to adopt a proposal that will
prohibit students who transfer schools without moving from
participating in varsity sports for one year.</LD>
<LD>   The legislation is up for a vote before the section council
Thursday, during a meeting of 83 league representatives and athletic
officials in Long Beach. If approved, it will go into effect in the
2003-2004 school year.</LD>
<LD>   Students who transfer would still be eligible to compete at levels
below varsity and in sports they haven't previously played in high
school.</LD>
<TE>   Similar rules already are in effect in the Marmonte, Mission and
Pacific View leagues. The Pacific View rule is the most strict,
barring transfers from competing in sports at any level.</TE>
<TE>   "We might finally reach closure on this transfer thing," said West
Hills Chaminade Principal Gary Murphy, who represents the Mission
League and is a proponent of the initiative. "Even if it doesn't
pass, it's elevated dialogue, but judging from the reaction I've
gotten from principals, people are ready for a change."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 3,800 students transferred in the 529-school section from
the fall of 1999 through December of last year, a figure that does
not include students who transferred because of a change in
residence.</TE>
<TE>   The section initiative would complement a proposal being
considered by the California Interscholastic Federation, which
governs competition for the state's 1,292 high schools.</TE>
<TE>   At meetings May 3-4, the CIF will vote on a rule requiring school
officials to certify that no one connected with their booster clubs
or athletic programs had contact with transfers. If approved, it will
go into effect for the 2002-2003 school year on a two-year trial
basis.</TE>
<TE>   After the transfer window is slammed shut, some administrators are
saying that material advantages that entice athletes to change
schools should be the next topic tackled.</TE>
<TE>   Recent newspaper accounts of the partnerships between shoe
companies and some high school basketball teams have scholastic
lawmakers considering additional legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Nike and Adidas sponsor about 200 high school basketball teams,
including 15 in the Southland. Most receive two pairs of basketball
shoes, an athletic bag and a T-shirt for each player, but selected
teams like Westchester and Santa Ana Mater Dei last season were fully
outfitted by Nike for free. For example, each Westchester player
received more than $1,300 in gear, including five pairs of shoes, and
the team had its trip to a prestigious tournament paid for by a Nike
affiliate.</TE>
<TE>   "As a principal, it abhors me to think there is an outside agency
that could have control over financing something on my campus," said
Norwalk Principal Frank Zepeda, who represents the Suburban League on
the section council. "We would join anybody making a move to oust
something like that."</TE>
<TE>   Section Commissioner James Staunton said he was bothered by the
"selectivity" of schools targeted by shoe companies because of their
gaudy records. He is in favor of curbing the power of sneaker giants.</TE>
<TE>   "The way I would see it going would be possibly to limit these
services," Staunton said. "If Nike pays for kids to go to a
tournament, there would be some reasonable limit that they couldn't
send them to the Ritz-Carlton or feed them on $150 a day [per
person]."</TE>
<TE>   Such donations are legal, although a state bylaw stipulates that
teams are supposed to report single-source donations of more than
$500 to a school administrative source, most often the principal or
an athletic director.</TE>
<TE>   "The school that receives all these things, kids will want to go
there," Covina Principal Karl Major said. "Corporate sponsorship is
sneaking into individual high schools and it's ridiculous. I guess I
just don't understand high school sports anymore. They're losing
their real value."</TE>
<TE>   Peter J. Saco, commissioner of the Sac-Joaquin Section, the second
largest CIF section, said that sneaker-sponsored teams "maybe
shouldn't be in our playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   "They shouldn't be competing against schools in suburban L.A. or
Ontario that are just trying to make ends meet," Saco said. "It's a
little extreme, but maybe these people have created such an unlevel
playing field that they play in the regular season and in these
[elite] tournaments and then that's it.</TE>
<TE>   "How can [shoe-company sponsorship] possibly be a good thing for
high school sports when only certain schools are benefiting from it?
The rich get richer and everybody else tries to survive. It leads to
school shopping and recruiting. The better seventh- and
eighth-graders are going to funnel to these schools. That's not the
philosophy we want."</TE>
<TE>   Some administrators favor limiting sponsors rather than outlawing
them. Or encouraging deep-pocket sponsors to more broadly share the
wealth.</TE>
<TE>   "All kids, regardless of where they're at, should be treated
equally," said Jeff Schwartz, a former basketball coach who is in his
fifth year as principal at Montebello. "One solution is that they're
just not able to do it. The other option is that they can make a
donation to each school's athletic program, with the condition that
they get to sponsor some schools a little bit more."</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente Principal Chuck Hinman said he has trouble
differentiating between big athletic-apparel sponsorships and those
from smaller businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you going to tell Sonny's Pizza they can't [sponsor a high
school team]? That you can't take a $5,000 check they are giving you
that is going directly to uniforms?" Hinman said.</TE>
<TE>   "The district is going to provide a Volkswagen. But if you're
going to drive a Cadillac, you need funding from alternative sources.
We're going to give you jerseys, five or six basketballs and a place
to play. If you want more, then the coach has to go out and find that
sponsor."</TE>
<TE>   Mater Dei Principal Patrick Murphy said the agreement between Nike
and his school should be congratulated, not criticized.</TE>
<TE>   "As a school that does not get government aid, it's incumbent upon
us to find corporate sponsorships in many different ways," said
Murphy, who represents the Serra League on the Southern Section
council. "If you work hard to develop sponsorships and corporate
relationships, you should be rewarded for that."</TE>

<DH>Robinson Latest Female Driver Seeking Sponsor</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It has been 25 years since Janet Guthrie knocked down big-time motor
racing's gender barrier by driving in the Indianapolis 500 and
Daytona 500.</LD>
<LD>   In those 25 years, no other woman drove in the Daytona 500, stock
car racing's premier Winston Cup race, until Shawna Robinson
qualified last February.</LD>
<LD>   It's not that there were no female drivers good enough. Mostly, it
was lack of sponsorship funds to finance the effort.</LD>
<TE>   Is it more difficult for a woman to find sponsor money than for a
male driver? In discussing the case of Indy Racing League favorite
Sarah Fisher, who began the season on the sidelines for lack of
sponsorship money--and finished fourth as a substitute driver in
Sunday's IRL race--one high-ranking race official, who asked not to
be identified, said:</TE>
<TE>   "Let's face it, no corporate sponsor wants to take the risk of
having his name on a car in which a woman is killed, or injured
critically. That's no knock on women drivers.... Something like that
could happen to anyone. What if a woman had been in that car instead
of Dale Earnhardt last year [when he was killed in the Daytona 500]?"</TE>
<TE>   Guthrie has written a book about her experiences at the top levels
of motor sports, the Indianapolis 500 and the Daytona 500. She has
been unable to find a publisher for her manuscript, the writer's
equivalent of not finding a sponsor for her car.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson is running only 24 Winston Cup races this season--instead
of all 36--because she has no major sponsor. She is entered in this
week's NAPA Auto Parts 500 at California Speedway in a year-old Dodge
Intrepid that is privately underwritten by Beth Ann and Tony
Morgenthau.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the same old sponsorship issue," said Guthrie from her home
in Aspen, Colo., where she moved in 1985 to finish her book. "There
is no doubt in my mind that I could have won a Winston Cup race, but
without sponsors, no chance. That is why I finally gave it up, not
because I'd lost my ability."</TE>
<TE>   Robinson, 37, who restarted her career in 1999 after a brief
retirement to start a family, is facing the same problem. She has a
proven record--a pole in an Atlanta Busch series race, a second in an
ARCA race at Daytona and three victories in what is now the Goody's
Dash series.</TE>
<TE>   Said Dale Earnhardt Jr. after being involved in an accident with
Robinson at Texas Motor Speedway three weeks ago: "I think Shawna got
into me a little bit. She's a good race car driver. They need to get
her in a better race car."</TE>
<TE>   Said Robinson: "It's remarkable we've done as much as we have in
such a short time. We started from scratch with only four guys in the
shop five weeks before Daytona. We didn't even have a car. Now [chief
mechanic] Eddie Jones has a full crew of 22 with eight cars ready to
go."</TE>
<TE>   The 5-foot 7, 110-pound Robinson, a native of Des Moines, Iowa,
qualified the No. 49 BAM Racing Dodge and completed 187 of 200 laps,
finishing 24th, at Daytona.</TE>
<TE>   BAM is the monogram of co-owner Beth Ann Morgenthau, whose husband
is an investment banker in Coral Gables, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   "Shawna works hard, and I think her effort can make a difference,"
said Jones, who formerly worked with Dale Earnhardt, Darrell Waltrip
and Morgan Shepard. "Our main objective is to make the car
comfortable so that she can go out and run at a race pace."</TE>
<TE>   The team had a setback last week when she failed to qualify for
Sunday's race at Talladega, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough when your team doesn't have any provisionals [starting
positions based on car-owner standings] and you've got to [qualify]
in two laps," she said. "I just hope I have better luck at Fontana
than I had last year."</TE>
<TE>   Driving then for Michael Kranefuss, her Ford Taurus broke a gear
in a qualifying warmup lap and did not make the race.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't compare the cars," she said. "The one I'm driving now
is much better. It compares favorably with the other Dodges. When we
were out here testing, our speeds were not far off [Sterling]
Marlin's."</TE>
<TE>   Marlin, who drives for the Dodge factory, is the Winston Cup
points leader.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson is a bit bitter, however, at the lack of support from
Dodge, which had announced last year that all the Dodge teams would
work together as one big happy family.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't had a bit of help from the factory," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "But the Morgenthaus have given me more seat time in testing than
I have ever had. I think I've had almost as much as a full-time
driver. They've invested $8 million in a partial season, and they'd
like to at least break even, but without a sponsor it is difficult.
Finding a sponsor is the toughest part of racing, tougher than
driving."</TE>
<TE>   About as tough as Guthrie's finding a publisher for a book.</TE>
<TE>   "Knowing what I went through, I'm not surprised that there have
been so few women at the top level," Guthrie said. "I thought it
might take even longer. I've been pleased to read a couple of
magazine articles on a number of women in the lower ranks. That's
encouraging."</TE>
<TE>   Guthrie drove her last race in 1980, at 42, having competed in
three Indianapolis 500s for car owner Rolla Vollstedt, and in 33
Winston Cup races between 1976 and 1980.</TE>
<TE>   "I moved to Aspen with the idea of completing my book in nine
months," she said. "It ended up taking 18 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to make every woman who read it think that she could do
her own version of what I did. I had two objectives. First, I wanted
to convey the passion and complexity of the sport to a wider audience
than its existing fans. I tried to put the reader inside my skin,
make the reader feel that she or he is lapping the track at close to
200 mph.</TE>
<TE>   "Second, I wanted to record the tenor of changing times back then,
all those cries of, 'Women in race cars are going to endanger our
lives,' stuff like that. I think today's women will find a lot of
humor in it."</TE>
<TE>   When Guthrie first qualified at Indy, it was only five years after
women were allowed in the garage area. At the time, there were no
restrooms for women in Gasoline Alley.</TE>
<TE>   "Young women need to know that they're not coming out of nowhere,
that they have a history to build on with their own accomplishments,"
Guthrie said. "Women have always done extraordinary things. Think of
[explorer-adventurers] Gertrude Bell in Arabia and Mary Kingsley in
Africa, a hundred years ago. Think of the women hot-air balloonists
of the 1770s. Too often, women's history has been lost."</TE>

<LD>Injuries have removed some of the luster, but none of the
significance, from today's European Champions League semifinal game
between Barcelona and Real Madrid.</LD>
<LD>   Besides a worldwide TV audience, World Cup coaches from several
countries will be watching nervously, crossing their fingers in hopes
that their players will come through unscathed.</LD>
<LD>   Real Madrid's Zinedine Zidane, the world's most expensive player,
has a strained thigh muscle and is doubtful for the opener of the
two-game series at Barcelona's Nou Camp Stadium. The teams will play
again at Madrid's Santiago Bernabeu Stadium on May 1.</LD>
<TE>   The loss of Zidane, whose two goals against Brazil in the final
propelled France to its 1998 World Cup triumph, could be costly to
Real Madrid, which already is without Spain's national team striker
Fernando Morientes, who also has an injured thigh, and Portugal
midfielder Luis Figo, who not only is suspended but also has an ankle
injury.</TE>
<TE>   Even without that trio, Real Madrid still has Brazil's Roberto
Carlos and Spain's Fernando Hierro and Raul to help it carry the day.</TE>
<TE>   Barcelona, meanwhile, is without Brazil forward Rivaldo, who tore
a knee ligament during a league game Saturday. Barcelona also is
without Spain's national team defender Carles Puyol, who suffered a
thigh injury Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Real Madrid has won the European Cup eight times, most recently in
2000, but wants to cap its centennial year by winning the final in
Glasgow, Scotland, next month. Barcelona has won the title once, in
1992.</TE>
<TE>   The Real Madrid-Barcelona winner will play the winner of the other
two-game semifinal series beginning Wednesday between England's
Manchester United and Germany's Bayer Leverkusen.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Italian league coaches annually award something called "the golden
bench" to the coach they pick as the best of the season. On Monday,
Fabio Capello won it for the third time, after leading AS Roma to its
first Serie A title in 18 years. Capello also won in 1992 and 1994
while coaching AC Milan.</TE>
<TE>   Latin America</TE>
<TE>   Uruguay's national team striker Sebastian Abreu set a Mexican
league record by scoring his 17th and 18th goals of the season for
Cruz Azul in a 2-2 tie with Toluca, surpassing the single-season
total set by Mexico striker Jared Borgetti.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Colombian national team striker Faustino Asprilla returned
to the Colombian league after a decade in exile, only to be
red-carded in his first game back.</TE>
<TE>   Asprilla, whose career took him from Atletico Nacional in Colombia
to Newcastle United in England, Parma in Italy, Palmeiras and
Fluminense in Brazil, and Atlante in Mexico, returned to his original
club and was ejected late in the game for calling the referee a
clown.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, he claimed that, "one single defender kicked me more
than 40 times."</TE>
<TE>   Asia</TE>
<TE>   Japan's Coach Philippe Troussier said Monday that he would name
his 23-man World Cup roster May 17, shortly after warmup games
against Real Madrid and Norway. Japan plays at Real Madrid on May 7
as part of the Spanish club's centennial celebrations and plays
Norway in Oslo on May 14.</TE>
<TE>   Troussier named 25 players to a squad that will play Slovakia next
Monday in Tokyo and Honduras on May 2 in Kobe in the annual Kirin
Cup.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   World Cup co-host South Korea announced Monday they that it will
play Scotland in a warmup game May 16 in the port city of Busan.
Coach Guus Hiddink's team also has warmup games scheduled against
China on April 27, England on May 21 and France on May 26.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   South Korea and Japan will establish special telephone hotlines to
help coordinate security and keep each other informed about possible
terrorism or infectious disease threats during the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   The countries' defense ministers agreed on the plan during a
meeting in Seoul over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Africa</TE>
<TE>   Senegal, which will open the World Cup against defending champion
France on May 31 in Seoul, will play Kashiwa Reysol of Japan's
J-League in a warmup game May 19 in Fujieda, a city just south of
Tokyo that will serve as the African team's World Cup base.</TE>

<LD>Adam Simon thrives on pressure. He's the teenager who rides the
fastest roller coaster and instead of feeling terrified, steps out of
the car and says, "Cool!"</LD>
<LD>   When the bases are loaded and the count is 3 and 2, it's Simon
time. He never shows any sign of panic. His heart isn't pounding, his
hands aren't sweating, his breathing doesn't become rapid, shallow or
erratic.</LD>
<LD>   "When those times come up, that's when I start having the most
fun, especially when you get the big out," he said. "You feel so
complete."</LD>
<TE>   Simon, a senior right-hander at La Puente Bishop Amat High, is the
most complete baseball player in Southern California. He has a
three-year pitching record of 22-1. This season, he's 8-0 with a 1.58
earned-run average. He also leads the Lancers in batting with a .559
average.</TE>
<TE>   "If you take the best pitchers in high school and line them up
from here to the other coast, I'll take Adam," Coach Kenny Kendrena
said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon is 5 feet 11 and 170 pounds, throws a fastball more than 90
mph and has an unbreakable competitive spirit.</TE>
<TE>   "His mind is made up when he gets on the mound that it's going to
be his day," Kendrena said.</TE>
<TE>   If only Simon could convince his mother, Susan, to relax during
games.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll step off the mound, look around and see her walking around,"
Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Susan: "I do pace and I've been doing it since he was 7. I'm
just in wonderment how he does what he does."</TE>
<TE>   Simon benefits from playing for a team that doesn't make many
errors and rarely loses.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, the Lancers finished 27-2 and won the Southern
Section Division IV championship. This season, they are 17-2, have
won 15 consecutive games and are ranked No. 1 in Southern California
by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   "It is easy to be comfortable when you have a defense like ours,"
he said. "I don't have to worry about striking everyone out when you
know they're going to make the plays."</TE>
<TE>   Simon was a two-year starting receiver for the Lancer football
team. Many high school baseball players with professional aspirations
quit football for fear of injury. Simon never gave it a thought.</TE>
<TE>   "It was about having fun and being with my friends," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon has been greatly influenced by his parents. His mother runs
a summer program at Occidental College designed to introduce
low-income high school students to college life. His father, Barron,
drives an MTA bus. Together, they have pushed education and
achievement.</TE>
<TE>   "I think my parents brought me up the best way they could," he
said. "They taught me to be myself. If [people] don't want to accept
me for who I am, that's their loss."</TE>
<TE>   Simon learned early on about the ramifications of not trying his
best. Bringing home a C on his report card produced an immediate
response from his parents.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd get things taken away, privileges like going out to play or
talking on the phone," he said. "They got their point across."</TE>
<TE>   Simon had a 3.5 grade-point average last semester and has signed
with UCLA. His roommate at college figures to be Lancer football
player Wesley Walker.</TE>
<TE>   Simon is expected to be selected in the June amateur draft, but
his lack of height remains a concern to some scouts.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked myself, 'What can I do other than go out and play?' " he
said. "The question I ask is, 'Would you want a 6-6 tall, lanky
right-hander who can't do anything or a 5-11, 170-pound right-hander
who can play more than one position?' "</TE>
<TE>   Simon lives right behind Bishop Amat's football field. He's so
close to campus that he stays in bed until 7:45 a.m., gets dressed,
eats breakfast, hustles to his car and still makes it to school by
the time the bell rings at 8:05 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he gets up literally five minutes before homeroom," Susan
said. "I don't think he's walked to school one day in his life. With
my son, there are some things that defy explanation."</TE>
<TE>   One of the greatest athletic moments for Simon came last season,
when Bishop Amat defeated Ridgecrest Burroughs, 8-0, in the Division
IV final at Dodger Stadium. Simon was in center field on the final
out.</TE>
<TE>   "I just ran in and jumped on top of the pitcher and everyone fell
on top of me," he said. "I remember being on the bottom and we were
laughing and screaming. It was like we were little kids again."</TE>
<TE>   In a matter of weeks, Simon's high school career will be over.
He'll move on, probably to college, but always pointing toward his
goal of reaching the major leagues.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'm ready to leave, but at the same time, you don't want
to leave your friends," he said. "But it's for the best."</TE>
<TE>   Simon's sister is graduating this spring from Occidental College.
Then Simon will be out the door too.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to be sad because he's going to be in Westwood,"
Susan said. "I found a great pacing spot at UCLA."</TE>

<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>The San Antonio Spurs sure could have used David Robinson.</LD>
<LD>   The Seattle SuperSonics used strong inside play from Vin Baker and
Rashard Lewis to beat San Antonio, 98-90, Monday night at San Antonio
and even their best-of-five playoff series at 1-1.</LD>
<LD>   Gary Payton led Seattle with 21 points, and Lewis had 19. Baker
had 15 points and 10 rebounds before fouling out late in the fourth
quarter, and Desmond Mason scored 15. Payton also grabbed 11
rebounds.</LD>
<TE>   San Antonio's Tim Duncan led all scorers with 32 points and 12
rebounds. Steve Smith had 16 points, Tony Parker added 13 and Bruce
Bowen 11 for San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs went the last 5:25 without a field goal.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson didn't play because of a lower-back injury that forced
him to miss the last three games of the regular season. The 7-foot-1
center started Game 1 against Seattle but left in the first quarter
when his back tightened up. San Antonio won easily anyway.</TE>
<TE>   It was a different story Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   Baker scored seven points in the third quarter, and Jerome James
made two key baskets late in the period as Seattle turned a two-point
deficit into a two-point lead going into the final quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Bowen started the fourth with his third three-point basket of the
game to put the Spurs up by one, but the SuperSonics went on a 10-2
run to go ahead, 83-76, with about eight minutes remaining.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio got its chance when James fouled out with 3:48 left,
and Baker picked up his sixth a minute later with the SuperSonics up,
91-85.</TE>
<TE>   Both teams spent most of the remaining time on the free-throw
line, with the only basket coming on a breakaway dunk by Mason.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson had not missed a playoff game since 1992. The Spurs said
Robinson's status for Saturday's Game 3 will be reevaluated
Wednesday.</TE>

<KH>TENNIS LISA DILLMAN</KH>
<HD>Their Problems Appear to Be All in Their Heads</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They have paid attention to their bodies in motion, and it shows on
the court. There is little doubt that women are hitting the ball
better, serving harder and running faster, leading to an exciting
brand of tennis. Martina Navratilova set the standard, then Venus and
Serena Williams raised the bar.</LD>
<LD>   These days, some of the women on the tour would not look out of
place on the pool deck, ready to compete in the 200-meter butterfly
or in an international water polo match.</LD>
<LD>   Still, there's one problem. With all the attention to developing
the physique, one body part has been sadly neglected.</LD>
<TE>   The head.</TE>
<TE>   One veteran player agent, in casual conversation, noted that the
top players were lacking mental toughness. What got him thinking was
Daniela Hantuchova's early loss to Cara Black at Miami, after her
breakthrough title at Indian Wells.</TE>
<TE>   And that was before Justine Henin's mental struggles against Venus
Williams in the Amelia Island final. Henin, an immensely talented
baseliner, led, 6-2, 4-0, 40-15, and managed to lose.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran Henin watchers knew she could crumble, even after she'd
pulled herself together to lead in the third set, 5-3. It had
happened before, notably at the French Open last year when she lost a
semifinal to countrywoman Kim Clijsters after leading, 6-2, 4-2,
40-15.</TE>
<TE>   She has been shaky this year in a different way. For months, she
has been talking about her flagging confidence, saying she was
unnerved against Hantuchova at Indian Wells. This from a 2001
Wimbledon finalist.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is Amelie Mauresmo,  who felt the pressure before her
home fans at the French Open last year and lost to unheralded Jana
Kandarr of Germany in the first round. She hasn't been a serious
threat in a major event since.</TE>
<TE>   Mauresmo lately has been unable to win on clay, her favorite
surface. She lost her first match at Amelia Island to Anne Kremer of
Luxembourg, then to Patty Schnyder of Switzerland at Charleston.</TE>
<TE>   The tour hired an advertising agency last week to promote its
players. A better idea: traveling psychologists.</TE>
<TE>   Deja Vu</TE>
<TE>   Haven't we heard this before? Richard Williams says something and,
surprise, his daughters have no idea what he is talking about. Or he
agrees to some deal that Venus and Serena have no intention of
fulfilling.</TE>
<TE>   The Williamses are being sued by Women's Sports Zone Inc., which
maintains that Richard signed an agreement to have his daughters play
John and Patrick McEnroe in an exhibition. Attorney Keven Davis,
representing the sisters, said Venus and Serena never consented to
play the McEnroes.</TE>
<TE>   At the 2000 U.S. Open, in fact, Venus and Serena all but sneered
when John threw down the challenge to them. John kept it up, taking
shots at Venus and Serena through his various media outlets, and the
sisters responded by practically ignoring him, although Serena once
joked, "You want a piece of me?"</TE>
<TE>   The moral of this story: If Venus says something, listen. If
Serena says something, listen. If Richard says something? Well,
remember, he's the one who said he was going to buy Rockefeller
Center.</TE>
<TE>   Comebacks, Retirements</TE>
<TE>   Three-time French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil is ahead
of schedule in his recovery from hip surgery in February and is
planning to return to the circuit later this month. He resumed
practicing a little more than two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   For him, the road to the French Open will begin in Mallorca,
Spain, followed by tournaments in Rome and Hamburg.</TE>
<TE>   "We did everything we are used to doing on the court," said
Kuerten's longtime coach, Larri Passos. "He moved very well, in all
shots, and we didn't even remember he had undergone surgery. For the
next days, Guga will be playing sets and working on the details of
his preparation."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chris Woodruff, the U.S Davis Cup hero in the first round at
Zimbabwe in 2000, announced his retirement last week. The 29-year-old
had been on the ATP Tour since he turned pro in 1993, won two
tournaments, and was best known for winning the decisive match
against Wayne Black in Harare.</TE>
<TE>   Tournament Notes</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Open champion Lleyton Hewitt of Australia and Andy Roddick
have joined defending champion Andre Agassi as early entrants for the
Mercedes-Benz Cup at UCLA July 22-28.</TE>
<TE>   There will be 10 pre-qualifying events in California, starting at
Laurel Glen Tennis Club in Bakersfield on April 29-May 5 and ending
at Pacific Palms Tennis Center in Industry, July 8-10. From these
tournaments, the singles winner and runner-up and the winning doubles
team will receive spots in the wild-card tournament July 11-14.</TE>

<HD>World Cup Selections Based on Experience</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Arena's team, which appears stronger than past U.S.
squads, has plenty of veterans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometime last October, after the United States had defeated Jamaica
and clinched its place in the 2002 World Cup, Bruce Arena got out a
yellow legal pad and started doodling.</LD>
<LD>   When he found out in December that the U.S. would be playing
Portugal, South Korea and Poland in the first round of soccer's
quadrennial world championship, that doodling became a bit more
serious.</LD>
<LD>   And on Monday, 31/2 years after becoming coach of the American
team and after playing 57 games and taking a close look at 93
players, Arena finally finished jotting down names and scratching
lines through some of them.</LD>
<TE>   At 10 a.m., he picked up the telephone and called DaMarcus Beasley
in Chicago, telling the 19-year-old Fire midfielder that he made the
cut, that he was part of the 23-man U.S. roster for Korea/Japan '02.</TE>
<TE>   Beasley was the only player Arena contacted Monday. For the most
part, his weekend and that of his assistant coaches was spent
delivering bad news, telling players that they would not be going to
the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   That done, the team can now start preparing in earnest for the
U.S. team's opening game on June 5 against Portugal in Suwon, South
Korea.</TE>
<TE>   On paper, the 2002 U.S. team is considerably stronger than the one
former coach Steve Sampson took to the France '98 World Cup, where it
was ousted in the first round after losing to Germany, Iran and
Yugoslavia.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, it is older and more experienced, with an average
age of 28.7 years. Eleven players are holdovers from Sampson's 1998
team.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's bad having a team that's almost 29 years old,"
Arena said. "Hopefully, the experienced players are going to help us.
That's why there are so many veterans on this team."</TE>
<TE>   The goal of all 32 countries taking part in the May 31-June 30
tournament is to win it, but the U.S. is among the longest of
longshots.</TE>
<TE>   "If everyone aspires to win a World Cup, we have a long way to
go," Arena admitted, "but we have come a long way. If you compare
this team to the 1990 team, there's no comparison.</TE>
<TE>   "If you compare this team to the 1994 and 1998 teams, I believe
it's a better team based on the quality from top to bottom, and the
[amount of] experience."</TE>
<TE>   That said, Arena recognizes the gap that still exists between the
U.S. and the legitimate World Cup contenders.</TE>
<TE>   "It's no secret that the reason France and Argentina are odds-on
favorites to win the World Cup is that they have the best players,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They have considerable talent. They're leaving players home who
could make our team.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to just improve the depth in our program and the quality,
and that's going to take time."</TE>
<TE>   Arena split his choices almost evenly between players from Major
League Soccer and those playing for European teams.</TE>
<TE>   Although there are three of his former players from the University
of Virginia among the 23--Jeff Agoos, Claudio Reyna and Tony
Meola--sentiment was not a factor in their selection.</TE>
<TE>   "I selected this roster based on one simple thought: which 23
players could help us be successful," Arena said. "We don't look at
anything else besides that fact."</TE>
<TE>   Cobi Jones was the only Galaxy player chosen and became one of
seven players to make three World Cup rosters, along with goalkeepers
Meola, Brad Friedel and Kasey Keller, midfielders Reyna and Earnie
Stewart and forward Joe-Max Moore.</TE>
<TE>   The players will gather in Cary, N.C., on May 1 for 10 days before
moving north for three final warmup games: against Uruguay at
Washington, on May 12; against Jamaica at East Rutherford, N.J., on
May 16; and against the Netherlands at Foxboro, Mass., on May 19.</TE>
<TE>   The team leaves for South Korea on May 23. How far it will go once
it gets there remains a question, but Arena is optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been a guy that sets a whole lot of goals out there,"
he said. "But our players aren't stupid, they want to advance. That's
part of the challenge in a World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "Our focus over the next six weeks is going to be Portugal, and
after Portugal, South Korea, and then Poland.</TE>
<TE>   "If we take it one game at a time, we get a few breaks, we play
well, we take advantage of the opportunities, perhaps we're going to
put ourselves in position to be in the round of 16."</TE>

<AU>MOSHE ADLER</AU>
<BD>Moshe Adler is an economist in the urban planning
department at Columbia University. E-mail: ma820@columbia.edu.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This time it's Bill Gates himself who is repeating the mantra that
Microsoft never hurt consumers, and that it is only consumers who
will suffer if the corporation is forced to make Windows compatible
with competitors' software.</LD>
<LD>   If previous court rounds are any indication, many consumers and
most economists will side with Gates. Most consumers don't want to
struggle with installing different software programs. And economists
generally argue that unlike Standard Oil and other monopolies of the
past, which were bad for consumers, monopolies of the present are
good for consumers.</LD>
<LD>   What's amazing about all this is that the 1890 Sherman Antitrust
Act was not passed to protect consumers, and the monopolies of the
past were not bad for consumers. At least not according to Sen. John
Sherman. "Corporations tend to cheapen transportation, lower the cost
of production and bring within the reach of millions comforts and
luxuries formerly enjoyed by thousands," he told his colleagues on
the Senate floor when introducing his eponymous bill.</LD>
<TE>   Even the mother of all monopolies, Standard Oil, wasn't bad for
consumers. Or so believed journalist Henry Demarest Lloyd, Standard
Oil's staunchest enemy and the person who more than any other was
responsible for the agitation that resulted in the Sherman act. When
Lloyd exposed Standard Oil's many tricks, his article created such a
scandal that the Atlantic Monthly had to reprint its March 1881 issue
five times.</TE>
<TE>   Standard Oil, Lloyd had discovered, obtained lower freight rates
from the railroads while insisting that the same discounts not be
given to its competitors. This, of course, was unfair but not to
consumers. The price of kerosene that consumers paid actually went
down.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps even more stunning to contemporary readers of Lloyd's
article is the fact that by today's standards, Standard Oil wasn't
even unfair to its competitors. The president of the Pennsylvania
Railroad Co. offered to mediate between the independent oil producers
and Standard Oil. If they joined the trust they would get the same
rates, he suggested.</TE>
<TE>   Isn't such a buyout every entrepreneur's dream? It wasn't then.</TE>
<TE>   "More American than he," Lloyd reported, "they refused."</TE>
<TE>   One refiner described the meeting this way: "We gave him very
distinctly to understand that we didn't propose to go into any 'fix
up,' where we would lose our identity, or sell out, or be under
anybody else's thumb."</TE>
<TE>   In 1894, Lloyd retold the Standard Oil story in book form, calling
it "Wealth Against Common Wealth." This time his focus was Samuel van
Syckel, an innovative refiner. John D. Rockefeller wanted to buy him
out and offered him a comfortable lifetime salary and shares in
Standard Oil, but Van Syckel would not sell. "I want to make oil," he
told Rockefeller, becoming the hero of Lloyd's book. Once again
consumers were not the issue.</TE>
<TE>   The newspapers joined the push for antitrust legislation on behalf
of producers. The public agreed and Sherman responded to the outcry.
The "single object" of his bill, he told the Senate, was to protect
"industrial liberty." Could he have said it any more plainly?</TE>
<TE>   The dominance of Microsoft, not only in operating systems but also
in office products, is a matter of convenience, not technological
necessity. It is the result of consumers' need to communicate with
each other and of Microsoft's bold exploitation of this need. As
Assistant Atty. Gen. Joel Klein persuasively argued in the trial
phase, Microsoft deliberately makes its products incompatible with
the products of other manufacturers. This forces consumers to choose
the same products--Microsoft's.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers do not seem to mind. But rival producers do.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, protecting competitors may come at some cost to
consumers, because with different manufacturers involved,
compatibility glitches are bound to occur. If manufacturers have a
legal duty to avoid them, their incidence will be low, but there is
no doubt that some inconveniences are bound to remain.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, if this is the price that we have to pay as
consumers to maintain the opportunity for all of us to become
entrepreneurs, it is a very good deal indeed. The competing interests
of both consumers and producers must be weighed, because there is
more to life than consumption.</TE>

<HD>Le Pen's Upset Was Rooted in Fear of Crime</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWARD N. LUTTWAK</AU>
<BD>Edward N. Luttwak is a senior fellow at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over the past few years, there has been an explosion of crime in
France. While tourists who visit central Paris and Nice experience
conditions that are safer than in most American cities, people who
live in the suburban areas around Paris, Marseilles, Lyon,
Strasbourg, Bordeaux, Lille and a hundred other cities and towns have
been exposed to frequent brawls, car thefts, burglaries, vandalism of
public facilities, street robberies and acts of gratuitous violence.
Accompanying all this was the virtual abandonment of entire urban
areas by the police, especially poor areas where casual crime is most
frequent and where many police stations are closed at 6 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   Under the French Constitution, the president is responsible only
for foreign affairs while the prime minister and his government are
responsible for the economy, social policy and everything
else--including law and order.</LD>
<LD>   That was the problem for Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, the
Socialist who finished third in Sunday's presidential election.
Jospin was upset by Jean-Marie Le Pen of the far-right National
Front, whose campaign stressed France's rising crime rate. Le Pen
will face President Jacques Chirac, the top candidate, in a runoff
May 5.</LD>
<TE>   Le Pen's campaign not only targeted crime but also blamed
immigrants for much of it. France now has more than 4 million
Muslims. Most are law-abiding, but the teenage children of Algerian,
Moroccan and Tunisian immigrants often are disaffected by low
education levels, high unemployment and cultural confusion. Even when
not violent in a criminal sense, they keep people awake with loud
music, , they stay out in large, intimidating groups in public places
and they have turned many urban areas into places where most people
stay at home behind locked doors after dark, too afraid to go out.</TE>
<TE>   Both politicians and the media--who usually live in high-rent
central areas--have tended to ignore the increasing fear and
bitterness of the general population. Crime victims, their relatives
and neighbors saw hardly any mention of their acute distress on
television or in the newspapers, while politicians (except for Le
Pen) talked little about crime or the need for more public order. In
recent weeks especially, it was infuriating for ordinary French
people to see nonstop TV reporting of Palestinians complaining about
their suffering at the hands of the Israelis, while there was little
if any reporting of "Arab" crimes in their own streets and towns.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, when Jospin and other politicians did recognize the
crime issue, they mostly talked about the need for more social
programs and more help for the disadvantaged, without saying anything
about the need for more police, safety in urban areas and protection
for ordinary people.</TE>
<TE>   The result of all this was the huge vote for the "anti-Arab" Le
Pen in spite of his nationalist extremism, which most voters do not
like, and for Chirac, mainly because as president he is not
responsible for law and order.</TE>
<TE>   Jospin has announced that he will resign after the runoff. But
that leaves the government in the hands of the Socialists until the
June elections for the National Assembly, or Parliament. If they want
to survive politically, they will have to become a law and order
party. That has fiscal implications, because it would require that
French police forces be expanded.</TE>
<TE>   Le Pen's showing has wider implications as well. The rise of the
extreme right in Western Europe--including, besides Le Pen, Joerg
Haider in Austria and populists in Denmark, the Netherlands and
Switzerland--and of the right wing in Italy is shifting the political
balance, with a direct impact on the European Commission, which is
still dominated by the center-left. Although Germany has not seen the
street violence that France has, German voters are likely to come
down hard on the governing Social Democrats, who are also perceived
as "soft" on crime, in September's national elections.</TE>
<TE>   And a general turn to the right would certainly narrow the
political gap between the Bush administration and Western Europe.</TE>

<HD>The Palestinian Side Must Be Told</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SCHEER</AU>
<BD>Robert Scheer writes a syndicated column.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Is there media bias against Israel?</LD>
<LD>   The claim, hotly expressed in thousands of angry e-mails and
subscription cancellations, that the U.S. media are anti-Israel is so
absurd as to suggest hysteria. Are American Jews in such deep denial
about the brutality of Israel's recent actions that they would damn
those who report the truth?</LD>
<LD>   Certainly the American media are far more sympathetic to Israel
than publishers and journalists in the rest of the world. This is
particularly true in Western Europe, perhaps reflecting the
widespread public sympathy there for the Palestinians, as measured in
recent polls. Not that sympathy for Israelis, bloodied repeatedly by
a merciless bombing campaign targeting civilians, is not equally
warranted. It is my view that the prime historical responsibility for
the failure to make peace in the Mideast lies with the refusal of the
Arab nations to accept the justifiable existence of the Jewish state.</LD>
<TE>   However, the traditional absence of acknowledgement in U.S. news
reporting of the ongoing victimization of the Palestinians, powerless
from the beginning of their displacement half a century ago, is
callously immoral.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, no group is so safely denigrated in the mass media of
this country, particularly in film, as "the Arabs," who became the
enemy of choice in post-Cold War movie-making in such films as "True
Lies." And no group is as underrepresented in the media work force;
there are more than 3 million Arab Americans, yet it is exceedingly
rare to find one working as a newspaper reporter or TV news
personality.</TE>
<TE>   The American Society of Newspaper Editors doesn't even include
Arabs or Muslims in its annual monitoring of groups underrepresented
in the nation's newsrooms. Surely, if there were even a sprinkling of
people in the news biz who were hearing from relatives in Ramallah or
Jenin, it would influence the way events are interpreted.</TE>
<TE>   Jews are not underrepresented in the U.S. media ranks, and it is a
testament to their professionalism that their coverage is balanced.
Odd, though, that other Jews deem their work prejudiced against
Israel and at times even anti-Semitic; the convenient denigration is
that a Jewish journalist who dares disagree with the more hawkish
actions of Israel must be consumed with self-hate.</TE>
<TE>   Full disclosure: I am Jewish and I daily converse with Jewish
friends and acquaintances whose relatives, including their children,
are living through the hell that suicide bombers have brought to the
heart of Israel's civic life. Meanwhile, I have not a single
acquaintance who is personally connected with anyone on the
Palestinian side of events.</TE>
<TE>   I would hazard to guess that most Jewish editors and reporters
living in the United States are in a similar situation. Shouldn't
that make us less likely to be deeply affected by the traumas visited
upon Palestinian civilians by Israeli tanks and helicopters because
they have not been recounted by our own friends and family?</TE>
<TE>   It is to the immense credit of U.S. journalists of whatever
background that they stand broadly accused of being sympathetic to
the Palestinians--not because the charge rings true, but because it
indicates they have somewhat succeeded in humanizing the face of an
otherwise alien people. To humanize a people does not mean to
apologize for the behavior of murderous individuals, movements or
institutions representing the dark revenge fantasies of a people's
consciousness, of course. But to blindly endorse the outrage of one
side while ignoring the pain of the other does both a disservice.</TE>
<TE>   It would have been irresponsible for the media, Jewish or not, to
fail to report the depressing accounts of United Nations and other
observers that the Israeli onslaught was aimed at destroying all
signs of civic life as well as the stated purpose of rooting out
terror. Or to treat Palestinian civilian deaths as a necessary evil
made legitimate because they are caused by U.S.-supplied tanks and
choppers rather than by suicide bombers. There was a time when the
Zionist pioneers did not have tanks and helicopters and also placed
bombs to get rid of the British occupiers.</TE>
<TE>   The truths on both sides of this war are unfathomably ugly; the
media have performed a great service in alerting the world to them.
Now, it is up to all of us to demand that the powers of the world
intervene to halt the tragic carnage and push both sides toward
negotiations for a lasting peace.</TE>

<AU>JONATHAN TURLEY</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Turley teaches constitutional law at George
Washington University Law School and has served as counsel in
national security and espionage cases.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Zacarias Moussaoui was transferred to Virginia for trial as the
so-called 20th hijacker, Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft could have
reasonably assumed that the "rocket docket" would make quick work of
the accused terrorist. The problem is that Moussaoui is not
cooperating and, in a bizarre hearing Monday, he threw his trial into
disarray. Ironically, for the first time, the court, the prosecutors
and the defense attorneys appear to be in agreement: They are looking
at a disaster in the making.</LD>
<LD>   The turmoil began when Moussaoui appeared with his counsel and
raised his hand. When Judge Leonie Brinkema acknowledged him,
Moussaoui let loose with a tirade against the United States, Israel,
the court, the prosecution and, most important, his own attorneys.
Moussaoui accused his attorneys of pursuing "greed, fame and vanity"
in the case. He insisted that they were actively assisting the
government in his execution.</LD>
<LD>   Moussaoui then lashed at the judge as "a field general" leading
what he described as a "sophisticated version of the kiss of death."</LD>
<TE>   So as to guarantee not to leave any potential juror free of
attack, Moussaoui announced that he was a "slave of Allah" who prayed
continually for "the destruction of the United States of America" and
"for the destruction of the Jewish people and state." He then got
down to more mundane matters and asked for either the appointment of
a Muslim lawyer or the right to represent himself. Moussaoui noted
that he has $30,000 to pay for a Muslim attorney.</TE>
<TE>   As a threshold matter, Moussaoui does not have $30,000. The
government has custody of that money and insists that it was a
subsidy from the Al Qaeda organization to participate in the Sept. 11
attacks. Moreover, even if he could get the government to release the
money, $30,000 would not last beyond pretrial motions.</TE>
<TE>   For Moussaoui to secure a court-funded Muslim lawyer, the judge
would have to accommodate his discriminatory tastes for counsel.
However, the Constitution should not be a credit card for the
discriminating fanatic. There is no reason why the court should yield
to such a demand any more than it would tolerate a white
supremacist's demand for a white lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves self-representation. Of course, after his inaugural
performance in the hearing, no one wants Moussaoui to turn the
proceedings into the circus of the unhinged. However, to deny his
request for self-representation, the court would have to find
Moussaoui unfit to represent himself. Such a finding could jeopardize
the outcome of the case for the government. If Moussaoui is unfit to
represent himself, it would raise questions of whether he is legally
competent to stand trial or to receive the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   If Moussaoui is found to have "knowingly and intelligently" waived
his right to counsel, the Supreme Court has held that he must be
given the opportunity to represent himself. This would mean that the
self-proclaimed "slave of Allah" would have the opportunity to make
opening arguments, to examine and cross-examine witnesses and to make
objections. Because the same rules of evidence apply, it is unlikely
that he would succeed in the most minimum efforts of
self-representation. However, a self-represented defendant cannot
later claim "ineffective counsel," and he could be executed without
putting on any real defense.</TE>
<TE>   The court will likely retain Moussaoui's current defense counsel
as "friends of the court" to sit next to Moussaoui throughout the
trial in case he changes his mind. Things are likely to then go from
bad to worse. Although a defendant can be excluded from the courtroom
if he refuses to comply with the court's orders, it is more dicey
when the defendant is also the defense lawyer. Moussaoui may
inevitably be forced to watch portions of the trial by remote
television, leaving only the government in the courtroom. Moussaoui
could then be sentenced to die on the basis of a trial almost
entirely composed of government witnesses and argument. This
worst-case scenario is not just possible but likely.</TE>
<TE>   What is disturbing is that there appears to be considerable room
to challenge the charges against Moussaoui. The evidence introduced
against him is highly circumstantial and some of the legal charges
are questionable. These defenses will likely be lost in the ravings
of a zealot. That will neither serve the ends of justice nor
Moussaoui.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the Constitution does not protect a defendant from
self-inflicted wounds. If the government is correct about his alleged
training as a suicide bomber, Moussaoui may have finally found an
avenue for his unique self-destructive form of expression.</TE>

<LD>Far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen's second-place finish over
Socialist leader Lionel Jospin in the first round of French
presidential elections is an embarrassment not just for France but
all of Europe. Already, extremist parties have scored upsets in
Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Italy and Belgium. The
rise of the far right in France, which is one of the main backers of
the European Union, provides sustenance to xenophobic movements
across the Continent.</LD>
<LD>   Le Pen, 73, has described the Nazi gas chambers as "a detail" of
history. A paratrooper in the brutal war in Algeria, he now
represents the worst, most thuggish traditions of pre-World War II
Europe. He has little chance of defeating President Jacques Chirac in
the final runoff for the presidency May 5, but his success shows that
Europe cannot be complacent about a rash of anti-Semitic attacks and
rising anti-foreigner sentiment.</LD>
<LD>   Like most demagogues, Le Pen claims to represent the excluded, the
"little people" whom the establishment stomps on. There's not much
he's for, and he's against plenty. He has long denounced immigrants
(mainly the more than 4 million Muslims living in France), the
European Union and globalization. But Sept. 11 and the French
intellectual left's silly, impotent response to the war on
terrorism--which amounted to blaming America--created opportunity for
an intolerant backlash.</LD>
<TE>   European leaders must immediately nail shut the door that Le Pen
and his ilk are prying open. They need to say with resolve that the
war on terrorism does not legitimize immigrant-bashing; that anger
about Israel's current military campaign is no excuse for anti-Jewish
bigotry; that fascism has no place in the 21st century.</TE>

<LD>What happens behind the ornate closed doors at the Vatican this week
when senior American cardinals and bishops meet with Pope John Paul
II's inner circle is no longer merely of interest to the faithful.</LD>
<LD>   The church is facing its gravest challenge in modern history, one
that goes to the heart of its integrity and moral authority. In case
after alarming case, some priests have preyed upon the children who
trusted them. Worse, the church has repeatedly covered up the abuse
and thus allowed it to continue. So what happens in Rome this week is
a matter of large public concern. What has happened is more than a
public relations disaster for the church; it is a violation of the
law.</LD>
<LD>   As the scandal of pedophile priests in the church keeps growing in
its international scope, Catholic authorities continue to deal with
the problem in the most limited fashion possible. One diocese passed
the problem to another through transfers of pedophiles and a shameful
"it's not my problem" attitude: city to city, state to state, one
country to another, decade to decade.</LD>
<TE>   Even the Vatican meeting with American bishops involves denial by
suggesting that the crisis is uniquely American. The news from
Poland, Ireland, Mexico and other countries demonstrates otherwise.
Enough. The Roman Catholic Church must officially declare that it
will report all allegations of child abuse to local authorities. But
such a statement, however welcome, must not be a palliative to law
enforcement. Police agencies and prosecutors must aggressively pursue
investigations and prosecutions of priests who have not only broken
their religious commitments but have broken the laws that govern a
civil society.</TE>

<KH>THE SPRING AFTER THE TERROR</KH>
<HD>Pennsylvania's Sacred Spot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last fall, Paula Pluta's couch hugged the wall so she could look
through her large window at the hayfield and modest hickory forest
across the road. Today, the couch is turned toward the TV so Paula
can't see out. "My husband, Andy, was at work then," she said. "He
looks out now and sees deer over there. Me, I can only see that big
plane and, then--oh, my God!--that fireball."</LD>
<LD>   As spring makes its methodical way through the southern
Pennsylvania hills that locals call mountains, many things have
changed here--and beyond. Some changes since 9/11 are big, some
seasonal. Bright yellow coltsfoots bloom by the roadside again. Snow
was sparse this winter, but streams flow brisk and chilly. The radio
weight-loss ads are back in advance of swimsuit season, but merchants
keep ice salt out front in case. Red-winged blackbirds call from
fence lines and geese honk around ponds, including one just over from
a muddy hole that's drawing a new migration: the crash site of Flight
93.</LD>
<TE>   Not much certain is known about that flight, which is why the
simple field and 44 deaths fascinate so many who visit and those far
away. Exactly what happened aboard that hijacked plane that turned
toward Washington can only be imagined. Would it have crashed into
the Capitol? The White House? Been downed by U.S. missiles? Why did
that silver plane slowly lose altitude over Ohio and Pennsylvania?
When it sailed over the hill so low that some on the ground saw faces
inside and so noisily that cows fled to the woods for a week, was it
trying to land? Why did the plane flip at the end? Cockpit tapes
prove little.</TE>
<TE>   The distant crash spot, the vast open area of still-brown grass
cloaking an abandoned strip mine and the newly graveled overlook can
be anything anyone imagines. A sudden cemetery and sacred site, it's
also a crime scene; the FBI returns next month for a springtime
sweep. A sheriff's deputy sits 24-hour guard. By the hundreds daily,
pilgrims drive the twisting roads past crumbling barns, tidy gardens
and depleted stacks of firewood. They stroll quietly, leaning into
the constant wind that cracks the flags, topples flowers and photos
and whips hats back toward Pittsburgh. One woman played her harp for
an hour. Two busloads of Minnesota women came to pray.</TE>
<TE>   Residents near other tragedies grow tired of the demanding
attention, the media and sightseers. Not Shanksville. For local
volunteers like Nevin Lambert and Donna Glessner it's a
responsibility that fell, literally, from the sky. They stop by to
explain patiently to strangers what's known and not. Passengers and
crew wouldn't have known about the World Trade Center or their likely
doom if Flight 93 had been on time. They mutinied. Did they crash on
purpose? No matter, they're accepted heroes. Thousands of mementoes,
poems, painted stones and messages are left and carefully preserved
by local historians, pending a permanent memorial. "Angels Gather
Here," says one. A high school girl built a bench for a class
project, so many sit and pray and think.</TE>
<TE>   They think this is a very peaceful place. They think if terrorists
sought to spawn enduring fear, they surely failed. Even with the
immense empty field, no one feels alone. Strangers acknowledge each
other silently at the site as they walk or sit and think. They think
whatever happened overhead and way down by the trees, the innocents
on board were more heroes than victims. And they think recovery has
started.</TE>
<TE>   Paula Pluta keeps her Steven and Marissa playing near the house
now. She visits the site rarely. But sometimes this spring she looks
out that window and she too thinks. "Back then," she said, "you
couldn't imagine the evil that would do this. But what came out of it
all, for us anyway, was just this powerful niceness of everyone, even
strangers. You can't see it out there. But you can feel it in here."
And with that, the eyewitness touched her heart.</TE>

<LD>"Crackdown on Terror Funding Is Questioned" (April 7) contained
several mischaracterizations about the administration's efforts to
disrupt terrorist financing worldwide. It cites unidentified sources
as saying that "the Justice Department has expressed concerns to
senior Treasury officials about the strength of the asset-freezing
cases" and that other unnamed sources claim "the Treasury
Department's rush to action last fall may have been 'politically
driven' and premature."</LD>
<LD>   These comments are misleading, given the fact that no agency can
unilaterally designate an individual or organization as a terrorist
financier without the unanimous approval of every participant in the
interagency task force made up of the departments of the Treasury,
State, Justice, the FBI and the CIA. Treasury and Justice Department
lawyers assess the sufficiency of the evidence before we move forward
on any name.</LD>
<LD>   The article claims that the two U.S. Customs Service agents (part
of the Treasury Department) who were detailed to the FBI's Financial
Review Group "left and never came back." This is untrue--one agent
was recently promoted and another is working off-site as per his
duties within the Financial Review Group.</LD>
<TE>   Finally, it is illegal for Treasury agents to turn documents over
to the FBI until the FBI obtains either consent or a search warrant.
It is crucial that all our efforts remain well within the law to
protect the privacy of individual citizens and the integrity of
investigations.</TE>
<TE>   The Treasury and Justice departments have worked closely together
with the State Department, the CIA and others to track and block
terrorist funding. As a result of our cooperative and collaborative
effort, Treasury has blocked the accounts of 191 terrorist
financiers, we have frozen nearly $104 million in terrorist assets
worldwide, and 155 countries have followed our lead and issued
complementary blocking orders within their own borders. The financial
front in the war on terrorism, while quite different from the
military or humanitarian fronts, has continued to enjoy successes.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>This past February I took two of my adult children to the Lower East
Side Tenement Museum during a trip to New York ("Museum Plan Hits Too
Close to Home," April 18). I wanted them to see where and how my
grandparents lived and raised six children (yes, in a 350-square-foot
apartment very much like the one on the tour). I remember my mother
and her siblings always speaking lovingly of growing up on Orchard
Street, shopping on Delancey Street, helping their mother run her
poultry business and opening the fire hydrants in the summers to cool
down.</LD>
<LD>   Please, keep the museum as it is presently. Don't try to enlarge
it. The smallness of size and the cramped atmosphere are so evocative
of what it must have been like. We were moved to tears to realize
that even living like that was a gift to the newcomers to this
country. The museum is a wonderful reminder of where we came from.</LD>

<LD>The Times states in its April 18 editorial on LAPD Chief Bernard
Parks that the new prospective head of the LAPD must pass several
crucial leadership tests. It then unfortunately lists them, leading
with a call for a " . . . gender- and colorblind search . . . " for
the new chief. This clumsy, politically correct and morally confused
opening salvo paves the way for a slew of other absurd items on The
Times' left-of-center litmus test.</LD>
<LD>   Not one of the leadership recommendations by The Times concerns
the main duty of any police chief--the effective containment of
crime. This sort of blindness to the obvious is the heart and soul of
political correctness.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I was saddened to read that Laila Al-Marayati compares the plight of
the Palestinians to that of the Native Americans (Opinion, April 21).
I, a Jew, would mourn the demise of the Palestinians. I have a
suggestion or two to help prevent it. First, Palestinians must stop
suicide and homicide against fellow Palestinians. Does anyone know
how many people they have lost from suicide bombings and the massacre
of Palestinians "suspected" of collaborating with Israel? Or how many
Palestinians have been killed in wars they have started? To survive
as a people, they must revere the life of every individual.</LD>
<LD>   Also, Al-Marayati compares the Palestinians to Native Americans as
"a proud people who will fight to the bitter end." Yet she states
that "we live in a different time and place." She is right; the time
for fighting to the "bitter end" is long past. Palestinians and
Israelis must negotiate a workable peace with terms that will allow
each to prosper. If Israel had not been repeatedly attacked, which
wasted precious lives and resources in the Middle East, think of what
a thriving area it might be. Think of the statesmen, the diplomats,
the ambassadors, the scholars and the artists Palestinian society
might have developed--and might yet--with willingness to come to
terms of peace and stop killing their own and other people. Then they
will indeed be a "proud people."</LD>
<LD>   Sheila Golburgh Johnson</LD>
<TE>   Santa Barbara</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Al-Marayati conveniently forgot the million-plus Palestinians
living in Israel. Can anyone doubt that if the roles of the
Palestinians and Israelis were reversed, the Israelis would be the
Native Americans? The kind whose bones bleached in the desert sun.</TE>

<TE>   I am appalled that The Times ran '''We People of Faith Stand
Firmly With Israel,''' by Ralph Reed (Commentary, April 21). Many
innocent people died in the destruction of the World Trade Center
because of religious extremism. We don't need to promote that kind of
thinking in our newspapers. Reed should be reminded that we do have
separation of church and state in this great country. If Reed chooses
to base his life on mythology, that is his right. He should be
careful, however, how he spreads his garbage. As a military veteran
who served in three major wars in support of this nation's ideals, I
resent his position that non-Christian and non-Judaic humans have no
rights.</TE>
<TE>   George L. Salem</TE>
<TE>   Arroyo Grande</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reed's commentary reminds us in the Jewish community how grateful
we should be to our Christian friends who stand on the side of truth
and morality vis-a-vis Israel and, particularly, the Palestinians who
seek to destroy us.</TE>
<TE>   Understandably, Jews often have had trouble seeing Christians as
friends, given the years of persecution at their hands. But our
situation in the U.S. today is completely different. And as Reed
pointed out, innumerable Christians put their own lives at risk to
save Jews during World War II--precisely because their faith demanded
it. We Jews who are fortunate enough to live in the U.S. today should
publicly thank believing Christians for their support at this time.</TE>
<TE>   Judy Gruen</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a Christian, and one who has been involved in recent interfaith
dialogue programs here in L.A., I take deep offense at Reed's ugly
attempt to argue that all Christians stand with him in supporting the
brutal policies of the current Israeli government. The Christianity
of millions of people around the world, as exemplified by myriad
demonstrations and position statements of the past weeks, is one that
condemns all terror, whether authored by nonstate or state actors.
Our Christianity demands that we work for peace and reconciliation.
It is for that reason that we stand behind a two-state solution to
the current conflict, one in which both Israelis and Palestinians
live in viable states that offer them dignity, peace and security.</TE>
<TE>   Laurie A. Brand</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What a contrast between the commentary by Reed, formerly of Pat
Robertson's Christian Coalition, and the wonderful parody on the same
page ("Legal Vengeance Is Mine, Saith the Lord Almighty," by David
Martin). Reed praises Bush's Middle East policy (whatever it happens
to be this week) and joyfully anticipates Armageddon. Martin, a
Canadian attorney, incisively exposes the blatant hypocrisy of the
world's religious and political leaders who invoke and slander the
name of God while the human race continues to annihilate itself and
desecrate the planet Earth.</TE>

<HD>Ruling Stops Ashcroft at the Oregon State Line</HD>

<LD>Re "Do Your Job, Mr. Ashcroft," editorial, April 19: A lot of people
are offended that the attorney general consistently steps over the
line of performing his duties. It was no surprise that he tried to
interfere in Oregon's Death With Dignity Act. He is for snooping into
our personal bank records, tax returns, e-mails and homes. He says
that those who don't agree are giving aid and comfort to our enemies.</LD>
<LD>   He opposes allowing the FBI to determine if terrorist suspects
have purchased weapons.</LD>
<LD>   We in the National Organization for Women are especially incensed
about his constant crusades to make all abortion illegal and that he
has favored laws to outlaw common contraceptives.</LD>
<TE>   From holding Bible study sessions in government offices to
purchasing draperies to cover partially nude statues that have been
in the Justice Department for 70 years, we disagree with Atty. Gen.
John Ashcroft.</TE>
<TE>   Lila Pervier</TE>
<TE>   El Monte</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So it's rightly anathema for Ashcroft to involve himself in Oregon
state law. But remember when a federal judge ignominiously dumped the
will of California's voters and invalidated Proposition 187, despite
the fact that the federal government has de facto abrogated its
responsibility in protecting our borders?</TE>
<TE>   That The Times didn't have its ideological moral-indignation
meters blazing off the dial at this blatant subversion of popular
sovereignty is a dictionary-definition example of hypocrisy. Your
conception of "democracy" only goes as far as it serves your own
interests.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Cade</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When he was under consideration for the job of attorney general,
Ashcroft was asked pointedly if he could separate his moral beliefs
from his ability to uphold the laws of the United States. He stated
unequivocally that he would uphold the laws even if he disagreed with
them on moral grounds. Apparently his own morality does not rule out
lying to the American people. With his efforts to overturn the
assisted-suicide laws in Oregon and elsewhere, Ashcroft takes firm
hold in his personal morals to do away with laws--federal, state or
otherwise--with which he does not agree. His full-frontal assault on
civil liberties after Sept. 11 shows how reactionary and
ultraconservative he is.</TE>
<TE>   I predict that this will only be the beginning of Ashcroft's
one-man moral crusade to "clean up" his list of dirty laws in this
country. He was a bad choice then and he's an even worse reality now.
Hold onto your civil liberties, folks; it's going to be a bumpy
couple of years.</TE>

19: It is obvious that the American Palestinians quoted in your
article, such as [Downey businesswoman] Lily Karam and [executive
director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Washington]
Nahid Awad are not readers of The Times. The statement "Part of the
alienation . . . stems from a conviction that the Palestinian side of
the story is rarely heard in the U.S." is a joke.</LD>

<HD>Tollway Sale Clears Path for Freeway Repairs</HD>
<DH>Transportation: Authorities now hope to begin almost 15
projects, such as fixing bottlenecks, adding lanes and improving or
adding interchanges.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Declaring a new era for motorists on the Riverside Freeway, the
Orange County Transportation Authority agreed Monday to buy the
controversial 91 Express Lanes, clearing the way for $1.6 billion in
improvements to one of the most congested highways in Southern
California.</LD>
<LD>   The lanes, which run down the middle of the freeway for 10 miles,
will still be a toll road, although rates likely will be reduced.
Commuters now pay $4.75 each way at rush hour--one of the costliest
per-mile tolls in the nation.</LD>
<LD>   More important, the deal will allow Orange and Riverside counties
to proceed with a 30-year plan to improve the Riverside Freeway with
carpool lanes, new interchanges and widenings.</LD>
<TE>   Hundreds of millions of dollars has been earmarked for roadwork on
the Riverside Freeway, though most of the money must still be raised
through taxes and federal and state contributions.</TE>
<TE>   "We are breaking the logjam," said Arthur T. Leahy, OCTA's chief
executive officer who helped negotiate the deal with the toll road's
owners. "We want to move ahead as soon as possible. No improvement
will be off the table."</TE>
<TE>   The 91 Express Lanes, which run from the Riverside County line to
the Costa Mesa Freeway, were built in the mid-1990s for $140 million.
They are operated by California Private Transportation Co., a
partnership of Cofiroute, a French toll road company; Level 3
Communications and Granite Construction Co. OCTA board members, who
set out to buy the road in September, unanimously approved the
$207.5-million deal, which they described as a crucial step for
repairing the only major highway linking Orange County--with its
ample job market--to the fast-growing Inland Empire.</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of the deal, OCTA will assume the toll operator's debt
of $135 million and pay the company $72.5 million in cash. Authority
officials now have 45 days to review the operator's financial records
to determine whether the company is sound.</TE>
<TE>   The sale is also contingent upon the Legislature granting OCTA the
power to charge tolls. The purchase could be completed as early as
July.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the deal, Riverside County has agreed to drop a lawsuit
against the toll operator and Caltrans, which challenged the
constitutionality of the tollway's non-competition agreement. The
case was set for trial late this year.</TE>
<TE>   The purchase, officials said, should allow cooperation between
Riverside and Orange counties. Relations have been strained by OCTA's
early support for the Express Lanes and Riverside County's proposal
to build a highway through the Cleveland National Forest into
southern Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   The deal will eliminate the controversial protection agreement
between the private toll operator and Caltrans that prohibited major
improvements to the Riverside Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement covers 30 miles of the freeway, from Interstate 15
in Riverside County to the Los Angeles County line. It was designed
to protect the tollway's profits--the more congested the freeway, the
more drivers would pay to ride the toll lanes. The protection
agreement was to end in 2030.</TE>
<TE>   While the 91 Express Lanes reduced congestion when they opened six
years ago, the tollway was eventually viewed as an obstacle to
accommodating traffic growth on the Riverside Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Motorists now make about 250,000 to 270,000 trips daily on the
freeway, the majority from the Inland Empire during morning and
evening rush hours.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the region's dramatic growth, the number of trips is
projected at more than 400,000 a day by 2020. Although the increase
is good for the toll business, it means slower speeds and longer
commutes.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole model is flawed," said Orange County Supervisor Todd
Spitzer, chairman of OCTA's board of directors and a critic of the
Express Lanes. The tollway "relied on congestion and a lack of
mobility to get people to pay. It's bad public policy."</TE>
<TE>   Once the sale is completed, Orange and Riverside counties hope to
work on almost 15 projects, such as fixing freeway choke points,
adding lanes and improving or building interchanges.</TE>
<TE>   Already, OCTA is adding an $8-million auxiliary lane to less than
a mile of the freeway to relieve a bottleneck. Officials said
additional restriping and carpool lanes can be quickly added after
the deal closes.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA plans to continue the tollway operation until the private
toll company's debt is paid. After a traffic and revenue study, Leahy
said, the tolls will probably be reduced to attract more motorists.
Tolls have been raised seven times in six years..</TE>
<TE>   Officials from Riverside and Orange counties said they will seek
state, federal and local funding, including money from Measure A,
Riverside County's tax for transportation projects.</TE>
<TE>   The Riverside County Transportation Commission has earmarked
almost $500 million in Measure A funds for improvements to the
Riverside Freeway. An extension of the tax will be on the November
ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "We can now spend money on asphalt instead of attorneys," said
Riverside County Supervisor Bob A. Buster.</TE>

<TE>   Caltrans officials declined to comment on the sale, saying they
have not seen its terms, and because the lawsuit against the
department and the toll operator has not been dismissed yet.</TE>
<TE>   Under the purchase agreement, a Riverside Freeway committee will
be set up with two Caltrans directors, four members of the Riverside
County Transportation Commission and four OCTA board members. The
group will set policy for the tollway and improvement projects.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides said they thought the sale price was fair given the
tollway's improving revenue and the $200-million cost of building a
similar section of public highway today.</TE>
<TE>   Analysis by OCTA and the accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Young
determined that the lanes were worth between $202 million and $220
million.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA officials pointed out that over the past several years
several factors conspired against the tollway--changing political
support because of the noncompetition agreement, Riverside County's
lawsuit, and Level 3's deteriorating financial condition.</TE>

<HD>Suspect in Motor Rampage on Trial</HD>
<DH>Courts: Lawyer outlines insanity defense for David Attias,
accused of killing four pedestrians near UC Santa Barbara. Photos
show aftermath.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SANTA BARBARA</DL>
<LD>Comparing a shattered mirror to his client's fractured mind, the
attorney for accused motor rampage killer David Attias said the
teenager could not have grasped what he was doing the night he ran
down five people on a crowded Isla Vista street.</LD>
<LD>   In opening statements Monday in the murder trial of the former UC
Santa Barbara freshman, defense lawyer Jack Earley said Attias
suffered from apocalyptic visions, believed he had a special gift to
see evil in others, and rambled incoherently as his mental disease
overtook him.</LD>
<LD>   ''He became delusional,'' said Earley, addressing the seven-man,
five-woman jury. ''He talked about good and evil. He thought it was
his job to spread good.''</LD>
<TE>   How that translated into one of the more devastating campus
tragedies to strike a California college in years will be explained,
Earley said, by a procession of therapists and counselors who treated
Attias before and after the incident that claimed four lives in the
largely student community adjacent to UC Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   Earley addressed the jury after an opening statement by Santa
Barbara Assistant Dist. Atty. Patrick McKinley, who posted still
photos of the gruesome accident scene as the trial got underway.</TE>
<TE>   Because Attias has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, the
central issue is not whether he was at the wheel the night of Feb.
23, 2001, but whether he should be held criminally responsible. He
faces four counts of murder, as well as four counts of gross
vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated.</TE>
<TE>   Earley's contention was that Attias had no concept of what he was
doing when he ran a stop sign and plowed into a mixed group of
students and visitors walking along the street.</TE>
<TE>   As Earley spoke, the defendant showed little emotion, but drank
frequently from a cup of water. Attias was dressed in a gray sweater
that, along with his ruddy cheeks and baby-faced features, made him
look even younger than his 19 years.</TE>
<TE>   The accident's only survivor, Albert Levy, was also in court along
with some of his friends. Levy had been visiting his sister, Ruth,
with friend Elie Israel that night. Israel and Ruth Levy, along with
Nicholas Bourdakis and Christopher Divis, both 20, were killed.</TE>
<TE>   According to Earley, the then-18-year-old freshman's world was
slowly coming undone in the weeks leading up to the tragedy.
Diagnosed as having a bipolar disorder, he had stopped taking
medication, grown angry at his father--Hollywood producer Daniel
Attias--and become more and more obsessed with what he saw as the
catastrophic consequences of his continuing virginity.</TE>
<TE>   The still photos that the jury saw Monday were taken from a
videotape of the incident made by amateur filmmakers who happened by
just after the accident. The tape, which will be shown later,
reportedly shows Attias running around in the street, shouting ''Ride
or Die,'' and calling himself the ''angel of death.''</TE>
<TE>   While it's become increasingly clear since the accident that
Attias was deeply disturbed, Earley tried to lay out for the jury the
full extent of it. As Attias' mind fell apart, according to Earley,
he began to believe that the musicians he admired were prophets and
that their lyrics were keys to unlock the mysteries of life and
death.</TE>
<TE>   Earley said the young man was so troubled by a long history of
psychological problems that he should not be thrown in prison but
placed in a mental institution ''where he can get treatment."</TE>
<TE>   Earley said that, given Attias' mental problems, the only reason
his client is facing a murder charge is because four people died.</TE>
<TE>   ''The major issue,'' he said, ''is that there is no evidence he
intended to do this.''</TE>
<TE>   Some witnesses, however, have said Attias' 1991 Saab was
accelerating when it hit the pedestrians.</TE>
<TE>   The trial before Superior Court Judge Thomas Adams is expected to
last eight weeks.</TE>

<HD>20 Cited at Fillmore Cockfight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Twenty people were cited and nearly five dozen roosters seized during
a weekend raid of a cockfighting operation in a Fillmore orchard.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said Monday that another dozen people will be cited
this week. Cockfighting is a misdemeanor punishable by up to six
months in jail or fines of up to $1,000.</LD>
<LD>   The Ventura County Sheriff's Department was tipped about a
cockfight near Balcom Canyon and South Mountain roads, Senior Deputy
Don Jennings said. Deputies arrived about 10 p.m. Sunday to find 59
roosters--including five injured and three dead. Dozens of people
fled the scene.</LD>
<TE>   Deputies found a 20-foot wooden arena, scales to weigh the
roosters and knives. In a cockfight, two roosters, with razors or
knives attached to their legs, fight to the death.</TE>
<TE>   Because of their aggressive nature, the confiscated roosters will
be destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's impossible to place animals like that into a home with other
animals because they are trained to fight," said Tim Dewar of the
Ventura County Humane Society.</TE>

<HD>Blake Pleads Not Guilty to Killing</HD>
<DH>Courts: Prosecutors allege the actor ordered bodyguard to
make a list of items to use to kill Bonny Lee Bakley.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE and ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While plotting to kill his wife, actor Robert Blake directed his
bodyguard to prepare a list of supplies, including two shovels, a
crowbar, old rugs, duct tape and swimming pool acid, Los Angeles
County prosecutors allege in a criminal complaint filed Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Blake, who pleaded not guilty to murder, soliciting murder and
conspiracy charges during his arraignment Monday, fatally shot Bonny
Lee Bakley in the head outside a Studio City restaurant May 4, only
after he failed to recruit other people to kill her for him,
according to the complaint filed at Van Nuys Superior Court.</LD>
<LD>   Blake offered two prospective killers a small-caliber gun in a
zippered case and told one of them the gun was untraceable, the
complaint said. He also told one of them that his bodyguard, Earle
Caldwell, would have "dug holes for burial."</LD>
<TE>   According to prosecutors, Blake also directed Caldwell, who Monday
pleaded not guilty to a murder conspiracy charge, to make a list of
supplies needed to kill Bakley--"two shovels, small sledge, crowbar,
.25 auto, 'get blank gun ready,' old rugs, duct tape, Drano, pool
acid, lye, plant."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday, Los Angeles police arrested Blake at his daughter's home
in Hidden Hills, a gated community in the San Fernando Valley, and
took Caldwell into custody near his Burbank home.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Blake's motive was "contempt for Bonny Bakley and the
marriage he felt was forced upon him." Blake married Bakley after a
paternity test confirmed he was her baby girl's father.</TE>
<TE>   Blake, best known for his role as the streetwise New York
detective Tony Baretta in the 1970s television series "Baretta,"
could face the death penalty if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   He is being held without bail in Men's Central Jail in downtown
Los Angeles. Bail for Caldwell is set at $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Blake, 68, was dressed in a light gray suit and tie
with his attorney, Harland W. Braun, standing behind him. Caldwell,
46, sat next to Blake, wearing a white dress shirt and slacks, as his
lawyer, Arna H. Zlotnik, stood behind him.</TE>
<TE>   The defendants spoke only to enter their not guilty pleas before
Commissioner Michael Duffey. A preliminary hearing is expected to be
scheduled May 1.</TE>
<TE>   According to the complaint, Blake asked one prospective killer,
whose identity was not revealed, to hide in his van in a remote
desert area and kill Bakley in March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The same month, Blake asked the second unidentified person to kill
Bakley as she sat in a parked car near Bullhead City, Ariz., the
complaint alleges.</TE>
<TE>   Blake told both people that Vitello's restaurant in Studio City,
which is near where Bakley was killed, might provide an alternative
spot, according to Deputy Dist. Attys. Patrick R. Dixon and Gregory
A. Dohi.</TE>
<TE>   The actor used an AT&amp;T prepaid phone card he bought March 11,
2001, at a 7-Eleven store to call both of the people he asked to kill
his wife, prosecutors allege, so he would not leave "any record of
the calls on his personal phone bill."</TE>
<TE>   In April 2001, Bakley, Blake and Caldwell traveled together to
Parker, Ariz., and Three Rivers, Calif., the complaint says.</TE>
<TE>   "Caldwell, armed with a handgun, hid in the bushes on the banks of
a river and jumped out while defendant Blake and Bonny Lee Bakley
were together," the complaint says. Prosecutors did not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Bakley family attorney Cary W. Goldstein said the incident was
"either an attempt to murder Bakley or an attempt to make her fear
for her life.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why that was aborted," said Goldstein, who plans to
file a civil lawsuit on behalf of the Bakley family. "I think Earle
just couldn't go through with it."</TE>
<TE>   On May 4, 2001, Bakley, 44, was shot and killed while waiting in
Blake's 1991 Dodge Stealth near Vitello's, where the couple had
dined.</TE>
<TE>   Blake told police he returned to the restaurant to retrieve a
handgun and returned to find his wife slumped over in the passenger
seat of his car.</TE>
<TE>   But prosectors said he drove Bakley to the restaurant, parked his
car behind a dumpster, lowered the passenger window, got out of the
car and kept the keys.</TE>
<TE>   Then, he shot her twice with "an unregistered vintage Walther P38
military 9mm handgun," according to the complaint.</TE>
<TE>   The gun was found in a trash dumpster nearby shortly after the
slaying.</TE>
<TE>   Braun said he is suspicious about the basis for the complaint,
saying he believed most of the information came from Bakley's sister,
Margerry. Braun said her testimony would be hearsay in a trial.</TE>
<TE>   He added that Blake wants Caldwell to testify. The list of items
that prosecutors said Caldwell wrote in preparation for the slaying
was actually a list of pool supplies, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Braun said he expects in the next few days to learn the names of
the two people Blake allegedly solicited to murder Bakley.
Prosecutors handed over 12 boxes of materials to Braun on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Bakley married Blake in November 2000, after a paternity test
proved he was the father of 5-month-old Rose. The couple lived in
separate houses on Blake's property in Studio City. Family and
friends said Bakley ran a mail-order business in which she solicited
money by promising sex and nude photos.</TE>
<TE>   Blake and his daughter, now almost 2, moved to Hidden Hills to
live with Blake's adult daughter, Delinah.</TE>
<TE>   Margerry Bakley, who attended the court hearing Monday, said it
was awful seeing Blake and Caldwell. She said she came to the hearing
"to see for myself that he was really being charged, to know that it
was really being done."</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe they planned this," Bakley said as she started
crying. "They preyed on her. They dug holes."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Andrew Blankstein contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Judge Refuses to Throw Out Charges in Kidnapping Case</HD>
<DH>Crime: Defendants could now face trial in the abductions
for ransom, which culminated in the recent discovery of five bodies
in a lake in Northern California.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paving the way for trial, a federal judge on Monday denied a motion
to dismiss charges against two of the six defendants in an
international kidnap-for-ransom case.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Nora Manella also disqualified attorney Victor
Sherman from further representing Iouri Mikhel.</LD>
<LD>   The judge said the lawyer's simultaneous representation of another
defendant in the case constituted an "extremely serious potential for
conflict" of interest.</LD>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors accuse Mikhel, 37, of kidnapping two of the
four Los Angeles victims whose bodies were found last month in a
Northern California lake. A fifth body was found in the same lake,
New Melones near Sonora, last October.</TE>
<TE>   While Manella gave Mikhel three weeks to find a new lawyer, she
allowed Sherman to continue representing Andrei Agueev, 34, who is
charged with receiving about $235,000 in ransom money paid by a
victim's family to Agueev's bank account in the United Arab Emirates.</TE>
<TE>   Also charged with Agueev is Andrei Liapine, 41, who is accused of
helping transfer the ransom money to Latvia.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, Agueev and Liapine, both Russian nationals, face a
maximum sentence of 10 years in federal prison.</TE>
<TE>   The motion to dismiss was filed by Sherman for Agueev and by
attorney Edward Robinson for Liapine.</TE>
<TE>   Mikhel and three other defendants--Jurijus Kadamovas, 35, of
Encino; Petro "Peter" Krylov, 29, of West Hollywood; and Ainar
Altmanis, 42, of Sherman Oaks--may face the death penalty if
convicted.</TE>
<TE>   They are accused of either directly kidnapping or aiding an
abduction that resulted in death, said Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the
U.S. attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   The six defendants, all of whom have roots in the former Soviet
Union, have pleaded not guilty and are being held in Los Angeles
without bail.</TE>
<TE>   They have not been charged with murder, although authorities did
not rule out the possibility of filing additional charges.</TE>
<TE>   A seventh suspect, Alexandr Afonin, remains at large. Afonin is
charged with persuading Agueev and Liapine to accept ransom money.</TE>

<HD>Developer Put on Probation in Bribe Case</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge cites his long community service, cultural
differences over 'gratuities' for officials. U.S. prosecutors wanted
prison time for payoff; they may pursue appeal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a blow to prosecutors, a federal judge sentenced a real estate
developer Monday to three years' probation for paying a $4,000 bribe
to the mayor of Huntington Park.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. rejected a government
request that developer Harry Hwang, 49, be sentenced to three years
in prison.</LD>
<LD>   Hwang, who lives in Hancock Park, pleaded guilty to making the
payment to Mayor Richard Loya for his support of a proposed
$110-million shopping center in Huntington Park.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Loya went to the FBI after receiving a bribe
offer and wore a concealed recording device during several subsequent
meetings with Hwang.</TE>
<TE>   Hatter, departing significantly from federal sentencing
guidelines, cited what he said were extenuating circumstances in the
case.</TE>
<TE>   They included Hwang's extensive record of community service;
cultural differences between his native Korea and the U.S. over
giving gratuities to public officials; and the possibility that Hwang
might have been enticed into making the bribes.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. attorney's office, which maintains that Hwang acted
freely and willingly, said it is considering asking the Justice
Department for permission to appeal Hwang's sentence.</TE>
<TE>   "We made the best argument we could to the judge," said Assistant
U.S. Atty. Daniel N. Shallman. "He obviously disagreed, but we will
continue to prosecute these public corruption cases to the fullest
extent possible to send a strong message to those who would make
payoffs and those who take them."</TE>
<TE>   Hwang, who emigrated to the United States 21 years ago, appeared
in court with about 30 relatives and friends. He apologized for his
crime.</TE>
<TE>   While awarding him probation, the judge ordered Hwang to spend six
months in a halfway house with weekends off, partly to deal with a
drinking problem. He also was fined $10,000.</TE>
<TE>   Hatter said he had received more than 100 letters of support from
Hwang's relatives, friends and business acquaintances, including an
especially moving one from the defendant's 17-year-old daughter.</TE>
<TE>   In seeking probation, defense lawyer Brian Hennigan argued that
the payments to Loya were "gratuities" as opposed to "bribes" because
they were given without any specific quid pro quo.</TE>
<TE>   Shallman disputed that claim, citing excerpts from secretly record
conversations between Hwang and the mayor.</TE>
<TE>   Hwang pleaded guilty to two counts of bribery.</TE>
<TE>   The bribery case grew out of his bid to develop a huge retail and
entertainment center in the city.</TE>
<TE>   According to federal authorities, Hwang sought Loya's help in
getting a $7-million city subsidy for the project.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange, they said, Hwang offered to make Loya the
development's property manager after he left office.</TE>
<TE>   Hwang also proposed laundering campaign contributions to the mayor
through tenants at a mini-mall he owns, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, federal authorities said, Hwang offered to pay for a
cruise that Loya and his wife were planning to take to Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   FBI agents videotaped Hwang outside the Bonaventure Hotel in
downtown Los Angeles in August as he handed Loya an envelope
containing $4,000 in $100 and $20 bills.</TE>

<HD>Catholics Proclaim Their Faith</HD>
<DH>Religion: Despite the current sex scandal, a record number
of O.C. adults are confirmed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL LOBDELL and DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even as the largest scandal in the history of the Roman Catholic
Church in the United States stretches into its fourth month, a record
number of Orange County adults decided Monday to make a lifetime
commitment to the faith.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 400 adults--baptized in infancy as Catholics but who
somehow missed the second rite, confirmation--went through the
ceremony at St. Columban Church in Garden Grove before an overflow
crowd of 1,700. Last year, 220 adults in Orange County were confirmed
in the Catholic Church.</LD>
<LD>   The show of faith mirrors recent survey results that the recent
sex-abuse scandal, which first surfaced in Boston this year, has not
driven Catholics from the church.</LD>
<TE>   The Catholic Church across Southern California also reported
record numbers of converts who came into the church this Easter. In
the Los Angeles archdiocese, for example, about 3,350 converted this
year, compared to 2,770 last year. Orange County had a 9.5% increase
in new Catholics this year.</TE>
<TE>   Will Alvarez of Anaheim, among those confirmed Monday, said he has
never doubted his faith. But he said the controversy made for an
interesting lead-in to the service.</TE>
<TE>   "The timing of the confirmation is odd," said Alvarez, 29. "But
just because of a few bad apples, that doesn't change what the
Catholic Church stands for."</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Tod D. Brown, who performed the rite Monday night with the
help of four priests, said the record turnout shows the strength of
the church's truth, even amid controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's remarkable, really," Brown said. "I've never had a
confirmation class of adults this large. It's very encouraging [that]
these people are making the move ahead even with the backdrop."</TE>
<TE>   Brown did not duck the sex-abuse scandal during the ceremony,
telling the crowd, "We've given you a very difficult Lenten period.
The trials aren't over yet. But Easter gives us hope."</TE>
<TE>   A leader of the program, Mike Shaffer, said of the newly
confirmed, "These folks want to become more involved Catholics.
Confirmation is a time when the Holy Spirit enters the person's soul
in a profound way. They are saying, 'I want to live my life as a
committed Catholic.' "</TE>
<TE>   Confirmation is a Roman Catholic sacrament usually taken by
adolescents who want to accept personal responsibility for their
baptismal vows. For a variety of reasons, the Catholics at the St.
Columban's ceremony never did so as children.</TE>
<TE>   James Harter, 26, of Huntington Beach said he didn't have a
problem reconciling his faith in the Catholic Church, but that didn't
stop his friends from giving him some grief.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal "was a point of some humor and some jokes," Harter
said. "You think about what's going on. But it's good to have
something to go to during these times."</TE>
<TE>   The ceremony came on the eve of an unprecedented two-day meeting
in Rome between Vatican officials and U.S. Cardinals to figure out
how best to deal with the sex scandal. On Monday, prelates were
divided on whether Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston should resign. Law,
who has refused to step down, had knowingly transferred from parish
to parish priests who had molested children.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal has touched the Diocese of Orange, with three priests
removed from their parishes and two major settlements, including one
for $5.2 million for a single victim, within the last year.</TE>

<LD>A special team of Navy investigators has joined the expanding probe
into the fiery crash of a Vietnam-era fighter jet at the Point Mugu
Air Show over the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   The team comprises experts from military bases in Washington,
D.C.; Norfolk, Va.; and San Diego, who will examine possible causes
of the crash, including mechanical malfunctions and a collision with
birds.</LD>
<LD>   Navy Cmdr. Michael Norman, 39, of Camarillo and Marine Corps.
Capt. Andrew Muhs, 31, who lived at the Ventura County base, were
killed Saturday when their QF-4 Phantom plunged to the ground and
exploded in flames as thousands of air show spectators watched.
Norman was the pilot and Muhs the navigator.</LD>
<TE>   No one on the ground was injured when the jet peeled away from a
low-flying formation, wobbled out of control and pitched to the right
before crashing into marshland just west of Point Mugu. Witnesses
said they saw smoke and flames spewing from the jet's engines before
it went down.</TE>
<TE>   Moments after the crash, special military agents stationed at the
base converged on the jet's hangar and confiscated maintenance logs
containing all operational records on the jet, said a source familiar
with the investigation. The agents were there to provide extra
security after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Sources familiar with the investigation said they are pursuing a
number of theories about what caused the crash.</TE>
<TE>   Among the possibilities are a mechanical malfunction that
destroyed the jet's control system, faulty maintenance and birds
flying into the aircraft's engines.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing has been ruled out, although pilot error is considered
unlikely, sources said.</TE>

<LD>A special team of Navy investigators has joined the expanding probe

Air Show over the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   The team comprises experts from military bases in Washington,
D.C.; Norfolk, Va.; and San Diego, who will examine possible causes

<LD>   Navy Cmdr. Michael Norman, 39, of Camarillo and Marine Corps Capt.

base converged on the jet's hangar and confiscated maintenance logs
containing all operational records on the jet, said a source familiar
with the investigation. The agents were there to provide extra
security after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Base officials said it may be months before the cause of the crash
is determined.</TE>
<TE>   Pieces of charred wreckage remained spread Monday across a
300-foot strip of farmland next to the Ventura County Game Reserve.</TE>
<TE>   Sources familiar with the investigation said they are pursuing a
number of theories about what caused the crash.</TE>
<TE>   Among the possibilities are a mechanical malfunction that
destroyed the jet's control system, faulty maintenance and birds
flying into the aircraft's engines.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing has been ruled out, although pilot error is considered
unlikely because of the aviators' experience, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   One scenario being examined is whether one or more birds were
sucked into the jet's engines.</TE>
<TE>   In the summer of 2000, a $70-million E2-C Hawkeye, designed to
detect missile threats, sucked two ducks into its engines.</TE>
<TE>   The crippled plane dipped and glided about 9,000 feet before
making a hard landing in a field at the end of the Point Mugu runway.
The three crew members escaped unharmed, but the plane was destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   After the crash, base officials installed high-tech radar
equipment and hired a full-time base employee to prevent bird
strikes.</TE>
<TE>   Still, workers on the base say flight crews are at risk because
more than 60 species of birds live and hatch their young in the marsh
near the base.</TE>
<TE>   "They were really good pilots," said a base employee who worked
with Norman and Muhs. "Nothing they did that day got them killed. It
was the [mechanical problems] or a bird."</TE>
<TE>   Air show planners acknowledged the crash took an emotional and
financial toll on the event, but said they are already planning next
year's event.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a rough few days, but this is a risk and it could
happen any time anywhere," said Don Lewis, the show's director and a
retired naval pilot who had been stationed at the base. "[Air shows]
still show people where their tax dollars are going. It's more than
just an air show. We use the aviation part to get people out to see
everything else."</TE>
<TE>   Base spokeswoman Teri Reid said a private military memorial for
Norman and Muhs is set for 10 a.m. Thursday at the Naval Base Ventura
County Chapel of Faith.</TE>
<TE>   "Like any other funeral or memorial, it's a way for people to come
together and give and show support for the Norman and Muhs families
and honor the two aviators," Reid said. Plans for a public memorial
have not been completed.</TE>

<HD>Taking Lessons From the Sadness</HD>
<DH>Grief: Friends say they have learned from the death of
15-year-old Deanna Maran, killed during fight at a party.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTHA GROVES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Perhaps Ryan Natale, all of 15, best captures how friends and family
struggle to make sense of the murder of Deanna Maran.</LD>
<LD>   "I just want to take it as a learning experience," said Natale, a
Santa Monica High School classmate who held Maran in his arms after
she was stabbed by a 17-year-old girl at a crowded Westside party.
How tragic, he said, that "God had to take someone so great to teach
us all a lesson."</LD>
<LD>   Although Maran's was one violent teen death among the many that
occur each year in California, her killing has generated a remarkable
amount of controversy and national media attention.</LD>
<TE>   First, there was the girl-versus-girl aspect. Moreover, the
killing occurred on a tree-lined street in an upscale neighborhood.
Maran was known by those closest to her as LaLa, and she was famous
for her prodigious appetite. So it was fitting that her relatives,
friends and teachers gathered last week to celebrate her life with a
feast--chow mein, steamed salmon with dill, satay, strawberries
dipped in chocolate. It would have been her 16th birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of admirers young and old crowded into the Maran family's
Ocean Park home to revel in memories of the brainy, fun-loving
sophomore. The partygoers reminisced over scrapbooks and swapped
tales about Maran's dogged determination, wacky wit and penchant for
treating friends' refrigerators as her own.</TE>
<TE>   A strapping 5-foot-6, 158-pound water polo and volleyball player,
Maran was stabbed in the heart Nov. 17. The next day, Katrina
Sarkissian, her killer, collapsed while being questioned at a West
Los Angeles police station and died at UCLA Medical Center. An
autopsy revealed that she had taken an overdose of antidepressant
tablets.</TE>
<TE>   Friends of Maran who went to the Saturday night party last
November say the stabbing was so swift and unexpected that they had
no chance to intervene. Others are tortured by thoughts that they
could have stopped a tragedy, if only they had been there.</TE>
<TE>   Questions--the need to take lessons from the tragedy--abound:</TE>
<TE>   How did so many unchaperoned kids--from Santa Monica High as well
as from some of the area's best private schools--gravitate to the
party that night? Why did some partygoers urge the girls on,
cheering, "Fight! Fight!"? Why didn't anyone try to stop it? Where
were the adults?</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone's looking for a greater meaning in this," said Harland
W. Braun, an attorney representing a girl who some witnesses say had
a role in the incident but has not been charged. "If it had happened
in South-Central Los Angeles, nobody would be looking for a greater
meaning."</TE>
<TE>   The fallout from the party continues. This month, Sarkissian's
younger half-sister, whose scuffle with Maran triggered the fight,
was charged with one count of battery and one count of making a
criminal threat. The battery charge relates to an allegation that she
kicked Maran, said Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles
County district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   The other charge involves a threat made on the Internet months
after the party. The girl, who is 15, is to be arraigned Friday. As
for Katrina Sarkissian, Deb Hof, a dean at a private school in Palo
Alto, recalls a different girl from the one who has been vilified but
whose death, she said, is also tragic.</TE>
<TE>   "She was bright; she was a wonderful kid who had a lot going on in
her life," said Hof, who was a dean at Harvard-Westlake, where
Sarkissian attended seventh and eighth grades. "I know she was
struggling and unhappy, [but] there was a lot to like about her."</TE>
<TE>   Sarkissian, Hof recalled, "looked like a woman at 13 [and] got
constant attention from every male on the planet." Her father and
mother were divorced, and her mother, Angelique, married
ophthalmologist Matthew Bernstein, with whom she had another
daughter. The Bernsteins later divorced as well.</TE>
<TE>   In middle school, Sarkissian was a textbook case of a girl who
needed adults to guide her and set boundaries, Hof said.</TE>
<TE>   "Katrina was trying to figure out where she fit in," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Hof recalled that Sarkissian struggled during ninth grade at
Harvard-Westlake, one of the region's most rigorous private schools.
"I think her academic light was extinguished by worries about boys,
friends and her universe," Hof said.</TE>
<TE>   "Katrina just wasn't a kid to back down, and then she would be in
tears because nobody liked her," Hof said. She withdrew from the
school in early 1999 (although her death certificate inexplicably
lists her "profession" as student and her "employer" as
Harvard-Westlake) to seek a "smaller, more structured school."</TE>
<TE>   At some point, according to her stepfather, Sarkissian landed at
Concord High School in Santa Monica. She left that private school as
well and, he said, was home-schooled for the last eight months of her
life.</TE>
<TE>   Bernstein's chief concern now, he said, is his 15-year-old
daughter. She has received 20 death threats, he said, some of which
have come to his office. Rattled by the calls, one of his employees
quit.</TE>
<TE>   Of Maran, he said: "She might have been a great kid, but that
night she acted very unwisely and aggressively. As a result,
Katrina's dead and [my daughter] is still not out of the woods."</TE>
<TE>   Here is Natale's account--corroborated by other witnesses--of the
incident:</TE>
<TE>   Sarkissian's half-sister was horsing around, chasing one of
Natale's friends around the backyard. They repeatedly upset a flower
pot.</TE>
<TE>   Maran, known for being fearless, grabbed the girl by the
shoulders, telling her to stop. "I don't recall the exact words,"
Natale said, "but she said something like, 'Show respect for someone
else's house.'" The other girl told Maran not to touch her; they
pushed each other and then began fighting.</TE>
<TE>   The other girl was thrown off a short ledge and landed in a flower
bed, still holding Maran's hair. Some boys broke up the tussle. Maran
began shouting "Samo! Samo!"--a nickname for Santa Monica High. It
was clear that the other girl, not a Santa Monica High student, was
humiliated. "She was dirty but not hurt. Her pride was hurt," Natale
said.</TE>
<TE>   Then, Natale said, he overheard the girl on her cell phone:
"Katrina, you've got to get here right now. Some bitch just pushed me
down."</TE>
<TE>   About an hour later, as Maran was trying to find a ride home,
Natale said, Sarkissian pulled up in a white sport utility vehicle
and asked, "Who pushed my sister?" Maran raised her hand.</TE>
<TE>   The girls argued for about five minutes and then, Natale recalled,
Sarkissian rushed Maran, and the two pushed each other. One or two
punches were thrown.</TE>
<TE>   Sarkissian quickly ran away, and Maran stumbled backward. Another
girl, he said, came in and grabbed Maran, pushing her to the ground
and holding her down.</TE>
<TE>   After a few seconds, that girl backed off. Sarkissian's
half-sister came up and kicked Maran's midsection. By that time,
Natale said, some kids were yelling "Fight! Fight! Hit her already."</TE>
<TE>   "No one even knew what happened," he said. "Not a single witness
saw a blade at any time."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, no weapon was ever recovered. Authorities concluded that
the weapon was a "punch knife," in which the blade pops out between
the user's fingers.</TE>
<TE>   Maran, wearing a dark blue sweatshirt and jeans, got up, stumbled
and leaned against a tree, staring off into space. Natale, who at the
time had a cast on his right wrist, tried to pick her up but "she was
completely lifeless." He then saw that his cast "was completely
stained with blood."</TE>
<TE>   At that moment, he said, everybody panicked. When another student
pulled up in his car to join the party, several kids piled Maran into
the back seat. They sped off for Santa Monica Hospital, apparently
unaware that UCLA Medical Center was blocks away.</TE>
<TE>   Natale heard later that one boy in the car had his hand on Maran's
chest and felt her heart stop beating. She was declared dead just
after midnight.</TE>
<TE>   What, her friends have wondered since, can be learned from such a
tragedy?</TE>
<TE>   James Yoo, 15, who attended the party, said it taught him to be
less eager to lash out at people who annoy him. "I'm just more
cautious about fights," he said. "I just let things go."</TE>
<TE>   For Lee Livingston, whose son Tim rode the bus with Maran to the
party and then watched as she was mortally wounded, it has reminded
him that parents need to set and enforce rules. But parenting
teenagers, he said, involves leaps of faith.</TE>
<TE>   "You pray to God they're telling you the truth," he said. "We have
reiterated the rules. We keep bringing it up and telling him, 'You've
got to let us know where you are.'"</TE>
<TE>   If this has been a grim lesson in growing up, Maran's death has
also shown teenagers that it's possible to simultaneously mourn and
celebrate a life. Witness the empty chair in the alto section of the
Samohi Chorale.</TE>
<TE>   Maran's voice is no longer raised in song, but her picture hangs
on the choral room bulletin board. In March, two choirs dedicated
their performance of the Mozart Requiem to her. She had struggled
with some of the passages, said choral director Christopher Rhodes,
but she was "always very much the cheerleader, saying 'Don't give
up.'"</TE>
<TE>   At the birthday gathering, partygoers admired the shrine that
Maran's mother, Harriet, maintains in front of the house, with its
crown of large plastic sunflowers. Not long ago, that shrine drew a
visitor, Julie Freitas, who three years ago also lost a child when
her son was murdered.</TE>
<TE>   She has since become a friend, visiting once a week with muffins
and conversation, seeking to help the Marans along a "long and pretty
unbearable journey of grief."</TE>
<TE>   The party at the Maran home helped too. It was good, somehow, to
see so many of Deanna's friends--hugging, laughing and, of course,
weeping.</TE>

<CX>   Concord High--A story in Tuesday's California section implied that
Katrina Sarkissian, who fatally stabbed a 15-year-old girl last fall, was
once a full-time student at Concord High School in Santa Monica.
Sarkissian, 17, took two summer courses at Concord in 1999 but was never
a regular student. Such students must pass an interview for admittance
and their academic records are scrutinized, according to Susan Packer
Davis, Concord's administrator.</CX>

<HD>Union Wins a Role in Reform of LAPD</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Police Protective League has the right to formally
participate in implementation of the federal consent decree aimed at
reforming the Los Angeles Police Department, a federal appeals court
ruled Monday.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals strongly
suggested that several community activist groups, represented by the
American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, should also be
able to participate in the process.</LD>
<LD>   The 3-0 decision granting the Protective League formal status in
the consent decree process overturns a ruling last year by U.S.
District Judge Gary A. Feess, who is supervising the decree.</LD>
<TE>   Monday's decision was a major victory for the league, which also
had been spurned in its efforts to be part of the negotiations that
led to the consent decree. The decision, however, was viewed with
apprehension by some, including Mayor James K. Hahn, who say they
fear the league will attempt to obstruct reforms.</TE>
<TE>   "I am thrilled," said Costa Mesa lawyer Gregory G. Petersen, who
represents the league. He said the 9th Circuit order would give the
league the right to appear as a party in court, raise objections on
how the decree is being implemented and to file appeals if it does
not prevail on various issues.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said he would ask the city attorney's office to ask for a
rehearing before a larger panel of 9th Circuit judges. He expressed
concern that if the league became a formal party in the case it could
hamper the reform process.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we can allow the Police Protective League to be an
obstacle to police reform," Hahn said. "If we are going to be subject
to some kind of pressure by the police union to undo the path we are
on to reform, I think that's the wrong thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   Both the city and the U.S. Justice Department had opposed
intervention by the league and the community groups.</TE>
<TE>   In his decision last year, Feess acknowledged that the league,
which represents nearly 9,000 rank and file officers, "has an
important perspective on this action." But he said permitting the
league formal status in the case would slow the process of reform.</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit disagreed, saying Feess' praiseworthy management
of the case so far shows that he can handle it in a fair and
expedient fashion even with the addition of other parties.</TE>
<TE>   "More importantly," wrote Judge Sidney R. Thomas, "the idea of
'streamlining' the litigation," as urged by city officials and the
Justice Department, "should not be accomplished at the risk of
marginalizing those--such as the Police League and the Community
Intervenors--who have some of the strongest interests in the
outcome."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the appellate panel, which also included Judges
James R. Browning and Johnnie B. Rawlinson, awarded one major victory
to the city and the Justice Department. The judges said even though
Monday's decision involves rulings made at the onset of the case,
"our holding does not require the district court to turn back the
clock or rescind the consent decree," which the Protective League had
sought.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, the appeals court said the league will have formal status
in the case as soon as Feess issues a formal intervention order when
the case is returned to him.</TE>
<TE>   The decree, a response to the Rampart scandal, is designed to end
what the Justice Department has termed "a pattern or practice" of
civil rights violations by the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department spokesman Dan Nelson said, "We are pleased that
the consent decree remains in place and that reforms will continue.
We are looking forward to the union's input into the process."</TE>
<TE>   However, other sources said some in the department are quite
disturbed about the ruling, which could alter the dynamics of the
reform process.</TE>
<TE>   The league already has made it clear that it strongly objects to
one major requirement of the decree--having to collect data on the
race and ethnicity of each motorist an officer stops. The data
collection is required under the decree, as a means of helping to
determine whether LAPD officers are engaging in "racial profiling."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, though, Petersen said the league considered it an act
of racial profiling for the officers to gather the data.</TE>
<TE>   ACLU legal director Mark D. Rosenbaum called Monday's
ruling--which suggests that Feess should grant the community groups
and 12 Los Angeles residents what is known as "permissive intervenor"
status in the case--"a great victory."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles residents, he said, "are the ultimate stakeholders in
terms of the integrity of the consent decree" and need to have an
opportunity to work with the city and independent monitor Michael
Cherkasky in implementing the decree.</TE>
<TE>   The groups are the Southern Christian Leadership Conference of Los
Angeles, Homeboy's, the Asian Pacific American Legal Center and Radio
Sin Fronteras.</TE>
<TE>   "The individuals," the court said, "are people of color, many of
whom live in areas ... that have high crime rates, who have submitted
uncontroverted declarations stating that they have suffered from, and
are likely to continue to suffer from, the unconstitutional police
misconduct that forms the basis of the United States' suit against"
the defendants. The defendants include the city of Los Angeles, the
LAPD and the Police Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the appeals court said Feess was correct in denying
the individuals and community groups what is called mandatory
intervenor status in the case. The court said the individuals and
groups had not shown that the government was not adequately
protecting their interests.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the 9th Circuit said the Protective League
clearly was entitled to mandatory intervenor status because its labor
contract with the city could be affected by the implementation of the
consent decree. The appeals court said no other party in the case
could adequately protect the league's interests. It rejected Feess'
position that granting the league friend-of-the court status was
sufficient to protect its interests, because such a position does not
give the league any right to appeal decisions involving the decree.</TE>

<HD>El Toro Housing on O.C. Board's Agenda</HD>
<DH>Land use: Supervisor Chuck Smith will ask that vacant
military homes be sold as affordable units and for transitional use.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County Supervisor Chuck Smith will ask his colleagues today to
consider selling more than 850 vacant military homes on the closed El
Toro Marine base as transitional living and affordable housing.</LD>
<LD>   The request will come on the same day as an expected announcement
by the U.S. Navy regarding the base's future and one week after the
Board of Supervisors voted to allow Irvine to annex the 4,700-acre
base.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman from Smith's office did not know if the supervisor--a
longtime supporter of a commercial airport at the former base--has
enough votes for approval. The proposal could add a wrinkle to
Irvine's bid to take over the base from the Navy and implement its
plans for the site.</LD>
<TE>   "My thoughts are that we are very close to solving what has been
tearing up Orange County for years," said Irvine Councilman Mike
Ward.</TE>
<TE>   "Please, give Irvine a shot," he said. "It sounds like the board
is trying to put another roadblock up here."</TE>
<TE>   Smith said he is adamant that the Navy understands, regardless of
its decision on the base, that the county needs affordable housing
for low-income people and transitional housing for the homeless and
young adults leaving foster care.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess you can say I don't have any warm feelings that Irvine is
going to go for an affordable housing and transitional living plan
for El Toro," Smith said. "I want to at least have the Navy know what
we want."</TE>
<TE>   Under Smith's proposal, county staff would be directed to begin
discussions with the Navy and the Department of Housing and Urban
Development over the sale of 852 housing units north of Irvine
Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Smith wants the county to find a way to make interim and long-term
housing programs at El Toro compatible with Measure W, the
voter-approved initiative that killed the possibility of a commercial
airport there.</TE>
<TE>   The area includes a 273-acre housing tract with two-, three- and
four-bedroom homes formerly occupied by Marine officers.</TE>
<TE>   In his memo, Smith said he would like to see a speedy decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe the board has done a considerable amount of talking and
jawboning about low-income and affordable housing," Smith wrote. "It
is time for the board to take action."</TE>
<TE>   Irvine has proposed putting faculty housing in the same area for
Cal State Fullerton and UC Irvine, which would add affordable housing
to their plan, city officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Councilman Chris Mears said the timing of the supervisor's
idea seemed a bit odd given that the board approved the city's plan
last week.</TE>
<TE>   Mears noted that Smith was part of the board's three-member
pro-airport majority that had delayed the base housing idea because
of fears that if people moved onto the base, they would vote to be
annexed to Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   In the city's plan, 165 housing units are already designated as
transitional and affordable, Mears said. "We're going to honor that
and to that extent we're sympathetic with what Supervisor Smith is
[saying]."</TE>
<TE>   But Mears added that until the Navy announces its decision on the
disposal of El Toro, such talk "is only conversation."</TE>
<TE>   Board Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad, who was the swing vote for last
week's annexation approval, said she needs answers to her many
questions about Smith's plan before she could endorse it.</TE>

airport there.</TE>
<TE>   The area includes a 273-acre housing tract with two-, three- and
four-bedroom homes formerly occupied by Marine officers.</TE>
<TE>   In his memo, Smith said he would like to see a speedy decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe the board has done a considerable amount of talking and
jawboning about low-income and affordable housing," Smith wrote. "It
is time for the board to take action."</TE>
<TE>   Irvine has proposed putting faculty housing in the same area for
Cal State Fullerton and UC Irvine, which would add affordable housing
to their plan, city officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Councilman Chris Mears said the timing of the supervisor's
idea seemed a bit odd given that the board approved the city's plan
last week.</TE>
<TE>   Mears noted that Smith was part of the board's three-member
pro-airport majority that had delayed the base housing idea because
of fears that if people moved onto the base, they would vote to be
annexed to Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   In the city's plan, 165 housing units are already designated as
transitional and affordable, Mears said. "We're going to honor that
and to that extent we're sympathetic with what Supervisor Smith is
[saying]."</TE>
<TE>   But Mears added that until the Navy announces its decision on the
disposal of El Toro, such talk "is only conversation."</TE>
<TE>   "Until the Navy tells us what it wants to do with the [former]
base, we don't know what's going to happen," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Board Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad, who was the swing vote for last
week's annexation approval, said she needs answers to her many
questions about Smith's plan before she could endorse it.</TE>
<TE>   In the past month, Smith and Supervisor Tom Wilson have visited
former military bases in California that have initiated affordable
housing programs.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson does not want to ruin Irvine's chances for annexation. But
he may vote to have Irvine and the county work together on a plan to
resolve how to convert military housing into civilian use, Wilson's
spokeswoman said.</TE>

<HD>3 City Officials Cleared of Violating Brown Act</HD>
<DH>Thousand Oaks: D.A. finds no evidence they broke law in
conferring about land-swap deal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thousand Oaks Councilwoman Linda Parks and two former planning
commissioners did not violate the state's open-meeting law when they
conferred about a controversial land-swap deal with developers, the
district attorney has concluded.</LD>
<LD>   City Council members who accused Parks and Commissioners Michael
Farris and Nora Aidukas of violating the state's Brown Act lacked any
evidence to support their claims, Special Assistant Dist. Atty. R.
Thomas Harris wrote in a report dated April 15 and released Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Nor was there any evidence to support allegations that Farris and
Aidukas conspired with a third commissioner, Claudia Bill-de la Pena,
to delay a vote on the plan to preserve nearly 200 acres in an area
known as the Western Plateau, Harris wrote.</LD>
<TE>   To the contrary, planning commissioners wanted to "conscientiously
read and consider" the details of the land deal, "rather than to be
stampeded into making a hasty approval or disapproval recommendation
to the council," Harris concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Farris and Aidukas, who were ousted by a majority of the council
members because of the controversy, said Harris' report vindicates
their actions.</TE>
<TE>   Farris, who plans to run for the council and is suing the city
over an aspect of the development deal in question, said the
prosecutor's report "closes the door on this and puts the blame
squarely on the City Council majority."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Dan Del Campo, who joined Councilmen Andy Fox and
Dennis Gillette in pushing for the investigation, said he was
disappointed with the results. The district attorney's office "just
kind of touched the surface on this" and failed to consider other
evidence, the councilman said. But he declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   In February, the council voted 3 to 2 to censure Parks, oust
Farris and Aidukas and call for an investigation after the planning
board delayed a recommendation on the land deal.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan, a 191-acre swath of the Western Plateau would be
preserved as open space. In exchange for the land, the developers
could build more expensive housing in place of 225 senior and
affordable units in the Dos Vientos area.</TE>
<TE>   The deal put Parks, who was a candidate for county supervisor at
the time, in a difficult position, her critics said. If she voted for
the deal, she might be accused of assisting developers, and if she
opposed the plan, it could hurt her reputation as a protector of open
space, they said.</TE>
<TE>   The council majority had argued that Farris, Aidukas and Bill-de
la Pena seemed to act in an orchestrated fashion when they said they
needed more time to consider the deal. The council never asked for an
investigation of Bill-de la Pena.</TE>
<TE>   The councilmen argued that Farris and Aidukas were stalling so
that Parks and the rest of the council would not have to vote on the
measure until after the March 5 election. Parks, who acknowledged
that she met individually with commissioners to discuss the Western
Plateau deal, was elected to the county Board of Supervisors. She
takes office in January.</TE>
<TE>   After making some technical changes to the development deal, the
City Council unanimously approved the plan Feb. 27.</TE>

<HD>Chino Hills Fire Burns 860 Acres</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A fire charred more than 860 acres in Chino Hills State Park and
threatened homes in east Yorba Linda before it was fully contained
Monday evening, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Fire officials and Brea police briefly held two 15-year-old boys
suspected of starting the fire with illegal fireworks.</LD>
<LD>   The youths were part of a group of boys seen in the area,
authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   The two were released to their parents, fire officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze started about 5 p.m. Sunday near a steep ridge along
Evening Breeze Drive, which is next to open land on Orange County's
eastern border, fire officials said. The flames moved quickly up the
ridge and came within 20 yards of backyard fences.</TE>
<TE>   Anxious neighbors spent Sunday afternoon wetting down lawns and
shrubbery while eyeing the hillside, where 20-foot flames shot into
the air.</TE>
<TE>   Strong winds eventually pushed flames east into the state park in
San Bernardino County.</TE>
<TE>   There were no structures within the park. By Monday afternoon, the
blaze was 70% contained, Orange County Fire Authority spokeswoman
Lisa Oborny said.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Stephen Miller of the Fire Authority, said, "The winds were
calmer today. We didn't have intense heat either, and that helped.''</TE>
<TE>   The fire is expected to be fully controlled by 6 p.m. today,
Oborny said.</TE>
<TE>   At its peak late Sunday, nearly 500 firefighters from several
agencies fought the fire. More than 200 continued to battle it
Monday, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   An airplane and two helicopters dropped fire retardant and water.</TE>

<HD>Gardeners Grow Upset Over Loss of School Site</HD>
<DH>Finances: Facing a budget crunch, the district plans to
sell land that is used for community gardens.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN MERL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tom Conyers studies the robust tangle of leafy brambles climbing
their supports in his small garden plot, their white flowers starting
to give way to tiny green berries.</LD>
<LD>   He does a quick calculation with his practiced gardener's eye.
Forty-five days, he estimates, and he'll have the first crop from the
two small bare-root canes he planted last spring.</LD>
<LD>   "If we last that long," he said.</LD>
<TE>   For more than 25 years, the Manhattan Beach Unified School
District has played host to gardeners at 80 plots carved from an
unused strip of land next to the athletic fields at the edge of Mira
Costa High School. At the Manhattan Beach Community Garden (open to
all ages) and the adjacent Pea Patch, reserved for people over 55,
friendships have grown along with the poppies and sweet peas, the
broccoli and lettuce.</TE>
<TE>   Now the school district is facing budget problems and has decided
to sell the land. District officials believe the narrow garden site,
covering less than an acre, will fetch about $1.6 million as lots for
three houses.</TE>
<TE>   The gardeners must be out by May 31, the district announced, in a
Feb. 22 letter to the organization's president and in eviction
notices on the gardens' chain-link fence.</TE>
<TE>   "We're grateful for the time we've had here, but we were hoping we
would be given more notice so we could have a chance to raise the
money to buy the land or at least to find another place," said Ann
Barklow, a community gardener and maintenance director of the
Manhattan Beach Botanical Garden, which also sits on school district
land.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm witnessing what this has done to our seniors, and they are
just at such a low now. This has taken away so much from them, and I
just wish there was some way we could work with the school district
and find a balance between the needs of the students and the needs of
the seniors," Barklow said.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Smith, deputy superintendent of business for the school
district, called the gardens "a worthwhile cause," but said the
district's top priority is serving its 6,000 students.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really a choice of utilizing our assets to prevent program
and budget cuts that affect our own kids versus having a nice area
for the seniors to garden in," he said. "We understand that they like
it, but our kids have to come first."</TE>
<TE>   Smith said the district does not yet have a buyer, although it has
had inquiries from developers. He said the district turned down the
gardeners' request for a deadline extension because it needs time to
"get in there and make it more marketable" by clearing the gardens.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd be tickled to death if they could find a guardian angel or a
philanthropy group" that could buy the land, Smith said. "Our goal is
not to stop the gardens; it's to increase funding for our students."</TE>
<TE>   Noting that the state, which provides most of the funding for
public schools, has recently made cuts in public education, Smith
said the request for an extension as long as two years is not
feasible.</TE>
<TE>   The gardeners, many of whom spent a year or more on a waiting list
for plots, are scrambling as eviction looms. They have been unable to
find land elsewhere in the heavily developed and increasingly
expensive beach communities, where most have lived for many years.</TE>
<TE>   They are appealing for help from the Manhattan Beach City Council,
their state and county elected officials and charitable
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   They have touted their ideas not only for continuing gardening
lessons and tours but also for expanding the gardens' reach and
benefits. Those ideas include raising vegetables for the needy and
installing raised beds to accommodate those in wheelchairs.</TE>
<TE>   Barklow's letter to the Beach Cities Health District, which funds
numerous health and wellness programs in Hermosa Beach, Manhattan
Beach and Redondo Beach, caught the attention of health district
board member Joanne Woodward, who invited the gardeners to make their
pitch at last week's board meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate to see all the good work they have been doing go to
waste," said Woodward. "I don't know if we can do anything to help
them, but I would sure like to try."</TE>
<TE>   But the gardeners know they face long odds, and some have been
reluctant to plant spring crops. A few plots have been allowed to
wither, the last of the winter vegetables giving way to weeds. Others
soldier on, feeding and watering their artichokes, spinach and string
beans and debating whether they should plant tomatoes.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Webb, a commercial beekeeper who grows kohlrabi and other
crops in his plot, minces no words about the looming eviction.</TE>
<TE>   "I am more than angry," Webb said, working the garden as the sun
burned through the morning fog.</TE>
<TE>   "The seniors have been giving to the community and the schools
over the years, and we deserve to have something given back. All we
hear is 'the kids, the kids.' Seniors matter, too," Webb said.</TE>
<TE>   Retiree Rudy Weaver credits his gardening with helping him keep
healthy and active. He took a long look at the plots bursting with
flowers and vegetables, at the miniature windmills installed to scare
off gophers, at his fellow gardeners watering and digging.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we're going to save this place," Weaver said
slowly, "but I sure hope we do."</TE>

<HD>Murder Case Is Declared a Mistrial</HD>
<DH>Court: New evidence forces attorney to drop his defense of
Richard Geise, accused of killing a Ventura market clerk.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A mistrial was declared Monday in the murder case against Richard
John Geise, one of two men accused of shooting a clerk during a
robbery of Ventura's Central Market last April.</LD>
<LD>   On a day scheduled for closing arguments, defense attorney Willard
Wiksell said he had been given new evidence Friday and would no
longer be ethically able to represent Geise.</LD>
<LD>   Wiksell, who met with prosecutors and Ventura County Superior
Court Judge Roland Purnell for more than three hours behind closed
doors Monday, would not elaborate on the nature of the evidence.</LD>
<TE>   "It put me in an impossible situation and I could no longer go
forward," he said later. After viewing the evidence, the judge agreed
and discharged the jury. A new trial date was set for July 22.</TE>
<TE>   Geise, 32, of Ojai could face the death penalty if convicted of
the fatal shooting at the family-owned market.</TE>
<TE>   Police said two men wearing gas masks entered the market on
Ventura Avenue about 1 p.m. on April 6 of last year and ordered the
clerks to open the safe.</TE>
<TE>   Before the employees could comply, the suspects opened fire,
police said. Primitivo Alejandro Alvarez, 35, was killed and brothers
Balbir and Mohan Singh were injured.</TE>
<TE>   The other suspected gunman, Alfonso Acosta Delgado Jr., 25, was
killed in May by a Ventura police SWAT team marksman after a
five-hour standoff outside his grandmother's house.</TE>
<TE>   Geise, who has been on trial for about a week, testified Wednesday
that he was two miles from the crime scene with his family at the
time of the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   He testified that a few hours after the shooting, his cousin,
Alfonso Delgado, and Sam Patterson visited him at a motel on Seaward
Avenue in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Geise said the men wanted him to help them make false
identification cards, which he did. Geise testified that the men then
told him they had robbed Central Market earlier in the day.</TE>
<TE>   Both men are now dead--Patterson from a drug overdose.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors called Geise a habitual liar who earlier told police
he had gone to Magic Mountain with his family the day of the robbery.</TE>
<TE>   Police reported finding drugs and a computer used to make fake
identification cards in Geise's motel room when he was arrested. A
.40-caliber semiautomatic handgun was found hidden in the ceiling
above a closet. Lab tests revealed the gun was one of two weapons
fired during the shooting, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Wiksell said his private investigator had been given the new
evidence from an unidentified person. The evidence made it
impossible, both legally and ethically, to try the case, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We were ready to argue the case to the jury. We felt we had a
strong defense," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Don Glynn, who is prosecuting the case,
called Wiksell a fine attorney who was doing the right thing by
bowing out.</TE>
<TE>   The court will appoint another attorney for Geise next week and a
new jury will be selected in the coming weeks.</TE>

<HD>Justices OK Local Ban on Gun Shows</HD>
<DH>Arms: State high court rules cities and counties can have
tougher laws than California's for their property, such as L.A.
fairgrounds. Other prohibitions expected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California cities and counties have the right to ban guns or gun
sales on fairgrounds and other public property, the California
Supreme Court decided Monday.</LD>
<LD>   In a pair of 6-1 rulings involving Los Angeles and Alameda
counties, the state high court found that state gun laws do not
prohibit cities and counties from passing tougher local laws to
restrict gun shows on their property. Gun shows are held throughout
California on county fairgrounds virtually every weekend of the year.</LD>
<LD>   The decisions are expected to spark many more bans around the
state, lawyers on both sides of the cases said. Some counties already
have passed resolutions of intent to prohibit gun sales if such bans
were found to be permissible under state law. In Los Angeles County,
the decision will lead to removal of an injunction that prevented it
from enforcing its 1999 ban.</LD>
<TE>   The state high court said that state law does not require counties
to make their property available to gun shows and concluded that Los
Angeles County can prohibit the sale of guns and ammunition on its
fairgrounds in Pomona even though Pomona is an incorporated city with
laws of its own.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, author of the
county's gun law, said the ruling was "a very big deal" for the
county because gun shows on the fairgrounds were a "veritable bazaar
for all kinds of weapons, legal and illegal."</TE>
<TE>   "This is the venue of choice for people who want to traffic in
guns, who don't want to be held accountable, who don't want to be
known," the supervisor said. "This is the great beyond where gun
traffickers go to buy weapons they don't want to be traced or enter
into deals for weapons that are illegal in the United States."</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court said the county has the right to prohibit sales
at shows held by Great Western Shows Inc., which operated three gun
and collector shows a year at the fairgrounds until 1999. The shows,
some of the biggest in the nation, were held there for 22 years.
Great Western, which later relocated its shows to Las Vegas, sued Los
Angeles County to end the ban.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Carlos R. Moreno, writing for the court, said "grave
problems" prompted Los Angeles to approve the sweeping prohibition.
He noted that there had been "significant illegal gun trafficking" at
shows on the fairgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   The court also ruled in favor of Alameda County's ban on
possession of guns and ammunition on its property. Alameda County
outlawed gun possession after eight people were wounded in gunfire at
its fairgrounds in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Gun promoters had challenged both county laws in separate cases in
federal court. In the Los Angeles case, a federal district judge
refused to allow the county to enforce its gun ordinance on the
grounds that it was preempted by state law.</TE>
<TE>   The legal challenges then went to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals, which asked the state Supreme Court to determine whether
such ordinances are permissible under state law. The cases will now
return to federal court, where in the Los Angeles case the court will
remove the lower court order blocking the ban, a county lawyer said.
Gun proponents say they will then argue that the laws violate 1st
Amendment rights to assembly and other constitutional protections.</TE>
<TE>   The two decisions Monday removed what many believed was the
biggest hurdle to such laws. Other appellate courts in California
have disagreed over whether such ordinances are preempted by the
state.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we are on solid ground on every other issue," said
Lawrence L. Hafetz, senior deputy Los Angeles County counsel. He said
the county has a "strong case" on the 1st Amendment challenge.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles case will probably go to trial within six months,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Both Counties Allow Shows About Guns</TE>
<TE>   Neither Los Angeles nor Alameda county prohibits all shows about
guns. Alameda County Counsel Richard Winnie said gun sellers could
still gather on county property to show videos of guns and hand out
leaflets.</TE>
<TE>   "Our ordinance merely bans the possession of guns on county
property," Winnie said. "If that has an incidental dampening effect
on gun shows, that is up to them."</TE>
<TE>   But Donald E.J. Kilmer Jr., who represented a gun show promoter in
the Alameda County case, said he was optimistic that federal courts
will determine that the laws prohibit "people from assembling and
discussing and trading ideas and merchandise and thoughts about
firearms."</TE>
<TE>   "It is an attempt to ban gun shows," Kilmer said. "Gun culture
does exist, and [people] do have a right to express their views."</TE>
<TE>   He said gun shows are highly regulated traditions at county fairs.
"What is new is people trying to scapegoat law-abiding gun owners for
the crimes other people commit with guns," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Moreno, writing his first major majority opinions since
his appointment to the high court last year, cited statistics that
1,385 people were killed by firearms in 1997 in Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   "The costs and benefits of making firearms more available through
gun shows to the populace of a heavily urban county such as Los
Angeles may well be different than in rural counties, where violent
gun-related crime may not be as prevalent," Moreno wrote in Great
Western Shows vs. County of Los Angeles, S091547.</TE>
<TE>   The court said the ban was legal even though the fairgrounds are
in Pomona, an incorporated city, because the county ordinance did not
conflict with Pomona's laws.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Janice Rogers Brown dissented, arguing that Los Angeles
County was attempting to regulate the affairs of Pomona. "When the
Legislature creates an incorporated city, it delegates that
regulatory authority to the city, taking it away from the county,"
Brown wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County supervisors voted 3 to 2 to enact the ban two
weeks after a white supremacist went on a shooting rampage that left
a postal worker dead and five people seriously wounded at a San
Fernando Valley Jewish community center.</TE>
<TE>   No gun shows have been held on the county fairgrounds since 1999,
when Great Western relocated to Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   In Alameda County, the fairgrounds are on unincorporated county
land in the city of Pleasanton. Exhibitors at gun shows there
included sellers of antique firearms and Old West memorabilia.</TE>
<TE>   Moreno wrote that the effect of Alameda County's 1999 ordinance
makes gun shows at the fairgrounds "virtually impossible." "But as we
held in Great Western, such a total ban is within the scope of a
county's authority," Moreno wrote in Nordyke vs. Mary V. King,
S091549.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Brown again dissented, arguing that Alameda County's
prohibition on the possession of firearms conflicts with several
state laws that authorize certain people to carry firearms without
restriction.</TE>
<TE>   "The small and superficially benign acts of a democratic
government can erode personal freedom just as surely, and to the same
end, as the large and malignant acts of a tyrant or dictator," she
wrote.</TE>

<HD>Davis Backs $2.1-Billion Bond to Aid the Homeless</HD>
<DH>Legislation: In a highly choreographed event, governor
signs bill to place largest-ever subsidized housing measure on
ballot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis promised a major commitment to end homelessness at an
event Monday that took on the air of a rally for both the governor's
reelection and for a $2.1-billion housing bond on the November
ballot.</LD>
<LD>   While cautioning several times that there are no quick solutions
to the problem, Davis also raised the visibility of the issue by
presiding over a four-hour "Governor's Summit on Homelessness" and
heralding the creation of a task force headed by some of his top
aides.</LD>
<LD>   Davis used the occasion to sign legislation placing the housing
bond on the November ballot. The $2.1-billion bond measure, the
largest ever proposed in California for subsidized housing, is
intended to help provide homes for low- and moderate-income people.</LD>
<TE>   "Californians can no longer afford to avert their eyes," the
Democratic governor told state and local officials, homeless and
housing advocates and representatives of the real estate and building
industries, who filled an auditorium at a downtown Sacramento Boys &amp;
Girls Club.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no silver bullets ... but we can make a difference,"
Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   A series of speakers described the scope of the problem--360,000
Californians, many of them mentally ill, are without shelter on any
given day--and said better coordinated social services are needed to
help them.</TE>
<TE>   Several cited the need for additional temporary housing for people
who are in the process of getting off the streets.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco Supervisor Gavin Newsom, who has attracted attention
in Northern California for his efforts to solve the homelessness
problem in his city, lauded Davis for taking a "political risk" by
discussing the issue, adding, "It's incumbent upon us to leverage the
governor and hold him accountable."</TE>
<TE>   Newsom noted that in 2000, at least 183 homeless people died in
the streets of San Francisco. But he added that efforts to end
homelessness are not simply a social cause. Tourists to San Francisco
often cite aggressive panhandling as their top complaint.</TE>
<TE>   "The No. 1 complaint of tourists is homelessness; there is a huge
cost," Newsom said.</TE>
<TE>   The event provided a backdrop for what may have been Davis' most
elaborate bill-signing ceremony ever.</TE>
<TE>   The governor, who faces reelection in November, was seated behind
a huge panel adorned with children's artwork. A gospel choir provided
musical interludes. The event was to be aired on Davis' Web page.</TE>
<TE>   The bill-signing itself was beamed by satellite for use by
television stations that sent no reporters.</TE>
<TE>   One speaker at the taxpayer-funded event, Carl Guardino, director
of the Silicon Valley Manufacturers Group, urged that participants
contribute to the housing bond campaign, saying that the effort will
"cost millions." As a start, Guardino told the audience he would be
writing a check for $1,000.</TE>
<TE>   Several speakers praised Davis, most notably for signing
legislation in 1999 and 2000 earmarking $55 million to encourage
mentally ill homeless people to move into housing and provide them
services.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Contreras-Sweet, Davis' secretary for business,
transportation and housing, lauded the governor for having "the
wisdom and foresight" to convene the summit and assign cabinet
members to work on the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Several advocates for the homeless praised Davis' decision to hold
the summit, but questioned the timing, near the end of his first
term. The issue has been attracting increased media attention
recently.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever it takes," said Ruth Swartz, director of Shelter
Partnership Inc. in Los Angeles. "It's a great time to reach out to
the base--people who care about social issues."</TE>
<TE>   Charles "Bud" Hayes of the Single Room Occupancy Housing Corp. in
Los Angeles called the summit "excellent" and said speakers "touched
every base."</TE>
<TE>   "We've known for over 10 years every single problem and solution,"
Hayes said, adding that the timing of the bill-signing added to "a
high level of cynicism and low level of trust that government will
follow through."</TE>

<HD>3 Arrested on Suspicion of Kidnap for Ransom</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two men and a woman were arrested early Monday by Los Angeles police
on suspicion of kidnapping for ransom, robbery and carjacking in the
alleged attack against two men Sunday evening at an El Sereno park.</LD>
<LD>   Police spokesman John Pasquariello identified those who were
arrested as Manuel Perry, 28, of Azusa; Richard Gomez, 28, of San
Bernardino; and Reanita Bell, 20, of Highland Park. Those allegedly
abducted were not identified.</LD>
<LD>   Pasquariello said the victims were seated in a pickup truck when
they were seized along with their truck.</LD>
<TE>   Later, he said, one of the kidnappers called a friend of one of
the victims and demanded an undisclosed amount of money for their
release. A relative of the victim notified police, who arranged a
money drop.</TE>
<TE>   But in the meantime, Pasquariello said, the alleged perpetrators
got uneasy and let the victims go unharmed.</TE>
<TE>   Further investigation led to the surrounding of the men in a
Highland Park apartment, the evacuation of the apartment building and
then the arrest of the suspects, the police spokesman said.</TE>

<HD>Linda Boreman, 53; Star of 'Deep Throat' Became Advocate
Against Porn</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>DENVER -- Linda Boreman, who starred as Linda Lovelace in the 1972
pornographic film "Deep Throat" and later became an anti-pornography
advocate, died Monday of injuries she suffered in a car crash early
this month. She was 53.</LD>
<LD>   Boreman was taken off life support Monday at Denver Health Medical
Center, hospital spokeswoman Sara Spaulding said. She was admitted to
the hospital April3 with massive trauma and internal injuries.</LD>
<LD>   Boreman's ex-husband, Larry Marchiano, said he and their two grown
children were at the hospital when she died.</LD>
<TE>   "Everyone might know her as something else, but we knew her as Mom
and as Linda," Marchiano said. "We divorced five years ago, but she
was still my best friend."</TE>
<TE>   The family moved to Colorado in 1990. The two divorced in 1996
after 22 years of marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Boreman said her first husband forced her into pornography at
gunpoint. They divorced in 1973.</TE>
<TE>   Their relationship disintegrated into a life of violence, rape,
prostitution and pornography, according to her 1980 autobiography,
"Ordeal," and her testimony before congressional committees
investigating pornography.</TE>
<TE>   Boreman said that she was never paid a penny for "Deep Throat" and
that her husband was paid only $1,250, although the film grossed a
reported $600 million.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving the industry, Boreman, a native of New York City,
traveled the lecture circuit on a crusade against pornography,
speaking at colleges and with prominent feminists.</TE>
<TE>   "I look in the mirror and I look the happiest I've ever looked in
my entire life," she said in a 1997 interview. "I'm not ashamed of my
past or sad about it. And what people might think of me, well, that's
not real. I look in the mirror and I know that I've survived."</TE>

<HD>Official Says He Is Victim of Smear Tactics</HD>
<DH>Personnel: A day before his job review, mental health
director says the county executive is scapegoating him for Juvenile
Hall problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Ventura County supervisors deliberate over his future, embattled
mental health Director David Gudeman says he is the victim of a smear
campaign and is being made a scapegoat for the failures of others.</LD>
<LD>   In a memo released Monday--one day before a scheduled review of
his leadership of the troubled Behavioral Health Department--Gudeman
accused County Executive Officer Johnny Johnston of orchestrating a
campaign against him to cover up civil rights abuses taking place in
Juvenile Hall.</LD>
<LD>   Gudeman says Johnston failed to act after being notified earlier
this year that a mentally disturbed youth in Juvenile Hall was kept
in seclusion without treatment, an alleged civil rights violation.
Instead of investigating the case, Johnston in recent weeks has been
making a case to fire him, Gudeman says in the memo addressed to
Johnston and County Counsel Frank Sieh.</LD>
<TE>   "I can only conclude that this has been an orchestrated attempt to
silence this issue by diverting public attention away from the true
concerns at Juvenile Hall by scapegoating me and publicly assaulting
my reputation and my stalwart commitment to patient care," Gudeman
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Papers attached to the memo indicate Johnston was notified of the
alleged incident in a Jan. 28 memo. In that memo, Gudeman does not
provide the youth's name, citing confidentiality issues. Johnston
could not be reached for comment Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Several county supervisors said Johnston repeatedly asked Gudeman
and his boss, Health Care Agency Director Pierre Durand, for more
information about the alleged violation after receiving the Jan. 28
memo but got no response.</TE>
<TE>   Probation Agency Chief Cal Remington did his own review and, by
narrowing the possibilities, recently identified the youth in
question, Supervisor Kathy Long said. An investigation into Gudeman's
claim is underway, Long said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Gudeman's charges, Long and supervisors Steve Bennett and
Judy Mikels said they do not favor delaying his performance review.</TE>
<TE>   "Professionally, he has crossed a line here," Long said. "Making
threats pertaining to civil rights violations of patients is a
serious matter. He has now put the board in an untenable position."</TE>
<TE>   Bennett also questioned Gudeman's motive.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the timing, common sense would say this is not a
coincidence," he said. "I take civil rights violations real
seriously. But this appears to be a counterattack rather than a
sincere effort to get to the bottom of any civil rights violation."</TE>
<TE>   Mikels called the memo a "diversionary smoke screen.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me this is just an attempt to deflect the
discussion," she said. "The discussion is not about the Probation
Agency. The discussion is about Behavioral Health. For this kind of
memo to start flying around at the eleventh hour is saying, 'Watch
your behind.' "</TE>
<TE>   Gudeman's memo was distributed by Supervisor Frank Schillo, the
mental health chief's strongest ally on the Board of Supervisors.
Schillo is in Washington on a lobbying trip and will not attend
today's board meeting, his office aides said.</TE>
<TE>   Schillo had requested a continuance of Gudeman's review, but with
a majority of supervisors in opposition that appears unlikely.
Johnston is scheduled to make a recommendation on Gudeman's job in
this closed-door session.</TE>
<TE>   Johnston and others have been critical of Gudeman, saying he does
not work cooperatively with other agency chiefs. Critics say he has
resisted providing needed mental health treatment for incarcerated
youths, trying to shift the cost to the Probation Agency's Remington.</TE>
<TE>   Gudeman has continually defended his department and his three-year
tenure as its leader. He blames shrinking budgets for spats between
agencies and says he has provided better care to patients than his
predecessors.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the UCLA-trained psychiatrist denied that his memo was
meant as a threat to supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no threat here," he said. "I have an affirmative duty to
do my job and to defend my reputation, and that's what I've done."</TE>
<TE>   It's not the first time that the county has been accused of
alleged violations of federal law. Four years ago, county
psychiatrist Jerome Lance filed a federal whistle-blower lawsuit
against the county, alleging its Behavioral Health Department had
submitted illegal Medicare billings.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors agreed to settle that lawsuit for $15.3 million, with
an estimated $2 million going to Lance as the whistle-blower.</TE>
<TE>   Lance, now one of Gudeman's top deputies in the Behavioral Health
Department, was coauthor of the Jan. 28 memo notifying Johnston about
the alleged civil rights violation. He could not be reached for
comment Monday.</TE>

<LD>Neighbors grew nervous when they spotted a garden hose sticking out
of the exhaust pipe of an idling car owned by a 71-year-old
Capistrano Beach man. The hose led into his backyard. Fearing someone
might be attempting suicide, they summoned authorities, the Dana
Point News reported.</LD>
<LD>   The resident answered the door and "explained that he was trying
to flush out a gopher that had invaded his property.''</LD>
<LD>   To calm his neighbors, he pulled the hose out of the gopher hole
and halted the operation.</LD>
<TE>   But it was only a temporary stay of execution. "I went back out at
3 a.m. and finished it," he told the newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   On the road: Continuing this column's series of travel tips (see
photos), I bring a reminder from Jackson Sleet of L.A. to watch out

<TE>   And from Nat Read of Pasadena comes a snapshot of a road whose
name obviously doesn't mean the same in New Zealand as it would in
the United States--unless the road has some real hairpin curves.</TE>
<TE>   And for the less adventurous: Gaye Williams of L.A. came upon a
set of Internet tips for reducing car insurance premiums, including
one radical suggestion (see accompanying).</TE>

<TE>   Got water? This year is the 40th anniversary of the opening of
Dodger Stadium, which veteran fans will recall was noteworthy for the
number of drinking fountains it housed: two, one in the Dodgers'
dugout, one in the visiting team's dugout. And fans were not welcome
to walk into either area if they got thirsty.</TE>
<TE>   Over the weekend, KCOP-TV Channel 13 replayed a 25-year-old
interview of the late Dodger owner Walter O'Malley by Vin Scully. And
O'Malley sounded unapologetic about the oversight when Scully asked
him about it.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, he seemed to confirm rumors that he had intended to
increase beer and soft drink sales. He recalled being kidded about
the controversy by the manager of the old Statler Hotel on Wilshire
Boulevard. So, O'Malley said, he asked the manager to take him on a
tour of the hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "We went past five bars," O'Malley recalled. "I said, 'Show me
your drinking fountains.' He didn't have a single one.''</TE>
<TE>   An outraged Dodger fan told Times columnist Sid Ziff that when she
asked an usher where she could get a drink of water on opening day,
he told her she was welcome to use the restroom taps.</TE>
<TE>   The Health Department thought otherwise: The city ordered O'Malley
to install drinking fountains for the fans.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Winner of the latest stupid criminal tricks
competition is a guy who was thirsty, but not for water.</TE>
<TE>   He stole a 12-pack of beer from a Santa Monica store late the
other night. But police had only to follow the fumes.</TE>
<TE>   He was captured several minutes later, while quaffing one of the
brews in the store's parking lot.</TE>

<HD>Insecure Over Plant's Security</HD>
<DH>Safety: San Onofre's neighbors are worried because a 9/11
ban on flyovers has been lifted. Despite recent breaches, current
precautions are adequate, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Out for her morning stroll with her dog in San Clemente a few weeks
ago, Barbara Fox panicked when she spotted a plane circling the twin
domes of San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station. She rushed home to
report the sighting and find out what was going on.</LD>
<LD>   Fox was bounced between the Sheriff's Department, the CHP and the
Federal Aviation Administration before she finally got some news she
never expected: The no-fly zone placed over the power plant after the
Sept. 11 terror attacks was no longer in effect.</LD>
<LD>   "They told me it was probably just a student pilot--don't worry
about it," Fox said.</LD>
<TE>   Don't worry about it? Fox and her neighbors who live in the shadow
of San Onofre are now more concerned than ever.</TE>
<TE>   Living next to a nuclear power plant has always brought its share
of apprehensions. But in the wake of Sept. 11, residents have become
acutely aware that they live next door to what the U.S. government
acknowledges is a potential target for terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the buzz of a plane flying overhead takes on new meaning.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents are mounting a campaign to improve what they
consider lax security in and around the plant. They want more armed
guards posted, a ban on international flights within 50 miles of San
Onofre and the stationing of Marines in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from an airstrike, one of the residents' biggest worries is
access to the plant from nearby San Onofre State Beach, which shares
a parking lot with plant employees.</TE>
<TE>   Plant officials insist security is more than adequate, and the
Nuclear Regulator Commission said San Onofre is well-prepared.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a strong security program. They have not had any
significant issues identified there," said Gail Good, who oversees
security inspections at 14 nuclear sites in the western United States
for the commission.</TE>
<TE>   The pair of curvy, concrete domes of San Onofre sit about halfway
between Los Angeles and San Diego. Built and licensed in the early
1980s, San Onofre was a source of angst long before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The discovery of seismic faults beneath the plant, and a recent
proposal to store an estimated 62,500 gallons of nuclear waste at the
site, remain concerns to neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   But the terrorist attacks, in which hijacked jets were flown into
the World Trade Center and Pentagon, made residents realize the
possibility of a deliberate disaster.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after Sept. 11, officials acknowledged that the power plants
were not designed to withstand the impact of a jumbo jet.</TE>
<TE>   Plant officials say security has never been tighter and includes
background checks of employees, intruder-alert systems and detectors
for explosives and metals.</TE>
<TE>   Military resources from nearby Camp Pendleton are immediately
available, said Ray Golden, spokesman for the Southern California
Edison plant. For example, he said, any suspicious air traffic can be
reported to the Marines, "and they would then use their radar to
detect that and take any actions they deem necessary."</TE>
<TE>   Vehicle traffic is allowed only through the main entrance, where
guards remain armed with semiautomatic weapons and IDs are thoroughly
checked. Huge concrete barriers behind other gates keep trucks or
cars from barreling through. High-surveillance cameras keep a close
eye on activities around the plant.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, the Coast Guard patrols the waters, where there is a
one-mile exclusion zone that may soon be extended to five miles. And
the California Highway Patrol and state park rangers remain on the
lookout for suspicious activity in the area.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an extremely hard target," Golden said.</TE>
<TE>   But residents believe more can be done. They've proposed that San
Onofre limit stockpiling of toxic chemicals or abandon the idea
altogether, arguing that such a practice would make San Onofre a more
attractive terrorist target.</TE>
<TE>   They are asking Gov. Gray Davis to accept the federal offer of
potassium iodide drops as a radiation antidote. They also want the
warning and evacuation systems to be improved.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the NRC released a report that said that although
security at San Onofre was generally good, there were two security
breaches after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime San Clemente resident Craig McBride fishes nearly every
day from rock piles in front of San Onofre's sea wall and thinks
security is adequate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's safe," he said, shortly after hauling in a 2-pound sea bass.
"If a terrorist comes, I'll cast my fishing line and hook 'em for
you."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Alberto Beltran Garcia, 80, a noted painted, engraver and political
cartoonist in Mexico, died Friday at a Mexico City hospital of
complications from a cerebral hemorrhage.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Mexico City, Beltran began studying art when he was 15 and
soon landed a job drawing illustrations for several local publishers.
His illustrations were so popular that readers began snapping up
books that contained his work, bolstering a publishing industry that
was struggling through a prolonged sales slump.</LD>
<LD>   In the late 1940s, Beltran began drawing political cartoons and
illustrations for leading daily newspapers in Mexico City and across
the country. Later he used his industry connections to found the
now-closed, image-driven newspaper El Popular. He also helped start
the Mexico City daily El Dia.</LD>
<TE>   Beltran then turned his attention to painting, engraving and
sculpting. In 1956, he won Mexico's National Engraving Prize.</TE>

<HD>TV Helicopter Pilot Convicted in Gun Sale</HD>
<DH>Courts: Bob Pettee is found guilty of selling firearms
altered to be fully automatic. He will be sentenced in July.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former KNBC Channel 4 helicopter pilot Bob Pettee was convicted by a
federal jury in Los Angeles on Monday of selling two illegally
altered weapons through an intermediary to an undercover federal
agent.</LD>
<LD>   After deliberating more than two days, the jury found Pettee
guilty on two counts of unlawful transfer of a machine gun and one
count of possession of an unregistered firearm.</LD>
<LD>   "I certainly believe it's the wrong verdict," Pettee, 51, said as
he left the courthouse with his lawyer, Charles T. Mathews.</LD>
<TE>   Pettee, who remains free on bail, is to be sentenced July 29 by
U.S. District Judge Lourdes G. Baird.</TE>
<TE>   Taking the stand in his own defense, Pettee denied altering the
weapons so they could be used as rapid-firing machine guns. He put
the blame on a onetime friend, Jeff Miller, who pleaded guilty in the
case and is awaiting sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   Pettee, a former Vietnam helicopter pilot, said he bought a
9-millimeter Heckler and Koch pistol and an AR-15 rifle as
collector's items about 10 years ago. Both guns were not altered
while in his possession, he said.</TE>
<TE>   After learning last year that KNBC was not going to renew his
contract, Pettee said, he embarked on some belt-tightening, which
included selling the two guns.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, he said, took the weapons and promised to sell them to a
licensed gun dealer he knew. After being contacted, however, the gun
dealer notified the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,
which set up a sting. Miller was arrested when he accepted $5,000 for
the weapons in a Van Nuys parking lot Aug. 20.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty Robert Stacy said both guns were altered to be
fully automatic and that the barrel of the AR-15 rifle was shortened
in violation of federal law.</TE>
<TE>   Miller testified during the trial that Pettee had told him the
weapons were fully automatic and unregistered. Pettee's ex-wife also
testified that he had told her the weapons were illegal. The defense
accused both witnesses of lying.</TE>

<HD>Ogden Phipps, 93; Raced Nine Champions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ogden Phipps, who raced nine champions during a 70-year career as a
breeder and owner of major thoroughbreds, died Monday at Good
Samaritan Medical Center in West Palm Beach, Fla. He was 93 and died
after a short illness.</LD>
<LD>   Phipps never won the Kentucky Derby, but his understated yet
well-known jockey colors--black silks, with a cherry cap--had been
seen in winner's circles after hundreds of stakes races throughout
the country. Three of his horses--Buckpasser, Personal Ensign and
Easy Goer--are in the Racing Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.
Buckpasser was voted horse of the year in 1966; Personal Ensign
finished her career in 1988 with an undefeated record of 13
victories; and in 1989, Easy Goer won the Belmont Stakes, which
thrilled Phipps more than any of his other victories.</LD>
<LD>   Phipps' other champions were Impressive, Vitriolic, Queen of the
State, Numbered Account, Relaxing and Heavenly Prize. Many of the
Phipps runners' bloodlines could be traced to Bold Ruler, who was
bred by his mother. Bold Ruler was horse of the year in 1957 and,
perhaps, the preeminent stallion of the last century.</LD>
<TE>   Two of Phipps' children have built leading stables, and Cynthia
Phipps, his only daughter, is planning to run Saarland, a descendant
of Buckpasser, in the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs on May 4.</TE>
<TE>   "He talked about it [last] Wednesday," said Dinny Phipps, one of
two sons. "He wished [Cynthia] well in the Derby. He had been keeping
up and he was excited for his daughter to have a shot."</TE>
<TE>   Ogden Phipps' horses finished second twice in the Derby, Dapper
Dan losing by a neck to Lucky Debonair in 1965 and Easy Goer, a heavy
favorite, finishing 21/2 lengths behind Sunday Silence in 1989. Five
weeks after Easy Goer's defeat, the Phipps colt beat Sunday Silence
in the Belmont Stakes, preventing the California horse from sweeping
the Triple Crown--the Derby, the Preakness and the Belmont.</TE>
<TE>   "That was my most exciting moment," Phipps said. "I had waited a
long time to win the Belmont."</TE>
<TE>   Phipps might have raced Secretariat, who swept the Triple Crown in
1973, but a coin flip went the wrong way. Phipps won it. In 1968, the
Meadow Stable sent its good broodmare, Somethingroyal, to be bred to
Bold Ruler, with the understanding that Meadow and Phipps would split
the foals from the first two breedings.</TE>
<TE>   A coin toss between Phipps and Penny Chenery, daughter of the
owner of Meadow Stable, determined which stable would get the first
foal. Phipps won that toss and took the Bride, a filly that turned
out to be neither particularly fast nor much of a broodmare. The next
year, the Chenerys got the Bold Ruler-Somethingroyal colt, which they
named Secretariat.</TE>
<TE>   Phipps was born Nov. 26, 1908, in New York City. His grandfather,
Henry Phipps, was a partner with Andrew Carnegie in Carnegie Steel, a
company that was later sold to J.P. Morgan and became U.S. Steel. His
mother raced her horses under the Wheatley Stable banner. Ogden
Phipps studied at Harvard and was a Navy commander during World War
II. He was a seven-time U.S. court tennis champion and won the
British amateur in 1949.</TE>
<TE>   Following his mother's lead, Phipps raced his first horse in 1932
and three years later won his first stakes race. Buckpasser came
along in 1965, was voted the best of his generation for three
straight years and was retired in 1967 with 25 victories in 31 starts
and earnings of $1.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Phipps won three Breeders' Cup races--the Distaff with Personal
Ensign in 1988, the Sprint with Dancing Spree in 1989 and the
Juvenile Fillies with My Flag, a daughter of Easy Goer and Personal
Ensign, in 1995. Phipps won Eclipse Awards as best owner in 1988 and
'89 and as best breeder in 1989. In 1988, his stable earned $5.8
million.</TE>
<TE>   "He especially loved the breeding side of the business," Dinny
Phipps said. "He went every 10 days this winter to see his new crop
of 2-year-olds. The older he got, the more he got excited by the
breeding side."</TE>
<TE>   "He was an icon in this sport," said Shug McGaughey, the Phipps
family trainer for the past 16 years. "There are not many people like
him who are left in our world."</TE>
<TE>   Phipps was a trustee emeritus of the New York Racing Assn., which
operates the Aqueduct, Belmont and Saratoga tracks in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "Racing has lost a truly great man of the 20th century," said
Barry Schwartz, chairman of the NYRA. "When one speaks of 'improving
the breed,' no one epitomized that more than Mr. Phipps."</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include a son, Robert L.; a sister; and several
grandchildren and great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>State Reworks Deals With 5 Power Firms</HD>
<DH>Electricity: Changes in contracts signed during crisis are
expected to cut costs by $3.5 billion over the next decade.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM REITERMAN and VIRGINIA ELLIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>California officials announced Monday that they have renegotiated
$15-billion worth of the state's much-maligned power contracts,
trimming the costs by $3.5 billion over the next decade.</LD>
<LD>   After five months of talks, officials said they restructured
agreements with five of the two dozen companies that signed long-term
power pacts with the state at the height of the energy crisis a year
ago. And they called on other generators to come to the table and
reach similar agreements or face a legal fusillade.</LD>
<LD>   "One way or other we're going after these people," Barry Goode,
legal affairs director for Gov. Gray Davis, told a news conference
held by the state's leading energy officials.</LD>
<TE>   By settling with the state, Calpine Corp. of San Jose and High
Desert Power Plant LLC, a subsidiary of Constellation Energy Group of
Baltimore, extricated themselves from the uncertainty of state legal
action.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the deal, the state Public Utilities Commission voted
5-0 to drop a complaint asking federal regulators to declare the
contracts illegal on grounds that the companies manipulated the
electricity market. And the state attorney general reached an
$8.5-million settlement with the companies in the state's ongoing
investigation into electricity pricing practices.</TE>
<TE>   "These settlements end our enforcement claims against Calpine and
Constellation, who were willing to renegotiate their long-term
contracts ... and who were found ... to have committed smaller
violations compared to other companies," Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer said
in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Calpine Senior Vice President Joe Ronan said the company's
original state contract was valid, but officials decided their
business interests would be served best by removing the controversy
surrounding it.</TE>
<TE>   "We did not think it would be good to go through two years of
chaos.... We were looking for certainty," Ronan said.</TE>
<TE>   State officials also announced renegotiated contracts with three
companies that produce wind power--Capital Power, Whitewater Hill and
Cabazon.</TE>
<TE>   The new power deals are the first successful renegotiations of $43
billion in long-term contracts signed last year after the state
Department of Water Resources began buying power for customers of
troubled utilities.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, the governor and other officials trumpeted the
contracts as a cure for blackouts and as insurance for the future.
But the contracts looked increasingly unattractive as wholesale
electricity prices plunged and as consumer groups and auditors
exposed many weaknesses in the terms.</TE>
<TE>   Among the problems, they said, were requirements that the state
take and pay for power whether it was needed or not. The state had
contracted for more electricity than was needed, especially during
hours of low demand, and would have to sell the surplus at a loss.</TE>
<TE>   The contracts have become a political thorn for Davis as opponents
pummeled his handling of the energy crisis. In recent months, the
administration, the PUC and the attorney general have pressured
generators to renegotiate.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said the new contracts address several weaknesses. "The
state has gotten the power it needs, where it needs it, when it needs
it and at a more competitive rate," he said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   State negotiators cut the Calpine contract from 20 years to 10
years with at least $800 million in savings, and two other 10-year
contracts were reduced by two years at a savings of more than $1
billion each.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the new agreement with Constellation Energy reduces an
eight-year, three-month contract by six months while saving at least
$560 million. Constellation Vice President Paul Allen said the
renegotiation allowed his company to reduce its risk by requiring the
state to assume some of the cost of natural gas purchases.</TE>
<TE>   The new contracts with Calpine also include provisions to ensure
that new power plants are built, with the state taking over the sites
and completing the plants if the company does not follow through.</TE>
<TE>   State officials said all four Calpine contracts provide the state
improved flexibility to meet needs in the service territories of
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego
Gas &amp; Electric Co.</TE>
<TE>   V. John White, who headed a consumer coalition that waged a
campaign to force renegotiation of the contracts, said he worries
that the additional power to be purchased may not be needed.</TE>
<TE>   But White said other contract provisions were beneficial,
particularly requirements that the company complete construction of
two environmentally friendly power plants at Otay Mesa and Metcalf.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the test is going to be whether we get the plants built
and whether the amount of power we are buying is really power that we
need," he said.</TE>

<HD>Reginald Rose, 81; Writer Honored for '12 Angry Men'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He wrote in longhand on yellow legal paper, and his scripts seared
the pages.</LD>
<LD>   His stories dealing with such issues as race relations, abortion
and the right to die earned three Emmys, four Writers Guild of
America awards, four additional Emmy nominations and an Academy Award
nomination.</LD>
<LD>   Reginald Rose, the writer best remembered for his study of jurors
called "12 Angry Men," which garnered many of those top awards, has
died. He was 81.</LD>
<TE>   Rose died Friday in a Norwich, Conn., hospital of undisclosed
causes.</TE>
<TE>   Drawing on his own experience serving on an all-white male jury in
the early 1950s, Rose penned his versatile drama for television's
live dramatic anthology series "Studio One." The play described how a
single juror persuades his 11 colleagues, all determined to find a
murder defendant guilty, that reasonable doubt exists and therefore
the decision must be acquittal.</TE>
<TE>   Presented in 1954, the remarkable drama earned Emmys for Rose for
writing, for Frank Schaffner for directing and for Bob Cummings for
acting as the pivotal Juror No. 8.</TE>
<TE>   Rose also collected a Writer's Guild of America Award for his
script, and later an Oscar nomination for turning it into the 1957
motion picture starring Henry Fonda in the Cummings role. Rose and
Fonda co-produced the film.</TE>
<TE>   Rose turned the script into a play in 1964, which was first
produced in London and has become a favorite of theater companies of
various sizes over the years.</TE>
<TE>   Rose also won two Emmys for the 1961-65 television series "The
Defenders," starring E.G. Marshall and Robert Reed as father and son
lawyers. That series also stemmed from one of Rose's original scripts
for "Studio One," which had been offered in two parts in 1957. That
version starred Ralph Bellamy and William Shatner as the father and
son legal eagles, defending a young Steve McQueen for murder.</TE>
<TE>   Born in New York City, the son of a lawyer, Rose attended what is
now the City University of New York and spent four years in the Army
during World War II, rising to the rank of first lieutenant.</TE>
<TE>   He began his career writing advertising copy and publicity with
little success. But then he encountered the new medium of television
when it was attempting to put plays into people's living rooms.</TE>
<TE>   "They had all these anthologies and they were desperate for
scripts, absolutely desperate...." he told The Times in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   "I had been trying to sell short stories, novels and God knows
what else, and I never was able to sell anything. The first time I
wrote a TV script I sold it, and when I sold that first one they
said, 'More, more, more!' and I haven't stopped since.</TE>
<TE>   "In those years from 1953 to 1960, the writer was the star of the
show. It was never to happen again."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Rose's inroads, he was sometimes thwarted in his efforts
to publicize controversial social struggles. In 1954, for example, he
wrote "Thunder on Sycamore Street" for CBS' "Studio One," centered on
what happened when a black family moved into a white neighborhood.
But executives rejected that theme, and the newcomers became the
family of an ex-convict.</TE>
<TE>   Among Rose's other works for television were "The Sacco-Vanzetti
Story" and such miniseries as "Studs Lonigan" and "Escape from
Sobibor."</TE>
<TE>   Rose wrote a handful of plays for the stage, including "This
Agony, This Triumph," based on his "The Sacco-Vanzetti Story" and
first produced by the USC drama department in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   He also found success in adapting many of his teleplays into
motion picture scripts, beginning in the 1950s with "Dino" and "Crime
in the Streets," both dramas about social workers trying to help
teenage delinquents, as well as the better-known "12 Angry Men."</TE>
<TE>   More recent movies included "The Wild Geese," starring Richard
Burton in 1978, and its sequel, "Wild Geese II," starring Scott Glenn
in 1985, and "Whose Life Is It Anyway?" a 1981 black comedy starring
Richard Dreyfuss as a paralyzed man trying to legally end his life.</TE>
<TE>   "In all my work," Rose once said for the Dictionary of Literary
Biography, "my main purpose has always been to project my own view of
good and evil--and this is the essence of controversy."</TE>
<TE>   Divorced from his first wife, Barbara Langbart, Rose is survived
by his second wife, the former Ellen McLaughlin, whom he married in
1963; and six sons, Andrew, Christopher, Jonathan, Richard, Steven
and Thomas.</TE>

<HD>Sanchez Gave Chilling Hint, Witness Says</HD>
<DH>Testimony: Murder suspect allegedly told a friend the Simi
Valley hills would be a good place to hide a body, detective tells
court.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two weeks before the slaying of college student Megan Barroso, murder
suspect Vincent Sanchez told a friend that the Simi Valley hills
would be a good place to hide a body, according to court testimony.</LD>
<LD>   Barroso's body was found Aug. 4 in a steep ravine southeast of the
city. She died of a gunshot wound to the abdomen, and Ventura County
prosecutors contend Sanchez pulled the trigger.</LD>
<LD>   Sanchez, 31, is charged with murder, kidnapping and the attempted
rape of Barroso, 20, of Moorpark.</LD>
<TE>   For two weeks, prosecutors have questioned witnesses at a
preliminary hearing in Ventura County Superior Court to show a judge
they have enough evidence to proceed to trial.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, prosecutors Lela Henke-Dobroth and Dee Corona concluded
their presentation after calling a sheriff's detective who had
interviewed Sanchez's friend and neighbor, George Fernandez.</TE>
<TE>   Det. Scott Peterson testified that Fernandez told him that during
a drive with Sanchez in the Simi Valley hills in late June, a week or
two before Barroso's slaying, the defendant remarked that the area
"would be a good place to hide a body."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys Neil Quinn and Jan Helfrich tried to challenge
Fernandez's credibility. On cross-examination, they revealed
Fernandez didn't report Sanchez's alleged statement until being
reminded of it "in a dream."</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Frueh, a former roommate of their client who has known
Fernandez for several years, later offered this opinion of the
witness: "I don't believe anything that comes out of his mouth."</TE>
<TE>   Peterson testified at length about Fernandez's interview.</TE>
<TE>   On the same night they went driving, Fernandez and Sanchez shared
nearly a case of beer while sitting on lawn chairs in front of the
defendant's Simi Valley house, Peterson said.</TE>
<TE>   Fernandez told the detective that Sanchez was weepy, depressed,
drunk and talked about killing himself with a gun.</TE>
<TE>   When Fernandez questioned him, Sanchez--who has since admitted to
raping seven women--said he was having problems with his girlfriend
and that "he had done some other things that were causing him
stress."</TE>
<TE>   As Fernandez questioned Sanchez further about his access to a gun,
the defendant went inside his Woodrow Street residence and came out
with an AK-47 assault rifle, Peterson testified. Barroso was killed
with the same type of weapon, according to previous court testimony.</TE>
<TE>   On cross-examination, Peterson acknowledged that Fernandez
admitted to being "very intoxicated" during his conversations with
Sanchez. Fernandez also mixed up dates during his police interview
and couldn't recall how much the two drank before driving into the
hills that night.</TE>
<TE>   In other testimony Monday, Frueh told Judge Ken Riley that
sometime between 1 and 3 a.m. on July 5, he awoke and noticed that
Sanchez's truck was gone. He awoke again before daybreak, he said, to
find Sanchez washing the green Ford Ranger in the garage.</TE>
<TE>   Barroso was driving home from a Fourth of July barbecue when she
allegedly was stopped by Sanchez before being shot about 3 a.m. Her
blood was found in the truck by crime lab technicians.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony will resume April 30.</TE>

<LD>Rural-minded Nipomo residents are taking on what they consider an
urban plague akin to big-box stores, traffic congestion and fouled
air: light pollution.</LD>
<LD>   They don't want a picket fence of street lights illuminating
roadways because they interfere with stargazing and detract from the
community's rural flavor.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, San Luis Obispo County officials are looking at
alternatives, such as reflective strips, and aren't putting in lights
unless deemed necessary for safety.</LD>

timber harvests in several imperiled watersheds.</LD>
<LD>   After a hearing that stretched over parts of two days and into the

<LD>   Kristin Bengyel had requested $37,800 more to bring in an outside
psychiatrist for the Behavioral Health Department. Bengyel said
psychiatrist Dr. Lynn Pappas is treating 1,300 clients.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors were suspicious of why the county's caseload had
increased from 350 two years ago to 1,300. Pappas said the office
treats people with disorders of the brain and that brain chemistry
problems had become more prevalent.</LD>

convicted of bribery and making false statements in connection with a
money scam.</LD>

<HD>Davis Gets Bill to Boost Unemployment Benefits</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state Senate on Monday passed and sent to Gov. Gray Davis a bill
that would increase unemployment benefits by $100 a week for workers
who lost their jobs after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and for many
others.</LD>
<LD>   Davis, who sponsored the bill (SB2), has said he will sign it. But
it is not certain when the benefits will start flowing. The bill
originally would have started the payments as soon as the governor
signed it, but Assembly Republicans defeated that feature.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, the legislation should take effect 90 days after the
current special session ends, perhaps at mid-summer or later. The
final Senate vote, with Republicans voting no, was 23 to 13.</LD>

<HD>Religious Leaders Reject Secession</HD>
<DH>Ethics: Group finds no evidence that a split would help the
poor, protect rights or improve public safety. But it acknowledges
legitimate grievances with the city.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles is profoundly dysfunctional but secession is not the way
to fix its problems, a panel of the region's top religious officials
said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The Council of Religious Leaders of Greater Los Angeles concluded
that secession proponents have failed to show how breaking up the
city would help the poor, improve public safety or protect the rights
of residents, all characteristics of a ''good'' or ethical city.</LD>
<LD>   Currently, three proposals to break up the city of Los Angeles are
under study by state officials. If secession measures for the San
Fernando Valley, Hollywood and the harbor area survive scrutiny by
the Local Agency Formation Commission this spring, they could be
placed on the ballot as early as November.</LD>
<TE>   The council, whose members include Cardinal Roger Mahony of the
Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, Rabbi Mark S. Diamond of the
Board of Rabbis of Southern California and Bishop Jon Bruno of the
Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles, studied secession for a year from
an ethical perspective.</TE>
<TE>   ''There is no evidence that the poor and disenfranchised of the
new cities and of the remaining city will be better off after
secession,'' the group said in a report released Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The group agreed to study secession last year, at the behest of
Mahony.</TE>
<TE>   ''We looked at it from a moral and theological dimension,'' Bruno
said. ''We talked about the pros and the cons and [asked], 'Will this
improve the care of the poor and the disenfranchised?'''</TE>
<TE>   The group's answer, Bruno said, ''was that it will not.''</TE>
<TE>   Still, the report said, secession proponents have ''legitimate''
grievances about the city of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   ''We're very dissatisfied with the way Los Angeles currently
functions,'' said Rabbi Alan Henkin, regional director of the Union
of American Hebrew Congregations, the organization of Reform Jewish
congregations. ''We just don't think something as drastic as
secession is the answer.''</TE>
<TE>   The group stopped short of urging members and congregants to vote
against secession, but Henkin, who was acting as the group's
spokesman, said he expects a number of the council's members to do so
as individuals.</TE>
<TE>   ''I will personally do it as Alan Henkin,'' the rabbi said. ''But
we want people to come to their own conclusions. We are encouraging
our congregations to sponsor educational forums.''</TE>
<TE>   Tod Tamberg, spokesman for the Catholic Archdiocese, said the
church probably will not take a further stand on secession until the
measures reach the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   ''Once that happens, we will assess the appropriate next step,''
Tamberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Close, co-chairman of the pro-secession group Valley VOTE,
said he believes breaking up Los Angeles would help the poor "on both
sides of Mulholland" Drive, which would separate a new Valley city
from Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   A new Valley city, he said, would seek funds for social services
more aggressively than Los Angeles, he said.</TE>
<TE>   And, Close said, if the religious leaders agree that Los Angeles
is dysfunctional, they should support secession, because ''there are
no alternatives.''</TE>

<HD>Bullet-Riddled Mercedes Could Help Solve Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A gold Mercedes-Benz with bullet holes in it may be the key to
finding the motorist who wounded an off-duty traffic officer in a
car-to-car shootout on the Harbor Freeway, police said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "It's already an unusual car," Los Angeles Police Department
spokesman Jack Richter said. "But now it's an unusual car with bullet
holes in it."</LD>
<LD>   A South Traffic Division officer on his way to work traded gunfire
with the driver of the Mercedes on Sunday afternoon when the car,
which was being driven erratically, pulled alongside the officer's
pickup near the Century Freeway.</LD>
<TE>   The 27-year-old officer, who was struck in both legs, got off the
freeway onto Manchester Avenue and called for help. He remained
hospitalized Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the driver had three passengers in the mid-1990s,
four-door Mercedes-Benz 500 with tinted windows.</TE>
<TE>   Police don't know what prompted the shooting. The officer was
driving his own vehicle and was not trying to make a traffic stop,
police said.</TE>
<TE>   "They might not have known he was a police officer," Richter said.</TE>

<HD>Simon Takes On Davis Over Fund-Raising</HD>
<DH>Politics: Republican candidate says as a public official,
incumbent should disclose details, and he'll do the same after he's
elected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gubernatorial hopeful Bill Simon Jr. took aim Monday at Gov. Gray
Davis' prodigious fund-raising, challenging the incumbent to disclose
more details of how he collected roughly $45 million toward his
reelection.</LD>
<LD>   But even as the Republican nominee demanded to know how much time
Davis spends raising money, he declined to set the same standard for
his own campaign. He said he would release details of his
fund-raising schedule only after he became governor.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not a public official yet, so I'm not working yet for the
taxpayers and for Californians," Simon said.</LD>
<TE>   "The distinction to me is this: Gov. Davis works for all
Californians. He owes it to the people of California to spend a
significant portion of his day doing what he was elected to do. I'm a
private citizen at this present time."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to reporters at a sidewalk news conference in front of
the state building in downtown Los Angeles, Simon released the draft
of a letter to Davis questioning how the governor has managed his
blistering fund-raising pace at the same time the state has faced an
energy crisis, budgetary fallout from the recession and myriad other
problems.</TE>
<TE>   "In the face of all these challenges, the public deserves to know
how you have had time to raise over $1 million per month," Simon
wrote. "Yet, you refuse to release your fund-raising schedule so that
the public can evaluate whether you spend adequate time actually
governing the state you were elected to serve."</TE>
<TE>   If he becomes governor, Simon said, he would support campaign
finance legislation that "would require a governor to disclose the
amount of time he has spent fund-raising."</TE>
<TE>   But Simon would not commit to releasing his entire schedule as
governor--something Davis and his predecessors have also balked
at--and took no position on other campaign-finance proposals,
including public financing of political campaigns, or legislation
that would seek to curtail the amount of money wealthy individuals
can pour into their own campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   "What I'm prepared to discuss today is focusing on disclosure,"
Simon said, even as he refused to release his own fund-raising
schedule.</TE>
<TE>   In response, the Davis campaign suggested Simon was issuing the
challenge to deflect attention from the tax issue that has dogged him
the past week. Simon, a wealthy investment banker who personally
financed most of his primary campaign, has declined to release his
tax returns, saying the legally required finance disclosure report he
issued in December offers "a very exhaustive and extensive look at
pretty much everything to do with my finances."</TE>
<TE>   A Davis spokesman made much the same argument Monday in dismissing
Simon's challenge to release the governor's fund-raising schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is all of the relevant information on all of the
governor's fund-raising that people would be interested in--who gave
money, how much they gave, when they gave it--is all publicly
available to anyone who wants it," said Roger Salazar, a spokesman
for Davis' campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Simon tried to slough off the tax return issue, there were
new signs of division within the troubled state GOP.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, the California Republican Assembly, a group of
conservative activists, unanimously passed a resolution urging repeal
of reforms imposed on the party by the Bush White House and the
president's state lieutenants.</TE>
<TE>   The changes, adopted last fall, are designed to professionalize
the party's operations and provide greater financial accountability
to the state's major donors. The move also enhanced the power of
Bush's California allies, who hoped to nudge the California GOP in a
more moderate direction.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the repeal vote, the resolution asserted that the
leadership team installed by the White House has fallen well short of
the party's fund-raising goals for the November election.</TE>

<HD>7 Ordered to Stay Clear of 2 South Gate Officials</HD>
<DH>Politics: Mayor and councilwoman get restraining orders
against residents. Meanwhile, council OKs $100,000 to pay for city
treasurer's legal defense.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSE CARDENAS and GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the latest chapter in South Gate's running political drama--awash
in recall drives and corruption investigations--two City Council
members have obtained temporary restraining orders against seven
residents accused of everything from stalking to physical assaults.</LD>
<LD>   In a separate development, the council on Monday night voted to
pay the criminal defense fees of city Treasurer Albert Robles. He was
arrested April 5 on suspicion of making terrorist threats against
Assemblyman Marco Antonio Firebaugh, state Sen. Martha Escutia and a
South Gate police officer. He also is accused of possessing two
illegal assault weapons, including a semiautomatic rifle.</LD>
<LD>   The restraining orders against residents were obtained by Mayor
Xochilt Ruvalcaba and Councilwoman Maria Benavides. The orders,
issued by a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge in Norwalk,
prevent the residents from coming within 50 yards of the officials.</LD>
<TE>   But the seven--Sam and Marilyn Echols, Joseph Ruiz, Veronica
Molina, Pascual Cervera, Shirley Bobrick and Frank Rivera--will be
allowed to attend the usually raucous City Council meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Benavides said she has "stopped going to events because ... I
didn't feel safe walking along the street."</TE>
<TE>   The subjects of the restraining orders could not be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   The declarations filed in support of the restraining orders
include descriptions of the city officials being followed around town
and even an incident in which Ruvalcaba and Benavides were allegedly
hit with bundles of paper in a City Hall conference room.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor and councilwoman say they are most disturbed because
it's the female officials who are being targeted.</TE>
<TE>   "Being a woman," said Ruvalcaba, "it's really hard to be in the
environment where we are."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, by a 3-2 vote, council members agreed in closed session
Monday to pay the Los Angeles law firm of Sheppard, Mullin and
Hampton a $100,000 retainer for the city treasurer's defense.</TE>
<TE>   Council members Henry Gonzalez and Hector De La Torre dissented.
Those who voted to pay for the defense, Ruvalcaba and council members
Raul Moriel and Benavides are--along with Robles-- the subjects of a
recall drive launched by residents who allege corruption. They have
denied the accusations.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez said he thinks ''it's wrong to expend the taxpayers'
money to defend a public official for something that, like I said, is
not job-related."</TE>
<TE>   He noted that the city has already paid $114,000 in legal fees on
the Robles case.</TE>
<TE>   De La Torre said that the council arrived at its vote by
determining that Robles' actions were ''in the scope of Mr. Robles'
job and there was no malice there, and that it is in the best
interest of the city to get involved in it.'' He called those
conclusions ''ludicrous on their face.'</TE>
<TE>   "He can ... have the defense he wants,'' he said of Robles. ''But
we shouldn't have to pay for it."</TE>
<TE>   The decision was met with groans from about 100 residents in the
council chambers.</TE>
<TE>   "They have the right to decide, but it's the wrong decision," said
Rafael Aguila, 65, a 22-year resident of South Gate. "We aren't
supposed to pay for all the wrongdoings of politicians. That's the
bottom line. It's not fair."</TE>
<TE>   Council member and Vice Mayor Moriel, who voted in favor of the
retainer, clarified that the council voted not to defend Robles
against the weapons possession charges--only against the allegations
of terrorist threats.</TE>
<TE>   Robles has been charged by the district attorney's office with
seven felony counts alleging that he has threatened to
harm--including to murder--several people he considers political
enemies.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that among other threats, Robles told two
people, one of them a Lynwood official, that he wanted to harm
Escutia and her husband, Leo Briones. "If I could get away with it,
I'd have [Briones] killed and rape [Escutia]," he is alleged to have
said.</TE>
<TE>   Robles has denied the charges.Through his attorney, Robles has
claimed that the case is a politically motivated punishment for
standing up to powerful political figures in southeast Los Angeles.
He said he uses strong language against his opponents, but that such
language merely reflects his strong convictions.</TE>
<TE>   If he is found guilty, the 37-year-old faces up to eight years in
prison.</TE>

<HD>Tax Season Leaves State Even Shorter</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A combination of weak personal income tax receipts and a jump in
refund claims is setting the stage for California to face an even
bigger budget shortfall than previously anticipated.</LD>
<LD>   Personal income and corporate tax receipts for the first three
weeks of April were running about 15%, or $470 million, below last
year. Personal income tax refunds, meanwhile, were up 13%, or about
$135 million.</LD>
<LD>   The news grew grimmer Monday when the state counted $1.2billion in
personal income tax receipts, compared with $3.5billion on the same
Monday last year.</LD>
<TE>   "The daily totals are way below both last year's level and the
budget estimates for the month," said Brad Williams, senior economist
with the state's nonpartisan legislative analyst's office. "Things
can change; we've had surprises before, but clearly there's going to
be a major shortfall."</TE>
<TE>   Williams attributed a mail glitch for contributing to the
unusually high $3.5-billion figure last year. The glitch aside,
Williams said if the pattern continues to hold, he expects the state
to take in about $5billion in personal income taxes in April,
compared with the $6.7billion his office forecast for the month.</TE>
<TE>   The weak revenues could cause the state's projected $17.5-billion
budget shortfall to grow by an additional $1.7billion. So far, state
officials have addressed about $4.3billion of the problem through
cuts, budget changes and by refinancing the state's debt.</TE>
<TE>   Williams said the jump in refund claims is tied to weak tax
receipts. Californians, he said, were making estimated tax payments
on bonuses and raises that failed to materialize.</TE>
<TE>   "People with investments in the stock market don't have anywhere
near the capital gains they've had in prior years," Williams said.
"People that receive stock options have seen the value of those
options decline a great deal over the last year.... Many of the stock
options are now underwater."</TE>
<TE>   The gloomy revenue picture comes as the Davis administration
prepares to release its revised budget on May 14. The spending plan
the administration released in January counted on the state taking in
$8billion in personal income taxes in April and pegged the shortfall
at about $12billion.</TE>
<TE>   The state will receive another key piece of financial information
today when the federal government releases personal income data that
will help determine how much the state owes schools under Proposition
98, the complex funding formula that dedicates about 35% of the
general fund to kindergarten through community college education.</TE>
<TE>   The analyst's office predicts schools are owed about $1 billion
more than the Davis administration estimates.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Steve Peace, the El Cajon Democrat who chairs the
Senate Budget Committee, said the recent tax data suggests that at
best the state is headed toward a high budget shortfall in the
neighborhood of the $17.5 billion previously forecast by the
analyst's office.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll have to cut more and borrow more," Peace said. "My personal
position is that we should borrow everything the market will allow us
to borrow as long as we can get competitive interest rates and
terms."</TE>
<TE>   Peace does not believe the state will need to raise taxes to close
the budget gap but he said he remains concerned about a possible
cash-flow problem.</TE>
<TE>   "What was a very difficult problem is now a very, very difficult
problem," added Assemblyman John Campbell, the Irvine Republican who
handles budget matters for his caucus.</TE>

<DH>Education: Chauncey Veatch of Coachella Valley High is
named teacher of the year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The newest national Teacher of the Year almost wishes he could refuse
the honor.</LD>
<LD>   Chauncey Veatch, a retired Army colonel who started teaching seven
years ago in rural California desert schools, said he appreciates the
chance to share his love for teaching during the next year as a
spokesman for the profession. But the social studies teacher regrets
having to leave his classroom at Coachella Valley High School in
Thermal, just east of Palm Springs, to do it.</LD>
<LD>   He will be honored this week at a ceremony in Washington, D.C.,
for his devotion to his students, many of whom are from migrant
worker families. In June, Veatch will start a yearlong paid
sabbatical to visit schools and educational conferences throughout
the country.</LD>
<TE>   "I receive my reward literally every day I'm with my students in
the classroom, so it's an amazing irony that in being selected for
this award it will take me away from them," Veatch, 54, said in a
telephone interview from a Washington hotel room. "But I feel a
responsibility to my students and the community to share the
excitement I feel about being a teacher and the countless miracles
going on in the classroom every single solitary day."</TE>
<TE>   Of the 2,900 students at Veatch's school, about 96% are Latino and
half of those come from migrant families. Veatch said he has a
special affinity with those migrant workers' children because he
spent his own childhood shuttling around the country with his
military family.</TE>
<TE>   "I celebrate what they bring to the classroom rather than focusing
on what they've missed," said the Palm Desert resident, who followed
his brother and sister into teaching after 22 years in the infantry
and medical services corps. "Teachers aren't here to throw roadblocks
in their way. We're here to urge them to dream."</TE>
<TE>   Veatch started his second career as an eighth-grade teacher and
spent three years taking night and summer classes to earn his
teaching credential before transferring to the high school. He
broadens the curriculum to include a heavy dose of community service,
leading students to distribute health information to farm workers and
to tutor third-graders.</TE>
<TE>   "Believing our students can succeed is not a desire or facade but
something he actually lives," said Richard Alvarez, former Coachella
Valley principal. "This caring can be seen in his eyes, heard in his
voice, felt in his presence and mostly seen in his actions."</TE>
<TE>   The Teacher of the Year program is sponsored by the Council of
Chief State School Officers and educational book publisher Scholastic
Inc. Colleagues nominate teachers for state-level awards, and a
15-person panel of education professionals selects the national
winner. Veatch is the first Teacher of the Year from Riverside County
and the fifth from California.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's Teacher of the Year, a social studies teacher from
Vermont, helped with Veatch's selection. "He really cares deeply
about the children," said Michele Forman. "Not just that they do well
on tests but that they make the community around them better."</TE>

<HD>Golf Carts May Blaze a New Trail</HD>
<DH>Laguna Woods, which includes Leisure World, might allow the
vehicles on a path along busy El Toro Road. Seniors praise the
proposal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA BORGATTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Martha and Charles Hellmann have a special spot in their garage where
they keep their little white Club Car plugged into an electrical
outlet and parked next to their new champagne-colored Chrysler van.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, it may be just a golf cart to some. But to the Hellmanns,
it's a second car. They use it to buzz from clubhouse to clubhouse
and visit friends in the sprawling, gated community of Leisure World
in southern Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   And soon, they may be able to putter beyond the gates to the
grocery store, bank or post office.</LD>
<TE>   Laguna Woods, a city of 20,000, plans to build paths along El Toro
Road, the city's main thoroughfare, so that residents--most of whom
live in Leisure World--can tool around town in their golf carts.
Pedestrians and bicyclists would be able to use the paths as well.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council this month approved the concept and is expected
to complete a plan this summer.</TE>
<TE>   The community is one of several nationwide to allow golf carts on
public streets or special paths in an effort to increase convenience
and reduce traffic, noise and pollution.</TE>
<TE>   Already, the excitement is building at the thought of putting
around Laguna Woods at 15 mph.</TE>
<TE>   "The sooner the better," said Martha Hellmann, 77. "I think it's
great. It opens more doors for us in Leisure World."</TE>
<TE>   There are about 1,200 registered golf cart owners in Leisure
World, said Terri Quinlan, a Leisure World spokeswoman. And many use
the carts for transportation, not golf.</TE>
<TE>   For El McElney, 81, a golf cart means independence. Her husband,
who died in December, did all the driving.</TE>
<TE>   She gave up her driver's license 15 years ago and now relies on
friends to take her into town or to her weekly bridge games. But
since a driver's license isn't required to operate a golf cart,
McElney now envisions the day she can motor to the grocery store.
"Wouldn't that be so wonderful?" McElney said.</TE>
<TE>   While Laguna Woods would be the first Orange County city to make
special road provisions for golf carts, the concept is not unique. In
Playa Vista, a new residential and commercial village near Marina del
Rey, golf carts or electric cars could even come with the house.</TE>
<TE>   "When people buy a home here, they'll be able to buy one of these
electric vehicles as part of their house--the cost will be built into
the mortgage," said Steve Soboroff, president of Playa Vista. "The
question won't be: 'Do you want one?' The question will be: 'Do you
want a blue one or a yellow one?'"</TE>
<TE>   Soboroff envisions the streets of Playa Vista dominated by golf
carts or their electrical cousins, such as the Ford Think
Neighborhood Electric Vehicle or the Daimler Chrysler-owned GEM car,
which look like golf carts but go faster.</TE>
<TE>   As a rule, golf carts--which cost anywhere from $1,400 for a used
model to $15,000 for a new custom cart--are banned from public
streets. But low-speed electric cars, which can go about 25 mph, are
allowed on roads with a posted speed limit of 35 mph or lower.</TE>
<TE>   Palm Desert began building golf cart lanes along city streets
nearly a decade ago, and 25 years before that cart lanes emerged as a
key ingredient in the development of Peachtree City, Ga., a town
southeast of Atlanta with about 32,000 residents. Roughly a fourth of
Peachtree's residents use the 80-mile network of paths.</TE>
<TE>   "The beauty of it is that you can go virtually anywhere you want
to in the city on these paths," Peachtree City Mayor Steve Brown
said. "From my house, I can go to Blockbuster Video, I can do my dry
cleaning, I can go anywhere I want to go."</TE>
<TE>   Brown likens the carts to a horseless carriage and says people
seem to be friendlier to one another when they're riding in them.
People smile and wave to each other as they pass by. And, he said,
accidents are rare.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had some accidents ... but about the worst is when someone
doesn't pay attention to where they're going and maybe runs off the
path and rolls down a hill," Brown said. "But those accidents are
almost insignificant compared to traffic accidents in regular cars."</TE>
<TE>   Still, some Laguna Woods officials are concerned about
safety--particularly since a fair portion of the city's golf cart
users are elderly and may have eyesight or reflex problems. And the
paths would run parallel to one of the county's busiest streets.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great concept, but when you look at the volume of traffic
and the speed of the traffic along El Toro Road, there are a lot of
safety issues that need to be figured out," Laguna Woods Mayor Jan
McLaughlin said.</TE>
<TE>   The initial plans call for a short wall and landscape buffer that
would separate the "alternative vehicle path" from the rest of the
road. But officials might consider other options, including moving
the path away from the street, City Manager Leslie Keane said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're plowing new ground here," Keane said. "So we want to take
some time, see if the golf cart path would work or see if we need to
do something a little different and go off the street with a path."</TE>
<TE>   City officials expect to spend about $2 million on the path--start
to finish--and will seek grants to cover the majority of that cost.
Last year, the city received a $100,000 grant from the Orange County
Transportation Authority that will go toward the project.</TE>
<TE>   If the city decides to go ahead with the idea, the result could be
a less congested El Toro Road.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always good when you provide a means to accommodate
alternative transportation, be it bicycles or pedestrians or golf
carts," said Larry Wymer, a traffic engineering consultant with the
firm of David Evans and Associates. "A golf cart, especially, would
allow somebody to make a trip that's too far to go on foot without
clogging up the roadways."</TE>
<TE>   Charles Hellmann thinks it's a good idea too.</TE>
<TE>   "The golf carts are made to travel at a safe speed," he said. "The
only thing you have to be careful of is that you stay on the right
paths and follow all the safety precautions. That way, you won't get
into any trouble."</TE>

<HD>Senate OKs Judge Debra Yang as L.A.'s Top U.S. Prosecutor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Senate on Monday unanimously confirmed Los Angeles Superior Court
Judge Debra W. Yang as the top federal prosecutor in Southern
California, making her apparently the first Asian American woman in
the nation to become a U.S. attorney.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush nominated Yang for the job less than three weeks
ago. Unlike other law enforcement and judicial posts that have been
slowed by bickering between Democrats and Republicans, her
appointment sailed through the Senate without opposition.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) praised the selection, citing
Yang's five years of service as a judge in Los Angeles municipal and
superior courts and her six years as a federal prosecutor.</LD>
<TE>   Yang, 42, could not be reached for comment Monday after the Senate
vote. In an interview this month, she said she was eager to begin
assessing the needs of the U.S. attorney's office, although she added
that she had no immediate changes in mind.</TE>
<TE>   Headquartered in Los Angeles, the U.S. attorney's office
prosecutes federal crimes referred by the FBI, Drug Enforcement
Administration and numerous other law enforcement agencies in a
seven-county area that includes Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San
Bernardino, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. With
15.4 million people, it is the most populous region served by any
U.S. attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Yang will assume leadership of the office at a time of profound
change in federal law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   The office traditionally has prosecuted a range of federal crimes,
including drug trafficking, bank robberies, white-collar crime,
kidnapping, murder and other violent crimes. But since the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, federal authorities have sought to train their
resources more squarely on counter-terrorism to bolster the nation's
security, and officials acknowledge that they may have to back off
other investigations as a result.</TE>
<TE>   Yang, active in Republican affairs, was chosen to succeed former
U.S. Atty. Alejandro N. Mayorkas, a Democrat, who resigned last
April. The office, with 245 lawyers, has been headed on an interim
basis by John S. Gordon, a career prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   Yang, whose grandfather emigrated from China, is a 1985 graduate
of Boston College Law School. She is the first Asian American woman
to lead the Southern Californian prosecutor's office.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein's staff said that, based on what they have been told by
the Asian American Bar Assn., Yang also is believed to be the first
Asian American woman to hold the post of U.S. attorney in the
country.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A decade after the Los Angeles riots, increasing but still uneven
signs of economic rebirth are scattered throughout South-Central Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   On a corner once home to a rundown strip mall and a shuttered
industrial plant, residents pack a spotless Starbucks coffee shop to
socialize over $3 lattes.</LD>
<LD>   Big-name developers are negotiating deals to transform other corner
lots into shopping centers, finally convinced there is money to be made
serving hundreds of thousands of customers who have paltry shopping
options. Local nonprofits have built dozens of new subsidized housing
projects.</LD>
<TE>   The parts of South Los Angeles that were most vibrant before the riots
have shown clear improvement: To the west of South-Central, the Crenshaw
district's Leimert Park is buzzing with new business, and construction is
evident in the northern neighborhoods of West Adams and University Park.
Banks have stepped up small-business and mortgage lending.</TE>
<TE>   But to a far greater degree than in other areas touched by three days
of burning and looting in 1992--Mid-Wilshire, Pico-Union, Compton and
Long Beach among them--poverty and blight persist at the riot's epicenter
in South-Central.</TE>
<TE>   It was here that post-riot talk of recovery focused. City leaders
formed a corporate-led organization to take on the task. But Rebuild
LA--or RLA, as it came to be known--contended that reversing decades of
stagnation would require more than rebuilding. Neglected neighborhoods
needed more than 74,000 new jobs and $6 billion in investment, an early
analysis found.</TE>
<TE>   What came to pass fell far short of that.</TE>
<TE>   When RLA disbanded five years ago, it reported that $389 million in
corporate investments had been made, although millions of dollars were
spent outside the riot-torn neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   The riots coincided with a deep recession, and few job-creating
initiatives were undertaken. But even as the overall economy
rebounded--ushering in the longest peacetime economic expansion in U.S.
history--South Los Angeles suffered. From 1992 to 1999, the area lost
more than 55,000 jobs--more than any other part of the city, according to
the Economic Roundtable, a public policy research group. Average wages
too dropped in relation to the county average.</TE>
<TE>   Today, of about 600 properties in the city that were destroyed or
seriously damaged, more than a fifth still have not been rebuilt--almost
all of them in South-Central. Some double as used-car lots, illegal swap
meets or recycling yards. Others host carnivals a few times a year. But
many sit unused, littered with trash that collects against the chain-link
fences that surround them.</TE>
<TE>   More national retailers now view dense but poor neighborhoods as
opportunities. That has spurred interest from big developers, which are
bringing crucial financing to projects that still overwhelmingly depend
on public subsidies. Scattered government and community programs have
helped some small businesses and spurred construction of subsidized
housing, and political backing has helped push some projects through.</TE>
<TE>   But politicking just as often has held things back. Large-scale
commercial development remains costly. Many entrepreneurs and residents
survive on the margins of solvency.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got more part-time jobs, more lower-wage jobs," said Marva
Smith Battle-Bey of the Vermont Slauson Economic Development Corp. "We
got a few more fast-food restaurants, but very little has changed."</TE>
<TE>   Four major intersections reflect the variety of reasons for the mixed
recovery of South-Central.</TE>
<TE>Western and Slauson: Development Milestone</TE>
<TE>   For five years, Aishia Rogers traveled the three blocks from her house
to her job at Pic 'N' Save with a growing sense of dread.</TE>
<TE>   With no security guards, shoplifters strolled out the door without
hiding their take. Last year, Rogers was robbed at gunpoint twice in two
weeks--by the same guy. At $7.50 an hour, her job as an assistant manager
hardly seemed worth the risk.</TE>
<TE>   Today she works just across the street. In many ways the neighborhood
is unchanged: The Pic 'N' Save remains, along with the corner liquor
store and the bustling nearby swap meet.</TE>
<TE>   But Rogers feels a world of difference. The 9-month-old Chesterfield
Square shopping center, where she earns $9.50 an hour as a Home Depot
bookkeeper, stands as South-Central's brightest development success.</TE>
<TE>   The center rose from the site of a shuttered dairy plant in three
years, unusually fast for a project here. It is packed with national
retailers that long avoided South-Central. The center brings quality
services and about 600 desperately needed jobs to the area, and its
success could have a ripple effect on surrounding neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   This corner escaped immediate damage in 1992, but there was little to
destroy. It had been abandoned by industry, whose legacy remains in
contaminated soil and obsolete brick buildings.</TE>
<TE>   The Chesterfield center also offers a Food4Less, a Starbucks and a
Subway. A Radio Shack and an International House of Pancakes are on the
way. The imposing security gates that surround many South-Central
shopping centers are absent, replaced by landscaped hillocks. Undercover
security is prevalent, and graffiti are immediately removed.</TE>
<TE>   The project has inspired a gratitude that astonishes even its
developers, who have received tearful thanks and standing ovations from
residents.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not really the neighborhood; it's how you keep the store," said
Rogers, 24, who lives in the nearby 51st Street duplex where she grew up.
"If you keep it nice, people aren't going to tear it up."</TE>
<TE>   For developers, the project serves as a potential model of what can be
done in South-Central. Tenants are paying Westside-level rents for access
to customers like Rogers--not because they are wealthy but because they
are so plentiful.</TE>
<TE>   Home Depot and Food4Less--the only supermarket that agreed to locate
to Chesterfield--are exceeding sales projections in their stores by more
than 15%, according to developers Chris Hammond and Gerald Katell.</TE>
<TE>   Two other high-powered development companies taking on projects at key
South-Central corners say Chesterfield Square is helping smooth the way.</TE>
<TE>   Hammond, a veteran South Los Angeles housing developer, targeted the
languishing site for a shopping center in 1997. But he could not have
done it without the cash-flush Katell.</TE>
<TE>   The button-down Republican and marathon runner made his name
developing suburban office parks--not shopping centers. But the spending
power of area residents tipped the scales.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked at it conceptually and said, 'The demand is there,' " Katell
said.</TE>
<TE>   The project was plagued by all the ills common to South Los Angeles
development: More than half a dozen pieces of land had to be bought and
pieced together, tenants relocated, aging buildings demolished and
contamination cleared.</TE>
<TE>   But the initial private financing from Katell meant developers could
begin without a subsidy. Ultimately they were forced to seek nearly $8
million in loans and grants through the city. But the project already was
on its way.</TE>
<TE>   Also key to the deal was a $14-million short-term loan from the
federally funded Los Angeles Community Development Bank to buy the land.
The development bank--the federal government's largest response to the
riots, created to lend up to $430 million--has been plagued by failures.</TE>
<TE>   But the Chesterfield loan served the bank's mission well: to make a
difference in the lives of people like Rogers.</TE>
<TE>   The Crenshaw High School graduate gets better health benefits for
herself and her 9-year-old daughter and discounts on corporate stock. She
has been promoted twice since August and is using a computer for the
first time. At home, Rogers painted, re-tiled her kitchen and replaced
her bathroom sink and cabinets. And last month she was inaugurated into
Starbucks culture.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to ask somebody what to get," Rogers said with a laugh. "I
tried the white mocha, and I've been getting those every day."</TE>
<TE>Western and Vernon: Blight and Poverty</TE>
<TE>   Two men have stood watch over this intersection for more than three
decades. The pharmacist from Selma, Ala., and the obstetrician from
Atlantic City, N.J., bought land and set up shop next door to one
another.</TE>
<TE>   Each brought health services lacking in most black neighborhoods. And
together they have watched the intersection's fortunes wither, along with
their own.</TE>
<TE>   Western and Vernon, a mile away from the success of Chesterfield
Square, reflects the reality of commerce in many parts of South-Central.</TE>
<TE>   "All I've seen is people going out of business," said the pharmacist,
John Fuller.</TE>
<TE>   Fuller recently sold his 31-year-old business because of mounting
financial troubles, and he no longer owns the building. But he still
shows up some evenings to help out. Fuller, a sturdy figure in dress
slacks and a black cardigan, knows many of his down-and-out customers by
name. He has helped some get sober and given them odd jobs and a place to
live upstairs. And he has seen many spiral back down, mirroring the
intersection's eddy of low expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no money in the area. People aren't working," Fuller said.
"It's gotten worse, and it's continuing to get worse."</TE>
<TE>   Just to the north, Dr. Clifton V. Lee can't offer a much brighter
view. He opened his Western Women's Medical Clinic here in 1963 as one of
a handful of black obstetrician-gynecologists in the state. The graying
72-year-old physician vows to be in this area until he dies.</TE>
<TE>   What Lee hoped would be an investment to lift the neighborhood and
ensure him steady income has become an albatross. On the northeast corner
sits a vacant commercial building that he built just before the riots.</TE>
<TE>   "Across the street you see my dreams and my retirement," he said from
his medical office. "I've had small businesses over there that last for
three or four months. It's always been a deficit to me."</TE>
<TE>   Rioters spared Fuller and Lee a decade ago, but storefronts all along
this stretch of Western were gutted, plunging the hard-luck neighborhood
into deeper despair.</TE>
<TE>   Drug-related crime is not as bad as it once was, merchants and
residents say, but the neighborhood is still unsafe. Other than a Shell
gas station, businesses are small independents. Cash-starved, many fail.
The nail shop in Lee's building was robbed repeatedly, then shuttered.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, a Louisiana Fried Chicken/China Express opened last year, but
two other franchises died in quick succession--first a Church's, which
neighbors say was plagued by robberies, then a burger joint.</TE>
<TE>   Next to Lee's building, a spiritual reader offers help in "business,
bad luck, enemies, love, job." But what passes for commerce here is thin.
Ann and John Miller, who live at the business, get one or two customers a
day and sell used cars "now and then" on the side, John Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   Partly to blame for the intersection's ills, Lee said, is a lack of
savvy. His empty building stands as evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas leased the building
after the riots but moved his district office to new digs at Vermont and
Manchester avenues in 1995. Worn out by a parade of failed start-ups, Lee
searched for a single tenant that would contribute to the community. He
found it in Triumphant Word Community Services, a local church that
planned a charter school for black boys.</TE>
<TE>   The nonprofit needed a building before it could receive approval for
the school. But after the church signed a long-term lease last year, its
school plans were thwarted, and it has fallen behind on payments, Lee
said.</TE>
<TE>   Training and resources for small businesses became a focus of
nonprofit recovery efforts after the riots, but many entrepreneurs have
no idea where to turn for help.</TE>
<TE>   "I take it month by month," said Louisiana Fried Chicken's Mike Pe,
26, who runs the business with his father and siblings.</TE>
<TE>   Pe is fortunate to have a parking lot, something most businesses in
the area lack, but advertising and other frills are outside his range.
His main investment: a wall of bulletproof glass that protects the
service area.</TE>
<TE>   The neighborhood has potential. Four bus stops bring substantial foot
traffic to the area. But merchants see little hope while most
neighborhood residents struggle to get by.</TE>
<TE>   Said Fuller: "Build a factory here so we can get meaningful
employment, not $6-an-hour jobs at McDonald's. I don't see any other
way."</TE>
<TE>Vermont and Manchester: Mixed Bag</TE>
<TE>   The ABC Swap Meet was the first business on its corner to catch fire.
When the rioting ended, dozens of entrepreneurs were ruined.</TE>
<TE>   All told, 22 structures in the vicinity of Vermont and Manchester
burned, causing $15 million in damage. Few intersections told the story
of destruction so starkly--a fact politicians quickly exploited.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) guided Bill Clinton across the
rubble when he campaigned for president. Then came the tours with Jack
Kemp, then-secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Even Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan took a turn.</TE>
<TE>   The blackened ground became a podium for political promises. And
politics has largely been responsible for a half-baked recovery--some
hard-won successes framed by failures frozen in time.</TE>
<TE>   There are victories: More than $50 million in public and private
investment flowed into the area within half a mile of the intersection,
said Ridley-Thomas, who championed the projects. On the west side of
Vermont stands his constituent service center, townhomes for first-time
buyers and apartments for senior citizens. And on the east, a new
alternative high school is scheduled to open soon.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, Waters claims her victory in Community Build, a nonprofit she
created that works to transform gang members through job training and
other programs.</TE>
<TE>   But a decade later much of the northeast corner remains the same:
empty lots stretching north with two lonely rebuilt structures and a
cluster of abandoned ones. Above one battered roll-top door, a
spray-painted "Black Owned" is still legible, one of many attempts by
merchants desperate to save their livelihoods from rioters' wrath.</TE>
<TE>   A shopping center that promised to revitalize the corridor--known in
its heyday for its streetcars and thriving commerce--has not yet
materialized.</TE>
<TE>   Politicians "did a lot of talking," said Rodney Shepard, who developed
the 36 owner-occupied townhomes across Vermont Avenue at 81st Street.
"When they left, the cameras left, and we didn't see a whole lot of
improvement."</TE>
<TE>   Shepard's project itself is a mix of success and failure: It has won
architectural awards and brought pride and equity to its residents, many
of them first-time buyers. But plans for street-level shops never took
off.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating the project was the long-running political battle between
Ridley-Thomas and Waters. He backed the project, but she blasted it,
pushing instead for commercial development that would bring jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "I can tell you this: Much more would have been done had she been in a
more constructive and collaborative mood," Ridley-Thomas said.</TE>
<TE>   Countered Waters: "It's been a series of starts and stops over the
past 10 years. . . . I think Mark Ridley-Thomas has been the biggest
obstacle."</TE>
<TE>   Further slowing development, a group of anti-redevelopment activists
filed suit to block the city's Community Redevelopment Agency from
designating Vermont and Manchester a project area.</TE>
<TE>   Redevelopment enables the city to use eminent domain to piece together
small commercial parcels into larger projects. Future increases in
property tax revenue are plowed back into the area to foster more
development.</TE>
<TE>   But opponents of redevelopment, calling themselves Concerned Citizens
Against the Land Grab, argued that the neighborhood failed to meet the
legal definition of blight. For four years, litigation wound through the
courts.</TE>
<TE>   The group ultimately lost in 2000, but the fight crippled the CRA,
preventing it from acquiring property or cutting development deals, said
CRA Deputy Administrator Donald Spivack.</TE>
<TE>   Economic recession compounded matters, denying the area the hoped-for
increase in property tax revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Caught in the middle were landowners on the northeast corner who had
held off developing in the belief that they would benefit from a
redevelopment project.</TE>
<TE>   "Why? Why did none of this happen?" said Eli Sassoon, whose family
owns much of the three-block property slated to become the shopping
center.</TE>
<TE>   Leafing feverishly through file folders in the office of his ornate
Beverly Hills estate, he pulls out evidence of his thwarted efforts to
develop the site. There's a commitment letter from supermarket chain
Ralphs in 1998 and plans and letters of interest dating back years from
Lucky, Hughes and Vons.</TE>
<TE>   Now, many of those retailers have probably given up, Sassoon said, and
Food4Less is negotiating a lease with another big developer--Regency
Centers--for a shopping center less than a mile away.</TE>
<TE>   But others believe that a shopping center soon will come to this
neighborhood, a collection of Spanish stucco homes largely occupied by
middle-class blacks in Vermont Knolls to the west and by Latino
immigrants in the crowded rentals to the east.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Roski's Majestic Realty, which built Staples Center, is in
exclusive negotiations with the CRA to develop at Vermont and Manchester,
in partnership with the neighborhood's Crenshaw Christian Center. An
estimated $16 million in subsidies must be pieced together to make the
project work, according to CRA documents. But Majestic broker Vince Evans
said agreements are in place with apartment owners whose buildings would
be razed for the shopping center.</TE>
<TE>Central and Vernon: Immigrants Moving In</TE>
<TE>   Ana Luz Cisneros greets a burst of customers at her brother's shoe
store a few blocks north of Vernon, using broken English and a strained
smile to ply $10 tennis shoes to a black customer who loudly calls her
"Mama."</TE>
<TE>   All along this stretch of Central Avenue, little businesses like this
one are popping up, in some cases breathing life into storefronts closed
for years.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, blue motorized cleaning machines scrub the gum and grime from
the sidewalks. Pedestrians are plentiful. And artful banners celebrate
both the corridor's historic significance as a black jazz hub and its
will for a healthy future: Moving Forward, Looking Back.</TE>
<TE>   This stretch of Central Avenue doesn't lack for life. Signs of
commerce abound, in clusters of discount stores, bargain clothing shops
and street vendors. What was destroyed when rioters burned the
intersection and scarred this stretch of Central largely has been
rebuilt. Growing numbers of Central American and Mexican immigrants--many
with young children--have made this neighborhood their first stop.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels and smells like economic activity, and a lot of it has to do
with the demographics," said Ruth Teague, director of urban development
for Dunbar Economic Development Corp., which works to revitalize the
area.</TE>
<TE>   Here too government and nonprofit efforts to raise the fortunes of the
once-historic strip are plentiful. But beneath it all lie hard economic
realities. Residents are poor, and many live below the radar of the
formal economy. Competition for their sparse resources means there is
little prosperity for anyone.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way I survive is I'm the owner of the land and I don't pay
rent," said Amir Khani, who bought and rebuilt Emilio's Discount
Store--which he had previously leased--after rioters burned it to the
ground. Customers are "really, really low-income," he said, noting: "If
you sell something for $1.99 and the other guy sells it for $1.98,
they'll go and buy it there."</TE>
<TE>   Still, change is unmistakable, pushed in part by a gaggle of
redevelopment practitioners. The Dunbar group has built low-income and
senior housing and spearheaded efforts to fix the sidewalks and install
decorative trash bins and lighting.</TE>
<TE>   It removes graffiti, keeps the sidewalks clean and is launching a
program with two other nonprofits to channel needed loans to small
businesses such as Cisneros'.</TE>
<TE>   The CRA plans a massive tree-planting program and is working with
newly elected Councilwoman Jan Perry to build a constituent service
center. To the north, the city's Department of Parks and Recreation
transformed one burned and blighted property into a park that plays host
to jazz musicians and skateboarders.</TE>
<TE>   South of Vernon, the nonprofit group Concerned Citizens of South
Central has purchased five small vacant lots and plans townhouses for
first-time buyers. The group also is working with Regency Partners to
develop the neighborhood's first shopping center, at Central and Slauson
avenues.</TE>
<TE>   Where fires gutted Central and Vernon, one corner remains undeveloped,
its three tiny lots separately owned. A mere 25 feet wide each, they
aren't suitable for much more than small mom-and-pop stores, said Herbert
Marshall, the CRA's project manager for the area. He hopes to transform
the vacant lots into a park.</TE>
<TE>   But the rest of the intersection rebounded in its way: A Jack in the
Box was rebuilt, along with a neighboring discount store. A mini-mall was
promptly replaced, filled now with a check-cashing operation, a Chinese
fast-food restaurant, a nail salon and a doughnut shop, among other
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Driving the commerce is a demographic shift that is transforming all
South Los Angeles but is most pronounced on its eastern edge. In the
one-mile radius that surrounds this intersection, the Latino population
grew to 83% in 2000, from 70% in 1990, and the number of children under 9
grew by 14%. The African American population fell to 15% from 29%.</TE>
<TE>   The elderly black owners of a dry cleaners (who used to show off a
suit they say Cab Calloway never reclaimed) died a few years ago. In
their business' place is Diego's Thrift Shop, filled with a mishmash of
old furniture, used clothing and knickknacks.</TE>
<TE>   But with those changes come tensions.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the small stores here employ only family members or other
Spanish speakers, leaving job-seeking black residents with fewer options.</TE>
<TE>   And for merchants, who compete with unlicensed street vendors, profit
margins are paper-thin.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of traffic here, but in this business you have to sell
a lot to make money," said Daniel Cohen, manager of D&amp;D, a bargain
clothing store that opened last year at the site of a shuttered
black-owned herbal shop. "People don't have work, and when they get to
the first of the month they have to pay the rent."</TE>
<TE>   Cisneros' brother, who owns the store, holds on to his low-wage day
job at a garment factory, helping here only on off hours. The Cisneroses
are so strapped for cash they can't afford garbage pickup. Instead, they
take trash home or dump it in the sidewalk's already-overflowing bins.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Khani is optimistic. He recently bought and revamped another
building down the street and soon will open a 99-cent store.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's no competition, there's no improvement," he said. "If we
make this a nice-looking neighborhood, things will get better."</TE>

<HD>Parks Hangs Up His Badge</HD>
<DH>Police: The chief appears relaxed as he announces retirement, says
he will not sue city. He confirms political aspirations.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks said Monday that he plans
to step aside within days to allow an interim chief to take the helm of
the Police Department and confirmed rumors that he is contemplating a run
for City Council.</LD>
<LD>   Parks, whose request for a second term was rejected by the Police
Commission earlier this month, also said he will not sue the city because
of his ouster. Although the outgoing chief said he believes he has legal
grounds for a lawsuit, he said he doesn't want Los Angeles taxpayers to
foot the bill.</LD>
<LD>   Looking strikingly relaxed and good-humored in a suit and tie--a sharp
contrast to his tense demeanor at many points in recent weeks--Parks
officially ended his 37 years with the LAPD with a brief afternoon speech
in front of LAPD headquarters at Parker Center.</LD>
<TE>   His statement was largely devoid of the contentiousness that
characterized the political debate around his failed request for
reappointment. The issue of whether he had earned a second five-year term
had unfolded amid a racially tinged political storm that came to a close
late last week when the City Council, by an 11-3 vote, decided not to
move to overturn the commission.</TE>
<TE>   Parks, the city's second African American chief, was widely credited
with breaking racial barriers at the LAPD by rising steadily through the
ranks after entering the force in the late 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   He failed to win support for his reappointment from Mayor James K.
Hahn, who rode into office with considerable backing from black voters.
Black activists later said they felt betrayed by the mayor's position,
and Parks subsequently suggested that maneuverings by the LAPD officers
union, the Police Protective League, were instrumental in ousting him.</TE>
<TE>   Parks only made passing references to these allegations Monday, saying
that the proceedings had exposed obvious deficiencies in the
reappointment process.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he focused on possible political plans, thanking the city for
"a rewarding and fulfilling career." He said he plans to take a few days
off to rest before returning briefly while the commission goes about
deciding on an interim chief. The commission will then make
recommendations on a permanent chief to Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   Parks, 58, whose term as chief was due to end in August, said he
expects his official retirement date to be sometime next week. But he
said, "it is my expectation to continue to be involved in public life,"
and is considering running for the 8th District City Council seat in
South Los Angeles now held by Mark Ridley-Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   Ridley-Thomas, who is leaving the City Council due to term limits, is
running for a state Assembly seat. If he wins that seat, he would leave
the council in January 2003 and if he loses, he would officially vacate
the seat in June 2003. His successor will be chosen in the election of
March 2003.</TE>
<TE>Plans to Study Secession of San Fernando Valley</TE>
<TE>   If Parks chose to run, he would have to officially declare his intent
by early November. Six people so far have filed with the city's Ethics
Commission to raise funds in that race: Assemblyman Roderick Wright
(D-Los Angeles), Robert Cole, Sherri L. Franklin, Kevin Melton, Mervin L.
Evans and Karen Bass.</TE>
<TE>   Parks said he was still weighing whether to run, and is assessing his
prospects. In the meantime, he said, he will devote his time to
volunteering on voter registration efforts and studying San Fernando
Valley secession, which he said represents a fundamental voter revolt
against political leadership in the city. Parks stopped short of voicing
opposition to secession Monday, saying he needed to study the issue
further.</TE>
<TE>   If Parks chooses to reenter public life as a politician, he would be
treading in the footsteps of another LAPD chief-turned-lawmaker: his
friend and mentor Ed Davis. Chief until 1978, Davis ran unsuccessfully
for governor. Eventually, he served three terms as a Republican state
senator.</TE>
<TE>   Former Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, the city's only African American
mayor, also rose from the ranks of the LAPD to a career in city politics.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime political consultant Rick Taylor said Parks would be a
shoo-in for the City Council seat if he chooses to run.</TE>
<TE>   "If Chief Parks decides to run for any council district, I believe
it's his," Taylor said. "I can't image anyone beating him. Bernie is a
figure in the African American community. He's very, very popular."</TE>
<TE>   Police Commission President Rick Caruso said commissioners will
consider a list of internal candidates to appoint as interim chief today.
However, commissioners will want to interview several candidates before
making a final decision on a temporary replacement, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In explaining why he voted against Parks' reappointment earlier this
month, Caruso had made critical public comments that clearly rankled the
chief, who countered that Caruso had unjustly attacked his character and
reputation.</TE>
<TE>   When Parks appeared at a news conference shortly after accompanied by
two attorneys, it appeared that Parks might sue the city for a monetary
settlement, as did his predecessor, Willie L. Williams. Although Parks'
attorney, Gloria Allred, gave a statement at Monday's news conference
detailing why she thought the chief was entitled to sue, Parks said he
has no intention of doing so.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their rift over the reappointment decision, Parks and Caruso
spoke briefly by phone before the news conference. Caruso described it as
a short but cordial conversation.</TE>
<TE>   "I appreciate the fact that he called me," Caruso said. "And I frankly
appreciate the fact that he did take the high road."</TE>
<TE>Old Opponents Join Ranks to Praise Chief</TE>
<TE>   Caruso and Parks were not the only ones to put aside acrimony Monday.
Parks' announcement seemed to put his most vehement critics in a
magnanimous mood.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to thank Chief Parks on behalf of all the people of Los
Angeles for his service of 37 years with the LAPD. We all owe him a great
debt of gratitude," said Hahn in a news conference after Parks'
announcement.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn had strongly and repeatedly attacked the chief as he sought to
keep his job in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   Even leaders of the Police Protective League, who had campaigned
vehemently against Parks, chimed in, releasing a written statement
thanking the chief for his years of service.</TE>
<TE>   Parks was uncharacteristically brief in his comments Monday, cutting
short reporters' questions. Afterward, he was mobbed by friends and
family members. He hugged and shook hands with many of them as he made
his way out the back of Parker Center, joking and smiling.</TE>

<HD>2 Nixon Daughters, 1 Big Feud</HD>
<DH>The former president's daughters aren't speaking to each other in a
dispute over the control of his library. The rift stalls talks on
acquiring his papers and further threatens his legacy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FAYE FIORE</AU>
<AU>GERALDINE BAUM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The body of Richard Milhous Nixon was scarcely in the ground when
the struggle for control of his legacy had begun. It was April 28, 1994.
His grieving daughters and their husbands were bound from the El Toro
Marine base to New York on the plane that once served as their father's
Air Force One.</LD>
<LD>   They were a comfortable foursome that had practically grown up
together: Tricia and Julie--inseparable in youth, maids of honor at each
other's weddings--and the sons-in-law who melted seamlessly into the
Nixon clan, feeding the patriarch's hunger for political discourse at
every Christmas gathering.</LD>
<LD>   The disgraced former president had spent his final years polishing his
tarnished image as his daughters retreated to their separate lives. On
the day he was buried at the presidential library in Yorba Linda, his
funeral appeared to be a national rite of forgiveness. Every living
president lined up to mourn him. He was hailed as a statesman. The
nine-acre library and birthplace memorialize his rise from country lawyer
to the commander in chief.</LD>
<TE>   But that day on the plane, the dark forces that haunted Nixon in life
seemed to reach beyond the grave. Somewhere between the two coasts,
Edward Cox, Tricia's New York attorney husband, brought up a plan to
ensure the Nixon library would be tightly controlled by the family rather
than by hired hands.</TE>
<TE>   While the subject might have seemed innocuous enough, Cox had touched
a nerve that would bitterly divide the Nixon sisters as they struggled to
sort out how much of their father's legacy belonged to history and how
much belonged to them.</TE>
<TE>   Years of mudslinging, perceived slights and betrayals followed that
cross-country journey home, and finally, a pair of lawsuits filed earlier
this year pitted one sister against the other. Today, they do not speak.
The library their father hoped the sisters would co-direct showcases
Julie and shuns Tricia, who tells friends she has not been invited there
in five years.</TE>
<TE>   This gardened place the exiled president worked so hard to build is
better known for wedding parties than for serious research. It still does
not house his presidential papers. And two lawsuits are pending over a
$19-million bequest from his dearest friend.</TE>
<TE>   "It's beyond tragic. I couldn't imagine facing the old man in this
situation," Kenneth L. Khachigian, a Nixon confidant for decades, said of
the rift. "He would be crestfallen."</TE>
<TE>   For most of their lives, Nixon's daughters were bonded by love and
crises. Now in their 50s, their common goal is a library that preserves
the positive legacy of their father's presidency, from relations with
China to detente with Russia. Yet, they disagree about how that should be
managed--and by whom.</TE>
<TE>   Friends and family believe the sisters' loyalty was undermined by a
defiant library director, sons-in-law with career ambitions, Nixon
disciples eager to claim their piece of one president's legacy--all
pointing to each other in a riot of blame.</TE>
<TE>   But like so many sibling rivalries, this rift may have its roots in
the personalities of two very different women, mirror opposites in youth,
linked by devotion to their famously troubled father.</TE>
<TE>   The tale of their struggle is purely Nixonian: a man whose obsession
with political power undermined his presidential vision. Now his
daughters' battle for control is jeopardizing his legacy. And their
shared desire to put the Nixon scandals in proportion to the Nixon
successes has resurrected some of the ugliness they sought to bury.</TE>
<TE>Daughters Stand by Father With Love</TE>
<TE>   They were model little girls in starched coats and hats, one blond and
round-faced, the other dark-haired and angular. Their father may have
been Dwight D. Eisenhower's vice president, but Pat Nixon made sure her
daughters knew how to grocery shop and use a steam iron.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the public thought of Nixon, his children reflected a loving
father whose daughters stood by him in triumph and shame. When campus
protesters painted him a heartless warmonger, Tricia recast him as father
of the bride and shifted the nation's eyes to her Lenox china pattern and
her Rose Garden wedding. When the shame of Watergate engulfed him three
years later, a defiant Julie defended him to the world.</TE>
<TE>   They attended prestigious private schools and were the centerpiece of
the Washington social scene, but they paid the inevitable price. As a
sophomore at liberal Smith College in Massachusetts, Julie participated
in a mock Republican convention where no one would volunteer to play her
father and students jeered at the mention of his name.</TE>
<TE>   "It was hell on Earth for me," she wrote in her published diary.
Threatened protests kept her from her graduation. And the stigma of
Watergate kept her from running for office in Pennsylvania. Still, she
remained one of his most ardent public defenders.</TE>
<TE>   Tricia rarely spoke openly--the White House press corps dubbed her the
"Mystery Princess"--but her loyalty to her father was no less steadfast.
She stayed close to home, choosing Finch College in New York while he
practiced law there. Nearly 23, she moved with her parents to the White
House in his first term (the younger Julie was already married). It was
Tricia who marshaled the family, arms locked, for a final White House
news photo as the scandal expelled them from Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "They were important to Nixon from the beginning of time," said
Leonard Garment, special counsel to Nixon during Watergate. "They were
attractive, engaging, stable young ladies and that spoke well for Nixon
as a parent and as a human being."</TE>
<TE>   When Nixon's wild ride finally ended, his daughters seemed to welcome
a reprieve from the harsh limelight.</TE>
<TE>   For Tricia, that meant a life of chosen obscurity as the wife of a
corporate lawyer. The Coxes lived off Fifth Avenue in Manhattan in an
apartment of chintz fabrics, Oriental rugs and family photographs in
tasteful numbers. When she was spotted in public, it was in suits and
heels, impeccably groomed, her blond hair pulled back and fur draping her
shoulders. The couple, quintessential New Yorkers, didn't own a car.</TE>
<TE>   For Julie, a busy soccer mom in a one-story farmhouse in Berwyn, Pa.,
life was piling the kids into the family wagon. She and her husband,
David Eisenhower, wrote books--he also lectured at the University of
Pennsylvania--and life was consumed by homework and Little League.</TE>
<TE>   Those were good years of relative privacy. In the backyard of the big
house in Saddle River, N.J., where Richard and Pat Nixon had retired on
four acres, there was whiffle ball and swimming, Chinese takeout and
plays staged by the four grandchildren. Holidays were an all-family
affair.</TE>
<TE>   The daughters spoke every day as they shepherded their ailing parents
through old age. Tricia nursed Pat Nixon after her stroke. Julie amused
her father with stories about his grandchildren. Together, they buried
them both.</TE>
<TE>   But Richard Nixon's death left his daughters to sort out a tangle of
controversial bequests and hard decisions about the future of the Nixon
Foundation that runs the library and birthplace. Their allegiance to
their father had always been primary, and when he died, their allegiance
to each other was tested as never before.</TE>
<TE>   The potential for disagreement faced them daily, whether over tax
ramifications or how to spend the foundation's endowment. Said one person
close to the family who, like most others interviewed for this story,
spoke anonymously to avoid publicly taking sides or jeopardizing pending
lawsuits: "We regard presidential offspring as royalty, but we don't
completely subsidize them the way the Brits do, so they're caught between
selling what is bequeathed to them or acknowledging that in some way it
belongs to history."</TE>
<TE>Nixon's Heirs Spend Years in Disputes</TE>
<TE>   In the last years of his life, Nixon was forever dashing off memos to
the Oval Office or meeting with some foreign head of state at Tricia's
Manhattan apartment. "Write me an essay on whether the U.S. should help
Gorbachev!," he would kindly command his young researcher, Monica
Crowley.</TE>
<TE>   The ailing president was on a mission to repair his reputation, finish
his memoirs and build his library. Before he died at 80, he did it all.
Almost.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Nixon's painstakingly detailed will, his heirs would spend
years figuring out how to run the library and how to get back the
presidential papers, seized by the federal government, after he resigned
to ensure they weren't destroyed. They worried about whopping estate
taxes. A bequest from an old Nixon friend who had made anti-Semitic
remarks was shaping up as a public relations embarrassment.</TE>
<TE>   But whatever tension there was over the library's future seemed to
exist more between the two couples and John Taylor, the ambitious
executive director handpicked by Nixon, than between the sisters
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of 1996, Tricia and Julie were equally disenchanted with
Taylor and wanted him fired. They wrote a letter accusing him of refusing
to take their calls and objecting to his plan to reduce family control of
the library.</TE>
<TE>   "We will carry out our father's wish that his family play a decisive
role in the governance of his library and Foundation," they wrote. They
dispatched longtime Nixon friend Khachigian to fire Taylor, who resisted,
threatening to bring a lawsuit and mounting a campaign to save his job,
Khachigian said.</TE>
<TE>   By then the library was in utter turmoil. One board member resigned in
the winter of 1997, saying the foundation had become a "plaything of the
family." Edward Cox seemed to be on a campaign against Taylor, convinced
he was trying to hijack the library. Taylor was building his own case
against Cox, accusing him of making abusive late-night telephone calls to
the library staff and demanding protection from estate taxes.</TE>
<TE>   The unrest cost the library dearly. A $5-million bequest by the late
pharmaceutical tycoon Elmer Bobst was withdrawn by his widow as Nixon
friends and family debated whether anti-Semitic comments by the donor
would embarrass the library. A $26-million offer from the federal
government that would have returned Nixon's presidential papers and paid
for a building to house them was scuttled by his daughters, who feared
high estate taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the solidarity between Tricia and Julie remained intact.</TE>
<TE>   Then something changed. Sometime between December 1996 and the
following May, Julie switched her allegiance from her sister to Taylor.
Without apparent explanation, she signed an agreement to expand the
board, giving herself and her sister no more weight than any of the other
22 members.</TE>
<TE>   The couples were now divided into two camps: The Coxes, who want the
Nixon family to control the major decisions regarding the library,
including its budget, and the Eisenhowers, who want an empowered
professional staff and an independent board of directors with Julie and
Tricia on it.</TE>
<TE>   In retrospect, the seemingly innocuous conversation on that retired
Air Force One out of El Toro took on new meaning. Cox has described the
remarks he made about family control of the library as "offhand." But the
Eisenhowers felt exploited in their time of grief, friends said.</TE>
<TE>   Eight years later, things have only gotten worse. With Julie's
blessing, the Nixon Foundation filed a lawsuit in California ordering her
sister to sign off on a $19-million bequest from Nixon's longtime friend,
the late Bebe Rebozo. A companion suit filed in Florida is suing the
Rebozo estate to force it to relinquish the much-needed money, stuck for
years in a probate court because of the disagreement. Judges in both
cases have urged the family to settle the matter out of court.</TE>
<TE>   Friends say Tricia has been effectively cut out of the library's inner
circle. While the staff disputes that contention, her identity has
clearly devolved into a sideshow attraction best remembered for her Rose
Garden wedding and the cake of 400 egg whites: "Picture yourself being
married near the very gazebo that Tricia Nixon Cox was married under in
the White House Gardens . . . " the library Web site beckons.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Julie is a library ambassador. Just last month, Taylor
and the Eisenhowers went to China in commemoration of her father's
historic diplomacy there 30 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever made Julie break from her sister is not clear. Both refused
to be interviewed. But there is evidence that Julie was lobbied hard by
other board members that winter of 1997 to spare Taylor's job and cut the
family's influence--including her own--in the running of the library.</TE>
<TE>   "Total hoo-ha," said Taylor, who contends Julie was never lobbied. She
decided to support him 24 hours after she attempted to fire him, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But others believe an important influence was Walter Annenberg, the
publishing magnate and Nixon's ambassador to Britain, who apparently
urged Julie to back Taylor and his plan for reduced family control.</TE>
<TE>   It might have been an easy case to make. The Eisenhowers and
Annenbergs are longtime friends with professional ties--David Eisenhower
has worked since 1997 as a public policy fellow at the University of
Pennsylvania's Annenberg School of Communications, named for its generous
and influential donor.</TE>
<TE>   And while Tricia's world has quietly centered on her family, Julie has
made a career writing and lecturing about life as Nixon's daughter. Her
husband is a published historian, and they might be more likely to
conclude that a larger, experienced board of directors would be better
suited to manage his legacy.</TE>
<TE>   "Walter was very fond of both girls, but particularly of Julie," said
a longtime associate of Annenberg. "Walter was involved with several
presidential libraries, gave them a lot of money, and felt very strongly
that they should be run with integrity, which to him meant public boards
and accountability."</TE>
<TE>   Those in Julie's camp counter that Cox had his own motives for keeping
tight control over the library, using it to expand his base of influence
as he mused about a career in politics.</TE>
<TE>   Cox has denied it. He and his wife have insisted their goal all along
has been to help create a credible institution, accountable to the
family. Their complaint has been with the Taylor regime, not with the
idea of professional management.</TE>
<TE>   The upshot: Nothing has melted their enmity, not even what happened on
Sept. 11. The library's quest for prestige is at a standstill.
Negotiations to acquire the papers are stalled. Of America's 11
presidential research centers, Nixon's holds the unwanted title of the
one "with no books."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps worst, the Nixon name is once more associated with lawsuits,
personal attacks and betrayals. In the rift, the subject of international
news, the sisters took up the roles their parents assigned them in
childhood--Julie "The Speaker" and Tricia "The Thinker."</TE>
<TE>   At a recent Redondo Beach lecture, Julie told 1,000 listeners of the
"heartbreaking" split.</TE>
<TE>   Tricia, friends say, is "more than ready to defend her father's
legacy," but through her husband and old family emissaries. She has seen
it all and has little interest in public life anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "Nixon has enough to overcome in terms of his legacy and his political
history," said Crowley, the researcher who worked with Nixon until his
death. "Now he has to overcome the in-fighting between his daughters.
It's so sad. There's another obstacle for him to clear."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Catholics and Vatican Face a Cultural Chasm in Coping With Sex
Scandal</HD>

<DL>VATICAN CITY
</DL>
<LD>A month ago, long after clerical sex scandals had mushroomed in the
United States, the Colombian cardinal overseeing the worldwide Roman
Catholic priesthood fielded a barrage of questions from reporters here
over how the Vatican would respond.</LD>
<LD>   Defensive and irritated, Cardinal Dario Castrillon Hoyos portrayed the
scandals as the product of an American "culture of pansexuality and
sexual licentiousness" and noted sourly that most of the questions were
in English. "This by itself is an X-ray of the problem," he said.</LD>
<LD>   Today, when 12 American cardinals lay the sex abuse crisis before Pope
John Paul II and his top aides, what the Vatican had long viewed as an
"American problem" will become its own.</LD>
<TE>   The Americans' immediate goal is to persuade the Vatican to authorize
the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops to impose unprecedented binding
procedures on all 195 U.S. diocesan bishops for addressing clerical sex
abuse.</TE>
<TE>   But more fundamentally, the extraordinary two-day meeting here is an
opportunity to bridge a cultural gap between the Curia--the central
Vatican bureaucracy that is dominated by Italians and, to a lesser
extent, by other Europeans and Latin Americans--and Catholics in the
United States, whose church is one of the world's largest and richest.</TE>
<TE>   The divide reflects conflicting values: New World openness versus Old
World secrecy, American home rule versus Vatican centralization,
Anglo-Saxon CEO-style management versus a Mediterranean
forgive-and-forget attitude toward sinners.</TE>
<TE>   The chasm helps one understand a range of conflicts between the
Vatican and American Catholics during John Paul's long reign, including
disputes over academic freedom at Catholic universities and inclusive
language in the liturgy. And it helps explain why the pope and his aides
failed at first to grasp the scale of the current crisis, the American
church's worst in modern times.</TE>
<TE>   Senior U.S. clerics, summoned here on a week's notice, said Monday
that they were encouraged by the Vatican's belated attention and the
chance to explain the American perspective.</TE>
<TE>   For today's opening session in the frescoed Sala Bologna, in the
Apostolic Palace, the Vatican is sending eight top curial officials--up
from the original list of three--to meet with the Americans. The pope
will address the group today and attend as many of the sessions as his
schedule allows, the Vatican said.</TE>
<TE>   "The more members of the Holy Father's Curia who are engaged in the
discussion, the better it is for the church," said Bishop Wilton D.
Gregory of Belleville, Ill., president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic
Bishops, who will join the American delegation. He said the talks will
allow Vatican officials "to ask the questions that perhaps they do not
fully understand in terms of the crisis we are facing."</TE>
<TE>   The two sides have a history of misunderstanding.</TE>
<TE>   Since the 19th century, when Pope Leo XIII cracked down on what he
called "Americanism," the Curia has viewed American culture as deeply
rooted in Calvinist individualism, lacking a strong concept of community
or the church.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, in 1989, John Paul became concerned that the American
church was spinning beyond his control. He summoned all American
archbishops, including cardinals, to Rome. The discussion ranged
widely--from the high rate of remarriage for divorced American Catholics
to the American hierarchy's tolerance for dissent within the church.</TE>
<TE>   John May, then archbishop of St. Louis, crystallized the clashing
perspectives in his opening remarks.</TE>
<TE>   "Authoritarianism is suspect in any area of learning or culture," he
said. "To assert that there is a church teaching with authority binding
for eternity is truly a sign of contradiction to many Americans who
consider the divine right of bishops as outmoded as the divine right of
kings."</TE>
<TE>   The response by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger of Germany, the Vatican's
guardian of doctrinal orthodoxy, was equally blunt: Bishops must remember
that they are "guardians of an authoritarian tradition."</TE>
<TE>   Since then, papal appointments have brought the American church
hierarchy more into line, but disagreements have persisted.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, for example, a papal document on higher education required
theologians at Catholic universities to get certification from their
bishops that they were teaching authentic Catholic doctrine. U.S. bishops
resisted, arguing in defense of academic freedom. To many of them, the
Vatican effort smacked of loyalty oaths and blacklisting.</TE>
<TE>   The American reaction, in the Vatican's view, was a rebellious
assertion of individual freedom against the collective good of the
church.</TE>
<TE>   A few years later, the Vatican began objecting to the use of inclusive
language--the word "people," for example, instead of "man"--in English
translations of Latin liturgical texts. It demanded new powers over the
translators--a panel set up by English-speaking bishops conferences
around the world. Bishops in America balked.</TE>
<TE>   Both disputes--over universities and translations--were settled on the
Vatican's terms, after lengthy discussions with American bishops.</TE>
<TE>   The sex scandals have highlighted a new set of cultural differences,
along with what George S. Weigel, an American theologian and papal
biographer, called "an urgency gap" between the Vatican and American
Catholics.</TE>
<TE>   One difference is over the Vatican perception that pedophilia is
mostly an American problem.</TE>
<TE>   Many American Catholics resent that view. They believe the U.S. is
taking the lead in grappling with a problem that is hidden in many other
societies but will eventually confront the church worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Pedophilia scandals have already hit the Catholic Church in Canada,
Australia, Ireland, Britain, France, Germany, Mexico and Poland. But the
phenomenon has gained far more attention in America, where the culture
makes victims less inhibited about stepping forward and the right to sue
in court offers the prospect of financial damages.</TE>
<TE>   The Vatican is immersed in Italian culture, which, like many others,
regards sex abuse and other aberrant human behavior as inappropriate
fodder for public discussion.</TE>
<TE>   When Mexico's bishops met this month, they claimed that their country
had no abuse cases--then admitted it did. Still, Mexican Archbishop
Sergio Obeso told a news conference that evidence of crimes will not be
turned over to the civil authorities, because "dirty laundry is washed at
home."</TE>
<TE>   "The reaction in the United States is, 'Just wait and see,' " said
Father Thomas J. Reese, who edits the Jesuit magazine America. "For
cultural reasons, it's a lot more difficult in the Mediterranean
countries and in Latin America for a young man to come forward and say
publicly that he was abused as a child. But concern about sex abuse is
going to spread from the United States and hit many other countries in a
few years. There's a denial factor now, but it won't last."</TE>
<TE>   Another tension is between Vatican secrecy and American openness.</TE>
<TE>   When the scandals in America erupted, the Vatican first insisted that
it had already addressed the problem with a new requirement that all
accusations of clerical sexual abuse be reported to Rome.</TE>
<TE>   But these requirements, adopted last May, were issued in secret. They
were sent in June to bishops and heads of religious orders but not
publicly announced until January, when they were finally published in
Latin in the journal of record of the Holy See.</TE>
<TE>   Vatican officials struggling to grasp the impact of the scandals have
also displayed a lack of understanding of American civil law, which has
made financial liability a big issue.</TE>
<TE>   Archbishop Tarcisio Bertone of Italy, a Vatican official, called it a
"strange fact" that in the United States the church is forced under civil
law to pay millions of dollars in damages for the misdeeds of "single
individuals."</TE>
<TE>   "This ordinarily doesn't happen" in other societies, he said in an
interview with the Italian magazine 30 Giorni, "and it shouldn't happen."</TE>
<TE>   Another factor that blinded the Vatican to the American scandals was a
suspicion among curial officials that sex abuse allegations were being
orchestrated and reported by opponents of the church's strong stand
against abortion and birth control and its insistence on clerical
celibacy.</TE>
<TE>   It took weeks of insistent messages from American cardinals and
bishops to convince the Vatican that the scandals have severely eroded
the faith of ordinary Catholics and threaten to taint John Paul's reign.</TE>
<TE>   "The magnitude of this scandal has finally hit home here," said
Weigel, the theologian, who has spent the last three weeks in Rome. "The
urgency gap has finally begun to narrow."</TE>
<TE>   The two days of debate here will try to reconcile conflicting
perceptions over what to do about the scandal.</TE>
<TE>   In remarks over the weekend to visiting clergymen, John Paul
emphasized that Jesus demands a "higher loyalty" from priests, including
humility, poverty and chastity.</TE>
<TE>   Some American Catholics worry that the pope is framing the sex abuse
issue more as a matter of discipline by individual priests than as an
institutional failure. Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, archbishop of Los
Angeles, said he would plead in today's meeting for a papal apology to
the victims of clerical sex abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an institutional church issue," Mahony said in an interview.
"The pope has to say something that is very pastoral and caring to the
victims and to children and youth."</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, one U.S. cardinal told The Times that he and other prelates
planned to urge the Vatican in meetings Monday to ask Cardinal Bernard
Law to resign as the archbishop of Boston. Law has come under fire for
his handling of cases of pedophile priests. The cardinal offered no
progress report on Monday's meetings.</TE>
<TE>   As for what to do about pedophile priests, Sister Mary Ann Walsh, a
spokeswoman for the American bishops, said the bishops tend to favor a
chief executive's approach: "You do something wrong, you're fired."</TE>
<TE>   "But it's not that easy to dismiss someone from the priesthood," she
added, noting the Vatican view that once someone is ordained a priest, he
is a priest forever.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the American push for mandatory reporting policies--which would
require bishops to inform police of any credible allegations of sexual
abuse against a priest--has been met so far with a cautious response from
the Vatican.</TE>
<TE>   Society must "respect the 'professional secrecy' of priests," Bertone
said in the 30 Giorni interview. "If a priest cannot confide in his
bishop because he is afraid of being denounced . . . it would mean that
there is no more freedom of conscience."</TE>
<TE>   On one hand, the Americans see the Vatican's point. "It's one thing if
you're dealing with a constitutional government that believes in due
process and innocent until proven guilty," Walsh said. "If you're in a
dictatorial state, in China, I'm not sure whether you'd want the bishops
doing that."</TE>
<TE>   But Mahony said worldwide standards are essential in an age of
globalized missionary work. American dioceses often rely on foreign
priests, he said, yet often are not told by those priests' superiors when
one has a record of sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   If accused of sexual misbehavior in America, Mahony complained, such
priests have an easy out.</TE>
<TE>   "They get a dime and call a cab," he said. "They're gone."</TE>

<HD>Europe's Drift to the Right Is Seen as a Wake-Up Call for Democracy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN
</DL>
<LD>Hardly a soul believes that ultranationalist Jean-Marie Le Pen can
actually win the French presidency next month, but Europeans are
collectively shuddering at the rise of right-wing nationalists who are
playing on voters' fears of crime, unemployment and immigration.</LD>
<LD>   Europe may still be far from the pandemic despair that gave rise to
fascism in the 1930s. Today's sense of insecurity, however, is provoking
some comparisons to the brooding atmosphere that led to social upheaval,
dictatorship, atrocities and war.</LD>
<LD>   At minimum, the far right appears to be tapping into unhappiness over
deepening European integration, including increasingly open borders and
the introduction this year of a common currency in France and 11 other
countries.</LD>
<TE>   Alarmed by Le Pen's second-place finish in the first round of the
French presidential election Sunday, politicians across Europe cast the
outcome as a wake-up call for mainstream parties and leaders to defend
democracy against demagogues and opportunists.</TE>
<TE>   Although Le Pen, who once dismissed Nazi gas chambers as "a minor
detail in the history of World War II," is likely to be routed by
incumbent President Jacques Chirac in the May 5 runoff, far-right figures
have triumphed elsewhere in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   The xenophobic Freedom Party shares power in Austria, even though its
charismatic leader, Joerg Haider, has stepped down. In Denmark, voter
disaffection with left-of-center rule was galvanized by the strong
anti-immigration platform of the Danish People's Party, which also sits
in government.</TE>
<TE>   Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, a media magnate and no
friend of the left, governs the country with the support of the
right-wing National Alliance and Northern League.</TE>
<TE>   Mindful of the failed attempts at sanctioning Austrians for allowing
Haider's party into government in 2000, most European leaders were
restrained in their reactions to the news from France.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Le Pen's
besting of Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin was "very sad," adding
that in the runoff election, "we trust the French people to reject
extremism of any kind."</TE>
<TE>   "I hope that all democratic powers will unite against right-wing
extremism and xenophobia," Sweden's Social Democratic Prime Minister
Goran Persson said.</TE>
<TE>   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said: "It's very regrettable that
the extreme right has become so strong in France."</TE>
<TE>   Though widely lamenting Le Pen's success, many European analysts blame
the mainstream candidates--Chirac and Jospin--for failing to address
voters' worries and allowing Le Pen to set the agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "Jospin let himself be drawn into a campaign about 'internal
security,' and on that issue drifted so close to the right that there was
hardly any difference between their views," said Martin Koopmann, an
analyst with Berlin's Society for Foreign Policy think tank. "This
certainly damaged him, as voters in France--as in Germany--will always
choose the original over the copy."</TE>
<TE>   Crime is relatively low in most areas of Europe in comparison with the
United States. Unemployment, although in double digits in Germany, is due
more to rigid government labor regulation than an influx of cheap
immigrant workers. Still, politicians such as Le Pen have manipulated
those issues to convince voters that they are under threat from the
foreigners among them.</TE>
<TE>   "The current situation can't be compared to the 1930s, as one must see
from the economic data that France is in a rather good position,"
Koopmann argued.</TE>
<TE>   But others felt an ominous hint of recognition in the drift to the
right. In Greece, where fascist occupation during World War II left deep
scars on the national psyche, the daily Ta Nea wrote that "Europe freezes
as fascism rises" and likened the spread of far-right influence to
"resurrection of the vampire" that drained the continent's lifeblood
during the Holocaust.</TE>
<TE>   Greek government spokesman Christos Protopappas told the
Eleftherotypia newspaper that Le Pen's showing represented "a danger for
democracy, social cohesion and the prospects for Europe."</TE>
<TE>   Franco Pavoncello, a professor at Rome's John Cabot University, argued
that today's right-wing threat bears little resemblance to the one that
gave rise to fascism.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see here Mussolini and Hitler," Pavoncello said of modern
European nationalists, although he conceded that anti-immigrant
sentiments are a genuine problem.</TE>
<TE>   In Israel, where the legacy of the Holocaust serves to keep many
attuned to emerging threats in Europe, Interior Minister Eli Yishai
warned Jews across Europe about the risks of complacency in the face of
growing anti-Semitism. He urged French Jews to emigrate to Israel,
arguing that Le Pen's strong showing was "an expression of the
anti-Semitic processes and attempts at Holocaust denial that are taking
place not only in France but all throughout Europe."</TE>
<TE>   But left-wing opposition leader Yossi Sarid told the Haaretz newspaper
that Israelis were being hypocritical in their attitude toward France,
when "we aren't disturbed when we see it happen in our country." Sarid
was alluding to government efforts to cut social assistance to Arab
citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Most disturbing for many Europeans was the resistance to deeper
European integration that Le Pen appears to be tapping. Even before the
French vote was fully counted, Le Pen was calling for reconsideration of
"this Europe of Maastricht." He was referring to the intensifying
integration of economies and politics set out in the European Union's
landmark 1992 treaty, including the introduction of the euro currency.</TE>
<TE>   "I am extremely worried by certain stances which might involve a
racist or xenophobic element, but I am also worried to a large extent by
certain stances which run completely counter to the construction of
Europe," said Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Pique, whose country holds
the rotating EU presidency.</TE>
<TE>   Newspaper commentaries condemned the French vote as a setback for
democracy, integration and social peace.</TE>
<TE>   "It calls into question not only the commitment of French voters to
the values of civilized multiculturalism, but also a system of democracy
that has let this happen," said The Times of London.</TE>
<TE>   Poland's Gazeta Wyborcza called the election results a "catastrophe"
and predicted that "those invoking populism, demagogy, nationalism and
racism will now feel the wind beneath their wings."</TE>
<TE>   Far-right leaders leaped eagerly to applaud Le Pen's success as proof
that their own nationalist aims are achievable.</TE>
<TE>   Le Pen's advance will encourage all those fighting the political
establishment, Serbian Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj proclaimed in
a congratulatory letter.</TE>
<TE>   Russian ultra-nationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky also celebrated Le
Pen's performance, an encore of his own startling rise in the early
1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "People are tired of loose democracy, which gives birth to crime and
large-scale migration," Zhirinovsky told the Interfax news agency,
describing Le Pen as "a great patriot."</TE>

<HD>Moussaoui Says He Prays for U.S. Ruin</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: In a startling court appearance, he also strikes out at
Jews and the legal system.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.
</DL>
<LD>A defiant Zacarias Moussaoui--the only person charged in the United
States with terrorism in connection with the Sept. 11 attacks--told a
judge Monday that he wants to represent himself in a trial without a
jury, and called for the destruction of America and Jews everywhere.</LD>
<LD>   Moussaoui's fiery remarks appeared to surprise even his own
court-appointed defense team. They came during what was supposed to be a
routine hearing before U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in federal
court near Washington.</LD>
<LD>   But the hearing quickly became anything but routine as Moussaoui, a
French militant of Moroccan descent, insisted on addressing the judge. He
then launched into a calm but forceful hourlong discourse about his
unfair treatment in custody, and how his own lawyers are part of a
conspiracy to convict him and sentence him to death.</LD>
<TE>   Brinkema had set the hearing to discuss Moussaoui's complaints about
oppressive prison conditions, including a cramped, overly bright cell and
the lack of a computer to read the volumes of government evidence in the
case. On Monday, Moussaoui repeated those complaints.</TE>
<TE>   But as his lawyers sat silently beside him, Moussaoui, 33, went on to
describe himself as "a slave to Allah" and called upon Allah to vanquish
the non-Muslim forces in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui also vowed repeatedly to vigorously oppose the U.S. effort
to convict and execute him for allegedly conspiring with Osama bin Laden,
the 19 hijackers and others in the attacks against the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   "America, I am ready to fight . . . even with both hands tied behind
my back," Moussaoui said in heavily accented English, noting that the
United States already has spent millions of its "haram, or evil money, to
kill me."</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui, who has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiring to
commit terrorism, apparently startled the veteran judge by asking for a
nonjury trial. Brinkema said she wasn't even sure it was constitutionally
possible in a case where the federal government is seeking to execute
someone.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to waive a trial by jury?" Brinkema asked the diminutive
Moussaoui, who wore a dark green jumpsuit with "Prisoner" on the back.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," replied Moussaoui, standing at a lectern and facing her.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether it is even possible in a federal capital [punishment] case,
we haven't even looked at it," Brinkema said.</TE>
<TE>Judge Yields on Some Requests</TE>
<TE>   Later, after consulting with defense attorneys and prosecutors, the
judge agreed that it was possible for Moussaoui not only to represent
himself but to seek a nonjury trial in which she would hear the evidence.
Brinkema, a former federal prosecutor, would then decide on Moussaoui's
guilt or innocence and determine whether to spare his life on any of four
criminal counts that could bring the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Brinkema reserved judgment on all of those issues, saying she wanted
Moussaoui to undergo a mental competency test first to determine whether
he should be allowed to give up his right to court-appointed lawyers. She
also said the federal government would need to support a nonjury trial as
well, and she asked prosecutors to prepare a response. And she announced
that Moussaoui would get his computer and have the other prison-condition
issues resolved.</TE>
<TE>   Outside court, federal prosecutors had no comment on the day's
proceedings. Neither did Moussaoui's three court-appointed defense
lawyers. As they left the courtroom together, the head of the defense
team, Frank Dunham Jr., quipped to a colleague outside, "We just got
fired."</TE>
<TE>   Former Deputy Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. said he was surprised at
Moussaoui's requests.</TE>
<TE>   "You are talking about a defendant representing himself in a capital
case; this is the ultimate roll of the dice on any number of levels,"
Holder said. "Moussaoui has really complicated an already complicated
case."</TE>
<TE>   On one hand, a judge would probably be more inclined than a jury to
cut through the emotion-laden legal arguments of a Sept. 11-related
prosecution and decide the case solely on the evidence, said Holder, a
former federal prosecutor and judge. As the former No. 2 person in the
Justice Department, Holder said, he supervised Brinkema and found her to
be particularly good at discarding emotion in favor of evidence.</TE>
<TE>   That could prove critically important for Moussaoui, whom some
authorities believe may have been chosen by Bin Laden's Al Qaeda network
to be the 20th hijacker.</TE>
<TE>   So far, however, authorities have provided no proof in a public forum
that Moussaoui ever met any of the 19 hijackers or other alleged
co-conspirators. What's more, Moussaoui had been taken into custody on
immigration violations three weeks before the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But Holder said a jury of 12 might be less inclined than a judge to
vote to execute Moussaoui. "You just need one member of the jury to find
that the death penalty is not appropriate," Holder said.</TE>
<TE>   At the hearing, Moussaoui's beard and hair were much longer than at
his previous court appearances. As he spoke, he gripped the lectern with
both hands while three federal marshals hovered behind him.</TE>
<TE>   He began by reading from a letter complaining about his lawyers that
he said he had tried unsuccessfully to send to the judge last month. He
mixed extemporaneous remarks with citations from U.S. case law and the
Koran.</TE>
<TE>   Even with such legal knowledge, representing himself at trial is a
risky strategy at best. Even Brinkema told Moussaoui he should keep his
defense team on in an advisory capacity at the very least, because of the
enormously complicated nature of the case.</TE>
<TE>   But by representing himself, Moussaoui would be able to run the case
as he chooses.</TE>
<TE>May Use Court as 'Propaganda Vehicle'</TE>
<TE>   "If this guy was truly prepared to die on Sept. 11 for his cause, he
may seek to convert this trial, to the extent that he can, into a
propaganda vehicle for his cause in a way that his lawyers would not
allow him to," Holder said.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui appeared to be doing just that for much of the hearing
Monday morning, which occurred just miles from the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui lashed out repeatedly at his three lawyers, all of them
veteran defense attorneys, saying they were in league with prosecutors
from the "U.S. Department of so-called Justice" in acts of serious
misconduct against him.</TE>
<TE>   "Greed, fame and vanity is their motivation," Moussaoui told the
judge. "Their game is deception."</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui did not specify his problems with the lawyers, saying simply
that he wanted a Muslim lawyer to at least aid him in his defense. He
wanted someone, he said, "with knowledge of what is the Muslim scene, the
moujahedeen scene, what you call the terrorist scene, somebody who is
able to quickly understand what I am talking about."</TE>
<TE>   In brief remarks in court, defense attorney Dunham told the judge, "I
think our view of things might be a little different, but we do
understand the lack of trust that the individual has had in us from the
beginning. We've tried hard to earn" that trust.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui also criticized Brinkema and President Bush, calling the
judge "a field general, entrusted with the mission to get this matter
over quickly. Every general has a commander in chief, and I know how much
the U.S. commander in chief wants me to be over quickly."</TE>
<TE>No Formal Legal Training</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui was enrolled in a graduate program at London's South Bank
University, where he studied international business, but he has no formal
legal training.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui, who attended a radical mosque in London, also called upon
Allah to establish Muslim control over much of Asia, Africa, Europe and
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "I pray to Allah . . . for the destruction of the Jewish people and
states and for the liberation of Palestine by the Muslim, for the
Muslim," Moussaoui said.</TE>
<TE>   After praying for the destruction of Russia and non-Muslim rulers of
Chechnya, he added: "I pray to Allah, the powerful, for the return of the
Islamic Emirates of Afghanistan and the destruction of the United States
of America."</TE>

<HD>Telecom Slump Gets Deeper Amid New Layoffs, Cutbacks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN KAPLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The beleaguered telecommunications industry suffered another blow
Monday as wireless equipment manufacturer Ericsson announced 17,000 new
layoffs and Lucent Technologies Inc., the world's largest maker of
telecom gear, said it would eliminate an additional 6,000 jobs--a rout
that is beginning to rival the dot-com meltdown of the last two years.</LD>
<LD>   Telecom stocks also were battered by the news that WorldCom Inc., the
nation's No. 2 long-distance company, cut its revenue forecast for the
year by 5.4%. Investors slashed shares of WorldCom by one-third Monday,
erasing $5.8 billion from the market value of MCI's parent company.</LD>
<LD>   The developments continued the latest streak of bad news that has
swept through the telecommunications industry since companies began
warning of weak quarterly earnings a few weeks ago. The grim signs
suggest that a new round of layoffs and cutbacks is in the offing.</LD>
<TE>   To the Wall Street analysts monitoring the industry, the current
hardships among companies that offer phone services and the manufacturers
that supply them threaten to surpass the dot-com bust in scope and scale.
Already, the telecom industry has shed more than 403,000 workers since
the beginning of 2001, which easily surpasses the approximately 145,000
dot-com jobs lost since December 1999, according to outplacement firm
Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   And analysts offer little hope of near-term recovery because the
telecom firms come at the end of the corporate food chain. They depend on
orders from other businesses, which have been wary about investing in new
communications systems since the economy began to slump in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been a very disheartening day," said John Gonsalves, a vice
president with Adventis, a management consulting firm in Boston that
focuses on the communications industry. "This is all driven by demand,
and that is generated from the enterprise [business] sector. Jitters in
the psychology cascade downhill. Enterprise spending drives service
provider spending, which drives equipment provider revenue, so it's all
linked."</TE>
<TE>   Just as the rise of the Internet prompted massive investments in shaky
start-ups that ultimately failed, the deregulation ushered in by the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 spawned a new generation of firms that are
now going out of business--and dragging the rest of the industry with
them.</TE>
<TE>   "The Telecom Act created a telecom bubble," said Pat Comack, a telecom
analyst at Guzman &amp; Co. in Miami. "We're seeing the ramifications of that
right now."</TE>
<TE>   Though many industries are showing signs of recovery this year, the
telecom sector tends to lag the overall economy, and it could sink
further before hitting bottom.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, firms including cell phone giant Nokia, Baby Bell SBC
Communications Inc., equipment supplier Nortel Networks Corp., and local
and long-distance service provider Qwest Communications International
Inc. offered gloomy sales forecasts and said they would each cut hundreds
or thousands of jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts liken the current telecom crisis to a perfect storm. The
industry was already struggling under massive debt after spending at
least $50 billion to cover the globe with fiber-optic communications
networks. Technological advances increased the capacity of those networks
far faster than demand from businesses and consumers materialized,
driving prices into a death spiral that made the debt all the more
burdensome.</TE>
<TE>   "We are witnessing unprecedented events in telecom," said Cary
Robinson, senior research analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray in
Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Ericsson, the world's biggest manufacturer of equipment used to build
cell phone networks, on Monday abandoned its projections to eke out a
small profit this year and instead said 2002 would be its second straight
year of losses. Chief Executive Kurt Hellstrom said the Stockholm-based
firm will continue to suffer because wireless network operators recently
decided to make additional cuts in their own investment plans.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Ericsson will lay off nearly 20% of its work force,
wiping out about 17,000 jobs. The reductions will be made worldwide and
will be concentrated among employees engaged in development activities.</TE>
<TE>   About 7,000 of the cuts will be made by year's end, with the balance
coming in 2003. Ericsson's American shares dropped 80 cents, or 23%, to
close at $2.74 in Nasdaq trading Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Across the Atlantic, U.S. telecom equipment maker Lucent said Monday
it lost money for the eighth straight quarter despite a modest uptick in
revenue. The Murray Hill, N.J.-based company has already trimmed its
payroll from 123,000 in January 2001 to about 56,000 today. An additional
6,000 jobs are scheduled to be shed before its fiscal year ends Sept. 30,
and Chief Executive Patricia Russo warned that the cuts could be even
deeper. Shares of Lucent rose 20 cents, or 4.6%, to close at $4.49 on the
New York Stock Exchange on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom shares plunged to their lowest level in almost a decade
during Nasdaq trading Monday, the first day of trading since the Clinton,
Miss., company lowered its sales forecasts for 2002.</TE>
<TE>   The news affected the entire sector because WorldCom is considered the
most admired long-distance company. WorldCom was the most active stock in
U.S. markets Monday and had the fifth-busiest trading day ever for a U.S.
stock. The shares ended the day at $4.01, down $1.97.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors are wondering, 'Is this the bottom? Is this where the
uptick starts?' " Gonsalves said.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't think so. Gonsalves said he expects the continuing shakeout
to throw a handful of companies into Bankruptcy Court, joining legions of
start-ups such as Global Crossing Ltd. The restructurings firms are
promising to avoid that fate will inevitably lead to further layoffs, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Monday night, Williams Communications Group announced it has filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The move is part of the company's plan
to restructure $5.9 billion in debt amassed in constructing a 33,000-mile
fiber-optic network transmitting video, voice and data signals. Williams
shares have fallen 96% over the last year to trade at 17 cents a share in
over-the-counter trading.</TE>

<HD>Gates Takes Stand for Microsoft</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<AU>MICHAEL A. HILTZIK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Trying to shed his image as ruthless and aloof, a smiling and
confident Bill Gates strode into a federal courtroom here Monday to
fend off tough antitrust punishment and repudiate Microsoft's
reputation as a business bully.</LD>
<LD>   The software giant's chairman, the world's richest man, took the
witness stand for the first time in the landmark antitrust case and
warned that punishment sought by nine states suing his company would
cripple Microsoft and hurt the entire computer industry.</LD>
<LD>   Accompanied to court by his wife, Melinda French Gates, and a small
security detail, the software mogul was by turns cheerful, confident and
testy on the witness stand before a packed courtroom. The appearance of
the brilliant but volatile Gates was considered a risky legal maneuver,
but observers said it seemed to pay off.</LD>
<TE>   Appearing as Microsoft's seventh witness, Gates, 46, sparred with
states lawyer Steve Kuney, who tried to show that Gates exaggerated the
potential effect of punishment being sought by the District of Columbia,
California and eight other states suing Microsoft for antitrust
violations.</TE>
<TE>   But Gates kept his composure through more than three hours of tough
cross-examination. More important, presiding U.S. District Judge Colleen
Kollar-Kotelly appeared to pay close attention to the software executive,
taking frequent notes and turning to look directly at Gates while he
testified.</TE>
<TE>'The End of Innovation'</TE>
<TE>   Under cross-examination by Kuney, Gates said the states' proposed
remedies would "mean the end of innovation and the elimination of most
employees at Microsoft." Asked by Kuney if he understood the seriousness
of the consequences of the government's proposed sanctions on his
company, Gates said he viewed the trial and its outcome "as a significant
situation, certainly one that could have a significant impact on the
company," and added that his company had ceased the anti-competitive
conduct that it was found guilty of two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Gates' courtroom appearance supplemented a 156-page written submission
in which the company, under his name, assailed the proposed remedies as a
straitjacket that would destroy the utility of Windows, undermine
Microsoft's corporate viability and stifle innovation across a wide
spectrum of software development.</TE>
<TE>   The states refused to sign on to a settlement between Microsoft and
the Justice Department last fall. Among other penalties, the states want
Microsoft to make public the millions of lines of "source code" that
power Windows.</TE>
<TE>   Proposals like that, according to Gates, "would turn back the
clock on Windows development by about 10 years and effectively freeze
it there." Competitors, by contrast, would have the unfettered right
"to add new cutting-edge features to their products." The "practical
effect," Gates' statement said, "would be to cripple Microsoft as a
technology company."</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the company said that much of the written testimony
repeated arguments that Microsoft had made unsuccessfully at earlier
stages of the trial. "Microsoft's strategy is to re-litigate the
parts of the case they have already lost," said Roger G. Noll,
professor of public policy at Stanford's graduate school of business.</TE>
<TE>   Noll also dismissed Gates' contention that some of the states'
proposals would permanently undermine the usefulness of Windows.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue," Noll said, "is whether it's really going to reduce
innovation in all software markets if you don't let Microsoft innovate as
it wants to."</TE>
<TE>   By day's end, backslapping Microsoft lawyers appeared jubilant that
their calculated risk to put Gates on the witness stand did not backfire.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he made his case well," said one Microsoft official. "He
showed he was more familiar with the states' proposal than they were."</TE>
<TE>   Armed with what seemed like an encyclopedic memory of the states'
proposals, Gates battled politely with his questioner down to the tiniest
points. At one point, he argued over the word "interoperate."</TE>
<TE>   Howard University law professor Andrew Gavil said the Microsoft
chairman had succeeded in presenting a "kinder and gentler Bill than was
present in the first trial."</TE>
<TE>   Gates "didn't lose his cool," added Robert H. Lande, a University of
Baltimore law professor, who has been sympathetic to the states'
antitrust case. "This is a real departure from the Bill Gates we usually
see."</TE>
<TE>Gates to Continue Testimony Today</TE>
<TE>   Gates will return to the witness stand to resume testifying today. And
it remains to be seen whether he will fully overcome the damaging effects
of his 1998 videotaped deposition in which he appeared aloof, forgetful
and defensive.</TE>
<TE>   In that video, Gates slouched in a chair and repeatedly said he could
not recall key corporate events. But government lawyers contradicted the
claims at the time by introducing incriminating e-mails and other
documents that showed that Gates had direct knowledge of many of the
company's efforts to crush business rivals.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft lawyers never indicated why they did not call Gates to the
witness stand during the antitrust trial with the U.S. Justice Department
that began in October 1998. But Gates' absence at that proceeding and his
performance in his videotaped deposition riled U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson, who--after ordering a breakup of Microsoft--likened
Gates to Napoleon.</TE>
<TE>   In June, the U.S. Court of Appeals overturned Jackson's breakup order
but upheld his ruling that Microsoft used its flagship Windows software
to illegally maintain a monopoly in personal computer operating systems.
In November, the company reached an out-of-court settlement with the
Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft stock closed down $1.61 at $55.59 in Nasdaq trading. Gates
is worth $35.85 billion.</TE>

<DH>Philippines: President orders crackdown in the wake of deadly
bombings. Two are arrested in the attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HONG KONG
</DL>
<LD>One day after a series of bombings left 14 people dead and about 60
others injured in the southern Philippines, President Gloria Macapagal
Arroyo vowed Monday to fight terrorism and ordered a crackdown on those
suspected of trying to destabilize the region.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a crime against the Filipino people," she said of the
bombings. "This evil will not go unpunished."</LD>
<LD>   The president's comments came in a statement issued hours after she
made a brief and nervous visit to the scene of Sunday's mayhem in the
southern port city of General Santos. Shortly before Arroyo's arrival, a
bomb exploded in a boat offshore, but no injuries were reported.</LD>
<TE>   In a major police sweep, two suspects have been detained in connection
with Sunday's bombings, regional police commander Bartolome Baluyot said.
Both are said to be members of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the
largest separatist group fighting to create an independent Muslim
homeland in the southern Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   The rebel group's vice chairman for military affairs, Murad Ibrahim,
denied any involvement in the bombings and condemned attacks against
civilians as anti-Islamic.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman claiming to represent the Abu Sayyaf extremist group told
a Mindanao radio station that members of his organization had carried out
the attack and vowed that more bombings would follow. The man said the
bombings were in retaliation for the government-led offensive against the
group on the southern island of Basilan.</TE>
<TE>   "The government is looking down on us and has been saying that Abu
Sayyaf is now a spent force, and they are wrong," the spokesman said.
"Until we get what we want, we will not stop."</TE>
<TE>   The Abu Sayyaf also claims to be fighting for an independent Muslim
homeland, but the group has in recent years busied itself more with
kidnapping for ransom. It currently holds hostage a Filipina nurse named
Deborah Yap and an American missionary couple, Martin and Gracia Burnham
of Kansas.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. intelligence sources believe that the Abu Sayyaf is linked with
Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network. The Bush administration
dispatched more than 600 U.S. troops this year to help train, advise and
support the Philippine military in operations to crush the guerrilla
group. With the help of sophisticated American technology, Philippine
units on Basilan have sharply increased pressure on the group but so far
have been unable to wipe it out or free the hostages.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 340 American troops began arriving on Basilan on Friday
to help repair roads, improve port facilities and carry out other
construction projects.</TE>
<TE>   Arroyo reportedly considered declaring a state of emergency Monday in
the wake of the bombings the day before, but she pulled back because of
possible political repercussions. Some observers have argued that such a
move would violate the constitution, while Muslim groups expressed
concern that she might use sweeping powers of arrest and seizure to
launch indiscriminate operations.</TE>
<TE>   There also were fears that such a move might scare off badly needed
foreign investment.</TE>
<TE>   "It's things like this that make it difficult to win investors back,"
said Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Miguel Varela.</TE>

<HD>German Official Confirms Tunisia Blast Was Attack</HD>
<DH>Probe: After a visit to temple on Djerba and talks with
counterparts, interior minister returns and calls deadly explosion an act
of terrorism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN
</DL>
<LD>Germany's interior minister confirmed Monday that an explosion at a
synagogue in Tunisia that killed 16 people earlier this month was the
work of terrorists, not an accident, as local authorities had insisted.</LD>
<LD>   After meeting with officials in Tunis and inspecting the evidence,
Interior Minister Otto Schily said he had concluded "with 100% certainty"
that the attack on the Tunisian island of Djerba in which 11 German
tourists died was deliberate and the result of international
collaboration.</LD>
<LD>   German media have reported that police traced cell phone calls made
between the Djerba assailant and associates in Germany, including claims
of a possible connection between the attacker and a suspected accomplice
of three Sept. 11 hijackers.</LD>
<TE>   Tunisia's leaders initially ruled the April 11 explosion of a
gas-laden truck at the Ghriba synagogue, North Africa's oldest, "a tragic
accident" and began immediate repair work. But after survivors among the
German tour groups visiting the synagogue at the time of the blast told
investigators that they saw the driver get out of the truck just before
it exploded, Schily called on the Tunisian government to probe the matter
further.</TE>
<TE>   Schily traveled to Tunis, the capital, over the weekend, before
visiting the explosion site Sunday and laying flowers in memory of the
victims, who also included French and Tunisian citizens. On Monday, he
met with Tunisian President Zine el Abidine ben Ali. After those talks,
Schily told Germany's ARD television that both governments are now
convinced that the explosion was an act of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear from the way the truck was loaded, from the way the
explosion was set off, from the kinds of substances found at the scene,"
said Schily, a lawyer who once represented accused terrorists of the Red
Army Faction. He said further investigation is necessary to determine who
or what organization was behind the attack but said there is already
"considerable evidence" of the involvement of several people.</TE>
<TE>   German police briefly detained a German convert to radical Islam in
the western German city of Duisburg a week ago after investigators traced
calls to him from the truck driver, a 25-year-old Tunisian with a family
in Lyon, France, who is believed to have died in the bombing.</TE>
<TE>   According to the respected Sueddeutsche Zeitung daily, the suspected
attacker, identified as Nizar Nawar, called the Duisburg man and asked
him, "Pray for me." The Duisburg man was under police surveillance even
before the Djerba attack for known involvement in extremist circles,
investigators have said. But he was released for lack of evidence to hold
him.</TE>
<TE>   The issue of Der Spiegel magazine that hit newsstands Monday and
Berlin's Tagesspiegel newspaper reported that the search of an apartment
belonging to a Moroccan friend of the Duisburg man turned up the Hamburg
telephone number of Ramzi Binalshibh, 29. That Yemeni is one of three
fugitives sought for allegedly providing logistical support to the three
Sept. 11 hijackers who plotted their attacks in Hamburg.</TE>
<TE>   German media, citing anonymous intelligence sources, also have
reported suspected links between the Djerba attacker and his associates
and Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   Tunisian authorities have pledged unfettered assistance in the
reopened investigation, Schily said.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with the Bild am Sonntag newspaper a day earlier,
Tunisian Tourism Minister Mondher Zenaidi denied that his government had
sought to steer investigators away from a terrorism conclusion to shield
the country's tourism-dependent economy.</TE>
<TE>   "At no point was anything hushed up," Zenaidi said. "The first results
of the investigation pointed to an accident."</TE>

<HD>Chechens Report Abuses Despite Safeguards</HD>
<DH>Caucasus: Claims of beatings, looting and killings surface shortly
after the Russian military announces rules to prevent such acts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>Less than two weeks after announcing new safeguards to prevent
abuses, the Russian military launched a large-scale operation in Chechnya
that was marked by beatings, looting, electric shock torture and at least
two extrajudicial killings, residents and human rights workers say.</LD>
<LD>   The rules announced March 29, known as Order 80, were supposed to
prevent abuses by allowing local officials to observe operations and
requiring soldiers to identify themselves and keep public lists of
detainees.</LD>
<LD>   "I was very hopeful about Order 80, but my hopes were short-lived,"
Malika Umazheva, 54, mayor of the Chechen town of Alkhan-Kala, said.
"They didn't let me or any other representative of the administration or
of the council of elders accompany the soldiers."</LD>
<TE>   Moreover, Umazheva said, she was manipulated into signing a document
certifying that there had been no human rights violations, and that once
the document was signed, the abuses intensified. At least two residents
were reported shot and killed in the operation, which began April 11.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Russia's human rights representative for Chechnya, Viktor
Kalamanov, was quoted by the Itar-Tass news agency as saying that Russian
servicemen were complying with the new rules, that local officials and
elders have observed every operation, and that there had been no
complaints about human rights violations.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights voted down
a motion to censure Russia for violations in Chechnya; 22 of 53 countries
on the commission abstained. As a result, the U.N. body is no longer
required to report regularly on the human rights situation in the
breakaway republic.</TE>
<TE>   Russian troops reoccupied Chechnya in 2000, and they try to keep local
residents from assisting the rebels, who defeated the Russians in a
1994-96 war. In particular, they search for rebels hidden among
residents. It is during such searches, sometimes called zachistka
operations, that many abuses reportedly occur.</TE>
<TE>   Russian officials have claimed that some of the abuses are actually
committed by rebels who disguise themselves as Russian servicemen. Last
week, the top civilian prosecutor in Chechnya, Vsevolod Chernov, said
that 161 crimes in which federal servicemen were originally blamed turned
out to have been committed by Chechen rebels.</TE>
<TE>   Umazheva said soldiers entered Alkhan-Kala, a town of 20,000, April
11, apparently in response to the killing of three pro-Moscow Chechen
policemen the previous day. She and the elders approached the commander
and a military prosecutor and asked to observe the operation but were
rebuffed, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Zalna Magomadova said soldiers entered her yard April 12 and began
beating her husband, 67-year-old Alkhazur.</TE>
<TE>   "I rushed to them and gave them his passport for them to see how old
he is," she said in an interview. "When the soldiers looked at the
passport they began to talk among themselves, and one of them said, 'We
got the wrong guy.' They didn't even bother to identify the person they
wanted to arrest--they just began beating him, never mind fulfilling
Order 80.</TE>
<TE>   "When this order was first announced, we had some hope that the
situation would improve," she added. "Now the hope is gone. Nothing has
changed."</TE>
<TE>   By the second day, the mayor said, she had received reports from
residents of the detentions of about 20 men and many instances of
beatings and looting. She approached the general and prosecutor again and
asked about the fate of the arrested. Because of her entreaties, 15 of
the detained were released.</TE>
<TE>   "The prosecutor then asked me to sign a document that the zachistka
was conducted in an orderly manner without any violations of human
rights," Umazheva said. "I told him that I wouldn't sign this document
because human rights were violated."</TE>
<TE>   But then the prosecutor said that if she signed the paper, the
soldiers would leave immediately, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I consulted with the elders," she said. "It was already the third day
of the zachistka. People were suffering. Children couldn't go to school.
Sick people couldn't go to the hospital. People couldn't take their
cattle and sheep out into the fields. So it was decided that I should
sign this document to make the soldiers leave the village."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, she said, the paper she signed was blank.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, the soldiers reentered the village. According to a
report compiled by the Russian human rights group Memorial, they searched
for some of the detainees who had already been released. They found one,
30-year-old Ilyas Utsiyev, in bed. His family told Memorial that he had
been beaten and subjected to electric shocks; his body was covered with
bruises and burns.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers locked the women in a room and shot Utsiyev as he lay in
the bed, according to Memorial. The women watched as the soldiers spent
several hours in their backyard, carrying in weapons that they then
pretended to find and videotaping the alleged discovery. They also took a
sack of flour from the shed and announced it was explosives.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said she went to the general to demand an explanation.</TE>
<TE>   "The general showed me a pile of weapons which he said they had
confiscated from Utsiyev. I started arguing, telling him that it is not
true because they didn't allow impartial observers to be present during
the search," she said. "Then the general admitted that the weapons were
found not in Utsiyev's yard, but on the territory of the local mill."</TE>
<TE>   Memorial said a man named Vakha Shakhabov, who was detained for two
days and released April 12, returned home with bloody bruises and hearing
loss allegedly from electric shocks. Soldiers arrived at his house the
next day, family members told Memorial, pulled him from his bed, began to
kick him, and then locked his room door. Inside, they heard gunfire, and
Shakhabov was killed.</TE>
<TE>   Word of the attacks spread in the town, according to Memorial, and
other freed detainees fled.</TE>
<TE>   On April 15, Russian soldiers dumped a headless, handless body by the
town mosque, and later in the day, residents found two more corpses on
the town outskirts, Memorial said, adding that no one in the town
identified the bodies.</TE>
<TE>   "The military are a state within a state. They don't want to obey any
orders," said Tatiana Kasatkina, executive director of Memorial.</TE>
<TE>   Umazheva identified the Russian commander as Gen. Igor B. Bronevitsky
and the prosecutor as Alexander N. Ferlevsky. A spokesman for the
military prosecutor's office responsible for Chechnya said Ferlevsky was
on assignment in Chechnya and unreachable by telephone.</TE>

<LD>The head of a global chemical weapons control body was ousted by a
U.S.-sponsored vote provoked by a rift over his diplomatic overtures to
secure Iraq's compliance on arms inspection.</LD>
<LD>   The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which has
145 member states, voted to remove Brazilian Director General Jose
Bustani at a meeting in The Hague after the U.S. forced a vote.</LD>
<LD>   Bustani had urged Iraq to join the OPCW. But Washington has signaled
it wants to get rid of President Saddam Hussein's government, and it
could find it difficult to win backing for military action if Iraq agreed
to join the OPCW and admit arms inspectors, analysts say.</LD>

<HD>Bush Visit in the Cards for China's Heir Apparent</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Enigmatic vice president departs for a trip that
includes a week in the U.S. at a time when ties are shaky.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING
</DL>
<LD>The man expected to take over as leader of the world's most
populous nation left today on a diplomatic tour that will bring him to
Washington and a probable meeting with President Bush.</LD>
<LD>   Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao is scheduled to stop in Singapore and
Malaysia before traveling to the U.S. on Saturday for a weeklong visit
that will allow American officials to take further measure of the man
nearly everyone believes will succeed President Jiang Zemin within a
year.</LD>
<LD>   Hu's visit comes as Sino-U.S. relations, which enjoyed a revival after
Bush came to China in February, have hit another rocky patch over what
Beijing perceives to be an alarming tilt by the Bush administration
toward Taiwan.</LD>
<TE>   The subject of Taiwan is likely to dominate Hu's agenda in Washington,
which includes an expected meeting with Bush, who invited the vice
president to the U.S. while in Beijing. The men met for the first time
then, chatting briefly before Bush delivered a speech at Hu's alma mater,
Qinghua University.</TE>
<TE>   The Chinese government has been disturbed in recent weeks by a White
House decision to allow Taiwan's defense minister to visit the U.S., by
Bush's reference to the island as the "Republic of Taiwan" and by the
administration's support for Taiwan's entry into the World Health
Organization. China regards Taiwan as a renegade province.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing has made its displeasure known by summoning the U.S.
ambassador and refusing to allow an American naval ship to dock in Hong
Kong this month. There had been talk that Hu might even cancel his trip
to the U.S., which includes stops in Honolulu and San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   In a rare effort to explain Beijing's actions to the public, China's
state-run media published a detailed defense last week of the
government's decision to send Hu to Washington as planned.</TE>
<TE>   The China News Service said Bush's desire to meet with Hu and with
Jiang, who is to visit the U.S. in October, "deserves affirmation." The
invitations "show that the Bush administration wishes to continue
high-level contacts with China and has not gotten to the point of acting
with total disregard for bilateral relations. . . . Since the visit will
be good for communication, why shouldn't China go ahead with it?"</TE>
<TE>   The commentary blamed Bush's "pro-Taiwan posture" on hawks within his
Cabinet. "China will certainly not just accommodate and tolerate
America's 'pro-Taiwan' leanings," the article said.</TE>
<TE>   However, it said that there was no indication of a long-term shift in
U.S. policy toward Taiwan and that Beijing would focus on "the big
picture."</TE>
<TE>   The comments reflected what many see as the realization here that
stable ties with the U.S. are crucial to China's continued economic
development. Many Chinese analysts, and evidently some leaders, believe
that their country has little choice but to grit its collective teeth and
stay on Washington's good side.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Taiwan, Beijing is worried about Washington's extended
reach in Central Asia as a result of its war on terrorism. Although China
has gone on record in support of that campaign and has used it to
suppress Muslim dissent on its western fringes, some members of the
political establishment fear the U.S. presence in the Communist regime's
backyard.</TE>
<TE>   They also bristled at Bush's characterization of Iran and North Korea,
two countries with which China has good relations, as members of an "axis
of evil." Partly to position China as a counterweight to the U.S., Jiang
conducted a diplomatic tour of African and Middle Eastern countries,
including Libya, another nation the Bush administration views with
suspicion.</TE>
<TE>   Little is known about Hu, 59, except for the bare facts of his quick
ascent to his status as China's No. 5 leader.</TE>
<TE>   Observers have been trying hard to glean information about Hu ever
since his elevation in 1992 to the Politburo by the late paramount
leader, Deng Xiaoping, which appeared to seal Hu as heir apparent to
Jiang. Hu is expected to succeed Jiang as party general secretary this
fall and then as president next spring.</TE>

<HD>Hungary's Probable Premier Thinks Big, With Russia in Mind</HD>
<DH>Europe: Peter Medgyessy says he'll be able to fulfill his expensive
campaign promises. He wants to re-kindle ties with Moscow.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUDAPEST, Hungary
</DL>
<LD>The former Communist and banker poised to be Hungary's next prime
minister began talks with political allies Monday on the details of a new
center-left coalition government and called for better ties with Russia.</LD>
<LD>   Peter Medgyessy, whom the Hungarian Socialist Party picked as its
candidate even though he has never joined the party, also declared that
he can fulfill expensive campaign promises.</LD>
<LD>   The Socialists joined forces with the Alliance of Free Democrats in
elections Sunday that gave them control of parliament and the power to
form the next government. But they still must agree on how to share
Cabinet positions.</LD>
<TE>   The Socialists won 178 seats in the 386-seat parliament, while the
Free Democrats took 20. Parties of the current governing
coalition--FiDeSz-Hungarian Civic Party and the Hungarian Democratic
Forum--ran with a joint list of candidates and took 188 seats.</TE>
<TE>   Joining the European Union in 2004 will be a top priority for the
incoming government, as it was for the outgoing center-right government
of Prime Minister Viktor Orban. But Medgyessy and Socialist Party
President Laszlo Kovacs said at a news conference Monday that they want
to improve relations with Russia too. Both were Communist Party members
when Hungary was under Soviet domination.</TE>
<TE>'A Question of Style,' Socialist Leader Says</TE>
<TE>   "This is not really a question of content--it is more a question of
style," Kovacs said, taking a political swipe at what critics saw as a
nationalist tone to Orban's dealings with other countries in the region.
"If Hungary does not try to act like a power with respect to Russia, then
that's already half of success."</TE>
<TE>   Relations with Moscow are important because of Russia's "international
and regional role" and "the Russian market," Kovacs said.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the Hungarian economy, which once was tightly
integrated into Soviet-bloc trade, has turned heavily toward the West.
The trend of abandoning the Russian market has gone too far, Medgyessy
said.</TE>
<TE>   Medgyessy said he was sure that Russian President Vladimir V. Putin is
committed to reform. "I'm also convinced that in Russia, reform and
change have become irreversible in recent years," he said. "In terms of
economic relations, there are big opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   Rather than backing away from campaign promises of increased social
spending combined with tax cuts--a program many analysts said was
unrealistic--Medgyessy went out of his way Monday to stress that the
pledges would be fulfilled.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me highlight just a few important steps," he said. "In August, we
will pay a double amount of family subsidy before school starts, which
will be repeated every August. . . . From Oct. 1 and Sept. 1,
respectively, the pay of teachers and health-care workers will be raised.
Also, university scholarships will be increased by 30% from Sept. 1.
These are just examples."</TE>
<TE>   Medgyessy insisted that the government can afford the proposed social
programs. "Hungarian economic growth, if led professionally, can generate
the necessary resources," he said, predicting average growth of 4.5% over
the next four years. Analysts view that target as optimistic but not
unrealistic.</TE>
<TE>New Parliament Must Gather Within 30 Days</TE>
<TE>   Gabor Kuncze, leader of the Free Democrats, said at another news
conference Monday that coalition talks would require several weeks and
that "a government could be formed within six weeks from today."</TE>
<TE>   Hungarian President Ferenc Madl must convene the new parliament within
30 days after the election. He also must nominate a prime minister, seen
as virtually certain to be Medgyessy. The prime minister-designate needs
majority support in parliament to set up a government.</TE>
<TE>   Center-left leaders said there was no way that FiDeSz could gather
enough parliamentary support to stay in power.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter from the leaders of the center-left alliance to Madl,
Kovacs said, "We declared that neither the Hungarian Socialist Party nor
the Free Democrats would have coalition talks with FiDeSz or the
Hungarian Democratic Forum, so there is no chance for another party to
set up the government."</TE>

<HD>Security Ties Not Possible, Top Palestinian Says</HD>
<DH>Mideast: After the 'sea of blood and hatred' caused by Israel's
West Bank assault, Col. Jibril Rajoub says, cooperative policing is no
longer an option.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>

<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Security cooperation with Israel is impossible in the wake of its
three-week assault on the Palestinian Authority, a key Palestinian
official said Monday as he stood outside his heavily damaged
headquarters.</LD>
<LD>   The comments of Col. Jibril Rajoub underscored the daunting task U.S.
diplomats face in trying to rebuild trust between Israeli and Palestinian
security services as Israel winds down its military operation. Israeli
officials are discussing scenarios for expelling Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat and erecting buffer zones in the West Bank along
Israel's pre-1967 border.</LD>
<LD>   Many Israeli and U.S. officials have considered Rajoub a moderate, and
even a desirable successor to Arafat. He has kept his Preventive Security
Service fighters in the West Bank out of the 19-month-old conflict with
Israel and has periodically arrested militants planning attacks.</LD>
<TE>   But the gravelly voiced security chief said Monday that the Israelis
had "succeeded in creating a sea of blood and hatred. The Israelis have
also created a security vacuum."</TE>
<TE>   "There will be no further security cooperation with the Israelis," he
said after giving reporters a tour of his wrecked compound in the village
of Beitunia.</TE>
<TE>   Not far away, the power of Palestinian militias was on chilling
display in a downtown Ramallah square. Masked gunmen pulled three
Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel out of a taxi and
shot them as a large crowd watched.</TE>
<TE>   Footage shot by a foreign television crew showed one of the three
bleeding on the pavement as some in the crowd tried to prevent ambulances
from approaching.</TE>
<TE>   One of the three later died in a Ramallah hospital. Witnesses said the
gunmen shouted that they were with the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militia
linked to Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction, and had shot the men because
they were believed to have informed on Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti, who
was arrested by the Israeli army during the offensive.</TE>
<TE>   Five Palestinians, three in the Gaza Strip and two in the West Bank,
were reportedly shot dead by Israeli soldiers in other clashes Monday.</TE>
<TE>   An Israeli soldier serving with an elite unit was shot dead by
Palestinians in the northern West Bank. The Israeli army said two gunmen,
described as senior activists in the militant Islamic movement Hamas,
also were killed in that clash.</TE>
<TE>   Two other Palestinians, described by an army spokesman as "armed
terrorists," were killed near a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, where
they were shot by an Israeli undercover unit. Palestinians said an
unidentified man was shot dead by Israeli troops near a Jewish settlement
in Gaza. The army said it was checking the report.</TE>
<TE>   Later, news reports quoted residents of Hebron as saying Israeli
helicopters fired missiles at a car, killing the local commander of the
Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, Marwan Zalloum, and another man.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. envoy William Burns met for two hours with Arafat in the
Palestinian leader's battered Ramallah headquarters, where Israel has
confined him along with about 300 aides and peace activists in a few
rooms since March 29.</TE>
<TE>   The two discussed ways of resolving a dispute over five wanted men
sheltering in Arafat's compound and dozens of gunmen holed up in
Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity. Israel says four of the men with
Arafat participated in the October assassination of Tourism Minister
Rehavam Zeevi. The fifth, Fuad Shubaki, played a key role in purchasing a
shipment of arms from Iran that Israel intercepted at sea in January. The
Israelis want to put all five on trial.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Rashid, an Arafat aide, said the meeting with Burns had not
been positive.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation now is very dangerous, very sensitive," Palestinian
Minister of Information Yasser Abed-Rabbo said in a telephone interview.</TE>
<TE>   In Bethlehem, gunmen exchanged heavy fire Monday night with Israeli
troops ringing the 4th century Church of the Nativity.</TE>
<TE>   More than 200 people, including dozens of priests, nuns and civilians
as well as gunmen, are barricaded inside the church, which is built above
the grotto where Christians believe Jesus was born. Israel is demanding
that the gunmen surrender and face permanent exile abroad or military
tribunals.</TE>
<TE>   A 20-year-old man who was shot in the leg when he stepped outside the
church late last week said about 140 Palestinian civilians, including
about 50 youths, were trapped inside and too frightened to leave.</TE>
<TE>   Thaer Mohammed Manasra, an unemployed mechanic, said he had discussed
surrendering with several other Palestinians. He said gunmen discouraged
the group from leaving.</TE>
<TE>   "They told us: The Israelis will shoot you," Manasra said from his bed
in a Jerusalem hospital Monday. "We were scared of both sides. The ones
on the inside and the ones on the outside both have guns."</TE>
<TE>   Manasra is one of a handful of people who have managed to leave the
church. A 13-year-old boy slipped out earlier in the standoff, and five
men surrendered Sunday and were taken prisoner.</TE>
<TE>   Manasra denied that anyone was being held hostage or was a prisoner of
armed men in the church. "I don't know of anyone who is a prisoner," he
said. He said he had been on a trip to the market to buy vegetables when
he sought sanctuary from the advancing Israelis inside the church.</TE>
<TE>   Food supplies were scarce, Manasra said. After 15 days, he sneaked out
a door to try to grab some weeds growing in a church courtyard to eat.
Shots rang out, and he fell to the ground, his leg bone splintered by a
shot, Manasra said.</TE>
<TE>   A priest helped Manasra back inside and negotiated his evacuation to a
hospital. He is under guard and his hands are kept handcuffed as he lies
in his hospital bed, his leg in a cast from ankle to thigh.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has said that once the wanted men
at both sites surrender, Israel will pull its forces out of the remaining
one-eighth of Ramallah it controls and out of Bethlehem, as well as
surrounding villages. Israeli forces have already redeployed out of the
city centers of Nablus, Jenin, Kalkilya and Tulkarm, although they
continue to impose tight blockades on all West Bank towns and many
villages.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat has said he will not discuss a cease-fire until Israel
withdraws from all Palestinian-controlled areas it captured in the wake
of a series of Palestinian suicide attacks. But even if the forces
withdraw, it may be impossible to resurrect the security cooperation the
United States has said must underpin any Israeli-Palestinian agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "Technically and practically, it is impossible because we need to
reorganize and rebuild our security services, if we are allowed to do
that," Abed-Rabbo said. "And the other problem is that, until now, there
is no plan, no agreed-upon plan between us and the Israelis. We were
hoping that the Americans would put a plan in practice, but . . . we
don't know where we are going from here."</TE>
<TE>   Tanks and attack helicopters shelled Rajoub's CIA-built, three-story
headquarters on April 2 as Israeli forces swept through the West Bank.
The security compound came under fire after Rajoub refused to surrender
eight Islamic militants. The security chief was not there, but hundreds
of his men and their families huddled under fire for hours before
surrendering.</TE>
<TE>   The once-elegant structure, where Rajoub could pull his armored
Mercedes into the front lobby, now has large holes punched in the
blackened exterior walls. Windows were blown out, and every room suffered
extensive damage. In one office, archives and intelligence files were
burned. Damage was also widespread in most of the Palestinian Authority's
ministries in nearby Ramallah and Al Birah.</TE>

<DL>BAGHDAD
</DL>
<LD>President Saddam Hussein renewed his call Monday for Arab producers
to back an Iraqi oil embargo to protest Israeli incursions into
Palestinian territory.</LD>
<LD>   In a TV address, Hussein said producing countries should cut exports
by half and ban all oil sales to the U.S. and Israel.</LD>
<LD>   On April 8, Hussein announced a monthlong embargo on Iraqi oil sales
under the U.N. oil-for-food program. The sales, about 2 million barrels
daily, are allowed as an exception to sanctions in place since the 1991
Persian Gulf War.</LD>
<TE>   No other oil producer has followed Iraq's lead on an embargo. Saudi
Arabia, the world's biggest exporter, has ruled out the use of oil as a
weapon in the Middle East conflict. On Monday, Saudi Oil Minister Ali
Ibrahim Naimi said Riyadh would be prepared to fill any Iraqi shortage.</TE>

<LD>Calling Mexico's human rights vote against Cuba "the last straw,"
an angry President Fidel Castro on Monday played a recording of Mexican
President Vicente Fox encouraging him not to attend a U.N. conference
last month--contradicting Mexican officials' earlier account of Castro's
sudden departure from the gathering.</LD>
<LD>   "The aftermath of telling these truths could be that diplomatic
relations are severed," Castro said after playing a taped telephone
conversation that took place about 24 hours before the Cuban leader
planned to leave for the conference.</LD>
<LD>   On the tape, Fox asks Castro to leave immediately after his scheduled
speech, allegedly to avoid a politically awkward crossing with President
Bush.</LD>

<HD>French Far-Rightist Sees 'End of Cycle'</HD>
<DH>Politics: Though expected to lose in the face-off against Chirac
next month, Jean-Marie Le Pen comes out swinging.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS
</DL>
<LD>A veteran brawler savoring what is his biggest and perhaps last
success, presidential candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen declared Monday that
his electoral upset shows that he is the candidate of "little people"
challenging a discredited political system.</LD>
<LD>   On the day after his surprise second-place finish in the first-round
vote landed him a spot in next month's runoff against incumbent Jacques
Chirac, Le Pen met reporters to survey the political wreckage in his
wake.</LD>
<LD>   Le Pen, 73, and his far-right National Front bested Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin and 13 other candidates Sunday, causing the demoralized
Socialist leader to announce that he was resigning. As a dazed nation had
a conversation with itself about the implications of the election, Le Pen
said the performance of his National Front heralds fundamental change.</LD>
<TE>   "We are witnessing the end of a cycle in which a decadent, corrupt and
sclerotic political system is sinking," Le Pen told reporters who packed
his campaign headquarters. "France has experienced a national rupture
between the official nation, represented by a discredited pseudo-elite
embodied by Chirac, and the real nation, the French people who are
retaking their destiny in hand--a destiny to which they want to be led by
a free, honest and patriotic man."</TE>
<TE>   The center-right Chirac is expected to beat Le Pen by a commanding
margin May 5. But Le Pen, conceding nothing, had the time of his life at
the news conference. The often overt hostility of some journalists only
widened his smile and sharpened the sarcasm honed during four decades in
the campaign trenches. Le Pen's supporters wore T-shirts depicting him as
Zorro.</TE>
<TE>   When an Italian journalist asked about fears that Le Pen is a danger
to democracy, the candidate sneered: "Italy? Oh, you have a remarkable
example of civil peace there with the Red Brigades, the [scandals],
political corruption. You are really going to give me a lesson."</TE>
<TE>   When asked if he would continue trying to soften his image, Le Pen
beamed, struck a pose behind the microphone and chortled: "You find that
my image has been softened? Oh, I thank you very much; what a gift you
have given me. . . . Do you feel caressed?"</TE>
<TE>   It was vintage Le Pen: nimble, clownish, gleefully ferocious.
Meanwhile, thousands of protesters staged marches around the nation
condemning him. Critics see Le Pen as neo-fascist and racist because of
his anti-immigrant, anti-Europe nationalism and history of crude
comments.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Frugier, 27, joined hundreds of marchers in an anti-Le Pen
protest in the Place de la Republique late Monday. Frugier, who works in
an advertising agency, said she felt partly responsible for Le Pen's
showing because she had neglected to vote, contributing to the
near-record-low turnout.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm here to show my support for democracy," she said. "I don't think
that [Le Pen's victory] really reflects French reality, but more boredom.
The campaign was insipid and colorless."</TE>
<TE>   It's not colorless anymore. Political commentators tended to share the
protesters' distaste for the National Front candidate. But they largely
agreed with Le Pen's diagnosis: An abyss separates disgruntled voters
from an aloof political elite obsessed with theory and ideology.</TE>
<TE>   The blow to the professorial Jospin and his Socialists was especially
embarrassing because they have been shrilly critical of far-right leaders
elsewhere in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a crisis of representation in France," said Pierre
Giacometti of the Ipsos polling firm. "There is a gulf between the
habits, practices, lifestyle, thought processes and governing style of
the elites and reality as it is perceived by the public."</TE>
<TE>   Although Chirac topped the candidates with 19.6% of the vote, the
showing of his and other mainstream parties, including the Socialists,
was notably poor. In contrast, extremists of left and right racked up
unprecedented numbers: Old-fashioned Trotskyites and other marginal
leftists accounted for more than 15% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   With 17%, Le Pen added only about 2 percentage points to the National
Front's showing in the 1995 elections. He also benefited from absenteeism
and divisions on the left.</TE>
<TE>   Le Pen exploited genuine concerns and deep fears, experts said.
Calling himself an "economic rightist and a social leftist," Le Pen
stepped into terrain abandoned by out-of-touch leftists.</TE>
<TE>   "If you think about it, he has become the top candidate of the left,"
said a French official who analyzed the election for the government. "The
workers voted for him. The old Communist Party electorate went to him.
Why? Because he was the one who talked the most about their conditions of
life."</TE>
<TE>   Le Pen fared best among factory workers, small-business owners,
farmers and other working people in southern and eastern France, areas of
high crime and industrial decline. He painted the same ominous picture he
has for the last 20 years, saying predominantly Muslim immigrants from
North Africa are the root of unemployment, lawlessness and social and
cultural breakdown.</TE>
<TE>   Whether they agreed or not, many voters apparently found the
Socialist-led government unable and unwilling to confront the public
safety issue, Giacometti said. Chirac fared better than Jospin because he
made crime a priority, the pollster said.</TE>
<TE>   "The left has a cultural resistance to toughness on crime," Giacometti
said.</TE>
<TE>   Though Le Pen focuses on immigrants, the problems of crime and
alienation in France's ghettos are actually concentrated among French
citizens who are descendants of North African immigrants, the government
official said.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone in France knows that it is a problem of integration,
integrating the children of immigrants into the society, and that it
relates to crime," the French official said. "That's not racist. And
especially after Sept. 11, there's the question of terrorism. The only
person under arrest in the United States for Sept. 11 is a Frenchman of
North African origin. Le Pen is the only one who talks about those
issues."</TE>
<TE>   Jospin during the campaign proposed eliminating a law under which
immigrants convicted of crimes are deported once they serve prison time.</TE>
<TE>   Le Pen told journalists that French citizens of Arab and Jewish
descent are "my compatriots." But he also insisted that unchecked
immigration will ruin the country. He said many people have come around
to his way of thinking.</TE>
<TE>   "The voters are convinced that there is a direct connection between
crime and immigration," he said. "They are saying, 'Le Pen was right.' "</TE>

<HD>Abortion Clinic Protest Rules Face Review</HD>
<DH>Supreme Court: Justices will decide whether a law targeting
mobsters can apply to actions meant to halt providers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court, taking up an appeal from militant antiabortion
activists, said Monday it will decide whether medical clinics can use the
federal racketeering law against protesters who conspire to shut down
businesses that perform abortions.</LD>
<LD>   The case, to be heard in the fall, does not concern the right to
demonstrate peacefully. The justices turned away Operation Rescue's claim
that its clinic invasions were protected as free speech under the 1st
Amendment.</LD>
<LD>   However, the court agreed to hear the claim that abortion opponents
did not use the kind of force and threats that would constitute
racketeering activity.</LD>
<TE>   At issue again is the reach of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act of 1970, better known as RICO.</TE>
<TE>   Congress passed this broadly worded measure as a weapon against
organized crime. Mobsters who preyed on legitimate businesses could be
prosecuted in federal court or sued by private lawyers. Violators could
be ordered to stay away from these businesses and forced to pay for
losses they caused.</TE>
<TE>   But the law was used widely during the 1980s, and the Supreme Court
has said it extends well beyond mob cases.</TE>
<TE>   In their latest appeal, however, lawyers for Operation Rescue argue
that RICO does not apply to its activists because they were not seeking
to "obtain property" through the use of force and threats, citing a
clause from the federal "extortion" law.</TE>
<TE>   RICO is unusual in that it incorporates many other laws. For example,
an arsonist could be charged with violating arson law, and a "pattern" of
violations could trigger a RICO case as well.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the National Organization for Women brought a civil RICO
suit against Operation Rescue and alleged that the group had engaged in a
national campaign of violence and intimidation targeting health clinics
that performed abortions.</TE>
<TE>   Their lawsuit cited dozens of incidents: In Chico, Calif., clinic
staff members were shoved against a glass door and injured. In Pensacola,
Fla., several staff members were pushed down stairs, their offices were
trashed and their medical equipment damaged. In Los Angeles, a patient
who had undergone surgery was hit over the head with a sign and left
bleeding on the sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   The suit said the antiabortion leaders who were behind these incidents
violated the anti-extortion statute known as the Hobbs Act. This measure
makes it a federal offense to "obstruct commerce" or "obtain property"
through the "wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence or
fear." Repeated violations of the Hobbs Act make for a "pattern of
racketeering activity" that comes under RICO.</TE>
<TE>   But in the appeal, lawyers for Operation Rescue argued its members did
not violate the Hobbs Act because they did not obtain property.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to hear the appeal was unexpected, since the justices
rejected a similar claim arising from the same case eight years ago.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, a U.S. appeals court in Chicago threw out NOW's suit on
the grounds that Operation Rescue was acting for moral reasons, not an
"economic motive." Unlike mobsters, they were not seeking money from the
businesses they targeted, the court said.</TE>
<TE>   But the Supreme Court in 1994 unanimously reversed that ruling and
cleared the way for the suit to proceed. Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist said at the time that RICO covers a "pattern of racketeering
activity" such as robbery, murder and assaults, but it does not require
that money be the motivation.</TE>
<TE>   The case went to trial in Chicago, and NOW prevailed. A jury found
dozens of examples in which the protesters used force, human blockades
and violence against clinics. The plaintiffs were awarded $258,000 in
damages, and the trial judge issued a nationwide order that forbids the
protesters from trespassing at clinics, damaging property or interfering
with their operation for 10 years. Violators can be charged with a crime.</TE>
<TE>   "The injunction has been enormously effective in stopping clinic
violence," said Fay Clayton, the Chicago lawyer who represents NOW.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago also upheld the injunction and
the damages verdict last year. But lawyers for antiabortion activist
Joseph Scheidler and Operation Rescue appealed to the high court.</TE>
<TE>   The court granted both appeals Monday. Scheidler vs. NOW, 01-1118, and
Operation Rescue vs. NOW, 01-1119. The move suggests the justices, or at
least some of them, are interested in reconsidering the broad use of
RICO.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Sekulow, who represents Operation Rescue, said he was heartened.
"A federal statute designed for drug dealers and organized crime has been
misapplied to silence the pro-life message."</TE>

<HD>Bush, Gore Poles Apart on Earth Day</HD>
<DH>Environment: President visits Adirondacks to defend his policies
but ex-V.P. charges that he's serving special interests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WILMINGTON, N.Y.
</DL>
<LD>In a steady snowfall, President Bush celebrated Earth Day on Monday
by visiting the Adirondacks, where he described himself as an ardent
environmentalist for whom "every day is Earth Day."</LD>
<LD>   Reviewing the nation's "tremendous progress" on the environment since
the first Earth Day in 1970, he declared: "This Earth Day finds us on the
right path."</LD>
<LD>   Bush also flatly rejected criticism from environmentalists who say
that his "Clear Skies" initiative will do little to curtail power-plant
emissions of acid rain-producing sulfur dioxide, smog-causing nitrogen
oxide and mercury, which pollutes waterways and works its way up the food
chain.</LD>
<TE>   "Under Clear Skies legislation, America will do more to reduce power
plant emissions than ever before in our nation's history," he said in a
speech moved indoors at the last minute because of the unexpected
snowfall.</TE>
<TE>   The president's plan would set a nationwide cap on sulfur dioxide
emissions but allow older, dirtier plants to buy "credits" from newer,
cleaner plants.</TE>
<TE>   In his own Earth Day remarks, former Vice President Al Gore joined
environmentalists in arguing that the current Clean Air Act would strip
more pollutants from the air faster than the Bush plan, unless the
government is lax in applying existing law.</TE>
<TE>   "What kind of world are we building when parents of Little Leaguers
have to be more worried about them catching their breath than catching a
fly ball?" Gore said in a speech at Vanderbilt University in Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) said one of the biggest
shortcomings of Bush's air pollution proposal was its failure to regulate
emissions of carbon dioxide, the major greenhouse gas, from human
activities.</TE>
<TE>   "I still hope that the president wakes up and smells the carbon," said
Lieberman, who is sponsoring a bill that would regulate carbon dioxide
and the pollutants targeted in Bush's proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists marked Earth Day by criticizing the Bush
administration for siding with industries, and against the environment,
on everything from making Yucca Mountain a permanent repository for
nuclear wastes to reconsidering a ban on snowmobiles in Yellowstone
National Park.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush defended his environmental record, highlighting his support
for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which promotes a variety of
environmental conservation approaches. He noted that his fiscal year 2003
budget fully funds the conservation fund with more than $900 million for
the second consecutive year.</TE>
<TE>   And with gas prices soaring once more amid concerns that conflict in
the Middle East could lead to oil shortages, the president renewed his
call for independence from foreign sources of energy.</TE>
<TE>   At almost the same time, Gore was delivering his scathing critique of
Bush's environmental record.</TE>
<TE>   "America is only as healthy as the air our children breathe, the water
they drink and the Earth they will inherit," he said. "But instead of
embracing the bipartisan national consensus to improve our environment,
the Bush administration has chosen to serve the special interests instead
of the public interests and subsidize the obsolete, failed approaches of
the past, instead of the exciting new solutions of the future."</TE>
<TE>   In an opinion article in Sunday's New York Times, the president's 2000
rival for the White House argued that Bush's environmental policies "are
completely dominated by a group of current and former oil and chemical
company executives" determined to resist efforts to clean up the
environment.</TE>
<TE>   When asked here about Gore, the president replied: "Hadn't paid
attention to him." Told that Gore had lambasted Bush's environmental
record, the president added: "That's why I haven't paid attention to
him."</TE>
<TE>   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer discounted Gore's statements: "I think it
has more to do with internal Democratic presidential posturing than it
does with any serious assessment of the president's record on the
environment." Before his speech, Bush strolled along the scenic Ausable
River and stopped at several points to help volunteers rebuild a
meandering path, wielding a maul and then a hammer.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-million-acre Adirondack Park is considered a model of
public-private cooperation in land conservation.</TE>
<TE>   Even as he hailed the park as "good stewardship in action," Bush added
that "the federal government also has a big responsibility--and I
understand that."</TE>
<TE>   But Sen. James M. Jeffords (I-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Environment
and Public Works Committee, who has proposed an air pollution bill that
would cut emissions faster than Bush's plan, took issue with the choice
of location for the president's speech.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems a little strange that the president would go to upstate New
York to promote his plan," Jeffords said. "From what I understand, his
plan asks the Northeast to wait for decades before biological recovery
from acid rain impacts will begin. That's unfortunate, because I believe
we can do it sooner and still cost effectively."</TE>

<HD>Collusion Gets Sotheby's Ex-Chief a Prison Term</HD>
<DH>Art: One-year sentence for price-fixing comes despite concerns
about Taubman's health.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>A federal judge on Monday sentenced A. Alfred Taubman, the former
chairman of Sotheby's, to a year in prison for conspiring with his
counterpart at Christie's to fix commissions on items offered for
auction.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge George Daniels also ordered Taubman to pay a
$7.5-million fine.</LD>
<LD>   The collusion, which stifled competition between the two largest
auction houses, cost customers millions of dollars and focused attention
on shady business practices in the world of art and antiques.</LD>
<TE>   "Price-fixing is a crime whether it is committed in a local grocery
store or the hall of a great auction house," Daniels lectured the
principal owner of Sotheby's.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a deceitful, secretive criminal scheme whose whole object
and purpose was criminal profit. This was a crime motivated not by
desperation and need, but by arrogance and greed."</TE>
<TE>   Rejecting a probation report that had recommended against prison time,
Daniels said Taubman had failed to show contrition and had tried to blame
others while portraying himself as the victim of a vicious scheme.</TE>
<TE>   The judge said Taubman "clearly performed a supervisory and managerial
role" in the conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   "Regardless of what heights he has obtained in life, no one is above
the law," Daniels added.</TE>
<TE>   The sentence was less than the three years that prosecutors
wanted--and was mitigated, Daniels explained, by Taubman's poor health
and history of philanthropy.</TE>
<TE>   Testimonial letters from a broad cross-section of people--including
former President Ford, Barbara Walters, former Secretary of State Henry
A. Kissinger and members of Taubman's family--had urged leniency.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 5, a jury in federal court in Manhattan convicted Taubman of
plotting with Anthony J. Tennant--Christie's chairman from 1983 to
1996--to fix commissions on what sellers paid when they put artworks and
other items up for bidding.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors charged that the actions denied people who wanted to sell
goods at both Sotheby's and Christie's their ability to bargain over
fees.</TE>
<TE>   (Tennant, who lives in England, cannot be extradited on antitrust
charges.)</TE>
<TE>   The chief witness against Taubman, a Michigan shopping center
developer and art collector who bought the auction house in 1983, was
Diana D. Brooks, who resigned in 2000 as Sotheby's chief executive
officer and president.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks pleaded guilty to violating the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890
that prohibits unfair competition by maintaining a monopoly. She is
scheduled to be sentenced Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Taubman, a onetime investor in the Irvine Co. with Donald Bren, sat
quietly in court and declined to make a statement before he was
sentenced. But his lawyer, Robert B. Fiske Jr., presented the picture of
a 78-year-old who had multiple strokes, three heart procedures, takes 26
pills a day and, as his physicians attest, has a life expectancy of 3.8
years.</TE>
<TE>   He said Taubman's health could be seriously jeopardized in prison.</TE>
<TE>   "The government says if Mr. Taubman does not go to jail, he won't
suffer the consequences of his actions," Fiske told the court. "He is
totally devastated. It has left his life in shambles. . . . He stands
stripped of his reputation and his good name."</TE>
<TE>   But Justice Department prosecutor John J. Greene disputed that Taubman
was as infirm as the defense stated and said he would receive adequate
care in prison.</TE>
<TE>   "He hunts, he fishes, he plays golf," Greene said.</TE>
<TE>   "Imprisonment is necessary . . . for lack of imprisonment sends a
clear message that you can get away with it," the prosecutor told the
court. "He did violate the law."</TE>
<TE>   Daniels originally ordered Taubman to serve a one-year sentence. But
the judge added a day at the request of Fiske, so that Taubman could be
eligible to be released early for good behavior.</TE>
<TE>   The judge told Taubman to report to prison authorities on Aug. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers declined to say whether they would appeal.</TE>

<HD>Conferences End in Flare of Protest Activity</HD>
<DH>Meetings: Colombia activists are arrested while pro-Palestinian and
pro-Israel camps clash to cap weekend of Capitol demonstrations.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A long weekend of multithemed protests came to a close Monday with
the arrest of several dozen Colombia solidarity activists at the Capitol
and a boisterous but orderly pro-Palestinian demonstration near the
annual conference of a powerful pro-Israel group.</LD>
<LD>   The day began with hundreds of people participating in civil
disobedience by conducting a march without a permit against U.S. military
involvement in Colombia.</LD>
<LD>   After pledging to remain peaceful, the marchers zig-zagged across the
Mall and toward Capitol Hill, where small groups broke off to perform
"die-ins," which Eric LeCompte, one of the protest organizers, said
"commemorated the terrible massacres that have taken place in Colombia."</LD>
<TE>Protesters Try to Block Traffic</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Capitol police arrested 37 participants who stretched out on the
ground in an attempt to block traffic coming to the Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   Those arrested were placed in plastic handcuffs and taken without
incident to a waiting bus.</TE>
<TE>   After negotiating with police, the marchers were eventually allowed to
enter the park, where a wooden stand had been set up for speeches and
songs.</TE>
<TE>   In the afternoon, tensions ran hotter at a noisy rally on a major
Washington thoroughfare that filled a city block with demonstrators for
more than five hours.</TE>
<TE>   A block from a meeting of the American-Israel Public Affairs
Committee, or AIPAC, at the Washington Hilton, scores of Palestinian
supporters demanding a sovereign state shouted anti-Israel chants while a
phalanx of law enforcement officials stood guard behind metal barriers.</TE>
<TE>   At times, tempers came close to boiling over. Near a back entrance to
the hotel, which was barricaded on all sides by police blocking the
streets, AIPAC delegates and protesters screamed at each other.</TE>
<TE>   "Have you ever seen the brutality and violence of a suicide bomber?"
said Art Beroff, an AIPAC delegate from Howard Beach, N.Y., as police
held him back from the Palestinian flag-waving protesters on the other
side of the barrier.</TE>
<TE>Supporters of Israel and Palestinians Clash</TE>
<TE>   "When tanks go into [Palestinian] homes, when women and children are
hurt, how can you justify that?" countered Ture Bokar, a student at the
University of Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   As a handful of AIPAC delegates and protesters continued to clash,
dozens of Washington police in full riot gear appeared, running from
around the corner.</TE>
<TE>   Police then set up orange cones to form a buffer zone between the two
groups.</TE>
<TE>   Later, near the site of the main rally, a few men wearing yarmulkes
and carrying Israeli flags were pushed down the street by the surging
crowd.</TE>
<TE>   As police on motorcycles moved quickly to intervene, organizers from
the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee used bullhorns to urge
protesters to back off.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what they want you to do," said one young women, instructing
the crowd to remain peaceful.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the likelihood of changing U.S. policy toward Israel when
so many powerful U.S. politicians were attending or speaking at the AIPAC
conference, the pro-Palestinian organizers said they believed the
weekend's protests were a start.</TE>
<TE>   "It begins in the streets," said Mark Lance, a spokesman for the group
SUSTAIN, which helped organize the rally and a Saturday march that drew
tens of thousands.</TE>
<TE>   "There's going to be a change in this country as more people see the
brutality in Jenin and other Palestinian cities," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Washington police reported no arrests at the rally.</TE>
<TE>   "So far so good," said Chief Charles H. Ramsey, who stood at an
intersection near the hotel Monday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of anti-globalization protesters marched in Washington over
the weekend, drawn by World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings
that concluded Sunday. Ramsey said the protests went smoothly because
organizers and police worked together.</TE>
<TE>Demonstration Remains Peaceful</TE>
<TE>   "People have a right to demonstrate," Ramsey said. "But they do not
have a right to destroy property or endanger other people's lives. I
think after Sept. 11 most groups are making an effort not to be seen as
violent."</TE>
<TE>   In a scene that would have been difficult to imagine two years ago,
when his force arrested nearly 1,300 anti-World Bank protesters, Ramsey
was asked by several in attendance whether he would pose for pictures.</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely," he told one young man, who just minutes before had been
screaming over a line of police officers, trying to make his point heard
by AIPAC attendees.</TE>

<HD>Justices Weigh Sentencings in Capital Cases</HD>
<DH>Law: The Supreme Court has upheld the system of decision-making by
judges, but a ruling on the right to a jury trial reopens the issue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court justices struggled Monday over whether jurors,
rather than a judge, must decide on a death sentence for a murderer.</LD>
<LD>   The fate of nearly 800 death row inmates may turn on the answer to
that question.</LD>
<LD>   Most states, including California, require jurors to decide whether to
send a convicted killer to the death chamber. But nine states, including
Arizona, call on judges to decide on the proper sentence.</LD>
<TE>   In the past, the Supreme Court had squarely upheld the system of
sentencing by judges.</TE>
<TE>   But two years ago, in a New Jersey assault case, the court in a 5-4
decision described the right to a jury trial as fundamental in all cases.</TE>
<TE>   "Any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory
maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable
doubt," Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court in Apprendi vs. New
Jersey, in which the judge handed down an extra sentence after learning
that the circumstances of the case could be considered a hate crime. The
jury never heard that information.</TE>
<TE>   The logic of the Apprendi ruling requires that his client's death
sentence be overturned, a lawyer for an Arizona death row inmate said
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   A jury convicted Thomas Ring and several others of conspiring to rob a
Wells Fargo van in Phoenix, a crime that led to the death of the driver.
Under Arizona law, that conviction would normally lead to a life
sentence. In a separate hearing, a judge heard testimony from an
accomplice, who said that Ring had shot the driver and had bragged about
it. The judge then sentenced Ring to die.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Hurwitz, Ring's lawyer, said the jury should have heard this
evidence and decided upon Ring's guilt as the triggerman. The "basic
constitutional principle" is that "a jury of your peers" must decide
whether you are guilty of the ultimate crime, Hurwitz said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Arizona Atty. Gen. Janet Napolitano said the justices should
uphold Ring's death sentence. The jury found him guilty for his
involvement in a crime that led to a murder, and that is sufficient, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, Arizona's officials had relied on the court's earlier
rulings that allowed for sentencing by judges. It's too late now to upset
this system, she argued.</TE>
<TE>   For their part, the justices sounded sharply divided in the case of
Ring vs. Arizona, 01-488.</TE>
<TE>   This is the rare case where Justice Antonin Scalia may be the swing
vote.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, he joined the majority decision to overturn the extra
sentence handed out in the New Jersey hate crimes case. But on Monday, he
said he did not believe that ruling required him to vote to overturn
Arizona's death sentence.</TE>
<TE>   "We've already said it is enough for this finding [of the triggerman's
role] to be made by the judge," Scalia said. It is too late to reverse
course now, he said, echoing the state's argument.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the court took up the case of a Tennessee death row inmate
to decide whether a belated discovery of new evidence can be used to
reopen an old case.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the inmate, Abu-Ali Abdur'Rahman, say he would not have
been sentenced to death had the jury been told about the abuse he had
suffered as a child. But state prosecutors said it was too late now to
consider such evidence.</TE>

<HD>Evidence Suggests Skulduggery Among the Neanderthals</HD>
<DH>Anthropology: Scientists say an ancient skull was violently hacked
by a machete-like object. With assistance, the victim survived.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Neanderthals dissatisfied with their colleagues' behavior
apparently dealt with their anger in much the same way as modern humans
do today. They were quite willing to bash enemies over the head, and
quite adept at seeking out the best available weapon for the job.</LD>
<LD>   In a new analysis released Monday, anthropologists suggested that the
hole in the head of a young adult Neanderthal who died about 36,000 years
ago, near what is now the village of St. Cesaire in southwestern France,
was probably made by someone who sliced open the skull with a
machete-like knife or sword. Equally important, the victim got enough
help from family and friends to survive the experience.</LD>
<LD>   "Aggression just forms part of human behavior," said Christoph
Zollikofer of the University of Zurich, leader of the team of researchers
from France and Switzerland who examined the skull. Humans "need
reconciliation and affection as well, and the experience here suggests a
broad spectrum of behaviors."</LD>
<TE>   The St. Cesaire site, discovered in 1979, is celebrated because it
dates from the "transitional" period when Neanderthals, masters of the
European Ice Age, were being displaced by anatomically modern immigrants
from Africa, either by assimilation or extermination.</TE>
<TE>Scar Indicates Skull Was Sharply Slashed</TE>
<TE>   Zollikofer said the team was doing a computer-assisted reconstruction
of the St. Cesaire skull when it noticed a 2.7-inch-long scar in the bone
on the top right-hand side.</TE>
<TE>   The position of the cut all but ruled out an accidental fall, while
the shape of the wound and the fact that the rest of the skull was
neither fractured nor misshapen indicated a slashing or hacking motion
with a sharp, blade-like tool or weapon, rather than a club or ax.</TE>
<TE>   "There was almost certainly a flint cutting edge, and it was hafted
onto a wooden handle," said Neanderthal specialist Erik Trinkaus of
Washington University in St. Louis, commenting on Monday's announcement.
"What you had was a large machete-like implement, except that we don't
have the wood."</TE>
<TE>   Zollikofer said scarring of the bone showed that the victim survived.
Had the wound been fatal, the bone would not have regenerated, and
scientists could not have distinguished the head trauma from the effects
of weather or site damage.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a serious wound, in that it would have bled pretty seriously,"
Trinkaus said. "Even though there was no pushing of bone down into the
brain case, it would have [really] hurt. . . ."</TE>
<TE>   And survival without infection would have meant that other members of
the community would have had to tend the victim. Earlier research by
Trinkaus and others has shown that Neanderthals cared for the sick and
infirm, and the latest findings simply close the loop, Zollikofer said.</TE>
<TE>   Violence "is natural behavior among social primates," Zollikofer said.
"The biggest difference between apes and hominids [humans and human
ancestors] is the involvement of tools."</TE>
<TE>   And this, Trinkaus added, makes violent encounters much more
dangerous. "As weaponry increased in sophistication, the risk of serious
injury went up," he said. "If all you have is your fist, the injury isn't
that bad."</TE>
<TE>   Even though early modern humans had appeared in Europe by the time of
the Neanderthals' St. Cesaire habitation, there is no evidence they were
in the area at that moment, and Zollikofer said it was unlikely the young
Neanderthal had been hurt in some form of inter-species war.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, domestic violence, then as now, was the most likely cause:
"You encounter your group members each day," Zollikofer said. "And we
think that with the very low population density then, you were highly
unlikely to meet somebody else."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he added, "almost anything is possible." A weapon of the type
that inflicted the wound to the young Neanderthal was not found at St.
Cesaire, but Trinkaus said Neanderthals had the technology to accomplish
the job, as did modern humans.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, added Trinkaus, modern humans had throwing spears and other
weapons that enabled them to hunt large animals from a distance, while
Neanderthals' heavy, pike-like spears required closer, more dangerous
work.</TE>
<TE>   That's probably why the skeleton of almost any Neanderthal adult shows
evidence of three or four broken bones, mostly in the upper body.
Trinkaus compared these characteristic Neanderthal injuries to those of
today's rodeo cowboys.</TE>
<TE>   "But we don't see any breaks of major long bones in the legs," he
said. "The interpretation is that either this is because the injuries all
involve close encounters with large animals, or, if someone broke a leg,
they simply got left behind."</TE>

<DH>Charity: Teens at a Manhattan private school send free formal wear

<DL>CLAY, W.Va.
</DL>
<LD>It was not her favorite color, and it hung from a rack made from
two-by-fours and pipes, but it was the perfect prom dress for Jennifer
Mullins: It had straps, it came with a wrap, and it was free.</LD>
<LD>   Mullins, 18, made her choice Monday at a makeshift boutique in the
Clay County High School gym, which was stocked with about 450 gowns
donated by students and parents at an exclusive private girls school in
New York City.</LD>
<LD>   In an event dubbed Operation Prom Dress, students at the Hewitt School
in Manhattan, where the yearly tuition is nearly $20,000, sent the new
and used dresses--along with shoes, gloves, jewelry and other
accessories--to girls in this poverty-stricken Appalachian county where
the median annual household income was about $21,000 in 1997.</LD>
<TE>   All of Clay County High's 325 or so girls were allowed to select a
dress and accessories. So were some teachers who will be chaperons at the
May 11 prom.</TE>
<TE>   "I found a great dress. It's not pink, but it's really pretty. It's
black and sort of blue and shiny," Mullins said.</TE>
<TE>   Katie Walker, 18, did find a pink one--strapless with sequined trim
along the bodice. "I love it. I feel so elegant," she said. "I saw this
when we were putting out the dresses. So when it was my turn, I went
straight to it, tried it on and it fit."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the dresses arrived by truck last week. Six Hewitt students,
six parents and two faculty members flew by private jet Monday to
Charleston, then traveled 60 miles by van to bring the last 50 dresses to
Clay.</TE>
<TE>   "This is so wonderful. It makes me excited for my own prom. The girls
are so nice and welcoming," said Claire Henry, 17, of New York City. "The
drive from Charleston was very beautiful. Everything is so green. It's
very different from New York City."</TE>
<TE>   Henry said she sees Operation Prom Dress as a way to say thank you for
some of the help New York received after the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Clay, a no-stoplight town of about 600, is situated in a
coal-and-timber area where unemployment is 12%, one-third of the children
live in poverty and about a quarter of the homes are trailers.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Clay County High is a National School of Excellence with one of
the highest attendance records in West Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   "The girls are so excited, and the boys have pitched in and built
clothing racks," said Principal Cindy Willis. "All the girls are included
whether they are needy or not. They appreciate this offer of friendship."</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Hardman, 18, who helped build the dress racks, said he did not
feel left out.</TE>
<TE>   "The girls' dresses are much more expensive than what boys spend. We
may only have to spend $100 on a tux and flowers, but the dresses can be
$300, $400, $500," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Operation Prom Dress grew out of conversations between Willis and Dena
McKelvey, whose daughter is a junior at Hewitt. McKelvey and her husband,
Andy, had helped Clay County residents in the past through the McKelvey
Foundation by providing scholarships and clothing.</TE>
<TE>   "Our girls in New York go to so many bat mitzvahs and parties that
they have a lot of dresses," McKelvey said. "You wear a dress once, you
can't wear it again. That's just not cool."</TE>
<TE>   Linda Gibbs, head of the Hewitt School, said she hopes to involve
other New York private schools in Operation Prom Dress and perhaps make
it a regular event.</TE>
<TE>   "All of our students are young women of privilege," Gibbs said. "They
may not all be wealthy, but they all have great opportunities. That's why
we believe strongly that those who have much have an obligation to give
back."</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>The New York archdiocese distanced itself Monday from a
high-ranking official's sermon that blamed the Catholic Church's
child-molestation scandal on gay priests and widespread American
immorality.</LD>
<LD>   Msgr. Eugene Clark, who was filling in Sunday for Cardinal Edward Egan
at the pulpit of St. Patrick's Cathedral, gave the sermon without
consulting Egan, according to both Clark and the archdiocese.</LD>
<LD>   "He was speaking for himself," archdiocese spokesman Joe Zwilling
said.</LD>
<TE>   Clark, the rector of St. Patrick's, called the United States "probably
the most immoral country in the Western Hemisphere," labeled
homosexuality "a disorder" and called admitting gay students into
seminaries a "grave mistake," the Daily News reported Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Clark said Monday that he did not discuss his sermon with Egan and
that his homily had been "misconstrued and misinterpreted."</TE>

<HD>Nev. Priest Allegedly Abused 5 Boys</HD>
<DH>Clergy: Charges against Father Mark Roberts include taking
pornographic photos of two of the youths.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS
</DL>
<LD>A Catholic priest in nearby Henderson was charged by county
prosecutors Monday with abusing five teenage boys, including taking
pornographic pictures of two of them.</LD>
<LD>   Father Mark Roberts, 51, faces two felony counts of using a minor in
the production of pornography. He was also charged with two counts of
lewdness for fondling two of the boys, and five counts of abuse and
neglect of children. Each of those seven charges is a misdemeanor.</LD>
<LD>   The Diocese of Las Vegas suspended the priest Jan. 30, after the
allegations surfaced, said church spokeswoman Rachel Wilkie. In 1995, she
said, Roberts was accused of inappropriate conduct by an adult that
resulted in undisclosed treatment, but he had not been criminally
investigated.</LD>
<TE>   Roberts had been assigned to St. Peter the Apostle Church. He is at an
unidentified location for the treatment of an undisclosed medical
condition, Wilkie said.</TE>
<TE>   Clark County Dist. Atty. Stewart Bell said Roberts' attorney has
promised the priest will appear for arraignment next Tuesday. The
attorney, George Foley Sr., could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   In a written statement, Bishop Joseph Pepe said, "I want to reassure
our parishioners that we will continue to reach out to those affected by
these allegations to ensure that their needs are being met with pastoral
sensitivity and concern."</TE>
<TE>   The charges are the most recent involving dozens of priests in the
United States, from Los Angeles to Boston and West Palm Beach, Fla.,
accused of abusing children and teenagers, and costing the church
millions of dollars in settlements.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts is the first priest criminally accused of misconduct in Nevada
since the current nationwide church crisis surfaced in January.</TE>
<TE>   The allegations against Roberts stem from incidents over a three-year
period ending last year, Bell said. The alleged victims, between ages 16
and 18 at the time, sought the priest for counseling, Bell said.</TE>
<TE>   "The suspect was in a counselor relationship with the victims," Bell
said. "One thing led to another, to the point where there was some nudity
and some fondling, and allegedly lewd pictures taken with a Polaroid
camera."</TE>
<TE>   A felony conviction carries a fine of up to $100,000 and could include
either probation, 15 years' imprisonment or a life sentence.</TE>
<TE>   The lesser charges are punishable by up to a year in county jail and a
maximum $2,000 fine.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a difficult time for the church, a time for reflection and
growth," Pepe said. "However, I believe that out of adversity comes
strength. We are here and are listening to the needs of our parishioners,
and we will get through this together."</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, more accustomed to
briefing President Bush on world crises, gave him instead a flawless
performance of Brahms at Monday's presentation of the National Medals of
Arts and National Humanities Medals.</LD>
<LD>   In a long black ball gown, the accomplished pianist accompanied
cellist Yo-Yo Ma in the slow movement of Brahms' violin sonata in D
minor. An approving Ma insisted afterward that Rice, who began playing
the piano at age 3 1/2, take several bows to a standing ovation and then
he led her across the Constitution Hall stage for a congratulatory kiss
from the president.</LD>
<LD>   Spokeswoman Anna Perez said that Rice had earlier in the day squeezed
in rehearsal time with Ma between national security meetings.</LD>
<TE>   Rice's unusual duet with Ma was, in First Lady Laura Bush's words, a
"prayer for peace."</TE>
<TE>   They performed at the close of a ceremony in which the Bushes awarded
national medals to Ma and 15 other artists and writers: Alvin Ailey Dance
Foundation; Latino writer Rudolfo Anaya; country music legend Johnny
Cash; actor and director Kirk Douglas; pioneer "color field" painter
Helen Frankenthaler; modern dance educator Judith Jamison; comedy
director Mike Nichols; Jose Cisneros, illustrator of America's Southwest;
psychiatrist Robert Coles; literacy advocate Sharon Darling; historian
and writer William Manchester; the National Trust for Historic
Preservation; Richard Peck, novelist for young readers; musicologist
Eileen Jackson Southern, and novelist Tom Wolfe.</TE>
