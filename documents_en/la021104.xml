<LD>To get ahead, sometimes you have to go backward.</LD>
<LD>   Which is why rotten, suffocating, grueling and ever-worsening
Manhattan traffic has been very good for Evgueni Alexandrovitfch
Smykov, better known as Alex.</LD>
<LD>   He is New York's latest traffic messiah, a little man who the
billionaire mayor of this city couldn't possibly comprehend. He
drives a bicycle-powered rickshaw. In other major American cities, an
oversized tricycle pulling a bench is considered a tourist whimsy, a
fun way to tour the waterfront of San Francisco or the streets of old
San Diego. In New York, however, it is a novelty turned survival
tool.</LD>
<TE>   On this smallish island of Manhattan -- less than two miles wide
and 14 miles long -- congestion is horrific and has been getting
worse for decades. Up to a million cars converge on the island every
day. Mayor Michael Bloomberg wants to finally end the 20-block
SigAlert that is Midtown by turning it into a Pac Man maze of
no-turn, one-way streets. For this he is willing to take on an
especially nasty crowd: surly New York commuters and burly
deliverymen who haul concrete for a living. The mayor is the kind of
politician who now and then rides a subway but spent most of his
adult life looking at the back of a chauffeur's head. During his
campaign, he promised New Yorkers he'd make them less auto dependent.
His first step was to extend some traffic-reducing, post-Sept. 11
restrictions on bridges and tunnels.</TE>
<TE>   Then Bloomberg learned that the average speed of a car in
Manhattan was 4.8 mph, only 1.4 more than the pace of a lowly human
on foot. This drove hizzoner berserk -- and lead to a slew of new
rules. No lefts, no rights on several busy crosstown streets. New
bans against curbside "standing" (which is New York-speak for sitting
in your car doing nothing in a no-parking zone). Perhaps most daring,
the mayor is talking about adding tolls on all the East River bridges
to raise cash and keep cars out of the city. Previous administrations
haven't had the guts to do it.</TE>
<TE>   Which is why we find Alex, on a cold fall afternoon, near the
Plaza Hotel threading his rickshaw through bumper-to-bumper traffic.
"This is what I can do that cars can't," he says triumphantly. He
then offers his business card: "Alex the Pedicab Driver. Take a
Ride!"</TE>
<TE>   Alex says he was studying to be a translator in his native
Libetsk, a steel town 300 miles southeast of Moscow, when he decided
to spend a year in New York. He settled in breezy Sheepshead Bay in
Brooklyn and found a job pedaling, negotiating in his halting English
the price of a ride with each customer and earning as much as $300 a
day.</TE>
<TE>   After stoking up each morning on a breakfast of Chinese take-out
-- meat dumplings, pork soup, fried rice -- Alex, who weighs 120
pounds, takes a one-hour subway ride to pick up his pedicab in
Midtown. The mayor wishes everyone in Brooklyn would go to work that
way. For unlike L.A., which has the worst traffic of any American
city but inadequate public transportation, New York has plenty of
buses and subways and taxis.</TE>
<TE>   The busiest times for Alex are rush hour (what a misnomer!),
before the theaters open in Times Square, after they let out and
always, always, when it rains. More than half of Alex's customers are
crazed businessmen who will throw a 20 at him and demand he go 20
blocks "in a big hurry." "During rush hour I can be faster than a
taxi," he boasts as he breathlessly pedals up Sixth Avenue with two
women who've just had a big lunch. And yes, Manhattan has hills, and
the most horribly rutted streets and car doors that seem to fly open
out of nowhere and ruthless city bus drivers who would mow down their
mothers to stay on schedule. All of this can frighten the customers
or slow Alex's progress, he says. But to the peril of none, his boss
insists.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been no passengers or drivers injured in the entire
seven years that pedicabs have been on New York streets," says Arty
Nichols, who started Manhattan Pedicabs in May. Before that he
exclusively owned horse-drawn carriages. But you don't have to feed a
bike or clean up after it. Nichols added 10 pedicabs to the streets,
bringing the total here to 60. He rents them by the day for $40 to a
variety of young men, mostly Eastern Europeans, who like the
independence of the job and the thrill of racing (or not) through the
city. Not one to worry about political correctness, Nichols had tried
to persuade one of his Asian carriage drivers to operate a pedicab.
"I wanted to do up one of the bikes like real a rickshaw, with black
Chinese writing on it," Nichols says.</TE>
<TE>   But the driver objected: the work was too hard. Nichols says he
expects the pedicab population to swell. "It's a reality, a way
around the gridlock," he adds.</TE>
<TE>   Or a defense against a dignitary's motorcade jamming traffic for
40 blocks in all directions. Or against the marathon that touches all
five boroughs and paralyzes traffic on a sunny Sunday. Or against a
spontaneous United States president like Bill Clinton who gets a
hankering for a knish at the Carnegie Deli just before curtain time
on Broadway. Skinny, sweet-faced Alex on a rickety seven-speed may
not be the solution to gridlock, sort of like discovering the little
umbrella in last night's pina colada is not your best defense against
a morning downpour.</TE>
<TE>   But in a time when the mayor may raise the subway fare, when
freeway advisory boards never seem to carry good news and when rapid
transit is hardly that, maybe a step backward is the right way to go.</TE>

<HD>Strokes delight, but is this it?</HD>
<DH>New York band shows grit in its sold-out show at the
Greek, but a lack of depth may hinder the quintet in the long run.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Hilburn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was great at the Strokes' sold-out concert Friday at the Greek
Theatre to see taste-maker KROQ-FM (106.7) using its influence to
help turn young rock fans on to something more substantial than Blink
182 -- and it was even better to see some 6,500 fans respond so
enthusiastically.</LD>
<LD>   That's not to say that the Strokes, who also sold out the Greek on
Saturday, are necessarily great themselves.</LD>
<LD>   The New York quintet has already earned a place in rock history
for helping open the door to a generation of exciting and passionate
new bands, including the White Stripes and the Hives.</LD>
<TE>   One of the more intriguing questions in pop these days, however,
is whether the Strokes will eventually be a chapter or a footnote in
this movement.</TE>
<TE>   Through a combination of wardrobe (a new-wave, thrift-store chic
that photo editors love) and a sensual, minimalist sound that critics
have cherished since it was popularized in the '60s by the Velvet
Underground, the Strokes came along at the precise moment in early
2001 when the always-hyperventilating British rock press needed
another "next big thing."</TE>
<TE>   When adventurous rock fans there embraced the Strokes, the search
was on for other bands that also had distinctive stances and drew
upon such '60s rock values as introspective themes and melodic tunes.
That led to equally lavish attention on such other newcomers as the
Stripes, the Hives and the Vines.</TE>
<TE>   The buzz in England was so strong that it eventually caught the
ear of U.S. record company and rock radio station executives,
including KROQ-FM, which helped promote the weekend shows. Many of
these execs -- surely bored stiff by the drab, derivative nature of
the rock-rap and angry rock bands of recent years -- began
championing the fresh new acts. By September, even increasingly
conservative Rolling Stone finally put one of the new bands (the
Vines) on its cover and declared that rock 'n' roll was back.</TE>
<TE>   At the Greek on Friday, you'd like to have thought the shrieks of
delight from the young female fans when the Strokes took the stage
was for the renewed rock spirit -- the Greek is the biggest local
headline date for any of these new groups. But the cries of affection
were more likely for lead singer Julian Casablancas. His cuddly good
looks and shy, understated demeanor are ideal for the Strokes' music,
which is all about coming of age.</TE>
<TE>   In the group's "Is This It?" album, which has passed the 500,000
mark in this country, Casablancas is always trying to make sense of
things around him, especially relationships. Like young people of
every generation, he's not sure if his biggest problem is that no one
seems to understand him or that he doesn't understand his own
impulses and needs.</TE>
<TE>   He puzzles through these and other questions, on stage and record,
in a rather soft monotone that is frequently buried beneath the
slashing guitar-driven musical textures, making it all the more
vulnerable and enticing. The music itself is highly melodic and
appealing at times. "Last Nite," a radio hit for the band, has enough
of the surface shadows of the Velvets that it could be passed off as
a lost Velvets track from 1967.</TE>
<TE>   The good sign Friday was that the Strokes played the song -- and
such other inviting ones as the grittier, defiant "Barely Legal" and
the especially tuneful "Someday" -- with a toughness and bite that
suggested the group hasn't been lulled into complacency by the media
attention. They know they still have everything to prove.</TE>
<TE>   But can they?</TE>
<TE>   The Strokes played a few new songs that presumably will be on the
group's second album, yet they were inconclusive. In most cases, the
numbers seemed simply like extensions of what the band already gave
us in "Is This It?" They don't correct the band's main weakness:
depth.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that the Strokes' lyrics seem to be a soundtrack for
young people is encouraging. This is what rock 'n' roll should be --
not merely the dead-end frivolity and calculation of so many rock
acts from the late '90s. But great young bands must go beyond surface
concerns to speak about adolescent issues in ways that remain
absorbing or revealing years later.</TE>
<TE>   There is so little of that revelation in a song such as "Last
Nite," however, that it is already beginning to sound like an oldie.
It could easily be mistaken for something from, say, the Cars' 1979
album "Candy-O." To be a leader of the new rock, the Strokes need to
dig much deeper and tell us much more.</TE>

<LD>A message to parents</LD>
<LD>   and teachers:</LD>
<LD>   Most of us have had something scary happen to us at least once in
our lives. Or we may have heard about things happening elsewhere and
worry that they could happen to us.</LD>
<TE>   Children are no different. It is important for them to be able to
talk about what scares them, especially in today's world.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some simple suggestions for parents and teachers to keep
in mind when trying to help children and students overcome their
fears.</TE>
<TE>   Become informed so you can help children understand more about
what frightens them.</TE>
<TE>   Choose a good time and place to talk when there will be no
interruptions.</TE>
<TE>   Ask children how they feel and listen to them.</TE>
<TE>   If children have bad dreams, have them draw pictures or write
about them. Ask them to imagine different, better endings to their
dreams.</TE>
<TE>   If children are afraid of something that has happened in a far-off
place, show them where it is. Reassure them it is not likely to
happen to them.</TE>
<TE>   For things closer to home, talk about the many adults at home, at
school and in the community who work hard to keep children safe. Tell
them what things they can do to stay safe.</TE>
<TE>   For more helpful information, check these online resources: the
American Psychological Assn., www.apa.org; the National Assn. of
School Psychologists, www. nasponline.org and the American Red Cross
community disaster education materials,
www.redcross.org/pubs/dspubs/cde.html.</TE>
<TE>   "What scares you?" is the next topic for Question Corner. We are
asking children to tell us what they are afraid of and why. What
kinds of things make them feel better? Pictures, with a sentence or
two of explanation, are also welcome. We will publish some of the
responses in this column over the next several weeks. See "How to
Write to Us" for more information.</TE>

<HD>If only Carrie could use her power against remakes</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The original "Carrie" must be spinning in its film vault. Instead of
being allowed to rest in peace, another movie classic has been
pointlessly redone.</LD>
<LD>   NBC is billing this three-hour version of "Carrie," which airs at
8 tonight and is rated TV-14, as a more faithful adaptation of
Stephen King's horror novel because it includes scenes director Brian
De Palma and screenwriter Lawrence Cohen left out of the 1976
original -- which only confirms that truer doesn't necessarily mean
better.</LD>
<LD>   De Palma's film built tantalizing suspense as Carrie gradually got
in touch with her supernatural side, but this version by director
David Carson and writer Bryan Fuller spoils the mood by unleashing
too much too soon, including an early barrage of silly digital
effects.</LD>
<TE>   This update is especially disappointing because the basic story,
with its themes of religious terror and campus revenge, should be
more relevant than ever in today's world.</TE>
<TE>   Angela Bettis ("Girl, Interrupted") stars in the title role as an
outcast tormented by her high school classmates and her fanatical

<HD>Will role in 'Femme Fatale' be her runway to success?</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In Hollywood's never-ending quest for the next big female star,
producers often look to the fashion world for a model to pluck from
the runway to transform into the next Julia or Halle. Lucille Ball,
Suzy Parker, Isabella Rossellini, Cybill Shepherd, Halle Berry and
Andie MacDowell are just a few former models who found a new career
in the movies. But for every success story, there is failure. Does
anyone remember Elle Macpherson's painful screen debut in "Sirens"?
Or Heidi Klum's guest-starring stint on "Spin City" a few years back
in which she displayed a range of emotions from A to B?</LD>
<LD>   The latest model to attempt to cross over is Rebecca
Romijn-Stamos, who made her feature film debut three years ago in a
cameo in "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me." Romijn-Stamos also
has been the host of MTV's "House of Style" and a guest star on
"Friends" and "Just Shoot Me."</LD>
<LD>   She also made a striking impression as the villainous blue-painted
Mystique in "The X-Men" and is repeating that role in the sequel
"X2." But she was stiff as a skateboard in the disastrous remake of
"Rollerball."</LD>
<TE>   The big question is: Can she carry a film?</TE>
<TE>   Romijn-Stamos has her biggest role to date in Brian De Palma's
erotic new thriller, "Femme Fatale," which opens Wednesday. She plays
Laure Ash, a manipulative, gorgeous jewel thief who leaves her life
of crime and transforms herself into a respectable married woman with
a high-profile political life. But her new identity is threatened
when she attracts the attention of a former paparazzo (Antonio
Banderas).</TE>

<HD>As 'Push' gets shoved, TV loses another fictional town</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andy Edelstein</AU>
<BD>Newsday</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The recent demise of ABC's freshman series "Push, Nevada" warranted
the shedding of a tear.</LD>
<LD>   Not because it was an innovative and quirky program. But because
it was one of the few series to uphold a venerable prime-time
tradition: being set in a fictional locale.</LD>
<LD>   Think of Mayberry ("Andy Griffith") and Mayfield ("Leave It to
Beaver"). Hilldale ("Donna Reed") and Hooterville ("Green Acres,"
"Petticoat Junction"). Or even Lanford ("Roseanne") and Cicely
("Northern Exposure").</LD>
<TE>   They were burgs that existed in your imagination, not on the road
map. But in prime-time 2002, they're nearly extinct (exceptions:
"Ed's" Stuckeyville, "Everwood" and "Buffy the Vampire Slayer's"
Sunnydale). Nowadays, most shows are set in real locales, even if
they're shot on back lots in Southern California or Vancouver.</TE>
<TE>   The dearth of fictional locales is "unfortunate," says Larry
Jones, executive vice president and general manager of TV Land and
Nick at Nite, cable homes of vintage tube fare. "It does feel like
it's a loss of innocence. We are not being encouraged to fantasize.
Creators are no longer willing to grant us the leap of faith that
Mayberry exists."</TE>
<TE>   As for why reality rules, Jones postulates: "Today we need
information more quickly. Emphasizing real locations is a kind of
shorthand for creators and writers to set a tone at the outset. If a
show is set in Boston, for instance, you can make certain assumptions
about the characters or sensibilities."</TE>

Oh, say can you sing</KH>
<HD>Oh, say can you sing?</HD>
<DH>The national anthem has defeated the best, but that doesn't
deter wannabes at a Clippers tryout.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Baker</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"If you do nothing else in your life, don't ever sing the national
anthem at a ballgame."</LD>
<LD>   -- Nat King Cole, after a flawed attempt</LD>
<LD>   "As we sta-and here waiting / For the game to be-gin....</LD>
<TE>   -- Albert Brooks' opening lyric in</TE>
<TE>   "Rewriting the National Anthem"</TE>
<TE>   Sonia and Sabrina Millen have prepared all their lives for a
chance to slay this beast. The 16-year-old twins have been
harmonizing since they were 3 months old. They've taken on the beast
at lesser venues -- minor league baseball and basketball games in
their native New Jersey. But this is the big time. This is why their
parents moved the family to L.A. in June, to get the sisters a shot
in the spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   They're about to try to slay the beast of public performance
challenges in front of 10,672 L.A. Clipper fans in Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   First, though, let's go back 2 1/2 weeks, to a public audition at
which the Clippers searched for that rarest of human beings: someone
who can sing "The Star-Spangled Banner" without messing up.</TE>
<TE>   If you've ever wondered just why it is so hard to master Francis
Scott Key's poem of battle, written during the War of 1812, and its
melody, taken from a traditional English drinking song, this audition
is the place to be. One by one, more than 80 contestants compile a
textbook of all the elements that have to jell -- and almost never do
-- if a singer is to conquer the national anthem. They struggle to
achieve the right pitch (start low because you have to climb a 1
1/2-octave mountain), diction (you've got "night," "light,"
"twilight," "bright" and "fight"), timing, pace, harmony and memory.
(Robert Goulet is still mocked for singing "by the dawn's early
night" at a title fight in '65.)</TE>
<TE>   The Millen twins, and most of the others who attended the open-air
audition on a recent Saturday at 10 a.m., fantasized that they would
be discovered at a Clipper game by a season ticket-holding record
industry exec.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an appeal to the gatekeepers," says Angela Moore Hodge, a
physician's assistant and occasional performer under the name Angela
Denise, who is the first contestant to arrive -- at 5 a.m. She is
confident about her chances. "All you gotta do is feel it. And I'm an
American." Jessica Leyva, 15, is there because her mother went out
and got the sheet music and CD the night before. A.J. Harwin, a
recent law school graduate, is there because he did some singing in
college. Patrick Minner is there because he'd sung the anthem at a
Portland Trailblazers game.</TE>
<TE>   Most national anthems are booked through professional connections,
but Laura Martin, the Clippers' promotion and events coordinator,
figures that, in a town dripping with talent and wannabes, she can
pluck a few talented wannabes out of a crowd and garner a little
goodwill for L.A.'s longest-suffering sports franchise at the same
time.</TE>
<TE>   Martin, an anthem traditionalist (she minored in music at East
Texas Baptist University), instructs contestants to finish their a
cappella versions within 90 seconds, a workmanlike pace. Many fail
this test because they are inclined to soulfully stretch a handful of
key syllables. Their stubbornness reflects the lasting effect of
Whitney Houston's dramatic gospel-influenced performance at Super
Bowl XXV in 1991, sung during the Gulf War and re-released as a
single after Sept. 11, 2001. It is also a reminder of how different
Houston's vocal range is from everyone else's.</TE>
<TE>   Some contestants are too operatic. Some swallow a crucial word.
Some change keys during the song (usually at "and the rockets' red
glare"), unable to follow the challenging range. Or they're too
shrill. Or their voices crack. Or they call the stars (instead of the
stripes) "broad." Or they groan, "Woooa'hhh, say does that
star-spangled banner" instead of the proper phrase, "Oh, say...." Or
they sing "for" the land of the free instead of "o'er." Or they slow
the pace so drastically -- one woman sings it in 2:03 -- that no
virtue can compensate.</TE>
<TE>   (There have been longer versions, and one is arguably the most
flamboyant national anthem ever sung: At the 1983 National Basketball
Assn. all-star game at the Forum, Marvin Gaye turned the crowd into
swaying, hand-clapping churchgoers with a 2:35 arrangement modeled on
his idiosyncratically languid R&amp;B style, with only the slightest hint
of the song's true rhythm.)</TE>
<TE>   These flaws make the rare complete version even more powerful to
the audition audience, which consists of the contestants and a
handful of friends and family.</TE>
<TE>   They are awed by the eighth contestant, a grade-school girl whose
command of the song brings applause the moment after she cuts loose
on "the land of the freeee...." The 22nd candidate, a young man in a
yellow University of Michigan football jersey and baggy jeans, draws
shouts and screams too, for his precision. The Millen twins go 37th,
dressed in matching red sweaters, trading solo lyrics, then bonding
on the back end of the song, nailing the ending as if it were an
Olympic gymnastic routine.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of contestants are simply unable to raise their vocal
range at the appropriate moment and give up. "That's OK!" the crowd
shouts. "Take your time! Keep going!"</TE>
<TE>   After more than two hours of this, the plaza is nearly deserted
and only a couple of entrants remain. There is a small moment of
spontaneity as two friends who registered to sing separately as
candidates 78 and 79 throw their hat into the ring as a duo and make
a lasting impression. An on-duty LAPD officer gives the day's last
rendition.</TE>
<TE>   Martin and three assistants retreat to the Clipper offices and
hash over the contestants, often ruling that one flaw outweighs an
otherwise acceptable performance. ("She changed keys, that means she
can't carry it." "He used several wrong words." "She had a great
voice but ...." "She kept looking down, looking around.")</TE>
<TE>   They love the grade-school girl, 11-year-old Emma Hunton, who,
unbeknownst to them, had performed in a touring performance of "Les
Miserables" for a year and a half. They're sold on the guy with the
Michigan jersey, Ronald Hodge Jr. They like the makeshift duo of
Manya Gulen and D'Andrea Glass, who'd performed near the end of the
day. They decide to book each for a Clipper regular-season game and
add the Millen twins to the list for an exhibition, which was
scheduled for the fourth Wednesday of the month.</TE>
<TE>   Not only is the game meaningless, it is competing with Game 4 of
the World Series, leaving the arena barely half filled -- a bad night
if you're expecting music execs. But this is the hand the girls have
been dealt, and they play it. Their parents, Steve and Mary Millen,
who have left (but not yet sold) their home in an Atlantic City
suburb, gambling on their daughters' talent, watch nervously. Steve
snaps pictures from courtside.</TE>
<TE>   Mary, sitting underneath the basket, finds her view blocked by the
Clipper and Milwaukee Buck players who stand on both sides of her
daughters. She tilts her head up and watches them, in burgundy
evening dresses, start in low register, singing their individual
verses a little uneasily but blending beautifully on the back half.
The applause is politely enthusiastic, no more.</TE>
<TE>   Where will this lead? Nobody knows. "A great experience," Sonia
says. "This music business is not an easy thing. We have to strive
for the best and keep in the race.... I wasn't nervous. I love big
crowds."</TE>
<TE>   Here's hoping Emma Hunton, the 11-year-old who'll perform before
the Nov. 24 Clippers-Houston Rockets game, does too. Just in case,
though, a pro like Emma has a backup plan: "Sometimes when I think
I'm going to be nervous, I wear bigger pants so nobody can see my
knees shake."</TE>

<TE>   Memorable anthem moments</TE>
<TE>   1968: Before the fifth game of the World Series in Detroit, Jose
Feliciano, accompanying himself on guitar, performs the anthem in a
Latin-folk style, at the time a shocking departure from tradition.
NBC gets 400 complaint calls, but a single of the performance hits
No. 50 on the charts.</TE>
<TE>   1969: Guitar legend Jimi Hendrix, a former Army paratrooper,
applies his sonic distortion to the anthem at Woodstock, creating a
powerful wordless protest against the Vietnam War.</TE>
<TE>   1983: Marvin Gaye, dressed in mirrored shades, puts the anthem
into another groove at the NBA all-star game in Inglewood. The crowd,
first stunned, grooves along.</TE>
<TE>   1990: Roseanne, apparently bent on career suicide, sings the
anthem off-key at a San Diego Padres game, spitting and grabbing her
crotch for emphasis. Then-President Bush calls it "a disgrace."</TE>
<TE>   1991: At Super Bowl XXV, against the backdrop of the Gulf War,
Whitney Houston and the Florida Orchestra lip- and finger-sync their
way through an emotional recording of the anthem in Tampa. Royalties
bail the orchestra out of a financial jam.</TE>

<HD>Visiting villas for the essence of Palladian style</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Merle Rubin</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The classical revival in architecture began in Renaissance Italy, but
its wide-ranging influence can be seen everywhere, from Buckingham
Palace to Thomas Jefferson's Monticello, George Washington's Mt.
Vernon and the White House. Among its distinguishing features:
symmetry, porticoes, pediments and columns. The man largely
responsible for inventing this architectural idiom was the 16th
century Italian stonemason-turned-architect Andrea Palladio
(1508-1580).</LD>
<LD>   Palladio was not the first architect to be inspired by the remains
of classical Roman architecture: Brunelleschi, Alberti, Bramante and
Raphael had also looked beyond the medieval Gothic style to the
earlier, cleaner but in many ways more sophisticated building style
of the Romans and, before them, the Greeks. But in Palladio, this
style found its most complete and enduring form of expression.</LD>
<TE>   The Palladian style seems easy to duplicate: Take a central hall,
add an imposing pediment and some stately columns, and presto, you've
got yourself a Palladian building. "In 1992," Witold Rybczynski tells
us, a Yale art historian and a Microsoft software engineer "devised a
computer program that was capable of generating innumerable
'Palladian' villa plans and facades according to predetermined
geometrical rules." But what impresses Rybczynski about Palladio's
work is its constant inventiveness. Far from rigidly adhering to a
few rules and formulas, Palladio was always improvising and coming up
with new solutions to the particular demands of each assignment.</TE>
<TE>   By the time he was well established, Palladio was designing
important buildings in the cities of Venice and Vicenza: churches,
palazzos and public buildings. But like most other beginning
architects through the centuries, he got his start with smaller
commissions for private homes in the suburbs and countryside.
Palladio built about 30 villas in the country around Venice, Vicenza
and Padua.</TE>
<TE>   Convinced that there's no substitute for seeing a building in
person, Rybczynski made it his mission to visit 10 that are still
standing and in relatively good repair. This book is his attempt not
only to convey something of that firsthand experience but also to
explain the historical, practical and aesthetic factors behind his
designs.</TE>
<TE>   There is certainly irony in the fact that Rybczynski insists the
villas must be seen in person yet writes a book telling us what they
look like. Undoubtedly, this book will be immensely useful as a guide
and handbook for anyone planning to make a tour of Palladian villas
in Italy. But how useful will it be to other readers with no such
plans? Although illustrated with Palladio's original floor plans and
Rybczynski's careful line drawings of the villas, the book contains
no photographs.</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, Rybczynski's approach works. His clear descriptions
of what he sees and his lucid explanations of Palladio's ideas and
methods enable the reader to see and understand the essence of this
architect's accomplishments, even if the reader does not happen to be
in Italy looking at a Palladian villa.</TE>
<TE>   Rybczynski's approach has a lot in common with the art of drawing,
as he characterizes it in a passage commenting on Palladio's
painstaking drawings of ancient Roman ruins: "Drawing, which involves
long periods of intense scrutiny, internalizes a subject (in a way
photography does not begin to approximate) ...." By drawing these
structures, Palladio came to understand them from the inside out.
Rybczynski's descriptive writing accomplishes a similar effect.</TE>
<TE>   Rybczynski, an architect, has pursued a second career as a writer
on architecture and related topics, from a prize-winning study of
environmentalist and park planner Frederick Olmstead ("A Clearing in
the Distance") to a history of the screwdriver and the screw ("One
Good Turn"). His abiding interest in the concept of home and the
reality of houses manifested itself in his 1986 book, "Home: A Short
History of an Idea," and his 1989 book, "The Most Beautiful House in
the World," the story of a house he built for himself. In considering
the achievement of Palladio, Rybczynski shows a keen understanding of
the exigencies of designing and building a house, as the
architect-builder (Palladio was both) tries to translate his
aesthetic vision into reality while taking account of the needs and
demands of the client.</TE>
<TE>   The book's title, "The Perfect House," is something of a misnomer,
or, rather, it is deliberately equivocal. In Rybczynski's view,
perfection in architecture is not an absolute, or even an ideal.
Cost, location, climate, the needs of the client and the availability
of materials are all factors that must be dealt with. Thus, the
"perfect" house is not some Platonic idea of a house but a pragmatic
compromise between vision and reality.</TE>
<TE>   "Of all the applied arts," declares Rybczynski, "architecture is
the least progressive -- that is, while engineering and technology
evolve, architecture itself, its forms and spaces, is constant. A
Renaissance fireplace is not as efficient as a modern gas furnace,
but a Renaissance building, judged purely architecturally, can be as
good as, or even better than, a modern one. Architecture, especially
great architecture, does not become obsolete."</TE>
<TE>   The extent to which the Palladian style has been copied, emulated
and quoted clearly testifies to the truth of that assertion.</TE>

<HD>Krieger's multihued play boosts the Philharmonic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Cariaga</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A great heritage of pianists living in Los Angeles exists, going back
at least to the 1940s and '50s, when Beverly Hills was home to Sergei
Rachmaninoff, Artur Rubinstein and Amparo and Jose Iturbi. Around the
same time, and later, an informal school of pianists-teachers
dominated the scene; that group included Ethel Leginska, Johana
Harris, Jakob Gimpel and Muriel Kerr.</LD>
<LD>   Today, important players are still resident on local university
campuses. For example, at least three world-class pianists are on the
faculty at the University of Southern California. Among these, young
(35) Norman Krieger appeared three times over the weekend with the
Los Angeles Philharmonic in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.</LD>
<LD>   Heard Friday night, Krieger, with spirited assistance from
associate conductor Miguel Harth-Bedoya and the orchestra, gave a
powerful performance of Liszt's E-flat Piano Concerto, a spontaneous
and resplendent reading.</LD>
<TE>   Krieger commands the full resources that make this vehicle work,
from potent strength to whispering pianissimos, including a variety
of pianistic touches that give the score its many colors.
Harth-Bedoya's collaboration on the podium was total. An honest
standing ovation followed the performance.</TE>
<TE>   The conductor chose to reverse the usual
overture-concerto-symphony order for this program, and it worked. He
began with the most personal and subtle of Brahms' symphonies, the
Third, in F, eschewing the bombast some bring to its opening, and
exposing throughout its inner life. The slow movement proved
unusually transparent and poignant, and the following Poco allegretto
reiterated the power of understatement. There was nothing willful in
the conductor's approach; the entire work emerged fluently and
naturally; all the instruments sang.</TE>
<TE>   The evening ended in a blaze of color in four Slavonic Dances by
Dvorak, scrappily played.</TE>

<HD>Trio has Francaix's number</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Cariaga</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For its third visit to the Southland, the Berlin-based Jacques
Thibaud String Trio brought along two colleagues and played two
quintets. But the real joy of the performance in Schoenberg Hall at
UCLA on Saturday night was its centerpiece, Jean Francaix's Trio
(1933), which the ensemble played exquisitely and from memory (the
trio usually plays its repertory from memory).</LD>
<LD>   Utterly charming, engaging and lighthearted, the piece, written
when the composer was merely 21 years old, reiterates the
irrepressibility and urbanity of the era of its composition. It lives
up to annotator Nicholas Gordon's description of music that "delights
in the play of stylistic manners, taking irony as an artistic virtue
in itself rather than a source of expressive conflict."</LD>
<LD>   The surrounding program also gave pleasure, if not quite as much
delight. With Brazilian pianist Caio Pagano and Japanese bassist
Masatoshi Saito, the trio -- violinist Burkhard Maiss, violist Philip
Douvier and cellist Uwe Hirth -- opened the evening with Johann
Nepomuk Hummel's jolly Piano Quintet in E-flat. Hummel, a
contemporary of Beethoven, wrote glibly, and his music always seems
to contain too many notes, to use a famous phrase from the play
"Amadeus."</LD>
<TE>   This aggressive performance was accomplished but often overstated,
particularly by the overachieving pianist.</TE>
<TE>   Schubert's "Trout" Quintet, which the trio also played here with
other colleagues last year, emerged with more subtlety than did the
Hummel.</TE>

<HD>A joyful, memorable evening with Chick Corea</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chick Corea has been rightfully praised throughout his long and
productive career for his imagination, versatility and sheer
musicality. What has often been overlooked is another, equally vital
quality -- one that adds luster to everything he does: the sheer joy
of making music.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday night at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill, Corea kicked off a
too-brief three-night run fronting what he calls his Elektric Band.
Consisting of saxophonist Eric Marienthal, guitarist Frank Gambale,
bassist Jimmy Earl replacing original member John Patitucci and
drummer Dave Weckl, the band was a state-of-the-art collection of
contemporary jazz players. Simply playing on their own, they could
have provided an entertaining evening of cutting-edge music. But with
Corea's ever enthusiastic presence -- as well, of course, as his
extraordinary improvisational inventiveness -- bringing life and
passion to the proceedings, it became a musical event to remember.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to his effervescent leadership, Corea offered a
program of music tailored to reach across stylistic genres: his own
hard-driving "Rumble" and lighter-toned "Trance Dance," Jimmy Heath's
classic bebop line "C.T.A." and a lovely, classical-sounding
piano-alto saxophone duet with Marienthal. On the opening "Rumble,"
he moved to the front of the stage, picked up an over-the-shoulder
keyboard and ripped off a series of dynamic solos, using a pitch
wheel to bend his notes with the slip-sliding alacrity of a rock
guitarist.</TE>
<TE>   On "C.T.A.", he shifted to the jazz-textured sounds of the Fender
Rhodes electric piano, moving to acoustic grand piano for other
numbers: repeated displays of versatility compounded with the obvious
pleasure he experienced, and communicated, on each of the keyboards.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of rock guitarists, Gambale, who is surely one of the
fastest-fingered instrumentalists anywhere, added a series of
highflying, wildly wailing solos, directly contrasting with the
bop-oriented offerings of Marienthal. Earl, playing six-string bass,
provided several heated solos and a consistently solid rhythmic
foundation, while Weckl's torrential surge of percussion was filled
with fascinating snippets of timbre and color.</TE>
<TE>   Did the overflow crowd show up primarily because Corea is a
high-ranking member of jazz royalty? Perhaps. But what they
experienced had less to do with name value than with skill,
inventiveness and Corea's ineffable contact with the heart of musical
creativity.</TE>

<HD>After the surprise, a gradual welcome</HD>
<DH>At a mystery concert, the rich melodies and lyrics of a
Colombian newcomer eventually win over the crowd.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Agustin Gurza</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was billed as a mystery concert. Fans knew where and when: Friday
night at House of Blues in Anaheim. But they didn't know who. They
were promised free admission and a major Latin music act.</LD>
<LD>   At showtime, a hostess teases the crowd by inviting it to guess
the evening's mystery performer.</LD>
<LD>   "Skakira!" shouts a wishful thinker.</LD>
<TE>   "Rush!" ventures a wisecracker.</TE>
<TE>   "Frida Kahlo!" says someone expecting a seance.</TE>
<TE>   With no introduction, out comes the band: three crack
percussionists on drums, congas, timbales and tambora -- the last a
wooden, kettle-like folkloric instrument; a wiry, long-haired wizard
on electric guitar; and a staid but skilled woman on electric bass.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, a singer emerges, looking like a cross between a rocker
and a Santero: frizzy reddish hair, shiny black pants, necklaces of
beads and leather. He's carrying a small curved horn that appears
borrowed from an Alpine yodeler.</TE>
<TE>   The band launches into an unsettling song about an irresponsible
louse named "Juancho." Ripping guitars and thundering percussion
disturb the character's comfort while the singer screams to shake him
out of his hammock and wake him from his indifference and
intolerance:</TE>
<TE>   "Y tu in-to-ler-an-ciaaaaa !!"</TE>
<TE>   The crowd is unmoved. The singer finally speaks: "We come from
Colombia, and it's an honor to be with you."</TE>
<TE>   "Who are you?" shouts a voice.</TE>
<TE>   It's Cabas, unmistakably.</TE>
<TE>   This talented Colombian newcomer seeking to make a name for
himself had just flown 13 hours from Buenos Aires to appear at this
invitation-only promotional event.</TE>
<TE>   Sponsored by Miller Genuine Draft, the mystery concert series is
in its sixth year, having featured major alternative bands (Cafe
Tacuba, Aterciopelados, Jaguares) at small venues from New York to
L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Guests win invitations mostly through contests. For an artist like
Cabas, with his challenging fusion of traditional rhythms and
aggressive rock, the show provides a chance for much needed exposure.</TE>
<TE>   It also poses a risk. The crowd Friday didn't quite know what to
make of him at first. Concertgoers' reserved reception unnerved the
band, and Cabas struggled to connect.</TE>
<TE>   But then the singer stepped up to an electric piano and played a
soft and lovely intro to his tropical hit "Ana Maria," a song of
overpowering desire.</TE>
<TE>   The fans finally clicked with what makes Cabas so compelling --
rich melodies, smart lyrics, unvarnished emotion and accomplished
musicianship. The singer-songwriter, who also plays the flute-like
gaita, performed with the same group that appears on his debut EMI
Latin album, one of the year's best. On stage, they displayed an
exciting improvisational spirit, part salsa, part blues, part Latin
rock.</TE>
<TE>   And they were just the opening act. The headliner, Mexico's
excellent Elefante, did only two numbers because its lead singer had
visa problems and never showed. Cabas pitched in on Elefante's catchy
hit "Asi es la Vida" (That's Life), reading lyrics scribbled on a
page.</TE>
<TE>   The young Colombian returned with his band for a rousing encore
that left the crowd cheering.</TE>
<TE>   No mystery there anymore.</TE>

<HD>Keita's energy overcomes muddy Royce Hall acoustics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Close to the end of his 90-minute set at UCLA's Royce Hall on
Saturday, Salif Keita, the veteran singer from Mali, picked up his
microphone -- along with its stand -- and launched into a soaring
declamatory vocal.</LD>
<LD>   His high, penetrating voice, one of the marvels of African music,
broke through the morass of low-frequency sound that dominated the
program. Alternating intense high notes with rapid, dramatic phrases,
his performance came alive, a hypnotically gripping manifestation of
the rich storytelling tradition of Malian griots.</LD>
<LD>   The balance of the show was something else. Although Keita came
out at the opening to offer a few quiet guitar and voice samples from
his new acoustically oriented album, "Moffou," the program quickly
moved into what was essentially a collection of music for
dancing-in-place.</LD>
<TE>   The evening ended with a number in which crowds of audience
members eluded Royce's determined usher crew and climbed on stage to
wiggle and twist among Keita and his 11 musicians and singers.</TE>
<TE>   Although the program was nominally acoustic, superficially
reflecting the laid-back intent of "Moffou," the amplification was so
loud that results differed hardly at all from the more electronically
oriented programs Keita has offered in the past. And the Royce sound
system's continuing over-emphasis on bass and low-frequency sounds
largely buried Keita's vocals while wiping out the subtle presence of
various acoustic African instruments.</TE>
<TE>   That was no problem at all for most of the crowd, who -- given a
mandate to dance by Keita shortly after his quiet opening -- remained
on their feet for the entire program. Seemingly oblivious to the
muddy sound and the absence of musical subtleties, they appeared
content to cheer the two female singers and dance back and forth to
the music's energized, but repetitive, bass-dominated rhythms.</TE>

<HD>'SPIDER-MAN' BREAKS RECORDS ON HOME FRONT</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Americans spent millions at movie theaters this weekend but were more
interested in inviting a heavily marketed webslinger into their
homes, as "Spider-Man," already the year's top-grossing film, broke
records for a home entertainment release.</LD>
<LD>   It sold an estimated 7 million DVDs and videocassettes Friday, its
initial day in stores, and Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment is
projecting that 11 million discs and VHS copies will have been sold
in North America during its first weekend. That would bring retail
revenue for the Tobey Maguire-starring action-adventure to $190
million, an industry record.</LD>
<LD>   "Spider-Man" not only bested Tim Allen's holiday comedy, "The
Santa Clause 2," which took in an estimated $29 million, but exceeded
the $100 million combined total of the top 10 films.</LD>
<TE>   "We did about 20% better than we were hoping," said Benjamin
Feingold, president of Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment. The
studio estimated that it spent $40 million promoting "Spider-Man."
That does not include additional expenditures by promotional
partners, which executives claimed were worth as much as $60 million,
but the actual figure is somewhat lower. As a measure of the studio's
high expectations, it has shipped an unprecedented 26 million units
to stores in North America -- with about 75% of those units in the
DVD format.</TE>
<TE>   About 80% of the copies sold this weekend were on DVD, Feingold
said. Feingold said the Motion Picture Assn of America estimates that
41% of a movie's total revenues comes from home entertainment -- a
category that is up 21% for the first six months of this year.</TE>
<TE>   The minimum advertised retail price for the DVD is $19.95 and
$15.95 for VHS. Wholesale prices for the industry as a whole range
from an estimated $14 to $18, and some dealers receive volume
discounts, industry sources said. The bulk of the wholesale figure,
less the cost of manufacturing and distribution, goes to the studio.</TE>
<TE>   "Spider-Man" broke the one-day home entertainment sales records
held by Disney/Pixar's "Monsters, Inc." which was released Sept. 17.</TE>
<TE>   The computer-animated feature sold 5 million combined units on its
first day In its first week, sales reached 11 million copies.Last
November, DreamWorks' animated film "Shrek" broke all the
sell-through figures from the past six years, selling more than 7
million VHS and DVD units in its first three days of release,
generating $110 million at retail.</TE>
<TE>   No title has yet to break "The Lion King's" VHS record. In pre-DVD
1995, the Disney animated classic sold 20 million videocassettes in
its first week.</TE>
<TE>   Breaking records is nothing new for "Spider-Man." Last May, the
film scored the biggest opening weekend in Hollywood history, raking
in $114.8 million. To date, "Spider-Man" has garnered more than $800
million worldwide in box office receipts.</TE>
<TE>   The sequel, which reunites director Sam Raimi and Maguire, is
scheduled to start filming early next year.</TE>

<LD>When the Country Music Assn. hands out awards Wednesday at 8 p.m. on
CBS, watch to see whether the country establishment honors
understanding or retribution as the better response to Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   Alan Jackson's thought-provoking hit "Where Were You (When the
World Stopped Turning)" is vying for single and song of the year with
Toby Keith's saber-rattling "Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The
Angry American)."</LD>
<LD>   Both were monster hits on country radio and beyond, and helped
give the singers the biggest albums of their careers. The two are
competing in the association's male vocalist, album and entertainer
of the year categories as well.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a very strong chance this will be the year of Alan
Jackson," says Lon Helton, country music editor for Radio &amp; Records,
a trade publication. "He's had not only two of the biggest songs out
there in the past year, but he had a great tour and did a lot of
other things.... It's hard to imagine a better year than he enjoyed."</TE>
<TE>   Unless, that is, you're Kenny Chesney. The Tennessee native scored
a No. 1 debut on the pop and country album chart in May with his "No
Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems" album, and the highest-grossing country
tour of the year, selling more than $24 million in tickets to outpace
perennial champs such as Jackson, Brooks &amp; Dunn and George Strait.</TE>
<TE>   That added up to a breakthrough year for Chesney, and the Country
Music Assn. will want to recognize that. But in what category?</TE>
<TE>   Keith also graduated to a new level of stardom in 2002 thanks to
his "Red, White and Blue" single, "Unleashed" album (which debuted
atop the pop and country charts in August) and those ubiquitous
long-distance service commercials.</TE>
<TE>   "The entertainer category is so strong," Helton says. "It shows
you what we in country have done in the last year when two artists
elevated themselves from solid performers, solid album-sellers and
hit single-makers to that next level where they've become known
outside the country music world. To me that's really what the
entertainer of the year signifies."</TE>
<TE>   Where does that leave the race for entertainer of the year?</TE>
<TE>   "That's a good one to watch," says R.J. Curtis at L.A. country
station KZLA-FM (93.9). "I think Jackson has a better chance at
winning song and single. I think the horse race for entertainer is
between Brooks &amp; Dunn and Chesney, and Chesney did have such a great
year I have a feeling he may win it."</TE>

<LD>The genius stroke of the Rolling Stones tour is the nightly shifts of
songs pulled at will from a war chest of 140 tunes worked up for this
run. On Saturday night at Edison International Field in Anaheim, the
approach kept fans happily guessing what was coming next.</LD>
<LD>   Keith Richards pouring himself into "The Worst" from "Voodoo
Lounge" and the band's heartfelt take on Dylan's "Like a Rolling
Stone" were the closest things to surprises. The set (listed below)
contained 12 songs not played during Thursday's concert at Staples
Center. As for the sold-out Wiltern show tonight, it's anybody's
guess. Saturday, the Stones sang and played like the world champion
rockers they became decades ago, but with an in-the- moment passion
of a band that still had something to prove.</LD>

<HD>Talk about aging well -- Eloise is still only 6</HD>
<DH>The Plaza's favorite moppet makes her first appearance in
40 years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hilary E. MacGregor</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Come up to the pool," says Mr. Hilary Knight.</LD>
<LD>   He stands natty and very New York in the lobby of the Four Seasons
at Beverly Hills, a book tucked under his arm. Its watery blue cover
peeks out from under his elbow like a spreading stain.</LD>
<LD>   "I love these luxury hotels," he says sotto voce en route to the
elevator. "All the combs and everything "</LD>
<TE>   He sounds as if he would like to steal one. Oooooooo, Eloise would
absolutely love those combs.</TE>
<TE>   He takes a breakfast table by the turquoise rooftop pool, more
books piled beside his omelet. It's an overcast Los Angeles day, here
among the blue and white striped cabanas, the palms and ferns, on the
fourth floor of the Four Seasons. Yesterday, Knight met with Esther
Williams, the legendary MGM Swimming Star. Knight has already been
swimming this morning -- at 6:30, when the moon was still out.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to do everything that has to do with water on this
trip," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Knight, 76, has illustrated more than 50 books, done Broadway show
posters, contributed to high-end catalogs such as Neiman Marcus' "The
Book" and is a staff artist for Vanity Fair. But he is best known as
the illustrator of Kay Thompson's beloved Eloise series. He is here
in Los Angeles to promote "Eloise Takes a Bawth" (Simon &amp; Schuster),
the first new Eloise book to be published in 40 years. Thus the stack
on his breakfast table.</TE>
<TE>   Born 50 years ago as an impish voice Thompson would use to
entertain friends -- and first immortalized in "Kay Thompson's
Eloise: A Book for Precocious Grownups" -- Eloise is a saucy
6-year-old who lives in the Plaza Hotel in New York with Nanny, her
pug dog Weenie (who looks like a cat) and her turtle Skipperdee.
(Only the Plaza allows turtles!) She skibbles and skidders about the
halls having grand adventures -- feeding her mother's attorney rubber
candy, hiding in high-up holes in the Grand Ballroom, torturing her
tutor and ordering everything possible from room service. (Charge it
please and thank you very much!)</TE>
<TE>   In "Bawth," as Eloise lolls in her bathtub at the Plaza and
indulges in aquatic fantasies -- water-skiing with her pet turtle and
traveling the seas in a pirate ship -- and she floods the entire
hotel on the night of the Venetian Masked Ball. But o my lord
calamity turns to good fortune, as canals are awash and gondolas
float and the Venetian Masked Ball is the sensation of the social
season!</TE>
<TE>   The fold-out, yard-long illustration of the ball is a riot of
color and detail and full of secret jokes that only Knight can
explain: There is Esther Williams, atop a spout of golden water, and
there is Diana Vreeland, with a gold alligator about her neck. There
is Dame Edna fleeing a suitor on the covered bridge. And there is
Knight, a Pirandello pirouetting on the tip of a gondola with his
cat, Ruff (identifiable by his bellybutton), balanced on the nose of
his mask. And look closely, oooooo, very closely -- there are
Eloises, fully 26 of them. There, among the synchronized swimmers,
and there, longing for a cheese globe, and there, o look, grasping
for a flask of imported Fontana Bernini with apricots. Oooooooo,
Eloise absolutely loves Fontana Bernini with apricots.</TE>
<TE>   It becomes clear, over breakfast at the Four Seasons, that Eloise
lives on in Knight.</TE>
<TE>   He strips off his shoes and socks for a photographer and dangles
his feet in the hotel fountain -- even flicks some water into the air
with his toes -- just as a grumpy-looking security guard strides by.</TE>
<TE>   "Kay's voice is always buzzing around in my head. And Kay's voice
is Eloise," he says. "She is totally part of my head, my arms, my
fingers, my brain." Indeed, there is something of the illustrated
Eloise in the flick of Knight's wet toe.</TE>
<TE>   Those who knew Thompson say that in her later years, she sometimes
felt the mania for Eloise overtook her life and overshadowed her. Not
so Knight. He embraces the imperious 6-year-old Napoleon.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't be here today if not for Eloise," he says. "I have
done lots of things I think are much better, but you are always
famous for one thing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The birth of Eloise</TE>
<TE>   Kay Thompson was a flamboyant musical performer who trained vocal
greats such as Lena Horne and Judy Garland. According to a 1996
Vanity Fair article on Thompson, Eloise began as a "vocal riff" among
friends. She grew into an alter ego, allowing Thompson to express
contrarian thoughts in a bratty, childish voice. One day, late for a
photo session at a friend's house in Los Angeles, Thompson drove
across a golf course to save time. "Who do you think you are, coming
here five minutes late,' " the friend reportedly said when he saw her
roll up on the grass. "I am Eloise. I am 6," Thompson responded.</TE>
<TE>   That became the first line of her first book, retitled "The
Absolutely Essential Eloise," published in 1955 with illustrations by
Knight. It became a bestselling sensation, and the two collaborated
on three sequels, "Eloise in Paris" (1957), "Eloise at Christmastime"
(1958) and "Eloise in Moscow" (1959).</TE>
<TE>   As perfect as this collaboration seems, Knight wasn't her first
choice. He says Thompson met with Andy Warhol and the prize-winning
Swiss children's book illustrator Tomi Ungerer in her efforts to find
someone to draw Eloise. They didn't get on.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what frustrated her was she couldn't draw," Knight says
of Thompson, whom he describes as "very, very smart and interested in
everything -- politics, fashion, art. She would have liked to have
been able to draw the books herself."</TE>
<TE>   Knight was introduced to her by his neighbor, D.D. Dixon, a
fashion editor at Harper's Bazaar. He was 27. Thompson was in her
50s. "She liked working with me," he says. "I was very easy because I
was totally in awe of her."</TE>
<TE>   Knight's parents, Clayton Knight and Katharine Sturges, were
artist-writers, and he was inspired by the illustrators he found in
their library and on the bookshelves of his bedroom -- Edmund Dulac's
"exotic fantasies" ("Tales From the Arabian Nights," "The Rubaiyat of
Omar Khayyam") and Ernest H.Shepard ("The Wind in the Willows").</TE>
<TE>   From 1960 to 1964, Thompson and Knight worked on and off in Rome,
where Thompson had an apartment, on "Eloise Takes a Bawth." But in
the mid-'60s Thompson, a temperamental perfectionist, removed the
three Eloise sequels from print and refused to allow "Bawth" to be
published.</TE>
<TE>   When she died in 1998, the rights passed back to her estate, which
passed them back to her publisher. The three sequels have since been
reissued. And "Eloise Takes a Bawth" has just appeared in bookstores
for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Eloise is Knight's baby. Knight says the revival began
with the Vanity Fair story on Thompson and a request for
illustrations. He began digging through his New York apartment, where
stacks of his portfolios overflow from closets and shelves. He found
illustrations he had almost forgotten about. "All I had were hundreds
of sketches," he says. "None of them were finished with."</TE>
<TE>   After the story ran, which included some of the
never-before-published pencil sketches for "Bawth," Vanity Fair
editor Graydon Carter hired Knight. "I want you to draw just like you
drew Eloise," he told him. That forced Knight to brush up on the
pen-and-ink technique he used for Eloise, which he hadn't used for
nearly 40 years. Then the estate consented to publish "Bawth." But
the text was unfinished.</TE>
<TE>   "That is when I went to Mart Crowley," Knight says. Crowley, a
playwright who wrote "The Boys in the Band," had worked with his
friend Thompson on a never-completed book titled "The Fox and the
Fig." "We need you," Knight told Crowley. "You knew her. You know the
sound of Eloisiana." Crowley helped flesh out the story. As it says
on the cover of "Bawth": "Additional plumbing by Mart Crowley."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Hollywood jaunt?</TE>
<TE>   So where would Eloise stay if she came to Los Angeles? The Beverly
Hills Hotel, the Peninsula, Chateau Marmont?</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't put her here," Knight says. He surveys the cabanas
that look like forts, the chairs that look like trampolines, the pool
that looks like a big bathtub. "Her base is the Plaza."</TE>
<TE>   But Eloise did almost take a trip to Los Angeles. In 1956, Kay
Thompson was here shooting "Funny Face," in which she played a
fashion editor modeled on Diana Vreeland. The musical starred Fred
Astaire and Audrey Hepburn and began with Thompson's opening number,
"Think Pink." Knight was here too, doing preliminary sketches for a
magazine piece on "Eloise in Hollywood." It was never published.
Could those sketches still be hiding in a closet too?</TE>
<TE>   "It never developed into a story," Knight says. "But I did lots of
research, drawing mechanical cameras, make-up rooms, Fred Astaire's
toupee taped to a mannequin head -- things that would interest
Eloise."</TE>
<TE>   Now his mind is revving up, the ideas are coming, you can
practically see the sketches of Eloise sprouting from his head as he
surveys the L.A. skyline.</TE>
<TE>   "She might have a little bungalow somewhere with Nanny," he
begins. "Because she would be traveling to the studios. She might
have her own dressing room...."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe he'll put aside his fork and start scribbling on a napkin.</TE>
<TE>   "[William Randolph] Hearst built Marion Davies a little cottage on
the soundstage. I think she moved the whole thing from MGM to Warner
Bros. when she left. Eloise might do that.... She might have a beach
cabana. She would do what moguls do."</TE>
<TE>   He pauses. "She would definitely have a cottage on the set," he
says. "A mobile cottage...."</TE>
<TE>   Ooooooooooo, Eloise would absolutely love L.A.!</TE>

<LD>I had just finished talking on the phone to a friend who was saying
how lucky I was to be working at home when I heard a funny gagging
sound. The dog had thrown up on my rug. Calls, even from friends, are
distracting enough when I'm working on a column. I didn't need a sick
dog to frighten away my muse.</LD>
<LD>   Normally, I don't clean up animal emissions of any kind. I have
perfected the art of pretending not to see what the dog might do in
another part of the house, but when he violates my work space, I'm
forced to take care of it myself, more's the pity.</LD>
<LD>   Don't get me wrong. There are many advantages to being among the
10 million or 20 million Americans (depending on whose figure you
believe) classified as telecommuters or off-site employees, which are
terms created by those who work at home for those who work at home.</LD>
<TE>   Whatever the number, experts predict that it will double in the
next several years. That's because there are perks to being an
off-site worker. Writers, for instance, can write in their underwear
if they have a mind to, which they cannot do in a conventional
workplace. I write fully clothed most of the time, but that's just
me.</TE>
<TE>   As a home worker, I like the idea that I don't have to risk my
life in the demolition derby known as the Santa Monica Freeway. I did
that for years and it was only due to my passive-aggressive driving
techniques that I managed to survive. Today, for instance, I heard
that traffic was crazy on the 10 because of a dead pelican in the
road. A dead pelican? Of course.</TE>
<TE>   I am actually a semi-telecommuter. I work at home three days a
week writing and researching and spend two days interviewing,
observing and wandering, which I do a lot of. Sometimes I work nights
or weekends, but the telestatisticians haven't gotten around to
factoring that in yet.</TE>
<TE>   Whenever I do hit the road, I work it out so that I don't have to
drive during commute hours. That is not always possible, since they
seem to begin at about 4 a.m. and last until 3 a.m. the following
day. There are very few people willing to be interviewed between 3
and 4 in the morning, even in Hollywood, unless you're sleeping with
them.</TE>
<TE>   I began working at home when I read about a growing concern over
something called "desk rage." It involves erratic behavior by
stressed-out office workers who occasionally commit violence against
their colleagues. Working at home would at least save me from some
unwired nut coming at me with his staple gun. No one ever tries to
kill me at home.</TE>
<TE>   Innovation is never without its moneymakers. Telecommuting has
spawned new industries. Companies that design work spaces and their
furniture make millions. Color schemes dazzle the eye. Euro-classic
desks and acid-etched glass complement rooms built to house
off-siters.</TE>
<TE>   My workroom is filled with the basic conveniences: a computer, a
printer, a copier, a fax machine, two phone lines and some objects
called books. I am, in fact, surrounded by books. I collect them the
way Renfield collected flies, the difference being that Renfield,
Dracula's mad assistant, ate the flies; I don't eat books. I do not
have Euro-classic furniture or acid-etched windows. I have a chair I
bought at Staples and a desk I've had forever. My walls are decorated
with must-do notes. Some have been there since the last century. I
get by without a Lifto chrome and glass desk lamp by Benjamin Thut or
an Antonio Citterio scratch-resistant polycarbonate filing cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   I do, however, have a stereo, which I rarely play while creating
columns. There's a different rhythm to writing about crime and
poverty for a newspaper than there is to, say, writing about the
importance of butter for a food magazine. On freelance weekends I
play classical music, but newspaper writing requires a kind of grim
silence.</TE>
<TE>   When I first set up my home office, I received a call from someone
at the paper who said she had to come out to see if I was
ergonomically correct. It's crazy, I guess, but what popped into my
head was that it might involve a colonoscopy, so I said no way. But
when she explained that it was to prevent carpal tunnel syndrome, I
said OK.</TE>
<TE>   I'm happy, I suppose, except for all the distractions, like the
dog throwing up, which he does when he wants attention. He used to
just bark, which was noisier but cleaner. I may have to buy a faux
neo-Roman polycarbonate self-cleaning designer rug to handle that.
I'm sure they're available.</TE>

<HD>Vivid 'Syringa' has few surprises</HD>
<DH>Pamela Gien's 90-minute memory play has little that's new
to say about apartheid.</DH>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Syringa Tree," Pamela Gien's one-woman show now at the Pasadena
Playhouse, is said to have begun as an exercise in a Los Angeles
acting class taught by the show's director, Larry Moss. The exercise
involved turning to another student in the class and telling a
personal story. Gien summoned up a haunting personal tale from her
childhood in South Africa, and the seed of "The Syringa Tree" was
planted.</LD>
<LD>   This backstage detail would be of little interest except that it
seems relevant in assessing what Gien (and two other actresses, in
nightly rotation) is now doing onstage in Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   "The Syringa Tree," a 90-minute memory play retracing its author's
privileged childhood in apartheid-era Johannesburg, comes off as an
extended acting exercise that is fitfully successful as such but that
never grows into a dramatic story with any momentum or compelling
plot line.</LD>
<TE>   The piece could also be described as an overwrought
autobiographical essay given a multi-voiced reading by an actress
good enough to have appeared onstage at the New York Shakespeare
Festival, the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass., and the
Los Angeles Theatre Center.</TE>
<TE>   Its title an homage to the flora of the African continent that
still bellows a siren song to its expatriates, "The Syringa Tree" is
a collage of scenes really, fitted together in a rough poetic
assemblage that is not always easy to follow and never seems to be
headed anywhere in particular except to remind us of the tragic
collision between the native peoples of Africa and the white
Europeans who subjugated them -- for a time.</TE>
<TE>   The scenes are narrated by Gien as a 6-year-old (here given the
name Elizabeth) and played out on a single set, a concave scrim lit
with an abstract, primordial pattern suggesting a prehistoric rock
face. Hanging against the scrim is a child's swing to remind us of
the immediate time frame of the play and its point of view.</TE>
<TE>   Choosing a 6-year-old narrator offers Gien the chance to
reconstruct the unnatural state of racial oppression through a
child's uncomprehending eyes, but the chirping schoolgirl voice she
employs as Elizabeth is a problem, pushing her toward the realm of
unwanted caricature. She does better with the bass notes she finds to
embody her beloved housekeeper, Salamina, and other adults, black and
white.</TE>
<TE>   In all, Gien plays the parts of 24 different people, including her
mother, father and brother, as well as maids and taxi drivers. Her
father -- or at least the father of the narrator -- was a doctor who,
as was the custom of the time, used separate rooms for examining
black patients and white. When Salamina's daughter is born right
there in front of Elizabeth in her home, we learn they must keep the
baby a secret because by law she has no right to live outside the
black township and would be taken from Salamina by the authorities.</TE>
<TE>   This and other outrageous indignities are recalled by Gien's
immature narrator and then expanded into real time as the characters
come to life in a rainbow of accents more notable for her use of them
than her ability to make them always understood.</TE>
<TE>   The curse of racial prejudice hanging over South Africa is very
much the main theme here and takes on tragic consequences when
Salamina's daughter is later gunned down by police during the Soweto
riots and Elizabeth's grandfather is hacked to death on his farm by a
black freedom fighter from Rhodesia.</TE>
<TE>   The episodes she builds to dramatize these horrors are in
themselves disturbing and full of sorrow. They are vivid anecdotes,
but they remain anecdotes, separate from a larger whole we might call
art.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to reckon with the knowledge that "The Syringa Tree" won
the 2001 Obie Award for the best play produced off Broadway in New
York, one thinks: Hasn't all this been said before and so much better
by Athol Fugard and Jon Robin Baitz in the theater and by Nadine
Gordimer, Rian Milan and others in prose? There is little new about
the way Gien has used incidents in her own life to revisit this sadly
familiar dark terrain.</TE>
<TE>   She brings an unmistakable passion to the subject of her familial
connection to a troubled homeland. Yet other than the sound of a
gunshot and a scream or two, there is not a single surprise in the
entire 90 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   One-person shows are tough. If the subject is the life of a famous
person as was the case with Ron Silver becoming the rock impresario
Bill Graham in "Bill Graham Presents" at the Canon a few years ago,
they at least carry a built-in curiosity factor for what they will
reveal about the late and great. Anna Deavere Smith's remarkable
one-woman journalistic reconstructions of topical events have the
built-in drama not only of her memorable characterizations but also
of her provocative lines of inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   "The Syringa Tree," for all its politically correct intentions,
looks drab by comparison. It remains an exercise in personal
soul-searching that pulses and vibrates with exotic, far-off sounds
but ultimately doesn't arrive at a place of much discovery for the
audience.</TE>
<TE>   Actresses Gin Hammond and Eva Kaminsky will rotate in the role
with Gien every third performance.</TE>

<HD>L.A. to get an upgrade in its fashion show scene</HD>
<DH>A new weeklong event will be at downtown's Standard hotel
in April.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Booth Moore</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>7th on Sixth, the production company that organizes New York's
biannual Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week, announced plans to launch a
similar event here, during a cocktail reception Friday attended by
some of L.A.'s best-known designers, including Richard Tyler, Rick
Owens, Randolph Duke and Jeremy Scott.</LD>
<LD>   Representatives from 7th say their aim is to use the event, set to
take place April 1 to 4, to bring some order to L.A.'s runway shows,
now held in far-flung venues with less-than-professional production
values.</LD>
<LD>   "We've been watching the creativity and energy of the L.A.
designers and the resurgence of the downtown area," 7th executive
director Fern Mallis said at a reception held on the rooftop of the
downtown Standard hotel. "And we realized that the talent here should
be galvanized to help make L.A. a fashion destination."</LD>
<TE>   Mercedes-Benz Shows L.A. will take place at the Standard. Events
will be held in three parts of the hotel, including a tent in the
parking lot that will seat 300 to 400 people.</TE>
<TE>   The runways will have professional lighting and sound for
photographs and video. Mallis said a steering committee of fashion
and style leaders has been formed to choose which designers will be
featured.</TE>
<TE>   The shows will be staffed by volunteers from the Fashion Institute
of Design and Merchandising, and one show a day will be underwritten
by Mercedes-Benz. Mallis said in most cases designers will be charged
for the venues, which will be less expensive to rent than the tents
in New York's Bryant Park, which start at about $30,000.</TE>
<TE>   Tyler said he will probably show at least one of his collections
in L.A. next season. "In 1995, we decided to show in New York because
we had to. There were no venues here," said the designer, who has a
store on Beverly Boulevard and is known mostly for designing
red-carpet gowns but also has a lower-priced sportswear line.</TE>
<TE>   In L.A., the opportunity for crossover with Hollywood is
limitless, Mallis said. "We know how important celebrity attendance
is to the shows in New York. It does bring an extra layer of
publicity."</TE>
<TE>   The dates were chosen to dovetail with the California Market
Center's fall season market dates. The downtown showroom center
already draws thousands of buyers to L.A. to shop largely moderately
priced lines.</TE>

<HD>Pets across the pond</HD>
<DH>To protect against rabies, England quarantines animals
arriving from the U.S. for 6 months. A possible repeal cheers pets'
best friends.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patt Morrison</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>London</LD>
<LD>   All the scores of weeping American children who move here every
year and have to lock up their beloved pets or leave them behind....</LD>
<LD>   All the great and glitzy of America too -- Elizabeth Taylor
anchoring a rented yacht in the Thames just for her dogs, David
Hockney choosing to paint in California rather than in his homeland
because of his dachshunds, a diplomat who had to think hard about
accepting the ambassadorship at the Court of St. James's, all because
of this island nation's stringent, century-old rabies quarantine.</LD>
<TE>   Now all that could be a thing of the past, consigned to the kitty
litter bin of history.</TE>
<TE>   The British government, which raised hopes and spirits of
peripatetic pet lovers this summer by letting it be known that it
might roll back the quarantine requirement for the United States and
Canada "subject to satisfactory conclusions" to its research, says it
will announce its findings this month. A paws-up ruling on a "pet
passport" program could allow U.S. pets into Great Britain without
the harrowing six-month "no-walkies" sentence of solitary confinement
in small cages. That law has prohibited quarantined pets -- even
guide dogs -- from so much as sniffing the soil of Britain and forced
owners who want to cuddle to climb into the cages with their
critters.</TE>
<TE>   In a nation that loves its pets enough to allow them on public
transit, thousands of foreign pets have been sentenced to time in
government-approved kennels, and dozens have died there and
thereafter -- not from rabies but from ailments, stress and just
plain loneliness. (Precise numbers are hard to come by, but in the
three decades preceding the lifting of the quarantine for selected
European countries, more than 200,000 dogs were caged.) To pet
parents among the quarter-million Americans living in the U.K., and
to others who'd like to settle here with menage and menagerie, the
new program would be not only welcome but a "what took you so long"
cause for celebration. Take the word of a former ambassador.</TE>
<TE>   "I talked about it by kidding on the square, kidding by being
serious. I would say that I thought [the quarantine] was the biggest
obstacle to improving Anglo-American relations," says Raymond Seitz,
appointed by the first President George Bush, and the first career
diplomat to hold the ambassadorship in modern times. Seitz loves his
dogs, mostly mutts; he devoted a chapter to them in his memoir, "Over
Here," and became a founding member of a British organization,
Passport for Pets, that has lobbied to change the quarantine he
characterizes -- in language not remotely diplomatic -- to be
"ludicrous, awful and dreadful," serving "no obvious purpose" in an
age of vaccines and med-tech.</TE>
<TE>   Seitz's own three-time shuttle diplomacy to Britain meant giving
one dog away to friends -- "that was excruciating" -- and locking
down others in "the slammer." When he was offered the ambassadorship,
his wife's first reaction was: What about the dogs? "I think for her
it was a close call as to whether we should come back here and put
the animals back in the slammer, one of them for the second time."</TE>
<TE>   Reasons for policy</TE>
<TE>   For about a century, the quarantine has served as a cordon
sanitaire, keeping the nation and its nearly 10 million dogs and cats
virtually rabies-free. The quarantine was tightened after World War
I, when officers brought back infected dogs they'd befriended on the
battlefields of Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "The only defense of this policy is the fact that Britain is an
island," says Seitz, "and this has been a kind of paranoiac
consideration of a lot of island countries." He's from Hawaii, he
says, and understands this. "Once [rabies] is loose in an island
country, you don't get rid of it, it's there forever. But that
argument went away with the [English Channel] tunnel."</TE>
<TE>   In spite of effective vaccines, the quarantine has carried its own
sluggish entropy of resistance. Quarantine kennels lobbied to stay in
business, and no bureaucrat or politician wanted to wear the mantle
of "the man who let rabies into Britain." But like other seemingly
unassailable British customs, such as "last call" in pubs and no
Sunday commerce, the quarantine too began to disappear in an
internationalized world. In February 2000, Britain opened the kennel
doors for cats and dogs from 22 Western European countries, provided
they had the proper paperwork -- "pet passports" proving they had
been microchipped, vaccinated and tested for rabies and treated for
parasites.</TE>
<TE>   It was a concession to Europeanization; if England wasn't adopting
the euro any time soon, at least it could do this for its
Euro-partners. But it was also an acknowledgment that Britain's own
traveling class was no longer confined to diplomats and businessmen.
Ordinary Britons were buying holiday homes on the Continent -- and
they wanted to take their pets with them. And when Europe opened,
could America be far behind?</TE>
<TE>   From Ray Seitz's old digs in the U.S. Embassy, Joyce B. Rabens,
the minister for economic affairs, says diplomatically, "We're very
pleased that DEFRA is giving this a serious look, and we've got our
fingers crossed.... It would mean a tremendous amount of difference
to thousands of families who have had to leave their pets behind."
DEFRA is the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and
it could use some feel-good PR in the wake of the mad-cow and
foot-and-mouth diseases that ravaged British agriculture and its beef
industry.</TE>
<TE>   But it is acting with an abundance of caution. The program might
not take effect until next year, and arriving pets would still have
to meet rigorous standards, including microchipping and rabies
certification from U.S. government-approved veterinarians and a
flight or ocean crossing aboard an approved carrier. That's
easy-peasy compared to the expensive (about $3,000) half-year
quarantine.</TE>
<TE>   Fido's French vacation</TE>
<TE>   The group that has happily made a nuisance of itself lobbying to
end the quarantine was founded by Lady Mary Fretwell, widow of a
British ambassador to France, whose basset hound Bertie died in 1987,
not long out of quarantine. He's become the posthumous poster dog for
the Passport for Pets cause, to stop what Fretwell calls the
"archaic, cruel" practice of quarantine. The smuggling of pets to get
around the quarantine, she contends, is a greater rabies risk than
replacing the quarantine with a regulated inspection "passport"
program. Fretwell's French connection is Patricia Swinglehurst, who
gives Americans the chance to "launder" their pets. For about the
same cost as quarantine, Swinglehurst fosters them with British
families in France for six months, after which time they qualify for
the paperwork requirements to walk into Britain and into their new
homes.</TE>
<TE>   Swinglehurst has placed hundreds of American dogs in France, and
one of her satisfied clients is Jack Bays, a Danville, Calif.,
importer-exporter whose wife was offered a great job with Charles
Schwab here. "Essentially the dogs had a nice six-month vacation in
the south of France," he says, and the couple took long weekend trips
to visit them. Sam and Molly, both Jack Russell terriers, love
London's parks, says Bays -- "all these open spaces where you can
walk. The real problem is getting here and, frankly, if you have pets
you really care about, it actually becomes a very serious
consideration as to whether or not you should take the career move."</TE>
<TE>   As for Swinglehurst, the prospect of the British government's
lifting the quarantine troubles her not at all. "I should be
delighted," she says, "to be put out of business."</TE>

<HD>'Santa' gets a jump on holiday box office</HD>
<DH>The Tim Allen-starring sequel pulls in an estimated $29
million with an early opening.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lorenza Munoz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moviegoers eager for lighthearted family fare delivered Disney and
Tim Allen an early Christmas present with an estimated $29 million
for the opening weekend of "The Santa Clause 2."</LD>
<LD>   The sequel to the hit comedy that launched Allen's movie career
jump-started the holiday season, coming out nearly three weeks before
Thanksgiving and almost two months before Christmas. It also gives
Allen's sagging career a boost, because his recent films "Big
Trouble" and "Joe Somebody" bombed. The picture, which was released
in 3,350 theaters, grossed an estimated $8,662 per location.</LD>
<LD>   Chuck Viane, president of Disney's Buena Vista Pictures
Distribution, said the studio released the film in early November to
avoid overlapping with "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"
which is coming out in two weeks. "The Santa Clause," which came out
in 1994, was released over the Thanksgiving weekend. "The Santa
Clause 2" probably cashed in on parents' desire to see quality family
films, Viane said.</LD>
<TE>   Coming in at No. 2 was DreamWorks' spooky "The Ring," grossing an
estimated $18.5 million, bringing its total to about $64.9 million.
Sony Pictures' TV-to-movie translation "I Spy" debuted at No. 3 with
a disappointing $14 million on 3,182 screens. Even so, the Eddie
Murphy-Owen Wilson vehicle grossed more in its first three days than
the $4.4 million that Murphy's last movie, "The Adventures of Pluto
Nash," has taken in since it opened Oct. 3.</TE>
<TE>   Last weekend's top film, "Jackass: The Movie," dropped 42% to No.
4, taking in an estimated $13.1 million over the weekend and a total
of $42.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros.' "Ghost Ship," continued to fail to scare up much
business, also dropping 42% with an estimated gross of $6.6 million
and a total of $21.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   After 29 weeks in theaters, "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" grossed an
estimated $5.6 million in the No. 6 spot for a total of $185 million.
No. 7's "Sweet Home Alabama" dropped only 28%, romancing an estimated
$4.6 million for a total of $113.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Expanding to 1,252 theaters, Paul Thomas Anderson's "Punch-Drunk
Love" came in at No. 8 with an estimated $4.2 million. The
Sony-Revolution studios film has taken $11.5 million so far, rolling
out slowly from an initial release in three cities. At No. 9 was
Universal's "Red Dragon," which has failed to live up to expectations
raised by its predecessors "Hannibal" and "The Silence of the Lambs."
It grossed an estimated $2.6 million, bringing its total to nearly
$89 million in five weekends.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the top 10 was Fox Searchlight's romantic comedy
"Brown Sugar," which grossed an estimated $1.7 million. The film has
brought in about $25 million so far.</TE>
<TE>   Among films in limited release, Miramax's "Frida" brought in a
little more than $1 million in its second weekend, averaging $21,595
per location in 47 theaters. The Frida Kahlo biopic, directed by
Julie Taymor, has brought in $1.3 million so far. MGM's United
Artists division has delivered an unexpected mini-hit with the
Michael Moore documentary "Bowling for Columbine," which grossed an
estimated $1.65 million or $10,185 per theater in 162 locations. The
movie, which takes sharp aim at America's gun culture, has grossed
$4.6 million so far.</TE>
<TE>   This weekend's box office was up 22% from last weekend but down
from last year's comparable period by 23%, with the current top 10
films grossing an estimated $100 million, compared with $123 million
last year, when "Monsters, Inc." opened with $62.6 million, according
to Nielsen EDI Inc.</TE>

<HD>In hurt and humor, finding ways of living with death</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Prime time once buried the dead swiftly and irrevocably. But look at
this.</LD>
<LD>   Although Andy Brown's wife, Julia, died eight months ago, the ache
of her loss lingers. "I've lost my joy," he says sadly in tonight's
episode of the infant WB series "Everwood."</LD>
<LD>   More than just a poignant moment, Andy's tender expression of
grief reflects gradual evolution in how TV series portray death's
impact on the living. From "Everwood" to NBC's "The West Wing" to
HBO's "Six Feet Under" to Fox's "24" -- which opened its second
season with Teri Bauer's death still weighing heavily on her husband
and daughter a year after her murder -- it's now fine for TV
characters to mourn.</LD>
<TE>   And if not that, keep alive the departed in other ways. Instead of
black armbands, for example, viewers got pitch-black comedy from
HBO's "Curb Your Enthusiasm" recently when Larry David somehow spun
peals of laugh-out-loud humor from the unexpected death of his
fictional mother. In Sunday's episode of Fox's "Futurama," set in the
next century, Al Gore is billed as "inventor of the environment and
first emperor of the moon" at a global warming conference while
resurfacing (in a sort of living death) as a head under glass.</TE>
<TE>   Not that long ago, TV regularly paused for death in newscasts much
longer than in entertainment shows, where characters typically
bypassed pain and went directly to amnesia following the loss of
loved ones and others with whom they were close. Go figure, but all
memory of the dead usually was cranked into the ground with their
bodies, erasing them like blips on a radar screen well before the
final credits.</TE>
<TE>   For contrast, think back to media memorials for Princess Diana and
John F. Kennedy Jr. You know, when anchors, reporters and
commentators draped themselves in black hour after hour, their
grieving faces at half-mast, their hyperbole falling like tears as
Americans who adored watching the rich and haughty fall on their
face-lifts in "Dallas" and "Dynasty" bawled over these real-life
tragedies.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, October was especially morbid, with sniper murders
and Moscow's lethally gassed hostages heading the month's gloomy TV
cortege, along with Democrat Paul Wellstone and others, including his
wife and daughter, dying in a plane crash. Even if Wellstone's death
hadn't ruffled Minnesota's U.S. Senate race shortly before Tuesday's
election, his TV eulogy still would have been substantial.</TE>
<TE>   And rightly so. Yet if this had been a few years ago, and
Wellstone a fictional senator whose plane went down in a prime-time
drama, he would have finished out the hour as faceless and voiceless
as a tree stump. That's because most TV scenarists regarded
depictions of grief as either irrelevant or as melancholic pit stops
that would repel viewers.</TE>
<TE>   An attitude now laid largely to rest.</TE>
<TE>   Take "Six Feet Under," a series at once funereal and funny while
centering on a family-run mortuary. It displays not only cadavers
(which other series also do almost routinely these days), however,
but something much deeper by also keeping alive memories of the
family patriarch who died in the first season's opening episode.</TE>
<TE>   Just as Andy Brown (Treat Williams) clings to visions of his dead
wife in "Everwood," which, in many ways, is about working through
pain. That goal occupies Andy, formerly a famous New York physician,
in this picturesque Colorado town where he moved with his two kids in
hopes of making a new start after Julia's death.</TE>
<TE>   "He's no longer talking to her like she's still here," says his
teenage son, Ephram (Gregory Smith). "So I guess that's a step in the
right direction."</TE>
<TE>   The hour opens and ends in a church, in itself a stunning anomaly
for ever-secular, God-expunged network TV. We find Andy, a Christian
who is anything but devout, especially sad on the 20th anniversary of
his marriage to Julia, and thinking back to when "I knew my life was
worth living."</TE>
<TE>   And now? "I never believed you owed me anything," he tells God,
"but I am telling you I have got nothing left."</TE>
<TE>   What a moving and honest speech this is, one written with great
economy by Oliver Goldstick, directed with no trace of schmaltz by
Michael Schultz and played without false emotion by Williams in a
role that would have lesser actors blubbering and falling back on the
old lip quiver. Especially when Andy delivers a major lump in the
throat upon discovering a surprise that Julia had left behind.</TE>
<TE>   There's no universal scenario for bereavement, making grief a
difficult emotion to depict persuasively. Coming to mind here is the
famous "Chuckles the Clown" episode of "The Mary Tyler Moore Show"
that mingled eulogizing and laughter without dishonoring poor
Chuckles.</TE>
<TE>   It helps tonight that the depth of Andy's despair is something
many real-life mourners can recognize, though, even as "Everwood"
heads toward an ending that's a shade too pat while yielding ever so
slightly to TV's tendency to unnaturally knot loose ends.</TE>
<TE>   Here's hoping that Andy recovers his joy but doesn't entirely lose
his sorrow in the process.</TE>

<HD>'Julius Caesar' focuses on the power of words</HD>
<DH>An Italian company adds layer upon hallucinatory layer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lewis Segal</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Supplying both a lengthy introduction in the UCLA house program and a
little red book of essays, Societas Raffaello Sanzio provided more
program notes than spoken text in its solemn, hallucinatory "Julius
Caesar" at the Freud Playhouse on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Never as lucid as the production itself, the pileup of written
explanations did prove appropriate, for the Italian company's 1997
staging (in Italian with English supertitles) focused on the
manipulation and misuse of rhetoric.</LD>
<LD>   To serve this theme, directors Chiara Guidi, Claudia Castellucci
and Romeo Castellucci pared and pulverized Shakespeare's play, adding
speeches from Cicero and Latin historians.</LD>
<TE>   Very "Fellini Satyricon" in theatrical style, Act 1 focused on the
influence of Cassius (Sergio Scarlatella) on Brutus (Silvano
Voltolina) and, particularly, on the weight of words leading to
assassination. Adding to the weight of those words: casting an
immensely overweight actor (Glauco Natali) as the orator Cicero and
making mighty Caesar (Maurizio Carra) pitifully feeble and powerless.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, all the celebrated speechmaking after Caesar's murder
became transformed in this version by using an actor with a
laryngectomy (Dalmazio Masini) as Antony and having Brutus inhale
helium and thus speak in a comic baby-voice.</TE>
<TE>   Tapes of Marlon Brando's funeral oration from the 1953 film of
"Julius Caesar" added another texture of wordplay.</TE>
<TE>   Very Samuel Beckett in style, Act 2 examined the downfall of
Cassius and Brutus, here recast with two dangerously emaciated women:
Cristiana Bertini and Valentina Picello. Like the Brando tape, the
presence of the Act 1 Cassius and Brutus in secondary roles (Cassius
1 assisting Cassius 2, etc.) helped undermine any conventional
suspension of disbelief and keep the ruinous miscommunications in
these scenes in high relief.</TE>
<TE>   At the end, Cassius beckoned to Brutus from beyond the grave
("It's beautiful here"), and a character identified as ...vskij
(Fabio Sajiz) urged her to take "the line of action." But she
remained paralyzed, unable to either die or go on living in the
war-ravaged world created by her own words.</TE>
<TE>   Superimposed on this action plan or agenda: contrasts between
destructive, word-driven human society and the instinctual animal
kingdom -- a realm represented by a live horse (and later a skeletal
life-size horse puppet), a flying seahorse, a stuffed fox and a
mechanical cat.</TE>
<TE>   In Shakespeare, Antony exclaims "O judgment! Thou art fled to
brutish beasts / And men have lost their reason." Here, however, we
saw the exact opposite: The cat's head spinning dizzily at verbal
overkill and even a chair walking away from Cicero's oration.</TE>
<TE>   Brutish beasts and the material world thus rebelled at what passed
for human judgment or reason. And if each act began with the sight of
a battering ram, it was words that battered at life in this "Julius
Caesar" and left only a bombed-out wasteland as their monument.</TE>
<TE>   Staged with a ravishing sense of design -- from the gauzy,
impressionistic shadow land of Act 1 to the shattered metallic facade
of Act 2 -- the production recognized that stagecraft itself is a
form of rhetoric and continually used the devices of theater to trump
theatrical illusion.</TE>
<TE>   But engraving "This is not an actor" (in French) on a tombstone
that descended on the dead Cassius couldn't nullify Bertini's
performance any more than Guidi and the Castelluccis could nullify
their own superb theatricality by voicing suspicions about theater in
their little red book. Quite apart from its thematic preoccupations,
their "Julius Caesar" made a startling impact from its images, sounds
and unforgettable cast, while all the convoluted program notes
ultimately added up to nothing more than one more example of empty
rhetoric.</TE>

<HD>Where life is served sunny side up</HD>
<DH>Sentimentalism is the special of the day in the superb
'Spitfire Grill.' Revamped from a gritty film, the musical makes its
West Coast debut at Laguna Playhouse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Shirley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three hard-luck women heal their broken spirits after they're thrown
together running a small-town diner. It's a simple premise for an
upbeat script.</LD>
<LD>   But "The Spitfire Grill" was developed in two disparate directions
-- into a rather hysterical melodrama in the 1996 film by Lee David
Zlotoff, and into a more sentimental and sunnier 2000 musical by
composer James Valcq and lyricist Fred Alley, who collaborated on the
book.</LD>
<LD>   The musical is making its first West Coast appearance, at Laguna
Playhouse, in a superb staging by Nick DeGruccio. Despite the
artifice inherent in the musical format -- contrasted with the
grittier surface reality of the movie -- it's the stage version that
emerges as the more coherent and convincing of the two "Spitfire
Grills."</LD>
<TE>   The musical is set in Wisconsin, where lyricist Alley was based,
instead of the movie's Maine. Perhaps Alley didn't want to grapple
with a severe New England accent in the lyrics.</TE>
<TE>   The first part of the musical is very similar to the movie. Still
a young woman, Percy Talbott (Misty Cotton) is released from prison
after serving five years for manslaughter and chooses to live in the
tiny hamlet of Gilead. The only available job and lodging is at the
town's only restaurant, the Spitfire Grill, operated by crusty old
Hannah Ferguson (Jomarie Ward). After an accident temporarily
incapacitates Hannah, Percy is assisted at the diner by Shelby Thorpe
(Kim Huber), the wife of Hannah's bossy nephew (Michael Piontek).</TE>
<TE>   The musical combines two of the movie's characters into Joe Sutter
(Kevin Earley), the town sheriff, who eventually becomes Percy's
suitor.</TE>
<TE>   The postmaster and chief gossip (Linda Kerns) is still on hand, as
is a mysterious hermit (Mark Aaron) who makes nightly stops in back
of the diner for the food that Hannah leaves there for him.</TE>
<TE>   Hannah has tried to sell the diner for a decade, but there are no
takers.</TE>
<TE>   Percy suggests Hannah hold a raffle, in which potential owners
send $100 and an essay explaining why they want the Spitfire; the
best essayist will win the diner at no additional cost, and Hannah
will keep the hundreds of dollars that arrive from throughout
America.</TE>
<TE>   We learn more about the characters' pasts in the second act, and
these details remain largely the same as in the movie. But the
resolution of the story could hardly be more different.</TE>
<TE>   The music also makes a big difference. It's a folk- and
country-influenced score that alternates most of the time between
rousing ensembles and pensive solos -- as well as one especially
rousing solo, "Out of the Frying Pan," which the novice short-order
cook Percy sings while trying to prepare breakfast for the diner's
customers by herself.</TE>
<TE>   The cast couldn't be better. DeGruccio brought along two of his
confederates, Cotton and Earley, from his staging of "Side Show" at
Burbank's Colony Theatre, and they are again stellar, with Cotton
unveiling a young Sissy Spacek look as well as her wide-ranging
pipes. Ward is as rumpled and persuasive as Ellen Burstyn was in the
movie, and Huber enlivens the familiar character of the suppressed
wife who begins to stand up for herself. Tom Griffin's musical
direction makes every note sound clear and true.</TE>
<TE>   The musical makes much of seasonal change, and the visual design
team -- Raymond Kent on the sets, Paulie Jenkins on lights and Dwight
Richard Odle on costumes -- responds well to the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Born at the George Street Playhouse in New Jersey in 2000, the
musical opened in New York last fall in the wake of Sept. 11 -- only
five months after the unexpected death of co-creator Alley. Its sense
of uplift must have seemed perfect for that moment, but even now
there is something irresistible about this show.</TE>

<KH>MUSIC REVIEW</KH>
<HD>A fine Silk Road, but with a few bumps</HD>
<DH>The message of cultural understanding works well, but host
Yo-Yo Ma's overwrought playing raises questions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Swed</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yo-Yo Ma's Silk Road Ensemble, which appeared at Royce Hall Friday
night, included Western strings, brass and percussion, a Mongolian
long song singer, a Chinese pipa player, an Indian tabla player and
three Iranian musicians performing on native instruments. The music
was more East than West, with works by Mongolian, Iranian and Indian
composers, along with traditional Chinese and Iranian music. Debussy,
who cocked his ear in the direction of Asia, stood in for Europe.</LD>
<LD>   The goal of Ma and the many corporate sponsors for this ensemble
is cultural understanding. East and West threaten each other
politically; religions and cultures clash. But put musicians from
just about any place together and it isn't long before they find
common ground. And there is no more vivid example of musician as
nonpolitical middleman than Ma. Besides traveling with colleagues
from at least one country the White House labels evil, he has also
performed with pianist (and National Security Advisor) Condoleezza
Rice.</LD>
<LD>   The UCLA concert was just a taste of the Silk Road road show,
which has alighted in many other towns for extended residencies. But
it was enough to see what a happy band of international troubadours
this 20-member ensemble is.</LD>
<TE>   It was also enough to show how natural it has become to mix and
match instruments from different traditions. To find a tabla or sitar
or African drum in a Western film score or a Western rock band is
hardly news. In classical music, Telemann, Mozart and Beethoven
imitated the sounds of Turkish instruments and probably would have
borrowed from the instruments of other cultures had they encountered
them. No ethnomusicology degree is needed to enjoy the Silk Road
Ensemble.</TE>
<TE>   In the most exciting work on the program, "Blue as the Turquoise
Night of Neyshabur" by Kayhan Kalhor, a snappy Iranian riff repeats
over and over again, always embellished by solo instruments. The
composer, playing a kemancheh (an Iranian spike fiddle) led the way,
and his Iranian colleagues on santur (a plucked zither) and ney
(mellow wood flute) were nearly as lively and inventive, with Ma, the
other string players and tabla player all keeping the energy level
high and the friendly competition interesting.</TE>
<TE>   "Legend of Herlen" by Byambasuren Sharav, a Mongolian composer,
featured long song singer Khongorzul Ganbaatar along with Ma on the
morin khuur, a small fiddle with a horse-head peg. Long songs are
short texts extended through ululating vocalizing. To this Sharav
adds loud, mooring brass and pugnacious percussion to evoke Mongolian
horns and drums. The effect is striking, especially when Ganbaatar's
voice, like a force of nature, cuts through the brass and drums.</TE>
<TE>   A new piece by Sandeep Das, the tabla player, was devised at one
of the group's recent residencies. Here the virtuoso Indian drummer
too easily overshadowed his Western drummers, while the Western
strings never sounded very clever in their approach to a droning
background. The pipa, the Chinese lute, was not integrated into the
program, which was a shame, because Wu Man is a celebrated player
(Lou Harrison wrote a concerto for her three years ago; Terry Riley
is writing a piece for her and the Kronos Quartet). Instead, she
played a traditional solo number; the three Iranians also gave a
traditional demonstration.</TE>
<TE>   Oddly enough, the most jolting performance was of Debussy's Cello
Sonata, for which pianist Joel Fan joined Ma. Perhaps Ma felt a need
to make Debussy an honorary fellow Silk Road traveler, perhaps the
competitive camaraderie had encouraged intemperance, perhaps he just
wanted to jazz it up. But every phrase provided him with a new
opportunity for mugging and musical exaggeration. A consummate
virtuoso, he pulled it off in this context, but not without raising
disturbing questions. The lines between musicality and manipulation
are becoming increasingly blurred in this famous grandstanding
cellist. And one wonders how much his Silk Road project is ultimately
a reflection of the ego of a single restless, jet-setting star.</TE>
<TE>   The grandiosity of the Silk Road project inevitably requires
compromise. An annoying statement in the program, for instance,
demonstrated that Ford Motor Co.'s money is also paying for the
polishing of its historical image with the project.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there is no doubt that these are fine musicians doing music
and society good. And if there were lingering suggestions Friday
night that that was not all there was to it, it is not the first time
business has been done this way on the Silk Road.</TE>

<LD>It's a cloudy Sunday morning, Babbette Hines' happy day.</LD>
<LD>   Large cup of coffee in hand, in flat black shoes, Hines, a
35-year-old photography dealer, isn't looking for anything, really,
at the Long Beach Outdoor Antique &amp; Collectible Market, except the
hint of a promise. Maybe she'll spot the black border of a small
photograph at the bottom of a cigar box or the edge of a strip of
snapshots in a cracked leather suitcase.</LD>
<LD>   Then Hines will drop to her knees on the asphalt, fling off her
glasses and lose herself in an endless search for photo-booth
pictures, or, as she sees them, revealing portraits of the way people
come off -- as class clowns, pensive poets, pretty boys -- when no
one is looking. In her book, "photobooth," which was published last
month by Princeton Architectural Press, Hines presents more than 700
such mini-portraits taken from the 1920s on that she culled mostly
from swap meets and flea markets in Southern California.</LD>
<TE>   Until recently, Hines has had little competition for the strips of
photos. Then, in late 2001, the French film "Amelie" took off; the
movie follows the romance between a dreamy young woman and a recluse
who collects and reassembles torn-up snapshots from train station
photo booths. And, in the last few years, photo-sticker booths have
become popular with preteens and others who take away sheets of the
adhesive-backed snapshots. Also, coming this month, the book "MTV
Photobooth" (Universe) will include snapshot strips of more than 200
celebrities, including a dramatic Madonna and a mugging Ben Affleck,
who ducked into a photo booth that was installed in the cable
network's New York studio.</TE>
<TE>   With the resurging interest in such photos, Hines is competing
with browsers on weekend shopping expeditions who ask dealers in
shorthand: "Do you have photo booth?"</TE>
<TE>   "Fifteen years ago," said Ray Hetrick, who sells at the Long Beach
market and other local venues, "you probably couldn't have sold a
photo-booth picture for a dime." These days, dealers are asking up to
$5 for a single picture.</TE>
<TE>   Hines, who works as a sales assistant at Arcana Books in Santa
Monica, also collects and sells photographs of New York landscapes
and other everyday scenes at a gallery in the Brewery artists complex
in Los Angeles, where she lives with her boyfriend, filmmaker Carlos
Grasso. None of her 2,700 photo-booth pictures are for sale. "They're
my toys," she said, in her sweetly ironic and self-mocking way.</TE>
<TE>   Hines began buying the pictures three years ago, for about 25
cents each, after running across a "funny, little, sweet" photo-booth
picture of her mother as a young girl. The snapshot struck her as the
same type that Hines had taken of herself, and with friends, on
impulse, impatiently waiting for a machine to spit out a strip of
pictures. "I just never imagined her in the same context as me,"
Hines said.</TE>
<TE>   She hopes "photobooth" readers will see the thread between the
22-year-old private from the 1940s, who, according to a scribbled
note on the back of the photograph, was killed in World War II; the
circa-'90s portrait of two grinning young men in backward baseball
caps; and the schoolgirl in a cardigan and Peter Pan collar with a
shy smile and gap between her two front teeth.</TE>
<TE>   Behind a curtain, without a photographer to think about, "You can
be sexy or goofy or tough," Hines writes in the book's introduction.
"In a photo booth, we choose the moment and the way in which we
represent ourselves. We choose our truth."</TE>
<TE>   The book simply presents the pictures, with no explanatory text
other than a preface by acclaimed nonfiction writer Lawrence
Weschler, who describes the "daft, gentle passion" of Hines, and an
essay by Hines, who traces the evolution of the photo booth, which
was developed in 1925 by a Siberian immigrant.</TE>
<TE>   Hines leaves it to readers to fill in the blanks on the stories
behind the photos; the ambiguity only heightens the intrigue. "It's a
book of pictures, but, most importantly, it's a book of stories," she
said. "The picture is always the first line of the story."</TE>
<TE>   One weekend, at the Long Beach flea market, she bought 70
photo-booth pictures -- of the same person. The pictures were taken
in the 1970s or so of a girl, starting at about age 8 through 16.
Such discards of personal history touch Hines in the same way that
something as odd as a three-legged table does. "I'm the taker home of
the sad, unloved object," admits Hines, who claps her hands with
delight when she stumbles on any such ignored offering.</TE>
<TE>   On this morning, Hines spots a nondescript cardboard box on a
nondescript folding table and heads for it. "See, look," she says.
"Photo booth [possibilities] at 100 yards." She lifts a plastic bag
from the box and flops down on a blue tarp, next to a beat-up Raggedy
Ann doll.</TE>
<TE>   In seconds, she picks out a series of photo-booth portraits from,
perhaps, the early 1930s. The pictures show two women who appear to
be in their early 20s and are wearing knit bonnets. One woman is
pretty and flashes an easy grin; the other has a round, serious face.</TE>
<TE>   "She was way more chipper," began Hines, pointing out the smiling
woman and letting her imagination run with a narrative. "She was the
dowdy one, waiting for the boys to notice her...."</TE>

<HD>Experimental art takes to the streets</HD>
<DH>LA Freewaves' 'TV or Not TV' gives a public forum to
Web-based works, performance and video offerings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Timberg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Six women police officers -- at least they looked like police
officers, except for the bad wigs and a pair of leather pants --
formed a phalanx in Chinatown's Central Plaza, pointing bullhorns and
nightsticks. Gray balloons tricked up to look like a police
helicopter hovered above them.</LD>
<LD>   "I'd like to see some I.D. please," one of them demanded of an
unassuming man in a heavy coat, crowding him with enormous
flashlights while another pointed a video camera.</LD>
<LD>   Turns out it was all in the service of art. The group was part of
a sprawling evening devoted to the opening Friday night of "TV or Not
TV," the eighth biannual "celebration of experimental media arts"
organized by LA Freewaves.</LD>
<TE>   Introducing herself as an officer of the LATT -- the full name of
which involves slang words for female body parts -- Heather Cassils
shot out curt sentences as she discussed her collaborative group.
"Tonight we're an alternative police force. We're the Big Sister
that's watching Big Brother. We'll be stopping people and
interrogating them. We'll be stopping people and asking them on
dates."</TE>
<TE>   Were they an art collective? "That's confidential!" Cassils
barked.</TE>
<TE>   With about 60 artists represented, the festival opening took over
a stretch of the city roughly bordered by Broadway and Chung King
Road, near Bernard Street, an area that has recently become rich turf
for galleries. Projections lit up the sides of buildings; TV sets
played tape loops in cafes, in galleries; performances used the
sidewalks for stages.</TE>
<TE>   On one TV set, a surly Charlton Heston, armed and dangerous,
ripped through the city in a car while electronic music played and a
voice intoned "The entire Los Angeles area" and "All civilian traffic
is barred from streets and highways." On another, a Central European
animated short followed a family of intelligent potatoes. At the New
China Town Barber Shop, six works spooled out under the heading
"Involuntary Narratives," and outside the Acuna-Hansen Gallery, a
performance called "Plasticos: Non-Surgical Plastic Surgery Clinic"
unfolded.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the works, like one that told the empowering tale of a
female hard-rock band or the verite chronicle of the life of a young
Asian woman, were concerned with gender issues and ethnic
representation. Most were fairly cryptic; a few were too lengthy to
command attention in the street-party atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in Central Plaza, Anne Bray, LA Freewaves' executive
director, took a look at the action and pronounced herself pleased.</TE>
<TE>   "We took the theme of 'the wounded city and the worried suburbs'
and put it in the middle of the city," she said. "We turned the
square into a living room and put a TV in the middle."</TE>
<TE>   Happy to see a blend of generations and ethnic groups on the
plaza, she dubbed the crowd of a few hundred "not just the isolated
art world -- it's a regular urban audience. There's all this cultural
mixing in the work, and I see it in the crowd too."</TE>
<TE>   Making distinctions among Web-based artworks, performance art and
video didn't seem to interest her much: "I just like experimental
thought; I don't care what medium it's in."</TE>
<TE>   That sort of eclecticism will mark the rest of the festival as
well; it continues through Nov. 30 and features videos,
installations, discussions and other programming at some 40 venues --
from the Iturralde Gallery to the Armory Center for the Arts in
Pasadena to three video billboards. According to Bray, more than
1,000 submissions of media art from all over the world were culled to
come up with works by 350 artists for this year's festival.</TE>
<TE>   As Friday night wore on, a few favorites emerged among the
Chinatown attendees. One was at the Happy Lion Gallery: a thin man,
shot in black and white, standing before a mirror, smoking, shaving,
putting on flesh-toned makeup as if preparing for a performance. But
this was the performance.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an hour and 57 minutes long," explained the artist, Skip
Arnold, standing outside the gallery in a battered leather jacket and
trademark scarf. His piece was made with security cameras at L.A.'s
Palace Theatre this year: The cameras showed an assembled audience a
closed-circuit image of him getting ready in the dressing room.</TE>
<TE>   "No one saw me arrive onstage, but they had the anticipation of me
arriving," said Arnold, who teaches at CalArts and lists Charlie
Chaplin and the last scene in "Raging Bull" as his inspirations. "I
never come onto -- quote, unquote -- the stage," he said. At the
show's end, the audience sees him, on camera, walk out of the
theater, mission accomplished.</TE>
<TE>   A piece with an entirely different tone, one of many that came
into the festival about last year's terrorist attacks, showed the
last hour of daylight in New York on Sept. 11. Filmed from the roof
of William Basinski's Brooklyn apartment, with a soundtrack made from
what was called a CD-burning accident,  "Disintegration" was screened
in a parking lot off Hill Street.</TE>
<TE>   Past a couple of dumpsters and surrounded by fire escapes and the
back of the Full House Restaurant, stairs lead down to a noisy, dark
basement space run by a collective of CalArts graduates who call
themselves c-level.</TE>
<TE>   "L.A. has a real dearth of spaces for video and electronic work,"
says co-founder Eddo Stern, who collects images of Osama bin Laden
from the Internet. "We can't wait around for the museums; they're 10
years behind." Added Jeff Hermann: "Without this festival, there's no
public forum for this kind of thing. It doesn't get off the
Internet."</TE>
<TE>   By late evening, LA Freewaves had filled the Central Plaza's
stairways, alleys and sidewalks with mostly young people dressed in
black, smoking.</TE>
<TE>   "I've decided that this is the coherent side, and that's the
incoherent side," said Karen Schenkmeyer, a Silver Lake photographer,
standing in the middle of the plaza. "I like this side," she said,
gesturing toward the screens and projections near Hill Street. "I'm a
narrative person."</TE>

<HD>5 Travel Agencies Suing Major Airlines, Orbitz</HD>
<DH>The California firms seek class-action status for claim
that Web site owned by the five biggest U.S. carriers is
anti-competitive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bonnie Harris</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five California-based travel agencies are suing major U.S. airlines
and online travel site Orbitz Inc. for anti-competitive practices and
have asked a federal judge to certify their lawsuit as a class
action.</LD>
<LD>   Their antitrust suit claims travel agents are going out of
business "by the carloads" because airlines have cut commissions and
steered consumers to Web-only fares that are sold on the airlines'
own Internet sites. The plaintiffs filed the suit this year in U.S.
District Court in Los Angeles, and last week sought class-action
status.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit asks that travel agents be compensated for the
commissions they would have been paid for selling tickets over the
last four years if airlines hadn't kept shaving their fees, all the
while pushing travelers to book via the Internet.</LD>
<TE>   No damages were specified. Plaintiffs' attorney Max Blecher said
that if more agencies were to join the suit, their claims for back
commissions could be "well in the billions" of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   This year, airlines stopped paying commissions to agents booking
domestic flights, drastically thinning the ranks of the nation's
traditional travel agents and forcing surviving agencies to charge
fees to customers for such routine services as making reservations.</TE>
<TE>   "They have to do something, because they need relief," said Tom
Parsons, who runs Bestfares.com, a travel Web site. "They're
basically saying, 'Let us have fair access.' To them, the airlines
are going to make them extinct."</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit also seeks to dissolve Orbitz. The online site is
owned by the five biggest carriers: AMR Corp.'s American Airlines,
UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines and
Continental Airlines, though only American, United and Delta are
named in the suit.</TE>
<TE>   The carriers maintain that they formed the site to guard against
the rising dominance of Expedia Inc. and Travelocity.com -- the two
biggest online travel agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Orbitz's online rivals as well as traditional travel agents claim
Orbitz's arrangement with the carriers gives it exclusive access to
its owners' lowest rates, severely curbing competition. Orbitz says
it saves airlines about 30% on each transaction compared with other
travel agents or Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   "Orbitz is destined to become a monopoly," Blecher said. "Its
arrangement to offer deeply discounted seats from the largest
airlines, seats that aren't available to other travel agencies,
amounts to nothing short of collusion."</TE>
<TE>   The complaint is not the first to be filed against Orbitz. In
September, the Transportation Department dismissed complaints by the
American Society of Travel Agents that Orbitz had waged an
anti-competitive campaign against travel agencies.</TE>
<TE>   The Transportation Department said it would not investigate
further complaints by the 26,000-member trade group. Orbitz remains
under investigation by antitrust regulators at the Justice
Department, however.</TE>
<TE>   Citing the Transportation Department's ruling, Orbitz asked U.S.
District Judge Edward Rafeedie in Los Angeles to dismiss the
California case. Orbitz officials said "times have changed" in the
travel-booking market and accused the plaintiffs of being unable to
accept new technology and learn to compete with lower-cost ticket
distributors.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Orbitz said it sold less than 4% of all online
airline tickets last year and therefore is nowhere near to becoming a
monopoly. Analysts said Orbitz has a 20% market share and is only 3
or 4 percentage points behind Travelocity and Expedia.</TE>
<TE>   "Theirs is really a nothing lawsuit," said Orbitz spokeswoman
Stacey Spencer. "They are trying to drum up publicity for a case
that's similar to what's already been dismissed by the DOT. It's old
news."</TE>
<TE>   But Rafeedie rejected Orbitz's motion to dismiss the case and will
rule on the certification for class action in January. The five
plaintiffs are Travel Galore in Encino, Albany Travel in Albany,
International Travel Bureau Inc. in San Francisco and JAS Travel Inc.
and Miyamoto Travel Service, both in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, a class suit was filed by travel agents alleging that the
airlines violated antitrust laws by conspiring to lower commissions
and cap how much they would pay agents. Several big carriers, which
denied any wrongdoing, paid a combined $87 million to settle the
claims.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea is, if you have to keep paying commissions in the form
of damages, you might as well keep paying them upfront in the first
place," Blecher said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, some analysts said consumers probably don't realize
they are potential losers if the system doesn't change, because
Orbitz's arrangement with the five largest U.S. airlines gives the
airline industry near total control over pricing.</TE>
<TE>   "Orbitz is looking like a global distribution system, a travel
agency and an airline all at the same time," said Bob Jones, an
analyst with the online site OneTravel.com. "It's in the perfect
position to quickly go from a benevolent oligopoly to a brutal
monopoly."</TE>

<HD>Asian, S. Pacific Airlines Add Flights at LAX</HD>
<DH>The carriers, struggling from global air-travel slump, say
some of the increase is seasonal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James F. Peltz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A few Asian and South Pacific airlines are choosing to spread their
wings in Los Angeles as they cautiously expand service in the face of
the global travel slump.</LD>
<LD>   Air New Zealand and China Southern Airlines are among those that
have added flights from Los Angeles International Airport in recent
weeks. Singapore Airlines has announced plans to expand its Los
Angeles-Singapore service next year with what it says will be the
world's longest nonstop flight, 18 hours, between the two markets.
(Its flights currently make a stop in Japan or Taiwan.) Qantas
Airways is considering adding a third daily flight from LAX to Sydney
next year.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles area scored another victory recently when Japan
Airlines decided to consolidate its North American headquarters in El
Segundo early next year. JAL will merge its administrative, marketing
and operations staffs in New York and San Francisco with its existing
sales and reservations office in El Segundo, which will have a total
of about 200 employees, said spokeswoman Carol Anderson.</LD>
<TE>   Air New Zealand is expanding to 14 flights a week -- or two a day
-- from 10 between Los Angeles and Auckland, the first time in the
airline's 60-year history that it has offered such frequent service
between those markets, said spokeswoman Lucy Powell. The carrier also
is increasing service between LAX and Sydney to five flights a week
from three.</TE>
<TE>   China Southern, meanwhile, on Saturday began offering a fifth
weekly flight between LAX and Guangzhou, China.</TE>
<TE>   Asian and South Pacific airlines, which board more than 2 million
passengers a year at LAX, said some of the added flights reflect
seasonal increases in the airlines' capacity. For example, for the
next few months it is summer in Australia and New Zealand, and a
popular time for tourists.</TE>
<TE>   The carriers said they also are adding seats because of slightly
stronger demand for service generally across the Pacific, which
plunged in the months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. But they
cautioned that the market is still very sluggish, and carriers such
as Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways are sticking with their
current schedules.</TE>
<TE>   "In broad terms we've more than recovered from post-9/11 levels in
terms of economy class traffic," said James Boyd, a spokesman for
Singapore Airlines. But demand for first- and business-class tickets
still has not fully rebounded, he added.</TE>
<TE>   The airline said last week that recovery in air travel "suffered a
setback" from the recent terrorist bombing in Bali, and "the
short-term outlook for the airline and tourism business is clouded by
this and the threat of war in the Middle East."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. carriers with service to Asia also face a struggle. Northwest
Airlines, which has a hub in Tokyo and was once known as Northwest
Orient, has slashed its Pacific capacity by 12% from a year ago, and
the region's passenger traffic in the nine months ended Sept. 30 was
down 9%.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese travel to the United States has been especially slow to
rebound since the attacks, said Northwest, which has one flight a day
between LAX and Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   "The volume of Japan is not growing as fast as the volume
everywhere else," Philip Haan, Northwest's executive vice president
for international service, told analysts last month.</TE>

<HD>Unusual Public Spat Between Amgen, J&amp;J</HD>
<DH>Firms' tussle over anti-anemia drug market roils a meeting
of kidney specialists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Denise Gellene</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>The long-simmering feud between Amgen Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson over
the world's bestselling biotechnology drug spilled into an annual
meeting of kidney specialists here over the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, said the American Society of
Nephrologists allowed J&amp;J to stack a scientific panel discussion on a
mysterious illness linked to Eprex, the anti-anemia drug taken by
dialysis patients that J&amp;J sells in Europe under a license from
Amgen. Amgen complained that the panel gave J&amp;J a platform to spread
doubt about anemia treatments Amgen sells.</LD>
<LD>   It was the first session for kidney specialists on pure red cell
aplasia since May, when the Food and Drug Administration tied 78
cases of the serious immune disorder to Eprex. The number of cases
has risen to 160 through July.</LD>
<TE>   The unusual public spat over the panel highlights the role of
medical meetings in marketing drugs. Amgen and Johnson &amp; Johnson have
long bickered over the $7-billion annual anti-anemia business they
share under a 17-year-old contract. The drug brings in billions of
dollars in sales for each company.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen has been a ubiquitous presence at the yearly meeting of
kidney specialists, and company logos adorned the weekend's meeting
programs, hotel shuttle buses and room key cards at two dozen hotels
near the Philadelphia Convention Center.</TE>
<TE>   But Amgen did not get a seat on the Saturday panel. Three of the
five panelists were J&amp;J specialists. Amgen was given two minutes to
make a statement at the end of the 90-minute discussion, which was
attended by a standing-room-only crowd of 1,500 kidney specialists.</TE>
<TE>   J&amp;J proposed and sponsored the session, which shed little new
light on a vexing health problem that is threatening Eprex. The pace
of Eprex sales slipped in the third quarter, as European physicians
switched dialysis patients to alternative treatments.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Narins of the American Society of Nephrology said he
accepted J&amp;J's offer to underwrite the panel because pure red cell
aplasia was a "hot topic that had slipped through the cracks" in
meeting planning.</TE>
<TE>   J&amp;J scientists sat on the panel out "of necessity," he said,
because the company had patient data. Rounding out the panel were two
European experts invited by the nephrologists.</TE>
<TE>   Narins said he did not allow Amgen to sit on the panel because he
did not want the session to become a commercial for any product.
Amgen sells a second-generation anemia treatment not covered by the
1985 licensing pact with J&amp;J. Narins said Roche Group of Switzerland
makes a competing anti-anemia drug and was not permitted to sit on
the panel either.</TE>
<TE>   "We put this on because it is a medical issue," Narins said. "But
we are not so naive to not understand that there is a cat fight going
on."</TE>
<TE>   The two companies' tussle for dominance in the anti-anemia
marketplace has taken legal turns as well. Two weeks ago, a federal
arbitrator ordered J&amp;J to pay $150 million for poaching in Amgen's
market but refused to dissolve the agreement, as Amgen requested.</TE>
<TE>   Eprex is J&amp;J's brand of EPO, a genetically engineered copy of the
protein that spurs red blood cell production.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen, the inventor of EPO, sells the drug in the United States to
kidney dialysis patients. J&amp;J sells EPO in other U.S. markets and in
Europe under a license from Amgen. Amgen developed its
second-generation product, Aranesp, to reclaim sales from J&amp;J.</TE>
<TE>   The economic stakes are huge. Together, Amgen and J&amp;J will take in
nearly $7 billion this year from EPO sales. But Amgen estimates that
business will grow to $10 billion by 2005 as more kidney disease and
cancer patients take the medications.</TE>
<TE>   Before the panel discussion got underway Saturday, moderator
Eberhard Ritz, an academic from Germany, said he would not permit an
"ugly Salem witch trial atmosphere." His warning didn't prevent
participants from landing a few punches during the discussion.</TE>
<TE>   In a pointed exchange that drew a loud murmur from the audience, a
kidney specialist asked J&amp;J drug safety director John Knight which
drug he personally would use of the three main anti-anemia drugs.
Knight hedged, saying he would find a good physician and leave the
decision to him.</TE>
<TE>   Pure red cell aplasia is a potentially life-threatening disorder
in which patients develop antibodies that attack a protein needed for
red blood cell production. Severe anemia results.</TE>
<TE>   The disorder began surfacing in Eprex patients in 1998, around the
time J&amp;J changed the formulation of the drug. J&amp;J substituted a
chemical stabilizer for albumin, a serum derived from human blood.
European authorities told J&amp;J to replace the albumin to remove any
risk of the human form of "mad-cow" disease.</TE>
<TE>   EPO sold in the United States is manufactured by Amgen and
contains albumin.</TE>
<TE>   J&amp;J's Knight told kidney specialists Saturday that a change in how
patients use the drug may also have played a role in the spate of
illnesses. Beginning in 1997, he said, patients increasingly began
self-injecting Eprex. Before that, more patients received the drug
intravenously from a doctor.</TE>
<TE>   Patients might not have been refrigerating the drug, as directed,
said J&amp;J Vice President Basant Sharma. The drug degrades at room
temperature, he said. European authorities now recommend intravenous
use of Eprex, he added.</TE>
<TE>   J&amp;J's scientists said a series of product tests and an
investigation of its Eprex factory in Puerto Rico uncovered no
product defects.</TE>
<TE>   J&amp;J did not focus entirely on Eprex. During her presentation, J&amp;J
scientist Linda Joliffe took a shot at Amgen with data showing that
mice developed antibodies when given an Aranesp-like drug. No cases
of pure red cell aplasia have been linked to Amgen's
second-generation medicine.</TE>
<TE>   After the session, Tony Gringeri, Amgen product development vice
president, called the experiment "bad science" and questioned why J&amp;J
didn't test Aranesp, which is readily available from drug
wholesalers.</TE>
<TE>   "I am going to call that what it probably was -- a commercial,"
Gringeri said.</TE>
<TE>   Panelist Huub Schellekens, an immunologist from the Netherlands,
said in an interview that the mouse experiment left him unconvinced.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes no sense," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Retired UCLA medical professor Richard Glassock said there was no
reason to believe other products had the problems of Eprex. Glassock
served as moderator with Ritz.</TE>
<TE>   Though frozen out of Saturday's symposium, Amgen has played a
crucial behind-the-scenes role in bringing pure red cell aplasia
cases to light. When French scientist Nicole Casadevall reported
three cases of the illness in 1999, Amgen contacted her to learn
more. The firm provided her with grant money for a lab technician and
developed three tests to detect the illness in Casadevall's patients.</TE>
<TE>   Gringeri said Amgen shared results of Casadevall's work with the
FDA and J&amp;J. Her study appeared in the Feb. 14 issue of the New
England Journal of Medicine and cast a harsh light on Eprex. The FDA
released its tally of cases in response to her report.</TE>
<TE>   Gringeri said that Amgen's efforts were not directed at J&amp;J. Amgen
offered at least twice to collaborate with its estranged business
partner, to no avail, he said. Scientists from the companies met in
Thousand Oaks last year but could not agree on how to share the data.</TE>
<TE>   J&amp;J insisted on complete control and Amgen refused, said Amgen
spokesman Jeff Richardson.</TE>
<TE>   Discussions "got bogged down with the lawyers a little bit," said
J&amp;J spokesman Doug Abersfeld.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Harlan Weisman, president of research and development
for J&amp;J, called on his competitors to collaborate. He wants the
companies to develop worldwide registries for pure red cell aplasia
and establish a standard test for the condition, among other things.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not comfortable enough is being done by us or any of the
manufacturers," he said.</TE>

<HD>NBC, Bravo May Be Near Deal</HD>
<DH>The network and cable channel were hours away from a pact,
sources say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sallie Hofmeister</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NBC is close to a deal to buy the Bravo cable channel from
Cablevision Systems Corp. for $1.25 billion in cash and stock,
according to people close to the negotiations. The two parties were
hours away from signing a deal late Sunday night after weeks of
talks, the sources said.</LD>
<LD>   The transaction, which sources cautioned could unravel, would give
NBC, which is owned by General Electric Co., its first general
entertainment cable channel and an outlet for televising shows that
appear on its broadcast network.</LD>
<LD>   NBC's rival broadcasters already own such cable channels, allowing
them to spread the high costs of prime-time television production
across several outlets.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, Walt Disney Co. bought what is now known as the ABC
Family Channel from News Corp. for more than $5.2 billion and is
repeating shows from the ABC broadcast network on the new channel.
Fox owns FX, while CBS parent Viacom Inc. owns TNT, which has
increased its ratings this year as a result of airing the CBS hit,
"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation."</TE>
<TE>   For Cablevision, the deal would unwind a long-standing partnership
with NBC and would help the Bethpage, N.Y.-based cable company, the
nation's seventh-largest, close a $500-million funding gap in its
business plan.</TE>
<TE>   NBC owns about 25% of Rainbow Media Holdings, the programming arm
of Cablevision that includes nationally distributed cable channels
Bravo, American Movie Classics, the Independent Film Channel and WE:
Women's Entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   The partnership between NBC and Cablevision soured last summer
amid a shareholder revolt against the cable company. Investors,
including NBC, were irate after Cablevision agreed to buy back
control of Rainbow Media Holdings for $8 a share just months after
spinning off the cable programming arm to the public at about $30 a
share.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts speculated that Cablevision was positioning itself to
sell some of the Rainbow assets to raise cash.</TE>
<TE>   Cablevision was one of the hardest-hit cable stocks this year,
pummeled by the general market downturn as well as the bankruptcy
filing of rival Adelphia Communications Corp., the nation's
sixth-largest cable provider.</TE>
<TE>   Under the deal with NBC, Cablevision would receive about $1
billion in GE stock for its 80% of Bravo. In exchange, NBC would give
up its stake in Rainbow. On Friday, Cablevision shares closed up 53
cents at $10.09 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has lost
about 70% in the last year. GE shares closed at $26 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., which bought a 20% stake in
Cablevision's four national cable networks nearly two years ago for
$825 million, would receive $250 million in cash from NBC for its
Bravo interests.</TE>
<TE>   Cablevision founder Charles Dolan sold MGM the stake after an
auction of the four channels failed to garner his $4-billion asking
price. NBC was among the bidders, offering about $3.9 billion for the
four channels.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say that NBC is paying a premium for Bravo, although the
multiple is not as high as that paid by Disney for the Family
Channel. In a recent report, Merrill Lynch valued Bravo at more than
$750 million.</TE>
<TE>   Sources say Cablevision also has received bids in the last month
for its American Movie Classics network. Both Viacom and MGM made
offers, these sources say, but they fall short of Dolan's $3-billion
asking price.</TE>
<TE>   For NBC, Bravo is its third major cable network. The company
already owns business news network CNBC and the MSNBC news joint
venture with Microsoft Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Bravo is NBC's second major acquisition. The company bought
Spanish-language broadcaster Telemundo last year.</TE>

<HD>Online Music Sales Dive From 2001</HD>
<DH>Figures appear to support record labels' contention that
free swapping networks such as Kazaa and Morpheus are undercutting
sellers.</DH>

<LD>Online sales of recorded music have plummeted 25% through the third
quarter compared with the same period last year, dropping even faster
than the overall U.S. music market, according to a survey to be
released today.</LD>
<LD>   The survey appears to support the contention by record labels that
free, online music-swapping networks such as Kazaa and Morpheus are
undercutting music sales.</LD>
<LD>   In the first half of the year, online sales of music fell to $424
million, a drop of 20% from the same period last year, according to
data collected by ComScore Networks, which electronically monitors
consumer habits.</LD>
<TE>   Total U.S. shipments of music dropped 7%, to $5.53 billion, during
the first half of the year, according to the Recording Industry Assn.
of America.</TE>
<TE>   The decline of music sales online, however, has accelerated all
year.</TE>
<TE>   "While a host of factors inevitably impact any consumer behavior,
it is likely that file sharing and CD burning are having a more
noticeable impact on online sales," ComScore said in its report.</TE>
<TE>   The survey, which ComScore said is based on its monitoring of 1.5
million Internet users, does not include purchases of some streaming
online music or sales from auction Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts say the sharp sales decline -- coupled with a steady
rise in users of Kazaa and similar networks -- also clouds the
prospects for the major record labels to launch their own fee-based
online music services.</TE>
<TE>   And the survey appears to support the position of the RIAA, which
is engaged in an elaborate campaign to dismantle free file-swapping
services and frustrate music pirates.</TE>
<TE>   "All legitimate businesses online have an incentive to fight
piracy," said RIAA spokesman Jonathan Lamy. "Obviously, as this study
shows, it affects everyone."</TE>

<HD>Many Consumers Discount Ruling</HD>
<DH>The antitrust battle has failed to resonate for computer
users as they have seen innovation, competition thriving in the
industry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. Huffstutter and David Colker</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was in the name of consumers such as Karlie Johanson that the
federal government and a phalanx of state attorneys general spent
four years battling Microsoft Corp. in a landmark antitrust lawsuit.</LD>
<LD>   But as Johanson wandered the crowded aisles of Fry's Electronics
in Woodland Hills, the 24-year-old student teacher echoed the
sentiments of countless other computer users by discounting the
effects of a settlement approved Friday by a U.S. District Court
judge.</LD>
<LD>   "The whole thing seems like such a joke, a waste of time and our
tax dollars," she said, picking up a copy of Microsoft's Encarta, the
only encyclopedia program stocked at the store.</LD>
<TE>   Shrugging her shoulders, she dropped the box into her cart.</TE>
<TE>   "Microsoft's everywhere, aren't they?" she asked. "Why even bother
trying to fight it?"</TE>
<TE>   Johanson's resignation is hardly surprising, given the
complexities of a case that employed hundreds of lawyers, cost
millions of dollars and dwelt on the technical arcana of Microsoft's
flagship Windows operating system.</TE>
<TE>   Despite warnings from the government and Microsoft's rivals that
the Redmond, Wash., software giant was using its monopoly power to
stifle innovation and competition, the legal struggle has failed to
resonate for most consumers.</TE>
<TE>   And the reason is simple: All they have seen in the years since
Microsoft was taken to court is better gadgetry at lower prices.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like the health-care industry, where their insurance
premiums and prescription costs are always going up," said Stan
Liebowitz, professor of managerial economics at the University of
Texas at Dallas, and co-author of "Winners, Losers &amp; Microsoft."</TE>
<TE>   "This is an industry," he added, "where everything's been getting
cheaper, where the products are getting more powerful, and the leader
of it all is supposed to be a big, bad monopoly doing big, bad
things."</TE>
<TE>   For example, it was the aggressive way Microsoft took over the
Internet browser market from Netscape Communications in the mid-1990s
that brought the software maker's business tactics to wide public
attention and helped prompt the initial lawsuit in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Internet browsers can do more than ever and are still largely
free.</TE>
<TE>   Many consumer advocates still fear that Microsoft will use its
overwhelming market power -- Windows powers more than 90% of all
personal computers -- to dominate home entertainment, mobile
computing and business technology.</TE>
<TE>   Other experts believe that Microsoft faces more competition than
ever in these areas. None of this was addressed directly in Friday's
ruling by U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly.</TE>
<TE>   During the court fight, all sides portrayed themselves as the
consumer's proxy.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department and the state attorneys general said they
sued Microsoft to protect technological innovation and keep prices
low.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft said it could not be constrained by antiquated laws if
it hoped to satisfy needs not yet even imagined by the average
computer user.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement -- hammered out last year between Microsoft, the
Justice Department and nine states -- attempts to balance those goals
by requiring Microsoft to share more technical information with other
software makers and by allowing customers to disable some Microsoft
programs within Windows.</TE>
<TE>   Still, most consumers have no idea what the settlement really
means for them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like asking someone at the turn of the 19th century, who
only rides a horse, what he thinks the impact of the automobile will
have on his life," said Jonathan Gaw, an e-commerce and Internet
analyst with the research firm IDC.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's ruling was widely interpreted as a victory for Microsoft.
Kollar-Kotelly rejected many of the harsher remedies proposed by a
group of state attorneys general who had balked at the negotiated
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   That's a sobering thought, even for Microsoft fans such as Neal
Lavine of Burbank, who works for a company that tests new television
shows before live audiences.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft's products "are excellent, but I just wish there was
more competition out there," said Lavine, 44, while shopping at an
Apple Store in the Glendale Galleria. "If there is no competition,
the prices stay high."</TE>
<TE>   In her ruling, the judge acknowledged that Microsoft had often
taken a "paternalistic view" toward consumers, but she agreed with
the software firm that most of the states' proposals went beyond the
company's misdeeds and would mostly benefit its competitors.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of consumer-plaintiff lawsuits could still address subjects
left out of Kollar-Kotelly's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "Microsoft is not out of the woods by any means," said Richard
Grossman, a San Francisco-based attorney who is lead counsel for a
consolidated consumer-plaintiff case set for trial Feb. 3.</TE>
<TE>   At the Gateway Country store in Glendale, few people, if any,
seemed to care about the ruling's details. Some had already relegated
the Microsoft case to yesterday's headlines.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Warren was standing outside the store, struggling to carry
a bulky computer, when told that the judge's decision looked to favor
Microsoft.</TE>
<TE>   "I use their products and they are very good," said Warren, who
lives in Palmdale. "That's just fine with me that they won."</TE>

<HD>DirecTV, NFL Scrimmage Over Games Package Fee</HD>
<DH>With the two sides far apart in negotiations, the league is
shopping the lineup to cable operators</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sallie Hofmeister</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's third down and long yardage for DirecTV.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's leading satellite TV service is trying to close a
deal with the National Football League for a premium package of
games, but the two sides are hundreds of millions of dollars apart.
DirecTV is owned by El Segundo-based Hughes Electronics Corp.</LD>
<LD>   According to sources close to the negotiations, DirecTV has
offered to pay about $200 million annually for the next five years to
keep exclusive rights to "NFL Sunday Ticket," a lineup of games that
helped launch the satellite service.</LD>
<TE>   Although that offer is 30% higher than DirecTV's current contract,
which expires at the end of the season, it's not close to what league
officials are asking. They're seeking $400 million to $500 million a
year, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   To drive up the price, the NFL is pitting satellite operators
against cable providers, which covet the package of Sunday afternoon
games. Cable industry executives say the league is considering
several expansion opportunities to include them, such as offering new
packages that would allow subscribers to watch games of only their
favorite teams or of one conference or the other.</TE>
<TE>   The television industry is closely watching the negotiations
because of concerns about a steep rise in sports rights fees over the
last decade.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL has been more successful than any other sports league in
extracting big increases for its rights, doubling cable and broadcast
rates under an eight-year, $18.3-billion contract struck in 1998 with
CBS, ABC, ESPN and Fox.</TE>
<TE>   Yet many experts say sports rights have peaked, pointing to the
contract the National Basketball Assn. struck this year with the
networks at about the same rate as its previous deal. They say a
$1-billion write-off on sports contracts taken this year by Fox is
another sign that network buyers can no longer afford rate increases.</TE>
<TE>   DirecTV would not comment on the discussions, which have been
underway since spring. But NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said Friday
that no deal with DirecTV is imminent.</TE>
<TE>   "We are still talking to satellite companies," McCarthy said,
indicating that the league also is holding discussions with DirecTV
rival EchoStar Communications Corp. "Cable is still in the mix" as
well, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 1.5 million of DirecTV's 10.5 million subscribers pay $179
a year to receive "NFL Sunday Ticket." That entitles them to as many
as 13 games on any given Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Football fans who do not subscribe can watch only the games being
televised locally by Fox and CBS.</TE>
<TE>   Both Fox and CBS are compensated by the NFL for sharing their
Sunday games with DirecTV.</TE>
<TE>   Although DirecTV is losing money on the football package, the
company has been willing to pay a premium to keep the package out of
the reach of its cable rivals.</TE>
<TE>   DirecTV has carried the games since its 1994 debut as a way to
lure subscribers from cable and appeal to sports fanatics willing to
pay extra to watch their teams.</TE>
<TE>   Cable operators such as AOL Time Warner Inc. have met with NFL
officials in recent weeks, eager to offer these so-called
out-of-market football games to their own subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   But cable's chances of prevailing in any bidding war are slim. Fox
and CBS have long worried that making games available on cable would
siphon viewers from their broadcasts. DirecTV doesn't pose as big a
threat because the satellite broadcaster reaches only about 10% of
American homes, compared with the 70% that subscribe to cable.</TE>
<TE>   The cable industry's odds of winning the package are even narrower
because of the role in the negotiations played by News Corp., owner
of the Fox broadcast network. Under the eight-year television
contract struck in 1998, Fox and CBS were granted the right to block
any sale of "NFL Sunday Ticket" to any outlet other than DirecTV
because of the potential risk to their ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, federal regulators blocked the proposed $18-billion
merger of the nation's two satellite TV providers, EchoStar and
DirecTV. That gives News Corp. another opportunity to purchase
DirecTV after an ill-fated attempt last fall.</TE>
<TE>   Television executives say News Corp. is not going to approve any
NFL deal with cable or with EchoStar now that it has another chance
to buy DirecTV and keep the exclusive advantage for itself.</TE>
<TE>   Although DirecTV may not have won federal approval for its merger,
it may in the end have the upper hand in its dealings with the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   Said one source, "DirecTV is putting pressure on the NFL, saying
take it or leave it, because once News Corp. enters the picture to
buy DirecTV, the NFL loses its leverage."</TE>

<HD>Firms to Disclose More to the State Under New Law</HD>
<DH>Public companies must provide key facts about executives,
directors, auditors. Some say the statute creates a burden.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathy M. Kristof</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new California law will require public companies to make a host of
disclosures to the state starting next year -- disclosures that the
law's sponsors say will help combat corporate fraud and protect
investors.</LD>
<LD>   But some critics see the law as creating a new paperwork burden
for businesses while duplicating information that public firms
already file with the federal government.</LD>
<LD>   The California Corporate Disclosure Act, signed by Gov. Gray Davis
in late September, will require every publicly traded company that
does business in the state -- regardless of where the company is
headquartered -- to disclose to state regulators a number of key
facts about its operations, executives and directors.</LD>
<TE>   The information will be filed on expanded forms that companies
will provide to the California secretary of state's office.</TE>
<TE>   Already, all companies, public and private, file a statement
providing their firm name, business address and the names of officers
and directors.</TE>
<TE>   Privately owned firms will continue to file that basic form but
now will be required to update the information each year, instead of
every other year.</TE>
<TE>   The new form to be filed by publicly traded companies each year
will require:</TE>
<TE>   * The name of the company's independent auditor and whether that
auditor has provided any other services for the company or its
affiliates in the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   * The annual pay of each member of the board and each of the five
most highly compensated officers.</TE>
<TE>   * A description of any loans made to a member of the board at a
"preferential" interest rate during the last two years, including the
rate and terms.</TE>
<TE>   * A statement indicating whether the company or any of its
executive officers or directors had filed for bankruptcy protection
or were convicted of fraud during the last 10 years, and a statement
indicating whether the company violated any federal securities laws
or state securities or banking laws in the last 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   The new law is "all about shining light on corporate activities
and allowing investors to make informed decisions," said Assemblyman
Kevin Shelley (D-San Francisco), who sponsored the statute.</TE>
<TE>   For public companies, most of the information the state wants
already is available in filings required by federal securities
regulators, Shelley acknowledged. The problem is finding it, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, information about auditors, fraud convictions and
bankruptcies must be included in voluminous annual 10-K reports filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and officer and director
compensation and loan agreements are in annual proxy statements filed
with the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   California's new law requires that the information be reported on
one form that the secretary of state's office must make available
online within two years. This will allow investors to gain access to
the data without spending hours poring through massive, often
technical documents, Shelley said.</TE>
<TE>   He is the Democratic candidate for secretary of state on this
week's ballot. Whichever candidate wins will be required, under the
new law, to collect the information and set up the electronic
database for public viewing.</TE>
<TE>   The law also creates a compensation fund for victims of corporate
fraud. The fund will be financed through filing fees imposed on all
companies registered in the state, public and private.</TE>
<TE>   Companies now pay $20 to file their information documents with the
state. That will rise to $25 in 2003. Half of the extra $5 in fees
will finance the online database. The other half will go to the
victims' fund.</TE>
<TE>   State officials, who say about 540,000 firms will be subject to
the filing fees, expect to collect $1.3 million for the victims' fund
annually. But how the money would be distributed to defrauded
investors isn't clear.</TE>
<TE>   The law requires the secretary of state's office to come up with
rules stipulating how and when companies must file the newly required
documents and who could qualify for victims' compensation.</TE>
<TE>   Although the law doesn't break new ground in terms of the
information it will make available, some experts believe it will be
helpful to investors.</TE>
<TE>   "More disclosure is basically good," said Ken Bertsch, vice
president and director of corporate governance at Moody's Investors
Service in New York. "If it's in a place where more people can pick
it up, that's helpful too."</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone is enthusiastic about the law.</TE>
<TE>   "If it were ours to control the world, we would have preferred
that it not have been enacted," said Fred Main, senior vice president
and general counsel at the California Chamber of Commerce. "We think
Sarbanes-Oxley [the new federal corporate disclosure law] is more
significant. But in the end, we were neutral."</TE>
<TE>   Lance Kimmel, partner with Los Angeles law firm Foley &amp; Lardner,
said the law is creating confusion for companies because details on
the filing process haven't been spelled out.</TE>
<TE>   "I receive several calls a day from California companies and
out-of-state companies that will be subject to this law because they
don't know what to do to comply," Kimmel said.</TE>
<TE>   "At this moment, all we can tell them is we have to wait and see."</TE>

<HD>GM Names Chief of Finance Unit</HD>
<DH>Eric Feldstein will be the new head of GMAC. He replaces
John Finnegan, who was appointed CEO at insurer Chubb.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>General Motors Corp. named Eric A. Feldstein on Sunday to head its
General Motors Acceptance Corp. finance unit, replacing John D.
Finnegan, who was named chief executive at Chubb Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Feldstein, 43, has been vice president of finance at General
Motors since June 2001 and corporate treasurer since December 1997,
the company said in a statement. He has been with General Motors
since 1981.</LD>
<LD>   GMAC had third-quarter earnings of $476 million, up from $437
million a year ago, while the parent company had a net loss of $804
million, or $1.42 a share, up from $368 million, or 41 cents, a year
earlier.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a huge financial services company in its own right,"
spokeswoman Toni Simonetti said of GMAC.</TE>
<TE>   The finance unit helps administer the automaker's no-interest
loans. GMAC borrows money at market rates and the parent company pays
the unit the difference, Simonetti said. General Motors has used
no-interest loans to spur auto sales over the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Feldstein, in the new post, will become a member of General
Motors' Automotive Strategy Board, which helps decide major auto
issues at the company, Simonetti said.</TE>
<TE>   "Eric brings strong firsthand GMAC experience, financial expertise
and leadership skills to this new assignment," GM Chief Executive
Rick Wagoner said in a statement. "I know he will build upon the
great work of the GMAC team to continue to be a profitable and
preeminent financial services company."</TE>
<TE>   Feldstein has a bachelor's degree in economics from Columbia
University and received a master of business administration degree
from Harvard University under the GM Fellowship Program in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   A successor to Feldstein was not immediately named.</TE>
<TE>   Finnegan, 53, will replace Dean R. O'Hare as CEO of Chubb
effective Dec. 1. O'Hare is retiring after 39 years with the company.</TE>
<TE>   The insurer also named director Joel J. Cohen as nonexecutive
chairman. Cohen, 64, is a former managing director at Donaldson
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc. and has been a Chubb director since 1984.</TE>
<TE>   Chubb also named Thomas Motamed to be vice chairman and chief
operating officer, and promoted John Degnan and Michael O'Reilly to
vice chairmen.</TE>
<TE>   Finnegan and Cohen are taking over a company that recently set
aside $625 million to pay for future asbestos claims. Chubb has been
raising prices across all lines of business, though some investors
say they worry that the company still faces bigger-than- expected
claims from directors' and officers' liability policies because of
corporate scandals.</TE>
<TE>   The board decided to separate the chairman and CEO functions "in
accordance with best practices in corporate governance," the company
said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   "As Chubb's senior outside director, Joel Cohen is thoroughly
familiar with the company and its operations, and he will play a key
role in orienting John with the company and the board," O'Hare said.</TE>
<TE>   The appointments come after Chubb posted a third-quarter loss of
$242.1 million because of asbestos claims. Investors say the asbestos
reserve increase should help smooth the transition and eliminate a
drag on earnings growth.</TE>
<TE>   The appointments also end a seven-month search that had many
investors worried that Chubb's inability to find a CEO might indicate
problems with its financial strength.</TE>

<HD>Antitrust Talks in EU May Resume</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>BRUSSELS</DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. is ready to restart talks with European Union
competition officials after a U.S. judge approved most of the
antitrust settlement the world's biggest software maker reached with
the Bush administration.</LD>
<LD>   A European Commission probe into whether Microsoft abused the
dominant position of its Windows operating system had been informally
suspended while officials on both sides waited to see what conditions
U.S. courts imposed.</LD>
<LD>   "Everybody involved in the case recognized it was important to
view what came out of the proceedings in the U.S.," Horacio
Gutierrez, Microsoft's top lawyer in Europe, said over the weekend.
"We don't suggest the commission relies on this decision, but we hope
they will look closely at it."</LD>
<TE>   The European Commission is investigating Microsoft's move into the
market for low-end servers, the hubs of computer networks.
Competition Commissioner Mario Monti also is looking at whether
Microsoft's bundling of Media Player software with Windows gives it
an unfair advantage.</TE>
<TE>   The commission declined to comment on the U.S. ruling. Monti's
deputy, Philip Lowe, said Oct. 25 that it was "not yet clear which
problems will be cleared up" by a U.S. resolution.</TE>
<TE>   The EU probe was triggered by a December 1998 complaint by Sun
Microsystems Inc., one of the biggest makers of computers that run
Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   The commission found that Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft engaged
in discriminatory licensing and refused to supply essential
information on Windows to server makers. Servers store and deliver
information for computer networks. Low-end systems are cheaper and
usually used for keeping files, printing and storing Internet data.</TE>
<TE>   The commission has maintained that its probe concerns different
allegations from those in the U.S. It could impose tougher conditions
on Microsoft and theoretically fine it as much as 10% of global
sales.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly on Friday approved the
settlement and denied requests by nine states to impose stiffer
penalties.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement allows computer makers to promote software programs
that compete with Microsoft's, and requires the company to charge the
top 20 computer makers uniform prices for Windows.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>An Internet company founded by a former Microsoft executive has filed
for bankruptcy protection after mounting losses throughout its
eight-year history.</LD>
<LD>   Network Commerce Inc. once employed more than 650 people and had a
stock market value of more than half a billion dollars. But by the
beginning of this year, its work force had shrunk to 65 people, and
it finished the second quarter with $1.6 million in cash.</LD>
<LD>   The company filed Friday for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.</LD>
<TE>   Network Commerce, formerly TechWave and ShopNow.com, was founded
by former Microsoft executive Dwayne Walker. It started out building
e-commerce storefronts, including BuySoftware.com and TryAndBuy.com.</TE>
<TE>   Later it moved into payment-processing software and
business-to-business electronic commerce, then changed into a
registry for domain names and an Internet hosting company.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle-based Network Commerce was removed from the Nasdaq Stock
Market in August 2001 after the stock traded below $1 for months. Its
shares, now traded on over-the-counter bulletin board markets, closed
Friday at 55 cents.</TE>

<HD>Holiday Parties Returning at Firms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Wei Gu</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Companies may be slashing jobs and other costs, but one ritual luxury
in the business world is making a comeback this year -- the annual
holiday party.</LD>
<LD>   Last year was one of the worst holiday seasons, as many U.S. firms
canceled their festivities because the mood just didn't feel right
after the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Although the Grinch may have throttled corporate entertainment
budgets in recent months and staffs are being told to cut back on
limousine services and other luxuries, the annual party is proving to
be resilient.</LD>
<TE>   "Companies may have a tendency to scale back the parties, but to
eliminate them, it's a pretty scary message," said Kathleen McKenna,
a partner at law firm Proskauer Rose, who advises on corporate
holiday parties.</TE>
<TE>   Some firms have returned to this routine. Cable network MSNBC, a
joint venture between Microsoft Corp. and NBC, told its staff that
after two straight years of cancellation because of recession, it's
going to break out the party glasses again.</TE>
<TE>   Party planners are exhilarated at the change.</TE>
<TE>   "I got seven inquiries of company parties yesterday alone," said
Lawrence Harvey, director of catering at the swank Plaza Hotel. "It
might be one of the best years we have ever had."</TE>
<TE>   However, don't expect Cristal champagne and Beluga caviar at the
annual office shindig. It's more likely to be wine in a box and
cheddar cheese on crackers.</TE>
<TE>   "The budget is about a third less," said David Chase, director of
catering at the Ritz-Carlton New York in lower Manhattan.</TE>

<HD>Bush Said to Be Close to Ousting SEC Chairman</HD>
<DH>No decision on Harvey Pitt is expected until after election
day. He could still stay on panel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Gerstenzang and Walter Hamilton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>ST. PAUL, Minn.</DL>
<LD>President Bush is near a decision to oust Harvey L. Pitt as chairman
of the Securities and Exchange Commission, a senior White House
official said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The decision on Pitt's future, however, isn't likely to be made
final, let alone public, until after Tuesday's elections and possibly
not until a bit later in the year. Bush could remove Pitt as SEC
chairman but cannot drive him off the independent commission if Pitt
refuses to go.</LD>
<LD>   "Everyone has come to the conclusion his days are numbered, but it
doesn't have to happen in the next 30 days," said a Republican
lobbyist close to the White House who asked not to be named.</LD>
<TE>   Pitt, who has been embroiled in controversy since he began his
term as SEC chief a year ago, sparked a new firestorm last week after
it was revealed that he did not disclose potentially damaging
information about William H. Webster, his choice to head the nation's
new accounting industry oversight panel.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt, from whom the White House had been distancing itself in
recent days even as it continued to express official support for him,
has annoyed key congressional Democrats and some Republicans with his
handling of Webster's appointment. SEC commissioners approved Webster
for the accounting-panel post in a partisan 3-2 vote on Oct. 25.</TE>
<TE>   A Pitt spokeswoman last week acknowledged that Pitt knew Webster
had led the audit committee of the board of U.S. Technologies Inc., a
small Washington-based company that last year fired its outside
accountants and has been sued by shareholders for alleged fraud.</TE>
<TE>   But Pitt did not tell others on the panel before the vote. Nor did
he tell White House Chief of Staff Andrew H. Card Jr., who was
encouraging Webster to take the job. That has put Card in an
embarrassing position.</TE>
<TE>   While Bush traveled from Florida to the upper Midwest to campaign
for Republican candidates in the midterm election, aides continued to
walk gingerly around the Pitt affair.</TE>
<TE>   Even as some raised the specter of his ouster, another Bush aide,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said to reporters that Pitt
"retains the confidence of the president."</TE>
<TE>   But that official added that the White House was "looking forward"
to a report by the SEC's inspector general on Pitt's handling of the
Webster case.</TE>
<TE>   Webster, a retired federal judge and former director of the FBI
and the CIA, has not come under fire because he informed Pitt of his
work for U.S. Technologies. A Pitt spokeswoman said last week that
Pitt had the SEC staff investigate Webster's tenure at U.S.
Technologies, and that the staff found "nothing of concern" to bring
to other commissioners.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, who was on his fourth consecutive day of campaigning for
Republicans on Sunday, has made no public mention of Pitt since the
Webster incident.</TE>
<TE>   Many longtime SEC observers said they would not be surprised if
Pitt's latest controversy costs him his job.</TE>
<TE>   "The job of being SEC chairman requires more than simply being a
very smart lawyer," said John Coffee, a Columbia University law
professor. "You must be a statesman."</TE>
<TE>   Though Pitt has many of the intellectual tools needed for the job,
his personality flaws have tripped him up, Coffee said.</TE>
<TE>   In his first year as chairman, Pitt has frequently come off as
arrogant and combative, and has made a number of gaffes that have
called into question his willingness to be tough in regulating the
accounting and securities industries. The need for closer regulation
has become a major political issue in the wake of the many corporate
accounting scandals this year.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt in recent days has pointed to the agency's stepped-up
enforcement efforts as proof that he is effective. But on one of the
biggest issues facing the SEC -- a crackdown on Wall Street analysts
for allegedly giving tainted stock advice during the bull market --
Pitt has been repeatedly upstaged by New York Atty. Gen. Eliot
Spitzer, who launched his own probe of Wall Street's conduct.</TE>
<TE>   As Spitzer pressed ahead with demand for tough reforms by major
brokerages, Pitt appeared to talk tough only when forced into a
political corner, critics said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's done any number of really stupid things," said Alan
Bromberg, a securities-law expert at Southern Methodist University.</TE>
<TE>   Christi Harlan, a Pitt spokeswoman at the SEC, said Sunday that
Pitt had not been informed that he might be asked to leave. "We've
heard nothing but support from the White House this weekend," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt's stumbles have surprised friends and supporters, said Laura
Unger, a former SEC commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really kind of baffling," she said. Like others, Unger, a
Republican, was stunned by Pitt's failure to share with the other
commissioners the information Webster gave him.</TE>
<TE>   Already, several people are being mentioned as possible Pitt
successors. One is James Doty, a former SEC general counsel who now
is a private attorney.</TE>

<HD>Shipping Lines, Union Continue Talking Over Weekend</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Verrier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The longshore workers union and the shipping industry continued their
talks through the weekend, moving a step closer to ending a logjam
that has disrupted commercial trade at West Coast ports.</LD>
<LD>   The International Longshore and Warehouse Union and the Pacific
Maritime Assn. negotiated all day Saturday and into Sunday evening in
an effort to settle differences over wages and benefits.</LD>
<LD>   Talks were expected to resume early today amid hopes among some
participants that a final agreement could be reached this week.</LD>
<TE>   Their hopes were elevated Friday after the two sides reached a
breakthrough compromise on the pivotal issue of labor-saving
technology.</TE>
<TE>   A source close to the negotiations, which are taking place at a
San Francisco hotel under the guidance of federal mediators,
described them as constructive.</TE>
<TE>   "Both sides are shooting to put this to bed," the source said.
"We're working very hard on it."</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Maritime Assn., representing shipping lines and
terminal operators, shut down all West Coast ports Sept. 29, saying
the union was engaging in disruptive work slowdowns to protest
stalled contract talks.</TE>
<TE>   The 10,500-member union said delays were related to a crush of
holiday season cargo and efforts by their members to observe strict
safety procedures after the deaths of five union members this year.</TE>
<TE>   The shutdown stranded billions of dollars worth of holiday cargo
before President Bush intervened. On Oct. 8, Bush obtained a federal
injunction to reopen the ports, an action that launched an 80-day
cooling-off period and cleared the way for the current talks.</TE>

<LD>A run of bad economic news last week and a disappointing report on
factory orders likely this week have U.S. economists all but certain
that Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve will lower borrowing
costs Wednesday to rescue a recovery in peril of grinding to a halt.</LD>
<LD>   "The economy's stalled," said economist Mark Zandi of Economy.com
in West Chester, Pa.</LD>
<LD>   Reports Friday showing a drop in the number of jobs in October for
the second straight month and reduced activity on factory floors
cemented a virtual consensus the Fed would cut rates for the first
time this year to stimulate activity.</LD>
<TE>   Today the Commerce Department is expected to report that factory
orders declined 3% in September.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. central bank's policymaking Federal Open Market
Committee, which has kept the federal funds rate at a four-decade low
of 1.75% this year, is widely expected to agree on a reduction.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the Institute of Supply Management will release its
non-manufacturing index. On Thursday, the Labor Department will
report on third-quarter productivity and on consumer credit in
September.</TE>

<HD>ASEAN Gears Up for Trade Pact With China</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southeast Asian nations may be wary of China's emergence as an
economic power, but they hope to make the best of a potentially
ominous threat by liberalizing trade.</LD>
<LD>   Leaders of the 10-member Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations are
expected to agree on a timetable for negotiating a deal with China
this week during their two-day summit in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.</LD>
<LD>   Business executives and government officials in countries such as
Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines figure that whatever they make
to sell to the global market, giant China -- with its massive supply
of low-cost labor and natural resources -- probably can make it
cheaper.</LD>
<TE>   But realizing there's little they can do as investors shift money
into China and away from other Asian economies, many are hoping to
find ways to tag along behind China's anticipated growth. Beijing
surprised many in the region about a year ago with an offer of a
free-trade deal.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SBC Communications Inc., one of the nation's largest Internet service
providers, plans to create a laboratory to test methods of defeating
viruses and attacks on Web sites.</LD>
<LD>   The decision to create the research center, to be announced today,
was endorsed by a top official of a government Internet security
board.</LD>
<LD>   But the reaction among some in the Internet security industry was
more cautious. They note that ISPs have opposed government
requirements to improve security, the investment in the laboratory
will be modest -- less than $10 million, according to SBC -- and it
won't be designed to warn customers of ongoing attacks.</LD>
<TE>   The SBC lab, to be based in Austin, Texas, will mimic servers,
firewalls and other structures of an ISP. Fred Chang, chief executive
of the unit that will run the lab, said the center could produce some
early anti-hacker technologies within 18 months.</TE>

<HD>Can Outside Research Clean Up the Street?</HD>
<DH>Critics say forcing brokerages to supply independent
opinions won't end conflicts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stock research by major Wall Street brokerages has been shown to be
tainted by inherent conflicts of interest. So securities regulators
have come up with a novel plan for reform: Force the brokerages to
give their investors the research of outside firms that don't face
the same kinds of conflicts.</LD>
<LD>   Backers say the idea would benefit individual investors by making
available to them a range of opinions on stocks -- specifically, the
opinions of analysts whose firms aren't also pursuing fee-rich
investment banking work from companies the analysts are covering.</LD>
<LD>   Many so-called independent research firms are small, little-known
operations that now primarily provide their work to institutional
investors.</LD>
<TE>   Critics say the idea would just create a new conflict of interest
by aligning the independent research boutiques with the
scandal-tainted brokerage giants.</TE>
<TE>   "We're kind of scratching our heads," said Scott Cleland, chief
executive of Precursor Group, a Washington-based independent research
firm. "The word 'independent' means 'not of Wall Street,' and now the
government's solution is to have Wall Street be a distributor of
independent research. We don't see how you remain independent."</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission and New York Atty. Gen.
Eliot Spitzer, along with other state regulators, have been
negotiating with the big brokerages in recent weeks, seeking a
"global" settlement of allegations of widespread misconduct by
analysts during the late-1990s bull market.</TE>
<TE>   Probes by New York, Massachusetts and congressional committees
this year have shown that some analysts touted stocks of even the
most fundamentally weak companies to help their firms win lucrative
banking work, such as underwriting stock offerings.</TE>
<TE>   As part of a settlement, it's expected that regulators would
demand that the 10 to 12 biggest brokerages shell out $1 billion over
five years to fund the work of independent research firms and make
that research available to their clients in addition to in-house
research.</TE>
<TE>   The brokerages have endorsed the accord in concept, but they
reportedly are bickering about how much each should pay. A deal could
be struck any time in the next few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan, an oversight panel would set standards for
independent research and decide which research firms would get
contracts to supply the brokerages.</TE>
<TE>   The panel would be expected to pick the "most accurate" research
firms for different stock sectors, say people familiar with the
negotiations. But the question of how to judge accuracy could become
contentious.</TE>
<TE>   For example, three firms might be picked to cover energy, so if a
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. client sought information on Duke Energy Corp.,
his broker would have to make available reports from those firms
along with reports by Merrill's in-house analyst, according to people
who have been part of the discussions.</TE>
<TE>   To be included, independent firms would have to swear they have no
investment banking ties and would have to meet other standards yet to
be determined.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope this will put integrity back into the [Wall Street]
research business and stimulate competition," said Darren Dopp, a
spokesman for Spitzer.</TE>
<TE>   Paul A. Volcker, a former Federal Reserve chairman, and John
Biggs, former head of the pension giant TIAA-CREF, have been
mentioned as possible nominees for the research panel.</TE>
<TE>   Yet critics question the idea of government-appointed bureaucrats
directing the process.</TE>
<TE>   Said Cleland: "Does anybody think a quasi-government body would be
good at picking stock pickers?"</TE>
<TE>   "Why not give investors everything and let the marketplace
decide?" said Samantha Topping, spokeswoman for Multex Inc., a New
York company that provides research, for fees, from more than 250
independent firms as well as from the big brokerages.</TE>
<TE>   Cleland said Precursor, for one, wouldn't compete for any of the
contracts. "It's temporary money and it's tainted money. It would
undermine our integrity," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dopp called the critics misguided. "It would not be the government
doing anything. This would be an independent panel and the money
would be escrowed," he said. "This is not going to be 'Eliot
Spitzer-sanctioned' research."</TE>
<TE>   Some independent firms concur, saying they don't believe
distribution of their reports through brokerages would taint their
work.</TE>
<TE>   "Our research already is being distributed through brokerage Web
sites as well as [financial] advisors and our investor newsletter,"
said Sandy Bragg, executive managing director at the Standard &amp;
Poor's Corp. investment services group in New York. "Wall Street
firms license our research today -- it's part of how we've built a
successful business model. We don't have any qualms about that."</TE>
<TE>   Other firms are taking a wait-and-see approach, saying key
questions need to be answered.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand they will pick the research firms based on accuracy,
but how do you define 'accuracy'?" asked John Eade, president of
Argus Research Co. in New York.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, "It will be interesting to see how they define
'independent.' It's hard to be totally conflict-free," said Eade, who
noted that his firm -- along with other such independents as Value
Line Inc. and Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. -- also operates a money
management business.</TE>
<TE>   Jean Buttner, chief executive of Value Line in New York, said, "No
government body has contacted us, so we don't know what they're
proposing. One thing is certain: People should have independent
research. It's badly needed, as you can see from all the scandals."</TE>
<TE>   Still, independent research is not necessarily superior, experts
caution.</TE>
<TE>   "Analysts can be independent but horrible stock pickers," said Kei
Kianpoor, CEO of Investars.com in Hoboken, N.J., which ranks
analysts' picks. "The folks at Morgan Stanley might provide far
better research despite their investment banking business."</TE>
<TE>   Kianpoor also noted that much of the research that boutique firms
provide has been tailored for institutional investors' specific
needs, which could make it difficult for small investors to digest or
use.</TE>
<TE>   For example, some research firms have thrived in a tough stock
market because hedge funds and other institutional clients need
"short-sale" candidates -- stocks to bet against, not on.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, the plan would at least "give investors a stronger
sense of the diversity of opinion," said John Coffee, a Columbia
University law professor. "More information is always better than
less."</TE>
<TE>   Coffee said analysts and brokers at the big Wall Street firms
might be shamed into providing more thoughtful work.</TE>
<TE>   "It may create a certain embarrassment cost: If a Merrill customer
sees that others are saying something different about a stock, that
might make [the broker] a little more modest in recommending it," he
said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Is Examining Government Contracts Meant for Small
Firms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Karen Robinson-Jacobs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Responding to a request from Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), the
Justice Department is examining whether large companies are
improperly obtaining government contracts that are supposed to be set
aside for small businesses.</LD>
<LD>   After receiving a letter in late September from Boxer, the U.S.
attorney's office in Washington assigned a lawyer to determine
whether a formal investigation is warranted.</LD>
<LD>   "In some matters, we decide right off the bat that this is not
something that falls into our purview," said Channing Phillips, a
spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office. "The fact that it's been
assigned should suggest that it's more than just a cursory review."</LD>
<TE>   Boxer sent her letter after hearing concerns raised by a
small-business advocate who heads a computer resellers group.</TE>
<TE>   "With small businesses in California facing a difficult business
environment, it is important that government contracts set aside for
small businesses be made available to small businesses," said Boxer
in the letter. She asked the U.S. attorney's office to determine
whether "certain companies have falsely claimed to qualify as small
businesses and won government contracts in violation of law."</TE>
<TE>   Under federal law, a firm can face "severe criminal penalties for
knowingly misrepresenting" small-business status in connection with
procurement programs, an SBA attorney said.</TE>
<TE>   Small businesses have long complained that loopholes in federal
law, sloppy government record keeping and, in some cases, outright
fraud result in large corporations getting millions of dollars in
federal contracts that Congress meant to go to small businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Updating the Small Business Act, Congress in 1997 decided that
federal agencies should strive to spend at least 23% of all federal
procurement dollars with small businesses. But large firms often find
ways to qualify for those set-asides.</TE>
<TE>   By most any yardstick, Buhrmann Co. would count as a large
company. One of the world's leading suppliers of office products, the
Amsterdam-based corporation employs 26,000 people in 28 countries and
had 2001 revenue of about $10 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Yet in the eyes of the U.S. government, Buhrmann subsidiary ASAP
Software can declare itself a small business and win federal
contracts accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   "Our employee count is what qualifies us" as a small business,
said Harry Zoberman, senior vice president of operations and
marketing ASAP Software. The Buffalo Grove, Ill., unit of Buhrmann
has 300 employees in the U.S. and an additional 200 workers around
the world.</TE>
<TE>   Though the rules can vary, many government contracts consider a
company with 500 or fewer employees to be small.</TE>
<TE>   Another company, GovConnection Inc., is listed on a federal
database of small companies even though it is a subsidiary of
Merrimack, N.H.-based PC Connection Inc.</TE>
<TE>   GovConnection has about 180 employees. But its parent is a holding
company with more than 1,300 employees and $1.18 billion in 2001
sales. Nearly $170 million came from federal contracts to
GovConnection, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   The Small Business Administration, which determines whether a
business is small, sent a letter in July 2001 to PC Connection,
saying the company and its wholly owned subsidiary, GovConnection,
were too big to be included in the agency's database of small
businesses seeking federal contracts.</TE>
<TE>   But as of last week, GovConnection still was listed in the SBA
database as a small firm. Gary Sorkin, president of GovConnection,
said he did not know why the SBA listing was still there.</TE>
<TE>   The firm also retains its "small" status with the federal General
Services Administration, which acts as a centralized government
purchasing organization.</TE>
<TE>   Under GSA rules, a firm awarded a government contract when it is
small can retain that status for the life of the accord, no matter
how large the company grows in the meantime.</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd Chapman, who heads the Micro Computer Industry Suppliers
Assn., the trade group that alerted Boxer to the issue, says the
situation is absurd.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't think of anything that's more unfair than forcing
legitimate small business to compete with some of the largest
companies in the world," said Chapman, who added that his employer, a
Novato, Calif.-based computer reseller, recently lost a
$50,000-contract to GovConnection. "You're cheating the legitimate
small businesses out of the opportunity that Congress meant for them
to have."</TE>
<TE>   In response to critics, the GSA plans to require firms to
recertify that they are still small when their contracts come up for
renewal, which at the most is every five years. Failure to do so
could lead to exclusion from federal contracting, according to Boyd
Rutherford, the GSA's associate administrator for the office of
enterprise development.</TE>
<TE>   Rutherford said the Office of Management and Budget is looking at
enacting similar changes for all federal agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "When a lot of these programs were set up, they did not envision
some of the long-term contracts that we have now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the increased government scrutiny of the problem,
Chapman is skeptical that any substantive change will come soon. He
has been trying to prompt reforms, he said, for 17 years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's heartbreaking to watch a legitimate small business go down
the tubes trying to compete against these international companies and
these Fortune 500 companies," Chapman said. "This is not sour grapes.
This is a system that needs to be changed."</TE>

<HD>For Investors, Time to Think About Swapping Funds</HD>
<DH>Dumping laggard mutuals for others with greater promise
could bring taxpayers a bonus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For stock mutual-fund owners, it's swap meet time: that time of year
when it makes sense to consider swapping poorly performing funds for
better ideas.</LD>
<LD>   And given the long bear market, a portfolio-cleaning this year
could pay a bonus. Investors may be able to dump lousy funds for
others with greater promise if the market recovers in 2003, while
getting a break on taxes by turning paper losses into realized ones.</LD>
<LD>   In a bull market, stock-fund shareholders at this time of year
normally would be sweating the annual November and December tradition
of capital gains distributions, when funds are required to pay out
their realized gains. But this year, taxable gains payouts should be
rare, given the market's dive for most of this year.</LD>
<TE>   That gives investors freer rein to consider upgrading their
portfolios in the next two months by selling disappointing funds and
replacing them with potentially better ideas for the longer run.</TE>
<TE>   And if a fund is held in a taxable account, Uncle Sam will help:
Realized losses on funds can be used first to offset any capital
gains an investor may have realized, and then to offset ordinary
income, up to $3,000.</TE>
<TE>   "It always makes sense to improve your portfolio, and if you have
a loss that's like icing on the cake," said Roy Weitz, a
self-appointed fund industry gadfly who founded the Tarzana-based Web
site FundAlarm.com.</TE>
<TE>   "With a 'sideways' trade, you can reestablish your position in the
same market sector and have the government subsidize your move a
little bit. If you're in a taxable account it's kind of a
no-brainer."</TE>
<TE>   As an example, Weitz said, an investor could sell a laggard
large-cap growth fund such as MFS Emerging Growth (down 20.6% a year
in the last three years) or Vanguard U.S. Growth (off 25.5% a year in
the same period), and put the proceeds into Bramwell Growth, a
large-cap growth fund that has performed far better during the bear
market, losing 6.4% a year over the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, just because a fund has held up better than its peers
in the bear market doesn't necessarily mean it will excel if the
market recovers.</TE>
<TE>   But a bear market can expose professional stock pickers'
weaknesses. For fund owners, it's worth asking whether they can do
better with new managers.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Fabian, editor of the Successful Investing newsletter in
Huntington Beach, said investors need to guard against complacency
even though the market overall has been dispiriting.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm encouraging investors to be more active with their fund
portfolio," said Fabian, whose Web site, www.fabian.com, maintains a
quarterly "lemon list" of laggard funds. "It's like tending the
garden -- it needs maintenance."</TE>
<TE>   Through last week, the average U.S. stock fund was down 20.7% year
to date and an annualized 7.1% over three years, according to fund
tracker Morningstar Inc. in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   By making a switch right away within the same fund category,
investors can stay exposed to the same segment of the market, so they
probably won't have to watch in agony if their former fund roars back
to life. Major stock market indexes have advanced for four
consecutive weeks, raising new hopes that the bear market may finally
have run its course.</TE>
<TE>   It never makes sense to let the tax tail wag the investment dog,
as the experts say, but realized capital losses can be of significant
help to taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   Investors can use a loss to help shelter the taxable portion of a
gain from a home sale, for example, said Philip J. Holthouse, partner
in the Los Angeles tax law and accounting firm Holthouse Carlin &amp; Van
Trigt.</TE>
<TE>   Losses that exceed realized capital gains can be written off
against regular income, up to $3,000 per single taxpayer or couple
filing a joint return. (If spouses file separately, the limit is
$1,500 each.)</TE>
<TE>   Because regular income, such as wages, dividends and interest, is
taxed at a higher rate than capital gains, a $3,000 capital loss
applied against regular income can come in handy. For a California
taxpayer earning $50,000, a $3,000 capital loss works out to about
$1,100 in combined federal and state tax savings, Holthouse said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, losses beyond $3,000 can be carried forward
indefinitely. So if you were unfortunate enough to plow, say,
$200,000 into an Internet stock fund two years ago, you might have a
lifetime worth of write-offs available if you sell the fund.</TE>
<TE>   Even investors who have been in funds since the earlier days of
the 1990s' bull market might have surprising paper losses, said
Russel Kinnel, director of fund analysis at Morningstar. Investors
who reinvested their annual capital gains distributions over the
years may have a higher "cost basis" for tax purposes than they
realize because those reinvestments were used to buy more shares as
prices rose.</TE>
<TE>   The fund-swapping strategy carries numerous caveats, however:</TE>
<TE>   * In a tax-deferred retirement account such as a 401(k), it's
pointless: Just as gains don't hurt you, tax-wise, in those accounts,
losses don't help.</TE>
<TE>   * While "no load" fund investors generally don't have to worry
about fees when entering or exiting a fund, those who prefer "load"
funds, which come with advice of the professional advisors who
typically sell them, might find that swapping is not worth the extra
commissions.</TE>
<TE>   * Investors must focus on their specific gain or loss based on
their personal holding period.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't make assumptions," Weitz said. "If you've held Invesco
Dynamics for a long time, even though it's a stinker, you might not
have a loss in the fund." Indeed, that fund is down 18.6% a year over
the last three years, but up about 9% a year over the last 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Usually, it makes sense to stay within the same fund category when
making a switch, analysts say. This guards against
performance-chasing: buying into a hot -- in other words, expensive
-- fund category rather than a bargain.</TE>
<TE>   For long-term investors, performance-chasing can be costly. Just
ask those who bought technology funds in winter 2000, when that mania
was peaking.</TE>
<TE>   Yet some investors may have good reason to change categories when
swapping funds, Fabian said. "Think of this as a chance to see if you
are properly allocated," he said. "If I'm dubious about tech I'm not
going to be dumping Pimco Innovation just to turn around and buy
Fidelity Select Technology."</TE>
<TE>   Investors also can address overlap, Fabian said: "Do you really
need three large-cap growth funds? If I go to a restaurant, I'm not
going to order three chicken dishes."</TE>
<TE>   When making a swap, investors need to be careful about the IRS'
so-called wash sale rules. If you sell a stock or fund at a loss, and
then buy one that is "substantially identical" within 30 days, the
IRS considers it a "wash" and voids the tax break.</TE>
<TE>   Selling Fidelity's Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index fund and buying
Vanguard's, or vice versa, would raise IRS eyebrows, Holthouse said.
Buying another blue-chip fund such as Fidelity Contrafund or Vanguard
Total Stock Market Index would be fine, however.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most important in the swap decision, funds need to be
judged fairly -- not simply sold because they are down. In a bear
market, just about every stock investment loses ground.</TE>
<TE>   Kinnel said he would consider a fund's three-, five- and 10-year
records against its category average.</TE>
<TE>   "Even the best funds have bad years," he said. This year, for
example, Vanguard Capital Opportunity and Vanguard Primecap are
slumping, but the team that runs both funds has an outstanding
long-term mark, Kinnel said.</TE>
<TE>   Fabian and Weitz have similar formulas of their own for their
lists of "lemon" and "three-alarm" funds. The common ground: If a
fund has been a laggard relative to its peers in good markets and
bad, dump it.</TE>
<TE>   Relative performance isn't the only reason to make a fund swap,
however, Kinnel said.</TE>
<TE>   If a successful manager departs, you may not want to take a chance
on the new skipper. You may also want to bail if a fund is merged
into another one by the company, Kinnel said.</TE>
<TE>   "Why let the fund company decide where your money goes, when you
can sell the fund, book the loss and pick the fund you want?"</TE>
<TE>   Although it's never a simple decision to sell a fund, Holthouse
said several of his clients have harvested fund losses this year, in
part for tax planning.</TE>
<TE>   "They figure it's kind of like home refinancing," he said. "If the
stock market goes down again, they can always do it again."</TE>

<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>UAL Corp.'s United Airlines said Sunday that it reached a tentative
agreement with its meteorologists' union, the latest labor group to
negotiate concessions the airline says it needs to avert a bankruptcy
filing.</LD>
<LD>   Details of the agreement, which was reached with leaders of the
Transport Workers Union, weren't released because they must first be
shared with the union members, United said. The company employs about
20 meteorologists. The union members and United's board and labor
committee must all approve the agreement.</LD>
<LD>   Unions have been negotiating with the world's second-largest
airline on how to achieve $5.8 billion in labor savings over 5 1/2
years. UAL has said it needs to cut costs to win a federal loan
guarantee that will help it raise $2 billion and pay $945 million in
debt before year's end.</LD>
<TE>   The top union council for United's pilots approved a concession
plan Friday that would provide the company with $2.2 billion in labor
savings over 5 1/2 years. Pilots must still approve the plan.</TE>

<DH>Politicians should come with warning labels.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joseph H. Cooper</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We're going about this election stuff all wrong. We need benchmarks
-- objective, truly qualitative and even quantitative standards by
which we can evaluate a candidate's attributes. We look at "the
comparables" before we buy a house and at ratings when purchasing a
car or household appliance. Maybe we should think about candidates as
products.</LD>
<LD>   Appliances are rated based on their energy efficiency. For
example, by dividing an air conditioner's capacity rating (measured
in BTUs) by the wattage it consumes, we arrive at the unit's EER, its
energy efficiency rating. OK, stay with me on this one: By dividing a
candidate's cooling-off capacity (measured in terms of Bipartisan
Transaction Units) by his propensity to create partisan discord, we
arrive at the candidate's EER, his Equanimity-Enmity Ratio.</LD>
<LD>   Cars are rated as to their fuel efficiency, resale value and
safety. How about rating politicians based on their Ministrations Per
Groundswell or their Malapropisms Per Grandstand? How about judging
them by the way they come away from a head-on collision with their
ideological opposites?</LD>
<TE>   Drugs are subject to lots of evaluations, tests and comparisons.
When a candidate is touted as a cure for all our ills, wouldn't it be
great to know whether he can actually bring about the relief
promised, in the time promised? Shouldn't we be apprised of a
recommended dosage or exposure? How about cautions as to harmful
interactions and possible side effects? Shouldn't candidates be
obliged to disclose all major funding sources and the extent of these
contributions, which, after all, are candidates' real "active
ingredients"?</TE>
<TE>   Consumers make foodstuff purchases based, in part, on price and
the disclosures made on the product packaging. Wouldn't it be great
to be able to weigh the merits of political campaigns based on their
"fat" content. Wouldn't it be helpful to readily discern which
campaign is genuinely natural and wholesome, committed to providing
us with a minimum amount of our daily requirements and not made up of
fillers and artificial sweeteners?</TE>
<TE>   Bonds are rated. Those asked to contribute to a particular
election campaign may be concerned about "safety of principal" (if
not "safety of principle"); they should have a way of knowing whether
the candidate being touted is "investment grade." Is the candidate
likely to meet his political debt obligations?</TE>
<TE>   Campaign finance reform could be a lot simpler if we thought of
candidates as small-cap stocks and mid-cap stocks. Contributing money
to the campaign of a relatively unknown -- small-cap -- candidate
carries more risk than investing in the campaign of a large-cap
incumbent, but the leverage possibilities are greater.</TE>
<TE>   The campaigns of mid-cap candidates are less speculative than the
small-cap ventures, but dividends are by no means certain.</TE>
<TE>   However, a portfolio of mid-caps can be a hedge against some of
the vicissitudes of the political markets.</TE>
<TE>   Alas, misrepresentation is rife in securities offerings, so the
limited-partnership joint ventures between candidates and
contributors may not yield reliable ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Better to have food-and-drug disclosures: Is the guy salty?
Acidic? Can he relieve pain, congestion and stress, without making us
drowsy?</TE>
<TE>   Hey, at core, candidates are packaged goods.</TE>

<HD>The War We Have Chosen to Lose</HD>
<DH>The education front requires reinforcement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Arthur Levine</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Imagine if our government conducted the war against terrorism the way
it carries out urban school improvement. President Bush would, as he
did after Sept. 11, express his personal anger, our national resolve
to rebuild, America's commitment to root out the causes of the
tragedy. He would declare war.</LD>
<LD>   Then, if he followed the path of urban school reform, the
president would say terrorism would not be overcome by throwing money
at the problem. For the most part, the United States does not need to
spend more; it needs to spend smarter.</LD>
<LD>   Next the president would tell us the war required superb foot
soldiers. However, the experienced and qualified soldiers with cushy
postings -- let's say the U.S. Embassy in Paris -- would not be sent
to Afghanistan. Raw recruits would go, without any training and less
pay than soldiers in the attractive postings.</LD>
<TE>   The president would go on to say that good equipment was essential
to winning. But times are tough, so the new recruits will have to
make do with World War II surplus and simply double their
determination. Because the general staff failed to recognize the
terrorist menace until it was too late, Bush would ask one of the
nation's most successful businessmen -- an individual with a track
record in overcoming adversities and building successes -- to lead
the troops into war and enforce clear, tough standards for victory.</TE>
<TE>   This is, of course, a ludicrous scenario. But it is exactly what
is happening in urban school improvement.</TE>
<TE>   Today, urban public schools are attended principally by low-income
and minority children who start school with weaker academic skills
and knowledge than their suburban peers. They live in environments
that are less supportive of schooling. Yet urban public schools
receive lower funding than suburban schools and pay their teachers
20% to 30% less.</TE>
<TE>   They are, as a result, forced to hire growing numbers of people
who are unqualified to teach. For instance, a recent study found that
70% of middle-school math teachers in high-minority schools in
impoverished areas had neither a major nor a minor in mathematics.
Children who most need the best teachers are getting the least able.</TE>
<TE>   Urban public schools have far poorer facilities and plants than
suburban schools. They suffer inadequate and often dated curriculum
materials compared with suburban schools. After 20 years of a school
reform movement in the U.S., with two arguable exceptions -- Houston
and San Diego -- no urban school system in the country has ever
successfully turned around.</TE>
<TE>   What did happen is that suburban schools, which were far better
than urban schools at the beginning of the reform movement, got
stronger. And all but low-income children simply left inner-city
public schools -- the affluent choosing private schools, the middle
class decamping to the suburbs or wrangling spots in magnet or
selective public schools or choosing religious schools. Only the poor
are really stuck.</TE>
<TE>   The almost inescapable conclusion is that the U.S. does not care
about urban schools and the children who attend them. The parents of
urban schoolchildren vote at lower rates than the suburban
population; higher proportions are immigrants. Of course, if quality
of schooling became a litmus issue in voting or the focus of
community activism, government might respond better.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's urban public schools will not substantially improve
without a sufficient investment. The improvement with the greatest
effect on student learning is a well-prepared and experienced
teacher. These teachers will not work in inner cities until salaries
and incentives are higher than in suburbs, which offer easier working
conditions. States, but also Washington, have to invest more heavily
in cities than in suburbs if they expect to see real changes. Putting
businessmen in charge and installing standards and tests won't win
the war either.</TE>
<TE>   Urban public schools need teachers, facilities and curriculum
materials. The argument that there is no money doesn't make sense.
There is money for tax cuts, money for war, money to bail out
faltering industries. How can there be no money for children and
schools?</TE>

<HD>Drug Tests' Costly Side Effects</HD>
<DH>Pediatric trials only drive up prices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Henry I. Miller</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Antibiotics or a tube of prescription steroid cream used to cost a
few bucks, but now the prices are soaring. A few examples of the cost
of a week's supply of drugs: the antibiotic clarithromycin, $63;
celecoxib, for arthritis, $85; and erythropoietin, for anemia, $218.</LD>
<LD>   In large part, this is your tax dollars at work. Government
regulation imposes, in effect, enormous taxes on drug development
that are ultimately passed along to consumers. They also decrease
innovation and the number of drugs that are developed.</LD>
<LD>   A prime example of flawed policy is the FDA's 1997 decision to
require drug companies to test in children the medicines they sell
for adults. The good news is that last month  a federal court
nullified the policy. "The pediatric rule exceeds the Food and Drug
Administration's statutory authority and is therefore invalid," said
Judge Henry H. Kennedy Jr. of the District of Columbia federal court.</LD>
<TE>   The bad news is that Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.), who championed
the policy during the Clinton years, is now the chief Senate
proponent of legislation to turn the testing requirements into law.</TE>
<TE>   Pediatric trials of new medicines might sound like a good thing,
but this one-size-fits-all requirement ignores the realities of drug
testing.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA can, for instance, withhold approval of new drugs even for
adult uses while the required pediatric studies are completed. The
regulation is a rigid, centralized government solution to what is
usually a nonproblem.</TE>
<TE>   Even the FDA concedes that physicians commonly and safely
prescribe pain relievers, asthma drugs, antihistamines, antibiotics
and other therapeutics millions of times annually for children,
without separate clinical trials. Even in cases where additional
testing of drugs in children is needed, there are more imaginative
and effective ways to accomplish it.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law already offers financial incentives, in the form of
extended patent rights, to companies that voluntarily perform
pediatric testing. The FDA could also require a prominent label on
drug preparations whose safety and efficacy had not yet been
determined in children and publish a list of such drugs annually.</TE>
<TE>   Creating a formulation for children is often challenging, tedious
and expensive. Can the active ingredient be incorporated in a
chewable or syrup form? Will it have adequate shelf life? A pediatric
form of Glaxo Wellcome's antibiotic Ceftin required more than double
the development cost and man-hours of the adult drug. The same
company also struggled to find effective preservatives for its
pediatric syrup form of Epivir, an AIDS drug, even after the adult
formulation was fully developed.</TE>
<TE>   Clinical trials are especially difficult with children. Study
participants may be scarce because a disease is rare in children and
subjects are few, or because parents are reluctant to enroll their
sick children in an "experiment."</TE>
<TE>   Also, "children" are not a homogeneous group, but encompass
newborns, infants, preschoolers, primary-schoolers and teenagers,
confounding the analysis of data.</TE>
<TE>   As regulatory requirements overall are shoved upward, the approval
pipeline slows. The time from synthesis of the new drug molecule to
the patient's bedside has almost doubled over three decades, from 8.1

drug approved is by far the most expensive in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Why does the FDA impose unnecessary, expensive regulations? As

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>A little more than a year ago the Taliban ruled Afghanistan and
cracked the whip in the name of Allah. There was no future in this
captive nation, only a dreadful present. Women were banned from the
workforce. Thousands of families headed by "war widows" had no means
of support. Girls' schools and colleges were shuttered. Music,
television, video, chess, soccer and kite flying were banned. Regular
Friday lashings, amputations and executions were held at the city
soccer stadium. Two symbols of enlightenment, the pair of giant
Buddha statues that for centuries had peacefully stood watch over
silk route travelers, were demolished. Then the American bombing
campaign began, and change came swiftly.</LD>
<LD>   Today in Kabul, determination and optimism mix with insecurity.
Youngsters play soccer in the roads and parks. Kites, favored by
Afghans of all ages, are in the air. Young Afghan men and women brim
with excitement, eager to rebuild, to write their own history.</LD>
<TE>   But they worry about next year. More than two decades of war left
houses, public buildings and infrastructure demolished. Medical
facilities, food, clean water, electricity and jobs are in short
supply. Civilians have died in errant U.S. bombings. Remnants of the
Taliban and Al Qaeda still plant bombs and try to assassinate the
people's new leaders. The fundamentalist leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar
has declared a new jihad. As winter approaches, there is a widespread
expectation of violence.</TE>
<TE>   Yet when I ask an Afghan, "Are you better off today than you were
a year ago?" the answer is invariably yes. Whether that answer can
last depends on the fulfillment of the world's pledges of
reconstruction aid.</TE>
<TE>   Assistance so far has been mostly in the form of relief, which is
short-term and safe. It gives donors an easy exit and the opportunity
to highlight popular humanitarian programs. Reconstruction, by
contrast, requires staying around--for perhaps a decade or more. It
is slow to show results and carries an uneasy air of permanence that
frightens donors. However, nothing would drive the country back to
disintegration faster than unfulfilled Afghan expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan is still real estate trying to become a nation-state.
U.S. aid should help by promoting a stable government that reflects
human dignity and an equitable balance among ethnic demands and
claims. The International Security Assistance Force must be quickly
and effectively expanded across the country. Visible, labor-intensive
projects such as road-building and garbage and sewage management
projects should be top priorities. Afghan decision-makers need
training in how to develop policy and run a government.</TE>
<TE>   Show Americans at their best. Bring in the Peace Corps, build a
new American library and form civil-society partnerships with private
educational, human rights, medical, media and legal organizations.</TE>
<TE>   I remember the sad faces of Afghan refugees when the American
cultural center and library in Peshawar, Pakistan, was closed in the
mid-1990s. It was a place where a young refugee could borrow a book,
young women could safely exchange ideas and ordinary Afghans could
learn about democracy and human rights. I often wonder how many young
people who once read about Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln in
the American library became radicalized in the Taliban madrasas, or
religious schools, because they had nowhere else to go.</TE>
<TE>   Another sharp memory: In the early 1980s, I crossed the Khyber
Pass with Abdul Haq, then a young moujahedeen commander who had left
Kabul University to fight the Soviet army. "This is a difficult time
for Afghanistan," he said, "but a better year is coming."</TE>
<TE>   It took more than 20 years for that time to arrive, and Haq, by
then a respected regional leader, did not live to see it. He died a
year ago in a Taliban ambush while aiding the U.S.-led war. But he
believed that a dignified Afghanistan would come.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you better off today than you were a year ago?" I asked a
young Afghan woman who had shed her burka and now studied journalism.
"Yes," she said. "This year is much better." Next year must be better
as well.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Indian casino gambling generates a huge amount of cash, but it also
has opened the door to a host of new problems for California,
including controversy throughout the state over the uncontrolled
effects of casino construction and expansion on local communities.</LD>
<LD>   In 2000, Indian tribes gained the right through a voter-approved
ballot initiative to operate Las Vegas-style blackjack and poker
tables, as well as thousands of new slot machines on tribal lands
throughout California. The casino operators claim that tribal
sovereignty makes them immune from state and local laws and rules. In
their view, that means they don't have to pay taxes and observe
regulations like other businesses in the state, although larger
casinos do pay some fees. It's a murky legal area that needs to be
clarified in the courts. The next governor should use his power to
negotiate new casino compacts to give state and local governments
more authority over the casinos.</LD>
<TE>   In the meantime, the deal that Yolo County officials negotiated
with the Rumsey Band of Wintun Indians last month over expansion of
its gambling casino is the best any local government has done. The
Rumsey Band runs the Cache Creek casino, with 1,130 slot machines and
blackjack and poker tables, in Yolo County's bucolic Capay Valley
about 50 miles west of Sacramento. Fearing competition from other
tribal casinos, the tribe proposed to triple the size of the casino
and build a six-story hotel and a 4,900-space garage. Area residents,
echoing statewide complaints about expansion of casinos, protested
that the project would cause environmental damage and clog roads. The
Wintuns tried to be good neighbors. They cut the casino expansion by
about a third. There will be a hotel of four stories, not six. But
the casino can expand again after 2008.</TE>
<TE>   The tribal compacts negotiated with Gov. Gray Davis in 1999 say
tribes must make a good-faith effort "to incorporate the policies and
purposes" of environmental laws "consistent with the tribe's
governmental interests." Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer says he has no
authority to enforce the 62 existing tribal compacts, leaving it up
to the tribes themselves and a state commission with questionable
powers. The state should have a vigorous enforcement agency.</TE>
<TE>   The next governor has the power to seek more state and local
control over casinos when the tribal compacts automatically come up
for renegotiation early next year. He should clear up ambiguities and
limit further extension of casino gambling. Davis promised there
would be no major expansion of gambling, but there are now 50 tribal
casinos in the state pulling in roughly $5 billion a year in slot
machine revenue alone. That's only a guess, because, believe it or
not, the tribes say they don't have to report how much money they
make -- another flaw that needs to be fixed in the new compact talks.</TE>

<LD>One of the intended consequences of the Internet is the flood of
information available to anyone with access to the Web. One of the
unintended consequences of the Internet is the flood of
misinformation that gets out there too. And rumors. And myths.
There's no end. They're like that arcade game where gophers pop up
from one hole after another. Who can hit them all? And though humans
have magnified their ability to make and transmit information,
they've done nothing to improve their truth-seeking capacity.</LD>
<LD>   As one result, you may have missed the recent news from the
Journal of the National Cancer Institute that underarm deodorant does
not cause cancer. Humans have displayed a proclivity over the
centuries to believe almost anything -- that the Earth is flat, the
moon is cheese, kings know best, the Angels will never win a World
Series. And that proclivity to believe is particularly strong if the
news is bad, despairing or scary. Scandal news spreads quickest, of
course. Which grabs your attention first: a neighbor has an affair
with a next-door widow or a colleague buys a new hat and makes her
mortgage payments on time? See?</LD>
<TE>   Now, a fair number of us were oblivious to the fictitious danger
lurking in our armpits because we had focused on Nostradamus, shark
attacks, subliminal advertising and evil sorcery hidden within
corporate logos. But the Great Deodorant Drama has all the
ingredients for an enduring urban myth -- an innocent activity
performed daily by almost everybody that in the end might be
invisibly lethal. That's worse than pantyhose causing an extra layer
of fat on legs.</TE>
<TE>   The deodorant and antiperspirant myth has circulated for more than
a decade but gained heightened credibility apparently through
infinite forwarding of an anonymous e-mail detailing an alleged case.</TE>
<TE>   Like the neighbor's affair with the widow, it's passed on and on
and on. Scientists knew this was bunk, of course. But when Dana
Mirick, an epidemiologist at Seattle's Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center, checked the scientific literature, no one had proven
the negative -- one of countless negatives yet to be proven, by the
way. So for nearly three years, the study examined the personal
hygiene habits of 813 women with breast cancer and 793 without. No
connection with deodorant. None. Not even when they shaved and
immediately applied deodorant. Totally safe. So spread the word, that
urban myth you didn't know about anyway is finally countered.</TE>
<TE>   But two questions do remain: What do you suppose tooth whitener
might do to kidneys? And why don't country residents have rural
myths?</TE>

<HD>A Diet for Ailing Airlines</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The word "Amtrak" should be all it takes to persuade policymakers of
the need to assert fiscal discipline in dealing with the nation's
troubled airlines.</LD>
<LD>   United Airlines, the largest carrier operating out of Los Angeles
and San Francisco, faces a rough ride, even by the standards of an
industry awash in turbulence. Parent company UAL posted an
$889-million third-quarter loss. Union workers, who own 55% of the
company, tentatively have agreed to $5.8 billion in concessions --
but their retirement fund threatens to sell off anemic UAL shares.</LD>
<LD>   Bankruptcy looms for United, the world's second-largest airline,
and it is lobbying fiercely for a $1.8-billion federal loan
guarantee, which it describes as necessary to bridge an approaching
cash shortfall.</LD>
<TE>   The loan guarantee program that Congress passed after 9/11 made
good sense. But it is clear that hard-pressed airlines must be viable
in the long run before knocking on Uncle Sam's door -- or the nation
risks traveling a dangerous track similar to the one that led to the
heavily subsidized Amtrak rail system. The possibility of war and an
oil price hike underscores that airlines must operate on a sound
financial footing.</TE>
<TE>   The federal Air Transportation Stabilization Board, which is
reviewing United's application, must remember that such loans are to
deal with problems created in the wake of Sept. 11 -- not
long-standing issues. Loan guarantees make little sense if an
airline's costs -- including wages and salaries -- remain out of
balance with demand. And good service and attractive ticket prices
are crucial.</TE>
<TE>   Airlines already have grounded enough workers and aircraft to
create a substantial new carrier. But the pain isn't over. The
industry lost a cumulative $7 billion in 2001 and will lose another
$7 billion this year.</TE>
<TE>   Economics texts say that Bankruptcy Court is exactly where an
unprofitable airline belongs. United argues that a loan guarantee is
the solution to its woes.</TE>
<TE>   What's needed is a middle course similar to the one taken by US
Airways Group, which won a loan guarantee but also negotiated
substantial labor concessions and is using Bankruptcy Court to shed
unprofitable routes and reorganize its finances.</TE>
<TE>   Using bankruptcy to knock well-paid pilots into a lower tax
bracket might make some envious souls feel better, and winning a loan
guarantee might spare airline executives some sleepless nights. But
neither is guaranteed to make an airline attractive to the flying
public.</TE>
<TE>   To give United the loan guarantee it's after, the federal board
must decide whether the company has shed enough excess costs. It must
also see a business plan that meets consumer demand for solid service
and competitive pricing. When the economy does rebound, that's what
the flying public will want. Absent the traveling public's
endorsement, airlines risk becoming another subsidized drain on the
economy.</TE>

<LD>Re "Crime Up in 2001, FBI Says," Oct. 29: Let's not assume this is a
done deal. The dramatic declines in the 1990s were no accident,
despite the fact that experts can't pinpoint a single reason. Why
should they be? Violence has many causes and, so, many solutions. In
our state, for example, there was an enormous increase in funding for
youth crime and violence prevention programs, from $8.3 million in
fiscal year 1992-93 to $373.7 million in fiscal year 2001-02. About
half as many handguns were sold in 2000 as were in 1993 and, what a
surprise, in 2000 there were half as many homicides because of
firearms.</LD>
<LD>   Crime, and the violence associated with it, is not inevitable --
it's preventable. We know because the declines we saw in the 1990s
were, in large part, because of the concerted efforts of communities
united across the state to reduce the number of handguns available
and shift some of California's resources to prevention. It worked,
and it can keep working if we keep at it. This is no time to stop
doing what we know works, from Escondido to Mendocino.</LD>

<LD>Thanks for your great Oct. 25 photo of the fisherman feeding the
egrets from fish he had caught himself at Balboa Lake in Encino.
Unfortunately, birds do not always benefit so greatly from the
fishermen's presence there. The day before your photo appeared, while
walking around Balboa Lake, I came upon three birds -- a pelican, a
coot and a black bird -- that had become entangled in plastic fishing
line that had carelessly been forgotten and left lying on the ground.
All three birds were badly limping.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, I'm not even sure that the pelican will be able to fly
until somebody helps it get untangled, which is not an easy feat, as
the birds are wild and scare easily.</LD>
<LD>   As I understand, California law allows fishing in all bodies of
water. But fishermen need to show more thoughtfulness and be more
responsible regarding fishing lines and fishing weights and take
their fishing gear home each time if they really want to help our
feathered friends.</LD>

<LD>Your Oct. 31 article, "Costly House Race Set in Land of Poverty,"
suggests that a good part of the West Virginia election war chest
comes from the parties. And where did the two parties get the money?
From outside the state. The two parties have raised $200 million
nationwide in a nonpresidential election year.</LD>
<LD>   So does it make a difference whether the contest site is rich or
poor? Parties use national money. And money, the preferred voting
medium, provides two choices on election day -- two ideologies. But
in practice the two ideologies look and smell the same.</LD>
<LD>   And voters throughout the country, turned off by the lack of
choice, either stay home or vote for a personality. This year, it is
either politician X, who ideologically favors business, demonizes his
opposition and waves the flag, or it is politician Y, who clucks
disapproval of his opponent's lack of attention to the economy while
bowing and scraping to demands of war.</LD>
<TE>   Generally neither party works the issues. They silhouette around
them. Dab at them. But mostly do a lot of posturing.</TE>

<LD>Most of us agree that the Getty Villa museum is a gem, and we look
forward to the reopening so we can again enjoy its many treasures
("Getty Villa a Gem for Us All," editorial, Oct. 27). My issue is not
with the museum but with the outdoor theater designed for up to 950
occupants for day and night performances, with amplified sound and
lighting. I'm not alone in my concern. Every homeowners organization
in the area shares the concern, and they have joined in opposition to
this inappropriate expansion in a residential neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   We have attempted to negotiate with the Getty, but from day one it
has said this is nonnegotiable. It is only the L.A. City Council that
has placed some restrictions on use, not the Getty. Its latest
"offer," you ask? Let us do everything we want and give us your land
at the entrance to your neighborhood to pay our lawyer fees. Doesn't
sound like much of a gem to me.</LD>

<HD>In a State Post, Poet Baraka Isn't Free to Promote Hate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Rhyme and Reason of Free Speech," by Norah Vincent, Commentary,
Oct. 31:</LD>
<LD>   The proposed termination of Amiri Baraka as poet laureate of New
Jersey is not a free-speech issue. As a private citizen, Baraka is
free to spout whatever venomous lies he chooses. He is not free,
however, to promulgate hatred and anti-Semitism as a representative
of the state of New Jersey any more than a fundamentalist Christian
is free to teach creationism in a public school science class.</LD>
<LD>   In saying that Baraka violated "nothing except the rules of common
decency" and therefore should be allowed to retain his position,
Vincent is implying that a state should tolerate the expression of
any and all lies by state representatives.</LD>
<TE>   New Jersey has every right to defenestrate him (I'd throw him out
the window myself!) and let him engage in public art as a private
citizen.</TE>
<TE>   Frances Segal</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Niguel</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I agree with Vincent's conclusion that Baraka should not be fired
as New Jersey's poet laureate. Other artists' heads might soon be
rolling.</TE>
<TE>   That said, I condemn his preposterous poem, "Somebody Blew Up
America" -- not so much for its lies and distortions as for its
artistic quality. It is painful to see an honored poet present such
bad work. Nevertheless, Baraka should not be punished for being the
political and artistic radical he's been for half a century. He has
given poetry an unaccustomed place in the headlines.</TE>
<TE>   Sherman Pearl</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps New Jersey Gov. James E. McGreevey should not have asked
"poet" Baraka for his resignation. The fact remains that the state
should not have hired him in the first place. There is no
justification for public expenditure to support anything that is not
accountable to the public.</TE>

<HD>Affordable Housing With Proposition 46</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm going to vote for the housing measure, Proposition 46, although
there are serious problems with it.</LD>
<LD>   The fairest housing program would be a negative income tax giving
the most money to the poorest. Instead, most of Proposition 46's
benefits might go to the middle class, helping only a fraction of
those who need help.</LD>
<LD>   The government should build the housing itself. It could create
many jobs for the poor and unemployed, with job training and job
sharing. Under Proposition 46, a number of already-rich homebuilders
will wind up making millions because of inadequate competition and
lack of opportunity for others to enter the industry.</LD>
<TE>   Proposition 46 is financed by borrowing, which would result in
$2.6 billion of taxpayers' money going to interest.</TE>
<TE>   The amount of housing to be produced by Proposition 46 is woefully
inadequate. Millions more affordable homes and apartments are needed.
If we are ever to address this great need it should be obvious that
progressive taxes, not borrowing, will be vital. Only the federal
government can really levy these kinds of taxes, and so it is to that
level that we must ultimately look.</TE>

<HD>Don't Let Bush Agenda Destroy Our Deserts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration's anti-environmental agenda is hitting the
California desert even harder than The Times pointed out ("Dynamics
Changing in Battle for Desert," Oct. 28). As you noted, the Interior
Department's Bureau of Land Management proposes to reopen 50,000
acres of the fragile Algodones Dunes to off-road vehicle
thrill-riding.</LD>
<LD>   Not mentioned was that the BLM is bullying its sister agency, the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to reverse a previous scientific
decision that found the dune closure necessary to save rare plants
from extinction. Moreover, the Interior Department is readying new
rules to ease the granting of rights of way for highway construction
across federal public lands under an obscure 1866 mining law known as
Revised Statute 2477.</LD>
<LD>   Rural counties across the West are claiming thousands of remote
jeep trails and even wash bottoms as R.S. 2477 "highways" in order to
thwart wilderness designation or other conservation measures. In the
California desert, San Bernardino County claims thousands of miles of
these bogus highways, including 2,500 miles within the Mojave
National Preserve alone, and others in Death Valley National Park and
in designated and proposed federally protected wilderness areas. If
granted, these trails would become a spider web of new county roads,
crisscrossing millions of acres of national parks and wilderness.</LD>
<TE>   Congress can help stop the Bush administration's attack on the
desert by legislating permanent protection for some of the last
unprotected wilderness in the desert, as proposed in the California
Wild Heritage Act. In a state blessed with such beautiful landscapes,
we must safeguard our treasures for generations to come.</TE>

mining companies, ranchers, the military and motorized recreation.</TE>

<LD>I was so pleased to read that doctors can no longer be accountable
for suggesting marijuana use to patients when needed ("Medical Pot
Use Given a Boost," Oct. 30). I just finished a year of treatments
for breast cancer. While in chemotherapy treatment, nothing could
control my severe nausea and vomiting. I was prescribed the so-called
best prescription drug: Zofran. I even had it in IV form. After being
so weak from vomiting that I didn't have enough strength to crawl
back into bed, I tried marijuana following my fourth chemo treatment.
The symptoms were gone instantly. The marijuana was the only thing
that kept me symptom-free. It was a miracle drug for me. I don't
condone drug use, but feel that medical marijuana is better than the
very expensive and synthetic alternatives in many medical cases.</LD>

<HD>Israel Amir, 99; First Commander of Israeli Air Force</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Israel Amir, 99, the first commander of the Israeli air force, died
Friday of unspecified causes in a Tel Aviv hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Born Israel Zblodovsky in Russia in 1903, Amir immigrated in 1923
to what was then British-ruled Palestine.</LD>
<LD>   He soon joined the Hagana underground, the forerunner of the
Israeli army, and by 1942 was made head of its information
department, which later evolved into the Mossad and Shin Bet
intelligence agencies.</LD>
<TE>   Before Israel declared its independence and was attacked by Arab
armies in 1948, Amir was sent to Europe to recruit and train
thousands of young Jewish survivors of the Nazi Holocaust for combat
in the new state. On May 16, new Israeli Prime Minister David
Ben-Gurion named Amir to head the country's fledgling air force,
which consisted of eight secondhand planes and no airstrip.</TE>
<TE>   Amir held the post a mere 10 weeks, but built the air force into

<LD>Michalis Stasinopoulos, 99, a legal scholar who challenged Greece's
1967-74 military dictatorship and served as president after it
collapsed, died Thursday, according to the Athens News Agency, which
listed no place or specific cause of death.</LD>
<LD>   As head of the Council of State, Greece's highest legal panel,
Stasinopoulos declared military rule illegal. The junta leaders
ignored his ruling; nevertheless, the historic decision served as a
rallying point for resistance leaders.</LD>
<LD>   After a public referendum abolished Greece's monarchy and
established a presidential system of government in 1974,
Stasinopoulos was elected interim president.</LD>
<TE>   He left office the following year, when parliament selected his
successor.</TE>
<TE>   Stasinopoulos taught law at several universities in Greece. He
also served as ad hoc judge at the International Court of Justice at
The Hague from 1976 to 1978.</TE>

<HD>Raf Vallone, 86; Italian Soccer Player, Lawyer Turned Film
Star</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Raf Vallone, the ruggedly handsome soccer player, lawyer, reporter
and movie critic who became an international film star with the
classic "Bitter Rice" in the late 1940s, has died. He was 86.</LD>
<LD>   Vallone, who made films from Italy to Hollywood in Italian, French
and English, died Thursday in a hospital in Rome of unspecified
causes.</LD>
<LD>   Often compared to Burt Lancaster, the athletic Vallone proved as
popular with American audiences in the 1960s as he had with Italians
in the late 1940s and 1950s. Among his films that were well-received
in the U.S. were "Two Women" in 1960 and "El Cid" in 1961, both
co-starring Sophia Loren. He played Jean Harlow's stepfather in the
1965 "Harlow."</LD>
<TE>   Vallone delighted the bald director Otto Preminger by volunteering
to shave his thick dark crop of hair for a role as the bald cleric in
"The Cardinal" in 1963. Vallone also played memorable clerics in
Henry Hathaway's "Nevada Smith" in 1966 and Francis Ford Coppola's
"Godfather Part III" in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   But the American role that Vallone made his own was Eddie, the
Italian American dockworker obsessed with his niece in Arthur
Miller's "A View from the Bridge." After Vallone saw a London
production of the play, he sought and won the role as Eddie in the
Paris version, which ran for 550 performances.</TE>
<TE>   When Sidney Lumet filmed the play, Vallone easily won the screen
role in 1962 opposite Maureen Stapleton.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Loren and Stapleton, Vallone worked in his
half-century on film, TV and the stage with Silvana Mangano, Simone
Signoret, Gina Lollobrigida, Anna Magnani, Melina Mercouri and his
wife, Elena Varzi.</TE>
<TE>   Cast as leading man and in character parts, including villains,
Vallone was never considered for comedic roles. Yet he wanted to try
comedy, he told The Times in 1965 when he was in Los Angeles to film
"Harlow," with Carroll Baker.</TE>
<TE>   "To be an actor is to be someone who likes to express himself, to
integrate himself with his part," he said. "I [have] missed occasions
to transmit my joy, my optimism, about life. It is my particular
attitude to be generous, to look for the positive, in front of the
mistakes of other people ... my sympathy for the human being."</TE>
<TE>   Raffaele Vallone was born in Tropea in the Cambria section of
Italy; his father was a prominent lawyer, his mother an aristocrat.
He earned law and philosophy degrees at the University of Turin and
practiced law with his father, while playing semiprofessional soccer
and hoping to make a career of the sport.</TE>
<TE>   When that didn't happen, Vallone became a sports reporter for the
communist newspaper L'Unita and drama critic for the journal La
Stampa. He was also a member of the anti-Fascist resistance during
World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Although he had a bit part as a sailor in the 1942 "We the
Living," Vallone gave little thought to an acting career until
Giuseppe De Santis hired him a few years later to research "Bitter
Rice," which was about labor strife in the Po River valley. De
Santis, declaring Vallone "a natural," cast him as the soldier vying
with Vittorio Gassman for the affections of leading lady Mangano. The
neo-realist film made Vallone, by then in his early 30s, a worldwide
star and gave him a new career.</TE>
<TE>   Although he seemed to have no problems finding work on stages in
Rome, Paris, London and New York or in films in Europe and the U.S.,
in 1989, Vallone joined Gina Lollobrigida and other actors to protest
the increasing number of foreign performers hired for Italian films.</TE>
<TE>   Vallone, who is survived by his wife, a son and a daughter, said
three years ago that he was unconcerned with thoughts of death. "I am
not afraid of dying," he said. "I'm afraid of getting old."</TE>

<HD>Study Discounts Claims That Roller Coasters Can Cause Brain
Damage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Caitlin Liu and Kimi Yoshino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite some claims that roller coasters can cause brain damage, a
new study by University of Pennsylvania researchers is telling people
to relax and enjoy the ride.</LD>
<LD>   The study, published in the latest issue of the Journal of
Neurotrauma, discounts allegations that the high-speed twists and
turns associated with today's most thrilling coaster rides can be
hazardous to one's health.</LD>
<LD>   Using a mathematical model, neurosurgery professor Douglas H.
Smith and bioengineering professor David F. Meaney analyzed how a
rider's head might react to the gravitational forces experienced on a
roller coaster.</LD>
<TE>   They concluded that even the most rough-and-tumble rides would not
produce the levels of head acceleration needed to cause brain bleeds
or other serious trauma to a normal, healthy person.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to bring a little bit of balance to several shrill claims
that roller coasters cause brain injury," said Smith, who is working
on a follow-up study using humans. The controversy over thrill rides
and G-forces, he added, has been "blown out of proportion ... on a
scattered series of case reports that are anecdotal at best."</TE>
<TE>   The study, which was funded by the National Institutes of Health,
is adding more fuel to the debate over coaster safety during a time
of increasing governmental efforts to regulate amusement parks, as
well as litigation by people claiming to have been injured on a ride.</TE>
<TE>   There have been several cases of brain injury allegedly associated
with roller coasters in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   In June 2001, Pearl Santos, 28, suffered a ruptured aneurysm on
the Goliath roller coaster at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia.
The stress and strain of the ride may have contributed to her death,
a coroner's report stated.</TE>
<TE>   Santos' parents have sued the park's corporate owners, accusing
them of knowingly operating a dangerous ride and inadequately warning
patrons about its potential lethal hazards. The case is still
pending.</TE>
<TE>   Also last year, the Walt Disney Co. agreed to pay an undisclosed
sum to settle a lawsuit with Deborah Bynum, 46, who said she suffered
a brain hemorrhage while riding Disneyland's Indiana Jones ride.</TE>
<TE>   At the center of concerns of some doctors and government
regulators are the effects of G-forces on riders, how long the forces
last, how quickly and radically they change and whether a ride jolts
back and forth abruptly.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, New Jersey became the first state to regulate the
level of G-forces in roller coasters. Next year, Rep. Edward J.
Markey (D-Mass.) plans to reintroduce the Roller Coaster Safety Act,
which would allow the federal government to investigate serious
accidents at theme parks.</TE>
<TE>   Markey's office has compiled a list of at least 58 documented
brain injury cases associated with roller coaster rides, ranging from
preexisting aneurysms and brain hemorrhages to lesser incidents that
resulted in headaches, nausea and vision problems. Eight cases were
fatal.</TE>
<TE>   The congressman also has asked the Brain Injury Assn. of America
to convene a panel of experts, including Meaney, to review existing
scientific literature and other documented medical cases.</TE>
<TE>   The group is expected to present its findings next year. In the
meantime, the University of Pennsylvania research is being lauded by
roller coaster enthusiasts and the amusement park industry.</TE>
<TE>   "Science bears out the impeccable safety of our parks and our
rides," said Bill Powers, spokesman for the International Assn. of
Amusement Parks and Attractions. But others say the study falls
short.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't explain why we're seeing a rise in the injuries," said
Robert Braksiek, an emergency room physician in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
Braksiek wrote an earlier study, published in the Annals of Emergency
Medicine, that found roller coaster riders face a small but real risk
of brain injury caused by sudden stops and starts and directional
changes.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Novack, a Beverly Hills attorney who has filed six brain
injury lawsuits against amusement parks, said the mathematical model
using G-force data fails to simulate what real riders go through as
they are tossed about like a "shaken baby" during a coaster ride.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the acceleration, but the rapid change in acceleration
that causes vessels to tear," Novack said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith countered that his study is all about changes in
acceleration, and takes into account directional changes of a roller
coaster that can cause a rider's head to whip around.</TE>
<TE>   A recent review conducted by a separate panel of medical and
scientific experts for Six Flags Inc., which operates 39 amusement
parks worldwide, has concluded that there is no evidence of any
causal relationship between roller coasters' G-forces and brain
injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more likely that these things happen by chance and that the
roller coaster isn't causing the problem," said Robert Harbaugh,
professor of neurosurgery at Dartmouth Medical School and director of
Neuro-Knowledge, a collaboration between the American Assn. of
Neurological Surgeons and the for-profit group Outcome Sciences,
which conducted the study for Six Flags.</TE>
<TE>   The company has not yet publicly released its study. Coaster
enthusiasts say the most recent research merely corroborates what
they knew all along, and that they would continue enjoying the rush
of scream machines no matter what various studies say.</TE>
<TE>   "My gut feeling is that they've got to be safe," said Lisa
Scheinin of Redondo Beach, who has ridden nearly 800 roller coasters
around the world. "Look at how many millions of people go to
amusement parks every year. How many of them have a problem?"</TE>

<HD>Mud Flies Faster as Voters' Disgust Becomes Simon's Only
Hope</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>George Skelton</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>It's down to this for Bill Simon Jr.: His only hope of being elected
governor is if Democrats so abhor Gov. Gray Davis they cannot stomach
voting for him.</LD>
<LD>   Too calculating. Too corrupt.</LD>
<LD>   Democrats don't even have to vote for Simon. Just stiff Davis.</LD>
<TE>   So Simon, in weekend TV ads, began chucking even more muck at the
incumbent, dredging up a 16-year-old charge that then-Assemblyman
Davis illegally used legislative aides and phones to raise money for
his controller race. Davis was not prosecuted by Atty. Gen. John Van
de Kamp, a fellow Democrat, but he repaid the Assembly $28,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Had enough?" the Simon ad asks. "Fire Gray Davis."</TE>
<TE>   "No namby-pamby, fluffy stuff," says a Simon advisor, one of
several who had been pushing him to run tough attack ads. Simon
wanted to run positive, issues spots, but acquiesced.</TE>
<TE>   No. 1 strategist Ed Rollins explained to Simon he had been
discredited -- by Davis' bombardment of attack ads and his own
stumbling -- and simply was not believable to voters.</TE>
<TE>   "He's so badly bruised," Rollins says, "he can only make charges
against Gray Davis because people already believe them."</TE>
<TE>   The novice candidate, who had never run for office before, also
has been told by advisors to forget about ever running again if he
doesn't win Tuesday. He's too damaged. Better pour it on now.</TE>
<TE>   This reportedly shocked Simon, who had envisioned a political
future even if he loses.</TE>
<TE>   That might have been possible if he'd lost the primary, finishing
a respectable second, and the winner had been drubbed in November.
But Simon now has been pummeled for eight months -- by Davis and by
himself. His only lifeline is to pull an upset Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   In truth, only one or two advisors -- including original
strategist Sal Russo -- profess to believe Simon will win. Others,
however, haven't abandoned hope. It's very eerie out there among the
tuned-out electorate. Anything's possible.</TE>
<TE>   But for Simon to triumph, Republicans must hold their noses and
vote for a conservative who's uninspiring, inexperienced and inept.
And that's hardly a sure bet.</TE>
<TE>   Neutral polls consistently have shown that Republicans like Simon
no better than Democrats like Davis -- in fact, less.</TE>
<TE>   The latest Field poll found that 62% of Davis' supporters are
voting "for" the governor, in contrast to merely "against" Simon. But
of Simon's supporters, only 32% are voting "for" the GOP candidate.</TE>
<TE>   In the Times Poll -- which showed Davis 9 points ahead -- each
candidate is drawing about three-fourths of his party's vote.</TE>
<TE>   Also helping Davis, final voter registration figures show that
Democrats outnumber Republicans by 44.6% to 35.2%, with
declined-to-states at 15.2%. The independents favor Davis by 28
points, the Times Poll found.</TE>
<TE>   So Simon's negative ads are aimed at firing up Republicans and
depressing everyone else -- by fueling the GOP's hatred of Davis
while making him repulsive to Democrats and independents. It's now
too late to sell Simon, his strategists figure.</TE>
<TE>   How did it get to this?</TE>
<TE>   Any reasonable Republican -- some warm body -- could have run
better against the unpopular Davis. Examples: insurance commissioner
candidate Gary Mendoza, a former state corporations commissioner;
lieutenant governor candidate Bruce McPherson, a longtime legislator.
Both are social moderates.</TE>
<TE>   But here's what Mendoza and McPherson don't have: Simon's
inherited millions. Wealth seduced the investor into arrogantly
believing he could master the big leagues without ever having played
rookie ball.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's first mistake was running. He should have stuck with his
original instinct to go for state treasurer.</TE>
<TE>   Another mistake was not realizing that his primary election
victory was a fluke. Davis beat up front-runner Richard Riordan --
the Republican he feared -- and Riordan also imploded.</TE>
<TE>   If Simon had understood this, he might have poured millions of his
own stash into a post-primary TV effort to introduce himself to swing
voters. Instead, he waited and Davis defined him as a corporate
crook.</TE>
<TE>   Then there were the unending campaign screw-ups: not releasing his
taxes and not articulating why, not preparing politically for a
disastrous court judgment, leveling a bum rap against Davis on
fund-raising, making a gay rights commitment and reneging. Allowing
his staff to bicker and backstab. Being unfocused on issues. Lacking
passion.</TE>
<TE>   As I wrote earlier, it's hard to recall a worse candidate ever --
a worse nominee for California governor. Or a worse campaign.</TE>
<TE>   But, hey, Davis hasn't won yet. If he loses, he'll be the all-time
worst.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' hope is that Democrats see Simon as scary -- on labor,
guns, abortion, the environment -- and believe the Republican
possibly could win. Then suck it up and vote Democratic.</TE>

refurbish the units and sprawling grounds that were formerly at the
heart of a battle between a developer and tenants.</LD>
<LD>   Boards placed on the windows of vacant units by the former owner,
Legacy Partners, have been removed. The wooden letters that spell out
"Chase Knolls" have been reinstalled on the office. A full-time
landscaping crew is tending to the grounds, and apartments are being
painted in anticipation of new tenants.</LD>
<LD>   "In the first 48 hours after the regime changed, it was a bustle
of activity," said Susan Jagiello, who helped organize residents to
save the 13-acre complex on Riverside Drive, east of Notre Dame High
School. "They've made all the right moves and have reached out to the
residents. After a 2 1/2-year hiatus, it's nice to see things
happening."</LD>
<TE>   The battle over Chase Knolls began after Legacy purchased the
complex in January 2000, intending to replace the working-class
garden apartments and bungalows with a 402-unit luxury apartment
building, including 40 units of affordable housing for seniors.
Instead of taking money from Legacy to move, residents of 80 units
stayed put, determined to maintain the original complex.</TE>
<TE>   The desire to save Chase Knolls galvanized the residents, who
fought for and eventually won historic cultural monument status from
the Los Angeles City Council in July 2000, even though the city's
Cultural Heritage Commission deadlocked twice on the issue. The
complex, an example of the Garden City movement in urban design, was
built in 1949 to provide families with affordable housing surrounding
large courtyards of green lawns and trees.</TE>
<TE>   "The chief goal of Chase Knolls was building a sense of community.
That is why we survived, because we are a community," said Jagiello,
a freelance textbook editor who has lived at Chase Knolls for 15
years. "This proves it works."</TE>
<TE>   While the monument status doesn't provide total protection from
the wrecking ball, it requires the property owner to complete an
environmental impact report before demolishing anything. Such a
report hasn't materialized. Instead, Legacy sold the property in
mid-August to Knolls Associates for an undisclosed amount.</TE>
<TE>   Sue Gold, manager of Chase Knolls, said the new owner wants to
rent out the approximately 160 vacant units and has no plans to tear
down the complex. Ten apartments are being prepared at a time, and
there is a short waiting list, she said. One-bedroom units rent for
about $1,020 a month, two-bedroom units for about $1,200, with
bungalows going for about $75 more.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just going to lease apartments. We're not developers," said
Ernie Mieger, president of EDM Realty Corp. in San Francisco, the
property manager. "We're not planning to kick anybody out. We don't
do that."</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Cavallari, senior vice president with Irvine-based Legacy
Partners, said after the complex was given historic status his
company decided not to demolish the property but to renovate it to
take advantage of special tax credits. But when the company had
difficulty with financing, a major financial partner "directed us to
sell the property."</TE>
<TE>   Before selling Chase Knolls, Legacy entered into a Mills Act
contract with the city, which requires the current owner to preserve
the most significant features of a historic piece of the property,
said Kenneth Bernstein, director of preservation issues for the Los
Angeles Conservancy.</TE>
<TE>   The 10-year contract, which gives the owner a property tax
reduction, carries stiff penalties if it is breached.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a true win-win preservation story," Bernstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Although she is appreciative of the recent improvements, nine-year
Chase Knolls resident Mary Jane Atkins said she is anxious to meet
with the new owner.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm cautiously optimistic," said Atkins, a community college
English teacher. "You have to understand that we've just been through
a war. I trust [the new owners] will be fine with everything. Once
they meet with the residents and tell us their plans, we'll feel
better."</TE>

<DH>Pelican Bay inmates protest policy that sends reputed gang
members to segregation units.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jenifer Warren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A group of inmates is entering the third week of a hunger strike at
Pelican Bay State Prison, hoping to force corrections officials to
change how they identify and punish gang members in California's
sprawling penal system.</LD>
<LD>   About 60 inmates at the remote prison in Del Norte County near the
Oregon border began refusing their meals Oct. 19, officials say. A
few are continuing the strike and are declining to be weighed or
examined by physicians.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers for the inmates say they are protesting the Department of
Corrections' practice of isolating prisoners believed to be gang
members in harsh segregation units, where they are denied most
privileges and are rarely let out of their windowless cells.</LD>
<TE>   Prison officials said they are monitoring the striking inmates
carefully but have no plans to alter their policy. In January,
however, they intend to launch an already scheduled review of the
1,154 inmates confined in isolation at Pelican Bay to determine
whether any were sent there erroneously.</TE>
<TE>   The department's gang policy has long been a target of inmate
grievances, and last year sparked a hunger strike that involved about
1,000 convicts at Pelican Bay and a second prison.</TE>
<TE>   Under state regulations, male convicts determined to be gang
members or associates may be sent to a security housing unit at
Pelican Bay or at prisons in Corcoran and Tehachapi.</TE>
<TE>   Their term of isolation in the unit is indefinite, and the only
routes out are to be released on parole, to inform on other gang
members through an elaborate debriefing process or to demonstrate no
evidence of gang activity for six years.</TE>
<TE>   Prison officials say confining the most active gang members in the
unit helps curb violence within its systemwide population of 159,000.
Gang conflicts account for about 75% of the violence at the state's
33 lockups, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "We have 900 gangs or splinter groups in our system," said Stephen
Green, assistant secretary of the Youth and Adult Correctional
Agency, which oversees the Department of Corrections. "By removing
the shot-callers, we can limit the growth of the gangs and the
problems they cause."</TE>
<TE>   But inmates and their advocates say that officials sometimes
mistakenly label prisoners as gang members, in some cases on the
basis of other convicts' self-serving, confidential information.</TE>
<TE>   They want the state to change its policy to require that only an
inmate who engages in overt gang-related misconduct be labeled a
member and punished with an indefinite term in a security housing
unit.</TE>
<TE>   "The way it is now, you don't actually have to do anything wrong
... you just have to associate with the wrong people," said Charles
Carbone, a San Francisco attorney aiding the hunger strikers.</TE>
<TE>   Carbone said inmates have been tagged with the gang label and sent
to security housing after talking to a gang member in the law
library, signing a get-well card for a member or drawing Aztec
cultural symbols seen by authorities as proof of affiliation with the
Mexican Mafia.</TE>
<TE>   More troubling, critics argue, is the open-ended nature of an
inmate's stay in security housing once he is sent there. Some
prisoners choose to debrief, which involves informing on other
inmates through a series of interviews during a four-month program in
a special housing unit.</TE>
<TE>   But there is a substantial list of inmates who wish to debrief,
causing waits that have been as long as two years. And some inmates
are reluctant to debrief because of fear of retaliation against
themselves or their families by gang leaders -- or because they are,
in fact, not gang members and have no information to share.</TE>
<TE>   The option of earning release from security housing by serving six
years with no evidence of gang activity is difficult, inmates say,
because of snitching by other inmates and because sometimes innocent
behavior is taken as proof of continued affiliation with a gang.</TE>
<TE>   Once you are in the unit, "it is very, very difficult to get out,"
said Jesus Enriquez of La Puente, whose son-in-law has been confined
at Pelican Bay's security housing unit for 11 years. "They take the
smallest thing as evidence you are still part of the gang."</TE>
<TE>   Corrections officials defended their gang identification program
and said that only the "worst of the worst" are sent to security
housing. Inmates are determined to be gang members or associates only
with the support of three independent pieces of evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence may include tattoos, written material, photographs with
other gang members, incriminating letters or visitors, or debriefing
information from other inmates. If the evidence comes from a
confidential source, it must meet a strict test of reliability, said
Margot Bach, spokeswoman for the Department of Corrections.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a process that is done lightly, because we understand
that, when someone is validated as a gang member, it means
confinement ... for an indeterminate amount of time" in the unit,
Bach said.</TE>
<TE>   Once in the unit, California prisoners live under what all sides
agree are conditions of maximum deprivation and minimum privilege.</TE>
<TE>   At Pelican Bay, the 1,154 unit inmates spend about 23 hours a day
in 8-by-10-foot cells, released only to exercise daily and to shower
three times a week. Contact with other inmates and guards is almost
nonexistent. The doors are opened by remote control and meals are
pushed through slots in the wall.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1995 decision slamming the prison and a pattern of brutality
there, a federal judge said conditions in the unit "hover on the edge
of what is humanly tolerable."</TE>
<TE>   Given that, the inmates' concerns about being mislabeled as gang
members -- or being unable to prove their disassociation easily --
should not be taken lightly, said Craig Haney, a psychology professor
at UC Santa Cruz who has studied prisons for 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   "These are not inmates complaining about not getting their
magazines on time," said Haney. "They are living a very, very painful
and potentially destructive existence, and in some cases, they are
there for reasons that no longer apply to them."</TE>
<TE>   Haney called California's gang policy "wrongheaded" for several
reasons. He said that isolating gang members in the unit, which is
devoid of any employment opportunities or other programs to occupy
inmates' time, paradoxically may make them more prone to gang
activity. He added that many inmates are released directly from the
harsh isolation of the unit onto parole, with scant preparation for
the transition back into society.</TE>
<TE>   The hunger strike at Pelican Bay is being led by Steven Castillo,
a unit inmate convicted of first-degree murder who is challenging the
state's assertion that he is a member of the Mexican Mafia.</TE>
<TE>   Carbone said Castillo and the other striking inmates are
subsisting on Kool-Aid and water, but prison officials said the
convicts are eating food stockpiled from the canteen.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo also led last year's hunger strike, which lasted six days
and was suspended after state Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles)
intervened and vowed to help broker a resolution.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next year, Polanco convened several meetings involving
corrections officials and advocates for the inmates. Haney said
department officials seemed open to making changes but never followed
through.</TE>
<TE>   Department officials said they never agreed to any changes.</TE>
<TE>   At a meeting last week, also called by Polanco, they would not
commit to any policy shift but said they would be reviewing the cases
of the unit inmates at Pelican Bay, a process expected to take a
year.</TE>

<HD>Diocese in O.C. Awash in Red Ink</HD>
<DH>Bishop reports losing $14 million for second straight year.
Budget cuts are ordered.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Lobdell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange has lost more than $14 million
for a second straight year, in part because of losses in the stock
market, and is ordering a second round of 5% budget cuts, church
officials announced Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The back-to-back losses are the first in the diocese's 27-year
history. Three years ago, it reported a surplus of $21.5 million,
thanks largely to a windfall from stock investments.</LD>
<LD>   Bishop of Orange Tod D. Brown, who released the report on the
2001-02 fiscal year to worshipers at Sunday services, said the losses
over the last two years have been caused by a variety of factors:
besides a sagging stock market, an unexpected rise in insurance
costs, $12 million spent on critical needs at poor parishes, and $3.6
million to settle molestation claims.</LD>
<TE>   To help cope with the decline, Brown in July had ordered
department heads to reduce expenses 5%, and he asked for another 5%
reduction last week. Combined, the cuts will bring back $1 million to
the bottom line, officials said. To date, about a dozen jobs have
been frozen or eliminated, with two employees laid off.</TE>
<TE>   The report did contain a silver lining: The church's molestation
scandals don't appear to have hurt giving by parishioners. Philip J.
Reis, director of finance for the Orange diocese, said revenue from
the churches' collections was up nearly 5% from the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   The public airing of finances contrasts in style, if not
substance, with the much larger Archdiocese of Los Angeles. Church
officials in Los Angeles have not publicly released figures for even
the previous fiscal year, which are now eight months overdue.</TE>
<TE>   The four-page financial report given to Orange County Catholics
included articles, color graphs, financial tables, charts and a note
on where to find the complete audited statement.</TE>
<TE>   The losses in Orange of more than $28 million over the last two
years have depleted nearly two-thirds of available reserves. The
diocese does have an additional $90.6 million in reserves designated
for specific purposes. Stock market declines have lowered the value
of the diocesan investment portfolio from $227 million three years
ago to about $182 million by the end of September.</TE>
<TE>   The Catholic Church's molestation scandal and the poor economic
climate have again delayed the diocese's ambitious $100-million
capital campaign to raise money for, among other things, a new parish
and cathedral in Santa Ana and retirement housing for priests. The
campaign was first announced more than two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   For Brown, who oversees a rapidly growing flock that now numbers
about 1 million, the financial troubles are vexing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tremendously frustrating," he said. "[But] it makes me more
reliant on God. God, in time, will provide the funds we need to
continue our mission. I'm not concerned about that. But I might not
like the timing."</TE>
<TE>   Brown said he feels compelled to publicly disseminate the
financial information, a practice he started three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "People give money for specific causes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We should try to let people know how the money is spent and where
it goes," he continued. "I think that kind of information makes
people have a certain comfort level."</TE>
<TE>   The bishop also presented the news at diocesan headquarters last
week for priests, laity and others.</TE>
<TE>   Father Bill Barman, pastor of Our Lady of La Vang in Santa Ana,
said he was especially pleased that the bishop invited lay members of
each parish finance council.</TE>
<TE>   "They asked the majority of questions," Barman said. "It was a
very peaceful meeting, and a brilliant move. It makes the finances a
nonissue. There was no subterfuge."</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, officials have declined to publicly release their
2000-01 report -- scheduled for publication last March in the
Tidings, the archdiocesan newspaper -- or answer basic questions
about church finances.</TE>
<TE>   "Rapidly changing financial conditions and subsequent events
related to the sexual-abuse crisis in the spring of 2002 made the
publication of financial results from June 30, 2001, not relevant to
current conditions," church officials said in a prepared statement
released to The Times on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Church officials did say that the report for the fiscal year
ending in June of this year will be published in the Tidings early
next year, ahead of the usual March or April deadline, and will
contain information from the unreleased 2000-01 report. Financial
reporting for the archdiocese always lags behind Orange because of
budget complexities brought on by size and different accounting
methods, church officials said. The archdiocese serves 5 million
parishioners, about five times as many as Orange.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese is in the middle of a budget crisis that led in
September to the surprise elimination of seven church ministries,
retrenchment in others and layoffs of at least 60 workers one week
after the opening of the $189-million Cathedral of Our Lady of the
Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the archdiocese said a draft of their audited
report will be presented to the church's finance council this month.
That will be followed in January with informational meetings for
pastors and parish finance council members before the report is
finally published in the Tidings.</TE>
<TE>   "Until that process is complete we are not able to comment on or
release financial information for the fiscal year ending June 30,
2002," church officials said.</TE>
<TE>   As for the previous fiscal year, pastors and finance council
members were given presentations on the budget in January and
February, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to declaring the financial information from the
2000-01 report "not relevant to current conditions," church leaders
said that by March "all available staff resources were dedicated to
the sexual abuse crisis matters and the upcoming
completion/dedication of the new cathedral," making it difficult to
publicize the financial report.</TE>

<HD>Oxnard Boy, 15, Shot to Death Outside Home</HD>
<DH>The Hueneme High student's slaying is the city's third in
recent weeks. Police say the youth had no known links to gangs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Kelly</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Oxnard high school sophomore with no apparent gang ties was gunned
down outside his home late Saturday in a crime that shocked neighbors
and left police scrambling for clues.</LD>
<LD>   Steven Miinster, 15, was standing beside a wall bordering his
backyard about 11 p.m. when he was shot once in the torso, police
said. He was rushed to St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard
and pronounced dead half an hour later.</LD>
<LD>   "This is one of the younger homicides we have had," said Oxnard
Police Cmdr. John Chronister, "You don't know if this was a random
act or if someone was out there just shooting. We really don't know
much at this point."</LD>
<TE>   While police said they had no real leads, neighbors in the tough
south Oxnard community said Sunday that Steven was in bed sleeping
Saturday when he got a call from a girl who asked to meet him
outside.</TE>
<TE>   He left his home, walked a few feet around the corner and was
shot, said a neighbor who requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard police said they have no information about such a call.</TE>
<TE>   Police and neighbors said the lanky Hueneme High School student
had no known gang affiliations.</TE>
<TE>   The slaying is the 11th in Oxnard this year and the third in
recent weeks. Two men, a Navy reservist and a fast-food worker, were
shot and killed last month. The reservist's death may be tied to gang
hostilities, police said.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, friends and family in Steven Miinster's working class
neighborhood near Saviers Road gathered near the spot where he was
shot and tried to make sense of the violence.</TE>
<TE>   The victim's 7-year-old sister, Erica, stared silently at the
blood-stained sidewalk. Balloons, candles and a huge card saying,
"We'll miss you Steven" were placed against the orange wall.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard the gunshot; around here you hear gunshots all the
time," said Maria Miinster, the boy's mother, who has five other
children. "I came out and saw him laying on the sidewalk. I don't
know why he was outside. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
There is a lot of gang activity around here."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday was a big day for Steven, his mother said. He cashed his
first check from his new clerical job in the high school office. His
mom drove him to the bank, and when he got his money, he promptly
gave some to her.</TE>
<TE>   "He gave us money when he had it. He was trying really hard,
trying not to go the wrong way," she said. "He was always home. He
didn't drink or take drugs, nothing like that. Everybody liked him --
teachers, friends."</TE>
<TE>   The family, longtime Oxnard residents, had only lived in their
nondescript one-story tract home near Bryce Canyon Avenue and B
Street for a year, and now may move.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel safe anymore," Miinster said.</TE>
<TE>   The slaying hit the neighborhood hard, leaving dozens of mourners
red-eyed and somber. People wandered past the makeshift memorial,
lingering for a moment to read or write an inscription.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard about it and I thought, 'Not him' " said 15-year-old
Violet Lerma, the teen's cousin. "Why him? He was such a nice
person."</TE>
<TE>   One person wrote: "Don't 4get that you were my 1st true friend
like a brother to me.... I'll always love and I'll never forget about
you."</TE>
<TE>   An uncle said Steven wrote rap songs and attended church.</TE>
<TE>   The boy's aunt, Juanita Suniga, 52, works with special needs
children at Hueneme High School and remembered how he greeted her
around school.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd give me a kiss no matter who else was watching," she said.
"He always had a smile on his face. He was always happy."</TE>
<TE>   Philip Gastelum, 41, a family friend who had known Steven since he
was 2 months old, shook his head as he placed balloons on the wall.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe it just happened," he said. "I don't know why
they would shoot him. He was only 15 years old."</TE>

<HD>Activists Hope to Bar Redding Fluoridation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Emily Gurnon</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the latest in a series of emotionally charged battles throughout
California over water fluoridation, voters in Redding will decide
Tuesday whether to prohibit the addition of the chemical compound to
their water system.</LD>
<LD>   On one side of the argument is the medical and dental
establishment in this city of 85,000, including its two major
hospitals, its large community health center and a number of
prominent dentists and pediatricians. Fluoridation is an essential
tool in preventing tooth decay for all ages and socioeconomic levels,
they argue.</LD>
<LD>   On the other side is a small but vocal group of activists whose
rallying cry is, "Don't mess with our drinking water."</LD>
<TE>   "I don't like anybody telling me what to eat and drink," said
Betty Doty, a family counselor and a Redding resident for 50 years.
She said most people who promote the measure want "the right of
choice" over whether to drink fluoridated water.</TE>
<TE>   Measure A, put on the ballot through a citizens initiative, would
prohibit the addition of "any substance or chemical for the purpose
of treating the physical or mental functions of any person" unless
the chemical is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
The FDA has no jurisdiction over water quality issues.</TE>
<TE>   The measure does not specifically mention fluoride.</TE>
<TE>   But the initiative drive was prompted by a City Council decision
last year to approve fluoridation, pending an examination of the
costs. A 1995 state law requires fluoridation in communities with at
least 10,000 water connections if money is available from sources
other than taxpayers or water system bondholders.</TE>
<TE>   The California Department of Health Services is not campaigning
against the anti-fluoridation measure, said Dr. Kathleen Acree, the
agency's chief of chronic disease control.</TE>
<TE>   But, she added, "the state Legislature has expressed its intent
that fluoridation is a good thing and ought to be done in California,
particularly since we are one of the lowest-ranking states" in terms
of how many people drink fluoridated water.</TE>
<TE>   However, Michel Czehatowski, a Redding acupuncturist and herb
store owner who is leading the anti-fluoride campaign, complained
that "all of a sudden there was a vote, with virtually no public
discussion" about whether fluoridation was wise.</TE>
<TE>   Dean Germano, chief executive officer of the Shasta Community
Health Center and leader of the pro-fluoride group, said those
pushing for Measure A use fear as their best tool.</TE>
<TE>   "They know they can't win on the science, but what they do is
bring up a laundry list of scare tactics: Alzheimer's, cancer,
brittle-bone disease," Germano said. "What you want to do in an
election is just put a little doubt out there." He said polls show
pro-fluoride sentiment holding a slight edge.</TE>
<TE>   Fluoride started being added to community water systems in the
United States in 1945. Nationwide, about two-thirds of the population
lives in areas where the water is fluoridated. Forty-two of the 50
largest cities, including Los Angeles, Washington D.C., New York and
San Francisco, are fluoridated.</TE>
<TE>   California is far behind the rest of the country in fluoridation
rates; only about one-third of the state's population has fluoridated
water.</TE>
<TE>   Redding, 160 miles north of Sacramento, has never had it.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of fluoride point to its widespread use as proof that
it is safe.</TE>
<TE>   "After 50 years, 150 [million] or 160 million people routinely
using fluoridated water -- where are the bodies?" Germano said.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-fluoride efforts in Redding and other California cities
have been led by, or greatly assisted by, a San Diego-based group
called Citizens for Safe Drinking Water.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Green, the group's director, said the Redding initiative is
not about fluoride, though that is the focus of fliers being
circulated there. The fluoride compound the city would use,
fluorosilicic acid, is a "hazardous waste" with contaminants such as
arsenic that would have to be removed, Green said.</TE>
<TE>   He said fluoride has been linked to hip fractures and lead
poisoning in children, among other things. "There seems to be plenty
of evidence out there, but [the media] are not reporting it."</TE>
<TE>   Germano called such conclusions "junk science fed by the
Internet."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. David F. Nelson, a fluoridation consultant with the state
Health Services Department, said the amount of arsenic sometimes
present in fluorosilicic acid is minuscule -- "way, way, way below
the standard allowed" -- and presents no danger.</TE>
<TE>   The fluoride feud has made its way to other California cities.
Last year, Modesto voters said no to fluoridation. Santa Cruz voted
against it in 1999. The City Council in Santa Barbara rejected it the
same year. This year, a measure is on the ballot in Watsonville, just
south of Santa Cruz.</TE>
<TE>   What may be lost in the imbroglio is the reason for fluoridation:
the state of Redding residents' teeth.</TE>
<TE>   Water fluoridation reduces cavities as much as 60% in children and
nearly 35% in adults, according to the American Dental Assn. And it
is cheap; the additive would cost Redding residents an estimated
$1.08 a month per hookup.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's tantamount to reducing the amount of decay present,"
said Dr. Gus Petras, a pediatric dentist who has been practicing for
26 years in Redding.</TE>

<HD>Hollywood Mass Choir Sings Its Way to a First at Gospelfest</HD>
<DH>The year-old amateur group is a surprise winner in the
event's adult category.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Hollywood Mass Choir, a 40-member ensemble led by a Los Angeles
County public defender, won the adult category of the 18th annual
Gospelfest at the Shrine Auditorium on Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   The ceremony marked the culmination of a five-month series of
competitions to recognize the best amateur vocal groups from Los
Angeles, Orange, Ventura, Riverside and San Bernardino counties.</LD>
<LD>   Winners in adult choir, youth choir and group categories receive
trophies; their participation in perhaps the premier gospel music
event in Southern California is considered a mark of honor.</LD>
<TE>   The Hollywood choir, together only a year, was somewhat a surprise
winner in the adult category. Under director Patrick Hare, the group
comprises a range of cultures, religious denominations and ages, and
many of its members have little or no musical background. "It's a
thrill to be in such a company of wonderful, loving musicians," Hare
said after the win. "Everyone has just thrown their arms around us
and welcomed us in an incredible way."</TE>
<TE>   Other finalists in the adult category were the Voices of Zion, the
Robert Taylor II Community Mass Choir, Jubilant Voices of Holman and
the Mary Lind Foundation Choir. In the youth category, winners were
the Voices of Gospel Youth Choir and the Youth Choir of First
AME-Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   On Achord won in the group category. Proceeds from this year's
Gospelfest, sponsored by McDonald's, benefit the Ronald McDonald
House charities and the African-American Future Achievers Scholarship
program, which gives college scholarships.</TE>

<HD>Voters to Say Grow or No Grow</HD>
<DH>More homes or more open space is the question facing many
communities at the ballot box on Tuesday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jenifer Ragland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California voters on Tuesday will consider a diverse set of growth
initiatives in a ballot-box war between anti-sprawl activists and
real estate interests. They will decide two dozen local measures in
coastal communities and small farm towns around the state.</LD>
<LD>   From Alameda to Escondido, activists are campaigning to keep
tracts of open space from being subdivided. Using ballot initiatives,
they are trying to preserve untouched hillsides, put caps on the
number of building permits issued and prevent construction of
individual housing projects.</LD>
<LD>   In response, home builders are spending heavily to promote their
own visions of California's future: the construction of new
master-planned communities to address a statewide housing shortage.</LD>
<TE>   Overall, it's a Nov. 5 grow-or-not potpourri:</TE>
<TE>   There's an old-fashioned property-rights battle in rural Nevada
County, a question of building heights in bustling Berkeley and a
proposed resolution to a long fight over farmland in Watsonville.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, Ventura County leads the way with costly
and controversial ballot measures that could define the boundaries of
growth in three cities for decades to come.</TE>
<TE>   While the measures vary widely, the underlying issue is the same,
said Paul Shigley, managing editor of California Planning and
Development Report, a monthly newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about grappling with the 500,000 new people California
adds every year," he said. "The question is, 'How are we going to
deal with that?' "</TE>
<TE>   For the last decade, Ventura County -- a national pacesetter for
growth control -- has let voters answer that question.</TE>
<TE>   "Ventura County loves to vote on this stuff," Shigley said. "It's
become part of the political landscape."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1995, every major city in the semi-rural suburban county has
passed its own anti-sprawl law, requiring voter approval before
projects can be built on farmland, open space or beyond set urban
boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   This fall, voters are seeing a backlash by landowners and
developers. In Ventura and Santa Paula, where hot markets have nearly
doubled housing prices, development interests have spent between
$750,000 and $1 million sponsoring initiatives that would allow 1,390
and 2,200 new homes respectively to be built in scrubby canyons and
on brush-covered hillsides.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Ventura County has produced a second generation
of growth-control measures that would further shrink the boundaries
for urban expansion. That's happening in Simi Valley, a fast-growing
commuter enclave near the San Fernando Valley. If activists win, the
vote would effectively block two major housing projects pending
before the city.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Ventura and Santa Paula measures pass that would send an
encouraging signal to developers," said author William Fulton, who
heads a planning think tank in Ventura. "That is: A political
campaign is a big hassle, but it's not as big a hassle as going
through the City Council first."</TE>
<TE>   If the Simi Valley measure passes, Shigley said, it's possible
that growth-control activists will follow suit in other cities,
trying to shrink urban boundaries just a few years after voters
approved the first set. "I could see them trying the same thing in
Oxnard, Camarillo and even Ventura," Shigley said.</TE>
<TE>   In Northern California, on the east side of the San Francisco Bay,
Alameda County is Ventura's growth-control counterpart. There, half a
dozen ballot measures focus on stopping construction on vacant land
one parcel at a time.</TE>
<TE>   "People are looking to Manhattan-ize the Bay Area," said Jean
Sweeney, chair of Alameda Open Space. "My attitude is we ought to put
a cap on the number of people who can live here."</TE>
<TE>   Farther inland, communities struggling to keep their small-town
feel are considering growth caps.</TE>
<TE>   Halfway between Stockton and Sacramento, in the heart of the Delta
Recreation Area, the city of Galt is one of the Central Valley's
fastest growing communities. Residents worried that Galt could become
the next Elk Grove -- a burgeoning Sacramento suburb --want home
building limited to 300 units a year.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents argue that the restriction would force developers to
build out of town, robbing the city of tax revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, voters in Windsor -- a small town nestled in the
Russian River grape-growing region of Sonoma County -- could tighten
a cap on housing permits they adopted in 1997. Like other communities
in Sonoma and Napa counties, the pioneers of California's slow-growth
movement, Windsor has a growth boundary. But the initiative would
determine how fast homes get built inside that urban limit line to
ensure that roads, sewers and schools can keep pace, supporters say.</TE>
<TE>   Such fights over growth may only distract Californians from
important regional planning efforts, says Gerald Raycraft, planning
director of the Assn. of Bay Area Governments, a council of nine
counties and 101 cities. The group last month unveiled a
"smart-growth" plan for the Bay Area -- a 20-year vision to limit
sprawl, provide affordable housing and preserve open space. It was
less than enthusiastically received.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy to say 'more people' is the problem," Raycraft said.
"Ballot-box planning tends to be a simplistic approach to fixing
something that's more complex."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Detweiler, a consultant to the state Senate Local Government
Committee, attributes the trend to an absence of leadership at the
state level. "As a result, the wider debate -- what kind of
California should exist in the future -- has not been engaged for
years," said Detweiler, who has tracked such trends for 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Communities are left to bludgeon each other with the only legal
weapons they have in their grasp," he said. "That results in
unnecessarily caustic political debates that can divide friends,
communities and families."</TE>
<TE>   An example is unfolding in Nevada County in the foothills of the
Sierra Nevada. That county, a popular retreat for Sacramento and San
Francisco residents with weekend ranches and homes there, is center
stage for a heated battle over property rights that has caught
national attention.</TE>
<TE>   A ballot measure would create a streamlined process for
reimbursing landowners when county regulations prohibit full
development of their property. The debate has pitted a mix of
conservative property owners, retirees, farmers and environmentalists
against one another.</TE>
<TE>   Russ Steele, a 64-year-old retired Air Force pilot, said
restrictions imposed by the county's "liberal" Board of Supervisors
have slowly eroded basic property rights.</TE>
<TE>   "At stake is our personal freedom," Steele said. "The government
is supposed to be protecting us. It's not supposed to be stealing
from us."</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Izzy Martin, a 16-year resident who grows
organic vegetables, said the landowners' measure goes too far. She
cites a study that predicts a $5-million to $10-million drain each
year on county coffers.</TE>
<TE>   "It represents a huge opportunity for speculators to make windfall
profits out of the Nevada County general fund," Martin said.</TE>
<TE>   Election season is always "contact-sport time" in rural counties,
Martin said. But this time, she said, she has been compared to the
terrorists who destroyed the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   An Oregon initiative similar to the one in Nevada County was
struck down by the courts last month, but Steele believes his can
withstand legal challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is, this is [a] groundbreaking initiative," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That is why many planning experts across the state are keeping a
close eye on it. They're also watching another local measure that
could set a positive precedent.</TE>
<TE>   In the farm town of Watsonville, near Salinas, a ballot measure
represents a compromise between factions that have feuded over growth
for decades.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers, environmentalists, Latino leaders and business groups
have agreed on a plan that outlines specific areas for urban growth,
farming and open-space preservation, said Patrick McCormick, a state
planning agency officer in Santa Cruz County.</TE>
<TE>   After fighting an inconclusive annexation battle in 1999, the
warring groups formed their own nonprofit agency to plan the
community's future, McCormick said.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody was willing to give up something because they all liked
what they got," he said. "For communities in California who are at
loggerheads to resolve important public issues, it's potentially a
great model."</TE>

<TE>   Overall, it's a Nov. 5 grow-or-not potpourri:</TE>
<TE>   There's an old-fashioned property-rights battle in rural Nevada
County, a question of building heights in bustling Berkeley and a
proposed resolution to a long fight over farmland in Watsonville.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, Ventura County leads the way with costly
and controversial ballot measures that could define the boundaries of
growth in three cities for decades to come.</TE>
<TE>   While the measures vary widely, the underlying issue is the same,
said Paul Shigley, managing editor of California Planning and
Development Report, a monthly newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about grappling with the 500,000 new people California
adds every year," he said. "The question is, 'How are we going to
deal with that?' "</TE>
<TE>   For the last decade, Ventura County -- a national pacesetter for
growth control -- has let voters answer that question.</TE>
<TE>   "Ventura County loves to vote on this stuff," Shigley said. "It's
become part of the political landscape."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1995, every major city in the semi-rural suburban county has
passed its own anti-sprawl law, requiring voter approval before
projects can be built on farmland, open space or beyond set urban
boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   This fall, voters are seeing a backlash by landowners and
developers. In Ventura and Santa Paula, where hot markets have nearly
doubled housing prices, development interests have spent between
$750,000 and $1 million sponsoring initiatives that would allow 1,390
and 2,200 new homes respectively to be built in scrubby canyons and
on brush-covered hillsides.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Ventura County has produced a second generation
of growth-control measures that would further shrink the boundaries
for urban expansion. That's happening in Simi Valley, a fast-growing
commuter enclave near the San Fernando Valley. If activists win, the
vote would effectively block two major housing projects pending
before the city.</TE>
<TE>   In tiny Ojai, an artist and tourist town, a new measure would
prohibit the City Council from approving projects that significantly
increase traffic without voter consent.</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura County measures could set statewide trends for
so-called ballot-box planning.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Ventura and Santa Paula measures pass that would send an
encouraging signal to developers," said author William Fulton, who
heads a planning think tank in Ventura. "That is: A political
campaign is a big hassle, but it's not as big a hassle as going
through the City Council first."</TE>
<TE>   If the Simi Valley measure passes, Shigley said, it's possible
that growth-control activists will follow suit in other cities,
trying to shrink urban boundaries just a few years after voters
approved the first set. "I could see them trying the same thing in
Oxnard, Camarillo and even Ventura," Shigley said.</TE>
<TE>   In Northern California, on the east side of the San Francisco Bay,
Alameda County is Ventura's growth-control counterpart. There, half a
dozen ballot measures focus on stopping construction on vacant land
one parcel at a time.</TE>
<TE>   Voters in Pleasanton, a picturesque foothill suburb in the East
Bay, will decide whether to block construction of affordable housing
on 318 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Dueling measures in Alameda, an island city in the East Bay off
Oakland, center on a 22-acre rail yard. One initiative would change
the land's current urban use to permanent open space.</TE>
<TE>   "People are looking to Manhattan-ize the Bay Area," said Jean
Sweeney, chair of Alameda Open Space. "My attitude is we ought to put
a cap on the number of people who can live here."</TE>
<TE>   The rival measure would allow a developer to build a 200-home
subdivision.</TE>
<TE>   Farther inland, communities struggling to keep their small-town
feel are considering growth caps.</TE>
<TE>   Halfway between Stockton and Sacramento, in the heart of the Delta
Recreation Area, the city of Galt is one of the Central Valley's
fastest growing communities. Residents worried that Galt could become
the next Elk Grove -- a burgeoning Sacramento suburb --want home
building limited to 300 units a year.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents argue that the restriction would force developers to
build out of town, robbing the city of tax revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, voters in Windsor -- a small town nestled in the
Russian River grape-growing region of Sonoma County -- could tighten
a cap on housing permits they adopted in 1997. Like other communities
in Sonoma and Napa counties, the pioneers of California's slow-growth
movement, Windsor has a growth boundary. But the initiative would
determine how fast homes get built inside that urban limit line to
ensure that roads, sewers and schools can keep pace, supporters say.</TE>
<TE>   Such fights over growth may only distract Californians from
important regional planning efforts, says Gerald Raycraft, planning
director of the Assn. of Bay Area Governments, a council of nine
counties and 101 cities.</TE>
<TE>   The group last month unveiled a "smart-growth" plan for the Bay
Area -- a 20-year vision to limit sprawl, provide affordable housing
and preserve open space. It was less than enthusiastically received.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy to say 'more people' is the problem," Raycraft said.
"Ballot-box planning tends to be a simplistic approach to fixing
something that's more complex."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Detweiler, a consultant to the state Senate Local Government
Committee, attributes the trend to an absence of leadership at the
state level.</TE>
<TE>   "As a result, the wider debate -- what kind of California should
exist in the future -- has not been engaged for years," said
Detweiler, who has tracked such trends for 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Communities are left to bludgeon each other with the only legal
weapons they have in their grasp," he said. "That results in
unnecessarily caustic political debates that can divide friends,
communities and families."</TE>
<TE>   An example is unfolding in Nevada County in the foothills of the
Sierra Nevada. That county, a popular retreat for Sacramento and San
Francisco residents with weekend homes there, is center stage for a
heated battle over property rights that has caught national
attention.</TE>
<TE>   A ballot measure would create a streamlined process for
reimbursing landowners when county regulations prohibit full
development of their property. The debate has pitted a mix of
conservative property owners, retirees, farmers and environmentalists
against one another.</TE>
<TE>   Russ Steele, a 64-year-old retired Air Force pilot, said
restrictions imposed by the county's "liberal" Board of Supervisors
have slowly eroded basic property rights.</TE>
<TE>   "At stake is our personal freedom," Steele said. "The government
is supposed to be protecting us. It's not supposed to be stealing
from us."</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Izzy Martin, a 16-year resident who grows
organic vegetables, said the landowners' measure goes too far. She
cites a study that predicts a $5-million to $10-million drain each
year on county coffers.</TE>
<TE>   "It represents a huge opportunity for speculators to make windfall
profits out of the Nevada County general fund," Martin said.</TE>
<TE>   Election season is always "contact-sport time" in rural counties,
Martin said. But this time, she said, she has been compared to the
terrorists who destroyed the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   An Oregon initiative similar to the one in Nevada County was
struck down by the courts last month, but Steele believes his can
withstand legal challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is, this is [a] groundbreaking initiative," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That is why many planning experts across the state are keeping a
close eye on it. They're also watching another local measure that
could set a positive precedent.</TE>
<TE>   In the farm town of Watsonville, near Salinas, a ballot measure
represents a compromise between factions that have feuded over growth
for decades.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers, environmentalists, Latino leaders and business groups
have agreed on a plan that outlines specific areas for urban growth,
farming and open-space preservation, said Patrick McCormick, a state
planning agency officer in Santa Cruz County.</TE>
<TE>   After fighting an inconclusive annexation battle in 1999, the
warring groups formed their own nonprofit agency to plan the
community's future, McCormick said. "Everybody was willing to give up
something because they all liked what they got," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "For communities in California who are at loggerheads to resolve
important public issues, it's potentially a great model."</TE>

<HD>Music, Art School Promotes Creativity</HD>

<LD>One day after school last week, 10-year-old Allison Iraheta was a
zombie. Lots of students might feel that way after a long day of
classes, but Allison also was a nun, bully, ballroom dancer and good
Samaritan, all in the space of about two minutes.</LD>
<LD>   With the exception of the zombie, which happened to be her
Halloween costume, the roles were part of an improvisation exercise
in a drama class at the Los Angeles Music and Art School, a hive of
creativity in East Los Angeles for generations.</LD>
<LD>   Established in 1945, the private, nonprofit center offers modestly
priced instruction to children and adults in music, dance, theater
and visual arts. Classes are held after school and on Saturdays.
Every summer, the school is home to Camp Lamas, an eight-week arts
program. With more than 900 students, the school is bursting at the
seams, and is about to undertake a fund-raising campaign so it can
add onto its 3rd Street building, which was completed in 1967.</LD>
<TE>   On the same afternoon that Steve Pell's drama students were doing
the improvisation exercise, other teachers were leading ballet and
painting classes, and giving individual instruction in guitar, piano
and voice. "This place is the greatest thing for kids," said Lupe
Diaz, a longtime Eastside resident. "It keeps them interested,
instead of going outside and getting into trouble. They really get
into it."</TE>
<TE>   Diaz, 71, began taking art classes at the school in the 1970s. In
the '80s, she brought her children; today, she brings her
grandchildren and is continuing her own art studies under the
direction of Andrea Gabriel, one of 42 part-time teachers.</TE>
<TE>   The school, which relies primarily on private donations, received
$15,000 from last year's Los Angeles Times Holiday Campaign. Gifts to
the campaign go to nonprofit organizations serving the needy in Los
Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties.
Although organizations cannot receive money from the Holiday Campaign
two years in a row, the Music and Arts School is an example of the
kind of recipient that benefits from the effort.</TE>
<TE>   "I think having a program like this in this area is really
important," said Executive Director Isela Sotelo. Children, she said,
"can be playing out in the street or they can be part of this
program."</TE>
<TE>   A less tangible benefit -- but one just as important -- can be
seen on the faces of students concentrating on a ballet position or
piano movement, a brushstroke or dramatic gesture. "It's positive;
it's very energetic," said Patricia Hawthorne, who brings her
6-year-old son to after-school piano and drama classes. "I think it's
made him more self-confident, and it brings out his creativeness."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>OAKLAND -- Pastor Bob Jackson ministers on the urban battlefield of
East Oakland, a gritty stretch of liquor stores, fast food
restaurants and vacant lots where he has seen the value of life drop
like a spent shell casing.</LD>
<LD>   One by one, the gray-haired leader of the Acts Full Gospel Church
points out the street corners where young men have been gunned down.
The reasons make him shake his head: drug-peddling turf wars. Drunken
arguments. Retaliation for some perceived personal slight.</LD>
<LD>   Oakland's murder rate -- last year the highest per capita for any
major California city -- is continuing its ominous rise after one of
the bloodiest summers in years. When police found the latest victim
Sunday, the grim tally reached 95 -- 10 more than the 2001 homicide
total Oakland reported to federal authorities.</LD>
<TE>   Eight of 10 victims are African American, two-thirds of them
younger than 35. And 97% of the 55 suspects identified by police are
black. The youngest victim was 15; the oldest 70.</TE>
<TE>   The body count has sent a chill through this working class
community, where Mayor Jerry Brown labors to attract new business to
a city known for deadly violence. It has caused politicians to point
fingers over how best to resolve this newest spike in murders. And,
as the police force endures an embarrassing federal trial of four of
its own officers, citizens question who is more dangerous -- the drug
dealers or the police.</TE>
<TE>   As Jackson looks for answers, he doesn't mention either police or
politicians; he looks to the community itself.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson is the leader of the fledgling group Black Men First, 200
African American professionals, from lawyers to plumbers, who are
weary of watching the funeral hearses creep through their
neighborhoods. Group members walk the streets, opening dialogues with
young drug dealers who loiter in their midst. They have ventured to
West Oakland's Dogtown, which police consider especially dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   And they are rallying black males to play more constructive roles,
such as voting and volunteering at schools.</TE>
<TE>   "These killings aren't a police problem. They're a black problem,"
said Jackson, a taut 57-year-old former college football player now
presiding over one of Oakland's largest black churches. "I blame a
lack of education and family structure. There's no men at home or in
the city schools. These youths have no role models but rap video
stars and drug dealers."</TE>
<TE>   Brown insisted that the homicide rate is not out of character for
a city Oakland's size. He pointed out that the death toll is roughly
half the record of 165 reported in 1992 -- carnage that gave Oakland
a dubious reputation as "Murdertown, U.S.A."</TE>
<TE>   Damaged Esteem</TE>
<TE>   In comparison, San Francisco, with a population twice the size of
Oakland's 400,000, has had 25% fewer murders in recent years: 67 in
2001 and 53 through September. Los Angeles--a city of 3.7 million
people--had 550 murders last year and 489 through last month.</TE>
<TE>   "This kind of violence is part of the urban experience, from the
South Bronx to Los Angeles," Brown said. "But the fact is that
Oakland is changing at a pace faster than any other time since World
War II. Is it perfect? No. But overall crime is 40% below what it's
been over a 30-year average."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the killings have damaged the self-esteem of a city reeling
from the collapse of its beginning high-tech industry, a place where
the Sears and Roebuck store remains downtown's only chain retailer.</TE>
<TE>   Unemployment hovers at 10%, and one in five families lives at or
below the poverty line, city statistics show.</TE>
<TE>   The killings have also hit middle-class residents. In August, the
older brother of a veteran Oakland police officer was killed after he
scolded youths for making their car tires squeal in his neighborhood.
Black leaders say the mayhem has prompted a new round of black flight
from a city that's 36% African American.</TE>
<TE>   "Ride around Oakland, and you'll see young people with nothing to
do, standing on corners with their hands in their pockets," said a
civil rights lawyer, John Burris. "You know that environment isn't
going to lead anywhere but trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Business consultant Will G. Bass Jr. joined Black Men First to
talk sense to those young men.</TE>
<TE>   The former church sports coach is convinced the youths will
listen. "If you feel it from your heart and are honest in your
approach, the kids will feel it, too," he said. "If you go in talking
down to them, they'll feel that as well."</TE>
<TE>   Bass said most Oakland youths, even many drug dealers, are not bad
at heart: "As black men, our backs are against the wall now. We've
got no choice but to go in and fight for these kids."</TE>
<TE>   To try to stop the killing in more traditional ways, Brown seeks
to hire 100 new police officers. To raise the needed $70 million, the
city council voted 7-1 to add a measure to November's ballot to
increase hotel, parking and utility taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Nancy Nadel, the lone holdout, says some of the money
should go to job programs and anger management seminars for
ex-offenders.</TE>
<TE>   Brown disagrees.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you watch 'The Sopranos?' Ever see 'The Godfather?' " he asked
in an interview. "Do you think if we put the Godfather and his gang
in a job program, they'd change their line of work? Do you think
they'd benefit from a little anger management? Well, we've got the
same kinds of crime groups in this city."</TE>
<TE>   Police are also frustrated that tight-lipped residents often
withhold information that might help solve many killings.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland homicide Lt. Brian Thiem described a killing outside a
bar. "One hundred people, and nobody knows nothing," said Thiem, who
attributes the public silence to a fear among residents of being
labeled a "snitch."</TE>
<TE>   Others cited a different reason -- an antipathy for law
enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Officers on Trial</TE>
<TE>   As the four Oakland cops nicknamed the "Riders" stand trial on
charges that they faked evidence, planted drugs and beat suspects,
black leaders say public confidence in the police force has reached
an all-time low.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a community that really does view police as an occupying
force," said Burris, who represents numerous victims in the Riders
trial.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say Oakland's homicide rise follows a nationwide trend.</TE>
<TE>   "The size of the young adult cohort is increasing, with more
people reaching the peak age of criminal activity, between 15 and
25," said Jack Riley, of Santa Monica's Rand Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Crime dropped in the 1990s, thanks to higher felon incarceration
rates, a stronger economy and a diminishing crack cocaine epidemic.
But now the trend is reversing itself, Riley said.</TE>
<TE>   Each year, he said, California releases 100,000 parolees from
state prisons "with poor prospects for finding jobs or staying off
drugs."</TE>
<TE>   Oakland gets its share of those felons. Brown, who receives
regular police briefings on homicide rates, said 50% of the city's
murder victims have criminal records with five or more felonies
apiece. Thirty percent have more than 10 felonies apiece.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson has identified 23 neighborhood trouble spots and 200
suspects who he believes are at the root of the city's drug problem.</TE>
<TE>   The Oakland native founded the Men of Valor Academy in Oakland,
where 50 youths are housed and fed, as a way to reduce the pull of
street gangs and work toward a high school degree equivalent.</TE>
<TE>   "These boys have never been mentored or taught by anybody," he
said. "Most come from single-parent homes where their mothers talk
about how they're growing up to be just like their no-good fathers.
Black girls do better because they've got their mothers as models.
But not the boys -- they're programmed to be bad."</TE>
<TE>   Police Troubled</TE>
<TE>   The murders trouble police, too. Thiem, a homicide detective
during the record year, 1992, recognizes a hangdog look among his
men. "The dead come day after day, and you bang your head against the
wall," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Across town, Jackson mourned another youth lost to the violence.</TE>
<TE>   He and Bass visited the site outside his Men of Valor Academy
where a suspected gang member had been shot after a traffic
confrontation.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson and a fellow activist stood over a memorial of wilted
roses and spent Remy Martin cognac bottles. And they grimaced.</TE>
<TE>   "Alcohol is the painkiller for these boys," Bass said. "The
problem runs from the cradle to the tomb, from when they're babies
until they're old men. The problem is, they never get to become old
men."</TE>

<HD>Angels Seats That Get You a Trim</HD>
<DH>Complete with 'dugout,' Fountain Valley barbershop is like
being there.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jennifer Mena</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The way his customers see it, Lance Martin long ago tied the fortunes
of his Fountain Valley barbershop to the Anaheim Angels.</LD>
<LD>   Six years ago, he moved to Magnolia Street near Talbert Avenue and
decorated the nondescript strip mall shop with baseball memorabilia.
The establishment, On Deck, soon became not only a guy's place to
talk about ball but also a tribute to the Angels -- long before they
were World Series champions.</LD>
<LD>   Martin put a lot of work into a place that charges $8 for a cut,
$6 for senior citizens.</LD>
<TE>   He bought eight beige metal folding seats from the old Anaheim
Stadium -- pulled out when the Big A became the Big Ed -- for $26
apiece and installed them right on the linoleum floor. Then he built
a green "dugout" over them. He covered the walls with pictures of the
Angels of old, a mural print of a baseball game, plus items from
other teams his customers brought in, such as a 1946 Brooklyn Dodgers
scorecard.</TE>
<TE>   "I figured I have to be here every day, so I have to be surrounded
by things I like and talk about what I like," Martin said.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, as he clipped countless heads of hair, he would
always defend the Angels, no matter how badly they had goofed up. His
passionate defense always managed to make the guys look up from their
sports magazines. Last month, when the Angels stumbled briefly in the
World Series, he dared to stand up for his team to a paying customer.</TE>
<TE>   "He was getting my blood boiling. He was really getting to me. He
was saying, 'They are going to let you down again,' " said the
48-year-old Fountain Valley resident.</TE>
<TE>   "We live here in Orange County. I would never root for another
team," he said. "Even though they were bad, they deserved [our
support]. They deserved the World Series. They never gave up."</TE>
<TE>   Most regulars appreciate that courage: "He stayed with the team at
all costs," said Andy Garcia, 44, tears welling in his eyes. "I went
to the Dodgers and came back, but he stuck with them. And I should
have done that. My grandfather poured concrete at the original
Anaheim Stadium. My grandmother watched every [Angels] game. My
mother is a fan."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, now, a World Series victory later, all the bragging
rights belong to Martin and employees Michael Harvey and Doc Willis.</TE>
<TE>   Martin wants to put out more Angels memorabilia, including World
Series commemorative bats. He will paint his dugout red. He ponders
the possibility that new customers will come because of the Angels
victory. He jokes that maybe Ramon Ortiz, the Angels pitcher and
trained barber, will want to work at On Deck in the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   Martin recently put an ad in a weekly paper congratulating the
Angels. Now he's seeing new faces, people like Orange County
firefighter Dan Hanson and his son Nic, who were curious about a
baseball-themed barbershop.</TE>
<TE>   Father and son were in the shop only a few minutes last week when
they knew they were in the right place to talk Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd go to the stadium when there were only 3,000 fans. You could
get in with a $3 ticket, and by the third inning you could be in one
of the front rows," said the father, suddenly enveloped in three
decades of baseball memories.</TE>
<TE>   That's just what Martin hoped when he envisioned his shop after
working in several others during 32 years as a barber. He joined the
trade at age 16. He finished his studies at the Royal Academy of Hair
Design in Anaheim, owned by his barber father, before graduating from
La Quinta High School in Westminster.</TE>
<TE>   About 25 regulars have stuck with him as he moved from shop to
shop. Like Martin, most of them have less hair these days.</TE>
<TE>   "I love his theme," said Craig MacDonald of Huntington Beach, a
customer since On Deck opened. "I learn something new about baseball
every time I'm in here."</TE>
<TE>   The theme doesn't stop at the shop's door. Martin and son Trevor,
19, play in a local adult league after work. The game has been a
lifelong pursuit for Martin, who played baseball in high school.</TE>
<TE>   The shop's decor isn't wasted even on a Yankee fan like Rich
DeFrain, 30. He says he finds the place endearing because he knows
Martin lives by his convictions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the last places in Orange County where you can feel
at home and get our hair cut at the same time," said DeFrain. "And I
feel that way even though the Angels beat the Yankees."</TE>

<HD>41 Hurt in 198-Vehicle Smashup</HD>
<DH>Early morning fog, slick roads and speeding combine to
litter the Long Beach Freeway with wreckage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Gottlieb and Daniel Hernandez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By the time the last of the 198 vehicles had piled into each other
Sunday, the Long Beach Freeway looked like the site of a demolition
derby.</LD>
<LD>   The massive chain reaction, which resulted in two major pileups,
began at 6:45 a.m. as motorists were driving too fast through
unusually dense fog, according to the CHP. Even the officers were
amazed that no one was killed.</LD>
<LD>   Forty-one people were injured, nine of them critically. Most of
those taken to nearby hospitals were treated and released.</LD>
<TE>   It was a mixture of fog more common to the Central Valley and the
traffic of Southern California freeways.</TE>
<TE>   Motorists told of being blinded by the fog, suddenly ramming into
a vehicle in front of them or being rear-ended.</TE>
<TE>   As Jennifer Ratin headed to the Long Beach Airport for a business
trip to Dallas-Fort Worth, the fog became thicker and thicker.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic slowed, then stopped. A car clipped her on the left. She
looked in her rearview mirror and saw another car speeding toward
her, as if the driver had no idea the vehicles in front of her had
stopped. She grabbed the steering wheel and steeled herself.</TE>
<TE>   "He hit me like I've never been hit before," Ratin said.</TE>
<TE>   Her Mercury Mountaineer was pushed across two lanes and turned in
the opposite direction, stopping inches from a road sign. "Once I got
out of the car I still could hear cars hitting each other," she said.</TE>
<TE>   James Acosta was driving the '94 Buick Riviera he had bought three
weeks ago. He started hearing the "booms" of cars smashing into each
other when he hit an oil slick. He said his brakes locked and he
crashed into the guardrail, then was sideswiped. "It was like a
whirling dervish," he said, still shaken hours later.</TE>
<TE>   Around him, cars and trucks in the southbound lanes faced every
direction, gnarled, crushed and bent. The smell of gasoline filled
the air. A blue semitruck sat in the middle of a 20-car pileup, its
windshield wipers occasionally giving a swipe. A Toyota Camry was
smashed into another semi.</TE>
<TE>   Along a stretch of more than a mile, workmen dragged away pieces
of fenders and car body parts.</TE>
<TE>   Tow truck drivers lined up along the freeway like cabdrivers at a
fancy hotel, waiting for fares. One tow truck even had to drag off
another tow truck that apparently had been caught in the crash.</TE>
<TE>   There were five minor accidents on the northbound side of the
freeway when careless drivers slowed to look at the opposing lanes,
officers said.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, both sides of the freeway between the Artesia and the
San Diego freeways were closed. By Sunday evening all lanes were back
in use.</TE>
<TE>   Because of live television coverage, the wreckage became an
instant tourist attraction. Long Beach officers eventually began
ticketing sightseers who walked up closed freeway ramps to stroll
among the debris.</TE>
<TE>   It took most of the day for officers to talk with all those
involved and for motorists to have their cars towed away or drive
away those that still ran.</TE>
<TE>   The CHP late Sunday was still trying to piece together the
sequence of events. CHP officials said there were two major pileups.
The first occurred near the San Diego Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   The second, which started a short time later, took place farther
north, near Del Amo Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   CHP Capt. Cliff Williams said the fog, which cut visibility to 100
feet, was among the worst he had ever seen. Motorists agreed. "You
couldn't see another car in front of you," said Rafael Lopez of
Upland.</TE>
<TE>   Those caught in Sunday's pileup said the fog mixed with oil that
leaked onto the freeway made the road nearly impossible to navigate.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers said that even when they couldn't see what was happening
they could hear cars around them smashing into each other.</TE>
<TE>   Sergio Moran had been driving his semi to the Port of Long Beach
to deliver diesel fuel.</TE>
<TE>   His truck escaped with minor damage to the front fender after an
out-of-control car came rocketing at him from the side.</TE>
<TE>   Moran had hit the brakes so hard that they burned the back tires.</TE>
<TE>   He looked at the pile of wrecked cars in front of him, which he
had missed by a few feet. "It's unbelievable," he said. "These people
walked away."</TE>
<TE>   Teresita Alvarez, 36, of Downey was driving to work. She pulled
into the center divider when she saw a pileup.</TE>
<TE>   Cars slamming into each other sounded "like aluminum cans,
crashing and crashing and crashing. I ran along the center divider
yelling, 'My God! My God! My God!' All I could think of were my five
kids," Alvarez said.</TE>
<TE>   Michael James stood in the middle of the freeway, taking down
information about the Oldsmobile Cutlass he said had smashed into his
car.</TE>
<TE>   James said that he was driving about 40 mph because of the fog.</TE>
<TE>   He started slowing and then started skidding.</TE>
<TE>   "Next thing I know, I'm hit from the rear end" and he crashed into
the car in front of him, James said.</TE>
<TE>   His mouth smashed into the steering wheel with enough force to
bend the wheel.</TE>
<TE>   He had bought his '87 Cadillac less than a week ago and hadn't
transferred the insurance. "It was a pretty car too," he said with a
shrug.</TE>
<TE>   Lupe Gomez, 54, was one of the lucky ones.</TE>
<TE>   After a Honda cut in front of her, she swerved to the right and
made a quick left to miss a pile of smashed cars.</TE>
<TE>   "I screamed," she said, holding out her hand, which still was
shaking. The 2003 SUV she bought three weeks ago was untouched.</TE>

<HD>Chef Gray Reviews Deli Dining, Rice Cakes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patt Morrison</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gray Davis, having wrapped up the Mammon part of the candidate's job,
was catching up on the God bits, campaigning in East Oakland at Allen
Temple Baptist Church, meeting with black ministers and community
activists.</LD>
<LD>   Afterward, reporters tossed questions at Davis about allegations
by Mark L. Nathanson, a former state coastal commissioner, that the
governor egged him on to approve certain coastal projects for
potential Davis donors.</LD>
<LD>   Aides cut off the questions, saying Davis had to meet with black
ministers in San Francisco before joining up with the president of
the Philippines.</LD>
<TE>   As the governor walked away, one reporter shouted out to ask the
president whether he'd ever dined with Nathanson at Nate 'n Al's
deli, where Nathanson said he and Davis transacted dubious business.</TE>
<TE>   Without breaking stride, the governor called over his shoulder,
"I'm not going to get into a debate with a convicted felon," and then
added, after a pause, "If you've ever been to Nate 'n Al's, you
wouldn't call it 'dine.' "</TE>
<TE>   The cautious governor quickly withdrew the barb, pointing out that
Nate 'n Al's is a fine delicatessen.</TE>
<TE>   More food news from Chef Gray: At a get-out-the-vote rally in
Monterey Park, Davis ticked off a list of his Asian American
appointees and achievements, and then mentioned a regulation that
"the Korean community was concerned" about, requiring that rice cakes
be refrigerated for health reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "That kind of undermines the whole purpose of eating rice cakes,"
Chef Gray said. If refrigerated, "they're like hockey pucks when you
bite into them.</TE>
<TE>   "So we were able to pass a law, I was very pleased to sign the
law, that said as long as you sell them within 24 hours -- there's a
little date stamp on there when they were manufactured -- you do not
have to refrigerate them, allowing the Korean community to sell rice
cakes as they have traditionally sold them, which was of great
importance to the Korean community.</TE>
<TE>   "And if you've eaten rice cakes, which I have, they taste a lot
better than if they're frozen. You have to have very strong teeth if
they're frozen."</TE>
<TE>   The crowd, well, ate it up.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic Party Bash Heads West</TE>
<TE>   For time out of mind, which in California is at least 20 years,
the state's Democratic Party has thrown its election night bash at
downtown L.A.'s Biltmore Hotel, now known as the Millennium Biltmore.</TE>
<TE>   But behind the gilt and marble lurked fire marshals, who did not
hesitate to crack down on the crowds as ballrooms and meeting rooms
filled to overflowing with celebrants or mourners monitoring vote
counts.</TE>
<TE>   Now and again the doors have been barred to big names and even
bigger-moneyed contributors.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' own political strategist, Garry South, who has gotten many
politicians out of tight places, on one occasion could not talk
himself into one at the Biltmore.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been an ugly scene every time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So this year, the SoCal Democratic caravansary moves its Tuesday
night do to the Century Plaza Hotel in Century City. Davis,
superstitious about matters electoral, thought the move "would be a
jinx," South said. But this time, it was the governor who got vetoed.</TE>
<TE>   'Presidential' Backing Brings Applause on Cue</TE>
<TE>   The Big Man himself, endorsing a city measure?</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica's Measure JJ would endorse what the City Council
there already approved -- expanding on existing "living wage"
ordinances that find the minimum wage inadequate for meeting real
costs of living for the working poor, including rent and health
insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Cities such as L.A. and San Francisco already require living wages
from companies that deal with city contracts or get city aid.</TE>
<TE>   But Santa Monica's would be the first living-wage measure to apply
to private employers -- in this case principally targeting the big
luxury seaside hotels.</TE>
<TE>   It's being monitored closely throughout the country because, as we
all know, when it comes to social policy, "as California goes, so
goes the nation."</TE>
<TE>   First entertained by ex-Doorsman and Santa Monican John Densmore
and his Afro Latino jazz band, contributors then heard from
activists, a hotel worker and the Wednesday night president, Martin
Sheen of "The West Wing."</TE>
<TE>   In front of the crowd, which applauded on his cue, Sheen recorded
a yes-on-JJ message to be telephoned to Santa Monica voters. He
needed only two takes -- plenty of time, he pointed out to the crowd,
to "still be able to get home and see your favorite TV show."</TE>
<TE>   Loser in Mayor's Race Keeps Up His Visibility</TE>
<TE>   Who's the man whose face seems to be on more campaign mailers than
Bill Simon's -- and he's not even running for anything? At least this
time.</TE>
<TE>   It's Antonio Villaraigosa, the former Democratic speaker of the
Assembly, who lost the L.A. mayor's race in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, his picture appears five times on the Yes on B flier
for L.A. County trauma care (once with Sheriff Lee Baca), and three
times on one Yes on K flier for more school construction bucks.</TE>
<TE>   Villaraigosa has been at least as visible around town as the man
who beat him, Jim Hahn, showing up at Ed and Cindy Asner's house a
couple of weeks ago for a salon with Dennis Kucinich, the Ohio
congressman who's become a progressive hero, and at Stanley and Betty
Sheinbaum's house supporting the living-wage measure in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   No surprise that word on the street -- at least in the 90012 ZIP
Code pages of the Thomas Bros. guide -- is that Villaraigosa is
leaving his old Mount Washington neighborhood to run in the 14th
Council District for the seat of Nick Pacheco, who supported Hahn for
mayor.</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * Not long ago, his election days were spent plotting the course
of Congress. This year, Newt Gingrich, former speaker of the House,
will spend election day at a news conference followed by a
luncheon-lecture for students and faculty as part of the Res Publica
speaker series at Claremont McKenna College.</TE>
<TE>   * L.A. Police Chief Bill Bratton's boss and possible fellow
Brentwoodian, Police Commission President Rick Caruso, threw a
private party for about 200 people for the new chief, an event whose
floral decor alone, an overwhelmed guest estimated, probably cost
nearly five figures. Jim Hahn spoke. Then Bratton spoke. And then
Bratton's wife, Court TV anchor Rikki Klieman, spoke -- and spoke --
singing the praises of her boy in LAPD blue. Cameras were rolling: A
"60 Minutes" crew evidently was the only media members permitted on
the premises.</TE>
<TE>   * Mayor who? At a reception for key Los Angeles-area officials at
KNBC-TV in Burbank, NBC news anchor Tom Brokaw thanked the group for
gathering, including "the mayor" -- and indicated City Atty. Rocky
Delgadillo. "No," came a voice from the crowd, "the mayor's over
here" -- and Brokaw swung to look at Jim Hahn. "Yes, of course,"
Brokaw said smoothly. (A smile crossed the face of Antonio
Villaraigosa, the man Hahn beat for the mayor's job.) And Hahn spoke
his father Kenneth's name more often than his own as he campaigned
for mayor. But still, an Associated Press story in the New York Times
on Bratton's swearing in referred to L.A.'s mayor as "Kenneth K.
Hahn."</TE>
<TE>   * His name will still be on the ballot for Santa Monica City
Council but lifelong peace activist Jerry Rubin announced at a news
conference -- where "a light but healthful lunch" was served -- that
health concerns and the presence of four other like-minded candidates
on the ballot mean he's withdrawing from the race. Endorsing the
four, he said: "I think the city will do just fine even if Jerry
Rubin is not on the council."</TE>
<TE>   * Sports notes: a plane towing a "Simon for Governor" banner flew
overhead, but Anaheim's mayor, Tom Daly, was touting the man of the
hour, the Angels' manager. Daly shouted to the crowd at an Angel
rally, "Mike Scioscia for governor! Mike Scioscia for governor!"</TE>
<TE>   * Location, location, location: Ronald Reagan's onetime Southern
California gubernatorial headquarters became a strip club, and Jim
Hahn's former mayoral headquarters on Crenshaw Boulevard is now the
City Council campaign office of ... Bernard C. Parks, whose option as
LAPD chief Hahn chose not to pick up.</TE>
<TE>   You Can Quote Me</TE>
<TE>   "Too legit!"</TE>
<TE>   Teenage choir girls squealing at First AME Church in Los Angeles,
excited at spotting a celebrity on the premises during Gray Davis'
political stopover at the huge and politically influential church.
The celebrity? Not Davis -- rap singer Hammer, guest pastor for the
noon service, and trailed by a camera crew for a reality TV show he's
making. "Too Legit" comes from the title of an early Hammer album.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MEDIA MOMENT: They're too young to vote, but not too young to be
photo ops for California gubernatorial candidates Bill Simon Jr.,

<HD>Vote Due Soon on Saddleback Meadows Project</HD>
<DH>Supervisors' action is set for Tuesday. Opponents say the
date was selected to favor passage of the contested development.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of Orange County's longest-running development battles could end
Tuesday, when the Board of Supervisors is scheduled to vote on
whether to allow 283 homes to be built at Saddleback Meadows, a
historic hillside ranching site at the doorstep of the Cleveland
National Forest.</LD>
<LD>   Developer after developer has fought since the 1970s to win
approval to build on the steep, landslide-prone slopes between two
monasteries. The site's development history has as many twists and
turns as the winding county roads it sits near. Lawsuits have stalled
plans, a previous owner went bankrupt, and negotiations to buy and
preserve it fell apart amid bitter finger-pointing.</LD>
<LD>   Fresh controversy erupted late last week, with opponents charging
that 3rd District Supervisor Todd Spitzer scheduled the vote on
election day in hopes of getting the project passed before possibly
leaving office.</LD>
<TE>   Spitzer, who represents the Saddleback Meadows area, is running to
replace Bill Campbell in the 71st Assembly District. If he wins, his
last day as supervisor will be Nov. 19. He has voted for the project
in the past, dismaying area residents.</TE>
<TE>   County planners and attorneys "didn't want to risk not having a
vote taken [Nov. 19] because that's Spitzer's last day, and this is
something he's pushing fast and furiously," said Ed Connor, an
attorney representing the Ramakrishna Monastery, which has fought the
project for years. "They didn't want to take any chances that he
couldn't vote on this."</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer did not respond to several calls seeking comment. His
spokesman, Jeff Solsby, said Friday that Spitzer won't have "any
public comment until after the public meeting on Tuesday."</TE>
<TE>   Jason Grange, a spokesman for landowner California Quartet of
Sacramento, said he could not comment on the vote's timing. But
Grange said that battles over the site have gone on long enough, that
concerns about wildlife and grading have been addressed. "We've
invested seven years in the application process, and it has now been
recommended for approval by the county staff [and] approved by the
Planning Commission," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been through exhaustive environmental study, and it's time
to move forward with this project."</TE>
<TE>   Grange noted that the company inherited approvals for 705 mobile
homes to be built when it bought the property.</TE>
<TE>   The company and county staff, he said, consider 283 homes with 70%
of the land set aside as open space a vastly preferable alternative.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents, including St. Michael's Roman Catholic Abbey and the
Hindu-affiliated Ramakrishna Monastery, say that the amount of
grading necessary to build the homes is unprecedented even in
development-friendly Orange County and that the serenity of their
sylvan retreats would be destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   They say no developer will build 705 mobile homes because the high
grading costs would make it financially unfeasible.</TE>
<TE>   Conner said that an alternative, lower-density proposal offered by
environmentalists and the monasteries would net the developer up to
$20 million, while leaving intact huge stands of live oaks, vernal
pools that are home to half of the county's endangered Riverside
fairy shrimp population, and pristine canyons.</TE>
<TE>   Federal and state regulators have also voiced opposition to the
development, saying it would destroy a crucial wildlife corridor
between the county's central coast and proposed nature preserves in
South County.</TE>
<TE>   As late as last week, Karen Evans of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
office in Carlsbad said that those concerns have not been addressed
by California Quartet's proposed wildlife link.</TE>
<TE>   Grange, however, contends that testimony by Dennis Murphy, a
University of Nevada biology professor who worked on the county's
original nature preserve, before the county Planning Commission in
August runs counter to regulators' and environmentalists' claims.
Murphy believes that there is no wildlife corridor on the land.</TE>
<TE>   Grange also said opponents' proposed alternative had been studied
and was "not feasible."</TE>
<TE>   As the vote drew close, there was a flurry of meetings and
lobbying. Tod D. Brown, bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of
Orange, had lunch with Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Cynthia P.
Coad on Friday, among others, to press the case that the project
should be stopped.</TE>
<TE>   Coad said in an interview that she hasn't decided how to vote.</TE>
<TE>   The vote could end in a tie, as it has in the past, if Supervisor
Jim Silva opts to recuse himself. Silva has regularly absented
himself from votes on the project since Aradi, a former owner that
has the same managing partner as California Quartet, was fined
$14,000 for allegedly laundering political contributions to Silva
through its employees. The company did not admit any guilt but paid
the fines.</TE>
<TE>   Silva was not charged with any wrongdoing and has never been
barred from voting on the project but has voluntarily recused
himself. He did not return calls for comment on the Tuesday's vote.</TE>

<HD>Secession Campaigns Wind Down to Quiet Finish, Even in the
Valley</HD>
<DH>Separatists walk precincts, but they are greatly
outnumbered by breakup opponents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sue Fox and Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the final weekend day to reach voters before they cast ballots in
Los Angeles' secession campaigns, an odd silence settled across much
of the city Sunday, with large areas untouched by the limited efforts
mustered by those pressing for breakup.</LD>
<LD>   In South-Central and East Los Angeles, a few secession advocates
walked precincts, but they were far outnumbered by more than 700
anti-secession volunteers, many of them union members, striding
door-to-door. At the Hollywood Farmers Market, secessionists tried,
without much luck, to engage passersby in discussion.</LD>
<LD>   San Fernando Valley secession leaders said they had no events
planned for areas outside the Valley. "Why would we?" asked Karen
Moran, a campaign spokeswoman.</LD>
<TE>   And the breakup campaign's Westside office was locked Sunday. Its
leaders said they were occupied with other matters.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in the middle of a lawsuit. I'm working on another project
today," said Rex Frankel, a Westchester environmentalist. He added
that he still supported breakup.</TE>
<TE>   To claim victory Tuesday, secessionists must attract a majority of
voters in the areas seeking independence, the San Fernando Valley and
Hollywood. But they also must prevail citywide, so the absence of a
visible campaign outside the breakaway regions so close to election
day could spell trouble.</TE>
<TE>   A recent Times poll of 970 likely voters showed heavy opposition
to both breakup proposals.</TE>
<TE>   Their strategy, secession leaders say, is to draw enough Valley
voters to tip the scales citywide.</TE>
<TE>   But things were quiet Sunday, even in the Valley. After a series
of earlier pro-cityhood events failed to attract large crowds,
separatists decided not to hold a get-out-the-vote rally.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, a cluster of die-hard workers made phone calls and handed
out posters to volunteers at campaign headquarters in Sherman Oaks. A
few precinct walkers also combed Valley streets seeking secession
votes, although there was no large-scale effort to canvass
neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm here campaigning for Valley independence," Chuck Betz, a
retired accountant from Sherman Oaks, told one voter. "Hopefully you
will consider voting for it on Tuesday."</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I think it would be kind of nice to have independence,"
replied Jorja Brittain, a 56-year-old personal trainer. "Beverly
Hills is its own city. I think we need to separate too, considering
the size of the Valley."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood separatists dispatched about 50 volunteers to walk
neighborhoods outside the breakaway areas, said secession leader Gene
La Pietra. The campaign also put out telephone calls with recorded
messages to 100,000 households in the rest of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "They are going to enjoy the same benefits we will have -- smaller
government, more local control, a better sense of identity," La
Pietra said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   But it was slow going Sunday at the Hollywood Farmers Market,
where both breakup supporters and opponents had tables loaded with
campaign literature. Christian Dunlop, a paid pro-secession worker
with shaggy hair and a pierced chin, tucked his campaign poster under
his arm and got ready to leave after two dispiriting hours spent
trying to drum up interest in the cause.</TE>
<TE>   "Today it's been pretty bad," Dunlop said. "Nobody is interested
in talking about this."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Merritt, a broker who is running for a seat on the proposed
Hollywood city council, agreed that most people were "disengaged"
from the secession debate.</TE>
<TE>   "They smile, but they're not enthusiastic," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't the case with Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, a
secession opponent who revved up dozens of precinct walkers Sunday
morning at the South-Central office of the African American Voter
Registration, Education and Participation Project.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going at them full-tilt," Ridley-Thomas told the
volunteers. The group has registered 22,000 new voters in black and
Latino neighborhoods this year.</TE>
<TE>   The volunteers headed out to tell voters that blacks and Latinos
benefit from unionized jobs in city government. A split might
jeopardize such jobs if the Valley decides to hire private service
providers, Ridley-Thomas warned.</TE>
<TE>   Secession leaders dispute that contention, saying they will honor
all union contracts. But they are free to negotiate fresh agreements
when the old ones expire, creating some uncertainty about the fate of
city jobs in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Washington, a junior at Cal State Northridge, carried the
anti-secession message door to door Sunday in a neighborhood just
west of the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   "It might be good for [the breakaway areas], but it's bad for
you," he told one woman. "It would take away funds from our city."</TE>
<TE>   Secession leaders once touted South-Central and Westchester as
strongholds of support. They assumed that both communities would
desert City Hall out of anger -- over the loss of Police Chief
Bernard Parks (in South-Central) and overdevelopment and expansion
plans for Los Angeles International Airport (in Westchester).</TE>
<TE>   But many ministers and most of the elected representatives of
those areas, with the recent and conspicuous exception of Councilman
Nate Holden, have come out strongly against secession.</TE>
<TE>   In Westchester, secession backers did not even open their Westside
headquarters until two weeks before the election. When they did, only
about a dozen people showed up.</TE>
<TE>   That shaky effort appeared to have virtually collapsed Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Frankel said the office was closed because "people are out in the
neighborhoods and making phone calls."</TE>
<TE>   But neither Frankel nor Valley secession leaders could provide
evidence showing where the volunteers were.</TE>
<TE>   Another Westside secession leader, Denny Schneider, said he could
not campaign because he was bedridden with six herniated disks. His
main concern, he added, is preventing airport expansion.</TE>
<TE>   Secession "is secondary," Schneider said.</TE>

<HD>Battered Women Lack Shelters</HD>
<DH>With only two facilities in Ventura County, victims must
decide whether to travel to distant sites or stay with abusers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jessica Blanchard</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly 500 battered women were turned away from Ventura County's two
emergency shelters last year, as the shelters struggle to find space
for the overwhelming number of domestic violence victims seeking
refuge.</LD>
<LD>   Victims' advocates say the numbers highlight a growing problem in
the county: The shortage of emergency shelter space means many
victims must choose between traveling to a shelter in a neighboring
county or remaining with their batterer until space opens up locally.</LD>
<LD>   It's a tough choice, one more and more women are being forced to
make, said Summer Loree, who helps manage a shelter for the Coalition
to End Sexual and Domestic Violence.</LD>
<TE>   "A lot of women will call ahead, and we have to let them know that
we can't guarantee them space," Loree said. " ... A lot of people
just don't call back."</TE>
<TE>   Domestic violence remains a vastly underreported crime, but more
victims seem to be stepping forward in recent years to get help, said
Sheriff's Sgt. Bob Sparks, a former supervisor in the department's
East County sexual assault unit.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to believe victims are becoming more aware and willing
to step forward and not be a victim anymore," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The two shelters in the county provide emergency housing for a
total of nine families at a time, but the demand for space far
exceeds the supply.</TE>
<TE>   "Our shelter stays full most of the time," said Jeff Selby,
division director for Interface, a social services agency that runs
the county's other domestic violence shelter. The need for shelter
spaces is so high, he said, that Interface could probably fill a
shelter twice the current facility's size on a regular basis.</TE>
<TE>   Loree has lost count of the hours she has spent calling shelters
in neighboring counties because no space is available at local
shelters. In recent years, she has been forced to dip into emergency
funds for hotel vouchers or to send women to shelters as far away as
Palm Desert because nothing was available nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Although it might be possible to arrange a ride to a shelter in
Santa Barbara or Riverside County, the distance can present a
hardship for the victim, who will have to return to Ventura County
several times for court appointments, counseling sessions and
meetings with victim advocates.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard enough to get everything taken care of within 30 days
when you're in the county, much less when you're far away with no
transportation," Loree said, referring to the time limit placed on
shelter users.</TE>
<TE>   Domestic violence victims may also suffer financially by being
placed in a shelter that is far from their jobs. If a woman has to
leave her job, she may be losing her only means of supporting
herself, said Rebecca Robertson, executive director of Domestic
Violence Solutions for Santa Barbara County, which operates three
shelters there.</TE>
<TE>   "We may be able to get her placed, but it's not necessarily going
to meet her goals," Robertson said. "Economic stability is one of the
key reasons people stay in an abusive relationship."</TE>
<TE>   Finding shelter space is only half the battle, advocates say.</TE>
<TE>   The duration of a typical shelter stay "just isn't enough time to
get your life back on track," Robertson said. Many women at the
shelters have limited resources and can't afford to move into an
apartment right away.</TE>
<TE>   Other factors compound the problem, such as the county's high cost
of living. Some victims have poor credit, making it unlikely they'll
be approved as renters. And there are often long waiting lists for
low-cost housing programs.</TE>
<TE>   Creating more transitional housing could alleviate the immediate
need for more shelter space, advocates said. Transitional housing
allows victims to live in low-cost apartments for up to 18 months,
while they work to become financially stable and independent -- a
crucial step for domestic violence victims attempting to build a new
life.</TE>
<TE>   "The shelter is a 30-day program, but we often find there is a
great need for more time for women to be able to reestablish
themselves in society," said Lisette Rodriguez, a spokeswoman for the
Coalition to End Sexual and Domestic Violence. "Oftentimes, they have
left in the middle of the night with very little resources. And it
takes time to get back on their feet."</TE>
<TE>   There are a few facilities in the area that offer transitional
housing. Santa Barbara offers 14 one-bedroom apartments, and
Interface operates a five-family, six-month transitional housing
facility in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   But shelter operators say funding is too tight to make any
expansion plans for the near future. As nonprofits, the shelters rely
on state grants and donations for most of their budgets.</TE>
<TE>   "Funding is always an issue," Rodriguez said.</TE>

<HD>County's Battered Women Often Have No Safe Haven</HD>
<DH>Shortage of shelters forces many domestic violence victims
to choose between distant facilities or staying with their abusers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jessica Blanchard</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly 500 battered women were turned away from Ventura County's two
emergency shelters last year, as the shelters struggle to find space
for the overwhelming number of domestic violence victims seeking
refuge.</LD>
<LD>   Victims' advocates say the numbers highlight a growing problem in
the county: The shortage of emergency shelter space means many
victims must choose between traveling to a shelter in a neighboring
county or remaining with their batterer until space opens up locally.</LD>
<LD>   It's a tough choice, one more and more women are being forced to
make, said Summer Loree, who helps manage a shelter for the Coalition
to End Sexual and Domestic Violence.</LD>
<TE>   "A lot of women will call ahead, and we have to let them know that
we can't guarantee them space," Loree said. " ... A lot of people
just don't call back."</TE>
<TE>   Domestic violence remains a vastly underreported crime, but more
victims seem to be stepping forward in recent years to get help, said
Sheriff's Sgt. Bob Sparks, a former supervisor in the department's
East County sexual assault unit.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to believe victims are becoming more aware and willing
to step forward and not be a victim anymore," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The two shelters in the county provide emergency housing for a
total of nine families at a time, but the demand for space far
exceeds the supply.</TE>
<TE>   "Our shelter stays full most of the time," said Jeff Selby,
division director for Interface, a social services agency that runs
the county's other domestic violence shelter.</TE>
<TE>   The need for shelter spaces is so high, he said, that Interface
could probably fill a shelter twice the current facility's size on a
regular basis.</TE>
<TE>   Loree has lost count of the hours she has spent calling shelters
in neighboring counties because no space is available at local
shelters. In recent years, she has been forced to dip into emergency
funds for hotel vouchers or to send women to shelters as far away as
Palm Desert or Lancaster because nothing was available nearby.</TE>
<TE>   "It really is common not to find anything," Loree said. "We spend
a lot of time searching for openings."</TE>
<TE>   Although it might be possible to arrange a ride to a shelter in
Santa Barbara or Riverside County, the distance can present a
hardship for the victim, who will have to return to Ventura County
several times for court appointments, counseling sessions and
meetings with victim advocates.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard enough to get everything taken care of within 30 days
when you're in the county, much less when you're far away with no
transportation," Loree said, referring to the time limit placed on
shelter users.</TE>
<TE>   Domestic violence victims may also suffer financially by being
placed in a shelter that is far from their jobs. If a woman has to
leave her job, she may be losing her only means of supporting
herself, said Rebecca Robertson, executive director of Domestic
Violence Solutions for Santa Barbara County, which operates three
shelters there.</TE>
<TE>   "We may be able to get her placed, but it's not necessarily going
to meet her goals," Robertson said. "Economic stability is one of the
key reasons people stay in an abusive relationship."</TE>
<TE>   For those reasons, some women have refused offers of space in
shelters outside the county in the hope that space will open up
locally.</TE>
<TE>   "There are those who are so scared, they'll go anywhere," Loree
said. "But others think they can appease the batterer until space
opens up at the [local] shelter, and that's really dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   Finding shelter space is only half the battle, advocates say.</TE>
<TE>   The duration of a typical shelter stay "just isn't enough time to
get your life back on track," Robertson said. Many women at the
shelters have limited resources and can't afford to move into an
apartment right away.</TE>
<TE>   Other factors compound the problem, such as the county's high cost
of living.</TE>
<TE>   Some victims have poor credit, making it unlikely they'll be
approved as renters. And there are often long waiting lists for
low-cost housing programs.</TE>
<TE>   "If a woman is doing everything she can to get [housing] within 30
days and she still hasn't been able to, we don't want to kick her
out," Loree said. "But that backs us up even more."</TE>
<TE>   Creating more transitional housing could alleviate the immediate
need for more shelter space, advocates said. Transitional housing
allows victims to live in low-cost apartments for up to 18 months,
while they work to become financially stable and independent -- a
crucial step for domestic violence victims attempting to build a new
life.</TE>
<TE>   "The shelter is a 30-day program, but we often find there is a
great need for more time for women to be able to reestablish
themselves in society," said Lisette Rodriguez, a spokeswoman for the
Coalition to End Sexual and Domestic Violence. "Oftentimes, they have
left in the middle of the night with very little resources. And it
takes time to get back on their feet."</TE>
<TE>   There are a few facilities in the area that offer transitional
housing. Santa Barbara offers 14 one-bedroom apartments, and
Interface operates a five-family, six-month transitional housing
facility in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   But shelter operators say funding is too tight to make any
expansion plans for the near future. As nonprofits, the shelters rely
on state grants and donations for most of their budgets.</TE>
<TE>   "Funding is always an issue," Rodriguez said, adding that her
organization is still waiting to see how recent state budget cuts
will affect its budget. "We're waiting on pins and needles for the
word."</TE>

<HD>A Harder Path for O.C.'s Donors</HD>
<DH>Federal soft-money ban will force big spenders to send
contributions though different routes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Phil Willon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From Paul Goldenberg, "the king" of big-screen television salesmen,
to George Argyros, U.S. ambassador to Spain, Orange County's wealthy
citizens have lavished the national Republican and Democratic parties
with nearly $11 million in federal "soft money" donations over the
last dozen years, federal election records show.</LD>
<LD>   The gusher of local political cash, however, will soon dry up --
or be diverted -- because a federal campaign-finance law passed this
year bans soft-money contributions after Tuesday's election.</LD>
<LD>   Leading the pack of Orange County donors is real estate developer
Roland Arnall, chairman of Ameriquest Capital Corp. in Orange. In
defiance of Orange County's reputation as a Republican bastion, he
has donated all of it to Democrats -- more than $1.2 million since
1991.</LD>
<TE>   Arnall's political generosity far outweighs that of the top GOP
donor -- the Irvine Co. and its owner, Donald Bren, who gave a
combined $810,726 to the Republican Party.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, there are Democrats here in Orange County," said Frank
Barbaro, chairman of the Democratic Party of Orange County. "It's
traditionally been a stopover for fund-raisers from all over the
United States, certainly for the Republicans, but for the Democrats
as well. We have many well-heeled individuals here in Orange County."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, since 1991 the amount of soft money given to Republicans
-- about $5.8 million -- by Orange County donors is nearly matched by
the amount given to Democrats: about $4.9 million. The total
contributions do not include money donated to other parties.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the soft-money ban, some of Orange County's top donors
say they may funnel their money to state and local political parties,
which can still accept unlimited donations. But others may just keep
their checkbooks closed.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly would be a nice thing for my bank account. I'll be
dollars ahead," said Robert E. McDonough of Capistrano Beach, founder
of Remedy Temps, a national staffing agency with annual revenue of
about $550 million.</TE>
<TE>   McDonough, who has contributed $693,000 to the Democratic National
Committee and its affiliated organizations since 1991, said he
doesn't really feel like dealing with all the new rules.</TE>
<TE>   $10.8 Million Given</TE>
<TE>   Altogether, Orange County donors have forked over $10.8 million in
soft-money contributions since 1991, the first year national parties
were required to disclose all donations, Federal Election Commission
records show.</TE>
<TE>   Essentially unregulated, soft-money contributions have been
criticized for years by election reform advocates such as Sen. John
McCain (R-Ariz.), who made campaign-finance reform the cornerstone of
his 2000 presidential campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the flood of money has polluted the political process
and called it a mammoth loophole that has allowed corporations,
unions and individuals to sidestep contribution limits.</TE>
<TE>   For example, an individual donor is prohibited from giving a
federal candidate more than $1,000 per election cycle but is allowed
to give a national party committee $1 million or more, which could be
used to influence the race.</TE>
<TE>   Federal elections records show that the two major parties
collected more than $1.6 billion in soft-money contributions
nationwide since 1991. The money can be used for a variety of
purposes -- to bankroll television ads, voter drives and other
campaigning -- as long as the parties don't use the money to directly
tout or attack a candidate.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign-finance reforms passed by Congress and signed by
President Bush in July prohibit national parties and federal
officials and candidates from raising or spending soft money.</TE>
<TE>   The law takes effect Wednesday but is being challenged in court by
a variety of political parties and interest groups.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the law will have some effect. It will limit the impact
of soft money on the national races," said Larry Noble, executive
director of the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington, which
advocates election reform. "There are still loopholes -- I think one
of the effects will be that a lot of the contributors will get around
the reforms by directing their contribution to the state and local
parties."</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Erwin of the California Republican Party agreed that the
organization will probably receive some money that, before the
reforms were passed, would have gone to the national party. But, he
said, those same reforms handicap the state party's fund-raising
ability.</TE>
<TE>   "It will dramatically change how we can raise money. Federal
officials can no longer raise money for state parties. That includes
members of Congress and the president -- some of the most effective
fund-raisers," Erwin said.</TE>
<TE>   The new federal law also restricts the National Republican Party
from transferring funds to the state parties -- taking away the
California Republican Party's largest donor, Erwin said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, so long as politicians reign in Washington, America's
corporations and wealthy will offer generous donations in hopes that
they will gain access and possibly influence over policy decision,
Noble said.</TE>
<TE>   "That won't change," he said.</TE>
<TE>   PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. of Santa Ana, the nation's largest
supplier of Medicare health plans, has had a major interest in
several hot issues in Washington, including proposals for HMO and
Medicare reform, prescription drug benefits for seniors and
patient-bill-of-rights legislation.</TE>
<TE>   The company contributed $580,196 in soft money since 1991, divided
between the Republican and Democratic parties. PacifiCare officials
did not respond to inquires about the company' political
contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Supporting Agenda</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Holloway, spokesman for the Aliso Viejo-based Fluor Corp.,
another top Orange County donor, said the company uses contributions
to support politicians who advocate the pro-business agenda and
policies the company favors.</TE>
<TE>   The mammoth construction and engineering company and its
affiliates have made $798,777 in soft-money contributions to both
major parties since 1991, federal records show. The company also has
been awarded hundreds of millions of dollars worth of federal
government contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Holloway said its donations help give Fluor a voice in Washington
on critical issues that vary from tort reform to international trade
laws, all of which affect the company's ability to compete and serve
clients worldwide. Under the reforms, the company will probably focus
more on contributing directly to candidates rather than the national
parties, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not looking at a huge amount of money that's being
impacted. It might mean an increase in support to the local races,"
Holloway said.</TE>
<TE>   For Orange County's top individual donors, the soft-money
contributions are less about pushing a specific legislative agenda
than espousing their political philosophy.</TE>
<TE>   "I give to the Democrats because I think they're closer in touch
with people," said McDonough. "I think they do more for the general
population -- more so than Republicans, who say cut taxes and
nevermind about schools and hospitals."</TE>
<TE>   Being a well-heeled donor and longtime party supporter also can
bring rewards.</TE>
<TE>   Arnall, the county's top donor and a longtime Democratic
fund-raiser, had Gov. Gray Davis officiate at his wedding.
Goldenberg, the La Habra TV retailer who for years has crowed, "I am
the king!" on radio and television ads, once sipped coffee at the
Clinton White House.</TE>
<TE>   And Orange County developer George Argyros, who -- along with his
wife and his companies -- has given the Republican party $751,096 in
soft money since 1991, was appointed ambassador to Spain shortly
after President Bush took office.</TE>
<TE>   Still, though large donations can open both eyes and doors within
the nation's insular political circles, they often go unnoticed by
voters, said Barbaro.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody gives money to Gray Davis, Loretta Sanchez or Joe Dunn,
that's big news locally. Someone writes a check for $900,000 to the
National Democratic Party, nobody knows about it," said Barbaro,
chairman of the county Democratic party.</TE>
<TE>   "Now it's a new game. I think it's going to go a long way to
ending the influences of special interests. Of course, they are going
to scramble around a try to find a new way around it."</TE>

<HD>Secessionists Ponder Life After Election Day</HD>
<DH>Some Hollywood and Valley candidates say they'll mend
fences with L.A. if breakup loses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sharon Bernstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the election just one day away, some proponents of San Fernando
Valley and Hollywood secession are laying the groundwork for life
after Nov. 5 -- whether or not the ballot measures pass.</LD>
<LD>   If secession wins, backers will be busy setting up their new
cities. The winners of secession offices -- there are 122 hopefuls
for 20 positions in the two areas -- will be preparing to take their
places as city council members and, in the Valley's case, mayor. But
what happens to secessionists if the proposals, measures F and H on
Tuesday's ballot, lose?</LD>
<LD>   Some vow to fight again, saying they'll bring forward future
secession proposals or take their case to the courts.</LD>
<TE>   But many are building bridges to the City Hall with which they had
hoped to cut ties, planning quietly to invite campaign foes to
post-election meetings to make amends. Others are seeking to further
new political alliances developed as part of the cityhood campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Laurette Healey, co-chairwoman of the San Fernando Valley
Independence Committee, is urging fellow activists to position
themselves now for the possibility that secession could lose, so that
the issues raised in the campaign for smaller, more responsive
government remain alive after Election Day.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to see the baby thrown out with the bath water,"
Healey said. "These issues must prevail beyond the election,
regardless of whether an independent city is formed."</TE>
<TE>   Mel Wilson, who is running for mayor of the proposed Valley city,
said that, if the cityhood effort fails, he will continue to push its
broader agenda as part of a new group, made up mostly of business
leaders, called Alliance for a New Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I have not been one to be hostile to the mayor," Wilson said.
"I've not been calling people bloated and bureaucratic and all that
... You don't see me beating them up and trying to make them into the
enemy."</TE>
<TE>   One way secessionists in both Hollywood and the Valley hope that
their issues -- and for some, their political careers -- will survive
a possible loss Nov. 5 is through coalitions formed during the
breakaway effort.</TE>
<TE>   "The power structure within this town has shifted," said Ferris
Wehbe, the chief petitioner for the Hollywood secession effort. "We
have new folks that are involved, and they are going to be listened
to."</TE>
<TE>   New alliances abound among secession proponents, said a former
Assemblywoman and Valley city council candidate, Paula Boland, who
plans to run for a Los Angeles City Council seat if secession fails.</TE>
<TE>   "It has crossed party lines and socioeconomic lines," said Boland,
who, if secession fails, will seek the 12th District seat being
vacated by Councilman Hal Bernson next spring.</TE>
<TE>   Members of several alliances of candidates, including Valley
Liberals, Valley Women and United Valley Candidates, said their
organizations would continue as activist groups after the election.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Svonkin, one of the few Valley city council candidates with
significant financial backing and endorsements from elected
officials, said his goal if secession loses is to be the top
vote-getter in his district, which includes Studio City and Sherman
Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   If he does finish first, Svonkin hopes that city officials and
local activists will view him as a leader in his community and he
will be well positioned for a possible future political run.</TE>
<TE>   Svonkin is not the only one vying for a place in what some have
jokingly termed the Valley's "government-in-exile" -- to be made up
of the top vote-getters in the 14 council districts and the Valley
mayor's race, assuming secession loses and the offices thus fail to
exist.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Richman, a Northridge Republican, is running for mayor and
reelection to the state Assembly at the same time. If he becomes the
Valley's mayor-in-exile, Richman, who has greater name recognition
than his competitors, says he plans to continue to pursue a role as a
regional leader.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether a Valley city comes about or doesn't come about, we are
still going to need to work together for a better quality of life for
the residents of our area," Richman said.</TE>
<TE>   It is difficult to tell, however, how accommodating secession
opponents will be if the measure fails. City Council members,
particularly those who represent the Valley, Hollywood and even the
harbor area, where a secession proposal is still under evaluation,
have said that they would include secessionists in future endeavors
and continue to address the issues that breakaway proponents have
raised.</TE>
<TE>   "We really have an obligation to improve the way the city does
business," said Councilwoman Wendy Greuel, who supports reorganizing
L.A.'s government into boroughs to give neighborhoods more control
over services.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel, who represents the East Valley, said she would consider
appointing secession proponents to city commissions.</TE>
<TE>   It is less clear whether Mayor James K. Hahn will be friendly to
the secessionists.</TE>
<TE>   After the election, Hahn plans to invite secession supporters to
participate in neighborhood councils, pitching the newly formed
community groups as the best way to influence decisions at City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   But that is a far cry from putting the movement's leaders on city
commissions and inviting them to brainstorm about the city's future.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the question of victory itself, the vote tallies tomorrow
might help determine how much sway City Hall feels obligated to give
secession backers after the election.</TE>
<TE>   To win, the proposals must attract majorities in both the
secession regions as well as in the city at large.</TE>
<TE>   Polls have shown a close race in the Valley. "Winning in the
Valley is the only way to hold on to political capital" in the event
of a loss, said Richard Katz, co-chairman of the San Fernando Valley
Independence Committee. "We're still in the fight."</TE>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>The former king, Mohammad Zaher Shah, inaugurated a special committee
Sunday to draft a new Afghan Constitution.</LD>
<LD>   The nine-member committee, headed by Vice President Nematullah
Shahrani, will prepare a preliminary draft and submit it to a
constitutional commission. The final draft is expected to be approved
by a constitutional loya jirga, or grand council, next year.</LD>
<LD>   Appointing a commission to draft a new constitution was one of the
key tasks for President Hamid Karzai's administration, which was
named to an 18-month term in June. Zaher Shah, 88, returned this year
after three decades in exile in Italy.</LD>
<TE>   In another step forward Sunday, the government announced that it
had abolished the overnight curfew in Kabul because security has
improved.</TE>
<TE>   The curfew had been in force in Kabul, in various forms, since
Soviet forces invaded the country in 1979. Until Sunday, drivers
caught at military checkpoints in the capital between midnight and
3:30 a.m. were stopped and forced to sleep in their cars by the
roadside.</TE>

<HD>General Values Alliance With Afghan Warlords</HD>
<DH>The stability provided by regional leaders in the absence
of a strong central government trumps allegations of rights abuses,
he says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Zucchino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BAGRAM AIR BASE, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>The U.S. military will continue to work closely with Afghan warlords,
despite allegations of human rights abuses, because they provide
stability and security in the absence of a strong central government,
the American commander in charge of coalition forces in Afghanistan
said over the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Army Lt. Gen. Dan McNeill said in an interview that he has urged
regional warlords to respect human rights and support the government
in the capital, Kabul. But until U.S. military trainers are able to
help build a viable national army, he said, warlords who helped the
U.S. topple the Taliban regime last winter will continue to receive
American support.</LD>
<LD>   McNeill's comments came after a Human Rights Watch report last
week accused Herat provincial Gov. Ismail Khan, an ethnic Tajik, of
condoning torture and other abuses against the Pushtun minority in
the five western provinces he controls. Other warlords who were
supplied with cash and weapons by U.S. forces during the campaign
against the Taliban and Al Qaeda also have been accused of human
rights violations in recent months.</LD>
<TE>   "For the near term, these regional leaders -- while they might
appear unsavory to some, and some accuse them of having sordid pasts
-- they are providing a degree of security and stability out and away
from Kabul," McNeill said inside the tented tactical operations
center at Bagram.</TE>
<TE>   In recent conversations with Khan and other warlords, McNeill
said, he has been assured that they support the U.S.-backed
government of President Hamid Karzai. He said they are supplying
militiamen for training by U.S. Special Forces troops as part of the
national army and have promised to disband their private militias
once the national force is deployed throughout the country.</TE>
<TE>   "As each day goes by and the central government gains strength and
the Afghan national army gains a few more trained soldiers, each of
them will see that their future lies in being not, as you call it, a
warlord," McNeill said, "but in being what I call a regional leader."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "I don't sense that any of them intend to break off a
chunk of this country and form a separate state and to protect it at
all costs. But without the central government being able to push out
a well-trained and disciplined and well-controlled army to their
locations, they are more inclined to hang on to" their private
armies.</TE>
<TE>   In the hourlong interview, McNeill said the U.S. might be able to
begin reducing the number of troops in Afghanistan within 18 months
to two years, provided progress continues on eliminating Al Qaeda and
Taliban holdouts and building the Afghan army.</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledged that Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters have found
sanctuary in lawless Pushtun tribal areas in neighboring Pakistan,
but he said the U.S. will continue to rely on Pakistan rather than
send in U.S. troops to root out terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   McNeill, a three-star general, also said he has been assured by
the Pentagon that he will continue to be given sufficient resources
in Afghanistan if the Bush administration decides to attack Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Warlords are a contentious issue in Afghanistan, a tribal nation
with no history of a strong central government or national army. Khan
and others use private armies to collect import duties and other
taxes that otherwise would go to the central government, as well as
to extort money and crush political opposition. Many profit directly
from Afghanistan's lucrative opium and arms trades.</TE>
<TE>   But the same warlords -- among them Khan in the west, Abdul Rashid
Dostum in the north, Gul Agha Shirzai in the south and Hazrat Ali in
the east -- proved to be valuable allies in the war against the
Taliban and Al Qaeda. U.S. commanders developed close relationships
with them that continue to flourish. In the cities of Herat,
Jalalabad, Kandahar and Bamian, U.S. Special Forces soldiers live in
compounds provided by warlords and guarded by their gunmen.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, U.S. civil affairs soldiers are providing basic
medical and humanitarian assistance in the warlords' areas of
control, enhancing these leaders' credentials among the local
population. In most cases, the civil affairs officers are also
protected by the warlords' gunmen.</TE>
<TE>   McNeill sidestepped questions about human rights allegations
against Khan, speaking instead of warlords in general.</TE>
<TE>   In a series of interviews in Herat earlier this year, Khan did not
directly deny that his men had abused Pushtuns. But he pointed out
that the Pushtun-dominated Taliban committed atrocities against
Tajiks, and suggested that any abuses committed by his men against
Pushtuns were motivated by vengeance and thus to be expected.</TE>
<TE>   McNeill, asked about the future of U.S. troops in Afghanistan,
said they will remain at close to present levels (about 8,000) until
two primary goals have been achieved: the removal of remaining
Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters and the establishment of a viable
national army.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a rather large presence here now," he said. "In a year
and a half to two years, you'll still need some presence, but I doubt
you'd need as large a presence as you have today."</TE>
<TE>   McNeill added that U.S. forces will probably remain in Afghanistan
at sharply reduced levels for years to come.</TE>
<TE>   A key to reducing the U.S. military role here is the elimination
of Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters in western Pakistan, where Pushtun
tribes rule and the Pakistani government has little influence.
Soldiers with the 82nd Airborne Division, which is conducting combat
sweeps along the border, have expressed frustration that the enemy
uses Pakistan as a haven from which to move weapons, explosives and
fighters into and out of Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Under military rules of engagement, U.S. conventional forces in
Afghanistan cannot enter Pakistan unless they are attacked by enemy
forces fleeing into Pakistan or firing from inside the country. Al
Qaeda and Taliban fighters rarely engage U.S. forces, relying instead
on rocket attacks and land mines.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan uses poorly equipped and unreliable militiamen to patrol
the border region, although U.S. Special Forces troops, along with
CIA and FBI agents, are reported to be working inside Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   McNeill said Pakistan has done a good job of arresting Al Qaeda
operatives and cooperating with U.S. and coalition forces.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope to continue to work closely with them so that by the two
of us working closely together, especially in the common border area,
there will be some synergy in this and we will be more effective
perhaps than in the past," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether he was frustrated at not being able to attack an
enemy hiding just a few miles across the border, the general replied:
"I'm a good soldier, and I follow the last order first. I don't let
myself get frustrated."</TE>

<HD>New Delhi Police Kill 2 Terrorist Suspects</HD>
<DH>Authorities say men probably were planning attack on mall
filled with holiday shoppers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI</DL>
<LD>Police killed two suspected Islamic militants in a shootout Sunday at
a crowded shopping mall in India's capital, and authorities said the
men had probably been planning a terrorist attack.</LD>
<LD>   The shootout came during the country's busiest shopping weekend of
the year as Hindus prepared to celebrate Diwali, or the Festival of
Lights.</LD>
<LD>   The attackers were "Pakistanis, according to information available
now," said Deputy Prime Minister Lal Krishna Advani, adding that the
suspects had intended to provoke religious clashes.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier, police said they had been tipped off that militants
demanding independence for the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir
would target shopping malls or crowded areas during Diwali.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the two men, who were killed in the underground
parking lot of the mall, Ansal Plaza, were suspected members of the
Pakistani-based Lashkar-e-Taiba group. India blamed that group and
another organization for an attack on its Parliament building in
December.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they recovered two Chinese-made pistols, an AK-56
rifle and spare ammunition clips from the men.</TE>
<TE>   Had the men carried out an attack, the repercussions could have
been grave. The incident occurred in a wealthy area of New Delhi at
the most joyful time of year, a long holiday weekend filled with
parties, gift-giving and fireworks displays. Diwali marks the victory
of Rama, the most revered Hindu deity, over the demon king Ravana.</TE>
<TE>   "They hit the poshest mall in Delhi," a Western diplomat said.
"Anyone doing any last-minute shopping would be there. Just think of
the comparison -- an attack on a major shopping mall in the U.S. or
Europe on Christmas Eve. It could have been disastrous. It's a
worrying development."</TE>
<TE>   Security officials say there are concerns that militants might try
to carry out headline-grabbing attacks to focus attention on the
disputed Kashmir region.</TE>

<HD>Netanyahu Accepts Job--Conditionally</HD>
<DH>Israeli ex-premier says he'll take post as foreign minister
if Sharon holds early elections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Benjamin Netanyahu, one of Israel's best-known and most popular
politicians, said Sunday that he was willing to accept the job of
foreign minister in Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's government but
imposed a stringent condition: early elections.</LD>
<LD>   In complex political negotiations being conducted in an unusually
public forum, Netanyahu told longtime rival Sharon -- and the entire
country -- that the prime minister should face the voters early next
year and seek to increase the number of parliament seats he controls,
rather than woo small parties to try to keep a narrow governing
coalition together.</LD>
<LD>   Sharon's 20-month partnership with the center-left Labor Party
collapsed last week, leaving him scrambling to find new parliamentary
allies and fill key posts at a time when Israel is locked in combat
with the Palestinians and a potential U.S. war with Iraq is on the
horizon.</LD>
<TE>   Sharon has turned to right-wing figures as the mainstays of his
new Cabinet, picking retired army chief Shaul Mofaz as defense
minister and offering the Foreign Ministry to Netanyahu, who served
as prime minister from 1996 to 1999 and had been expected to
challenge Sharon for leadership of their conservative Likud Party in
advance of the next elections.</TE>
<TE>   Elections do not have to be held until a year from now, but
Netanyahu bluntly advised Sharon against trying to preside for that
long over an unstable coalition that would be beset by the competing
demands of small factions.</TE>
<TE>   "I told the prime minister I would be glad to serve in a
government going to early elections, because if we don't, the
government ... will be subject to endless blackmailing," he said in
an interview on Israel's Channel One television.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon neither accepted nor rejected Netanyahu's demand, saying in
a statement that it was "being examined." The two men had met twice
in three days and were expected to continue their talks today.</TE>
<TE>   Early elections were not Sharon's first choice when his alliance
with Labor collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   The prime minister indicated last week that he wanted to try to
cobble together a new coalition and continue, at least for the time
being, to govern with it. His aides have been holding talks with
ultranationalist and religious parties to try to recruit the six
seats he needs to regain a majority in the 120-seat Knesset.</TE>
<TE>   Netanyahu said he believed that the Likud Party would more than
double its parliamentary seats if early elections were held. Since
the outbreak of the Palestinian intifada, or uprising, more than two
years ago, polls have consistently pointed to a high degree of
support among Israelis for Likud's hard line toward the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's courting of Netanyahu has been widely seen by analysts
and commentators as an attempt to stave off a challenge from him for
the Likud leadership. Netanyahu, in an unusually revealing depiction
of the back-room deal taking shape, confirmed that defusing their
rivalry had been a prime issue in their talks.</TE>
<TE>   He suggested to Sharon that the two pledge to cooperate with each
other in party leadership primaries and in the next government, his
office said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians have been watching Sharon's Cabinet-building efforts
with alarm, fearing a lurch to the right as the jobs of outgoing
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994,
and Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, Labor's leader, are
offered to conservative counter- parts.</TE>
<TE>   Both Mofaz and Netanyahu have advocated expelling Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat, a step that would probably bring
strong international objections.</TE>
<TE>   Israel, meanwhile, came under sharp criticism Sunday in a report
to be released officially today by the London-based human rights
group Amnesty International. The document asserts that there is
"clear evidence" that some acts committed by the Israeli military
during a sweeping offensive in the West Bank last spring were war
crimes.</TE>

<HD>Quake Hits Pakistan, Killing 10</HD>
<DH>Magnitude 4.5 tremor is an aftershock. Several homes in
four northern villages are destroyed.</DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>A moderate earthquake jolted northern Pakistan on Sunday, killing at
least 10 people and injuring 48, many of them critically, officials
said.</LD>
<LD>   The magnitude 4.5 quake hit near Gilgit, about 125 miles northeast
of Islamabad, the capital, said Chaudhry Mehmood Arif, an official at
the seismic center in the northwestern city of Peshawar.</LD>
<LD>   The tremor was an aftershock from quakes Saturday that shook the
town of Skardu, 75 miles southeast of Gilgit, Arif said.</LD>
<TE>   Four villages, with a total population of 1,500, were most
affected by the tremors, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Several homes were destroyed, and 10 bodies were found in the
rubble, they said.</TE>
<TE>   However, the remoteness of the region made it difficult to quickly
assess the full extent of the damage.</TE>
<TE>   The Pakistani military removed many of the injured by helicopter
after landslides blocked the only road leading to the quake site.</TE>
<TE>   Emergency personnel were sent to the area to try to provide
temporary shelter for those whose homes were destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   The temblors also damaged a portion of the highway that runs the
length of Pakistan and into China.</TE>

<HD>Russia to Get Tougher in Chechnya</HD>
<DH>Moscow vows 'targeted operations' to stymie terrorism.
Meanwhile, rebels reportedly shoot down a copter, killing nine
soldiers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Holley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Russian Defense Minister Sergei B. Ivanov on Sunday announced
stepped-up military action in Chechnya in a bid to crush rebel plans
for "new terrorist acts" like the recent mass hostage seizure at a
Moscow theater that ended in huge loss of life.</LD>
<LD>   Shortly after he spoke, the reality of the war in the separatist
republic hit again with reports that Chechen fighters had shot down a
Russian military helicopter, killing nine soldiers.</LD>
<LD>   "In recent days, we keep getting more and more information that on
the territory of Chechnya -- and not only there -- new terrorist acts
are being prepared," Ivanov told reporters. "In some villages, the
recruiting of suicidal mercenaries is underway." He labeled the
recruits zombies.</LD>
<TE>   In response, Russian forces "will engage in large-scale and tough
but at the same time targeted operations aimed at preventing and
nipping such threats in the bud," Ivanov said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that plans for a possible reduction of Russian troops in
Chechnya, which he announced this summer, will be put on hold.</TE>
<TE>   The get-even-tougher policy in the war-shattered region comes as
many residents of Chechnya already fear a worsening of violence from
a Russian backlash against the theater takeover, which ended in the
deaths of at least 119 of the more than 750 hostages. Nearly all died
from a gas used to overcome most of the armed hostage-takers before
police stormed the theater. About 50 rebels who seized the theater
during the performance of a musical were also killed.</TE>
<TE>   "The capture of hostages in Moscow was absolutely against the
interests of the Chechen people," Khas-Magomed Edelkhanov, 51, a
Chechen farmer, said Sunday. "This operation 'proved' to the rest of
the world the official propaganda lies of the Kremlin that Chechens
are mostly bandits and terrorists rather than peaceful citizens.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is tense and worried," Edelkhanov went on. "People are
afraid that any day now, cruel 'mopping-up' operations will begin
again all over Chechnya and no one will say a protective word for us
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Chechens won a degree of autonomy for their republic in the
Caucasus region after defeating Russian troops in a 1994-96 war. But
Moscow's forces marched back into the republic in 1999 and have
battled guerrillas there since.</TE>
<TE>   The helicopter brought down Sunday was hit by a rebel rocket fired
from a movable launcher positioned in a ruined five-story building on
the outskirts of the Chechen capital, Grozny, Russian authorities
said. Soldiers were reported to have cordoned off and swept the area,
killing two separatist fighters.</TE>
<TE>   Pavel Felgenhauer, an independent defense analyst in Moscow,
questioned Sunday whether any effort at new, tougher tactics can
produce a military solution to the conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "They have been trying to achieve this for several years now with
basically zero success," Felgenhauer said. "Ivanov's statement to the
effect that the army will from now on resort to some kind of tough
but targeted sort of pinpoint blows makes me think only of more
massive bombing and rocket strikes."</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the theater seizure, however, polls show a clear
toughening of the Russian public's attitudes toward the Chechen
conflict.</TE>
<TE>   A survey conducted at the end of September by the All-Russian
Center for Public Opinion Research showed that 34% of respondents
favored a continuation of military operations in Chechnya, while 57%
supported the opening of peace negotiations. At the end of October,
after the theater hostages' deaths, support for military action
jumped to 46%, while just 44% supported starting negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander I. Zhilin, a defense analyst for the weekly Moskovskiye
Novosti, said that "right now, the climatic conditions in the North
Caucasus are good for targeted bombing operations against hidden
rebel bases in the mountains, now that the foliage is falling."</TE>
<TE>   But military action in Chechnya would be more successful, he
added, if President Vladimir V. Putin cracked down on "the corrupt
powerful clans in Russia at large and in the government in
particular" who have been enjoying "huge profits" made on trade in
illegal arms and in the "uncontrolled extraction and processing of
oil in Chechnya."</TE>
<TE>   "He needs not only to step up special operations in Chechnya while
the weather conditions are good for that and public support is on the
rise again -- he also needs to simultaneously step up a struggle
against corruption at all levels of Russian government and the power
structure," Zhilin said. "Without that, Chechnya will forever remain
an insatiable black hole sucking up lives, funds and hopes."</TE>

<HD>No Aid for a U.S. Attack, Saudi Says</HD>
<DH>Traditional ally won't let bases or airspace be used in any
move against Iraq, official declares.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Esther Schrader</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Saudi Arabia will not permit bases on its soil to be used in an
attack against Iraq, its northern neighbor, and will not grant
flyover rights to U.S. military planes even if the United Nations
sanctions an invasion, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al Faisal
said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The remarks by the prince on CNN were the strongest Saudi
rejection to date of any assistance to a possible U.S. attack on
Iraq. Although the Pentagon says the U.S. is able to launch such an
attack without Saudi assistance, military officials agree that having
to do so would constrain the strategic options open to war planners.</LD>
<LD>   Currently, more than 5,000 U.S. troops are based in Saudi Arabia,
and the country is bristling with U.S. military equipment and
weaponry. Nearly 12 years ago, an American base near Riyadh, the
Saudi capital, was a launch pad for the U.S.-led Persian Gulf War,
which drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait after a seven-month
occupation.</LD>
<TE>   The same base played a critical role in last year's campaign to
drive the Taliban from power in Afghanistan. At the facility, Air
Force commanders orchestrated many of the airstrikes against the
Taliban and Al Qaeda, while vast teams of U.S. military computer
specialists and other experts also made Riyadh their home.</TE>
<TE>   "We can live without Saudi bases, but it obviously makes it
tougher," one military official said Sunday. "If they don't at least
give us flyover rights, it's going to be a lot more complex moving
supplies and people over there."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if Saud's comments marked a serious military setback to any
U.S.-led effort against Iraq, Mary Matalin, counselor to Vice
President Dick Cheney, said on CNN's "Late Edition" that other allies
in the region would fill the gap if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "We have many friends and allies in the region, and we have many
friends and allies around the world," Matalin said. "... We would
never engage unless we were sure that we could get the job done
well."</TE>
<TE>   Saudi officials have gone back and forth for months on the issue
of basing rights for U.S. forces in the event of an invasion of Iraq
-- most recently saying that the United States could use the bases if
the attack was sanctioned by the U.N. -- and they had left the window
open on allowing U.S. combat, reconnaissance or refueling planes to
land on Saudi soil.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, however, Saud appeared to take Saudi opposition further.</TE>
<TE>   "We will cooperate with the Security Council, but as to entering
the conflict or using the facilities as part of the conflict, that is
something else," Saud said when asked about allowing overflights by
U.S. forces.</TE>
<TE>   "Our policy is that if the United Nations takes a decision on
Chapter 7, it is obligatory on all signatories to cooperate -- but
that is not to the extent of using facilities in the country or the
military forces of the country," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter mandates that members of the world
body implement any measure immediately as part of international law.</TE>
<TE>   Pressed about whether the Saudi bases could be used, he gave a
definite "No."</TE>
<TE>   It was not clear what prompted the apparent shift in the Saudi
position.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon is considerably less dependent on Saudi assistance
than it was during the Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   Then, Kuwait was occupied by the Iraqi army. This time, the
emirate would be a major base for American troops and equipment. And
faced with possible Saudi opposition to a war against Iraq, the
United States has poured $1.4 billion into expanding Qatar's Al Udeid
facility into a major air base and military staging ground.</TE>
<TE>   Equipment for two reinforced Army armored brigades is already
stored in 37 huge warehouses in Kuwait and Qatar. Each country holds
in storage about 115 M-1A1 Abrams tanks, 60 M-2A2 Bradley fighting
vehicles, 100 armored personnel carriers, 25 mortars and 20
155-millimeter howitzers.</TE>
<TE>   Equipment for another armored brigade from the Army and one from
the Marine Corps is afloat on ships in the region.</TE>
<TE>   But Pentagon war planners continue to believe that Saudi Arabia's
public opposition in recent months to the use of U.S. bases on its
soil is mainly diplomatic posturing.</TE>
<TE>   Every Persian Gulf government has publicly objected to an invasion
of Iraq, but several, including Saudi Arabia, have allowed U.S.
military forces to make war preparations on their territory.</TE>
<TE>   "When push comes to shove, some arrangement will be worked out
with Saudi Arabia," said MIT military analyst Owen Cote.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia has been a strategic U.S. ally for more than half a
century, but ties were severely strained by last year's Sept. 11
attacks on the United States, in which 15 of the 19 men believed to
be the suicide hijackers were Saudis; by the possibility of a U.S.
attack on Iraq; and by American support for Israel in its ongoing
conflict with the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   The Saudi foreign minister said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
fate should be decided by the Iraqi people and warned against a
long-term U.S. military presence in Iraq -- an idea floated by some
Bush administration officials in the last few weeks. There have been
suggestions that Army Gen. Tommy Franks, who led the war in
Afghanistan, or one of his subordinates might take on the role held
by Army Gen. Douglas MacArthur in Japan, where he oversaw the
occupation government from 1945 to 1951 and helped to reform the
country's political, social and economic institutions.</TE>
<TE>   "History tells us that whatever change you believe you can bring
to the country that you occupy, you can never make a permanent change
through occupation by a foreign force in the country," Saud said.</TE>
<TE>   "Iraq is not Japan. Saddam Hussein is not the Emperor Hirohito,
and I don't know if the general ... is going to be MacArthur."</TE>

<HD>Moderate Islamic Party Wins Vote in Turkey</HD>
<DH>The AKP is widely held to espouse Western democratic
values, but some worry about a showdown with the pro-secular
military.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeffrey Fleishman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ANKARA, Turkey</DL>
<LD>Propelled by voter anger over a two-year economic crisis, a populist
party with Islamist roots easily won Sunday's national elections
here, sweeping a corrupt government from power and igniting fears of
a potential showdown with a staunchly secular military.</LD>
<LD>   Unofficial results showed the Justice and Development Party, or
AKP, winning 34.2% of the vote -- enough to control parliament and a
clear sign of the contempt Turks feel for an era of infighting and
economic turmoil brought about by coalition governments.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the nation's 41 million voters probably spoke with their
pocketbooks, not their religious convictions.</LD>
<TE>   But the religious overtones were apparent. Widely described as a
moderate Islamic party espousing Western democratic principles, the
AKP is coming to power as Turkey is pushing for European Union
membership and as the U.S. eyes this nation's air bases for a
possible war against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The Turkish military, the protector of the secular constitution,
is wary that the party might tug the country east, away from an
80-year struggle to join the West.</TE>
<TE>   According to the unofficial results, the AKP's main rival -- the
Republican People's Party, or CHP -- won 19.4% of the vote. It was
the only other party to pass the 10% threshold required to enter
parliament. The Democratic Left Party of Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit, blamed for the nation's economic collapse and an estimated
20% unemployment rate, received only 1.3% of the ballots. Official
results are expected by Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We committed suicide," said Ecevit, referring to the government's
decision to hold elections 18 months early for 550 parliament seats.
Ecevit's poor health was a main factor in the change.</TE>
<TE>   AKP leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan sought to defuse fears about his
party's religious intentions and emphasized Turkey's relationship
with Europe. In his victory remarks, Erdogan, the former mayor of
Istanbul, said: "The process of joining the European Union will be
speeded up," and Turkey "will follow economic programs to integrate
the country with the world."</TE>
<TE>   "The AKP will have to move quickly to establish ties with the
West," said a Western diplomat. "They have to sort of legitimize
themselves. If they have this majority and they attempt to use it to
change the constitution, they will undoubtedly have problems not only
with the military but also with businessmen and a huge portion of the
country."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts predict that the Turkish military will not immediately
react to the AKP's landslide but will wait to see how firmly the
party holds to its pro-Western promises. In 1997, the military forced
the Islamic Welfare Party from power.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's victory was a testament to the AKP's organizational
ability and to Erdogan's dynamic personality. The party, which was
established in 2001 by lawmakers from a banned pro-Islamic party,
projected a folksiness that captured villages and hamlets scattered
across vast agricultural regions. It employed a more sophisticated
tone in the cities, where disillusioned professionals were eager for
change.</TE>
<TE>   Party officials bristled whenever the AKP was referred to as
Islamist, insisting that they would not abandon Turkey's North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and other pro-Western commitments. On
Sunday, Erdogan even said he would reluctantly support a strike on
Iraq if it was approved by the U.N.</TE>
<TE>   Drums echoed and horns blared outside AKP headquarters here in the
capital Sunday night. The party's yellow-and-blue flags snapped in a
strong wind, and men and women danced as vote tallies were announced.
Most have felt the sting of Turkey's recession. Many said the AKP's
strong showing revealed a steely desire by voters for new faces to
improve a country struggling to comply with a $31-billion recovery
plan from the International Monetary Fund.</TE>
<TE>   "Turkey has been going through disastrous times. It's not a
surprise the victory is so big," said Ahmet Tatlili, a political
science student who said his father, a meat salesman, has lost 40% of
his business over the last year. "None of the other parties can solve
these problems."</TE>
<TE>   Standing next to Tatlili was Mehmet Baykal, a pharmacist, who said
his business is down 50%. "We need the AKP to crack down on
corruption," he said. Baykal's wife, Deniz, had a different reason
for supporting the party. She wants the ban on wearing Islamic head
scarves in public buildings repealed so young observant Muslim women
can attend universities. "The law must be abolished," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Such sentiments anger CHP supporters such as Halil Pulat.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm shocked the AKP won a majority," he said as he walked past a
row of taverns in downtown Ankara. "It's clear that no matter what
they say, the AKP will try to introduce religious rule. First,
they'll allow head scarves, and then who knows?</TE>
<TE>   "For all our best efforts to reach out to the West, the West has
always seen us as Iran," Pulat added. "With an AKP victory, people in
the West will feel vindicated by that opinion."</TE>
<TE>   The AKP will be taking charge of the government with unresolved
problems of its own. Erdogan was jailed in 1999 for religious
sedition after publicly reciting a well-known poem the government
regards as radical. He was consequently banned from serving in the
government.</TE>
<TE>   Erdogan has exacerbated the dilemma by not yet naming a candidate
for prime minister from the party's ranks. Last week, Turkish
President Ahmet Necdet Sezer said he would step in and designate a
prime minister. Many of the AKP's critics, however, are concerned
that Erdogan will manipulate the government from behind the scenes.
They question his transformation from a mayor who banned alcohol in
Istanbul restaurants and opposed EU membership to a westward-leaning,
sound-bite-savvy party leader.</TE>
<TE>   But "the AKP will not be religious in office," said Bulent
Akarcali, a former member of parliament. "These guys are
Western-oriented. They're not fundamentalists."</TE>

<HD>Allies Find No Links Between Iraq, Al Qaeda</HD>
<DH>Evidence isn't there, officials in Europe say, adding that
an attack on Hussein would worsen the threat of terrorism by Islamic
radicals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sebastian Rotella</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>As the Bush administration prepares for a possible military attack on
Iraq that it describes as the next logical step in its war on terror,
some of its strongest front-line allies in that war dispute
Washington's allegations that the Baghdad regime has significant ties
to Al Qaeda.</LD>
<LD>   In recent interviews, top investigative magistrates, prosecutors,
police and intelligence officials who have been fighting Al Qaeda in
Europe said they are concerned about attempts by President Bush and
his aides to link Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to Osama bin Laden's
terror network.</LD>
<LD>   "We have found no evidence of links between Iraq and Al Qaeda,"
said Jean-Louis Bruguiere, the French judge who is the dean of the
region's investigators after two decades fighting Islamic and Middle
Eastern terrorists. "And we are working on 50 cases involving Al
Qaeda or radical Islamic cells. I think if there were such links, we
would have found them. But we have found no serious connections
whatsoever."</LD>
<TE>   Even in Britain, a loyal U.S. partner in the campaign against
Iraq, it's hard to find anyone in the government making the case that
Al Qaeda and the Iraqi regime are close allies. In fact, European
counter-terrorist veterans who are working with American counterparts
worry that an attack on Iraq, especially a unilateral U.S. invasion,
would worsen the threat of radical Islamic terrorism worldwide and
impede their work.</TE>
<TE>   "A war on Iraq will not diminish the terrorist threat. It will
probably increase it," said Baltasar Garzon, Spain's best-known
investigative magistrate, who is prosecuting Al Qaeda suspects in
Madrid as alleged accomplices in the Sept. 11 attacks. "It could
radicalize the situation in the Middle East.... As for the
investigations of Sept. 11, doors would close in the Arab world that
have helped in the fight against Al Qaeda. And a war would do nothing
to bolster the investigation into the attacks in the United States."</TE>
<TE>   The European critics aren't limited to the usual suspects:
instinctively anti-American, pro-Arab politicians and pundits whose
voices are often the loudest in the Iraq debate here. On the
contrary, Bruguiere, Garzon and other investigators have won praise
from U.S. officials for their tough tactics and proven willingness to
lock up suspected terrorists during the past year.</TE>
<TE>   Even before Sept. 11, long-running cases in Europe were valuable
resources for U.S. investigators working to learn more about Islamic
networks. Investigations in France, Spain and elsewhere have helped
build cases against Zacarias Moussaoui, an alleged accomplice of the
hijackers who awaits trial in Virginia, and other suspects.</TE>
<TE>   The criticism in Europe reinforces the misgivings of some U.S.
congressional leaders and intelligence officials about hawks in the
Bush administration who allege that Iraq could have even played a
role in the Sept. 11 attacks. Critics say that the evidence is weak
and that intelligence agencies are feeling political pressure to
implicate Iraq in terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   In the last two months, Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, Defense
Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and others have periodically revived and
expanded on the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Bush specifically linked Hussein to the terrorist
network. "We know he's got ties with Al Qaeda," Bush said during an
election rally in New Hampshire. "A nightmare scenario, of course, is
that he becomes the arsenal for a terrorist network, where they could
attack America and he'd leave no fingerprints behind. He is a
problem."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. leaders have made much of a supposed meeting between
Mohamed Atta, the leader of the Sept. 11 hijackers, and an Iraqi spy
in Prague, the Czech capital, last year. They have cited "bulletproof
evidence," in Rumsfeld's words, of the recent presence of Al Qaeda
members in Iraq and of contacts between senior Al Qaeda figures and
the Baghdad regime that allegedly go back years. They have accused
Iraq of training Al Qaeda terrorists in the use of chemical weapons.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Premise Called Flawed</TE>
<TE>   European experts say they haven't seen U.S. proof or been able to
confirm the accusations independently. The Europeans say the premise
is flawed because Hussein embodies the kind of secular Arab dictators
whom Bin Laden has sworn to bring down.</TE>
<TE>   Talk of an Iraq-Al Qaeda connection is "nonsense," said a
high-ranking source in the German intelligence community. "Not even
the Americans believe it anymore."</TE>
<TE>   The German government has resolutely opposed a potential war on
Iraq, partly out of domestic electoral calculations. And it has
angered Washington in the process. France has pursued a diplomatic
offensive to tone down a proposed U.S. resolution at the United
Nations mandating aggressive weapons inspections in Iraq, while
asserting that it could accept military action approved by the U.N.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Britain, Spain and Italy have indicated that they
would support a U.S.-led attack even if the U.N. process breaks down.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Spain's Garzon breaks ranks with his government when it comes
to Iraq. The famously independent judge considers himself a leftist
and has criticized the indefinite imprisonment of terrorism suspects
at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, although his anti-corruption probes and
battle against Basque separatist terrorists have made him enemies on
the left as well.</TE>
<TE>   "I have seen no link to Al Qaeda. No one has demonstrated it to
me," Garzon said. "And therefore we have to be very careful not to
confuse the citizens. One thing is that you don't like the Iraqi
regime, that Saddam Hussein is a dictator. But there are many
terrible dictators. That's not a reason to start a war with all the
consequences it could have for millions of innocents."</TE>
<TE>   Of all the intelligence services in the world, British agencies
probably work the closest with U.S. spies. The sharing of sensitive
information appeared evident in a British government dossier in
September that laid out charges about Hussein's program to develop
weapons of mass destruction. The report closely resembled
Washington's accounts of Iraq's arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   The British have been much quieter when it comes to any alliance
between Iraq and Al Qaeda, however. Asked about the matter Wednesday,
Foreign Secretary Jack Straw sounded diplomatic.</TE>
<TE>   "It could well be the case that there were links, active links,
between Al Qaeda and the Iraqi regime before Sept. 11," Straw said.
"What I'm asked is if I've seen any evidence of that. And the answer
is: I haven't."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No Prague Meeting</TE>
<TE>   Straw said there is some evidence of such links during the past
year but did not elaborate. And on a crucial point, he and his aides
made it clear that the allegations of a meeting in Prague between
Atta and an Iraqi intelligence agent -- Exhibit A for U.S. hawks who
accuse Hussein of having a hand in the Sept. 11 plot -- have been
disproved.</TE>
<TE>   In other countries with considerable expertise, investigators said
they have come across scattered examples of limited connections: An
Iraqi member of Al Qaeda turned up in an Italian case. There are
signs of Al Qaeda suspects moving through Iraq en route to other
countries before and after Sept. 11, according to Spanish and French
law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   But European investigators said the Al Qaeda presence is stronger
in Pakistan, Syria, Yemen and Iran than it is in Iraq. Since the war
in Afghanistan, Iran in particular has become a busy refuge for Bin
Laden's operatives, according to French investigators.</TE>
<TE>   And Saudi Arabia, officially a U.S. ally, has been deeply involved
in the worldwide funding mechanism that helps sustain Al Qaeda
operations as well as fundamentalist ideologues active in recruitment
of terrorists and the theology of violence, European investigators
said.</TE>
<TE>   "If connections to a country are going to be the rationale, the
Americans would have to bomb Saudi Arabia," a Spanish official said
sarcastically.</TE>
<TE>   Bruguiere, the French judge, took issue with the idea that an
invasion of Iraq would make the world safer from terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The main thing that Iraq and Al Qaeda have in common is enmity
toward the United States, according to Bruguiere and others. That is
not enough to create an alliance, but it could cause a resurgent Al
Qaeda to exploit a U.S. military operation that produced civilian
casualties and an extended occupation of Iraq, the same way Al Qaeda
uses the Palestinian-Israeli conflict to whip up resentment of the
West.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. military intervention in Iraq could "globalize
anti-American and anti-Western sentiment," Bruguiere said. "Attacking
Iraq would intensify Islamic terrorism, not reduce it."</TE>

<HD>Coffee Chief Stirs Unrest</HD>
<DH>The autocratic style of Farmer Bros.' longtime chairman has
left investors with a bitter aftertaste. It's a firm without a clear
future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Hirsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the conclusion of a recent annual meeting of Farmer Bros. Co., a
major stockholder made what he thought was a perfectly innocuous
request: Could he tour the coffee company's sprawling complex in the
industrial section of Torrance?</LD>
<LD>   Without looking up from the director's table, the company's
86-year-old chairman and chief executive, Roy F. Farmer, killed the
idea. "No tours," he snapped. "No tours for unhappy shareholders."</LD>
<LD>   As it turns out, more and more Farmer Bros. shareholders are
unhappy these days.</LD>
<TE>   It's not the financial performance of the company, which sells
coffee and other staples to restaurants and commercial food service
establishments in 29 states, that has people so upset, though its
results have faltered some of late. Nor is anyone accusing Roy
Farmer, who has made $4.8 million in salary, bonuses and other
benefits during the last three years, of mismanaging the business or
raiding company coffers for personal gain.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, with Farmer's health declining from prostate cancer and
other ailments, critics have become increasingly restless with his
autocratic style -- one that is strangely anachronistic in an age
when most corporate boards and executives are scrambling to show how
responsive they are to the concerns of outsiders.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholders want Farmer Bros. to add independent directors,
provide more financial information, talk to Wall Street analysts and
change its bylaws to loosen the grip that Roy Farmer has had on the
company for more than half a century. They question whether there is
a coherent succession plan for a corporation in which the average age
of its closely knit board of directors and top management team is in
the mid-60s.</TE>
<TE>   "His conduct is extraordinary," says Gary Lutin, an investment
banker and corporate governance activist working to force more
disclosure from Farmer Bros. "This is the only company I have come
across where they won't send you an annual report or return your
phone call. It is astonishing."</TE>
<TE>   Even Farmer's own kin are fuming. The chairman's 85-year-old
sister, Catherine Crowe, and her children have joined other major
shareholders to demand that the company divulge more information
about its operations and strategy and end Farmer's unofficial
corporate gag order.</TE>
<TE>   "We are frustrated," says Steven Crowe, Farmer's nephew. "Our
family owns 440,000 shares. That's about $150 million, and it is
controlled by people who won't even talk to us."</TE>
<TE>   Bradley Takahashi, a vice president of Franklin Mutual Advisors,
which owns 9.6% of Farmer Bros., says the chairman reminds him of the
curmudgeonly bank patriarch portrayed in the film "Mary Poppins."</TE>
<TE>   "When someone wants to a make a comment at the shareholders
meeting, Farmer barks, 'Stand up,' " says Takahashi, who was the one
shot down when he asked for a tour of operations. "And if he can't
hear, he yells, 'Come closer.' "</TE>
<TE>   Neither Farmer nor any of his executives would speak to The Times.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Passionately Committed</TE>
<TE>   But interviews with employees, family members and business
associates portray Farmer as a conservative businessman passionately
committed to maintaining his immediate family's control over the
company.</TE>
<TE>   "Many years ago, I called the company and found out that no one
gets to talk to Roy Farmer," says Alan Kahn, a New York investor and
longtime shareholder. "Roy Farmer is somewhat of an enigma."</TE>
<TE>   Over the last few years, the company's financial performance has
slipped. Sales peaked at $240 million in 1998 but have fallen to $206
million in its most recent fiscal year. Profit hit a record $37.6
million in fiscal 2000 but dropped 16% last year to $30.6 million.
The company says increased competition and the slow economy are
responsible for the declines.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Farmer Bros. shares have risen 19% since January,
impressive in a market where the major stock indexes have fallen 15%
to 30% in the same period. Factoring in dividends, shareholders have
earned a 43% return in the last 12 months. The company has a market
value of $607 million.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the stock's performance, Farmer Bros. is not a business
many outsiders buy into. It is a public company, but on average,
fewer than 1,000 of its nearly 2 million shares outstanding change
hands daily.</TE>
<TE>   Roy Farmer owns less than 10% of the company, but through his
control of family trusts, which include much of the Crowe family's
holdings, and the employee stock plan, his voting power approaches
50%.</TE>
<TE>   Associates speculate that Farmer never wanted to deal with
outsiders but was forced to when his father died at age 59, and he
was compelled to sell a portion of the company's stock to the public
in 1952 to cover estate taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Now, many say, Farmer is haunted by that decision.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it is his business or his personal life, Farmer carefully
avoids the spotlight. He has lived with his wife, Emily, in the same
home in Ladera Heights for at least 32 years, according to property
records. He avoids ostentatious spending and likes to keep his cars
-- Lincolns and Fords -- for a decade or more. The company doesn't
belong to the National Coffee Assn. or the Specialty Coffee Assn.,
the industry's trade groups.</TE>
<TE>   These days, the man who once effortlessly hauled 132-pound burlap
sacks of green coffee beans around the roasting plant and who
boasted, "Vacations are only for employees," rarely makes it to the
office.</TE>
<TE>   His strategy is simple: Buy low-cost beans, blend them into a
decidedly average cup of coffee, avoid debt and rapid growth and
communicate as little as possible with outsiders.</TE>
<TE>   Most business is conducted through Kenneth Carson, Farmer's vice
president of sales, or Guenter Berger, vice president of production,
say business associates, although his son Roy E. Farmer, 50, is
corporate president. The younger Farmer is the only one of the four
Farmer children active in the company, which has 1,113 employees.</TE>
<TE>   When Farmer Bros. does open itself to outsiders, it is once a year
at its annual shareholder meeting, and the sessions have an
atmosphere of an old-fashioned church social rather than a 21st
century corporate confab.</TE>
<TE>   "There were about 50 people at the last one I attended," recalls
Jim Mitchell, who runs an investment partnership in Costa Mesa that
has owned 1,200 shares since 1990. "Only two of us asked questions,
and at the end I realized everyone else was there for the food. It
was a buffet, a lot of jello salads and things you would expect to
see at a potluck."</TE>
<TE>   Farmer Bros.' logo is also a throwback. Its trucks and coffee cans
depict an award from the California State Fair given by the "Consumer
Reaction Council" in a taste test that was apparently taken in the
1960s, according to one executive.</TE>
<TE>   At the company's tan and brown headquarters, perched along a rail
spur in Torrance, a green mosaic mural depicting coffee industry
scenes -- the harvest and the unloading of coffee beans at the port
-- serves as decoration. Computers came to branch offices only in the
last eight years, according to former employees. There is no
corporate Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Although manufacturing coffee-brewing equipment is a critical
portion of Farmer's business, it is rarely the innovator and waits
until competitors come up with new designs and improvements before
making changes, according to former employees.</TE>
<TE>   In its annual report, the company doesn't list Starbucks Corp. as
a major competitor, even though the Seattle purveyor is moving
heavily into the food service and institutional accounts of the type
that make up the bread and butter of Farmer's business.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Crowe, the grandson of the company's founder, says he once
asked if Farmer Bros. should be concerned about the rapid growth of
Starbucks and its influence on the industry. A board member, he says,
told him Starbucks wasn't important.</TE>
<TE>   The roots of the family squabble go back two decades, when
Catherine Crowe launched a proxy battle to gain a board seat. Farmer
then rejected Steven Crowe's efforts to take over his mother's seat
after she resigned because of health problems.</TE>
<TE>   Farmer's father started the company in 1912, roasting beans and
selling them door to door. It entered the equipment business a decade
later and by the 1930s was in the food service business. Today, it
sells products such as coffee, stainless tableware, pancake mix and
individual packets of pickle relish.</TE>
<TE>   Ted Lingle, executive director of the Long Beach-based Specialty
Coffee Assn., says that early on the company understood how the
Western United States would grow, opening branches in key areas such
as San Francisco and Las Vegas. But the company has long lost its
interest in aggressive expansion. "Roy easily could have made Farmer
Bros. a national company," says Lingle, but he chose not to.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An Efficient Operation</TE>
<TE>   Still, Farmer Bros. is not devoid of business know-how and
technology. It has a continuous coffee-roasting and packaging system
that is regarded as one of the most efficient in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   People within the industry say the company probably will be sold
when Farmer dies, possibly to a giant such as Sara Lee Corp., which
has gobbled up similar family-run coffee companies and controls 25%
of the splintered food service market. Farmer Bros. is second or
third, with about a 5% share, Lingle says.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the activist shareholders are pitching incremental
change. In July, Mitchell submitted a shareholders' proposal asking
the company to elect a majority of independent directors. It also
seeks to reinstate the ability of shareholders to elect directors
through cumulative voting, a common balloting procedure that makes it
easier for shareholder groups to gain representation.</TE>
<TE>   The company refused to place Mitchell's proposals on the ballot at
the next annual meeting, expected to be held in two to three months.
After reviewing the matter, the Securities and Exchange Commission
issued a staff report recommending against taking any action against
Farmer Bros. That gives the company some breathing room, but not for
long. The corporate governance reform act signed by President Bush in
July and new Nasdaq rules will phase in all but the cumulative voting
provision of Mitchell's proposals.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC also is considering Franklin Mutual Advisors' bid to place
a proposal on the ballot that would force more financial disclosure
by Farmer Bros. The SEC has not ruled on that issue.</TE>
<TE>   Farmer's fractious relationship with Wall Street goes back
decades, but this latest battle erupted over what the company should
do with a $293-million cash hoard it has accumulated.</TE>
<TE>   Franklin is trying to use that pile of cash as a can opener of
sorts, forcing management to provide more information about how the
company is run. The mutual fund says the cash represents a large
enough portion of Farmer Bros.' assets that the company should be
classified as an investment firm and be forced to comply with
stricter disclosure regulations.</TE>
<TE>   "Essentially, this looks like an old coffee company that has
become a pile of cash and a small coffee company," says David
Winters, president of Franklin Mutual Advisors. Generally speaking,
he adds, a company with 40% or more of its assets in investment
securities and cash needs to adhere to the stricter disclosure rules.</TE>
<TE>   Farmer Bros. has told Franklin that it will open some of its
records -- but has not set a date.</TE>
<TE>   Although some shareholders would like to see Farmer Bros. pay out
its cash in the form of a giant dividend, others would like to see
the money put to use by growing the business through acquisitions or
expansion.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some legitimate questions to ask about Farmer, but the
answers won't all be that the management has done a poor job," says
James Lingle, Ted's brother and president of Lingle Bros. Coffee, a
competitor based in Bell Gardens. "Like all family businesses, it is
a whole lot easier from the outside looking in rather than actually
being there."</TE>

<DH>Bipolar disorder, often misdiagnosed as simple depression,
can worsen with antidepressants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Benedict Carey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The ideas come in a swarm, and they can be good ones: Move to Prague
and teach English. Study jazz piano in the early-morning hours. Start
a dot-com; hike the Appalachian Trail; write an opera.</LD>
<LD>   "I wanted to save people," said Agnes Zsigovics, 28, a student in
social work living near San Diego, who in her early 20s made plans
to teach children living in the mountains of Venezuela -- only to
ditch the idea at the last minute and fly to Montreal to teach
Spanish. "I just had way, way too many projects in my head.... I can
tell you this: People with bipolar disorder have the most interesting
lives."</LD>
<LD>   They can also have dangerous lives. Bipolar disorder is another
name for manic depression, an incurable, lifelong mental condition in
which people zigzag from these effusive emotional highs to paralyzing
periods of despair, often accompanied by thoughts of suicide. Recent
studies suggest that as many as 10 million Americans are afflicted
with the condition to some degree -- far more than previously
thought. The illness goes unnoticed or undiagnosed in many people
because their manic episodes are neither dramatic nor especially
destructive, psychiatrists report. The findings have prompted a wave
of research into new drug and talk therapies and an increased
willingness among psychiatrists to seek guidance from patients and
their families.</LD>
<TE>   "What we're learning is that patients do a lot better if they're
collaborating on their own treatment," Dr. Gary Sachs, lead
investigator of a large national study that is following about 2,500
patients with bipolar disorder and comparing treatment approaches.</TE>
<TE>   Preliminary evidence from the trial, sponsored by the National
Institute of Mental Health, suggests that patients are the best judge
of what triggers their manias and that their family and friends are
crucial allies in managing the disorder. "It's as if you're
co-managing a baseball team, working together to decide which
combination of drugs and therapy work best, and when," says Sachs,
director of the bipolar treatment program at Massachusetts General
Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   For half a century doctors have treated bipolar disorder with
regular doses of lithium carbonate, a naturally occurring mineral
that acts in many patients like a steady hand on the emotional
tiller. Though neurologists don't yet know how bipolar disorder
develops, the mood swings have been linked to tidal shifts in the
levels of chemical messengers in the brain, such as serotonin,
glutamate and dopamine, which help people experience emotions.
Lithium appears to calm these chemical waves, and in the process has
spared uncounted millions from suicidal thoughts. Actress Patty Duke,
in her autobiography "Call Me Anna," which describes her battle with
bipolar disorder, calls lithium her savior, a drug that rescued her
from probable suicide.</TE>
<TE>   People with untreated bipolar disorder are about 30 times more
likely to commit suicide than the overall population, in which 12 of
100,000 take their own lives. Even patients who receive treatment
experience frequent relapses, and many will plunge into drug and
alcohol abuse, or contemplate suicide, psychiatrists say. Often, the
relapse can be due to the treatment itself. Researchers at the New
York State Psychiatric Institute reported in June that about one of
every three bipolar patients who visited psychiatrists during the
1990s received no mood-stabilizing medication. Many got only
antidepressants. The problem is, while antidepressants may lift the
mood of someone with bipolar disorder, they also often propel them
into a manic episode and depressive rebound, accelerating their
cycles and making the problem worse, researchers and patients say.</TE>
<TE>   For all its power to dampen mood swings, lithium also fails to
prevent relapse in at least half of people with bipolar disorder,
according to Dr. Mark Rapaport, a psychiatric researcher at UC San
Diego.</TE>
<TE>   But in the last several years doctors have begun to
experiment with a variety of anticonvulsant drugs, which appear to be
effective at stabilizing mood swings, decreasing the frequency of
both depression and mania, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the federal study led by Sachs, researchers have found that the
suicide rate over two years is about half of what doctors would
expect to see in a group of bipolar patients receiving treatment.
Researchers attribute some of this improvement to the careful
attention patients are getting, which likely has a soothing effect.
Another possible factor is that about one in four patients is taking
lamotrigine, a drug used primarily to control seizures in people with
epilepsy. "This drug appears to be especially useful in preventing
people from relapsing into the depressive phase," Rapaport said.</TE>
<TE>   In other trials, drugs such as valproic acid (Depakote) and
olanzapine have also proved useful in some patients as mood
stabilizers.</TE>
<TE>   Drug treatments almost always work best when combined with some
form of psychotherapy, doctors said. For starters, a good therapist
makes sure patients take their medication, without fail, no matter
how much they may miss the power and energy of their manic episodes.
"When you're on, you can feel very good," Zsigovics said. "It can be
hard to give that up."</TE>
<TE>   Therapists also can teach patients some of the same self-control
techniques that help longtime smokers and drinkers quit: Identify the
situations or stresses that trigger episodes; diffuse or avoid them,
if possible; and stick to stable daily work and sleep routines.
Several recent studies have shown that disruptive events -- work
pressure, arguments with a spouse -- are strongly linked to manic
episodes in people with bipolar disorder. "I can tell you that for me
being extremely rushed, or being challenged aggressively in an
argument, can put me at risk" of a manic episode, said Stephen
Propst, 38, of Atlanta, who operates a Web site at
www.atlantamoodsupport.com for bipolar sufferers and their families.
"And when you're not up to par, there are things, like social
occasions, which only aggravate the illness."</TE>
<TE>   That's where close friends and family members come in. Over the
last several years, David Miklowitz, a psychologist at the University
of Colorado, has studied the effect of family counseling on the
behavior of patients with bipolar disorder. In a 21-week course,
Miklowitz teaches patients' parents and siblings how to spot the
warning signs of an imminent manic episode -- the increased
irritability, the big plans, the fast talking -- and manage them by
dialing down tension in the home. One of the techniques is called the
"three-volley rule": If a disagreement with the patient prompts an
escalating series of three personal attacks, it's time to back off.</TE>
<TE>   "Change the subject if you can, or enlist the person in solving
whatever the problem is," Miklowitz said. "In some ways these
techniques are similar to marital therapy for high-conflict couples."</TE>
<TE>   In one recent study involving 101 families, Miklowitz reported
that bipolar patients who received mood-stabilizing drugs and
family-focused treatment had a 29% risk of relapse over the course of
a year, compared with a rate of 53% among patients who got medication
and no family counseling. A similar study, due to be published next
year, finds that a counseling program that involves the patient's
family is a more powerful check on mood swings than programs that
focus solely on individual therapy. Relapse rates in those who got
drugs and individual counseling were 60% during the year, five times
higher than the rate among those whose families were involved in
treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Though many prominent artists and writers, including Leo Tolstoy
and Vincent Van Gogh, are thought to have suffered from manic
depression, there's no good evidence that the disorder is any more
common in creative people than in the general population, researchers
say. With the variety of medications and talk therapies now
available, psychiatrists say, creative people can find relief from
their mood swings without fear of losing their inventive sharpness.</TE>
<TE>   Most patients say the emotional seesaw never completely stops. But
new combinations of treatment are making the ride a lot easier for
many. "The difference is that without medication and social support,
it's like you're standing up in the car, with nothing to hold onto,"
said Propst. "Once you're getting good treatment, it's like you're
seated, with your seat belt on."</TE>

<TE>   Bipolarity in degrees</TE>
<TE>   About 5% of the population is believed to have some form of
bipolar disorder.</TE>
<TE>   Bipolar I: Severe manic episodes, characterized by grandiose
thoughts, irritability, decreased need for sleep. Severe depression
often precedes or follows the episode. Sometimes requires
hospitalization.</TE>
<TE>   Bipolar II: Distinct periods of depression and hypomania, a less
severe manic episode. Heightened mood and irritability typically
lasts no more than several days.</TE>
<TE>   Cyclothymic disorder: Chronic, fluctuating mood disturbances with
hypomanic and depressive symptoms that are not as severe or
persistent as those associated with bipolar I or II, and may occur
within a single day.</TE>
<TE>   Bipolar spectrum disorders:  Symptoms include one- or two-day
emotional highs and often longer-term depression. Recent research
suggests these milder problems are related to bipolar I and II.</TE>

<HD>Glucosamine gets new validation as a way to relieve
arthritis pain</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>People with arthritis who take glucosamine have said it makes their
joints feel better, and some studies have confirmed these reports.
Now a three-year study at the Prague Institute of Rheumatology has
confirmed that glucosamine appears to stop the narrowing of the space
in the knee joint that typically occurs with arthritis.</LD>
<LD>   More than 100 men and women with mild to moderately severe knee
arthritis for at least a decade took 1,500 milligrams of glucosamine
sulfate or a placebo once a day for three years. X-rays of
participants' knee joints, taken when they began the study and every
year thereafter, showed that the critical space where the bones of
the leg meet was more likely to narrow in those taking the placebo
than in those taking glucosamine.</LD>
<LD>   In arthritis, the cartilage that normally covers the ends of the
bones is damaged so the bones can rub together. At three years, 14 of
the 56 people taking placebos had severe narrowing, a sign that
arthritis has become worse, compared with 5 of the 66 taking the
supplement.</LD>

<HD>For Parkinson's, Vitamin E from food may be better</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dianne Partie Lange</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In pill form, antioxidants may not do much to prevent Parkinson's
disease, new research indicates, but at least one shows promise when
eaten in food.</LD>
<LD>   When researchers analyzed the food frequency questionnaires and
supplement records of more than 100,000 participants in an ongoing
health study, they discovered that getting large amounts of
antioxidants from pills, even when combined with food sources, didn't
help prevent Parkinson's disease. However, those who had higher
intakes of vitamin E from food sources, particularly nuts, had a 32%
lower risk of Parkinson's than those who consumed the least amount.</LD>
<LD>   It may be that there is some component in vitamin E-rich foods
other than vitamin E that prevents degeneration, the researchers
said. Another theory is that consuming adequate amounts of
antioxidants from an early age protects against disease. People
usually don't begin taking vitamin E supplements until they are
older.</LD>
<TE>   The research was done at Harvard School of Public Health, Brigham
and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School.</TE>

<HD>These skates let you ski in zero inches of snow</HD>
<DH>The new gizmo makes off-season workouts possible. But it
requires some practice -- and a big investment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. Michael Kennedy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A contraption that allows downhill and cross-country skiers to work
out in the off-season, that turns mountain bike trails into ski
trails -- why hadn't someone thought of this before?</LD>
<LD>   A Massachusetts inventor, Jamie Page, concocted the idea while
studying mechanical engineering at Stanford University. Although Palo
Alto has no snow, it does have a large system of biking and running
trails. So Page started tinkering and ended up with a skate that
finished second in the 1998 entrepreneurship contest at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</LD>
<LD>   Among other things, the wheels have a mechanism that allows the
skates to mimic the turning precision of downhill skis. They even
have brakes, thereby eliminating the fear of running into large trees
on a downhill run.</LD>
<TE>   I saw a picture of the skates while leafing through a fitness
magazine and, as I'd been a decent skier in my long ago Alaska days,
thought they might be worth trying. Cross-country skiing is one of
the best aerobic workouts. It uses virtually every muscle and
requires the stamina and strength of a long-distance runner.</TE>
<TE>   I called Crosskates and asked for a pair of loaners. And therein
lies the biggest problem for the average enthusiast. The skates,
which have been in production for less than a year, sell for about
$550. The boots are an extra $125. All told, it's nearly a $700
investment, which can be looked at two ways: They are much more
expensive than in-line skates or they are about the same price as a
mountain bike. In short, you really have to want them.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Laage, a 52-year-old engineer from Granada Hills, swears by
them. He is a member of a Nordic ski patrol at Mount Pinos, just off
the Grapevine. He uses his Crosskates most every evening to prepare
for the coming snow season.</TE>
<TE>   "What I wanted to do was get back to carrying a pack while using a
cross-country motion," he said. And Crosskates, he said, has allowed
him to do that.</TE>
<TE>   Another believer is Rod Roberts of Fountain Valley, who always had
wanted to find something that gave him the same exercising motion as
cross-country skiing. He said the Crosskates were difficult at first.
"You've got to get used to the turning and braking," he said. "Once
you do that, they're a lot of fun."</TE>
<TE>   Armed with this knowledge -- or warning, I loaded the Crosskates
in my car and headed for the flatness of the Long Beach boardwalk. I
live at the edge of the San Gabriel National Forest, whose mountains
are steeper than the Rockies, but could not imagine hurtling down a
mountain on my first attempt. The Long Beach boardwalk, on the other
hand, is almost absolutely flat, the kind of place the Crosskates
people recommended for a first venture. The other good thing about
the path is that on a weekday afternoon, it is almost deserted,
thereby eliminating the possibility of too much embarrassment.</TE>
<TE>   As I strapped on the Crosskates in the parking lot, I began to
wonder how these clunky devices could replicate the feeling of
cross-country skiing. When I finally stood up, I felt wobbly and was
glad for the ski poles that had been sent along. I donned my biking
helmet and wrist guards, fully expecting to take a quick tumble.</TE>
<TE>   Gingerly, I started off, using the skating motion recommended to
get moving. After a few turns in the parking lot, I headed for the
boardwalk, finding myself both elated that I was moving and
frustrated by the lack of speed I could generate. The Crosskates are
bulky and, certainly at first, difficult to maneuver. But the poles
helped propel me along the concrete path.</TE>
<TE>   I knew almost immediately that this would be a tough day on the
heart. My outer limit heart-rate optimum is 140 and it took only a
few minutes to move out of that zone, and at one point it was at a
high of 187. I pushed toward the north and, as I had anticipated,
only a few joggers and bikers were on the boardwalk. I was breathing
heavily at the half-mile mark and had to stop, letting my heart rate
slow before continuing on.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, I reached the Long Beach pier and sat down on a bench to
get my breath back. I'd only been going for less than 20 minutes, but
knew it would be a struggle to get back to the car. An elderly,
weathered man looked at me suspiciously.</TE>
<TE>   "That a new thing?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure is for me," I replied.</TE>
<TE>   With that, I headed back, making better progress as I skated. But
still, I needed to stop a couple of times to catch my breath. As I
got to the car, I concluded this would be a great regular workout,
given time to master the art, and that I'd probably missed the best
part -- going downhill.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Crosskates catch on remains to be seen. It may take a
while for skiers to discover them -- and maybe even longer for many
people to make the monetary investment. After all, it's possible to
get the same kind of workout in the gym without nearly the danger
factor involved in Crosskates. And you won't have to take out a
second mortgage to buy a pair.</TE>
<TE>   The next time I see a Crosskater hurtling down one of my nearby
hiking trails, I'll know they have arrived. And I'll be sure to get
out of the way.</TE>

<LD>Although skiing and snowboarding may be the most high-profile winter
sports, snowshoeing is gaining in popularity, especially among women,
according to the Outdoor Industry Assn., a trade group for equipment
manufacturers and retailers. To keep up with demand, San
Francisco-based Atlas Snow-Shoe Co. has spent two years developing
snowshoes specially designed for a woman's narrower stride and
stance.</LD>
<LD>   Elektra 8 and 10 series: Although the shoes have arch supports and
comfortable, easy-to-use bindings, the question remains: Do women
actually need special snowshoes? Perhaps, says Ingrid Middaugh, a
26-year-old amateur snowshoe racer from Vail, Colo. She had not heard
of the new Atlas series, but said, "I have three different brands of
unisex snowshoes, and with all of them, I kick myself in the calf
with the tail of the shoe and I end up with bruises on the backs of
my calves. I figured that was just part of snowshoeing, but my
husband snowshoes, and I've never seen him do that."</LD>
<LD>   Price: $169 to $249. Available at Sport Chalet stores, through the
Title Nine Sports catalog, and online at www.rei.com. To visit the
Atlas Web site, go to www.atlassnowshoe.com.</LD>

<HD>House calls by doctors, revisited</HD>
<DH>Popularity rises among elderly Medicare patients and those
who can afford to pay extra.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martin Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All but extinct a couple of decades ago, the doctor house call has
quietly reclaimed a small but important role in health care and
appears poised to expand its popularity during the next several
years.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's doctors made about 1.6 million visits to patients'
homes in 2001, an increase of about 100,000 from the previous year.
In fact, physician house calls have topped the 1 million mark every
year since the mid-1990s, according to government statistics. These
doctor visits, paid for by Medicare, were made primarily to the homes
of elderly patients who were unable to get to a physician's office
because of chronic illness.</LD>
<LD>   There's another factor driving the popularity of house calls.
Across the country, a number of private companies -- some founded by
doctors -- are starting or expanding businesses to provide at-home
medical care to patients. One such firm, AM-PM House Calls, operates
in more than two dozen major cities, including Los Angeles, largely
catering to more affluent city dwellers and travelers.</LD>
<TE>   The rise in doctor house calls for Medicare recipients is related
to the growing number of elderly Americans, many of whom are disabled
or who have chronic problems that require frequent care. If such
patients can't get to a doctor their conditions may deteriorate,
resulting in more intensive, and costlier, care later. If a patient
with a chronic respiratory problem doesn't get regular care, for
example, the result may be an emergency -- transportation by
ambulance, evaluation in the ER and overnight hospital stays, said
Constance Row, executive director of the American Academy of Home
Care Physicians, a nonprofit organization based in Edgewood, Md.</TE>
<TE>   A much different reason for increased interest in house calls is
the desire of more affluent Americans for care that offers
convenience, privacy and the comfort of receiving medical attention
in one's own home.</TE>
<TE>   "Who wants to wait six, seven, even eight hours in the ER for
medical care?" said Dr. Peter Waldstein, a Beverly Hills pediatrician
who is one of about 15 doctors involved in a start-up Los Angeles
company called SOS MD4U. The firm expects to launch its 24-hour house
call service in the next couple of months. The target patients: those
who desire prompt medical attention but who are not critically ill,
said Waldstein. He said a house call would cost $225; in contrast,
his customary fee for an office visit is $75.</TE>
<TE>   While Waldstein and his fellow doctors hope their new service will
have broader appeal than just the highly affluent, other doctors are
focusing their attention on celebrity clientele.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. David Armon, a Beverly Hills dermatologist, provides in-home
medical services for everything from a teenage acne outbreak to Botox
treatment. His fee? Between $3,000 and $5,000 a visit. "Celebrities
need to keep their privacy and beauty secrets intact," said Armon.
"The last thing my celebrity clients want the world to know is that
they have had a mole removed, liposuction, Botox injections or a skin
cancer scare."</TE>
<TE>   Health-care observers believe that the Medicare-related number of
house calls will grow. That's largely because the number of seniors
is expected to double in the next 20 years, said Row, of the American
Academy of Home Care Physicians. Today, the majority of Medicare
payments for house calls goes toward treatment of the roughly 2
million Americans who are chronically housebound.</TE>
<TE>   While the public may view house calls as an extravagance, Row
makes the familiar point about an ounce of prevention being worth a
pound of cure. "The system isn't very good at handling chronic
illnesses," she said. "It adds to health-care costs, pain and
suffering."</TE>
<TE>   One reason house calls all but disappeared by the mid-1970s was
inefficiency. A doctor in an office can see 20 or more patients a
day. A doctor making house calls would be hard-pressed to look in on
half as many.</TE>
<TE>   With this in mind, Medicare pays physicians more for a house call
than an office visit: $182 for an office visit, on average, compared
with $262 for a house call, according to national figures from the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.</TE>
<TE>   Private insurance coverage for house calls is murkier. Susan
Pisano, a spokeswoman for the trade group American Assn. of Health
Plans, said reimbursement would depend on several factors, including
whether a doctor was part of the insurer's physician network. "It's
like not you could just call a doctor for any old reason and say, 'Be
at my house at 5 o'clock,' " she said.</TE>
<TE>   House call doctors say there is a lot they can handle with their
black bag. "I've given everything from nebulizer treatments for
asthma and stitched deep wounds," said Dr. Dorsa Babai, who oversees
AM-PM House Calls coverage of California. "I've even had a portable
X-ray machine brought in."</TE>

<HD>Defensive measures against a super bug</HD>
<DH>Researchers are developing vaccines and enlisting the
body's immune system in the war on staph infections.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a paradox of modern medicine: High-tech marvels such as heart
surgery and kidney transplants are helping people live longer, but
they're also providing new targets for a dangerous type of bacteria.</LD>
<LD>   Staphylococcus aureus causes about half a million infections --
sometimes referred to as staph infections -- a year. The infections
often occur in people who have had surgery to insert heart valves and
stents, catheters, even artificial hip joints. And because S. aureus
regularly reinvents itself, it's now resistant to a wide range of
antibiotics. That can be life-threatening for people with serious
infections.</LD>
<LD>   At Harbor-UCLA Medical Center's Research and Education Institute,
scientists are at the forefront of research on the bug that may lead,
within the next few years, to new ways to arrest it.</LD>
<TE>   Led by Dr. Arnold S. Bayer, one of the world's leading authorities
on S. aureus, the research team is going beyond the traditional use
of antibiotics, studying ways to cripple the bacteria before they can
seize control in the body. Already, a vaccine is being tested that
may protect very ill newborns from deadly staph infections.</TE>
<TE>   "These organisms are good warriors," says Bayer, associate program
director of the Adult Infectious Disease Division at Harbor-UCLA
Medical Center. "They're armed to the teeth with mechanisms to infect
patients at risk. It's the ultimate pathogen."</TE>
<TE>   The bacteria love stents and catheters, in particular, because
they can grow either on the artificial material or on human tissue.
As more people undergo procedures to insert artificial devices, S.
aureus has more opportunities to thrive.</TE>
<TE>   "The pool of people at risk is increasing and more antibiotics are
being dumped in. But that is driving [antibiotic] resistance," Bayer
says.</TE>
<TE>   The goal is to find solutions that don't rely on antibiotics to
kill the bug, says Michael R. Yeaman, also a member of the
institute's infectious diseases team.</TE>
<TE>   "Using an antibiotic to sterilize the landscape of a tissue is one
approach. But only one approach," Yeaman says. "We're interested in
ways that won't pressure the organism into developing resistance.
It's how do we not have a war here?"</TE>
<TE>   To avoid doing battle with S. aureus, the team is using new
knowledge about the genetic structure of the bacterium to find ways
to cripple it. Bayer, for example, is working on a vaccine that could
remove the bug's ability to adhere to surfaces. A clinical trial
testing the vaccine is underway on low birth-weight babies, who also
are susceptible to the infection.</TE>
<TE>   The vaccine project is in collaboration with a Georgia-based
biotechnology company, Inhibitex Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Other researchers at the institute are exploring whether the
body's defense systems can be harnessed to better attack an
infection, Yeaman says. Most people, he notes, are assaulted by a
variety of filthy bugs each day and don't fall ill.</TE>
<TE>   "Something is really working well" in those cases, he says. "The
question is, how do we make our own immune system work more
effectively?"</TE>
<TE>   Scientists also are taking a close look at the molecules in
aspirin because S. aureus seems to be affected by chemicals similar
to aspirin. "In 10 years we'll be treating staph infections in a
multidimensional way," Bayer says. "It won't be with one drug."</TE>
<TE>   And that's good news. About 70% of all deaths are due to an
infection, Yeaman says. "Unless we can defend ourselves," he says,
"we will succumb to infection."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<TE>   The staph file</TE>
<TE>   * Between 30% and 50% of people carry the Staphylococcus aureus
bacteria. The bacteria usually reside in the nose.</TE>
<TE>   * Staph can enter the body through a cut in the skin. In serious
infections, the bug then spreads to adjacent tissue, nearby organs or
through the blood stream, causing such dangerous illnesses as
pneumonia, blood poisoning or even the "flesh-eating" necrotizing
fasciitis. Highly aggressive treatments are needed to stop the
infection.</TE>
<TE>   * Staph infections (caused by S. aureus and another type called S.
epidermis) are diagnosed in about 500,000 people a year in the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   * Hospitalized patients with surgical wounds are particularly
vulnerable to staph infection. Hospital staph infections cause
between 60,000 and 80,000 deaths each year.</TE>
<TE>   * About 95% of staph bacteria are resistant to penicillin and
about 30% are resistant to synthetic penicillin antibiotics.</TE>

<LD>Strollers don't look dangerous, but according to the U.S. Consumer
Product Safety Commission, they were responsible for more than 64,000
injuries requiring emergency room treatment over a five-year period.
In 75% of those injuries, a new study has found, the child fell from
the stroller. Although most injuries were minor, about 2% of children
were hospitalized.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the injuries could have been prevented with proper use of
restraints to hold the children in place, says Elizabeth C. Powell, a
pediatric emergency medicine physician at Children's Memorial
Hospital in Chicago and the lead author of the study. More than half
of the injuries she and her colleagues at Northwestern University
reviewed occurred in children younger than age 1. Most involved
injuries to the head and face.</LD>
<LD>   Although manufacturers voluntarily include safety restraints on
products sold in the United States, the number of falls indicates
that either the waist wraps and/or shoulder harnesses were used
improperly or not at all.</LD>
<TE>   The data, which included accidents between 1994 and 1998, didn't
specify how the falls happened, says Powell. But, she adds, if you
strap a child in, they're less likely to fall from the stroller.
Being a mother of two, she says she's seen for herself how straps can
disappear when a stroller is folded and be difficult to find when
it's unfolded. Improving stroller designs so straps are readily
available could lower the injury rate, she says. Even better would be
passive restraints that can't be ignored.</TE>
<TE>   Although injuries from stroller tip-overs were far less frequent,
Powell says heavy objects should not be hung from the hook-like
handles that are on some strollers.</TE>

<HD>Sports drinks versus water</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephanie Oakes</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Will sports drinks affect my heart rate? And are they better for me
than water?</LD>
<LD>   There is no research indicating that sports drinks will elevate
the heart rate. In fact, they seem to have an opposite effect.
Because the cardiovascular system is less efficient when dehydrated,
not drinking enough fluids can increase the heart rate.</LD>
<LD>   Therefore, consuming fluids, such as water or a sports drink
during activity, reduces the risk of dehydration and limited physical
capacity.</LD>
<TE>   But don't confuse sports drinks with energy drinks, which may
include caffeine, botanicals and herbs. These substances can make
your heart beat faster, raise your blood pressure and hinder proper
hydration.</TE>
<TE>   As to whether you should consume sports drinks or water, that
depends. For many activities, such as low- or moderate-intensity
exercise, sports drinks are unnecessary -- and they come with
calories that you don't have to worry about with plain, old-fashioned
water. But sometimes a sports drink can be more effective than water.</TE>
<TE>   Research published in the International Journal of Sports
Nutrition has shown that sports beverages, which contain
carbohydrates and sodium, improve high-intensity performance in
people exercising less than 60 minutes -- and participants reported
that the activity seemed easier when they drank a sports drink
instead of water.</TE>
<TE>   Sports drinks may be more appropriate during lengthy exercising as
well. The sweat lost during such exercise is more than just water;
it's a combination of water, sodium and other electrolytes.
Therefore, drinking water will not fully replace what is lost.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   You've mentioned that you prefer to exercise in the morning. Why?</TE>
<TE>   When I exercise early in the morning, it seems to jump-start my
metabolism, giving me more energy throughout the day. And it's also
easier to find the time in the early hours. Surveys have shown that
most people who exercise consistently are those who exercise in the
morning, primarily because there are fewer conflicting demands.
Squeezing exercise into a busy daily schedule can be tough in the
afternoon or evening -- children's demands, dinner preparations,
work-related problems and fatigue all can push exercise out of the
way.</TE>
<TE>   Also, recent research has shown that exercise increases mental
acuity, lasting four to 10 hours after the actual exercise. And we
all need more brain power during our waking, not sleeping, hours.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, though, the best time to exercise is whenever it fits
into your day or week.</TE>

<HD>An implant for Alzheimer's</HD>
<DH>A shunt inserted in the brain to drain away toxins has
shown early promise, but larger studies are still needed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane E. Allen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alzheimer's research has yet to yield many useful therapies, even as
the demand for treatments grows -- U.S. cases are expected to
increase from 4 million to as many as 16 million by the middle of
this century. A promising vaccine produced brain inflammation;
medications that help patients function better during the early and
moderate stages eventually lose ground to the incurable disease; and
newer compounds to treat and prevent it remain years from reaching
pharmacies.</LD>
<LD>   So it's not surprising that scores of people with Alzheimer's are
signing up to have shunts implanted in their brains, an invasive
approach that has become one of the few bright spots in Alzheimer's
research.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Gerald Silverberg, a Stanford neurosurgeon, reported last
month that experimental shunts had slowed disease progression in a
small group of patients. In that pilot study, published in the Oct.
22 issue of Neurology, he and his colleagues compared 12 patients
with mild to moderate Alzheimer's who underwent shunt implantation
with 11 Alzheimer's patients who received traditional care. After a
year of monitoring and evaluation, the surgical patients remained
stable; the comparison patients declined.</LD>
<TE>   The shunts are designed to slowly drain away toxins from fluid
bathing the brain and spinal cord. The initial study not only found
the technique essentially safe -- no participants died or suffered
permanent complications -- it also found lower levels of toxic
protein fragments in shunted patients' brain fluid.</TE>
<TE>   Although Silverberg hasn't formally monitored those he operated on
three years ago, he said their families report they have not
deteriorated. "They are still living at home, still functioning,
still caring for themselves and don't require nursing home
placement," he said. Such success is notable given the disease's
usual progression. Silverberg formed a private company with three
colleagues to produce and further test the shunt. An expanded trial,
at 25 sites nationwide, aims to establish whether the device's
apparent early success holds up. If it does, Silverberg said, "ours
will be the first therapy that appears to alter the course of
disease."</TE>
<TE>   The early promise was enough for scores of patients desperate to
slow or halt Alzheimer's inexorable decline.</TE>
<TE>   Among them is John F. Harvey, an 83-year-old retired Air Force
colonel diagnosed about 4 1/2 years ago. He underwent implantation of
an experimental shunt in July at Southwest Texas Medical Center in
San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Lilas, said the two agreed to his participation because
his physical health is excellent and his disease has been fairly
stable for about three years; they're hoping to keep it that way.
"The most important thing was that if he could be stabilized, then he
would be able to stay home," Lilas Harvey said.</TE>
<TE>   Because he's part of a randomized, placebo-controlled trial,
Harvey doesn't know whether his shunt is working, or whether it's one
of the comparison shunts that will remain closed for the first nine
months of the experiment. After that, closed shunts will be opened so
all participants can receive potential benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The idea behind the shunt, Silverberg said, stemmed from
observations that patients with hydrocephalus -- water on the brain
-- had a high incidence of Alzheimer's. Both conditions involve
decreased turnover of cerebrospinal fluid. Silverberg says that
because their fluid is more stagnant, Alzheimer's patients have a
hard time clearing out their excess of amyloid-beta protein
fragments, called peptides. As a result, the peptides glom together
and attach to brain cells, causing inflammation and damage.</TE>
<TE>   By speeding up the elimination of fluid containing these peptides
and allowing fresh fluid to take its place, the Stanford researchers
hypothesized, patients might do better. They modified existing shunts
-- narrow catheters commonly used in hydrocephalus -- with a low-flow
valve that keeps fluid flowing at a constant rate, regardless of
changing pressure inside the skull. So far, colleagues are waiting
and watching.</TE>
<TE>   The rationale behind the shunt procedure is valid and a larger
trial is warranted, said Greg M. Cole, associate director of the UCLA
Alzheimer's Disease Research Center.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Zaven Khachaturian, a medical and scientific advisor in
Washington to the Alzheimer's Assn., said that, although surgery
seems "a bit drastic," the work might lead to less invasive ways of
addressing the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "The general attitude is to be open-minded about any therapeutic
approach because you don't know which ones will work," Khachaturian
said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, some researchers are focused on the use of
neurotrophins, chemicals that can rejuvenate damaged brain cells;
others are looking to the long-term potential of stem cells. Research
projects also are studying the preventive potential of
anti-inflammatory drugs, antioxidants and estrogen. And laboratories
continue animal testing as they seek safer formulations of vaccines
against the amyloid beta protein.</TE>
<TE>   With the shunt trial, what's most important for patients, Cole
said, is to find out "whether or not they're really stabilizing these
people" and how much time the procedure will buy them and their
caregivers.</TE>

<LD>Taurine, an amino acid made by the body, also is found in animal
proteins, such as meat, fish and eggs. The Food and Drug
Administration recently seized shipments and stopped sales of a
taurine supplement made by Kirkman Laboratories, accusing the
Oregon-based manufacturer of making unsubstantiated claims that the
product could reduce symptoms of autism.</LD>
<LD>   Uses: Interest stems from the fact that taurine plays a role in
brain and retinal development. It's found in breast milk (and added
to infant formula) and helps produce bile acids, which aid in fat
absorption.</LD>
<LD>   Dose: Capsules of 500 to 1,000 milligrams usually are taken two or
three times a day.</LD>
<TE>   Precautions: There is little to suggest that taurine supplements
are potentially harmful or toxic although very high doses may cause
diarrhea. Taurine may interact with certain chemotherapy drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Research: Because the body makes taurine, most people don't need
supplements. However, some researchers suspect they may be able to
help people with epilepsy, Down syndrome, depression, eye disease,
heart disease and diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   Dietary supplement makers are not required by the U.S. government
to demonstrate that their products are safe or effective. Ask your
health-care provider for advice on selecting a brand.</TE>

<HD>Davis, Simon Make Final Bids</HD>
<DH>In stops around the state, governor urges loyal Democrats
to vote, touts his record on health care, education.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregg Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MONTEREY</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis crisscrossed California on Sunday in the first half
of a final campaign sprint aimed at transforming a steady lead in the
polls into triumph in Tuesday's election.</LD>
<LD>   In a daylong blitz that began at a Sunday morning worship service
in Los Angeles and ended with rallies in Monterey and Oakland, the
incumbent Democrat touted his record on education, health care, labor
issues, gun control and abortion rights.</LD>
<LD>   "We're moving the state forward, my friends!" Davis said to the
cheers of about 200 supporters at a rally at the Scottish Rite Center
in San Diego.</LD>
<TE>   Davis chided his Republican opponent, Bill Simon Jr., for having
voted only occasionally in recent elections. Davis challenged his
supporters to reject that example.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to vote for four more years of progress!" Davis
shouted. "We're going to vote for everyone on this stage! We're going
to vote for a Democratic sweep!"</TE>
<TE>   Drawing distinctions between his views and the more conservative
ones held by Simon, Davis told San Diego supporters that Simon "has a
totally different view of this state's future."</TE>
<TE>   Davis has maintained a lead over Simon in polls taken throughout
the race. At the same time, many voters -- even Democrats -- say they
don't like the governor.</TE>
<TE>   Lending uncertainty, polls show that an unusually large number of
likely voters -- about one in five -- have not decided which
candidate to support.</TE>
<TE>   While his campaign strategist, Garry South, predicted Sunday that
Davis would win by nine to 12 points, Davis has traveled the state,
trying to fire up unenthusiastic Democrats and burnish his image with
uneasy voters.</TE>
<TE>   During the Sunday service in the predominantly African American
West Angeles Church of God in Christ, Davis made a game effort to
rise above his wooden personal style, swaying slightly and clapping
uncertainly to the beat of the gospel-style hymns belted out by a
78-voice choir.</TE>
<TE>   Davis was joined at the service by Democratic U.S. Rep. Diane
Watson of Los Angeles and some of the Democratic candidates for
statewide offices.</TE>
<TE>   The congregation responded with warm applause when Davis strode to
the pulpit to sum up the accomplishments of his first term. Davis
prefaced his comments by noting that his wife, Sharon, "brought me
back to the Lord about 15 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Davis emphasized his record on education. "Schools are getting
better," he said. "We're on the right road."</TE>
<TE>   He won applause when he talked about expanding access to higher
education by creating new scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   "We want everyone's dream to come true, and education is the
passport to a better life," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the day, Davis carefully avoided any direct reference
to the looming state budget crisis, which experts say will force the
next governor to make deep program cuts and raise taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Before the church audience, however, Davis noted that he had
resisted past pressure to raise community college and college fees,
which rank among the lowest in the country.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time you raise fees you freeze somebody out of a better
life," said Davis. "I'm doing my best to not let those fees rise."</TE>
<TE>   Davis also talked about how he has dramatically expanded the
Healthy Families health-care program for the children of working-poor
families, from 51,000 children when he took office to 650,000
children. A Davis proposal to expand the program to include adults
was scrapped this year because of the state's $24-billion budget
shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego, where Davis was joined by other Democratic
candidates and a broad spectrum of supporters, some Democratic
activists conceded that many people are unenthusiastic about the
election.</TE>
<TE>   But many also said that the efforts of Democratic party phone
banks, precinct-walking and other get-out-the-vote work will pay off
on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there are people who want to defy what the headlines are
saying -- that people aren't going to turn out to vote," said Arlie
Ricasa, 38, a Democratic activist and a school board member running
for reelection in the Sweetwater Union High School District. Davis'
strong support among labor unions was evident Sunday, as it has been
throughout his campaign. Union activists have provided logistical
support at campaign stops and have been a driving force behind
Democrats' voter-turnout efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Art Pulaski, leader of the California Labor Federation, which
represents more than 1,200 union locals across the state, reminded
people at the San Diego rally that Davis had signed the nation's
first paid family leave bill and other measures important to working
families over the last four years.</TE>
<TE>   While pressing his loyalists to vote Tuesday, Davis brushed off
the latest round of Simon attack ads calling into question the
governor's campaign fund-raising practices.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Simon is just sinking farther and farther into the mud,"
Davis told reporters after the Los Angeles church service. Davis also
turned aside questions about his lead in the polls and his high
negative ratings among voters.</TE>
<TE>   But later, as his campaign plane landed in Monterey, he allowed
this much: "I can see victory at the end of the tunnel."</TE>

<HD>Davis, Simon Make Final Bids</HD>
<DH>On the second day of his 'Fire Gray Davis' tour, Republican
challenger accuses governor of misusing office.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Finnegan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Republican Bill Simon Jr. wrapped up the final weekend of the
governor's race Sunday with harsh swipes at Democratic incumbent Gray
Davis, using Sen. John McCain to assail the governor's pursuit of
campaign money.</LD>
<LD>   On the second day of his "Fire Gray Davis" tour of California,
Simon barnstormed in San Diego, Los Angeles and Bakersfield.</LD>
<LD>   With crowds of supporters shouting "Dump Davis," he blamed his
rival for bad schools, the power crisis and the sputtering economy,
among other things.</LD>
<TE>   But above all, he accused Davis of misusing the governor's office
in a relentless hunt for campaign contributions.</TE>
<TE>   "Is there anybody here that doubts that Gray Davis' signature is
for sale?" Simon called to 100 cheering supporters at an Olvera
Street rally in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "No!" they shouted back.</TE>
<TE>   "Is there anybody that doubts that Gray Davis sells public policy
to the highest bidder?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   "No!" they responded.</TE>
<TE>   The attacks were part of Simon's effort to frame the election
Tuesday as a referendum on an unpopular governor. Neither of the
television ads that Simon is running in the final days of the race
says anything about his own political agenda; instead, they portray
Davis as a dishonest, incompetent governor.</TE>
<TE>   Picking up that theme at a Simon rally Sunday morning in San Diego
was McCain, the Republican senator from Arizona who has made campaign
finance reform his signature issue.</TE>
<TE>   "You need a governor who can lead this state out of the morass
that it's in and restore respect to the office of governor," McCain
said.</TE>
<TE>   Talking to reporters after the rally, held near a veterans
memorial museum in Balboa Park, McCain was more blunt about Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think the way he has conducted this fund-raising, the
clear appearance of total impropriety, was a disgrace, and it's
everything that I have campaigned against and fought against my
entire time in public office," McCain said.</TE>
<TE>   The governor has long denied trading state favors for campaign
money, insisting that he makes decisions on merit.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' spokesman, Roger Salazar, said McCain would be "better off
sticking to the issues rather than slinging mud." He cited measures
signed by Davis that have tightened donation disclosure requirements
and will impose contribution limits after the election.</TE>
<TE>   "No governor of California has done more to create transparency in
California's campaign finance system than Gray Davis," Salazar said.</TE>
<TE>   For Simon, McCain's presence in San Diego was aimed at more than
just reinforcing attacks on Davis.</TE>
<TE>   McCain is a renowned former prisoner of war who was captured as a
Navy pilot in North Vietnam, and the large military population in the
San Diego area has a strong influence on the region's politics.</TE>
<TE>   McCain, whose 2000 presidential campaign attracted many
independent voters, also appeals to constituencies that are crucial
for Republicans who seek statewide office in California.</TE>
<TE>   "He's enormously popular among the very groups of voters we are
approaching: independents, undecideds and folks in the middle," said
state Republican Chairman Shawn Steel, who waved a Gray Davis "For
Sale" sign at Simon's rallies.</TE>
<TE>   Still, McCain's presence underscored the absence of Simon's other
most prominent supporters, President Bush and former New York City
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, in the final days of the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   At a Simon campaign stop last month in Burbank, Giuliani vowed to
return to California once more to stump for Simon.</TE>
<TE>   But Giuliani has not come back, and this week he planned to
campaign for candidates in Maryland and Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has skipped California as he has raced from state to state to
promote candidates in contests that the White House views as more
competitive.</TE>
<TE>   McCain acknowledged that Simon, consistently behind Davis in the
polls, remained an underdog. "We all know it's going to be a tough,
uphill battle," McCain said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon put a more optimistic spin on the state of the race, even as
he ripped into Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be a close election," Simon told supporters at
Olvera Street, a traditional political backdrop.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite all the brave talk of Gray Davis, he is in a panic right
now, because he spent $65 million trying to tear me down, and the
race is a dead heat," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Simon campaign billed the Olvera Street rally as part of its
outreach to Latinos. Mary George, Simon's diversity outreach
chairwoman, spoke in Spanish to cheering supporters waving blue and
yellow Simon-for-governor signs.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. David Dreier (R-San Dimas) led a "Viva Simon!" chant, then
switched to French, introducing the candidate and his wife Cindy as
"the piece de resistance."</TE>
<TE>   A Boy Scouts of America official gave Simon a "distinguished
citizen" award before Simon let loose again on Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "I promise you that every day of my administration, my door will
always be open, and there will not be a toll gate out in front of
it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Because we know one thing for sure. All the instances that we've
heard about Gray Davis selling public policy and selling his
signature, all the while he's raising money for himself, he's not
spending time working for our people."</TE>
<TE>   Later, with confetti blowing across the stage, Simon and other GOP
candidates danced and clapped hands as a band performed the song with
the lyric "Play that funky music, white boy."</TE>

<HD>In Oklahoma, Bombs Still Win Wars</HD>
<DH>High-tech weaponry aside, the people who toil at a remote
complex in McAlester know the Pentagon can't go into battle without
them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Esther Schrader</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>McALESTER, Okla.</DL>
<LD>McALESTER, Okla. -- As the Pentagon gears up for a potential war with
Iraq, a little-known bomb factory on the rolling plains of
southeastern Oklahoma has become the untouted epicenter of the
military's race to make the bombs, missiles and ammunition the U.S.
military can't go to war without.</LD>
<LD>   At the McAlester Army Ammunition Plant, the sole provider of
almost every conventional bomb dropped by the Army, Navy, Air Force
and Marines, employees work 12-hour shifts and six-day weeks on
orders to fill critical stockpiles. Employment on the production
lines of the vast plant -- the largest employer in the region -- is
up more than 10% in the last year, to more than 1,000.</LD>
<LD>   Orders for bombs have more than doubled over two years ago.</LD>
<TE>   "I like to say that we're leaving McAlester's calling card every
time a U.S. plane drops a bomb," said Army Col. Jyuji Hewitt, the
plant's commander.</TE>
<TE>   The flurry of activity at McAlester is testament to a basic truth
about the American military. While U.S. fighting has been portrayed
in recent years as fueled by the technological advances in the way
the military guides bombs and missiles, planes, ships and soldiers,
the Pentagon's ability to fight rests in large part on the vast
industrial base built since World War II to make the elemental tools
of war.</TE>
<TE>   It is that infrastructure that rumbles into action when military
action appears imminent.</TE>
<TE>   "People think war-fighting today is about photons and electrons
and snazzy computers," said Gary Motsek, deputy director for support
operations at the Army Materiel Command, which runs the plant. "But
in fact, without places like McAlester, places that make the stuff
that goes boom, they might as well not make the computers."</TE>
<TE>   By the standards of today's gee-whiz war-fighting, where soldiers
on the ground communicate instantly on hand-held computers with
unmanned craft thousands of feet above them, there is nothing sexy
about McAlester.</TE>
<TE>   Its nearly 3,000 buildings of concrete and corrugated metal border
on dilapidated. Its production lines are connected by rail track laid
in 1943. And most of the work of making and filling bombs is still
done by hand, by workers dressed in white coveralls and brimless
canvas caps that make them look more like bakers than suppliers of a
21st century fighting force.</TE>
<TE>   A sign greeting drivers entering McAlester's city limits hails the
town as "Home of cowboys and Italians" but makes no mention of the
bomb factory that underpins its economy. Until this year, the plant
was closed to the media.</TE>
<TE>   McAlester has never been visited by a secretary of Defense or a
president. Pentagon officials say the current Defense secretary,
Donald H. Rumsfeld, is too busy to make the trip.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the McAlester plant has a monopoly on a product the Pentagon
cannot make war without. Because of the dirty and highly dangerous
nature of bomb production, the military long ago decided to make most
of its bombs in just one place.</TE>
<TE>   McAlester's bombs rained on Germany, Vietnam and Korea. Fitted
with high-tech computerized guidance kits built by Boeing and others,
McAlester's bombs helped drive Slobodan Milosevic out of Bosnia,
Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait and the Taliban out of Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   And if the U.S. goes to war against Iraq, it will be explosives
mixed in giant kettles and poured, fitted and sealed inside bomb
casings at McAlester that will drop from America's bombers, combat
helicopters and fighter jets.</TE>
<TE>   "I came out here to work in the first days before Desert Storm,
and we were working 12 hours a day, six days a week. It's starting to
feel like that again," said Pat Belcher, 70, who spoke as she fitted
fuses onto artillery rounds. "I know as long as the situation is like
it is, I'm going to be here, working overtime and weekends."</TE>
<TE>   Belcher said she lost a half brother in World War II. Like other
workers at the plant, many of them the third or fourth generation of
their family working at McAlester, she sought the job because it pays
well for the area -- salaries start at about $11 an hour -- and has
good benefits.</TE>
<TE>   But she also says working at the plant gives her a certain amount
of pride.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to go to war. I don't want to see innocent people
get killed," she said. "But as long as I can remember, we've had to
defend ourself against other countries. You've got to be strong. And
what we make here is keeping us safe."</TE>
<TE>   Born in the rush to mobilize after Pearl Harbor and put up in six
months, McAlester was once part of a giant network of military-owned
ammunition plants and depots that stretched across the country. But
from its earliest days, McAlester was unique.</TE>
<TE>   Sprawling across 45,000 acres of prairie two hours from the
nearest city, the plant is the military's largest storage facility.
It holds 6 million square feet of storage space on land three times
the size of Manhattan. McAlester's concrete igloos house stockpiles
of ammunition for all four services -- from machine gun rounds to the
5,000-pound "bunker buster" bombs the Pentagon unleashed against
Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   The plant has not run at full capacity since the height of the
Vietnam War, when it made 6,000 bombs every 24 hours. In the 1980s,
it produced about that many in a year.</TE>
<TE>   Defense officials are cagey about precisely how many bombs
McAlester is producing these days. Army officials say it makes a
profit -- mostly by renting out its space and facilities to private
contractors such as Raytheon needing space to work with large
quantities of explosive materials -- but won't disclose its budget.</TE>
<TE>   Under strict guidelines established in recent months, much of the
production process is off-limits for viewing. But the officials
acknowledge that those production lines are humming.</TE>
<TE>   The popularity of the new generation of satellite-guided weapons
has also given McAlester new life.</TE>
<TE>   The plant produces "dumb bombs" -- metal casings of various sizes
filled with explosives and fitted with a fuse and a detonator.</TE>
<TE>   In one building on a recent day, workers poured plastic bonded
explosive the consistency of clay into the 8-foot tall steel bomb
casings that make up 2,000-pound bombs, then waited for the explosive
to settle. In another building they topped the casings off, then
capped them with metal plates and seamed them with a bonding agent.
Workers painted the noses of the bombs bright yellow. Yellow is for
the real bombs. Bombs without the paint have been filled with
concrete and will be used for practice.</TE>
<TE>   The work is dangerous. A fatal explosion at the plant in 1971
killed three workers. Last June, a man was crushed when a 2,000-pound
bomb fell on him. Workers and visitors to the plant wear special
shoes that reduce static electricity, which could set off a fire.
Workers' coveralls are laundered in flame retardant.</TE>
<TE>   These bombs are imprecise. When dropped from planes, especially,
they can land over a wide area. In World War II, bombardiers would
sometimes entirely miss their targeted cities.</TE>
<TE>   But today, these weapons have been transformed into "smart bombs,"
guided by lasers, global positioning systems and sophisticated
computer technology that can generally steer one to within 4 yards of
its target.</TE>
<TE>   The new bombs are essentially the same ones McAlester has been
making for generations, but fitted with a GPS-controlled tail fin and
strap-on winglets that help it glide. Known as joint direct attack
munitions, the bombs emerged as the star of the Afghan war.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 22,000 bombs dropped in that campaign, all were made at
McAlester and then fitted with the smart "kits" produced by Boeing at
a Missouri factory.</TE>
<TE>   The bombs cost about $5,000 each when they leave McAlester. When
military munitions crews fit the smart kits on them, their value goes
up to $20,000 each.</TE>
<TE>   The smart bombs became so popular in Afghanistan that their use
taxed U.S. inventories. The Boeing factory was producing about 750
kits per month at the time of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, said
Robert Algarotti, a Boeing spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Today about 2,000 kits a month are rolling off its production
line, and by next August, Boeing hopes to be making almost 3,000 a
month, Algarotti said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not allowed to tell you how many we're making at
McAlester," one Defense official said. "But I can tell you that every
one of those smart kits has to go on something, and every one of the
finished bombs is going to our war-fighters."</TE>

<LD>Inspectors had warned a food plant of numerous sanitation violations
months before a deadly listeria outbreak was linked to the facility,
but little was done to fix the problems.</LD>
<LD>   Moldy pipes, food particles left on conveyor belts, water leaking
onto meat and a cockroach found in a locker were among dozens of
problems the U.S. Department of Agriculture found at the suburban
Wampler Foods plant, according to inspection documents obtained by
the Philadelphia Inquirer.</LD>
<LD>   The plant closed Oct. 12 after officials identified it as a source
of a listeria outbreak blamed for at least seven deaths and dozens of
illnesses. Wampler's parent, Pilgrim's Pride, recalled more than 27
million pounds of turkey and chicken, the biggest meat recall in U.S.
history.</LD>

<LD>The Army is considering contracting out nearly 214,000 military and
civilian support jobs to the private sector in a plan to free money

the federal government through outsourcing.</LD>
<LD>   In a memo, Army Secretary Thomas E. White directed his commanders
to submit plans by Dec. 20 to privatize or outsource all functions
not essential to fighting wars. If approved, the unprecedented
government overhaul could begin this spring and affect two-thirds of
the Army civilian work force. Military personnel would be reassigned.</LD>
<LD>   Targeted are 154,910 civilian workers and 58,727 military

<HD>Bush Treads Carefully in Minnesota Contest</HD>
<DH>President recognizes state's sorrow over Wellstone's death,
but he still rallies the GOP.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Gerstenzang</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SIOUX FALLS, S.D.</DL>
<LD>Perhaps no incumbent Democrat was as firmly in the White House sights
this autumn as Paul Wellstone. He was a liberal thorn in the side of
a conservative administration -- unable to derail President Bush's
agenda when it gained centrist support, but nevertheless a certain
vote in the Senate against those policies.</LD>
<LD>   Against that backdrop, Bush stepped gingerly Sunday into the
emotion-laden race for the U.S. Senate in Minnesota.</LD>
<LD>   Abandoning some of the pointed commentary that he has directed at
Democrats in other districts -- and acknowledging the sorrow of
Wellstone's death -- the president still found a way to bring
cheering partisans to their feet at a St. Paul sports arena in
support of Norm Coleman, the Republican candidate who now faces
former Vice President Walter F. Mondale in Tuesday's election.</LD>
<TE>   Later, Bush spoke at a rally for Rep. John R. Thune in South
Dakota. Like Coleman, Thune was aggressively solicited by the
president's advisors -- and eventually by Bush himself -- to run for
the Senate when they sensed opportunities to unseat vulnerable
Democratic incumbents.</TE>
<TE>   Employing a two-minute suspension of typical campaign rhetoric,
Bush acknowledged to his St. Paul audience that "Minnesota is going
through a traumatic time" and called Wellstone "a principled
senator."</TE>
<TE>   "Paul Wellstone was respected by all who worked with him. He will
be missed by all who knew him," the president added.</TE>
<TE>   But he quickly returned to his political agenda. "Now once you go
in that voting booth, I've got a suggestion," Bush said. "The best
candidate for the future of Minnesota is the next United States
senator, Norm Coleman."</TE>
<TE>   It was careful maneuvering through the political thicket that
erupted after Wellstone's death 11 days before the election.</TE>
<TE>   Alluding to the 74-year-old Mondale's years in public life at the
center of the liberal faction of the Democratic Party -- he served
for 12 years in the Senate before becoming Jimmy Carter's vice
president -- Bush said that Coleman, 53, would bring "the kind of
fresh air we need in the United States Senate."</TE>
<TE>   And twice he spoke Coleman's campaign slogan, targeted directly at
Mondale: "The future of Minnesota rests with Norm Coleman."</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing the possibility that Mondale will benefit from
sentimental support in this state, where Democrats are struggling to
fare as well as they did when another Minnesotan, former Vice
President Hubert H. Humphrey, and Mondale were at the top of their
game, the president added:</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of people who may not call themselves Republicans
who have been impressed with the nature of the campaign Norm Coleman
has run" and the work he did as mayor of St. Paul.</TE>
<TE>   ''They know him like I know him: somebody who's willing to get rid
of the stale, old, tired, name-calling politics.''</TE>
<TE>   But Bush avoided some of the sharpest barbs that he has directed
at Democratic candidates in other cities.</TE>
<TE>   The aggressively political tenor of Wellstone's memorial service
last week took some of the edge off the sensitivity of the
president's visit here. The senior Republican in attendance last
Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, was booed
by Wellstone partisans who filled the college arena where the
memorial was held.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people were offended by some of the things that were said
and done at that memorial service," a senior White House official
told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   He said that the Minnesota race ultimately would be determined by
the way the two candidates conduct themselves in the closing moments
of the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be a race in which every gesture, every word,
every action is going to be taken by the voter, retained and then
used to evaluate the two candidates," said the official, who spoke on
the condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, two separate polls taken late last week showed each
candidate holding a lead. A Star Tribune Minnesota poll found 46% of
those surveyed supporting Mondale and 41% supporting Coleman, with 9%
undecided and 2% supporting Green Party and independent candidates.
The St. Paul Pioneer Press/Minnesota Public Radio poll gave Coleman
47% and Mondale 41%.</TE>
<TE>   The White House also is particularly interested in the South
Dakota Senate race; Republicans would like nothing better than to
knock off a Democratic incumbent from the home state of the Senate's
Democratic leader, Tom Daschle. The stop Sunday was Bush's second in
South Dakota in four days.</TE>
<TE>   The president was on the fourth of five consecutive days of
campaign travel. Sunday, a five-state day, took him from Florida to
rallies in Springfield, Ill.; St. Paul and Sioux Falls. In Illinois,
he campaigned for Rep. John Shimkus, who is in a close race against
Rep. David Phelps. Redrawn boundaries have put two incumbents in the
same district.</TE>
<TE>   Bush was to end up in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, barely 12 hours after
setting out from Tampa, Fla. Today, he travels from a midmorning
rally in Iowa to Missouri, Arkansas and Texas, arriving at his ranch
near Crawford in the evening.</TE>
<TE>   A campaign stop in Minnesota had been on Bush's tentative schedule
for this weekend, even before the crash that took the lives of
Wellstone, his wife, his daughter, and five others as they flew
through freezing rain in a private plane. The crash put all public
campaigning on hold last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   But with the politicking resuming, and Bush having overseen the
effort to bring Coleman -- a former Democrat -- into the race, the
president's political schedulers decided to hold to their original
plan: He would tour the upper Midwest, working first for Coleman and
then for Thune, the South Dakota Republican House member the White
House had pressured into the race to try to unseat Sen. Tim Johnson.</TE>

<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>The rhetoric was fiery and the audience enthusiastic at a National
Rifle Assn. get-out-the-vote rally here late last week.</LD>
<LD>   But the crowd still filled only about half the ballroom in the
Opryland convention center. And there was a distinct note of concern
in the message from the podium.</LD>
<LD>   "Some gun owners think they can sit this one out," said Chris Cox,
executive director of the NRA's Institute of Legislative Affairs.
"That's what [liberals] ... want you to do."</LD>
<TE>   This fall, the NRA is hardly alone in worrying that its supporters
lack the motivation to vote. Candidates, the national parties and
interest groups across the political spectrum are all struggling to
drive voters to the polls in a year when few issues have caught fire.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't remember a more difficult set of conditions for getting
people to vote in any election," said Kate Michelman, president of
the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League.</TE>
<TE>   Yet precisely because voter interest is so low this year, the
stakes are high for these get-out-the-vote drives. In an election
when relatively few Americans are expected to participate, the
efforts that move even relatively small numbers of voters could tip
dozens of close races.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a year when the ground game matters more than ever," said
Maria Cardona, the Democratic National Committee's communication
director.</TE>
<TE>   Both national parties are putting their money behind that
sentiment, investing in expensive efforts to identify their
supporters and then move them to the polls. Democrats say they have
put unprecedented sums -- about $15 million -- into the coordinated
get-out-the-vote campaigns run by state parties.</TE>
<TE>   That effort has ranged from a massive drive to update the state
parties' lists of Democratic voters to the systematic use of former
President Clinton to encourage turnout in the minority community.
Clinton has campaigned extensively and recorded radio ads and phone
call messages aimed at black voters. Last Friday, he conducted a
conference call with almost 2,000 African American ministers urging
them to turn out the vote.</TE>
<TE>   "In the 2000 [presidential] campaign, we were sitting around the
last three weeks debating whether to use Bill Clinton; now we are
debating where we can use him because we have so many requests," says
Donna Brazile, who managed Al Gore's election bid and now is
directing the Democrats' African American turnout effort.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans have revamped their get-out-the-vote efforts this
year, spending at least $20 million after the party concluded in an
internal review that the "Democrats did a better job of motivating
and turning out their voters" in 1998 and 2000.</TE>
<TE>   This year, under the banner of the "72-hour task force,"
Republicans have shifted their focus from paid phone banks and
mailings toward matching the Democratic success at recruiting
volunteers to knock on doors and make calls. In tests the Republican
National Committee conducted in 2001, it found communication from
volunteers increased turnout much more than calls from professional
phone banks.</TE>
<TE>   "When there is so much television advertising going on, and people
are getting tons of mail, this one contact -- going door to door,
having a volunteer call up on the phone -- really cuts through," says
Blaise Hazelwood, the political director of the RNC, who was knocking
on doors in Colorado on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the personal touch, Republicans also are banking on
President Bush's nonstop appearances in the campaign's final weeks to
push their partisans to the polls. Bush is on a swing that is taking
him to 17 cities in 15 states in the last five days of the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lack of Motivation</TE>
<TE>   All this effort may be critical in tilting the needle toward one
party or the other in close races. Yet it appears unlikely to
increase the overall level of participation.</TE>
<TE>   In some states with particularly engaging races -- such as the
tight Senate contests in South Dakota and New Hampshire -- analysts
expect large numbers of voters to turn out.</TE>
<TE>   But overall, most experts are expecting a meager national turnout.
Based on national polling released Sunday, Andrew Kohut, director of
the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, projects that
about 35% of eligible voters will show up Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   That would produce a turnout similar to the level in 1998, which
was the smallest showing for a midterm election since 1942, according
to the nonpartisan Committee for the Study of the American
Electorate.</TE>
<TE>   "People are not compelled to turn out for either party," Kohut
said. "We have all of these big issues, yet they haven't been
translated into any political point of view. People are not angry,
and they are not finger-pointing, and that's what it takes to get
people motivated."</TE>
<TE>   Relatively low turnout probably argues for a relatively low level
of change in Congress. The two most recent midterm elections that
produced big gains for one party, especially in the House, saw a
surge in voting. That was the case in 1982, when Democrats gained 26
House seats amid concern over the economy, and 1994, when a backlash
against Clinton's chaotic first two years swept Republicans to
control of the House and Senate.</TE>
<TE>   This year, no one sees such a brush fire developing for either
side. Indeed, in strikingly similar language, activists from both
ends of the ideological spectrum say that trying to ignite voter
interest this fall is like trying to start a fire with wet tinder.</TE>
<TE>   "There is less combustion out there on issues than in any year
I've seen in quite a while," says Wayne R. LaPierre, the NRA's
executive vice president and chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Two principal problems are confronting the get-out-the-vote
efforts on both sides.</TE>
<TE>   One is that the election has been overshadowed by a succession of
other stories -- first the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, then the debate over possible war with Iraq, and finally the
sniper shootings in the suburbs around Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Even more important, candidates in both parties are blurring
distinctions on many issues that organizers have traditionally used
to motivate their supporters. Republicans have tried to obscure
differences with Democrats on issues such as prescription drugs and
Social Security that have been critical to organized labor's
formidable turnout effort. And Democrats, especially in the states
that Bush carried in 2000, have moved to the right on cultural
issues, particularly guns.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting backstage in the Opryland ballroom here, for instance,
LaPierre marveled with equal parts admiration and frustration at a
flier Democratic Senate candidate Mark Pryor's campaign had
distributed the night before outside an NRA rally in Arkansas.</TE>
<TE>   At the rally, the NRA had endorsed Pryor's opponent, incumbent
Republican Tim Hutchinson, but the flier showed Pryor surrounded by a
group of hunters and describes him as a "strong defender of our right
to bear arms."</TE>
<TE>   "It was easier to motivate people," LaPierre said with a sigh,
"when [Al] Gore was handing out fliers saying all gun owners were
going to have to take a national test."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Groups Narrow Focus</TE>
<TE>   The AFL-CIO, which has run what many consider the most effective
turnout operation of any interest group in recent years, is facing
similar problems this fall. Steve Rosenthal, the federation's
political director, says it has switched its turnout message from
broad national issues toward more narrow union issues, such as job
safety and the minimum wage.</TE>
<TE>   "In an environment where voters are having a hard time
differentiating between where the candidates stand [on national
issues] ... we can trump some of the big-ticket issues with stuff
that is a little closer to home," he said.</TE>
<TE>   One exception to this pattern is NARAL. It has focused its
greatest efforts on Senate races in Colorado and New Hampshire, where
Democrats Tom Strickland and Jeanne Shaheen, respectively, have
emphasized their support for legalized abortion; their Republican
challengers oppose it.</TE>
<TE>   "We have people calling every two minutes for days on end, we have
literature drops, we have neighborhood walks set up all weekend long
in both of these states," Michelman said.</TE>
<TE>   One slight edge for Republicans in the turnout struggle may be the
nature of the battlefield.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the most competitive Senate races tend to be in rural or
Southern states -- such as South Dakota, Arkansas, Georgia, North
Carolina and Texas -- where the NRA, the most effective group at
turning out voters on the conservative side, has a wider reach than
the AFL-CIO, the most important Democratic-leaning group.</TE>
<TE>   But the unmatched overall scale of the AFL-CIO's effort -- which
is built on union members talking personally with other members --
still has Republicans concerned.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the reasons we did the task force and placed so much
emphasis on people-to-people contact is the unions," Hazelwood said.
"We have to work harder, and we have to start earlier."</TE>

<HD>Seniors See a Doctor Shortage</HD>
<DH>Lower Medicare reimbursements are causing a worsening
problem for the elderly, as they scramble to find physicians.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vicki Kemper</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BOULDER, Colo.</DL>
<LD>With its excellent public services, rich cultural offerings and fall
afternoons that glisten like gold in a prospector's pan, it is no
wonder that this outdoor-recreation mecca has also become a
retirement paradise.</LD>
<LD>   But for transplanted and local retirees alike, getting to see a
doctor can be even harder than registering for one of Boulder's
overbooked computer classes for seniors. Medicare cards, long
considered a guarantee of health care in old age, are proving little
better than fool's gold.</LD>
<LD>   Because the Medicare program has reduced the amount it reimburses
doctors, many seniors now have to make as many as a dozen phone calls
just to find a physician who is still accepting new Medicare
patients. Others were dropped by their longtime doctors when they
turned 65. "Seniors are going without care, and patients are getting
sicker," said Jim Peters, vice president of Boulder Community
Hospital. "We are close to a crisis."</LD>
<TE>   Colorado is merely one of the more dramatic examples of a trend
that is sweeping the country and threatening to undermine Medicare.
Many Medicare cardholders have supplemental insurance for
prescription drugs and other uncovered expenses, but since its
enactment in 1965, Medicare has provided basic health benefits for
all senior and disabled Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, at least. The aging of the population -- combined with
escalating health-care costs, cuts in Medicare reimbursements,
problems with Medicare HMOs and political gridlock in Washington --
is producing a physician shortage so severe that social service
agencies in some communities now count Medicare beneficiaries with
the homeless and the uninsured as being "medically underserved."</TE>
<TE>   The nonpartisan Center for Studying Health System Change recently
found that about 1 in 9 Medicare beneficiaries reported delaying care
or being unable to find a physician last year -- before this year's
5.4% cut in physicians' fees took effect.</TE>
<TE>   And with the announcement expected soon of a 4.4% cut for next
year in Medicare payments to doctors, the situation is likely to get
even worse.</TE>
<TE>   "If Congress does not reverse the cut, you will see a perfect
storm," said Dr. Jeremy A. Lazarus, a psychiatrist and president of
the Colorado Medical Society. "Physicians will stop seeing even
current Medicare patients."</TE>
<TE>   A bill to restore billions of dollars in reimbursements to doctors
is pending in Congress, but action this year appears unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers focused their election-year attention on demands by the
35-million-member AARP and other senior groups that Medicare begin
covering prescription drugs. But the Senate could not agree on the
details of a drug benefit, and when lawmakers in mid-October appeared
on the verge of reversing some of the fee cuts for doctors, Sen.
Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) prevented her colleagues from doing one
without the other.</TE>
<TE>   The action left many Colorado physicians shaking their heads.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not talking about big money compared to a prescription drug
plan," Denver geriatrician Christopher Unrein said of Medicare
reimbursements. "If you don't have someone to write the prescription,
what good does a benefit do you?"</TE>
<TE>   But on Denver's north side, where a handful of Democratic
candidates appeared last month at a forum organized by AARP members,
prescription drugs topped the agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "I was more than disgusted" when Congress failed to pass a
Medicare drug benefit, said Elsie Johnson of Lakewood. The
69-year-old joined a Medicare HMO that helped her pay for her many
medications for diabetes, osteoporosis, high blood pressure and a
thyroid condition. She said she would vote against GOP Sen. Wayne
Allard on Tuesday despite being "a Republican from way back."</TE>
<TE>   For most of the 75 seniors at the forum, concerns about access to
doctors were lost in rhetoric about Social Security privatization and
drug companies' political influence.</TE>
<TE>   Yet seniors' representatives and patient advocates know the
problem is real. They believe that as more Medicare beneficiaries are
turned away by doctors' offices, they will begin to make a connection
between their inability to find a physician in Colorado and their
representatives in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Some already have.</TE>
<TE>   Vi Bowers, slight but sharp in her blue AARP vest, recently had a
hard time finding a gynecologist and an ophthalmologist in the Denver
suburb of Wheat Ridge. Three or four OB/GYN offices told her they
were not accepting new Medicare patients. Finally, she persuaded a
friend's doctor to take her.</TE>
<TE>   But now the 75-year-old is afraid her new doctors will drop her.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to be careful not to step on your doctor's toes,"
Bowers said. "They don't want to mess" with Medicare because of the
low payments.</TE>
<TE>   The Denver offices of Colorado Patient Advocates, the Boulder
County Medicare ombudsman's help line and the private Colorado
Gerontological Society are all fielding more calls from Medicare
beneficiaries unable to find doctors or pay for their prescriptions</TE>
<TE>   Eileen Doherty, executive director of the gerontological society,
recently asked about 100 seniors attending a Medicare meeting in
suburban Littleton how many had a regular doctor.</TE>
<TE>   "Only one person raised their hand," she said. "When I asked how
many have had trouble finding a doctor, about half the hands went up,
and when I asked how many had to travel farther to get medical care,
almost all the hands went up."</TE>
<TE>   Some advocates say the problem seems to have stabilized after
their groups surveyed doctors' offices and distributed lists of
physicians still accepting Medicare patients.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, however, knowing how to navigate the system doesn't
help.</TE>
<TE>   Dorothy Rupert represented Boulder in the state Legislature for 14
years, working most of that time to make health care more available
to Colorado's poor. She knew the state's health-care system inside
out and grew concerned when new residents of The Academy retirement
community told her how hard it was to find a doctor.</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't until last year, on her last day as the term-limited
Democratic leader of the state Senate, that she experienced firsthand
the worsening Medicare doctor shortage.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband, then 79, suffered a severe stroke and, after the
frantic 911 call, the emergency room and the intensive care unit, she
began trying to reach his physician of more than 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   After days of repeated calls, the doctor's office manager "finally
called to say he wasn't Dick's doctor anymore," recalled Rupert,
still an activist at 76. "It was so hard to understand."</TE>
<TE>   After a months-long search -- aided by a private attorney -- for a
Medicare-accepting physician and a nursing home she could afford,
Rupert finally moved her husband to a facility near their son in
Louisiana, where health care costs less and more doctors accept
Medicare.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't that people [in Colorado] weren't trying to help,"
Rupert said, "but if the access isn't there, it doesn't matter."</TE>
<TE>   Access often isn't there. According to recent surveys, only 4
primary-care physicians in 10 accept new Medicare patients in
Colorado. In Colorado Springs -- where a former judge, military
retirees and leaders of prominent Christian ministries are among
those unable to find doctors -- the rate is closer to 1 in 10.</TE>
<TE>   Increasing numbers of retirees are simply doing without a
physician until they get sick. Hospital emergency departments are
serving as de facto examination rooms for seniors, and many of the
patients who arrive at the Penrose-St. Francis Senior Health Center
have gone without health care for a while.</TE>
<TE>   "Some patients have serious problems by the time we see them,"
said Dr. Raymond Wahl, who came out of retirement to serve as the
part-time medical director of the Medicare-only clinic. "We get a lot
of referrals from doctors" no longer taking Medicare patients, he
said. "It's a desperate situation."</TE>
<TE>   Opened in November 2000 as a mission of the nonprofit Penrose
Hospital and the private Penrose-St. Francis Foundation, the clinic
now has about 1,300 patients. They are seen by one of three full-time
nurse practitioners, who come cheaper than doctors. Wahl and another
physician work part time to handle consultations and various
administrative tasks.</TE>
<TE>   Although the patients, by all accounts, love the clinic, it is
unclear how long it will continue to operate.</TE>
<TE>   About 90 miles away, the not-for-profit Boulder Community Hospital
has adopted a three-pronged approach to the Medicare physician
shortage. The hospital requires all of its 30 staff physicians to
continue accepting Medicare patients. It works with local physician
groups to recruit Medicare doctors to Boulder by subsidizing their
relocation costs and salaries. And finally, the hospital and the
Boulder Medical Center, a large physician group, opened a
Medicare-only clinic on Sept. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Peters and his colleagues now believe it's Congress' turn to act.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if [Congress] can afford not to" increase Medicare
payments to doctors, he said. "In the long run, a fee increase will
cost less" than having Medicare patients resort to emergency rooms
for their health care.</TE>
<TE>   For many physicians, the math is fairly simple. In Colorado,
private insurers reimburse doctors at rates often 25% above what
Medicare pays for the same services. Faced with that, individual
physicians and group practices have made a business decision that no
more than some fixed percentage of their patients can be on Medicare.
Many are at their own ceiling, unwilling to take any more Medicare
patients.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, money is not the only reason doctors are dropping
Medicare patients, physicians say. Paperwork hassles, complex billing
codes and a "paranoia" about being accused of "fraud and abuse" also
play roles.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, however, "it's really the cost of medical care that
creates the [access] problem," said Dr. David Downs, president of the
Denver Medical Society. "We love our Medicare patients, but there
comes a point financially where you can't afford to see them any
more," said Dr. Ripley R. Hollister, president of the El Paso County
Medical Society in Colorado Springs.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, where the government has returned to deficit
spending and lawmakers weigh billions of dollars in competing demands
and services, the outlook remains murky for Medicare physicians and
patients.</TE>
<TE>   Ten-year cost estimates for a Medicare prescription drug benefit
range from $350 billion to $800 billion. The House has passed and the
Senate is considering a bill to restore about $11 billion in cuts
from doctors' Medicare reimbursements over 10 years, as well as to
provide additional Medicare payments for hospitals, nursing homes and
HMOs.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has said the prescription drug plans and
the proposed Medicare fee increases would cost too much.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously," Lazarus conceded, "it's a matter of money. But the
government has made a commitment to take care of the elderly, so they
need to do it." If lawmakers learn of the serious access problems
resulting from Medicare fee cuts and still fail to do anything about
it, he said, "they've broken their covenant."</TE>

<HD>Golisano to Stay in N.Y. Governor's Race</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Billionaire third-party candidate B. Thomas Golisano said Sunday he
was staying in New York's race for governor, ending days of
speculation that he might quit and endorse Democratic challenger H.
Carl McCall.</LD>
<LD>   Golisano made his announcement during a paid, two-minute address
broadcast Sunday night.</LD>
<LD>   "A vote for me is not wasted. I have been and still am a candidate
for governor," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Speculation about Golisano's intentions began Thursday when his
campaign began cutting back TV advertising. Since then, his campaign
had been sending mixed signals. The businessman ordered his pollster,
John Zogby, on Saturday to begin checking on how the race might
change if he pulled out and researched the legality of endorsing
McCall.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after his taped message, Golisano appeared before
about two dozen supporters at his Rochester headquarters. He said
McCall had asked him several days ago for his support.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought about it for quite a while," Golisano said.</TE>
<TE>   The billionaire said McCall is "part of the system ... and we need
to change it."</TE>
<TE>   Recent polls have shown incumbent Gov. George Pataki with
double-digit leads over McCall, the state comptroller, with Golisano
trailing in third place.</TE>
<TE>   Pataki aides had maintained they didn't care what Golisano did.
Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said that if Golisano quit the race
more of his support might go to McCall, but a good chunk would also
swing over to Pataki.</TE>
<TE>   "Tom Golisano's strange campaign is ending on a stranger note,"
said Pataki campaign manager Adam Stoll.</TE>
<TE>   A poll from the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion
released Wednesday had Pataki leading McCall, 47% to 27%, with
Golisano at 17%.</TE>
<TE>   With Golisano out of the race, Pataki led McCall, 54% to 33%,
according to the Marist pollsters.</TE>

<HD>Tallying Up Some of the Scores for This Election Season</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sure, they won't count the votes in the midterm election until
Tuesday. But why wait? As the band U2 once put it: You miss too much
these days if you stop to think.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the big questions -- like who won control of Congress and
the nation's governorships, and whether Florida has learned how to
count ballots -- can't be answered yet. But even before the results
are tallied, some of the winners and losers of this election season
are already clear. Here's a preliminary look:</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   WINNERS</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR Nation. It wasn't that long ago that every politician with
a pulse and a pollster was targeting soccer moms. Now the hot ticket
seems to be racetrack dads.</TE>
<TE>   Desperate to reverse their party's decline among rural voters,
Democratic Senate candidates from Erskine Bowles in North Carolina to
Jean Carnahan in Missouri have been tooling around with NASCAR
drivers, toting shotguns and ditching the Starbucks for Dr Pepper.
Sen. Zell Miller (D-Ga.), who isn't even on the ballot, set the tone
earlier this year when he took to the Senate floor to deliver a paean
to the pickup truck. (Unlike Bill Clinton, he didn't mention anything
about AstroTurf.)</TE>
<TE>   Think of the election as an episode of "Green Acres": Everyone is
siding with Eddie Albert over Eva Gabor.</TE>
<TE>   The gender realignment. Maybe this isn't news to any couple that's
ever tried to pick a movie on a Friday night, but the differences
between men and women are deep and lasting. Now they are hardening
into an irreversible feature of American politics. In 2000, Mars and
Venus elected different presidents: men backed George W. Bush and
women Al Gore, by equal 11-point margins. Late polls are finding
similar chasms in races around the country this year.</TE>
<TE>   Outside of the two coasts, it sometimes seems the only white men
who vote Democratic are either a) union members or b) university
professors. (Call it the AFL and NPR coalition.) In many places, it's
just as hard to find Republican voters among either a) single women
or b) married women who work outside the home. Depending on the
angle, Republicans have a woman problem, Democrats have a man
problem, or maybe men and women just have a problem with each other.</TE>
<TE>   Niche ideas. It hasn't been a fertile year for new ideas (in the
way the Dust Bowl years weren't fertile for the Great Plains). But
some fresh stalks poked through the arid policy debate. In half a
dozen governor's races, the first signs emerged of a backlash against
the reliance on standardized tests in education. Controlling the cost
of prescription drugs for all Americans appears poised to seize the
spotlight from expanding access to drugs for senior citizens. And
while old favorites like a patient's bill of rights faded, a new
health-care idea showed some traction: tax credits to help small
businesses insure their workers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LOSERS</TE>
<TE>   Fiscal sanity. Maybe some accounting firm -- or, on second
thought, somebody more trustworthy, like a bookie -- should have
donated a calculator to every contender for Congress this year.
Candidates in both parties have put forward agendas that simply don't
add up.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is both sides still want to party like it's 1999, when
the federal government was sitting on an ocean of cash. Now that the
war on terrorism, recession and President Bush's tax cut has thrown
the federal budget back into the red, neither party knows how to
adapt.</TE>
<TE>   Case in point: Social Security. For all the semantic quibbling
about whether it should be called privatization, most Republicans
still want to let younger workers divert some of their payroll taxes
into individual accounts they can invest in stocks and bonds. That
could cost as much as $1 trillion over the next decade. Where would
the money come from? Republican candidates like Senate hopeful
Elizabeth Hanford Dole in North Carolina have a ready answer: the
surplus temporarily accumulating in the Social Security account
before the baby boom retires.</TE>
<TE>   Memo to Liz: That money is already gone. Poof. Spent. The
Congressional Budget Office says that because the rest of the budget
has fallen so deeply into deficit, Washington needs almost all of the
Social Security surplus just to fund the federal government's routine
operations.</TE>
<TE>   That means individual accounts will require higher taxes, a larger
national debt, or big spending cuts elsewhere -- all of which
Republicans have left off their bumper stickers.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic math is even fuzzier. Almost every Democratic
Senate candidate in a competitive race this year has promised three
things: to support Bush's tax cut; to create a prescription drug
benefit under Medicare; and to block the use of Social Security money
to operate the rest of government.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is 1 and 2 make 3 impossible; to fulfill both of the
first two promises, Democrats would have to raid Social Security for
at least $2.5 trillion over the next decade, according to
Congressional Budget Office estimates. Incoherent is the most
charitable way to describe that collection of positions; mendacious
might be the most accurate.</TE>
<TE>   Meaningful House races. Bill Schneider, the waggish CNN political
analyst, says that in a democracy voters are supposed to pick the
politicians. But in the once-a-decade process of redistricting,
politicians get to pick the voters.</TE>
<TE>   This year, in states from coast to coast, politicians have used
that leverage to improve their job security by drawing congressional
districts that overwhelmingly favor one party or the other.</TE>
<TE>   The result is that there was genuine competition in only as few as
three dozen of the 435 House races. That means more than 9 in 10
Americans were denied the opportunity to cast a meaningful ballot for
the House. It's no exaggeration to call that a crime against
democracy -- one that ought to inspire demands for fundamental
redistricting reform.</TE>
<TE>   The decency caucus. Love his views or hate them, the late Paul
Wellstone brought decency and conviction to the Senate. He displayed,
and inspired, passion. Some voters in Minnesota thought he was a
liberal crank, others a progressive hero. Almost all agreed he was a
man who took his causes seriously and himself less so.</TE>
<TE>   What I'll remember most about Wellstone is when he walked through
the state fair in Minneapolis this summer, almost no one called him
senator, or even Mr. Wellstone. They just called him Paul.</TE>

<HD>A Comforting Spouse Could Turn Out to Be a Real Pain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Lee Hotz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Scientists have proved what so many have long suspected: The very
presence of your solicitous spouse can be a pain.</LD>
<LD>   By eavesdropping on electrical activity in the most private
precincts of the mind, researchers investigating the effects of
chronic pain discovered that a husband or wife can make the ache feel
three times worse simply by being in the room.</LD>
<LD>   All they had to do to make their spouses feel better, the neural
probes revealed, was leave.</LD>
<TE>   The new research, made public here Sunday at a meeting of 24,000
neuroscientists, offers the first clear neural evidence that social
experiences can directly alter the way the brain responds to the kind
of chronic pain experienced by more than 97 million people in the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   Chronic pain, the researchers concluded, can become embedded in
the give-and-take of a relationship, even at the fundamental level of
brain anatomy.</TE>
<TE>   "For the first time, we have discovered that a social variable,
namely the presence of a spouse, can influence the brain's response
to pain," said neuropsychologist Herta Flor of the University of
Heidelberg's Central Institute of Mental Health, who led the study
team.</TE>
<TE>   Presented during the annual meeting of the Society for
Neuroscience, the work is among a cascade of provocative insights
into how experience can alter the structure and responses of the
human brain.</TE>
<TE>   Neurons and neural circuits are constantly remodeling themselves
to accommodate the influence of experience, whether it is the
stimulation of computer games, too much stress or the actions of an
overly sympathetic helpmate, new research shows.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the experience of surgery during infancy can alter the
body's pain responses for a lifetime, researchers said Sunday.
Experimenting with laboratory mice, scientists at Haverford College
in Pennsylvania determined that untreated pain at birth lessens
sensitivity to pain later in life.</TE>
<TE>   "Our research in mice suggests that an adult's pain sensitivity
may be linked to past experiences with painful or stressful
experiences, including those that occur very early in life," said
Wendy Sternberg, whose laboratory conducted the experiments.</TE>
<TE>   To better understand the interplay between chronic pain and the
brain, Flor and her colleagues in Germany studied 20 couples in which
one partner suffered from severe chronic back pain.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers monitored the patient's brain activity with an
array of electrodes that recorded the involuntary physiological
responses of nerve cells and synapses. They then gave the patients
painful electric shocks to their aching backs and studied the brain's
responses.</TE>
<TE>   They found that some spouses measurably boosted the patient's
neural pain responses just by sitting near them in the laboratory.</TE>
<TE>   The sensors detected the heightened activity in a part of the
brain called the anterior cingulate cortex, which is associated with
the processing of pain.</TE>
<TE>   The effect occurred only when the spouse was in the room and only
when the painful shock was applied to the sore back, not to other
parts of the body.</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, perhaps, it was the most solicitous husbands and
wives -- those who clucked most lovingly over the spouses' discomfort
-- who triggered the pain. The more the husbands or wives dwelt on
their partner's pain, the worse it felt, the neural monitors showed.</TE>
<TE>   "We found basically that when their spouses were in the room, they
had an almost three-fold increase in their response to pain. These
patients also showed more overt signs of feeling pain, such as
moaning," Flor said.</TE>
<TE>   Those spouses, however, who responded to complaints by changing
the subject, by suggesting helpful but distracting activity or by not
dwelling too long on the pain did not elevate the neural responses.</TE>
<TE>   Through the feedback loops of a marriage or long partnership, the
patient's pain has shaped the helping behavior of the solicitous
spouse, who in turn has become a stimulus to provoke the pain.</TE>
<TE>   "The solicitous spouse has become a cue for a more intense pain
experience," Flora said. "When people pay too much attention to
another's pain, it tends to reinforce that pain. We forget to
reinforce those things that are not pain-related, like when a person
smiles."</TE>
<TE>   She suggested that treatment of chronic pain, therefore, ought to
involve husband and wife together, so they can focus on things that
counteract the pain.</TE>
<TE>   "I am fascinated by this," said Allan Basbaum, an expert on the
neurobiology of pain at UC San Francisco. "It points out why
persistent pain is so difficult to treat. The psychological
environment in which you live can influence the experience of pain."</TE>

<HD>Magnitude 7.9 Quake Rocks Alaska's Interior</HD>
<DH>The temblor in a lightly populated area 'shook for a good
30 seconds,' cracking highways and closing pipeline. Only one injury
is reported.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ANCHORAGE</DL>
<LD>A major earthquake rocked a sparsely populated area of interior
Alaska early Sunday afternoon, damaging supports to the trans-Alaska
oil pipeline and opening 6-foot cracks in highways and roads.</LD>
<LD>   The magnitude 7.9 quake, centered 90 miles south of Fairbanks, was
strongly felt in Anchorage, about 270 miles to the south. It hit at
1:13 p.m. Alaska Standard Time, said Bruce Turner of the West Coast &amp;
Alaska Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer.</LD>
<LD>   Only one injury was reported; a 76-year-old woman in Mentasta
broke her arm after slipping on stairs during the quake, said State
Patrol spokesman Greg Wilkinson.</LD>
<TE>   "It shook for a good 30 seconds," Turner said, adding that it did
not generate a tsunami.</TE>
<TE>   Support structures were damaged on the trans-Alaska oil pipeline,
but the pipeline itself was intact, said Mike Heatwole, spokesman for
the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co.</TE>
<TE>   The quake triggered a detection system, and operators manually
shut down the pipeline about 2 p.m., Heatwole said.</TE>
<TE>   In five locations, vertical support members, the H-shape devices
that hold the aboveground portions of the pipeline, were damaged. In
eight places, the "shoes" that connect the pipeline to the vertical
support members were on the ground, leaving the pipeline suspended,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Heatwole said company officials may know by midmorning today how
long it will take to restart the pipeline. He did not know whether
North Slope crude oil deliveries would be disrupted.</TE>
<TE>   The earthquake occurred on the Denali fault and had a shallow
depth, said John Lahr, geophysicist at the U.S. Geological Survey's
National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo. Shallow
earthquakes generally are felt over a wider area.</TE>
<TE>   Troopers responded to several reports of damaged roads in the
area, said Lt. Lee Farmer.</TE>
<TE>   Numerous roads developed wide cracks, including the Alaska Highway
near Northway, 256 miles southeast of Fairbanks. The Richardson
Highway, which parallels the trans-Alaska pipeline between Valdez and
Fairbanks, was closed near Paxson after gaps opened that were 2 to 6
feet wide and 5 feet deep, Wilkinson said.</TE>
<TE>   The worst reports of damage were along a 2-mile stretch of the Tok
Cutoff, which leads from the Alaska Highway to south-central highways
connected to Anchorage.</TE>
<TE>   There were hundreds of yards of 6-foot openings in the road and
numerous rock slides.</TE>
<TE>   Fuel tanks were knocked over in Slana, which has no electric
utility; families use diesel fuel to power generators.</TE>
<TE>   Sharrel Webster said she was likely to lose food in her freezer. A
semitrailer the family uses for storage tipped over on its side.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Capps, who owns a small grocery store midway between Tok and
Glennallen, said he felt a low-level shaking for 15 or 20 seconds
before the quake hit.</TE>
<TE>   "It shook so bad you could not stand up on the front porch," Capps
said. "It sounded like the trees were breaking roots under the
ground."</TE>
<TE>   Earthquakes above magnitude 7 are considered major -- capable of
widespread, heavy damage.</TE>
<TE>   A moderate earthquake shook the central Plains on Sunday. The 4.3
quake hit about 30 miles northwest of O'Neill, Neb., the geological
survey said.</TE>

<HD>Police Break Up Wisconsin Riot</HD>
<DH>Tear gas is used to stop bottle-throwing and looting at
annual party. At least 16 are arrested.</DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MADISON, Wis.</DL>
<LD>Police used tear gas and pepper spray early Sunday to quell a
disturbance that escalated into bottle-throwing and looting during a
Halloween party attended by about 65,000 people.</LD>
<LD>   More than 100 police helped break up the riot, and eight suffered
minor injuries, mainly from thrown objects, authorities said. At
least 16 people were arrested.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the first time I can remember that we ever had police
officers put on protective equipment, and I've been here since 1980,"
Madison Police Sgt. Patrick Grady said.</LD>
<TE>   The party is held each year on State Street, the city's main
thoroughfare.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the rampage began about 1:30 a.m., possibly after some
people began fighting with bottles. When police tried to help some
injured people, others threw bottles at them.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure alcohol had a big part of this," Grady said.</TE>
<TE>   People threw bottles at apartment windows, and some residents
retaliated with bottles, injuring at least two people, police said.</TE>
<TE>   For several hours, the crowd smashed windows in nine businesses
and looted two within a two-block area before police regained
control. Lt. Cameron McLay said those arrested were charged with
battery and looting.</TE>
<TE>   The huge crowd early Sunday included many out-of-towners.</TE>
<TE>   State Street was still closed late Sunday morning.</TE>

<DH>Former NFL referees make a whistle-stop trip to Oregon to
pay tribute to a courageous colleague</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>

<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>It was looking like one of the bad days for Vern Marshall. The day
before had been one of the good ones, when he felt well enough to
take a long walk. Now his pancreatic cancer was taking the upper hand
again, forcing him to stop on his way in to Lincoln High and throw
up.</LD>
<LD>   He kept going, because he was about to do what he always did:
referee a football game. This was his work for almost 50 years,
including 13 years in the NFL.</LD>
<LD>   "It's the only thing I ever did," Marshall, 67, said. "This has
been a lifelong deal for me."</LD>
<TE>   The vomiting had been going on for more than a month. At first he
thought he was simply sick. So did the doctors. But the vomiting
didn't stop. The doctors did exploratory surgery and made a
devastating discovery: Marshall had a baseball-sized tumor in his
stomach, and his life expectancy was one to 12 months.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, so many things have been going wrong with his body
that he probably thought he was hallucinating when he saw a familiar
face walk into the officials' dressing room Friday afternoon as he
prepared for the start of the Roosevelt-Madison game.</TE>
<TE>   That looked like Red Cashion, his former crew chief in the NFL.
And that guy behind him looked like Terry Gierke, another former NFL
crewmate. And wasn't that Jack Barger, the man who spent 25 years as
a Pacific 10 Conference official, the person who taught Marshall the
ropes?</TE>
<TE>   Then Cashion assured him it was reality, with that unmistakable
Texas twang: "We thought you could use a little help."</TE>
<TE>   Two more former NFL buddies, John Alderton and Nate Jones, came
through the door and suddenly there was 96 years of NFL officiating
experience in the room, preparing to work a game between two high
school teams with one victory between them.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really shocked," Marshall said a short while later. "I
didn't expect anything like this.</TE>
<TE>   "Just goes to show you how close the group is. There's nothing
closer than an officiating crew."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   You probably don't pay much attention to football officials. If
you do, it's to boo them, yell at them, maybe even throw things at
them.</TE>
<TE>   You don't think of them as people who get together and tell
stories, just like the rest of us. You never realize their ranks
include the likes of Vern Marshall, as dedicated, caring and
courageous as anyone who ever stepped on a football field.</TE>
<TE>   You can't count the number of kids he has helped as a high school
counselor and physical education coach, and it's just as hard to put
a figure on the number of young officials he has tutored.</TE>
<TE>   "He's an inspiration," said Tom Rinella, who officiates Portland
high school games.</TE>
<TE>   "I've known him for 30 years," said Bob Wellnitz, the commissioner
of the Portland Officials' Assn. "I've never heard him say anything
negative about anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps that trait wasn't the most helpful to Wellnitz when he
tried to evaluate officials. As he said, if Marshall came across a
bad teacher he'd probably say she had good bulletin boards.</TE>
<TE>   But there's no one Wellnitz would rather have working for him.</TE>
<TE>   "How many guys do you know that would work for the NFL and come
back to high school for an $1,100-a-game pay cut?" Wellnitz said.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall was a standout athlete in football, basketball and
baseball at Portland's Roosevelt High. Like most officials, he picked
up a whistle to stay involved in sports after his athletic ability
had taken him to its last stop.</TE>
<TE>   "He loves kids," said his wife, Tina Henderson. "He never really
wanted to coach, he wanted to officiate. That's always been his
passion, to give back to the community. He loves to start new guys
out and work with them. Just giving them the information that he
knows, that he can share."</TE>
<TE>   His No. 1 pupil has been his son, Vern Jr., 45.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I worked with him, I learned something new," Vern Jr.
said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Vern Sr. has worked a Super Bowl, his officiating dream
is to work a high school playoff game with his son.</TE>
<TE>   Friday, he got to work with a crew that included four retired NFL
referees. Cashion flew in from College Station, Texas, and Alderton,
a Portland native, came up from his home in Scottsdale, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   It was a surprise for Marshall. Wellnitz even went so far as to
assign a fake crew for the game, with members calling to check with
Marshall in the preceding days and sitting in the locker room up to
the minute the old-timers -- all retired, and ranging in age from the
50s to the 70s -- walked in.</TE>
<TE>   Gierke and Alderton came up with the idea soon after they learned
of Marshall's condition.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to think of some way we could show him how we felt about
him," Gierke said.</TE>
<TE>   They called Cashion, whose distinctive call of "First dowwwwn!"
made him one of the most recognizable referees, because they thought
it would be nice to have someone of his stature. When Alderton asked
him to be a part of it, Cashion responded with three words: "Count me
in."</TE>
<TE>   "All of us wanted to say, 'Vern, you're special,' " Cashion said.
"Any of the NFL officials would have said the same thing."</TE>
<TE>   Before the game they met up at Nick's Famous Coney Island, where
the walls are covered with sports pictures (heavy on the New York
Yankees) and the hot dogs are covered with chili (heavy on the
onions). It seemed as if everyone who entered or left the restaurant
stopped by to say hello to the guys.</TE>
<TE>   The refs called each other by colorful names, most unfit to print.</TE>
<TE>   They know they get calls wrong sometimes. (As Cashion said, "If
you're talking about an 'Oh, ... !' call, I've got a bunch of
those.") Jones thought Barger blew it when Barger officiated a game
in which Jones was a field-goal kicker and Barger called an attempt
no good.</TE>
<TE>   "I still think you might have missed that," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   They can joke about it now, but they take their duties very
seriously.</TE>
<TE>   "You're out there as a crew," Barger said. "The last thing anybody
wants to do is make an error. You form a bond within that group,
because it's like you're going to war, so to speak. It's you, in a
way, against the teams."</TE>
<TE>   "The third team," Cashion interjected.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a team unto ourselves," Gierke said. "That's where the bond
comes from."</TE>
<TE>   There's an extra touch of pride among the Portland-area officials.
A city with no NFL team somehow managed to put four officials into
the league. Marshall was the first.</TE>
<TE>   "He carried the torch," Alderton said.</TE>
<TE>   They were willing to do anything to honor him, even if it meant
taking a test. They had to be certified to work the game, and that
meant passing the 100-question quiz on high school rules.</TE>
<TE>   So they went into the closets and pulled out the old stripes. They
still fit. And they brought out Marshall's NFL-issue No. 94 line
judge uniform as well.</TE>
<TE>   On the way out to the field, another surprise awaited Marshall:
About 100 local officials, all wearing their black-and-white stripes,
lined the entrance to the field and applauded him every step of the
way.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he was very surprised," said Vern Jr., who worked the
game with his dad. "And I think he appreciated every moment of it.
The tears really welled up in his eyes."</TE>
<TE>   There were only 30 people in the stands, meaning this might have
been the first sporting event in which more people were on hand to
see the officials than the players.</TE>
<TE>   And it would be hard to call any of the players' performances more
impressive than Marshall's. Even though he was weak, even though he
had a tube sticking out of his body and a pouch tucked under his
clothes to collect fluids from surgery the week before.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall lasted only one series. But he got to call a penalty, and
got to raise his arms above his head to signal a touchdown. He came
to the sideline, where his son Joe wrapped a blanket around him, then
left the stadium after the first quarter when the chilly November air
became too much for him.</TE>
<TE>   He turned and waved his cap one last time.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of his buddies stuck around in the cold and finished the
game. Madison won, ending an 18-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   That would have been the story on any other day. But this day was
about the officials.</TE>
<TE>   So how was it for the "star" referee to work his first high school
game since 1971?</TE>
<TE>   "It was kinda like two Super Bowls rolled into one," Cashion said.
"It was an awesome experience.</TE>
<TE>   "But I still think walking onto the field and seeing all of
[Marshall's] fellow officials pay that tribute to him and clapping
and patting him on the back was just a very, very special thing. And
that means the people that have worked with him and know him locally
and all of the things that he's done really appreciate the things
he's done. That's what football officiating is all about."</TE>

<HD>Steele Is Fired as Baylor's Coach</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WACO, Texas</DL>
<LD>Baylor football Coach Kevin Steele was fired Sunday but agreed to
finish the season.</LD>
<LD>   Steele, in his fourth season at Baylor, is 9-33 and his teams have
won only one Big 12 conference game during his tenure. The Bears are
3-6 this season, including 1-4 in the Big 12.</LD>
<LD>   "It is with regret that I announce this move," Athletic Director
Tom Stanton said. "Kevin's efforts have made significant improvements
in many areas of our football program."</LD>
<TE>   Baylor lost to Texas Tech, 62-11, on Saturday. Since beating
Kansas, 35-32, on Oct. 5 to end their 29-game Big 12 losing streak,
the Bears have been outscored, 181-21, in four games, including
shutouts by Texas A&amp;M and Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   "I am disappointed that we were not able to meet the demands
placed upon the Baylor football program in the time allowed," Steele
said in a news release.</TE>
<TE>   Stanton said the school will begin the search for a successor over
the next few weeks and would not comment on the coaching situation
until after the season.</TE>
<TE>   "You can do all the rebuilding and coaching and recruiting that
you want, but there's some simple truths in coaching," Steele said.
"At some point as a football coach, you've got to win. If you don't
win enough, something may happen."</TE>
<TE>   The program was in bad shape when Steele arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Roberts briefly preceded Steele, going 4-18 in two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   The Bears' last winning season was 1995, when they went 7-4. Their
last bowl appearance was after the 1994 season when they lost, 10-3,
to Washington State in the Alamo Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Before coming to Baylor, Steele was an up-and-coming defensive
assistant, serving as linebackers coach with the NFL's Carolina
Panthers for four years.</TE>
<TE>   Before the stint with Carolina, he spent six years as linebackers
coach at Nebraska. During that time, the Cornhuskers went 60-11,
appeared in six bowl games and won a national title.</TE>

<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Chad Johnson guaranteed victory for the Cincinnati Bengals and
Artrell Hawkins helped make it happen.</LD>
<LD>   Energized by a 102-yard interception return by Hawkins and getting
four touchdown passes from Jon Kitna, the Bengals became the last NFL
team to get a victory this season, 38-3 Sunday over the Houston
Texans.</LD>
<LD>   The Bengals (1-7) have the worst record of any NFL team over the
last 12 seasons, but that didn't keep wide receiver Johnson from
guaranteeing they would defeat the expansion Texans (2-6).</LD>
<TE>   Johnson wasn't as boastful after the game, however. "It feels
good, but everyone misinterpreted the guarantee thing," Johnson said.
"I didn't mean any disrespect to the Texans. What I wanted to do was
add fuel to our fire, make a statement."</TE>
<TE>   Hawkins made a statement during the game. His first-quarter return
tied the longest play in Cincinnati history and put the Bengals ahead
for good.</TE>
<TE>   "All it was was a quick out route," Hawkins said. "I got a good
break on it and the rest is history."</TE>
<TE>   David Carr had thrown 97 consecutive passes without an
interceptions when Hawkins stepped in front of a pass for Jabar
Gaffney in the end zone and bolted down the sideline with a clear
field ahead of him. After appearing to step out of bounds at the
Houston 24, he cut back inside and his only pursuer was Carr, who
made a diving tackle attempt near the goal line.</TE>
<TE>   "Tony Boselli (an offensive lineman) caught me four years ago,"
Hawkins said. "I couldn't let this quarterback catch me."</TE>

<LD>Tim Sullivan in the San Diego Union-Tribune: "Daniel Snyder was
unavailable for comment. The owner of the Washington Redskins doesn't
do interviews during the season, or so his spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   "Pity, I had hoped to personally thank the little twerp for firing
Marty Schottenheimer. I wanted Danny boy to know just how well the
antiquated coach was working out in San Diego, and see if Steve
Spurrier might need any Super Bowl tickets....</LD>
<LD>   "Snyder is wealth without wisdom, power without prudence, a
clumsy, callous child in a game meant for grown-ups ... Snyder is
like George Steinbrenner without the championships, like Marge Schott

<TE>   Trivia time: Who were USC and UCLA's first consensus All-American
football selections?</TE>
<TE>   Green gimmick: Notre Dame's attempt to stimulate its players by
wearing green jerseys against Boston College on Saturday backfired
when the previously unbeaten Irish lost to the Golden Eagles, 14-7.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish have resorted to wearing green jerseys in the past,
notably against USC. In 1977, the Irish wore their traditional blue
and gold jerseys in warmups, then went to the locker room and changed
to green before the kickoff. Notre Dame then routed the Trojans,
49-19.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish went on to win the national championship.</TE>
<TE>   Hurry up and win: A few years ago, said Pat Forde on ESPN.com,
Kentucky basketball Coach Tubby Smith was hearing from angry fans on
a call-in radio show shortly after a loss.</TE>
<TE>   One caller, Forde said, sounded a hopeful note: "Coach, I just
want you to know I haven't given up on the team yet."</TE>
<TE>   Said Forde: "What faith. The Wildcats were 22-4 at the time."</TE>
<TE>   His appeal: Blackie Sherrod in the Dallas Morning News:
"Regardless of his aloofness, Major League Baseball should thank the
cash registers for Barry Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "Were it not for the slugger's box office intrigue, the Left Coast
Series might have been ignored by Madison Avenuers, from whom all
commercial blessings flow."</TE>
<TE>   Fun guys: Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle: "Halloween
story that didn't get the media coverage it deserved: Randy Moss is
treated for cuts and bruises after being run down by an SUV shortly
after trick-or-treating at Albert Belle's house."</TE>
<TE>   Add Ostler: "Bud Selig says it's undignified and dangerous to have
immature kids running around the dugout. So he's contracting the New
York Mets."</TE>
<TE>   For good reason: Bill Suda in the San Diego Union-Tribune: "The
Game 7 World Series headline nobody used: 'World Chimps.' "</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: USC halfback Mort Kaer in 1926 and UCLA end Burr
Baldwin in 1946.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Kansas City Chief Coach Dick Vermeil, a wine
connoisseur, was asked what drink he might compare to Jerry Rice.</TE>
<TE>   "Jerry Rice to me would be like a Bryant Family Vineyard Cabernet,

<HD>Red Flag Is Like a Go for Vasser</HD>
<DH>Restart at Fontana with two laps left paves way for him to
pass Andretti and win fastest 500-mile race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Shav Glick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>FONTANA</DL>
<LD>Jimmy Vasser, a man without a ride in motor racing in 2003, put an
exclamation point on his employment resume Sunday by winning the
fastest 500-mile race run by open-wheel cars.</LD>
<LD>   Vasser averaged a record 197.995 mph and led a record 148 of the
250 laps, but needed a dramatic pass of Michael Andretti on a restart
two laps from the finish to take the checkered flag for the Toyota
500 before an estimated 55,000 at California Speedway.</LD>
<LD>   He was driving a Ford-powered Lola for Bobby Rahal, but apparently
does not figure in Rahal's plans.</LD>
<TE>   Being in front for a restart -- the final one came after the race
was stopped when the engine on Dario Franchitti's Lola erupted in a
cloud of smoke on Lap 242 -- was not the best place to be.</TE>
<TE>   "Had it not been for Dario causing the red flag, it would have
been difficult to catch Michael under race conditions," Vasser said.
"Michael drove a great race. At the end, he was in a tough position.
The guy leading in that position is like a sitting duck out there."</TE>
<TE>   It was the first one-two finish for U.S. drivers since the Toyota
Grand Prix of Long Beach last April when it was Andretti winning and
Vasser second. They were the only Americans in the 18-driver field.
It was also Vasser's second win at California Speedway, having won in
1998. Vasser's speed eclipsed the 500-mile record of 189.727, set in
1990 in a CART race by Al Unser Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Cristiano da Matta, who clinched the Championship Auto Racing Team
championship several races ago, appeared to be on his way to an
eighth win this season and his second in a row at California Speedway
when the Toyota engine in his Chevron Lola let go on Lap 236.</TE>
<TE>   "To end the race this way was a huge disappointment for myself and
the team," Da Matta said. "We waited for this point in the race to
come before we went for it and everything was going as planned until
the car just lost power. I had no indication there was a problem."</TE>
<TE>   The Brazilian, who is headed for Formula One with Toyota next
year, led only 14 laps but seemed a likely winner after beating
Vasser out of the pits in a drag race a few laps earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Cristiano had a little left in his hip pocket because he
really started playing with me at the end," Vasser said. "He was
going to be tough to beat."</TE>
<TE>   When Da Matta caused a yellow caution flag, Andretti got the lead
on the restart by jumping Vasser before they reached the first turn.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I had the race won right there [after Da Matta
stopped]," said Andretti, "but then Dario's car lost a motor and I
became the sitting duck. What's fair is fair. The yellow [flag] came
out and cost Jimmy and the red flag came out and cost me.</TE>
<TE>   "The red flag is in the rule book, so it was the right decision.
I'm sure Jimmy loved the red flag. He probably had the best car and
deserved to win. I tried to catch him in Turns 3 and 4 at the end but
came up a little short. I radioed the crew, 'I'm done.' "</TE>
<TE>   It was the second time a CART race had been stopped for a red flag
this year. The first came at Vancouver where Franchitti won. Patrick
Carpentier, one of three Canadian drivers in the race, finished
third, but didn't challenge Vasser or Andretti.</TE>
<TE>   Although there were only 18 starters and the field at times looked
lost strung out around California Speedway's two-mile D-shaped oval,
there was enough excitement up front where the 225-mph front-runners
passed and re-passed one another 43 times in the 2-hour 33-minute
42.9-second race. Eight cars dropped out with mechanical problems,
but there was no car-crash accident.</TE>
<TE>   One of the strangest mishaps occurred to Bruno Junqueira on Lap 34
after what should have been a routine stop for tires and fuel. As he
exited his pit, the left rear tire came off and rolled all the way to
the grassy Turn 1 infield. The rear-wheel crewman, knowing the tire
was not on properly, frantically waved to hold Junqueira but it was
too late.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the Chip Ganassi crew retrieved the machine and bolted
on another tire, Junqueira had lost a lap, which he was unable to
regain.</TE>
<TE>   Vasser's crew won the Craftsman Pit Crew Challenge on Friday, and
Vasser credited them with helping him win Sunday. Statistics bore him
out as his seven stops averaged 39.058 seconds, compared with 40.966
for Andretti. Times are recorded from the moment the car enters and
exits the pit lane.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a great car today and a lot of the credit goes to the
Shell crew guys who busted their butts this week to put everything
together after Australia," Vasser said. "We had a big pile of junk
from last week," where Vasser was in the center of a nine-car pileup
in the rain.</TE>
<TE>   The tub of Vasser's car was flown in from Rahal headquarters in
Columbus, Ohio, on Tuesday and the crew -- after arriving from a
6,000-mile trip from Australia -- bolted it together in time for
Friday's practice.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the tightest side-by-side racing took place early in the
race when Andretti and Paul Tracy exchanged the lead 16 times in 51
laps before Tracy dropped out with mechanical gremlins.</TE>
<TE>   Oriol Servia, who started last and finished fifth, had the day's
fastest lap, 232.114 mph, on Lap 234. That was also the fastest lap
for Vasser (231.188), Andretti (231.101) and Da Matta (230.379).
Servia's lap, coming in traffic while he was in 11th place, was
faster than Tony Kanaan's pole-sitting speed of 232.011 set Saturday.</TE>

<LD>Oriol Servia didn't finish on the lead lap, but he did turn in one of
the best performances of the Toyota 500 at California Speedway. The
Spaniard started last in the 18-car field, but finished fifth Sunday
in owner Pat Patrick's Toyota-powered Reynard.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a good race, but it wasn't what I wanted," said Servia,
whose best finish this season was fourth at Rockingham Speedway in
England, also an oval. "I wanted a podium."</LD>
<LD>   Servia passed seven cars on the first lap, but was passed back by
two of them on the second lap before settling into his steady climb
through the field.</LD>
<TE>   "I didn't expect the start to be as critical [but] it wasn't as
easy as years past to pass," Servia said. "The start was very
important."</TE>
<TE>   Servia became unemployed when PWR Racing folded after three races.
He has raced nine times for Patrick, and this was his third top-10
finish, his second in the top five. He had the race's fastest lap,
232.114 mph, on Lap 234, almost a full mile an hour faster than
winner Jimmy Vasser. Servia might have challenged the leaders, but
was lapped during his last pit stop by race leader Cristiano da
Matta.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had known [Da Matta] was the leader, I would have put up a
fight for position," said Servia, who was told Da Matta was not the
leader because his crew misunderstood the question over the radio. "I
feel for sure we have the potential to win. Next year, I think we can
be a real contender."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The only crash was a memorable trip by Tora Takagi through the
pits -- backward.</TE>
<TE>   Takagi has been on crutches since he suffered a fractured pelvis
last week in a nine-car crash in Australia. Sunday, he locked the
brakes of his Toyota-Reynard and made soft contact with the pit stall
wall. Guided by the wall, he went neatly through more than a dozen
pit stalls, three of them occupied -- including his own, which was
laid out for a pit stop. Fortunately, Takagi was on a different pit
schedule because he had to replace a pop-off valve earlier in the
race.</TE>
<TE>   "He's in a lot of pain, but when he's driving, he doesn't feel it
that much," said his team owner, Derrick Walker. "He feels it more
going over bumps, which is why he had the problem driving into the
pits. I think he's in a lot more pain than he's admitting.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure Tora will go out the first day [at Mexico City in two
weeks] and see how he feels. If Tora's fit to drive, it's not an
issue ... but there are lots of drivers who would like to go and race
there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Max Papis, who lost his job when Sigma Autosport folded after five
races, is available. With two second-place finishes in the last three
years at California, Papis filled in for injured owner-driver Adrian
Fernandez. He started 10th and was running a solid sixth when his
Honda encountered engine problems on Lap 215. He finished 14th.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel I am an open-wheel driver [and] showed I'm a strong driver
and deserve a place [in the field]," he said. "If I have a contract
next week in [the NASCAR Busch Series], I'll sign it. You go where
people want you the most, and I feel pretty welcome in the NASCAR
paddock."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bruno Junqueira, who finished ninth, leads Patrick Carpentier by
three points and Dario Franchitti by 10 in a spirited battle for
second place in the championship. Carpentier finished third,
Franchitti 10th. Junqueira was seventh before the first round of pit
stops, but lost a wheel when he exited. He lost a lap, and was
penalized a lap. He finished three laps behind.</TE>

<HD>Clippers Lift Spirits</HD>
<DH>Their 74-72 win over Detroit is ugly, but it's their first
and they'll take it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What, the Clippers worry? It's early in their season. There's no
reason to panic. After all, there have only been a couple of
dispiriting games, not 10 or 15 or 20.</LD>
<LD>   All they needed was one victory -- no matter how ugly, no matter
how improbable -- to give them a jolt of confidence.</LD>
<LD>   All they needed was to hold the Detroit Pistons to four points in
the final 7 minutes 13 seconds and wrestle a 74-72 victory from them
Sunday afternoon in front of a crowd of 14,275 at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   Now, was that so difficult?</TE>
<TE>   "We needed a win in the worst way," Coach Alvin Gentry said with a
smile that was more like a grimace after the Clippers' first victory
in three games.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers made 22 of 69 shots (31.9%) and the Pistons made 26
of 81 (32.1%), which made for a brutal game. Suffocating defense
played a role, but each team missed its share of open shots.</TE>
<TE>   Clifford Robinson had a chance to give the Pistons a win and a 3-0
start, but his open three-point shot glanced off the rim at the final
buzzer. Earlier, Corliss Williamson missed a chance to tie the score,
when an alert Michael Olowokandi blocked his driving attempt with
48.7 seconds remaining, and Jon Barry's jumper from the left corner
missed the mark with a little more than a minute left.</TE>
<TE>   And so it went for the Pistons, whose only points in the final
7:13 came on Williamson's reverse layup that gave them a 70-66 lead
and Richard Hamilton's jumper that put them up, 72-70, with 3:36 to
play.</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi made a free throw, Corey Maggette converted a layup
after Elton Brand took out a press-row TV monitor while saving a
loose ball on the sideline, and Brand made a free throw.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers made a 74-72 lead stand up for the final 1:27.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that's one of those games they'll put in a time
capsule and lock up to show people 100 years from now," Gentry said.</TE>
<TE>   An unlikely group got the Clippers their first victory in three
games.</TE>
<TE>   Desperate for a second-half spark, Gentry put guards Andre Miller,
Keyon Dooling and Marko Jaric on the floor with Olowokandi and backup
center Wang Zhizhi. With the Clippers down, 55-49, late in the third
quarter, those five began to chip away at the deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Jaric slipped a pretty pass to Olowokandi for a dunk, then made
two free throws. Wang made a jump shot and Dooling made a
three-pointer. Suddenly, the Clippers had their first lead of the
game, and their first since leading the Lakers, 5-4, moments into
their game Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "Wang, Marko and Keyon gave us huge minutes," Olowokandi said.
"It's all about opportunities. Those three gave us big minutes."</TE>
<TE>   At the end, Gentry put Brand and Maggette back in the game and the
momentum carried over, fueled by the best defense the Clippers have
played in three games. After all, they gave up 98 points on opening
night to the Cavaliers and 108 to the Lakers, who were without
Shaquille O'Neal (toe) and Rick Fox (suspension).</TE>
<TE>   The only glaring breakdown during the final minutes came on
Robinson's three-point try at the buzzer. Brand missed a short jumper
and the Pistons rebounded and called a timeout with five seconds
left. Two Clippers then went to cover Williamson in the corner,
leaving Robinson alone beyond the three-point arc.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson's shot missed the mark and there was an audible sigh of
relief from the crowd and from the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anybody in this locker room was prepared to talk
about an 0-3 start," said Olowokandi, who had 19 points and tied a
career high with 20 rebounds in 45 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't want to go on the road 0-3," said Brand, who added 17
points and 13 rebounds in 35 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers begin a four-game trip Wednesday against the 76ers at

<TE>   "We stayed positive," Brand said when asked about the team's state
of mind as it fell behind by as many as 14 points before rallying in
the third quarter. "Coach told us not to panic and we didn't.
Finally, something went right for us. Finally, there's something to
smile about."</TE>

<LD>The Clippers' 74-72 victory Sunday over the Detroit Pistons did not
come without a price. Guard Quentin Richardson suffered a
hyperextended right knee in the first half and his status for the
Clippers' next game Wednesday against the Philadelphia 76ers is
uncertain. Richardson left Staples Center under his own power.</LD>
<LD>   Richardson suffered a sprained right knee Oct. 4 while running
during conditioning drills at training camp in Palm Desert. He sat
out all but the last of the Clippers' eight exhibitions and wasn't
productive in any of their first three games. He missed three shots
and did not score in 13 minutes Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   After starting the first two games at shooting guard, Richardson
returned to a reserve role Sunday in a 74-72 victory over the
Pistons.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't know what his status is right now," Coach Alvin Gentry
said.</TE>
<TE>   Without Richardson, Gentry went with a three-guard offense for
most of the second half. At times, he played Andre Miller, Marko
Jaric and Keyon Dooling together. At others, he used Miller, Dooling
and Corey Maggette.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers leave Tuesday for a trip to play the 76ers, the New
Jersey Nets, Orlando Magic and Miami Heat.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This wasn't the first time the Clippers clamped down on the
Pistons in the fourth quarter to pull out a victory. In fact, it was
their second such win in a row over Detroit at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, the Clippers rallied from a 13-point deficit in the
fourth quarter to eke out an 82-77 victory. This time, the Clippers
held the Pistons to four points in the final 7:13 to steal their
first victory in three games this season.</TE>

<LD>A shaky win by Miami against one of the worst teams in the country
became a big loss Sunday -- the Hurricanes are out as No. 1.</LD>
<LD>   Oklahoma replaced Miami as the top team in the Associated Press
media poll, ending the Hurricanes' record run of 21 consecutive polls
at No. 1. Miami takes over the No. 2 spot formerly held by the
Sooners.</LD>
<LD>   Miami improved to 8-0 with its 42-17 win over Rutgers (1-8), but
trailed by three points entering the fourth quarter. Oklahoma moved
to 8-0 with a 27-11 win over Colorado (6-3), ranked No. 13 before the
game.</LD>
<TE>   Oklahoma moved ahead of defending national champion Miami by 14
points in balloting by the 74 sportswriters and broadcasters on the
AP panel.</TE>
<TE>   The Sooners received 42 first-place votes and 1,818 points, to
Miami's 32 first-place votes and 1,804 points.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma picked up 28 first place-votes from a week ago -- 27 from
Miami and one from Notre Dame, which fell to No. 9 from No. 4 after a
14-7 loss to Boston College.</TE>
<TE>   Four teams remain unbeaten -- the top three of Oklahoma, Miami and
Ohio State and No. 21 Bowling Green.</TE>
<TE>   The defending national champion Hurricanes retained their No. 1
spot in the USA Today/ESPN coaches poll.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wisconsin running back Anthony Davis was stabbed in the left thigh
Sunday morning during a domestic dispute. Police were called to an
apartment in Madison, Wis., after a report of a domestic disturbance.
They found Davis with a deep puncture wound in the middle of his
thigh. A 22-year-old woman was arrested on a tentative charge of
second-degree recklessly endangering safety, police said.... Michigan
State tailback Dawan Moss was dismissed from the team after being
arrested Saturday night in East Lansing and accused of dragging a
police officer with his car after a traffic stop. The 22-year-old
Moss, one of the Spartans' captains, was charged with fleeing and
eluding a police officer -- a felony -- as well as misdemeanor
drunken driving and having an open container of alcohol.... Timmy
Chang passed for 365 yards and three touchdowns to lead Hawaii to a
40-31 victory over San Jose State on Saturday night in Honolulu. The
Warriors (7-2) became the first team in the nation to clinch a bowl
bid. With seven wins, they are guaranteed to play host to a team from
Conference USA in the Hawaii Bowl on Christmas.</TE>

<LD>   Where: ESPN, Tuesday, 7 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   Three cheers for ESPN. The network's investigative series offers a
one-hour special that takes an in-depth look at the positive and
negative aspects of cheerleading.</TE>
<TE>   The opening segment focuses on the cheerleading squad at Louisiana
State, regarded as one of the best in the country. Viewers learn
about the rigors and demands of being a college cheerleader.</TE>
<TE>   Reporter Shelley Smith offers a powerful segment on the dangers of
cheerleading. Nearly 25,000 cheerleading injuries required emergency
room care last year.</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska no longer allows aerial maneuvers after one of its
cheerleaders was seriously injured six years ago, resulting in a
$2-million legal settlement. This segment also includes interviews
with Dale Baldwin, a male Kentucky cheerleader paralyzed in 1986, and
the sister of Janis Thompson, a North Dakota State cheerleader killed
doing a stunt in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   A segment called "Pompom Gate" features Newport Harbor High in
Newport Beach and the latest cheerleading controversy at that school.
A protest last year over the selection of cheerleaders led to hurt
feelings and lost friendships -- and the creation of an offshoot
squad promoted by radio personality Rick Dees.</TE>
<TE>   "Outside the Lines" host Bob Ley, in another segment, discusses
how cheerleading has grown into a big business that includes
cheerleading camps and televised national competitions.</TE>
<TE>   Three NFL cheerleading squads are featured -- all for different
reasons.</TE>
<TE>   There's a look back at the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders, who started
the cheerleading craze in the NFL. There's a report on the lawsuit
filed earlier this year by more than 100 Philadelphia Eagle
cheerleaders against 29 teams claiming players had been spying on
them in their locker room through holes in the visitor's locker room
since 1983. And there's a piece on what it takes to become a
Raiderette.</TE>

<KH>DETROIT 9, DALLAS 7</KH>
<HD>Lions Have a Better Idea at Ford</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>The Detroit Lions aren't a great team by any means, but at home
they've been good enough to already surpass last season's victory
total.</LD>
<LD>   Jason Hanson kicked his third field goal, from 43 yards, with 48
seconds left to help the Lions defeat the Dallas Cowboys, 9-7,
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "We've got a three-game winning streak at home, and that's a big
statement these players have made," said Detroit Coach Marty
Mornhinweg, who was 2-14 in his first season.</LD>
<TE>   The Lions (3-5) have lost all 12 of the road games they've played
under Mornhinweg, but in their first season at Ford Field, they've
beaten New Orleans, Chicago and the Cowboys (3-6).</TE>
<TE>   Joey Harrington, Detroit's rookie quarterback, struggled much of
the game, but his longest completion of the game -- a 13-yard play to
James Stewart -- on fourth and three from the Dallas 43 kept the
game-winning drive going. Harrington completed three of four passes
on the drive, which began on the Lion 37, and Stewart ran four times
to set up the field goal.</TE>
<TE>   Harrington was 14 for 33 for 104 yards with two interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   "You can call it ugly, you can call it whatever you want, but we
won, we won, we won," said Harrington.</TE>
<TE>   One week after breaking Walter Payton's NFL record for career
rushing yardage, the Cowboys' Emmitt Smith ran for only 39 yards in
16 carries. Smith has 16,782 yards in a 13-season career.</TE>
<TE>   Troy Hambrick replaced Smith on third-and-short situations and
scored the only touchdown for the Cowboys -- a three-yard run that
put them ahead 7-6 with 7:42 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas had two possessions after that, but couldn't get a first
down.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With each game, rookie Stanislav Chistov seems to improve and his
play Sunday against San Jose gained solid reviews from his teammates
and first-year Coach Mike Babcock.</LD>
<LD>   Chistov skated 21 shifts against the Sharks and was on the ice for
nearly 13 minutes. He finished with five shots on goal, all in the
first period, including a score 19 seconds into the game.</LD>
<LD>   "He's an unbelievable player who's getting better all of the
time," Babcock said about Chistov, who has three goals and eight
points this season. "He had a real special first period."</LD>
<TE>   Added winger Petr Sykora: "He's one of the most skilled players
that I've seen in a long time."</TE>
<TE>   Chistov's goal was the fastest scored by a Mighty Duck at home in
franchise history and the third fastest ever. Paul Kariya needed
eight seconds to score a goal at Colorado on March 9, 1997, and Steve
Rucchin scored 16 seconds into a game at Calgary on Jan. 15, 1997.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pierre Gauthier, who was fired as president and general manager of
the Ducks after last season, attended Sunday's game as a scout....
The Ducks honored the World Series champion Angels during a pregame
ceremony and had the World Series trophy on display on the main level
of the Arrowhead Pond.</TE>

<HD>Ducks Get Monkey Business, Not Rally</HD>
<DH>An apparent goal by Sykora is disallowed and Anaheim ends
up losing to San Jose, 4-3.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maybe it's time for the Mighty Ducks to start borrowing the Angels'
rally monkey for good luck, because the breaks they got Sunday night
against San Jose had the smell of a rally skunk.</LD>
<LD>   "Things are not going easy for us," said winger Petr Sykora, who
had a game-tying third-period goal called off in a 4-3 loss to the
Sharks.</LD>
<LD>   "We have to work for every single goal and every single point.
Today was another good example for us where we worked very hard as a
team but we just didn't get the bounces."</LD>
<TE>   With a chance to extend their modest unbeaten streak to three
games, the Ducks played well enough to win but came up short against
the Sharks, who won behind two goals by Mike Ricci and 16 saves by
Evgeni Nabokov.</TE>
<TE>   The turning point came midway in the third period when Sykora
deflected in an apparent goal off a blue line shot by defenseman
Ruslan Salei that would have tied the score, 3-3.</TE>
<TE>   But referee Mike Hasenfratz saw things differently and ruled that
Salei redirected the puck with a high stick and took away the goal.</TE>
<TE>   "If that's a goal ... it's a totally different game," said Sykora,
who scored his fourth goal this season in the second period.</TE>
<TE>   "I tipped the puck and thought for sure that it was a goal. It
happened really quickly. You have to ask the officials about what
happened but in my belief, it was a goal."</TE>
<TE>   After Hasenfratz waved off Sykora's goal, the Ducks had a little
letdown and found themselves playing shorthanded less than three
minutes later when defenseman Niclas Havelid was called for hooking.</TE>
<TE>   That penalty set up Ricci's second power-play goal of the game,
which put the Sharks ahead, 4-2, at 14:41.</TE>
<TE>   Center Steve Rucchin cut San Jose's lead in half when he scored
his fourth goal this season at 15:07, but the Ducks (3-6-3) couldn't
get any closer.</TE>
<TE>   "We did a lot of good things and that's the frustrating part,"
Duck Coach Mike Babcock said. "We're trying to build confidence and
we feel that we should have gotten points tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Although the game was not a sellout, with an announced crowd of
15,157, the Arrowhead Pond was a noisy place, thanks to thousands of
noise sticks given to everyone in attendance.</TE>
<TE>   And the Ducks gave the crowd something to cheer for early when, on
the first shift, rookie Stanislav Chistov scored his third goal 19
seconds into the game.</TE>
<TE>   Chistov caught the Sharks sleeping when he gathered in a pass from
Havelid near the blue line on the left side, skated in front of San
Jose's Bryan Marchment and scored against Nabokov.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks continued to control play in the first period but were
still tied at the first intermission after former Duck Teemu Selanne
scored for San Jose at 13:17 with an assist from Patrick Marleau.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose took its first lead in the second period when Owen Nolan
skated around defenseman Fredrik Olausson, who returned to the lineup
after being benched for two games, and scored a short-handed goal at
7:14.</TE>
<TE>   The Sharks' lead lasted only 15 seconds and was erased by Sykora,
who scored on a power play after a great pass from Kariya to tie the
score, 2-2.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, however, surrendered the lead before the period ended,
thanks to a cross-checking penalty called on Olausson.</TE>
<TE>   Ricci was able to score his first power-play goal when he
redirected a blue line shot by Mike Rathje to put the Sharks ahead,
3-2, at 17:09.</TE>

<HD>Irish's Debacle in Green Rubs Off on Some Others</HD>

<LD>Never again (this week) will we second-guess Coach Tyrone
Willingham's aesthetic license, a la Oscar de la Renta, to outfit his
runway models any way he sees fit, because it turns out the green
jerseys Notre Dame broke out for the all-important Boston College
loss Saturday may have contained a magical, time-release formula.</LD>
<LD>   No wonder they're selling T-shirts on campus that proclaim "If
there's a Willingham, there's a way," even if that route is now the
hard way.</LD>
<LD>   The donning of Irish jerseys may end up making Mr. Blackwell's
list for Worst BCS Fashion Decisions, for this outbreak of Green
Sleeves led only to a five-turnover, on-field disaster.</LD>
<TE>   "Have they lost with the green jerseys?" Boston College Coach Tom
O'Brien quipped after the Eagles' 14-7 upset win in South Bend, Ind.</TE>
<TE>   Uh, yeah, in fact the last time the Irish wore green, at the 1999
Gator Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "So I guess it doesn't make any difference," O'Brien said.</TE>
<TE>   Point taken, yet as Irish players left Notre Dame Stadium
believing their hopes for a national title had been dashed, the green
pixie dust started dropping on undefeated teams around the country.</TE>
<TE>   At night's end, four of the eight undefeated schools had been
defeated, completely retouching the national-title picture and
putting the Irish back in focus.</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina State lost while the sun was still out, but it was
two under-the-light upsets, Pittsburgh over Virginia Tech and Florida
over Georgia, that opened an avenue for a one-loss team making it to
the Jan. 3 Fiesta Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's college carnage left Oklahoma, Miami and Ohio State as
the only undefeated teams in the chase -- Bowling Green is 8-0 but
doesn't have enough schedule muscle to make a bowl championship
series fight.</TE>
<TE>   The Buckeyes were the weekend's big winners, likely to jump to at
least No. 3 in today's third BCS rankings, with a chance to
eventually surpass No. 2 Miami, which stayed at No. 1 in the coaches'
poll but fell to second in the writers'.</TE>
<TE>   If two of the three undefeated schools in the hunt lose a game in
the next month, the No. 2 slot in the Fiesta Bowl will go to a
one-loss team, and who's to say that team could not be 11-1 Notre
Dame?</TE>
<TE>   Even before the losses suffered by Virginia Tech and Georgia put
Notre Dame back in the equation, Willingham predicted the Irish had
not fumbled (seven times) their chances.</TE>
<TE>   "Really, amazingly, we don't have to change our focus," he said.
"That may alarm some of you."</TE>
<TE>   It five-alarmed some of us, to be honest, but that's why
Willingham is coach of college football's premier program and we're
not.</TE>
<TE>   With the title race as wide open as a romp through the Kansas
secondary, here are the important dates to watch in the coming weeks:</TE>
<TE>   Nov. 9 -- Miami at Tennessee. Miami has won 30 consecutive games
but has looked vulnerable of late, most recently playing footsie with
Rutgers for three quarters Saturday before winning, 42-17. Tennessee
isn't all that anymore, but you can bet the Volunteers will do
everything they can next weekend to protect Fort Knoxville.</TE>
<TE>   Nov. 23 -- Michigan at Ohio State. The Buckeyes figure to be 12-0
headed into this annual scrum, at Columbus this year. Michigan has a
history of knocking Ohio State out of the national-title picture -- a
major reason why John Cooper is no longer coach.</TE>
<TE>   Nov. 30 -- Oklahoma at Oklahoma State. You laugh, but last year,
in Norman, Oklahoma State handed the defending national champions a
shocking defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Nov. 30 -- Notre Dame at USC. If the BCS winds change direction
again, the Irish could still be headed to Los Angeles with a
national-title berth at stake, although seven points on offense
doesn't figure to cut it against USC. In the Pacific 10 Conference,
see, teams score these things called "touchdowns."</TE>
<TE>   Dec. 7 -- Virginia Tech at Miami. Assuming Miami survives next
week's trip to Tennessee and remains undefeated, Virginia Tech gets a
last chance to scramble the final BCS standings, which will be
released Dec. 8.</TE>
<TE>   Dec. 7 -- Okahoma vs. Colorado (Big 12 title game). This is the
way the Big 12 title game is shaping up. Ask Texas if rematch games
are killers. Last year, the Longhorns beat Colorado, 41-7, in the
regular season but lost to the Buffaloes in the Big 12 championship.
All it cost Mack Brown's team was a chance to play Miami for the
national title.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, Oklahoma took care of Colorado in Norman, but the
rematch would be played, yee-ha, at a neutral site in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Dec. 7 -- Washington State at UCLA. The schools moved this game to
accommodate ABC; it could turn out to be a ratings winner if the
Cougars need the win to clinch the Rose Bowl. If things go completely
nuts, there may be a scenario in which one-loss Washington State is
playing for a berth in the Fiesta Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Weekend Wrap</TE>
<TE>   Never doubt the resourcefulness of college kids. Needing to let
off steam in the wake of the big win over Notre Dame in South Bend,
Boston College fans in Chestnut Hill wanted to tear down the goal
posts at Alumni Stadium, but the gates were locked. So, they tore
down the practice field goal posts.</TE>
<TE>   You can never tell what's going to happen in college football.
Washington State had a horrible week, starting Oct. 26 when players
and coaches were stranded in Tucson after playing Arizona because the
team plane had blown a tire. A flu outbreak then swept through the
squad and, as a capper, two defensive starters were lost after a
locker room altercation over a girl. Is this any way to win the
Pac-10 title? Apparently so, as the Cougars took sole possession of
first place with a wipeout win over Arizona State on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   With his 250-yard, three touchdown performance, Washington State
quarterback Jason Gesser has probably worked his way back into
Heisman Trophy contention. Also look for USC quarterback Carson
Palmer's name to start appearing on the Heisman short list.</TE>
<TE>   First-year Florida Coach Ron Zook has taken plenty of heat this
year in Gainesville, but he has a chance to hit for the cycle in
victories that matter most to Gator fans. Florida has defeated
Georgia and Tennessee, with three-loss Florida State still to come.</TE>

<KH>PHILADELPHIA 19, CHICAGO 13</KH>
<HD>Defense Bears Down in Time for Eagles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHAMPAIGN, Ill.</DL>
<LD>The relentless Philadelphia Eagles' defense had trouble digging in
Sunday because the Chicago Bears were making them guess.</LD>
<LD>   Included in the Bears' arsenal of surprises was a no-huddle
offense and a play that allowed their best receiver, Marty Booker, to
throw a pass.</LD>
<LD>   But in the second half, the Eagles showed why they have one of the
best defenses in the NFL.</LD>
<TE>   Hugh Douglas made a late sack on Jim Miller and the Eagles stopped
a last second-drive to shut out the Bears in the second half and
preserve a 19-13 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "They kept us off-balance for the whole first half. We just had to
calm down," Douglas said. "We played two quarters of defensive
football. The first two quarters weren't very good, but we came
together."</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia has given up 13 or fewer points five times this
season.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas, who knocked Miller out of a playoff game in January by
slamming him to the turf during an interception return, sacked the
quarterback on a third down play from the Eagle 24 with 17 seconds to
go.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, returning after missing two starts because of a sore
shoulder and elbow, then threw a fourth-down pass that was too high
for Marcus Robinson as the Bears (2-6) lost their sixth straight.</TE>
<TE>   "The route was designed to go to the back of the end zone. It
wasn't a good decision," Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   "The last drive they were getting a couple of chunks here and
there. It felt good to just stand up and make four straight plays
that didn't let them get in," Eagle linebacker Ike Reese said.</TE>
<TE>   The second half was completely frustrating for the Bears, who
managed 53 total yards -- 32 on the final drive -- after gaining 207
in the first two quarters.</TE>
<TE>   David Akers kicked four second-half field goals when the Eagles
(6-2) struggled to find the end zone, but still overcame a 13-7
halftime deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Donovan McNabb ran for 46 yards in nine carries and completed 18
of 33 passes for 209 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Penalties were also a big problem. Chicago was called 12 times for
121 yards, nine against its defense. "There were questionable calls
all day long. It's pathetic," defensive back R.W. McQuarters said.</TE>

<HD>Tates Creek Edges Voodoo Dancer Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Mieszerski</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Compared to the last time Tates Creek and Voodoo Dancer had met, the
$200,000 Las Palmas Handicap on Sunday at Santa Anita was a laugher.</LD>
<LD>   A nose better than Voodoo Dancer in a memorable Diana Handicap on
July 27 at Saratoga, Tates Creek, the 9-5 second choice, prevailed by
a neck over his rival this time around as the Oak Tree meet
concluded.</LD>
<LD>   Owned and bred by Juddmonte Farms and trained by Bobby Frankel,
Tates Creek, a 4-year-old Rahy filly, rallied inside under jockey
Jerry Bailey to win the Grade II after the runner-up and 11-10
favorite had moved prematurely to the lead, opening a two-length
advantage with an eighth of a mile to go.</LD>
<TE>   This was the eighth win in 12 starts for Tates Creek, who
completed the 1 1/8 miles on turf in 1: 47 3/5.</TE>
<TE>   She has won in three of four collaborations with Bailey, in his
customary spot atop the national jockey standings with almost $22
million in purse earnings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The longest shot in the field at 68-1 in the $111,700 Morvich
Handicap, Master Belt made a successful U.S. debut on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   A New Zealand-bred son of Masterclass, the 4-year-old gelding
rallied strongly in the final eighth of a mile to beat 9-2 third
choice I Love Silver by a neck in 1:12 1/5 for the about 6 1/2
furlongs on turf.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Breeders' Cup pick six scandal has accomplished something rare
-- getting racetrack managements to work together.</TE>
<TE>   In a jointly-released statement, North America's three largest
horse racing organizations -- Magna Entertainment, which owns Santa
Anita and Gulfstream, among others, Churchill Downs Inc., which runs
Hollywood Park and various other tracks, and the New York Racing
Assn. -- said they have instituted new measures to increase
totalisator security.</TE>
<TE>   The measures were brought about due to the ongoing investigation
involving two men and a very suspicious winning pick six ticket in
last weekend's Breeders' Cup at Arlington Park. The belief is Derrick
Davis of Baltimore made a $12 pick six bet --at a total cost of
$1,152 -- and that Chris Harn, who was fired by Autotote last
Thursday, later altered the ticket after four races had been run.
Records show that Davis and Harn both attended Drexel University and
were reportedly, for a time, fraternity brothers.</TE>
<TE>   Magna, Churchill Downs and NYRA said they are working with
Autotote and other totalisator companies and regulatory agencies to
guarantee internal controls are being maintained, ensure the physical
security of all on-site tote facilities and perform background checks
on all employees with access to those facilities.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jack Carava led all trainers at Oak Tree with 14 victories, five
more than Bob Baffert while Laffit Pincay, Jr. topped the jockeys
with 27 wins, one more than Patrick Valenzuela and two more than
David Flores. It was the third consecutive year Pincay has led at Oak
Tree and it was the 43rd riding title of his career.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On-track daily attendance at the meet was down 3.76% from last
year and Oak Tree director and executive vice-president Sherwood
Chillingworth cited conflicts with the Angels during their playoff
and World Series run along with USC and UCLA having home games on the
same Saturday during the 26-day meet.</TE>
<TE>   The California Cup also didn't fare nearly as well as last year.
The on-track attendance of 27,901 was down almost 10,000 from 2001.
Of course, account wagering was not available last year.</TE>
<TE>   "We were very disappointed," said Chillingworth. "We expected
40,000."</TE>

<LD>When Fullerton Eastside Christian bolted to a 20-0 lead over Express
League rival Huntington Beach Liberty Christian on Saturday night,
Eastside Christian Coach Mike Blankenship thought he was going to be
able to quickly turn his attention to more important matters than an
eight-man football game.</LD>
<LD>   His wife, Natalie, was waiting for him at the hospital after
undergoing a Cesarean section the night before to deliver premature
twins. Blankenship was eager to check on his new sons, Elijah and
Brea, who were in intensive care, and spend a tender moment with his
wife on their sixth wedding anniversary.</LD>
<LD>   As it turned out, Liberty Christian was not in a cooperative mood.</LD>
<TE>   The Minutemen rallied to take Eastside Christian into double
overtime before emerging with a 72-70 victory when Liberty Christian
quarterback Pat Doney scored on a two-point conversion run at Murdy
Park in Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of surreal," Blankenship said. "We were up 20-0 and I
thought we had the game."</TE>
<TE>   Luckily for Blankenship, things went more smoothly at the
hospital, where his wife and children were making quick recoveries.</TE>
<TE>   Eastside Christian looked as if it had secured the victory on the
last play of regulation when a flock of defenders converged on Doney,
only to watch him complete a wobbly pass to Mark Becklund in the end
zone.</TE>
<TE>   The teams traded touchdowns in the first and second overtimes, but
Eastside Christian was unable to convert a two-point conversion run
in the second extra period when Liberty Christian defenders stuffed
quarterback Matt Ellis.</TE>
<TE>   The teams combined for 994 yards of offense. Liberty Christian
freshman David Burch rushed for a school-record 351 yards and three
touchdowns, and brother Brandon added 123 yards and two touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Ellis threw for four touchdowns and rushed for five, racking up
375 all-purpose yards for Eastside Christian. T.J. Fakehinde caught
three touchdown passes and ran for another score.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Santa Fe Springs Santa Fe rang its victory bell earlier than usual
while defeating previously unbeaten Whittier Pioneer in a key Del Rio
League game at Pioneer.</TE>
<TE>   The large copper-and-iron relic, which looks and sounds as if it
hails from a 19th-century schoolhouse, usually sits in the school's
main office and is sounded during the "nutrition break" on Mondays
following each Chief victory.</TE>
<TE>   But Santa Fe wheeled the bell onto its sideline for the big game
against Pioneer, then ranked No. 1 in the Southern Section Division
VII poll. Santa Fe, the defending league champion, was ranked No. 2.</TE>
<TE>   As the final seconds of its 35-16 victory ticked off the clock,
Santa Fe obliged its fans' chants of "Ring the bell! Ring the bell!"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Play-calling signals aren't the only ones being traded along the
Pioneer sideline.</TE>
<TE>   Franky Duarte, a junior wide receiver and defensive back for the
Titans, is deaf and requires the services of an American Sign
Language interpreter to communicate messages from coaches and
teammates during games.</TE>
<TE>   College students Randy Salazar, Andi Montgomery and Cyndy Parral,
who are either certified sign-language interpreters or obtaining
their certification, take turns walking alongside Duarte, signing
when needed.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess it was like my first language," said Salazar, a sophomore
at El Camino College whose parents and sister are deaf. "Whenever the
coach wants Franky to go in, we tell him, and help them communicate."</TE>
<TE>   The interpreters work at Pioneer throughout the week as
translators in classes for Duarte and nine other deaf students.</TE>
<TE>   Duarte, the only deaf student on the football team, is a transfer
from La Mirada, where he played on the junior varsity team last year.</TE>
<TE>   A reserve at Pioneer, Duarte saw limited action on punt returns
and at receiver against Santa Fe.</TE>
<TE>   When he is on the field, Duarte relies on teammates, who point on
the plays scrawled on their wristbands in the huddle.</TE>
<TE>   "He usually gets it, so we don't have to be on the field," Salazar
said. "He knows what's going on."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chino running back Jacob Flowe may require surgery to repair
pelvic injuries suffered in a car accident Thursday that forced him
to miss the Cowboys' 21-14 loss to Chino Hills Ayala. Flowe was not
seriously injured in the accident, which required him to be
hospitalized for two nights as a precaution.</TE>
<TE>   "I was blessed," said Flowe, who suffered a cut above his right
eye. "Just a couple of scratches and bruises."</TE>
<TE>   Flowe said his car was totaled after being hit head-on by another
driver who ran a red light. A friend riding with Flowe also had only
scrapes and bruises.</TE>
<TE>   Flowe, who has rushed for 568 yards in seven games, was expected
to return to full speed this week after an ankle injury suffered
against Glendora two weeks ago had limited his playing time against
La Verne Damien.</TE>
<TE>   Chino Coach John Monger said he planned to hold Flowe out of this
week's nonleague game against Lompoc.</TE>
<TE>   Flowe said he has a doctor's appointment on Nov. 11 to assess his
recovery and determine if surgery is necessary.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Two players appear to have made quick recoveries from concussions.</TE>
<TE>   Glendora quarterback Jacob Crook attended a film session Friday
after hitting his head on concrete during Glendora's 21-14 loss to
Diamond Bar the night before.</TE>
<TE>   Crook was taken to the hospital after he suffered a glancing blow
when he went down out of bounds. Glendora Coach Paul Lopez said Crook
was released before the game was over after a CT scan was negative.
Lopez is unsure whether he will allow Crook to play Friday against
Damien.</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Hills running back Lorenzo Jackson is expected to return to
action this week after taking a hit to the head in the first half of
the Hawks' 28-26 loss to Newport Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Bruce Ingalls said Jackson suffered the injury when he was
grazed on the side of his head during a tackle. Jackson stayed in the
game for four or five plays before being removed when coaches noticed
he wasn't hitting holes correctly. Disoriented when he came to the
sideline, Jackson was held out the remainder of the game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes became the winningest football
coach in Orange County history with 213 victories after the Griffins
defeated Fountain Valley, 39-6. The 53-year-old registered all of his
victories at Los Alamitos except for two he earned in his only season
at Anaheim Magnolia, in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   Dick Hill, who amassed 212 victories at Santa Ana Valley, Santa
Ana and Orange, is an assistant at Fullerton this season. Garden
Grove Pacifica Coach Bill Craven, who posted victory No. 200 when the
Mariners topped Garden Grove Bolsa Grande, 44-6, could catch Hill
next season.</TE>

<LD>2 Minutes it took Irvine Northwood quarterback Kyle Harper to throw
three touchdown passes in the first quarter of the Timberwolves'
40-13 Pacific Coast League victory over Laguna Beach. Harper's
touchdowns went to Mark Kazyak for 11 yards, Brendan Egan for 26
yards and Bobby Borrman for 30 yards. Egan intercepted passes before

<KH>N.Y.GIANTS 24, JACKSONVILLE 17</KH>
<HD>Fassel Makes Right Call</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Jim Fassel spoke, and the New York Giants responded.</LD>
<LD>   Running plays called by Fassel instead of offensive coordinator
Sean Payton, Tiki Barber ran for 101 yards and scored on runs of two
and 44 yards as the Giants broke out of a scoring slump and beat
Jacksonville, 24-17, Sunday night, handing the Jaguars their fourth
straight loss.</LD>
<LD>   "We made it easy for Fassel," Barber said after the Giants (4-4)
ended a two-game losing streak. "We didn't make any mistakes."</LD>
<TE>   Barber is the first Giants' running back to rush for 100 yards
this season.</TE>
<TE>   Kerry Collins added an eight-yard touchdown pass to Ron Dixon in a
game in which the Giants had 394 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of times I'll put the pressure on myself," Fassel said. "I
have done that before here and it stirred people up, and I'll take
the pressure. I know people have second-guessed me. I don't care. I
make decisions based on what gives us the best opportunity to win. If
it means I put my own head in the noose, so be it."</TE>
<TE>   Fassel felt he had to do something after seeing his team score
seven touchdowns in seven games and only 13 points in the last two,
so he decided to call the offensive plays for the first time since
1999.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just what we needed, to get back into a rhythm," said
Collins, who completed 20 of 28 passes for 228 yards. "We found a
good tempo and it allowed us to move the ball real well."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Seder kicked a 24-yard field goal and Mark Brunell threw
fourth-quarter touchdown passes of 14 yards to Bobby Shaw and nine to
Jimmy Smith for Jacksonville (3-5).</TE>
<TE>   However, the Jaguars played a mistake-filled game that started
with an early fumble by Brunell and continued with three key dropped
passes.</TE>
<TE>   "They played faster," Jaguar safety Marlon McCree said. "We were
too anxious. We didn't get settled down.</TE>
<TE>   "We did a few good things, but they controlled us. They kicked our
butts basically. We made them look like some superstars. They did a
good job on offense. Fassel running the plays helped them out."</TE>

<KH>N.Y. JETS 44, SAN DIEGO 13</KH>
<HD>It's a Clear Runaway</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>OK, so maybe the New York Jets aren't that bad, after all. And maybe
the San Diego Chargers aren't quite that good.</LD>
<LD>   At any rate, the reeling Jets got better in a hurry with a 44-13
rout Sunday of the AFC-leading Chargers, who came dressed in their
powder-blue throwback jerseys and left looking like powder puffs.</LD>
<LD>   The stunning victory came a week after the Jets (3-5) blew an
18-point lead in a 24-21 loss to Cleveland, prompting defensive end
John Abraham to harshly criticize the conservative play-calling.</LD>
<TE>   "Just getting a win was good for us, just to put a lot of
negatives behind us," Abraham said. "We're trying to build a season
now. A lot of people put us in the dirt right now. We know we're a
better team than we've shown."</TE>
<TE>   Chad Pennington, Curtis Martin and Santana Moss scored first-half
touchdowns and the Jets went on to post their highest point total
since a 48-21 win over Carolina on Nov. 29, 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers (6-2) came in tied with Green Bay for the NFL's best
record but were never in this game, despite coming off an open date
that allowed players like Junior Seau and Marcellus Wiley to get
healthy.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't come out here ready to play," said LaDainian Tomlinson,
who was held to 60 yards in 12 carries. "We took these guys for
granted."</TE>
<TE>   Said Coach Marty Schottenheimer: "I didn't get the message across,
but I made it very clear throughout the week that this was a very
formidable football team."</TE>
<TE>   It was San Diego's worst defeat since losing 42-10 at Kansas City
on Sept. 17, 2000 -- the season in which the Chargers went 1-15.</TE>

<HD>No Penalty Frustrates Allison</HD>
<DH>King center irate that NHL is not punishing Sutton for
'dangerous play' that resulted in torn knee ligament.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Incensed by the knee-on-knee hit that resulted in an injury expected
to sideline him for at least the next two months, Jason Allison
expressed outrage Sunday that the player who delivered the blow went
unpunished by the NHL.</LD>
<LD>   The King scoring leader suffered a torn medial collateral ligament
and sprained anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee Tuesday
night when he collided with onrushing defenseman Andy Sutton of the
Atlanta Thrashers, who appeared to stick his right leg out as Allison
attempted to maneuver around him.</LD>
<LD>   Though he does not believe that Sutton intended to injure him,
Allison characterized the defender's actions as "dangerous" and
"reckless."</LD>
<TE>   When Sutton was not suspended, Allison couldn't believe it.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very surprised," he said from his Manhattan Beach home,
where he has begun minor rehabilitation since returning home
Wednesday. "I thought that was one of the things we were trying to
crack down on in the league.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, what kind of message is that sending to the rest of the
league when they don't suspend a guy for a hit like that, whether
it's an accident or not? That's saying, 'Hey, you can step up and
have your knees out and clip a guy.'</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, that's what happened."</TE>
<TE>   Watching replays of the hit has only served to further irk
Allison. "I was very angry, definitely, especially knowing that I
can't be part of my team for that long," he said. "I don't think
there's room in our game for plays like that. I know he didn't get
suspended for it, but it was definitely a dangerous play. It's
something that should be looked at by the league, hits like those."</TE>
<TE>   Allison, 27, was carrying the puck up the right side in open ice
at Philips Arena when he and Sutton violently collided near the red
line.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I was by him," Allison said. "He kind of spread his
legs out. He maybe realized he was going to get beat inside. Again, I
don't think he intentionally tried to take my knee out; it was just
one of those plays.</TE>
<TE>   "But we were on the power play and they had two men caught deep
and if I get by him, it's a three-on-one [breakaway for the Kings].
He tried to step up and realized he was probably beat. I think he was
trying for a big hit and I kind of saw him early enough to get out of
the way....</TE>
<TE>   "But if he has his knee out, there's nowhere I can go [to avoid
it].... Stuff happens in a game, but I just think it was kind of a
reckless play by him."</TE>
<TE>   Back in the trainer's room, Allison said he feared the worst: that
his season had ended in the first period of an October win over the
Thrashers.</TE>
<TE>   "From what the doctor was saying, I figured that was the probable
scenario," he said. "I knew it wasn't for sure, but I figured that
was it....</TE>
<TE>   "I was very, very upset and disappointed. Upset at the hit and
disappointed about not being able to stay in the lineup."</TE>
<TE>   An MRI exam taken Wednesday in Culver City, however, revealed that
Allison had not suffered a torn ACL, as was initially feared, and
would not need surgery. Through rest and rehabilitation, the injury
will heal itself. Still, he'll probably be on crutches for another
week. He could be sidelined for half the season. "I'll still be out
for a long time," Allison said he told himself, "but I've got to take
the positive. I'll be back."</TE>
<TE>   As for when, he's not sure. Best guess: Two to three months.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's a target date," he said, "but I've always
been the kind of guy that will push it to get back as soon as I can.
I don't want to miss any more games than I have to.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a pretty vague injury [as to] when you get back. It's not
going to be healed for 12 weeks, but you can usually play a little
earlier than that with a brace."</TE>

<HD>Little Caution About Rule Change</HD>
<DH>CART's red-flag rule revision allows race to end on green
instead of yellow, as it did last year at California Speedway.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Kupper</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>FONTANA</DL>
<LD>A year ago, a long but highly competitive race was coming down to a
two-car shootout at California Speedway when a late-race accident
brought out the yellow caution flag.</LD>
<LD>   With darkness fast approaching, fans who had been hoping to see if
Max Papis could catch Cristiano da Matta never got a chance to find
out. A race that had provided a record 73 lead changes fell one short
-- or at least one attempt short -- and ended anticlimactically, Da
Matta taking the checkered flag as the yellow flew beside it.</LD>
<LD>   Sunday at the same California Speedway, a long, only slightly less
competitive race was coming down to a two-car shootout when a late
race mishap brought out the yellow flag.</LD>
<TE>   Deja vu? Instant replay a year later? Would a race that had
produced 42 lead changes fall one attempt short? Would the yellow
flag prevent Jimmy Vasser, who had led 146 of what was going to be a
250-lap race, from taking a final shot at new leader Michael
Andretti?</TE>
<TE>   No, to the ultimate delight of Vasser, the chagrin of Andretti.</TE>
<TE>   No, thanks to a rule change in CART this season -- inspired in
part by what happened here last year -- that allows for an
interruption in the action if there's a legitimate chance for a
racing finish.</TE>
<TE>   So on Lap 246, when Dario Franchitti's car blew an engine and
pulled onto the apron of the track in Turn 4, spewing smoke and
flame, naturally the yellow flag flew. Then minutes later, the red
flag flew, the one that stops a race.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, that wasn't a possibility here. The start of the race
had been delayed by rain and the distance reduced from 500 to 440
miles, just to get it in before darkness fell. There would have been
no time to clean the track and restart the race. As it was, evening
had set in when the race ended.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday was a beautiful day, there was no threat of early darkness,
so the red-flag rule was invoked.</TE>
<TE>   And about 10 minutes later, after the fire had been put out,
Franchitti's car moved out of the way and the track cleaned, they
went racing again, a 500-mile race reduced to a four-mile trophy
dash.</TE>
<TE>   Andretti, thanks to a slingshot pass of Vasser coming off a yellow
flag only a few laps earlier, was out in front on the restart, just
where he didn't want to be.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I was a sitting duck at the end," he said. "Had the red
flag not come out, I think I would have won because Jimmy couldn't
catch me."</TE>
<TE>   But a restart? On the big, high-speed tracks where aerodynamics
play such an important role, catching is what restarts are all about.</TE>
<TE>   And after two warmup laps, when the green fell, Vasser put the
same kind of move on Andretti that Andretti had put on Vasser,
running in Andretti's slipstream, then breaking out of it at the
start-finish line, shooting past Andretti and holding him off for the
last two laps.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to catch him, but I couldn't," Andretti said. "I told the
guys [on the two-way radio] that I wasn't going to get him."</TE>
<TE>   It was the second time this season that CART had invoked the
red-flag rule, having used it at Vancouver, Canada, in July. There,
it didn't affect the outcome, because Da Matta held off Paul Tracy
for six laps after the restart.</TE>
<TE>   Here, though, Vasser was grateful for the late opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen NASCAR [use the red flag] this year and I think it's
better for the fans to have a green-flag finish," he said. "I was a
little upset about the late yellow [only a few laps earlier] because
we were in the lead. But then the red flag helped us later.... If the
thing with Dario hadn't happened, it was going to be very difficult
for me to get around Mike. I'm glad I was behind Mike this time."</TE>
<TE>   Andretti is leaving CART after this season to run a team in the
rival Indy Racing League. Last week, he'd suggested that CART had
played politics and manipulated the finish of a rainy-day race in
Australia so that it wouldn't end while he was leading.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, he had no complaints.</TE>
<TE>   "I sure didn't want to see the red flag because I knew I was a
sitting duck, but it's the new rule this season. So, yeah, it was the
proper thing. A rule is a rule."</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Rahal, the former driver who owns Vasser's car, was a bit
more emphatic than Vasser or Andretti.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad they stopped it," he said. "I thought it was pretty bush
league for Dario to be riding around with an engine that was
obviously going to blow."</TE>

<LD>Shaquille O'Neal continues to press toward a Nov. 12 return from the
surgery that relieved him of the pain of arthritis and bone spurs,
saying Sunday he's beginning to believe that his recovery could be
complete by then.</LD>
<LD>   "I hope," he said. "I hope."</LD>
<LD>   Going on eight weeks since the surgery, O'Neal said the part of
his toe that had the arthritic condition feels healed, and he's only
waiting on the underside of the toe, where Dr. Robert Mohr shaved
bone spurs. O'Neal is off the medication, and when he is wearing his
new shoes and orthotics, he said, he feels no pain.</LD>
<TE>   He said if he'd had to play Sunday -- "The playoffs?" he asked --
he could have, and that he's feeling no ill effects from his gradual
work increase.</TE>

<TE>   Doug Christie, in the Sacramento Bee, on whether his wife really
massaged O'Neal's big toe: "There are always going to be other

should have been suspended. That's crazy. ... We should play tag team

<HD>A Kobe Show Stopper</HD>
<DH>Bryant burns Portland and nemesis Patterson for
triple-double with 33 points in 98-95 Laker overtime win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kobe Bryant had another triple-double Sunday night, one of those
drag-everybody-along-for-stretches games that this time beat the
Portland Trail Blazers.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers played into overtime and won, 98-95, before a sleepy
crowd at Staples Center that finally fawned over Bryant, and Brian
Shaw, and Devean George, and a rather game Laker team that is 2-2
without Shaquille O'Neal and Rick Fox.</LD>
<LD>   By the end of overtime, between the confetti strands, the healthy
Lakers half hugged each other, half held each other up, and grinned
at this victory, their second in a row since being blown out in
Portland four nights before.</LD>
<TE>   Bryant had 33 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assists, one rebound
short of his numbers Friday night against the Clippers. He played 50
minutes, the last 10 or so in relentless pursuit of Portland's Derek
Anderson, who scored 24 points, four in the fourth quarter and eight
in the five-minute overtime period.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw, who played 21 minutes off the bench, scored 11 points after
halftime, including a three-pointer that gave the Lakers a 92-85 lead
in overtime. George scored a career-high 25 points on a career-high
18 shots. He made two free throws with 16.7 seconds left in overtime,
forcing the Trail Blazers to attempt a three, which Scottie Pippen
missed.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Derek Fisher grabbed Bryant and said, "Man, don't Oscar
Robertson them like that two nights in a row! Don't Big O 'em!"</TE>
<TE>   Fisher shook his head and laughed. "He's making it look so easy."</TE>
<TE>   George played 47 minutes, as did Robert Horry. Fisher played 44.
So, Phil Jackson had found something critical about an early-November
game, and afterward the Lakers, who leave today for a three-game East
Coast trip, spoke with a certain heavy-lidded satisfaction.</TE>
<TE>   "Like I said from the beginning of the season, my whole focus is
to make my teammates better," Bryant said. "You know, offense is
going to come whether I score 30 points or 14. It really doesn't
matter. It's really about getting my teammates involved, making them
better players all season."</TE>
<TE>   He found satisfaction, then, in the game played by George, who
missed shots early but made them late, as the Lakers worked back from
a seven-point deficit with 3:20 left in regulation. And in Shaw, who
has not played big minutes while Jackson experiments with new guards
such as Kareem Rush, Jannero Pargo and Tracy Murray, but made the
jump shot that tied the score, 81-81.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant scored 15 points in the fourth quarter, two from the
free-throw line with 4.5 seconds left that gave the Lakers an 85-83
lead.</TE>
<TE>   "Very impressive," Shaw said.</TE>
<TE>   Then Anderson made a 22-foot jumper at the regulation buzzer,
forging the 85-85 tie, and gleefully picked at his black-and-red
jersey. But, then it was gone, when the Lakers scored the first seven
points in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   "They were a little more hungry for it, I think," Pippen said.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of regulation, Bryant had his triple-double -- 31
points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists, his second in two games, in three
nights. It had been more than 11 years since a Laker followed a
triple-double with another, since Magic Johnson in late March 1991,
against Sacramento and Portland.</TE>
<TE>   "Phew," Bryant said. "That's great company to be mentioned with
the Magic man. I don't even know what to say to that."</TE>
<TE>   It was a tremendous effort, of course, with O'Neal at the end of
the bench and the edge of the huddle and the Trail Blazers cheating
away from everyone but Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   By the end, Laker possessions often came down to Bryant versus
Ruben Patterson -- self-proclaimed "Kobe stopper" -- at the top,
Bryant scanning for cutters, then clearing Patterson's fingertips by
inches with a jumper, or a pass. Then, they'd talk.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just telling him, 'You're making incredible shots on me,' "
Patterson said. "Because I played great defense and, I mean, he's
really improved on his jump shot.... I give him credit."</TE>
<TE>   Playing for the fourth time since Wednesday, the Trail Blazers had
won one of their first three, that one a blowout of the Lakers. Since
then, they'd lost by 28 points to the Sacramento Kings and by 17 to
the, uh, Denver Nuggets. They'd also lost Arvydas Sabonis to a
hamstring injury, so this was not a team gaining on its
underachieving recent history.</TE>
<TE>   "That's sad, to say that we split them," Pippen said. "They were
Shaq-less and Fox-less but ... we have to learn to play better."</TE>

<HD>First Place Queen Finishes as Such</HD>

<LD>First Place Queen lived up to her name and made the best of a
wide-open field Sunday night by nipping Sum Special Strawfly in a
photo finish to win the $733,950 Golden State Futurity at Los
Alamitos Race Course.</LD>
<LD>   With jockey G.R. Carter aboard, the victory was worth $289,764 for
the 2-year old filly, who took advantage of a late scratch by early
favorite Meteoric, who was suffering from a high fever.</LD>
<LD>   Deefirst, who went off at 5-2, finished third in the 400-yard
race, holding off Twotimesthefly, who was making a late charge, at
the wire.</LD>
<TE>   Ironically, First Place Queen has been battling illness most of
the fall and was making her second start since finishing out of the
money Sept. 2 at the All-American Futurity at Ruidoso Downs, N.M.</TE>
<TE>   "She made it to this race on guts alone," trainer John H. Bassett
said. "But this was a race where she got to show her talent."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after leaving the gate, Sum Special Strawfly held a slight
lead over First Place Queen. But First Place Queen got it back in the
final 100 yards and won by a nose in a time of 19.89 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Meteoric had won six of seven starts, the loss coming Sept. 2 at
the All-American Futurity when the brown gelding finished third.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday trainer Lin Melton had Meteoric treated for a
104-degree fever, and the horse did not respond well.</TE>

<HD>Finally, Benson Ends His Long Winston Cup Winless Streak</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Johnny Benson ended one of the longest winless streaks in NASCAR on
Sunday, holding off Mark Martin to win the Winston Cup Series Pop
Secret 400 at Rockingham, N.C., for his first victory in 226 starts.</LD>
<LD>   Benson, known as the best driver to never win a Winston Cup race,
led the final 28 laps but had to battle Martin over the final dozen
laps at North Carolina Speedway.</LD>
<LD>   Martin, in the thick of the Winston Cup championship chase, was
racing for the win and several times drove his Ford onto the bumper
of Benson's Pontiac.</LD>
<TE>   When he couldn't bump Benson out of the way, he tried to pass him
in the lower grooves of the race track.</TE>
<TE>   None of it worked and the 39-year-old Benson beat him to the
finish line by .261 seconds to become the fifth first-time winner
this season.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a long time coming, Johnny Benson, but you got your win,"
crew chief James Ince radioed him as he crossed the finish line.</TE>
<TE>   Benson then started a long slide across the infield grass before
turning the traditional celebratory doughnuts, so many that his car
ran out of gas and had to be pushed into victory lane.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought for a couple of years that I'd never get a win," Benson
said. "I was always going to be the best guy who never won a race."</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Busch, who came into the event on a two-race winning streak,
led 105 laps but faded and finished third. Jeff Burton was fourth,
giving Roush Racing three Fords in the top four.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Gordon finished fifth in a Chevrolet, Mike Skinner was sixth
and was followed by Bobby Labonte and Matt Kenseth, the fourth Roush
entry. Ricky Craven and Jeff Green rounded out the top 10.</TE>
<TE>   Martin's strong finish, coupled with struggles for points leader
Tony Stewart, tightened the title chase considerably.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart was angry when he exited his Pontiac, stopping only to say
the car was the worst he had driven.</TE>
<TE>   He came into the event with a 146-point lead over Martin, but had
handling problems early in the race and his car fell a lap down
early. He fought with the car the entire race and finished 14th,
reducing his lead to 87 points.</TE>
<TE>   Jimmie Johnson, who was 150 points behind, had mechanical problems
and finished 37th. He's now 219 points behind Stewart, probably too
great a margin to overcome with only two races left in the season.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Newman, the rookie who started from the pole, led two times
for 41 laps but finished 23rd.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bud Kaeding won the $100,000 Budweiser Oval Nationals sprint car
race late Saturday night on the half-mile clay oval at Perris Auto
Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   Kaeding, the Northern California sprint car champion from
Campbell, is the first back-to-back winner in the event's seven-year
run. He earned $30,000 for winning the 100-lap race.</TE>

<HD>Reserves Help Heat Hand Kings First Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With his team winless and in danger of blowing a lead for the third
game in a row, Coach Pat Riley turned to the bench and found help.</LD>
<LD>   Reserves Mike James and Vladimir Stepania sparked a 12-0 run in
the fourth quarter at Miami that helped the Heat give the shorthanded
Sacramento Kings their first loss Sunday, 88-78.</LD>
<LD>   The victory allowed Riley to avoid the first 0-3 start of his
career.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a great effort," he said. "A lot of NBA teams don't bring
it every night. They bring their talent, and maybe they get by with
it, but we can't. We have to bring an incredible effort every night."</TE>
<TE>   Keon Clark scored 19 points for Sacramento (3-1), which was again
without three regulars and shot 36%. Starters Bobby Jackson and
Predrag Stojakovic were a combined six of 30, and the Kings made only
two of 14 three-point attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson gave the Heat's defense a backhanded compliment.</TE>
<TE>   "They got away with a lot of grabbing and holding," he said. "We
like to do a lot of backdoor cuts, but that wasn't there tonight
because they kept grabbing us."</TE>
<TE>   Miami was called for 23 fouls to 16 on Sacramento, but Clark also
complained about the officiating.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, there are people on the floor who also control the
game, and they aren't in uniform," Clark said. "I guess all we can do
is control what we can, and we didn't do that tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 91, Utah 77 -- It didn't help the Jazz that Karl Malone
got into early foul trouble at Seattle and went scoreless on 0-for-7
shooting, the first time he has been shut out in his 18 NBA seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Malone's previous career low was two points on Dec. 18, 1985, his
rookie season, at New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Payton, on the other hand, made nine of 12 shots and scored
18 points to help the SuperSonics improve to 3-0.</TE>
<TE>   Desmond Mason had 16 points, Vladimir Radmanovic scored 15 and
Peja Drobnjak 10 for Seattle. Kenny Anderson, in his first action for
the SuperSonics this season after fighting back spasms, scored 10.</TE>

<HD>Vince Carter Is Day-to-Day</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Toronto Raptor star Vince Carter was listed as day-to-day after an
MRI on Sunday showed no structural damage to the surgically repaired
left knee he reinjured the night before.</LD>
<LD>   Carter strained his left quadriceps tendon Saturday, collapsing
with 6:17 to go in the first quarter of an 88-76 loss to the Houston
Rockets. He was helped to the locker room.</LD>
<LD>   Carter's "jumper's knee" is an overuse injury, and cost him 22
games at the end of last season. He played his final game March 19,
then underwent surgery the following week.</LD>
<TE>   The Raptors rallied in Carter's absence last season, winning 12 of
14 down the stretch to reach the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The 25-year-old Carter played through the exhibition season and
Toronto's first two games saying he felt no pain.</TE>
<TE>   He seemed to be back to his acrobatic self, throwing down a huge
one-handed dunk Friday night in a loss at San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   The three-time all-star was the team's leading scorer in the first
two games, averaging 18 points and three rebounds in 36 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Houston's Rudy Tomjanovich coached Carter on the U.S. Olympic
team.</TE>
<TE>   "My heart goes out to Vince Carter, I hope his injury is not
serious," Tomjanovich said.</TE>
<TE>   The Raptors also lost forward Antonio Davis on Saturday night
because of a strained muscle in his left ribcage. He is expected to
be sidelined one or two weeks.</TE>

<HD>Singh Finally Wins It</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vijay Singh atoned for two final-round failures at East Lake Golf
Course in Atlanta, pulling away from the field with three consecutive
birdies and closing with a three-under-par 67 Sunday to win the
season-ending PGA Tour Championship.</LD>
<LD>   A 54-hole leader the previous two times at East Lake, Singh
finally figured out how to close the deal. He missed only two greens,
and finished at 12-under 268 to win $900,000.</LD>
<LD>   Jerry Kelly made an ace on No. 11 to reduce Singh's lead to one
and Charles Howell III holed a wedge from the 13th fairway for an
eagle and birdied the 17th hole, but Singh held off the challenges.</LD>
<TE>   Howell closed with a 66 and was the only player among the top 30
on the money list to break par all four rounds at East Lake.</TE>
<TE>   David Toms had a 67 to finish third. The former PGA champion
failed to win a tournament this year for the first time since 1998,
although he still finished fourth on the money list.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods was never a factor after taking a double bogey on the
opening hole. He hit only four fairways and finished with a 70 and
tied for seventh, the first time he has finished out of the top five
since the British Open.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Grace Park won the World Ladies Match Play Championship at Narita,
Japan, beating Japan's Midori Yoneyama with a 12-foot birdie putt on
the 22nd hole.</TE>
<TE>   Yoneyama, ranked 15th among the 16 Japan LPGA players who began
play in the 32-woman field, missed a chance to end the match on the
20th hole when her two-foot par putt slid by the hole.</TE>
<TE>   Yoneyama also had a chance to win on the 18th hole, but her long
birdie putt stopped an inch short -- sending the players to extra
holes.</TE>
<TE>   Park lost the third and fifth holes with bogeys, but closed the
gap to one with a six-foot birdie putt on No. 9 and tied it on No. 13
when Yoneyama missed a five-footer for par.</TE>
<TE>   Park, the 1998 U.S. amateur champion as a freshman at Arizona
State, also beat Japan's Mikino Kubo, Australia's Karrie Webb and
Japan's Yuri Fudoh en route to her third LPGA Tour title in three
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The final round of the PGA Southern Farm Bureau Classic at
Madison, Miss., was postponed until today because of rain and wind
with England's Luke Donald leading Deane Pappas by one stroke.</TE>
<TE>   Fifty-four players were on the course when play was stopped after
about an hour. Tournament officials waited about four hours before
calling it a day.</TE>

<TE>   Slovakia defeated Spain for its first Fed Cup title, with injured
Spanish star Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario reduced to tears on the court by
a heckler.</TE>
<TE>   Daniela Hantuchova and Janette Husarova won both reverse singles
matches at Maspalomas, Canary Islands, to take an unbeatable 3-1 lead
in the best-of-five competition, the women's version of the Davis
Cup. Spain was going for its sixth Fed Cup title.</TE>
<TE>   Hantuchova beat Conchita Martinez, 6-7 (8), 7-5, 6-4, and Husarova
beat Sanchez-Vicario, 6-0, 6-2. The doubles match was canceled.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez-Vicario played her record 100th Fed Cup match, but was
barely able to run after straining her right thigh during Thursday's
semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   As the second set began, a Spanish spectator screamed that she
should give way to Magui Serna. The crowd then screamed at the man,
telling him to leave.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez-Vicario began to cry. She drew a standing ovation and the
crowd started chanting her name. Play was delayed for 10 minutes. The
spectators in the row with the heckler left him sitting there alone.</TE>
<TE>   Marat Safin won his first title of the year, easily beating
Lleyton Hewitt, 7-6 (4), 6-0, 6-4, to win the Paris Masters for the
second time.</TE>
<TE>   Safin closed the straight-set victory against the world's No. 1
player with a service winner. Hewitt seemed to show little effort
during the second set, in which he failed to win a game.</TE>
<TE>   Both players will take part in the season-ending Masters Cup in
Shanghai, China, later this month.</TE>
<TE>   At the eight-man event, Hewitt will try to extend his lead in the
ATP Champions Race. He leads Andre Agassi by 88 points.</TE>
<TE>   After he and Gustavo Kuerten lost, 6-3, 7-6 (6), to Nicolas Escude
and Fabrice Santoro in the doubles final, Cedric Pioline, 33,
announced that he is retiring, ending his 13-year career.</TE>

<TE>   Joyce Chepchumba of Kenya pulled away from her last challenger to
win the New York City Marathon for her first victory in two years.</TE>
<TE>   She finished in 2 hours 25 minutes 56 seconds in temperatures in
the 40s and no wind. Los Angeles Marathon champion Lyubov Denisova of
Russia was next, 21 seconds behind. Olivera Jevtic of Yugoslavia was
third, despite falling.</TE>
<TE>   Marla Runyan, the first legally blind Olympian and attempting a
marathon for the first time, was the top U.S. finisher. She was fifth
overall, just ahead of defending champion Margaret Okayo.</TE>
<TE>   Rodgers Rop of Kenya won the men's title in 2:08:07. Countrymen
Christopher Cheboiboch (2:08:17) and Laban Kipkemboi (2:08:39)
followed.</TE>

<HD>St. Louis Extends Winning Streak to Eight Games</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While the St. Louis Blues keep finding ways to win, the New York
Rangers are letting games slip away night after night.</LD>
<LD>   Scott Mellanby scored a goal and added an assist, and Doug Weight
had two assists Sunday to lead the Blues to a 3-2 victory over the
Rangers at Madison Square Garden.</LD>
<LD>   Weight has 14 points in the last seven games for the Blues, who
got 23 saves from Fred Brathwaite. St. Louis extended its winning
streak to eight games and is unbeaten in nine. New York is 2-6 in its
last eight games.</LD>
<TE>   The Rangers have been hurt following penalties taken by Eric
Lindros. Lindros was in the box for high-sticking when Mellanby
scored the winner.</TE>
<TE>   Mellanby intercepted a clearing attempt at the left circle and
beat Mike Richter at 6:03 of the third period for his third goal of
the season.</TE>
<TE>   Columbus 3, Buffalo 2 -- Derrick Walser's first goal of the season
capped a rare third-period comeback as the Blue Jackets improved to
.500.</TE>
<TE>   It was only the second time the Blue Jackets have won a game after
trailing through two periods. They were 1-75-4-2 when behind after
two periods.</TE>
<TE>   The only previous comeback win was a 2-1 victory over the Mighty
Ducks on Jan. 27, 2001, after trailing, 1-0, going into the third
period.</TE>
<TE>   The victory at Columbus improved the Blue Jackets to 5-5-1-0 --
the latest into a season they have been at .500 in the franchise's
three years.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 2, Nashville 1 -- Daniel Briere blasted a power-play goal
past Tomas Vokoun with 40 seconds left in overtime as the Coyotes
earned their first home win of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Vokoun had 43 saves, but couldn't deny the Coyotes on their eighth
power play after Andy Delmore drew a hooking penalty for wrestling
Ladislav Nagy to the ice 3:32 into overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonton 4, Chicago 1 -- Anson Carter scored twice and Tommy Salo
stopped 24 shots for the Oilers at Chicago. Ryan Smyth and Shawn
Horcoff also scored for the Oilers, who have earned points in four
straight games (2-0-1-1).</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 3, Dallas 3 -- Jason Williams' power-play goal with 6:19
left in regulation gave the Red Wings the tie at Detroit. Williams
tipped in a pass from the bottom of the left circle while Dallas
forward Brenden Morrow was off for hooking.</TE>

<KH>SAN FRANCISCO 23, OAKLAND 20 (OT)</KH>
<HD>After Wide Left, Cortez Gets It Right for 49ers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>The short kick went wide left, and Jose Cortez knelt in agony as
Raider Nation joyously screamed for overtime.</LD>
<LD>   But just when things were at their silver-and-blackest for San
Francisco in the Battle of the Bay, Jeff Garcia smiled. Terrell Owens
shouted encouragement to the crushed kicker, and with one more drive
that recalled the best days of the franchise, the 49ers beat the
Oakland Raiders, 23-20, on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Atoning for his 27-yard miss on the final play of regulation,
Cortez made a 23-yard field goal 8:41 into overtime that capped more
than 15 consecutive minutes of ball control by the 49ers.</LD>
<TE>   "It was gritty, it was courageous, it was off the charts," San
Francisco Coach Steve Mariucci said. "This team was not intimidated
by this crowd, nor by the distractions."</TE>
<TE>   The 49ers (6-2) ran the game's final 30 plays -- and that was
after a 15-play, 88-yard drive that lasted almost nine minutes
spanning the third and fourth quarters. San Francisco's dynamic duo
largely was responsible, with Garcia passing and scrambling
spectacularly and Owens carving up the Raiders' weary defense.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia was 25 for 36 for 282 yards, completing 17 of his 19 passes
after halftime and rushing for 46 yards to keep the 49ers moving
downfield. Owens caught 12 passes for 191 yards in his best game of
the season.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very emotional in the locker room after the game, but that
was relief more than excitement," Garcia said. "Being a Bay area guy
and following both these teams my whole life, it has to be my most
satisfying win."</TE>
<TE>   It was a grim day for Jerry Rice, who was playing against his
former team in the regular season for the first time. Rice set every
significant NFL receiving record during his 16 seasons with the
49ers, and Sunday he had six catches for 74 yards. But when the game
was on the line, he was stranded on the sideline as San Francisco's
next generation of stars dominated.</TE>
<TE>   "We were parked on the sideline," Rice said. "It's very
frustrating."</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders (4-4) have lost four in a row. On the 49ers' final
three possessions, Oakland allowed them to convert eight third downs
and a fourth and one at the Raider 45 in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   The Coliseum crowd rained taunts and insults on the 49ers' bench
all afternoon. Cortez sent the fans into delirium when he shanked his
27-yard attempt on the last play of regulation -- after San Francisco
controlled the ball 6 1/2 minutes</TE>
<TE>   But the 49ers won the coin toss and simply never stopped moving,
with Garcia completing 11 consecutive passes.</TE>
<TE>   Given a second chance, Cortez sent his kick down the middle.</TE>

<HD>Patriots Look Like Champions Again</HD>
<DH>Unorthodox defense makes things hard for former teammate
Bledsoe and New England routs Buffalo, 38-7.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ORCHARD PARK, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>So much for the great debate.</LD>
<LD>   The New England Patriots should have kept Drew Bledsoe over Tom
Brady? Yeah, right. They were fools for trading Bledsoe to division
rival Buffalo? Whatever. They're Super Bowl poseurs circling the
drain? Save your breath.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't really care what the rest of the country thinks of us,"
Patriot receiver Troy Brown said after a 38-7 trouncing of the Bills
Sunday. "If anyone wants to jump off the ship, jump off."</LD>
<TE>   To this point, the Patriots had been walking the plank. They
followed a 3-0 start by losing four in a row, and a loss Sunday could
have destroyed them. Maybe that's why the overriding feeling in the
locker room was not gloating but relief. Finally, they can exhale,
especially because only two of their final eight opponents have
winning records.</TE>
<TE>   For the Patriots (4-4) it was a two-game swing. Had they lost to
Buffalo (5-4), they would have been in third place in the AFC East by
at least two games -- first-place Miami (5-2) plays at Green Bay
tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "You have two options," Brady said. "You can stay there and let
the team stomp on you, or you can try and fight your way out of it.
Today, we fought our way out of it."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, they thought their way out of it. Pure and simple, they
outsmarted the Bills with a novel defensive strategy, and, on
offense, with more screens than a five-level Cineplex.</TE>
<TE>   Time after time, Bledsoe took the snap and immediately zinged a
pass behind the line of scrimmage to a receiver or running back, then
let that player make a move and tear upfield. High-percentage passes,
and lots of them. The Patriots built a 14-0 lead early in the second
quarter on a 10-for-10 passing performance by Brady, and nine of
those completions were either screens or dump-offs.</TE>
<TE>   Three of Brady's four touchdown passes came on screens to running
backs -- two to Antowain Smith, one to Kevin Faulk. The other
touchdown, which came on the opening drive, was a five-yard play to
tight end Christian Fauria</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't really feature their receivers in the first half at
all," Buffalo safety Pierson Prioleau said. "Nobody says they have to
throw to the receivers. You throw the ball where you can, to the open
man."</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe spent all afternoon trying to find the open man, but he
only had a moment before he was surrounded by Patriot defenders. He
was sacked four times and hurried many more. And the Patriots showed
him no mercy, even though he spent his first eight seasons as the
heart and soul of their offense.</TE>
<TE>   "If it was my brother at quarterback I would have tried to knock
him out," linebacker Tedy Bruschi said. "That's the way I looked at
it."</TE>
<TE>   When he had time, Bledsoe was hitting his targets. He completed
his first seven passes, and it was midway through the second quarter
when his first errant throw hit the turf. But the Bills were unable
to establish an offensive rhythm, and kicker Mike Hollis sprayed his
field-goal attempts everywhere -- short on a 50-yarder, wide right on
a 25-yarder, wide left on a 45-yarder.</TE>
<TE>   Hollis was so unreliable, the Bills chose to punt from the New
England 32 on the opening drive of the second half rather than have
him try a kick from 49 yards. That was the beginning of the end for
Buffalo, which was facing a 17-7 deficit, and never again reached the
end zone.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots found a creative way to put extra pressure on
Bledsoe. They often waited until a nanosecond before the ball was
snapped to fall into formation. At times, they had as few as one
lineman with his hand on the ground and as many as six linebackers.
Often, it appeared chaotic, with players milling about with their
backs to the line of scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a calculated situation," said Romeo Crennel, New England's
defensive coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   "There was some risk, but we felt the reward was worth it."</TE>
<TE>   New England Coach Bill Belichick has a hand in the defense too,
and he has a 6-4 record when scheming against teams quarterbacked by
Bledsoe. It's no secret that Belichick and Bledsoe don't have a warm
relationship. Bledsoe feels Belichick ushered him out. Belichick
speaks respectfully of Bledsoe but felt he had no choice but to let
him go.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, Bledsoe called out to Belichick, jogged over and
shook his hand. There wasn't a drip of bad blood to be found.</TE>
<TE>   "You shake hands and live to fight another day," Bledsoe said. "We
-- all of us on both sides of the ball -- go out there and do
everything we can to win. After the game, if it doesn't work out your
way, you shake hands and congratulate the other guy. That's what you
do."</TE>
<TE>   Belichick, who referred to Bledsoe as "a class act," said the
so-called feud is as much a media creation as anything.</TE>
<TE>   "I know everyone wants to hype the game," he said. "But the
important part for us is we beat Buffalo in Buffalo."</TE>
<TE>   End of debate.</TE>

<LD>The San Diego Chargers were booed at home Sunday, because it was
Throwback Sunday in San Diego -- time to break out the old
powder-blue jerseys and the old white helmets and the old 44-13
losses to the New York Jets.</LD>
<LD>   The Chicago Bears were also booed at home, because their 19-13
loss to Philadelphia was their sixth defeat in a row in 2002, meaning
owner Mike McCaskey didn't get enough of a return on the soul he sold
in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Peyton Manning was booed at home, despite passing for 327 yards
and two touchdowns, because, evidently, he was responsible for
Indianapolis' first-, second- and third-string running backs being
injured and unavailable for the Colts' 23-15 loss to Tennessee.</LD>
<TE>   Matt Hasselbeck was booed at home, because that's what football
fans in Seattle do.</TE>
<TE>   There was so much booing by so many home fans, it sounded like a
Cincinnati Bengal game.</TE>
<TE>   Except there was no booing at Paul Brown Stadium on Sunday because
the Bengals were playing in Houston. Winning in Houston too.</TE>
<TE>   Winning for the first time in eight games this season.</TE>
<TE>   Winning by a score of 38-3, their largest margin of victory since
1989.</TE>
<TE>   Winning, at last, despite being three-point underdogs to an
expansion team, to salvage whatever was left of the reputations of
Bengal Coach Dick LeBeau, who predicted victory over the Texans, and
wide receiver Chad Johnson, who guaranteed it.</TE>
<TE>   Every autumn, two groups of old football players from Florida
settle into their armchairs and begin their hopeful, fateful
countdowns. Members of the 1972 Miami Dolphins, the only NFL team to
complete a season undefeated, count down the days until their record
is safe for another year. Members of the 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers,
who went 0-14 in their inaugural season, count down the days until
every current NFL teams breaks into the victory column.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, the Buccaneers had to sweat it out until Week 14
before the Detroit Lions faltered in their quest.</TE>
<TE>   This season, Cincinnati prolonged the anxiety until Week 9.</TE>
<TE>   If there were champagne corks popping in the homes of creaking
Buccaneers, the Bengals' postgame celebration was distinctly
restrained.</TE>
<TE>   Offensive tackle Willie Anderson scolded Johnson for his brazen
act, telling reporters, "We told Chad, 'No more guarantees.' It puts
too much pressure on the offensive line, because the crowd gets so
into it and you can't hear."</TE>
<TE>   LeBeau turned the historic victory into a stand-up routine,
deadpanning that his prediction was "misconstrued," that he thought
the question was whether he could beat Texan Coach Dom Capers in
golf.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, LeBeau said, he guaranteed he could beat Capers in golf.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, that LeBeau humor.</TE>
<TE>   He'd better keep his day job, which is why LeBeau needed this
victory so desperately. Before Sunday, LeBeau was 0-7 in 2002 after
going 6-10 in 2001 and 4-9 after replacing Bruce Coslet during the
2000 season.</TE>
<TE>   That's a very tired act. LeBeau had to take it out on the road,
try some new material. What's black and white and red all over? The
Houston Texans, who might need to change their color scheme, maybe
burn those uniforms, after losing to Cincinnati at home by 35 points.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers, a startling 6-1 in their boring navy blues, dug out
their classic powder blues for an old-time AFL reunion with the Jets,
led by Broadway Chad Pennington. Ordinarily, those uniforms are a
welcome sight in San Diego. The Chargers ought to wear them every
weekend -- look what happened to the Angels after they reclaimed a
bit of their sartorial past -- but team management stubbornly refuses
to make the switch, breaking out the 1960s suits only for special
occasions, such as 31-point losses to the Jets.</TE>
<TE>   The new-look Chargers in their old-look jerseys looked
suspiciously like Notre Dame in its unlucky green jerseys against
Boston College. The Jets, coming in at 2-5 with a defense yielding
more than 400 yards a game, routed San Diego and limited LaDainian
Tomlinson to 60 yards -- one fewer than LaMont Jordan managed on one
scoring run in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Charger Coach Marty Schottenheimer called his team's performance
"unacceptable." Charger quarterback Drew Brees said "We played
probably the worst we can play." The Qualcomm Stadium crowd didn't
disagree, letting their turnaround heroes hear it, even if at 6-2,
the 2002 Chargers have still won as many games as the 2000 and 2001
Chargers combined.</TE>
<TE>   Which proves that even long-suffering fans get spoiled if they sit
out in the sun too long.</TE>
<TE>   Still, San Diego is a long ways from Oakland, festering home of
the Black Hole deviants, still revved from Halloween with the hated
49ers stopping by.</TE>
<TE>   Conditions in that silver-and-black asylum are so twisted, many
49er players strictly forbade their families from taking the trip
across the bay, ordering them to stay at home for their safety.</TE>
<TE>   Good move, since the 49ers made the crucial mistake of beating the
Raiders in their nest, 23-20, in overtime, on a 23-yard field goal by
Jose Cortez a few minutes after Cortez had been rattled into missing
a 27-yarder.</TE>
<TE>   "It was gritty, it was courageous, it was off the charts," said
49er Coach Steve Mariucci, who sounds like he should be reviewing
movies for "Good Morning America."</TE>
<TE>   It was a surly Sunday all around, all the way to Detroit, where
new NFL career rushing leader Emmitt Smith was booed for his long
years of meritorious service to the game. Smith gained only 39 yards
in 16 carries against the Lions. His Dallas Cowboys scored only a
single touchdown in a 9-7 loss to the Lions.</TE>
<TE>   Lion fans should have been appeased. Instead, they jeered Smith,
serenading him with chants of "Bar-ry! Bar-ry!" in reference to
ex-Lion Barry Sanders, who was on his way to breaking Walter Payton's
record before abruptly retiring in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, I'm in Detroit!" Smith mused afterward. "Anything less would
be uncivilized."</TE>
<TE>   Smith would say that. He has piled up nearly 17,000 yards
traveling across this league. The old Cowboy has been around.</TE>

Sunday, including the clinching 13-yard touchdown with 1:53 to play,
as the defending NFC champions won their third consecutive game after
an 0-5 start, 27-14 over the Arizona Cardinals.</LD>
<TE>   "He was cramping up," Ram quarterback Marc Bulger said. "I saw the
look on his face and I didn't know if he was going to make it, but he
showed something out there today."</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis is 19-0 when Faulk reaches triple digits in rushing. He
had 16 carries in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what I'm here to do," Faulk said. "I'm here to be in there
at crunch time, getting those carries, running out the clock. That's
my job. Sometimes you're not 100%. Sometimes you're not 90. But
you've got to go out there and give it your all."</TE>
<TE>   In the Rams' three-game winning streak, Faulk has gained 571 yards
in 85 attempts and has 16 catches for 132 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Bulger, 3-0 as the starter in the absence of injured Kurt Warner,
completed 20 of 29 passes for 245 yards and two touchdowns, but was
intercepted twice. The second interception resulted a return for an
Arizona touchdown that cut the lead to 17-14 with 10:36 to play.</TE>
<TE>   "You take that play out of there, and he was nothing short of
outstanding," Ram Coach Mike Martz said. "That's a young player's
mistake. If that's his only bad mistake in three games, which it is,
then you've got to be very happy where he is."</TE>

<KH>ATLANTA 20, BALTIMORE 17</KH>
<HD>Falcons Are Quick to Pick Up for Vick</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Michael Vick's performance tailed off considerably from the previous
two weeks, but that didn't keep the Atlanta Falcons from extending
their longest winning streak in five seasons.</LD>
<LD>   Defensive end Patrick Kerney scored on a fumble return and T.J.
Duckett had a touchdown run in a 20-17 victory over the Baltimore
Ravens on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Vick had been spectacular in victories over Carolina and New
Orleans, becoming the first quarterback in NFL history to rush for
more than 90 yards in two consecutive games.</LD>
<TE>   Against a Raven defense that stepped up its play without Ray
Lewis, Vick completed only 12 of 24 passes for 136 yards, was sacked
three times, had minus-five yards rushing, fumbled twice and threw
his first interception of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Falcons (5-3) won their fourth in a row -- the team's
longest streak since 1998, the season they reached the Super Bowl.
"You're going to have games like this," Vick said. "My performance
overall was not good, but we got the win. That's what counts."</TE>
<TE>   The Falcons lost a 14-point lead, but went ahead for good on Jay
Feely's 40-yard field goal with 2:02 left in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta had built a 17-3 lead when Duckett, sidelined the previous
game with a foot injury, scored on a one-yard run in the second
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Ravens (3-5) pulled within 17-10 with 1:56 left in the half on
Jeff Blake's seven-yard touchdown pass to Travis Taylor, culminating
a nine-play, 92-yard drive</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore scored on its first possession of the second half, with
fullback Alan Ricard rambling up the middle for a 19-yard touchdown.
But, the Ravens failed to move into Falcon territory the rest of the
game.</TE>

<KH>WASHINGTON 14, SEATTLE 3</KH>
<HD>Redskins Win It on Run</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Kenny Watson was steady, so it didn't matter that Shane Matthews
wasn't spectacular.</LD>
<LD>   Watson ran for 110 yards in place of injured Stephen Davis, and
Matthews threw two first-half touchdown passes to lead the Washington
Redskins past the struggling Seattle Seahawks, 14-3, Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "That was one of the most unusual games I have ever coached,"
Washington Coach Steve Spurrier said. "We just didn't do much.</LD>
<TE>   "We didn't throw or catch very well the whole game, but
fortunately we won."</TE>
<TE>   Matthews was 10 for 27 for 114 yards with one interception. But he
preserved his status as Spurrier's starter of the moment by throwing
an 11-yard touchdown pass to Darnerien McCants and a 19-yarder to Rod
Gardner.</TE>
<TE>   "He is still our best quarterback," Spurrier said.</TE>
<TE>   With the Washington defense forcing two fumbles by Seattle
quarterback Matt Hasselbeck and keeping the Seahawks out of the end
zone, the Redskins (4-4) didn't need to score in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   "We're playing close football games and we're losing them, for
whatever reason," said Seattle Coach Mike Holmgren, whose team fell
to 2-6. "The cumulative toll is starting to catch up with us."</TE>

<HD>Milestone, Win Elude Rice Against 49ers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jerry Rice faced the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday for the first time
in the regular season since he left for the other side of San
Francisco Bay to play for Oakland after the 2000 season.</LD>
<LD>   The Raiders lost, 23-20, in overtime at Oakland for their fourth
consecutive loss after a 4-0 start, and Rice didn't even spend much
time on the field. The 49ers had the ball for the final 30 plays, and
all Rice could do was watch.</LD>
<LD>   "Tough one today, huh?" Rice said, clapping his hands together.
"It's a tough one to swallow. You've just got to deal with it and
move on. I'm just disappointed, not only for me but for the whole
team."</LD>
<TE>   Rice did finish as the Raiders' top receiver, catching six passes
for 74 yards, but he missed a chance to get the 200th touchdown of
his career against his former team. His first 186 came during 16
seasons with San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   A close-up photo of Rice in his helmet and Raider uniform adorned
the entire cover of the game-day program.</TE>
<TE>   He never really wanted to leave the 49ers, figuring he would
finish his career with them. But during his final seasons with the
team, his role diminished. Fighting the salary cap, the 49ers
determined they could no longer afford him.</TE>
<TE>   That's why beating them would have been sweet.</TE>
<TE>   When the 49ers had a third-and-five situation in the third
quarter, Rice threw his hands in the air on the sideline, trying to
spark life into the quiet crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very frustrating," Rice said. "But you've got to deal with
it. We still have eight games."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The NFL has to be pleased with what has been happening in the
first nine weeks of the season. A look at some numbers:</TE>
<TE>   * Games are averaging 43.9 points -- the most through the first
nine weeks of a season in 38 years (45.2 in 1964).</TE>
<TE>   * Games are averaging 433.6 passing yards, the most in seven years
(439.2 in 1995).</TE>
<TE>   * The 23 touchdowns scored on kickoffs and punt returns are the
most through a season's first nine weeks.</TE>
<TE>   * Forty-seven percent of games have been decided by seven points
or fewer and 24% by three or fewer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's key injuries:</TE>
<TE>   * Seattle lost veteran linebacker Chad Brown for the rest of the
season after he broke his right foot. Seahawk safety Marcus Robertson
left because of a concussion in the first quarter and didn't return.</TE>
<TE>   * The Raiders got a scare when defensive end Tony Bryant was
carted off the field because of a spine injury. Bryant fell hard on
the Coliseum grass 5:50 into overtime.</TE>
<TE>   He was taken to a hospital and the Raiders said he had feeling in
his extremities.</TE>
<TE>   * Steeler defensive back Mike Logan injured his hamstring.</TE>

<HD>Cohen's Victory Validates Switch to a New Coach</HD>
<DH>The Skate Canada champion says leaving John Nicks was hard,
but she knew it was part of stepping up her skills.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>QUEBEC CITY, Canada</DL>
<LD>After yet another promising start dissolved into a dissatisfying
result, Sasha Cohen knew she had reached a crossroads.</LD>
<LD>   The teenager from Laguna Niguel thought she was well prepared for
this year's world championships, only to stumble on several elements
she had nailed in practice. Her fourth-place finish was a wake-up
call.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm at a point where I want to be the best skater, and I just
didn't feel like the training conditions were what I needed," said
Cohen, who skated weekdays at Aliso Viejo with Coach John Nicks and
weekends at Lake Arrowhead. "I was on the ice for two 45-minute
sessions with 15 or 20 kids. It was more of a social environment."</LD>
<TE>   A visit to Connecticut for choreography work with Nikolai Morozov
and Tatiana Tarasova persuaded Cohen the Russian duo could lift her
out of her rut. After much thought, her parents agreed to uproot the
family so she could train with Tarasova, whose impressive roster
includes Salt Lake City gold medalist Alexei Yagudin.</TE>
<TE>   The benefits were apparent at Skate Canada, Cohen's first Grand
Prix victory. Although the field was relatively thin, her enhanced
speed and agility complimented her artistry and offered promise of
even better performances to come.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day I'm more and more sure this was the right thing," Cohen
said Sunday. "It's all about the training there. I have as much ice
time as I want. I have three hours of ice a day and with only one
other kid and two coaches. It's real intense the whole time and I'm
completely focused....</TE>
<TE>   "It was really hard to leave Mr. Nicks. He was my coach since
intermediates. As a person, it was hard to imagine anyone else
putting me on the ice, but I realized for my skating to progress, I
really needed a higher lever of training."</TE>
<TE>   Her mother, Galina, said the family regards the move as an
adventure and someday will return to California. They're renting
their Laguna Niguel home and living in a rented home in Avon, Conn.,
where Sasha's sister, Natasha, a high school freshman, studies piano.
The girls' father, Roger, an attorney, commutes between coasts.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't about winning Olympic gold. It's more about improving
as a skater," Galina said. "She has a chance to fulfill her
potential. Whether that's Olympic gold or not, who knows? That's four
years away. I can't think that far. She can be much better as a
skater, and she feels she's training and improving. Every day she
comes home and says she's progressing, and that's a great thing."</TE>
<TE>   Tarasova said her coaching team is merely polishing the gem Nicks
shaped.</TE>
<TE>   "She have a very professional coach before, the best coach in the
U.S.," Tarasova said. "I know this coach all my life. We compete
together. I had [Irina] Rodnina and [Alexander] Zaitsev, he had [Tai]
Babilonia and [Randy] Gardner.</TE>
<TE>   "He open this talent, because Sasha is real 100% talent. Talent
like this is coming maybe one in 10 years. The last one like this was
[1994 Olympic champion] Oksana Baiul. I try to help her open her
talent more. Maybe I do something special for this unbelievable
talent."</TE>
<TE>   With two more Grand Prix assignments -- Lalique Trophy Nov. 14-17
in Paris and Cup of Russia Nov. 21-24 in Moscow -- Cohen is focusing
on consistency and avoiding the stumbles she made in her Skate Canada
long program, which she blamed on inadequate conditioning.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now I'm thinking of Lalique and Russia and of getting
national and world titles," said Cohen, who plans to resume her quest
to land a quadruple salchow later this year. "Those are my goals for
this season.</TE>
<TE>   "I still have a lot to accomplish and a lot to prove, so I don't
feel like I'm just waiting for the 2006 Olympics. I've got lots of
stuff to do."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Elena Grushina and Ruslan Goncharov of Ukraine, also coached by
Tarasova, won all three phases of the ice dance competition to win
the title. Melissa Gregory and Denis Petukhov of the U.S. were
eighth.</TE>

<HD>Scoring System 'Huge Success'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The proposed cumulative scoring system, which got its second test at
Skate Canada, was declared "a huge success" by International Skating
Union consultant Ted Barton. However, ISU officials said they must
refine some provisions, such as weighting elements according to their
difficulty and defining the "well-balanced program" skaters must
perform.</LD>
<LD>   An expert observer identified each move to an inputter, who
displayed it on the computers before 14 judges. Judges rated the
execution on a scale of minus-3 to plus-3 for the technical mark and
then awarded a presentation score. A computer randomly selected seven
scores to determine the marks, but the ISU wouldn't say if the
results matched those of the interim system being used.</LD>
<LD>   ISU Secretary-General Fredi Schmid said a finished version could
be in place next season.</LD>

<LD>Charmaine Hooper scored two goals and Christine Sinclair added a
third Sunday as Canada shut out Costa Rica, 3-0, in the CONCACAF
Women's Gold Cup in front of 3,256 at Centennial Stadium in Victoria,
Canada.</LD>
<LD>   The victory, Canada's third in a row in the eight-nation
tournament, earned it first place in its group and set up a semifinal
match Wednesday night against Mexico in Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   The United States, also unbeaten, will play Costa Rica in the
other semifinal earlier that evening.</LD>
<TE>   Hooper put the Canadians ahead by firing a penalty kick into the
lower right-hand corner of the net in the 28th minute after Silvana
Burtini had been knocked down in the penalty area. Hooper doubled
Canada's lead three minutes before halftime by chipping a shot from
18 yards over the head of Costa Rican goalkeeper Marie Claire Herra.</TE>
<TE>   The two goals gave Hooper, the Canadian captain, six for the
tournament and a share of the scoring lead with Sinclair and U.S.
forward Tiffeny Milbrett.</TE>
<TE>   Sinclair reclaimed the top spot by scoring Canada's third goal in
the 49th minute, but although the Canadians outshot the Ticas, 17-2,
they could not add to their total.</TE>
<TE>   In the day's earlier game, Haiti defeated Jamaica, 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   Fire Coach Set</TE>
<TE>   According to Soccer America magazine, Major League Soccer's
Chicago Fire today is expected to name Dave Sarachan as its new coach
following the departure of Bob Bradley for the New York/New Jersey
MetroStars.</TE>
<TE>   Sarachan was an assistant to Bruce Arena on the U.S. team that
reached the 2002 World Cup quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   Victims Honored</TE>
<TE>   In a gesture that typified the reaction of grief-stricken Italians
in the wake of last week's earthquake that killed 29, including 26
children, Francesco Totti, the captain of AS Roma, Sunday offered up
for auction the uniform he had worn in Wednesday's historic European
Champions League victory over Real Madrid in Spain.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd of 55,000 at the Olympic Stadium in Rome stayed silent
for 10 minutes before the Roma-Perugia game, and similar silent
tributes were paid at matches throughout Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Arsenal Prevail</TE>
<TE>   English champion Arsenal ended a four-game losing streak -- its
longest in 19 years -- with a 1-0 victory over Fulham in an English
Premier League game Sunday. An own goal by Fulham's Steve Marlet off
a corner kick by his France national team teammate, Arsenal winger
Thierry Henry, made the difference.</TE>
<TE>   More memorable than the victory, however, was the postgame comment
of Fulham Coach Jean Tigana, a former World Cup midfielder for
France, who is worried about injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not have a big squad and hope my players stay fit," Tigana
said. "In fact, I would prefer my wife to get injured instead of my
players -- I can't come out of retirement and play."</TE>
<TE>   100th Norwegian Cup</TE>
<TE>   Striker Bjorn Arild Levernes scored an early goal for Valerenga
and the Oslo-based club went on to win the 100th Norwegian Cup final,
1-0, over Odd Grenland in front of 25,000 fans Sunday at the national
stadium in Oslo.</TE>
<TE>   Littbarski Fired</TE>
<TE>   Pierre Littbarski, a World Cup winner with Germany in 1990, was
fired Sunday as coach of MSV Duisburg of the German second division
after saying he would like to coach rival Union Berlin.</TE>
<TE>   "This is no basis for a long-term collaboration," said Walter
Hellmich, Duisburg's president. "He was a great player, but he still
must prove himself as a coach."</TE>

<KH>PITTSBURGH 23, CLEVELAND 20</KH>
<HD>Steelers Clearly Heading North</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>Even during the darkest moments this season, the Pittsburgh Steelers
never considered throwing in the Terrible Towel.</LD>
<LD>   "There are 52 guys in there that saved the season," said
quarterback Tommy Maddox, who has led Pittsburgh's turnaround from an
0-2 start. "We have a lot of season left, but I can't say enough
about the guys in this locker room."</LD>
<LD>   Maddox threw two touchdown passes and Amos Zereoue ran for a
career-high 111 yards as the Steelers rallied from a 14-point deficit
in the second quarter to defeat Cleveland, 23-20, Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   With their fourth consecutive victory, the Steelers (5-3) took
command of the weak AFC North, in which they have won all four of
their games.</TE>
<TE>   "You can grow from slow starts and having to overcome that,"
Pittsburgh Coach Bill Cowher said. "This team grew today."</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Northcutt scored on an 87-yard punt return for the Browns
(4-5), who came in hoping to avenge an overtime loss at Pittsburgh
earlier this season and establish themselves as playoff contenders.</TE>
<TE>   The Steelers had other plans.</TE>
<TE>   "We obviously didn't make the statement we wanted to make," Brown
quarterback Tim Couch said.</TE>
<TE>   The Pittsburgh defense swarmed Couch all game and limited
Cleveland to 193 total yards -- 36 rushing -- and nine first downs.</TE>
<TE>   And when the Steelers had the ball, they kept it. Pittsburgh's
time of possession was 42:18 to Cleveland's 17:50, and the Steelers
ran 85 plays to the Browns' 42. Cleveland was also done in by 11
penalties.</TE>
<TE>   Maddox, 4-1 since replacing Kordell Stewart as the starting
quarterback, threw touchdown passes in the second quarter to Hines
Ward and Mark Bruener to allow the Steelers to overcome a 17-3
deficit. Maddox, the former insurance salesman and UCLA and XFL star,
completed 23 of 42 passes for 239 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Peterson accounted for the rest of the Steelers' scoring with
field goals of 43, 28 and 42 yards.</TE>

<HD>Women's Tennis Gets Act Together</HD>
<DH>Top female players know perception can be as pivotal as
reality, so they step up on tour issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Dillman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three of the four women's quarterfinals in the French Open in June
could have easily been finals in previous years: defending champion
Jennifer Capriati vs. Jelena Dokic; three-time champion Monica Seles
vs. Venus Williams; and former champion Mary Pierce vs. Serena
Williams.</LD>
<LD>   Femmes de Paris.</LD>
<LD>   Only the femmes were relegated to the secondary show venue at
Roland Garros, Court Suzanne Lenglen. The WTA objected before, during
and afterward, and Capriati, Venus and Serena criticized the
decision. Serena called on the players to push the issue, saying, "It
can't be one person pushing the boat, you have to have more."</LD>
<TE>   Well, the hands on the deck got the job done. Kevin Wulff, the
WTA's chief executive, told The Times in a recent interview that the
tour reached an agreement with the French Open on the issue. At least
two of the women's quarterfinals will be held on Center Court, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The French Open has agreed to treat the quarterfinals equal with
the men's," Wulff said. "This is an important thing. They [the
players] were supportive in making sure the tennis powers were very
aware of it."</TE>
<TE>   Paris is only one leading example of how the top players are
stepping forward more often on key tour issues, realizing perception
is sometimes as important as reality. Closer to home, this is what
happened in March during an often-contentious fight to find a new
home for the season-ending WTA Championships. The event moved from
New York to Munich, Germany, last year, and attendance plummeted from
94,133 to 36,500.</TE>
<TE>   Venus Williams skipped the event because of a wrist injury, and
Seles has refused to play tournaments in Germany since her 1993
stabbing in Hamburg. And organizers of sporting events, in the United
States and abroad, have felt the economic downturn since 9/11.</TE>
<TE>   Once some of the marquee players realized there was a chance to
elevate the WTA Championships, lifting it out of a secondary status,
they got behind the effort to shift the event to Staples Center.
Among the most outspoken were Seles and Lindsay Davenport. The event,
which starts Wednesday and finishes with the Monday night final,
features 16 singles players and eight doubles teams in a
single-elimination format.</TE>
<TE>   And the three who have come to Los Angeles for various appearances
to drum up interest in the tournament have been Seles, Serena
Williams and Davenport.</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, all three are IMG clients. The management firm was
the primary opposition behind the move to Staples, objecting to the
proliferation of tournaments in Southern California. IMG has ties to
the Indian Wells event in March and Manhattan Beach in August.
Officials at the San Diego tournament, which is the week before
Manhattan Beach, were worried about over-saturation too.</TE>
<TE>   But the three players, in particular, realized what is good for
them could be beneficial for the tour. Serena Williams is interested
in an acting career and will appear on the "The Tonight Show With Jay
Leno" this week and may work as a correspondent for "Entertainment
Tonight" from the WTA's fashion show Monday night. Seles always
wanted to finish her career by playing in the WTA Championships at
least one more time, and that, of course, wouldn't have happened in
Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Davenport can stay in her own home at Laguna Beach until just
before the event. And she pointed out that it makes sense to be in a
major U.S. market with so many Americans at the top of the world
rankings. The last 10 Grand Slam tournaments were won by Serena
(three), Venus (four) and Capriati (three). Among the 16 players who
qualified for the singles spots, six are Americans -- Serena and
Venus, Capriati, Davenport, Seles and Chanda Rubin.</TE>
<TE>   Officials for the event would not reveal advance ticket sales. Not
surprisingly, momentum slowed during the Angels' run to the World
Series championship.</TE>
<TE>   "They've got some work to do," Wulff said recently. "They're less
than they thought they'd be at this stage. They started off like
gangbusters and then it slowed down. We probably should have done
more over the summer. It's solid. But they're used to selling out
here.</TE>
<TE>   "Momentum will pick up again. They're optimistic."</TE>
<TE>   Tournament director John Arrix said that has happened in the last
week. "Tennis is different from any other sport," he said Friday.
"It's not going to be an instant success. It's not like a Rolling
Stones concert where people hit the phones. It's a long-term
relationship. We've had an event in Jacksonville for 23 years. It
takes some time. There's so much out there."</TE>
<TE>   That's one of the problems facing both the men's and women's
tours. One week, the men may be spread across the globe, playing in
Sweden, Russia and Switzerland. It's not quite as extreme on the
women's side, but Davenport would like to see a model based on the
men's Masters Series, in which the top players are required to play
nine tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to go back through the schedule and see if maybe they
could schedule the tournaments a little bit better," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Wulff said that 13 WTA tournaments established all-time attendance
records in 2002. The WTA has reached a deal with Porsche as its North
American sponsor, according to the Sports Business Journal. And Wulff
said a long-term international television deal will be announced
during the WTA Championships, as well as other agreements.</TE>
<TE>   He said the WTA is making a necessary move from purely governance
and service to one of "a more commercial entity."</TE>
<TE>   "There's a feeling the tournaments would market themselves," he
said. "There was never the ability to bring in any funding to expand
beyond that. In the world of sport, there's a new economic model
needed. The tournaments had maxed out their ability to sell their
existing inventory."</TE>
<TE>   Davenport acknowledged the new business reality.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great time for women's tennis, but then the economy is not
doing so well, so it's hard to ask all these companies to invest all
this time and money with us when obviously they're struggling
themselves," she said. "There certainly has never been a better time
or more exciting time than there is now."</TE>
<TE>   Commercial success at Staples, for example, can only accentuate
that point.</TE>
<TE>   "If the players continue to play at the level they're playing and
continue to try and do all the promotions they can, [the tour] has no
choice but to grow and get better and better," Davenport said.</TE>

<KH>TENNESSEE 23, INDIANAPOLIS 15</KH>
<HD>Turnovers Are Feast for Titans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The Tennessee Titans didn't need big plays from Steve McNair or Eddie
George. A little ball control and a strong defensive effort were
enough Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Keith Bulluck returned a fumble 61 yards for one touchdown, and
Peter Sirmon's interception led to a second touchdown as the Titans
moved into a first-place tie in the AFC South with a 23-15 victory
over the Indianapolis Colts.</LD>
<LD>   "We talked all week about the Colts being a turnover team. When
they get the ball on turnovers, they've won games," Titan Coach Jeff
Fisher said. "When they turn it over, they struggle."</LD>
<TE>   The Titans (4-4) forced the issue Sunday, and even though their
offense managed only 198 yards, the defense made sure it was more
than enough to give the team its third consecutive win.</TE>
<TE>   Indianapolis (4-4) lost its third in a row. The Colts struggled
early and fell behind 20-0 for the second game in a row because of
three first-half turnovers that the Titans turned into 17 points.</TE>
<TE>   For the Colts, it was an all-too-familiar story line. "Today's
game was very similar to the last two weeks, where we just get the
big deficits and dig ourselves a hole and don't have enough to fight
back," Colt Coach Tony Dungy said. "It's disappointing."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem was that the Colts again failed to establish
their running game. They were playing without two-time NFL rushing
leader Edgerrin James and his backup, Ricky Williams, who was a late
scratch after being expected to start. Both were inactive because of
hamstring injuries, and the Titans took advantage of their absence.</TE>
<TE>   While the Colts produced 378 total yards and James Mungro ran 16
times for 60 yards, Indianapolis didn't score until the game's final
13 minutes. By then they had fallen behind, 23-0.</TE>
<TE>   George rushed 22 times for 95 yards, while McNair completed 14 of
19 passes for only 82 yards and one touchdown -- but it was good
enough.</TE>

<KH>UCLA REWIND</KH>
<HD>Bruins Try Stock Line of One Game at Time</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>UCLA is like the little old lady who drives with her hands gripping
the steering wheel and eyes locked on the pavement two feet in front
of the hood ornament.</LD>
<LD>   No telling what's down the road. She can't see it and doesn't
care.</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins are taking the same approach, at least publicly.</LD>
<TE>   The rivalry game against USC, the one they haven't won since 1998,
is only two games away. But please, do not mention Palmer and
Polamalu yet.</TE>
<TE>   The regular-season finale against Washington State, the current
Pacific 10 Conference leader, also looms. Sorry, Gesser doesn't
register.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is a bowl game, something new to many of the Bruins.
Even the seniors have been to only one, the Sun Bowl two years ago.
After defeating Washington, 34-24, Saturday, UCLA (6-3, 3-2) is bowl
eligible.</TE>
<TE>   How about a little excitement?</TE>
<TE>   "A bowl game is too far down the schedule to even think about,"
cornerback Ricky Manning said. "I only know we play Arizona next
week."</TE>
<TE>   That would be last-place Arizona, a team that has lost five Pac-10
games in a row, including a 38-3 debacle to Oregon State on Saturday.
It is a team that would be easy to overlook, except that these Bruins
are talking about the Wildcats as if they were Fiesta Bowl opponents.</TE>
<TE>   So it appears UCLA indeed has taken the hard lessons of last
year's late-season fade to heart.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins know a victory over Arizona would assure them of a
winning record and a 5-1 mark on the road, remarkable for a team that
plays 22 freshmen and starts six.</TE>
<TE>   And they know a victory would enable them to enter an off week
before the USC game with the sunny disposition a three-game winning
streak stirs.</TE>
<TE>   Wait. Perish even those fleeting thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   "All the what-ifs and records and streaks are just distractions,"
freshman linebacker Spencer Havner said. "The seniors learned from
that and they've warned us. So I guess we'll talk about Arizona."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's record in November was 2-6 the last three years, including
0-3 last season. So the scheduling of open dates Nov. 16 and Nov. 30
this season is fortuitous.</TE>
<TE>   Now the time off is a plus for another reason. A roster that
remained nearly injury-free during the nonconference schedule is beat
up.</TE>
<TE>   Safety Jibril Raymo (safety) and cornerback Matt Clark (foot) sat
out against Washington. Cornerback Matt Ware left the game because of
a hamstring injury. And Manning, Jarrad Page, Ben Emanuel and Joe
Hunter are playing with injuries.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, defensive tackle Rodney Leisle, who has sat out the
five Pac-10 games because of a foot injury, is walking normally and
could return against USC.</TE>
<TE>   Running back Manuel White has been out with a hamstring injury
since the first quarter of the Pac-10 opener against Oregon State. He
won't take his job back, not after Tyler Ebell has rattled off five
consecutive 100-yard rushing performances. But the 240-pound White's
blocking, receiving and short-yardage rushing skills have been
missed.</TE>
<TE>   And senior quarterback Cory Paus is recovering from surgery on his
fibula and has aspirations of playing in a bowl game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's nonconference schedule was rated among the most difficult.
The opponents have lived up to the billing.</TE>
<TE>   No. 24 Colorado State, which UCLA defeated in its opener, is 8-2
and 4-0 in the Mountain West Conference after defeating Air Force on
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma State, which UCLA defeated on the road, upset Texas A&amp;M
on Saturday to even its record at 4-4.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado's victory over the Bruins sparked a five-game winning
streak that ended with a loss to Oklahoma on Saturday. The No. 18
Buffaloes are 6-3.</TE>
<TE>   Even the San Diego State Aztecs, winless when UCLA beat them,
43-7, had won three Mountain West games in a row before losing to
Brigham Young on Saturday and are 3-6.</TE>

<HD>Trojans Move Up to No. 10</HD>

<LD>USC was idle over the weekend, but that did not stop the Trojans from
moving into the Associated Press top 10 for the first time in more
than two years.</LD>
<LD>   The Trojans on Sunday jumped one spot to No. 10. The last time
they were ranked that high was Sept. 30, 2000, when they were No. 8
going into a Pacific 10 Conference game at Oregon State. USC lost to
the Beavers, 31-21, and dropped to No. 18 the next week.</LD>
<LD>   This is USC's highest AP ranking this late in a season since 1989.</LD>
<TE>   USC, 6-2 overall, 4-1 in the Pac-10, resumes practice today in
preparation for Saturday's conference game at Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans had hoped to get some help last week in the Rose Bowl
race from Arizona State, but the Sun Devils lost to
conference-leading Washington State, 44-22, on Saturday at Pullman,
Wash.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State (8-1, 5-0) moved up three spots to No. 5 in the
AP poll and took over sole possession of first place in the Pac-10
with conference games remaining against Oregon, Washington and UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   USC is tied for second place with Arizona State (7-3, 4-1). The
Trojans must win the rest of their conference games, and Washington
State must lose at least twice for USC to have a shot at the Rose
Bowl. The Trojans, who lost to Washington State in overtime Oct. 5,
have remaining Pac-10 games against Stanford, Arizona State and UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC has not defeated Stanford since 1998. In 1999, the Trojans
blew a 21-0 first-quarter lead and lost, 35-31, at the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Stanford scored 12 points in the last 5:22 and
defeated the Trojans, 32-30, when quarterback Chris Lewis connected
with Jamien McCullum on a 20-yard touchdown pass play with no time
left. Last season, Stanford built a 21-0 lead and held on for a 21-16
victory at the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Offensive tackle Jacob Rogers, who sat out last week because of a
sore right knee, will rejoin workouts and is expected to start
against Stanford. Receiver Kareem Kelly, who is a nursing a sprained
right ankle, also will practice and will play Saturday.</TE>

<KH>TAMPA BAY 38, MINNESOTA 24</KH>
<HD>Johnson &amp; Johnson Heal an Ailing Offense</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TAMPA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Finally, a breakout game for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' offense.</LD>
<LD>   Brad Johnson threw for 313 yards and a career-high five
touchdowns, and the Buccaneers played their best game on offense for
first-year Coach Jon Gruden in Sunday's 38-24 victory over the
Minnesota Vikings.</LD>
<LD>   "We're moving in the right direction," said Keyshawn Johnson, who
had nine receptions for 133 yards and two touchdowns -- all season
highs. "This was a big step. What's important now is we keep moving
and get better and better."</LD>
<TE>   Karl Williams, Rickey Dudley and Mike Alstott also had touchdown
catches for the Buccaneers who matched the 1979 team for the best
nine-game start in team history at 7-2</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota (2-6) has lost 15 consecutive road games, including the
playoffs. The Vikings are 0-5 at Raymond James Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "Fifteen in a row, it's tough," said Viking Coach Mike Tice, who
changed the team's travel routine -- arriving in Florida a day
earlier than usual -- in hopes of ending the skid.</TE>
<TE>   "We had plenty of meetings, plenty of time for football, plenty of
time together. I felt like it would give them a training-camp
weekend, where they could think about nothing but the game.
Obviously, it helped some of us. It didn't help all of us."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, returning after sitting out a game because of a fractured
left rib, completed 19 of 31 passes and didn't throw an interception.
Tampa Bay's offensive line didn't allow a sack after previously
giving up 21.</TE>
<TE>   The Buccaneers paid a hefty price (four high draft picks, $8
million) to pry Gruden away from the Oakland Raiders in hopes that
the NFL's youngest head coach could use his skill at assembling an
offense to make a defense-minded team a championship contender.</TE>
<TE>   But until Sunday, Tampa Bay had been winning mostly because of
defense, which had allowed only six touchdowns and scored five
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Against the Vikings, who were ranked 31st in pass defense and 28th
overall, the Buccaneers gained a season-high 446 yards and punted
only twice.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what we see in practice all the time," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota, which has the league's worst turnover differential,
fumbled the opening kickoff and went downhill from there. The Vikings
also hurt themselves with penalties, including a first-quarter
holding call against guard Corbin Lacina that nullified Daunte
Culpepper's 40-yard touchdown pass to Randy Moss.</TE>
<TE>   The Buccaneers forced three turnovers and sacked Culpepper three
times.</TE>
<TE>   "There ain't no excuses," said Moss, who was held to four
receptions for 41 yards. "I just can't see how we can play well at
home against a good team like Chicago, and then come down here to
Tampa and fold under pressure."</TE>
