<LD>NEW YORK--Looking north from the 35th-floor apartment in a tony
building on Central Park South, the view of the Gotham green is epic.
On a recent evening at cocktail hour, you could even catch a glimpse
of the future of opera in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   A small klatch of supporters, many of them with big names, big
wallets or both, gathered in the quietly opulent digs of arts patrons
Elaine and Lee Elman to watch composer Deborah Drattell present her
score of a new opera, "Nicholas and Alexandra," to Los Angeles Opera
artistic director Placido Domingo. "I could have just sent it to
L.A.," said the petite brunet to the celebrity tenor, who arrived
straight from seeing an opera that afternoon, and en route to conduct
another that night. "But I insisted on giving you the score myself."</LD>
<LD>   Drattell's opus, with libretto by Nicholas von Hoffman, is one of
several new operas to be commissioned by Los Angeles Opera since
Domingo took the company helm. It'll be the first to hit the boards,
with its world premiere launching the 2003-04 season, starring
Domingo and conducted by Mstislav Rostropovich, in a co-production
with Paris' Theatre du Chatelet.</LD>
<TE>   A phalanx of white-jacketed waiters circulated, bearing silver
trays laden with caviar and sundry other upscale nosherei, and green
napkins monogrammed with the hosts' names. (Lee is a lawyer, real
estate investor and former commissioner of cultural affairs for New
York City; Elaine is a former stockbroker.) Tony-winning playwrights
Terrence McNally and Wendy Wasserstein were on hand to support their
fellow collaborator on the 1999 New York City Opera trilogy "Central
Park." Wasserstein and Drattell are now working together on a second
opera. And McNally's "Dead Man Walking," recently staged at Opera
Pacific, is on a roll these days, with productions slated across the
country. Present as well was grande dame Kitty Carlisle Hart, herself
no stranger to the art of singing, impeccable in a tangerine day
suit.</TE>
<TE>   Catherine Wichterman, program officer for the performing arts at
the New York-based Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and a friend of
Drattell's, mentioned that the foundation has given its first-ever
grant to L.A. Opera.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to support opera companies that can contribute to the
development of new work," Wichterman said. "We are interested in
experimentation, and Domingo is clearly a person with a vision."</TE>
<TE>   Mellon has chipped in $750,000 over three years, to help pay for
commissions, including the 2002-03 premiere of Luciano Berio's new
orchestration of "The Coronation of Poppea," the 2003-04 premiere of
"Nicholas and Alexandra" and the 2004-05 premiere of a new opera by
John Williams. In fact, Edgar Baitzel, the company's director of
artistic operations, said that the subject of directing the Williams
opera was being broached with a Very Hot film director in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Drattell, who lives with her husband and four kids in Brooklyn,
wore a black-and-white animal-print skirt, strappy heels and
peppermint-pink toenails. Just hours earlier, she'd been frantically
photocopying the score in preparation for the ceremonial handoff.</TE>
<TE>   The three spiral-bound volumes were covered in baby blue, and tied
with a gold mesh bow. "Leave it to me to wrap it in a ribbon that
cuts your hands before you have to conduct," a somewhat nervous
Drattell said to Domingo, who would shortly be leading "Rigoletto" at
the Met. "And they weigh 10 pounds. So don't feel pressured to take
it with you."</TE>
<TE>   When it came time for the speechifying, Drattell went first. As a
child growing up in New York, she had taken part in a program to
introduce students to music. When the man in charge asked her what
instrument she wanted to play, the 7-year-old future composer had no
doubts. "I want to be a violinist," she told him.</TE>
<TE>   "'And why do you want to play the violin, little girl?' 'Because I
want to be the concertmaster.'</TE>
<TE>   "It was that same sense of chutzpah when I decided I wanted to
write an opera for Placido Domingo," Drattell explained.</TE>
<TE>   "You were the total source of inspiration for the piece," she told
the tenor.. "And now that I've gotten the check, I can say that I
would have paid you to let me write this opera."</TE>
<TE>   Domingo took the opportunity to do his duty as an artistic
director, schmoozing with the influential and well-heeled
well-wishers. "We want the company to be representative of all the
different types of works--new works, and especially having those
works written by American composers," he said. Citing the
centuries-old reliance of artists on benefactors, Domingo gave the
nod to the Mellon Foundation's Wichterman in particular for
encouraging composers such as Drattell.</TE>
<TE>   "Nicholas and Alexandra" came to Domingo's attention when Baitzel
urged him to hear excerpts of the work in progress presented in a
showcase organized by Drattell at New York City Opera, where she used
to be composer in residence. "The moment I heard it I knew it should
be the first world premiere" for L.A. Opera, Domingo recalled.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked her to make just one change," he said. "She told me she
had written Nicholas for me. I said, 'Let me be Rasputin. Just for
once, I don't want to be the suffering tenor.' I will be killed, with
20 bullet holes in my body, to gorgeous music." (Baritone Rodney
Gilfry, a longtime L.A. Opera favorite, will assay the role of Czar
Nicholas, with Nancy Gustafson as his wife Alexandra.)</TE>
<TE>   Turning to Drattell, Domingo added a coda. "I thank you for the
change," he said. "And I congratulate you."</TE>
<TE>   Riding down in the elevator afterward, the elegant Carlisle Hart
chatted demurely about her own musical muse. "Lyric mezzo?" queried
the opera's Baitzel.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to be a soprano," she replied. "Yes, I sing lower now--I'm
very old. The words are more clear, though."</TE>

<HD>Salonen Renews Promise of Mahler's First</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We used to think of Mahler's First Symphony as the somewhat puny,
underdeveloped younger sibling of the Viennese composer's massive
later works. It was shorter than an hour and easy to like, so we
never took it very seriously.</LD>
<LD>   That was before Esa-Pekka Salonen discovered it. He first
conducted it in a thrilling, fully realized performance by the Los
Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl in the summer of 1999.
Subsequently, he took it, and the orchestra, on tour, then opened the
fall season with it that October.</LD>
<LD>   This week, he brings it back to the Los Angeles Philharmonic's
home at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. Thursday night, the thrills
continued.</LD>
<TE>   We were mistaken, all those years, to discount the worth of this
seminal Mahler piece. It predicts and underlines all the qualities of
his subsequent symphonic canvases. And it contains, as heard in
Salonen's probing, cannily laid out reading, all the emotional wallop
so deeply expanded, and consequently cherished, in the monumental
later works.</TE>
<TE>   What Salonen finds here--that we missed in many previous
performances--is the richness of emotion, the many colorful feelings
in each part of this tightly constructed monument. He allows the
entirety to build in intensity through its four movements, saving the
crowning series of climaxes for the stormy finale. But, along the
way, he savors the wealth of details in each part and allows each
movement its own glow and stylistic specificity.</TE>
<TE>   The first half of this program was another pearl beyond price in
the pure, unfettered, virtually definitive performance of Brahms'
Violin Concerto by soloist Hilary Hahn, 22. Hahn played this work on
this stage three years ago, to justifiably high praise.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday, she again made the work her own, and again did it
selflessly. Technically immaculate, musically magisterial and in
every moment communicative, this reading reinstated not only the
work's status as one of Brahms' masterpieces but also as one long,
unbroken song. Salonen and the Philharmonic collaborated
wholeheartedly.</TE>

<HD>Paris Combo Embraces Universal Themes</HD>
<DH>The multinational ensemble combines diversity with
musicality in an engaging fashion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Popular music in France has always had more to do with blending and
combining than with isolating into specific genres. From the early
days, in which the boundaries between cabaret and jazz were
constantly circumvented, to the present-day potpourri of world, jazz,
pop and dance music streaming out of the Paris studios, there has
always been a belief in universality rather than separateness.</LD>
<LD>   The performance by Paris Combo at the Skirball Cultural Center on
Thursday night was a classic example of that universality in action.</LD>
<LD>   Consider the elements of the ensemble: Belle du Berry, the singer
and writer of many of the group's witty, often irony-tinged songs
(whose themes are apparent in titles such as "Mais Que Fait la NASA,"
"Berceuse Insomniaque" and "Traits de Caractere"), performed with a
blend of cabaret theatricality and smoothly rhythmic phrasing.</LD>
<TE>   David Lewis, moving from trumpet and fluegelhorn to piano, added
touches of Miles Davis timbres alternating with rhapsodic keyboard
work. Guitarist Potzi repeatedly affirmed his familiarity and
affection for Django Reinhardt. Drummer-singer-whistler
Francois-Francois mixed '30s swing style with driving bop rhythms.
And bassist Mano Razanajato, reminiscent of Richard Bona, offered
superb bass work, smooth balladry and a knack for scat singing with
his improvised solo lines.</TE>
<TE>   A true global smorgasbord, in other words, and it is seasoned by
the fact that Du Berry and Francois-Francois are French, Potzi is a
Gypsy, Razanajato is from Madagascar and Lewis is Australian.</TE>
<TE>   Diverse influences alone, of course, do not necessarily make for
first-rate music. Paris Combo supported its musical diversity with
impressive musicality, which often surfaced in relatively subtle
fashion as pieces casually performed in such offbeat meters as 7/4
and 11/8, not exactly the everyday stuff of either pop or jazz.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the pieces were assembled with a consistently
creative sense of contrast and pacing, positioning brief instrumental
solos in and around Du Berry's vocals, underscoring melodies with
foot-tapping ostinato rhythmic patterns and occasionally breaking out
in straight-ahead jazz improvisation.</TE>
<TE>   The performance of Paris Combo, in other words, presented music
with the sort of engaging appeal that bypassed any need for
definition or category. This, when you get right down to it, is what
all music should--and too often doesn't--have to offer.</TE>

<HD>'Ulysses S. Grant' Hails a Complex Chief</HD>
<DH>'American Experience' goes into depth in its portrayal of
the warrior and president as 'a reasonable man in an unreasonable
time.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOWARD ROSENBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If asked to name the most popular U.S. figure of the 19th century,
most Americans would probably answer Abraham Lincoln. Yet one after
another, experts in a fine new PBS documentary hand that distinction
to the man buried in Grant's tomb.</LD>
<LD>   The usual facile definition of Ulysses S. Grant as a gifted Civil
War general and inept president is transcended in this two-part
effort spanning four hours.</LD>
<LD>   He was neither unflawed as a warrior nor without strengths as a
peacetime leader, we learn from an account enhanced by striking
photos, savage political cartoons and reenactments as seamless and
well-produced as you'll find in historical documentaries.</LD>
<TE>   "Ulysses S. Grant," which begins Sunday, is another masterwork
from "American Experience," although it doesn't start quite that way,
as producer-director Adriana Bosch's necessary early attention to the
North-South conflict takes us to killing fields that are surely
familiar to even casual students of U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even here, the account of unrelenting battle is especially
powerful as well as poignant, following a trail of blood leading to
Appomattox, where tall, regal Robert E. Lee surrenders to his
shorter, mud-splattered adversary, as if their roles were reversed.</TE>
<TE>   Pictures of battles, from Vicksburg to Wilderness and Cold Harbor,
remind us again that anonymous dead lumps in the field link warfare
across centuries, even millenniums.</TE>
<TE>   And this portrait of Grant as a soldier who enjoyed war but
despised the slaughter rises far above the usual TV biography,
affirming him as a complex man of ironies and contradictions.</TE>
<TE>   But he is seen, above all, one of great character, his reputation
as a whiskey-head notwithstanding. He's recalled here as one of
history's tragic heroes, the skillful warrior who defeated the great
Lee in battle but was often overmatched by the generals of politics
and capitalism he encountered in eight years as president.</TE>
<TE>   The consensus here is that Grant was plenty tough, smart and
determined. But "sneakiness just wasn't on his radar screen," says
historian David Bradley.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. was already a speeding industrial engine--surely needing
a leader with different skills--when the reluctant Grant took the
presidency in 1869, much less decisively than his old colleague, Gen.
William Tecumseh Sherman, took Atlanta. "I'm afraid I'm elected,"
Grant informed his wife when the ballots were counted.</TE>
<TE>   Part 2, produced and directed by Elizabeth Deane, offers a
stronger sense of Grant as a man. Just picture this strong advocate
of Reconstruction being confounded by Southern die-hards who resist
black political power. When historian Donald L. Miller says the South
lost the war but "won the peace," he's speaking of an apartheid that
would endure perhaps another 90 years.</TE>
<TE>   After election to a second term, moreover, the cigar-smoking
president appears just as perplexed by crooks in his administration
who taint him with scandal, his despondency and the cancer in his
throat growing simultaneously.</TE>
<TE>   He spent his last days in financial ruin but still beloved, racing
against death to complete his memoirs. Historians here praise both
volumes and the intellect of their author. "He was a reasonable man
in an unreasonable time," one of them says.</TE>
<TE>   Grant was 63 when he died in 1885. The Union army's former
commander in chief was buried in a plain, dark suit, viewers are
told. He had sold his uniforms to pay his debts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "American Experience" will be shown Sunday night at 9 on KCET and
KVCR. Part 2 will be shown May 12. The network has rated it TV-PG
(may be unsuitable for young children).</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In the final minutes of the hypnotizing 1997 film "Dial
H-I-S-T-O-R-Y," by Belgian artist Johan Grimonprez, the soundtrack
fills with the seductive opening strains of Van McCoy's 1975 smash,
"The Hustle," which ushered in disco. On the screen, an Air France
jetliner glides into view from the distance, soaring over a pastoral
green landscape toward an airport runaway.</LD>
<LD>   Oooo-oo-oo-oo-oo! Do it!</LD>
<LD>   The jet fills the screen as it passes the camera, while the
background is transformed into a wavy blur of striated green, gold
and blue. The mechanical bird slides by, just above the tarmac.</LD>
<TE>   Oooo-oo-oo-oo-oo! Do it!</TE>
<TE>   The ship sails silently beyond the end of the runway, as if
straining for the release promised by the lush string orchestration
of the gently driving music, then clips the tree tops of a densely
wooded field before disappearing from view behind a sea of verdant
green leaves. After one breathless moment, the forest erupts into a
gargantuan ball of fire and black smoke. The music peaks--Do the
hustle!--and the credits roll. Five more planes crash in slow motion,
on land and in the sea, to the joyful disco beat.</TE>
<TE>   "Dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Y," currently being shown in the Project Room at
the Santa Monica Museum of Art, is a cinematic meditation on
international terrorism, in general, skyjacking, in particular, and
on the entertainment value of mammoth violence in a world driven by
mass media. In stark and trenchant contrast to today's simplistic
prattle about the struggle between good and evil, it refuses to see
the world in black and white terms. The final moments of hustle are
emblematic.</TE>
<TE>   Beautiful, horrifying, silly, seductive, painful to watch and
impossible to turn away from, the complex montage of found film,
video footage and sound assembled by Grimonprez creates a
kaleidoscopic tapestry. The global phenomenon of terrorist
skyjacking, which arose late in the 1960s and accelerated in the
1970s, is yoked to the simultaneous proliferation of mass-media
entertainment. If Washington is Hollywood for ugly people, skyjacking
is show business for the ugliest of politics.</TE>
<TE>   Grimonprez's 68-minute film was among the spare handful of bright
moments in the otherwise artistically arid 1997 edition of Documenta,
the sprawling international survey of contemporary art held every
five years in Kassel, Germany. (The next installment opens June 8.)
There, it was transferred to video and projected alone on the white
wall of a small gallery, like electronic wallpaper or an epic TV
mural. Crowds packed the room, mostly staring in stunned silence.</TE>
<TE>   At the Santa Monica Museum, Grimonprez has reconfigured the
presentation. The Project Room has been turned into a cross between a
public lounge and a suburban den. Bean-bag chairs are clustered
around big Sony television sets. Low, oval tables are painted bright
orange, while cobalt blue curtains cover one wall. A coffee maker
percolates nearby.</TE>
<TE>   It's a period room--the period roughly coinciding with the 1960s
ubiquity of both terrorist skyjacking and mass media. And because a
lot of current design nostalgically recalls that sleek, pop,
futuristic style, the period the room evokes oscillates between
present and past.</TE>
<TE>   The events of Sept. 11 are never declared outright, but they're
inescapably evoked. We watch the politically driven spectacle of
monumental airplane disasters on TV, as we did the destruction of the
World Trade Center. Grimonprez, a Belgian artist based in New York,
calls the room an in-flight video lounge--and indeed, the
disorienting feeling is of being permanently suspended between points
of departure and arrival.</TE>
<TE>   A shelf at one side features a diverse array of more than 40
videos that can be popped into the VCR. In addition to "Dial
H-I-S-T-O-R-Y," they range from glossy Hollywood fare like "Air Force
One," "Airport" and "The Wizard of Oz" to straight documentaries on
travel, tourism and politics. The 1957 "I Love Lucy" episode in which
Superman (George Reeves) saves the redhead from the ledge of a
building is there, along with the 1975 cinematic adaptation of
"Society of the Spectacle," the influential book by the brilliant,
autocratic theoretician Guy Debord, who was instrumental as a
catalyst for the 1968 student revolts in France.</TE>
<TE>   Also available for perusal is a copy of "Inflight," the artist's
slick magazine of arresting hijack stories. Promoted on the cover
beneath a grainy video image of airplanes being blown up at a desert
airstrip in Jordan. "What to do with a stolen Boeing 777."</TE>
<TE>   Grimonprez builds on a Pop art aesthetic. (Think of Andy Warhol's
1962 painting of a tabloid newspaper, whose blaring headline screams
"129 Die in Jet!"). He's a master at montage. "Dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Y"
opens with the first transatlantic hijacking, executed in 1969 by an
American Vietnam vet who commandeered a plane in Los Angeles and took
it to Rome. Soon Grimonprez brings in clips of early 20th century
film efforts to represent flying, as well as documentary footage of
early attempts to fly. The romance of flight gets enmeshed with the
growth of mediums of mass reproduction. Power and politics are
entangled in the mix.</TE>
<TE>   Both the failed flying machines from the turn of the century and
the grainy black-and-white film soon seem comical and
old-fashioned--not nearly so inspiring as the sleek video imagery and
spectacular explosions of today. Grimonprez induces such queasy
responses in a hapless viewer, who becomes the self-conscious gawker
at history's monstrous roadside pile-up.</TE>
<TE>   When he slips in a 1965 hijacking from Hungary to the West--a
daring freedom ride from behind the Iron Curtain--motive takes a
murky spin. Was that a good act of hijacking?</TE>
<TE>   And the Dallas psychologist who knowingly explains to a television
reporter that the airline whose flight attendants wear the shortest
skirts have been the target of a lopsided number of attacks gives a
freaky Freudian analysis of the motives of men with guns. Grimonprez
smartly follows with footage of Leila Khalid, the Palestinian woman
who, with different boyfriends, pulled off a TWA hijack in 1969 and
an El Al hijack in 1970. Freud wondered what women want, but to my
knowledge wrote nothing about terrorist politics as prime-time
entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Khalid was among a group of commandos who, on a Sunday afternoon
in 1970, snared four airplanes shortly after take-off from three
different European airports (Frankfurt, Zurich and Amsterdam) and
headed for the Middle East. Imagine! Four airplanes hijacked by
terrorists simultaneously. It would be unbelievable if we hadn't seen
it on TV.</TE>

<LD>Thanks to Dean Kuipers for his article "One Is the Loveliest Number"
(May 2). I often have to listen to comments from friends and family
who find it incredulous that I would choose to go a concert, a
restaurant or a drive in the desert on my own.</LD>
<LD>   The more I'm interested in an event (particularly live music), the
less likely I am to have someone tag along. Frankly, if I go to hear
great music, I want to focus on the music and not on the person I'm
with making a sour puss about not being the center of my attention. I
consider such lone excursions to be vital for my sanity.</LD>

<TE>   Thank you so much for Dean Kuipers's essay. It validates what I
pleasantly discovered when I moved here from New York City five years
ago after 25 years on Wall Street and Park Avenue: This is a land of
privacy and personal inquiry, not a place of needless opinions,
useless serpentine conversations and immediacy without much intimacy.</TE>
<TE>   I was so glad not to have to know or meet people, or be aware of
insistent industries such as Hollywood, and found my haven in Pacific
Palisades.</TE>
<TE>   As Dean says, I can dine alone, write alone, garden alone and
explore the splendid natural world alone in this incomparable Nation
State.</TE>

<LD>Baited into the "silly, sexist" "The Bachelor" by her "highly evolved
female friends," Mimi Avins is disappointed when a meeting with one
of the actor's parents appears to have been altered by editing
("Charmed Silly," April 27).</LD>
<LD>   Guess what? This is not real, it's just a television program.
There is another word for reality TV: oxymoron. Reality is what
happens to other people while you are busy watching the tube.</LD>

<TE>   I hope every Southern Californian girl and young woman watched
"The Bachelor," saw the pictures of Amanda Marsh and read the
article. What a beautiful and attractive woman she is. Alex Michel
thought so too, as he picked Amanda as his "Miss Right."</TE>
<TE>   More and more woman of our generation need the assurance that you
don't have to be a bag of skin and bones to be desirable and loved.</TE>
<TE>   I have never understood why the women of show business allow
themselves to be de-womanized into skinny, bony skeletons, at great
risk to their physical and mental health. Why the show business
executives think skinny women are sexy is a mystery. Obviously, Alex
and I think otherwise.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I admit I didn't watch the show, so I don't know about all the
players. But judging from the photos in the article, Mr.
Harvard/Stanford picked the woman out of the crowd just like the
punch line in the very old joke: He chose the one with the large
breasts.</TE>
<TE>   Unbelievable! Why do Americans watch this nonsense?</TE>
<TE>   DEAN CHANTILES</TE>
<TE>   Palm Springs</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Since Alex Michel chose the least interesting and least attractive
of the three finalists, I have a theory: Alex knew that Amanda would
be the easiest of the three to dump, if and when he chooses not to
marry. Shannon was too dignified and elegant. Trista was too intense.</TE>
<TE>   Personally, I think Harvard should ask Alex to return his diploma!</TE>

<TE>   Kevin Thomas referring to "Life or Something Like It" as "retro"
("Careering Into Romance," April 26) is about as funny as calling
"The Bachelor" progressive. Maybe that's why "The Bachelor" was a
hit, and "Life" won't be.</TE>
<TE>   In "Life or Something Like It," our heroine, played by Angelina
Jolie, abandons her dream of becoming a network anchor once she
becomes one and realizes what she'd have to give up to keep the job.
Hardly retro--perhaps New Age smart.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the 25 women on "The Bachelor" willing to give their
lives over to a man--a complete stranger, no less--for the true
measure of their success, smacks of the worst kind of "Donna Reed,"
I-am-not-worthy-unless-a-man-loves-me retro trash bins that women
still can't seem to climb out of.</TE>
<TE>   NANCY ROSENBLUM</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Steve Young's take on the reality TV series "The Bachelor" ("A Few
Real-Life Shows to Rival 'Bachelor,'" April 29) was so funny my side
hurt from laughing. I'm one of those blessed few who didn't find out
about the show until it was too late. And thank God I didn't! The
"reality TV" trend is disgusting enough without having to watch some
lucky schmo get what I've deserved for years ... or so I think.</TE>

<LD>Your article about Spider-Man's co-creator, Steve Ditko, a truly
remarkable comic book writer-artist, was one of the best researched,
most thoughtful articles I've ever read ("Spider-Man's Long-Lost
Parent," by Jordan Raphael, April 29). Even more amazing is the fact
that, although I've been a fan of Ditko's work for 35 years, this is
the first time I've ever seen a clear photograph of him.</LD>
<LD>   If you had published a close-up photo of the Loch Ness Monster or
the Abominable Snowman, I doubt I would have been any more bowled
over.</LD>

<LD>I agree wholeheartedly with Howard Rosenberg's comments on
self-congratulatory TV retrospectives ("Drowning in Self-Serving
Toasts," May 3). And I think I can answer his question, "What is the
big deal?"</LD>
<LD>   The "big deal" is the desperate need to defend the public taste
for mediocrity. For decades now, every social, educational and
especially artistic effort in popular culture has been ruled by the
same unspoken consensus: Excellence is too hard. It takes too much
thought, time and trouble. It is measured against absolutes, which
everyone knows don't exist. Let's create mediocre stuff and call it
excellent! Of course, in our hearts we recognize these efforts as
bogus. To still that little voice that tells us "This is garbage," we
must come up with ever greater and emptier accolades.</LD>

<LD>The L.A. Philharmonic's attempt to interest new audiences with its
Casual Friday program ("Classical and Casual Fridays," by Adam
Bregman, May 2), along with such events as children's concerts, are
merely Band-Aids treating the symptoms rather than the cause.</LD>
<LD>   The dwindling of audiences for serious music can be traced to the
fact that there is no music curriculum in the public schools.
Sensitivity to music can best be developed in the early grades. This
awareness of the aesthetics of music, followed up by a structured
music appreciation curriculum, would eventually bring audiences back
to the concert halls.</LD>
<LD>   Organizations such as the L.A. Philharmonic should spend their
resources on revitalizing music in the public schools rather than on
Band-Aid events.</LD>

<LD>The review by Paul Brownfield of "The Full Monty" ("They're Disrobing
and Disarming," April 26) was mean-spirited and seemed to give any
praise with great reluctance.</LD>
<LD>   I thought that this was the most entertaining production I have
seen recently. The audience was laughing and shouting and fully
involved with the actors. What more could one ask of any evening in
the theater?</LD>

<TE>   Paul Brownfield's review of "The Full Monty" was dismayingly and
disturbingly generous, and I almost gagged when he declared that,
despite its faults, it was "nevertheless difficult to resist in the
end."</TE>
<TE>   Please! Except for the Pavlovian shrieks that swept the Ahmanson
whenever any of the male characters stripped, I found the response to
the songs rarely more than polite, although even that was more than
they deserved.</TE>

<HD>Yesterday, When Cable Seemed So Far Away</HD>
<DH>Television* Former NBC executives look back to the days
when the decisions, and the profits, were relatively easy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a television season in which a series starring Sally Field as a
Supreme Court justice, "The Court," was canceled after three
episodes, former NBC President Herb Schlosser's recollection about
1969--when Field was playing "The Flying Nun"--provides a pretty good
sense of the one-way flight that television has taken.</LD>
<LD>   That year, he said, NBC went through the season without making a
scheduling change--not in January, when it's become expected that
networks shake up their lineups, or March, when viewers are deluged
with spring series tryouts.</LD>
<LD>   "Program changes were far less frequent," Schlosser said. "It was
a more leisurely pace."</LD>
<TE>   How much more leisurely? Demographic breakdowns of the previous
night's ratings, today pored over in minute detail as soon as the sun
rises, weren't available for two weeks. Programming executives, whose
comings and goings provide grist not only for newspapers but also for
modern TV outlets like E! Entertainment and "Access Hollywood,"
seldom saw their names in print.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of a frenzied schedule-setting process each May, when new
series are evaluated and chosen, CBS would announce its lineup on
Washington's birthday, in February. As a courtesy, the handful of
network executives who had a say in setting the schedule visited each
studio to screen its prototypes, as opposed to holing up to watch in
their headquarters surrounded by dozens of employees, as they have
been doing this week.</TE>
<TE>   Given the emphasis on nostalgia during the current rating sweeps,
it was inevitable that TV executives would indulge in their own trip
down memory lane. So it was that NBC, as part of 75th anniversary
festivities that include a prime-time special Sunday, assembled a
panel from its past and present to reminisce about the network's
history.</TE>
<TE>   Before that event, held Wednesday at the Academy of Television
Arts &amp; Sciences, those executives met at NBC to discuss television,
then and now.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, those who have left the network sounded a bit
like a character from "Gigi," expressing relief that they were no
longer part of the fray.</TE>
<TE>   Before the 1980s, said former NBC chairman Grant Tinker, "NBC was
always a profitable second, and RCA was happy with it.... You didn't
yank programs because it was a profitable business. There wasn't that
pressure."</TE>
<TE>   The executive suite, once shrouded in mystery, has since become a
fishbowl. "The media coverage now is enormous, so executives are
judged more rapidly," noted Schlosser, a senior advisor at Salomon
Smith Barney in New York whose legacy includes launching "Laugh-In"
and "Saturday Night Live." "The media isn't judging just the
programming. They're judging them."</TE>
<TE>   The television business was "much more fun," said Tinker. "It was
such a breeze to do what we did with three networks getting 90% of
the audience every night. It was a no-lose.... I wouldn't want to do
what these guys do for anything."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Tinker famously set a tone in the 1980s that put the
focus on quality--sticking with shows such as "Cheers" and "Hill
Street Blues," which gradually blossomed into hits. In what might
sound like heresy at a time when executives rely heavily on
focus-group data, Tinker urged his proteges "not to let the research
run the schedule ... and dictate what you put on." Former NBC
Entertainment President Warren Littlefield, who worked for Tinker and
Brandon Tartikoff, recalled Tinker's advising them, "First be best,
then be first."</TE>
<TE>   Littlefield and Don Ohlmeyer, who was NBC's West Coast president
from 1993 to 1999 but opted to skip the anniversary event, point to
the early 1990s as a seminal period for network television. As Fox
became a legitimate force and cable channels rapidly proliferated,
networks suddenly found themselves questioning where they fit in the
TV landscape.</TE>
<TE>   "What had traditionally been the strength of a network, which was
the breadth and strength of what it brought to the course of a day
... was more and more becoming a weakness, in that a viewer didn't
know what he was going to get when he tuned in," Ohlmeyer said,
contrasting that to more specific news or sports channels such as CNN
or ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   According to Littlefield, by the time he became president in 1990,
the major networks were no longer automatically profitable and were
grappling with redefining their role in a cable-wired world. "It was
no longer about serving everyone.... I thought that was really a sea
change," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, in recent years cable channels have exhibited the
ability to launch programs that can become media sensations, from
HBO's "The Sopranos" to MTV's "The Osbournes."</TE>
<TE>   "It puts a lot of pressure on us," current NBC Entertainment
President Jeff Zucker acknowledged. "It's particularly intense
today.... We judge programs after one airing, and everybody writes
about the week-to-week falloff after the first week, so it's no
surprise that we're getting judged on how we're doing six months into
our tenure."</TE>
<TE>   NBC Chairman Bob Wright, who has overseen the network since
General Electric acquired it in 1986, maintains that broadcasting
will have to become more community-based in the years ahead--offering
live and local programming that isn't available elsewhere--to combat
newer technologies and the fact that the average home receives
roughly 90 channels.</TE>
<TE>   Yet despite those competitive forces, Robert Mulholland, an NBC
president from 1976 to 1984, pointed out that doom-and-gloom
predictions began during his watch and that broadcasters will
continue to adapt and endure. "People have been predicting the death
of the broadcast networks ever since HBO went on the air," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Listening to their predecessors discuss canceling shows with
audience shares that would rank as today's highest-rated
programs--among them the original "Star Trek," which NBC dropped in
the 1960s--NBC's current crop of executives sounded a bit wistful.</TE>
<TE>   "We are ready to do a pilot called 'The Good Old Days' any time
you're ready," Schlosser said.</TE>
<TE>   Most agreed, however, that at least one aspect of television
remains unchanged. "It's still a hit-driven business," Littlefield
said, "and they're still out there to be had."</TE>

<LD>   Broadway Critics Assess New 'Producers' Stars</LD>
<LD>   So, after all the hoopla about replacing Nathan Lane and Matthew
Broderick in Broadway's smash hit "The Producers," how good is the
new cast?</LD>
<TE>   Lane's role, the morally ambiguous producer Max Bialystock, is now
played by Brad Oscar, who previously played a Nazi playwright in the
show and was Lane's stand-in during the initial run. USA Today's
Elysa Gardner said Oscar "has risen to the occasion with his wry,
rueful persona and utter command of Borscht Belt-based comic timing."</TE>
<TE>   The New York Times' Ben Brantley and Variety's Charles Isherwood
were mixed in their reaction. Oscar "sings and dances with flair and
knows his way around a joke," Isherwood wrote, but he is "more pallid
and less lovable" than Lane.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Weber, a former star of TV's "Wings" who plays Bialystock's
geeky sidekick, Leo Bloom, has "a charmingly goofy presence,"
Isherwood said. But Brantley and Gardner were less impressed, with
the latter calling Weber's performance "relatively flat."</TE>
<TE>   'Music Man' Cast Now Wants to Go Union</TE>
<TE>   Actors' Equity has filed a petition with the National Labor
Relations Board on behalf of the cast of "The Music Man," currently
at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, after "a substantial
majority" of cast members signed cards requesting Equity
representation, according to union officials.</TE>
<TE>   The NLRB has scheduled a hearing for May 13 in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The touring "Music Man" has been the subject of Equity protests at
12 previous stops because of its cast's non-Equity status. The union
suspended protests when the show opened Tuesday in Costa Mesa because
of the ongoing campaign to persuade the cast members to sign the
cards that were required for the NLRB petition. But since the tour's
band is also nonunion, the musicians' union did distribute leaflets
at the opening.</TE>
<TE>   The production is the first national tour based on the recent
Broadway revival of "The Music Man," and first national tours
traditionally use union talent. The show's producer, Dan Sher, could
not be reached for comment Friday.</TE>
<TE>   'Spider-Man' Being Readied for Stage Too</TE>
<TE>   For those who can't get enough of "Spider-Man," the movie, there's
a Spider-Man play on the way. The Marvel Comics superhero is due to
make his theatrical debut this fall in "Spider-Man Live," in a
40-city tour of the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The production, which is expected to coincide with the video
release of the movie, is scheduled to launch in Las Vegas in October,
with a possible earlier date at New York's Radio City Music Hall, USA
Today reports.</TE>
<TE>   POP/ROCK</TE>
<TE>   Rolling Stones Ready to Announce Tour</TE>
<TE>   The Rolling Stones have called a press conference in New York for
Tuesday to announce U.S. dates for the group's 40th anniversary
concert tour.</TE>
<TE>   It's expected the tour will start in late summer or early fall,
probably on the East Coast. The shows will add a major boost to a
year already heavy with superstar '60s and '70s rockers on the road,
including Paul McCartney, Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young and the
Eagles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great news," says Gary Bongiovanni, editor of the concert
industry-tracking publication Pollstar. "They're the reigning champs
of the concert business. Any year they tour it's a great year."</TE>
<TE>   The Stones' 1994 tour grossed $121.2 million, the highest-grossing
rock concert tour ever, according to Pollstar. "The expectation is
that they'll be doing indoor arenas--that's what we heard some time
ago," Bongiovanni said. "They'll probably follow the model they used
the last time, which was playing indoors and keeping ticket prices
high. You can have higher ticket sales at stadiums, but the overhead
can eat you alive. The Stones will be grossing stadium-level money
working indoors with a fraction of the overhead."</TE>
<TE>   Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and company plan to literally drop in
on Tuesday's New York City press conference, arriving by blimp.</TE>
<TE>   TELEVISION</TE>
<TE>   '7th Heaven' Paying Respects to Soldiers</TE>
<TE>   Marine Staff Sgt. Dwight J. Morgan, a 24-year-old helicopter
mechanic killed in a crash in Afghanistan, will be portrayed in
Monday's episode of "7th Heaven" on the WB.</TE>
<TE>   Series creator Brenda Hampton thought that highlighting the
real-life details of one of the more than three dozen military
personnel who have died in the U.S.-led fight against terrorism would
put a personal face on the loss for viewers.</TE>
<TE>   "Those people who have volunteered to go over and who volunteer in
our armed services ... , sometimes their deaths don't seem real. They
become merely news reports that we hear in passing," Hampton said. "I
randomly chose one person and decided it would be better to honor one
then none."</TE>
<TE>   In the TV drama, a member of the family, Ruthie Camden (Mackenzie
Rosman), becomes acquainted with Morgan through an e-mail
correspondence school project. The rest of the family gets to know
him through letters and photos, then must deal with news of his
death. The names of other American personnel killed in Operation
Enduring Freedom will be scrolled on screen at the end of the
episode.</TE>
<TE>   A Big Dose of 'Reality' on Fox This Summer</TE>
<TE>   Television's infatuation with unscripted series continues. Fox
says it has three planned for summer, starting May 23 with yet
another dating show: "I Want a Husband: Alaska."</TE>
<TE>   In that series, five women said to be in quest of mates will go to
Alaska, where Fox said it will supply "dozens of rugged and handsome
Alaskan men" for them to date and "narrow down their search for 'Mr.
Right.'"</TE>
<TE>   On June 11, Fox will introduce "American Idol: The Search for a
Superstar," a contest among singing hopefuls in which viewers have a
vote in who advances toward the prize of a recording contract. Also
planned for a date not yet determined: "Celebrity Bootcamp," with
contestants undergoing military-type training.</TE>
<TE>   Fox also plans to launch a newsmagazine this summer but didn't
offer any details about it, other than it would be produced for the
broadcast network by cable's Fox News Channel.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Hopkins, 64, and his wife, Jenny, have divorced after 29
years of marriage.... Winona Ryder will be poking fun at her recent
arrest on shoplifting charges in the next issue of W magazine,

O'Keeffe landscape "The Road Past the View II"--valued at
$950,000--is going on sale. Medicine Man Gallery is showing it at the
Los Angeles Antiques Show, held at Barker Hanger in Santa Monica
Airport this weekend.... The Kronos Quartet, which postponed a May 31
performance at UCLA's Royce Hall, is rescheduling it for Sept. 13.
The program will remain the same.... Matthew Broderick, Victor Garber
and Kristin Chenoweth are set to star in a TV remake of "The Music
Man," airing on ABC's "Wonderful World of Disney" next season,

<LD>More than any other artist, Andy Warhol blurred the lines between art
and commerce. Best known as a Pop painter of Campbell's soup cans and
celebrity portraits--Liz, Mao, Marilyn, Elvis, Jackie--he reveled in
popular culture, shopped up a storm and palled around with the rich
and famous. At his death, in 1987, he left a huge body of work that
captures the spirit of a relentlessly consumerist, star-struck
society.</LD>
<LD>   But even the artist probably would be amazed to see the marketing
blitz for the "Andy Warhol Retrospective," which will open May 25 at
the Museum of Contemporary Art. For the first time, this museum has
teamed up with city government, the Los Angeles Convention and
Visitors Bureau, corporate sponsors and private donors to try to
produce a blockbuster.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning Monday, banners and billboards advertising the show will
go up all over town, and they are only the most visible aspect of a
sales pitch that includes hotel packages, poster giveaways and
contests offering free trips to L.A.</LD>
<TE>   "Much of our stock in trade is--and should be--artists that
relatively few people have heard of," said Jeremy Strick, MOCA's
director. "That's what a contemporary art museum does. But Warhol is
famous, an icon, so we can work with this exhibition in a way that is
pretty unusual in the field of contemporary art."</TE>
<TE>   The participation of the convention and visitors bureau, a private
nonprofit association that markets L.A. as a travel destination, is a
key aspect of the plan. Building on its success with "Van Gogh's Van
Goghs: Masterpieces From the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam" at the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art in 1999, the bureau has committed more
than $850,000 to a national advertising campaign for "Warhol," in
partnership with American Express. The goal is to boost L.A.
tourism--still recovering from its post-Sept. 11 plunge--the economy
and MOCA's audience and financial resources, said Robert Barrett, the
bureau's vice president of domestic marketing.</TE>
<TE>   The bureau's support--along with an unprecedented $250,000
donation to MOCA from the city--also has helped to attract corporate
sponsors, whose names appear on ads for the show and who will host
private viewings for their employees and clients. Merrill Lynch
signed on as the principal sponsor; Angeleno magazine and Jaguar are
subsidiary supporters.</TE>
<TE>   The amount of their contributions has not been revealed, but that
support, combined with the city's donation and more than $1 million
from private sources, will pay all costs of the exhibition, which has
a budget of about $2 million, said Paul Johnson, director of
development at MOCA. Proceeds from admissions (which, for adults,
will be doubled or more over the regular fees) and sales in MOCA's
shop will make money for the museum, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition--a 50-year overview of the artist's work
encompassing little-known drawings and prints as well as iconic Pop
paintings--is the first major Warhol survey in America since 1989,
when the Museum of Modern Art in New York organized a retrospective.
The current show opened last fall at the Neue Nationalgalerie in
Berlin and wasn't intended to travel. But when the Tate Gallery in
London managed to book it for February and March, MOCA officials
launched an all-out effort to extend the tour to Los Angeles, the
final stop and the only American venue.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an extraordinary opportunity, art historically," Strick
said. Given the escalating value of Warhol's work and the difficulty
of persuading owners to lend pieces from their collections, there
isn't likely to be a similar show any time soon, he said. "If the
works went home, they weren't going to come back, so we had to act
very quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Presenting the show is "a very expensive proposition," Strick
said. MOCA is responsible for insuring, transporting and installing
the works, providing visitor services and publishing a new version of
the catalog to reflect substitutions and additions of artworks in the
Los Angeles presentation. The museum, which will extend its weekend
hours for "Warhol," also went to considerable trouble and expense to
fit the exhibition into its long-planned schedule. A show of H.C.
Westermann's sculpture and works on paper was moved from the
California Plaza facility to the Geffen Contemporary, and a show of
Juan Munoz's sculpture was postponed.</TE>
<TE>   "This has put an enormous strain on our staff and supporters,"
Strick said. "I think most institutions find that a steady diet of
blockbuster exhibitions is not a healthy thing; it's too rich. But
this is a unique opportunity that is really our duty to pursue as
aggressively as possible." Strick is planning for crowds (a tent will
be installed on the plaza to protect waiting visitors from the sun)
but hoping for impact: He'd like Warhol fans to spill over into the
museum's other exhibitions and return to MOCA once the Warhol show
closes.</TE>
<TE>   "We absolutely want as many people to know about the exhibition
and see it as possible," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Major exhibitions are usually planned three to five years in
advance, but for "Warhol" MOCA had six months, once the staff
determined that most of the artworks' owners would extend their
loans. "The next stumbling block was to quickly raise some money,"
Strick said. "We didn't know what the exact cost would be, but we had
to have funds in place." Within a few weeks, the museum received
contributions of more than $1 million from trustees and a few other
patrons, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Then MOCA board chairman Bob Tuttle and other trustees made calls
to garner the support of Mayor Jim Hahn and the Los Angeles
Convention and Visitors Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   The bureau's help, said Strick, "has made an incredible
difference." Its "Book a Room Get Tickets" campaign offers package
deals at 10 hotels from the Fairmont Miramar in Santa Monica to the
New Otani downtown. Ads in Vanity Fair, the New Yorker, Travel &amp;
Leisure and the New York Times, and an eight-page "travel planner" on
the Warhol show and other Los Angeles attractions, sent to 120,000
American Express cardholders, offer "two complimentary 'Andy Warhol
Retrospective' VIP tickets that allow you to go to the front of the
line, any day, any time" and an exhibition catalog to anyone who
reserves a room at one of the hotels and pays with an American
Express card.</TE>
<TE>   Among other bureau-sponsored promotions, the May issue of Travel
Holiday offers exhibition tickets and a trip for two to Los Angeles
as first prize and 100 Warhol posters as second prize in a contest
that celebrates the magazine's 101st birthday. Radio spots promoting
the television game show "Hollywood Squares" also feature a contest
with an L.A./Warhol trip for two, including airfare and hotel
accommodations, as the grand prize. All of the bounty is paid for by
a coalition of bureau partners, including American Express and the
hotels.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking for Merrill Lynch, Anita Contini said the company was
impressed by the exhibition and by the fact that the museum "very
smartly rallied a lot of support first through its own constituency,
its own board, and then the city and the convention and visitors
bureau" before seeking corporate funds.</TE>
<TE>   MOCA's venture into the world of blockbusters invites comparisons
with the Van Gogh extravaganza, which cost $10.6 million--more than
five times as much as the Warhol exhibition. "Van Gogh's Van Goghs"
brought 821,000 people to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art,
pushing its annual attendance from 554,000 during 1997-98 to 1.3
million during 1998-99, and pumped $122 million into the local
economy, according to an economic impact study prepared after the
show closed by Marey and Associates Inc., a Wyoming-based research
firm.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Kyser, chief economist of the Los Angeles Economic
Development Corp., has estimated that the Warhol retrospective will
have an even bigger economic impact on Los Angeles County--$130
million. But MOCA officials say that prediction may be overly
optimistic. Warhol is a giant of 20th century art, but Van Gogh is
probably the world's most popular artist. What's more, "Andy Warhol
Retrospective" will run for 12 weeks, the usual length of a major
exhibition but five weeks less than "Van Gogh's Van Goghs."</TE>
<TE>   "We are not planning on something of the scale of Van Gogh,"
Strick said. Even so, the Warhol show--which drew about 200,000
people to each of its earlier venues--is likely to set an attendance
record at MOCA. Its most popular exhibition to date, in terms of
average weekly attendance, is "David Hockney Retrospective:
Photoworks," which attracted 88,400 visitors over 13 weeks in 2001.
"At the End of the Century: One Hundred Years of Architecture"
brought 150,000 visitors in 2000, but it had an unusually long run of
23 weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Dated and timed tickets to "Andy Warhol Retrospective" went on
sale April 4 at Ticketmaster. The cost for adults is $12 on weekdays
and $17 on weekends (it's usually $6); for children 12 and under,
usually admitted free, the cost is $6 on weekdays and $8 on weekends.
The museum is also promoting sales of memberships, which include two
free tickets to the exhibition.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a great moment for us," said trustee Cliff Einstein, an
advertising executive whose firm, Dailey &amp; Associates, has produced
and donated the banners and billboards. "Museums are always wrestling
with how to promote themselves and attract new members. A show like
this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, so we pull out all the
stops. It's a chance to show off our institution and our wares."</TE>

<DH>Movies* 'Spider-Man' is swinging, and 'Clones' attacks May
16: Summer's here.</DH>

<LD>Can a Spider-Man take a bite out of a Jedi knight?</LD>
<LD>   The summer movie season kicked off Friday with the release of
"Spider-Man" on about 7,500 screens, and with it begins a
meticulously choreographed sprint to that most prized of Hollywood
trophies: box-office bragging rights.</LD>
<LD>   The Marvel comics superhero will be followed less than two weeks
later with the opening of "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the
Clones," and already the spinning has begun on which will have the
bigger opening weekend.</LD>
<TE>   Based on early tracking of the film, "Spider-Man" could take in as
much as $80 million at the box office this weekend--a huge, though
not record-breaking, opening. That would make Sony Pictures, which is
distributing "Spider-Man," king of the hill in Hollywood, at least
until "Attack of the Clones" opens May 16. The film opens on a
Thursday, giving its distributor, 20th Century Fox, an extra day to
bolster weekend box-office numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Though its place in the pop culture universe is firmly
established, this latest "Star Wars" episode may have the greater
marketing challenge, trying to overcome what some fans call its own
bad reputation from 1999's "Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace."
Bryan O'Donnell, a 26-year-old comic-book reader from Marina del Rey,
said he plans to read all the reviews he can get his hands on for
both films, but he will look at the "Star Wars" critiques a little
more closely.</TE>
<TE>   "I need assurance that that's going to be good before I rush out
and see it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That has resulted in a change of strategy by Lucasfilm--which
produces the "Star Wars" films--this time around. The company has
been trying to better control the hoopla (for example, fewer
licensees for "Clones"-related products) while getting the word out
through key sources that "Clones" is a better film than "Phantom
Menace."</TE>
<TE>   Internet movie guru Harry Knowles was leaked a copy of the movie,
apparently by a Lucasfilm insider in March. He says he was smuggled
into an Austin hotel room to see the completed film. Initially,
Lucasfilm representatives said they would investigate where the leak
came from, but after Knowles gave the film a glowing review, the
matter was dropped.</TE>
<TE>   "Before I saw the film, the buzz for 'Star Wars' was limp in a lot
of ways. There was not a 'gotta see it, gotta see it,'" said Knowles,
the founder of the fan-friendly Ain't It Cool News Web site. "You
could definitely tell ... that there was a governed sense of
trepidation in regards to the film. I remember being in theaters, and
while the trailers [for "Attack of the Clones"] are beautiful and
stunning, people were not letting themselves get excited. The
'Spiderman' [trailer] would get cheers and sort of an electric buzz
in the audience, while 'Star Wars' was sort of muted."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Ward, vice president of marketing for Lucasfilm, noted: "We
are more focused this time around. We have less tonnage--less
promotional partners, and we are targeting the kid audience."</TE>
<TE>   The All-Important Opening Weekend</TE>
<TE>   In today's box-office-obsessed atmosphere, the opening weekend is
crucial to a movie's success. A movie--especially in the crowded
summer season, when a potential blockbuster opens almost every
weekend--must break out of the gate fast; it's not unusual for big
summer films to take in a third of their total box office in the
opening weekend. For example, last summer "Planet of the Apes" took
in 38% of its total final gross its opening weekend--$68.5 million
out of a final total of $180 million, while "The Mummy Returns"
brought in 33.8% its first weekend, $68.2 million out of a
$202-million total, according to Paul Dergarabedian, head of
Exhibitor Relations Co., which tracks box-office grosses for the
studios. The domestic success of a movie often foreshadows its
overseas performance. This summer features such "franchise films" as
"Men in Black II" and "Austin Powers in Goldmember."</TE>
<TE>   Despite both studios' denials that their films are in competition,
"Spider-Man" and "Attack of the Clones" are kicking off the summer
season by going after the same demographic: young teen fans of comic
books and fantasy. Both films deal with characters who have become
cultural phenomena. Consumers can already find "Spider-Man" and
"Clones" games, fast-food tie-ins and toys such as a bungee-jumping
Spider-Man and a voice-activated R2D2 robot.</TE>
<TE>   "The same people who want to see 'Spider-Man' are the same ones
who can't wait to see 'Attack of the Clones,'" said Dergarabedian.
"Luckily for 'Spider-Man,' it will have two weeks without too much
competition."</TE>
<TE>   With an increasingly savvy moviegoing public watching Hollywood's
bottom line, judging winners and losers in the box-office sweepstakes
has become a popular pastime. Speculation has already begun on Web
sites about which of the early summer action fantasy films will be
the bigger hit, as in this comment posted on rottentomatoes.com: "The
way I look at it 'Spider-Man' has two weeks to make back its
budget--cause then it's all 'Clones' till summer! Good luck
Spidey--you're gonna need it!!!!"</TE>
<TE>   But "Spider-Man" has its loyalists too.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Liebowitz, owner of Golden Apple Comics on Melrose Avenue in
L.A., said, "There's definitely a buzz for 'Spider-Man.'" He knows of
people who reserved seats for the opening show days before the
movie's release, and he has helped librarians stock the city's
bookshelves with graphic novels featuring the superhero.</TE>
<TE>   The feeling, he said, is not the same for "Attack of the Clones."
After "Episode I," Liebowitz said, "There certainly was a real
feeling of disappointment and distrust. When you wait 10 years for
something, and it's the most important thing in your life, and then
you come out with Jar Jar Binks, you tend to be disappointed," he
said, referring to the "Episode I" character that garnered heat for
seeming to be a racist caricature. So, Liebowitz said, "There's a
little bit of selling to be done."</TE>
<TE>   Lucas Less Secretive With Episode II</TE>
<TE>   Sony and Lucasfilm are having to walk the fine line of generating
hype but not being caught short by the expectations they create. Even
"Star Wars" director George Lucas and fans of the series have
acknowledged "The Phantom Menace" was something of a disappointment
to fans, even though it was a box-office smash ($431 million in
domestic gross).</TE>
<TE>   Lucas now is keenly aware of the disappointment "Phantom Menace"
garnered among his fan base, as he told Time magazine in a recent
cover story interview and movie preview (which included allowing a
Time magazine writer to see an early print of the film). Guarding the
product has been a characteristic of Lucas, whose studio handles not
only the production of his films but also spearheads the marketing.</TE>
<TE>   With "Phantom Menace," the film was carefully kept under wraps
until the release date. But with "Attack of the Clones," reviews of
the film may start appearing more than a week before its release. In
a highly unusual move, a publicist representing Fox in Chicago sent
out an e-mail to all print media saying that "in a perfect world
Lucasfilm would love for opening-day reviews to wait as we know this
will never happen. Therefore I'm passing the OK to run them starting
the 8th."</TE>
<TE>   Ward said Lucasfilm had no knowledge of this e-mail and had not
been advised about it. Fox later said the e-mail was a mistake and
the film should be reviewed on its opening day, May 16. (Newspapers
generally honor studio embargoes against reviewing a film before it
is released. Because "Attack of the Clones" has already been reviewed
on a Web site and Time ran a partial review, it's not clear when
papers will run reviews of the film.)</TE>
<TE>   The "Spider-Man" campaign also has been carefully orchestrated.
One tactic: a double-edged approach introducing Spider-Man to a new
audience while sparking an older generation's memories of the
reluctant hero. Its marketing posters have been so well received they
have been stolen from locations around L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "They are now collectors' items," said Jack Feuer, who has written
about the topic as national news editor for Adweek.</TE>
<TE>   Sony and Lucasfilm seem to have learned some valuable lessons from
earlier overhyped campaigns like Disney's "Pearl Harbor" and Sony's
"Godzilla."</TE>
<TE>   "The industry--especially for those who are mounting major
tent-pole franchise movies--is being terribly cautious and not
over-promising," said Ken Markman, head of KKM Enterprises, a Los
Angeles-based strategic marketing consulting firm to the
entertainment industry. "In the consumer marketplace there was too
much product shipped at the wrong time, with very little retail being
sold with the last generation of 'Star Wars' and 'Godzilla.'
'Godzilla' is an archetypal example of what the industry wants to
avoid--over-expectation and under-delivery."</TE>

<DH>Kristen Smiarowski's provocative program addresses Mideast
conflict.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How do you dance at a time of overwhelming daily violence in the
Middle East? How do you make dances about that violence?</LD>
<LD>   In a provocative, uneven program titled "Because the Day Was
Sunny," choreographer Kristen Smiarowski explored strategies for
creative engagement Thursday at Highways Performance Space in Santa
Monica.</LD>
<LD>   Smiarowski's "Elegy" began as a conventional modern dance requiem:
Lillian Bitkoff, Marianne Kim and Carol McDowell sculpturally
mourning a la the Three Marys.</LD>
<TE>   Soon, however, the kind of sudden, random falls that Smiarowski
used all evening long shattered the pictorialism and emphasized the
process of accepting calamity and finding a way to get up again and
go on.</TE>
<TE>   In their duet "Turf," Smiarowski and Michele Bloom tried to
portray war as a series of confrontations over blocked access to
patches of green on the stage.</TE>
<TE>   But the result trivialized its subject and dancers. In her solo
"Bus (2000)," however, Smiarowski depicted just one victim in just
one terrorist bombing, reliving in her own body and consciousness the
moments before and after an incident that killed six people.</TE>
<TE>   Bracing against a chair, climbing on it, sinking in it, she
achieved a remarkable meditative identification with dying on a bus.
But the film that followed, "Beyond," by Smiarowski and Dmitry
Kmelnitsky, merely expanded the imagery of "Bus" in a formal coda of
spinning chairs, swirling clouds and headlines.</TE>
<TE>   Other spoken headlines punctuated "Attempts," in which Smiarowski
and Tom Young performed a postmodern movement cycle, repeated it
while describing grim milestones in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
and then silently performed it again with those milestones resonating
in everyone's minds at each step.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation compelled us to make a dance," they told us, and
even though they judged themselves to be merely "faking it," the
chilling result did represent, in their words, "a dance of death for
Israelis and Arabs."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kristen Smiarowski and Company perform tonight at 8:30, Highways
Performance Space, 1651 18th St., Santa Monica. $15. (310) 315-1459.</TE>

<HD>A Family Reunited in 'Little John'</HD>

<LD>Family ties can have a mysterious way of binding, even after being
broken. Judge Natalie Britain, an achiever haunted by a secret from
her past, learns that the hard way in "Little John," a Hallmark Hall
of Fame movie (Sunday, 9 p.m., CBS).</LD>
<LD>   As a family court judge in Los Angeles, Britain (Gloria Reuben)
routinely makes rulings affecting children and their families, but it
was a personal decision she made 12 years ago that has changed the
course of three particular lives, including her own. She always
assumed her unacknowledged child was adopted by strangers, but he
wasn't: Little John (Robert Bailey Jr.), as he came to be known, was
raised on a Texas farm by Natalie's father, John (Ving Rhames), from
whom Natalie has been estranged since her pregnancy caused a rift
between them.</LD>
<LD>   Now John, in failing health, takes the boy on a road trip to
California for a surprise reunion with Natalie, and Little John
reenters her well-ordered life.</LD>
<TE>   It's not exactly a Hallmark moment, at least at first: The driven
but detached Natalie is tepid to the idea of any kind of relationship
with Little John, and the boy reacts with righteous resentment.</TE>
<TE>   This well-crafted weeper, written by Temma Kramer and H. Haden
Yelin and directed by Dick Lowry, is elevated by a fine cast that
includes Patty Duke as Natalie's feisty, nurturing aide.</TE>
<TE>   Reuben, a former "ER" co-star, portrays the transition from hurt
to healing as a painful and thoroughly plausible struggle. As a man
with a chance to set things right, Rhames has a weary and soft-spoken
charm that is a far cry from his roles in "Pulp Fiction" and "Don
King: Only in America," and he has an easy rapport with young Bailey.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard not to root for these folks. After all, they're family.</TE>

<HD>Slum Village Revels in Wordplay; Afrika Bambaataa Meanders</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hip-hop's past and present converged at the El Rey Theatre on
Thursday, and the results were predictably erratic.</LD>
<LD>   The first act, Slum Village, is a Detroit trio that has
internalized all the lessons to be learned from its old De La Soul
and Jungle Brothers albums. The group's 2000 debut album, "The
Fantastic, Vol. 2," evoked the playful spirit of that '90s era of
enlightened rap without slavishly re-creating it. The group members,
who possessed the sly, unassuming mien of schoolyard pranksters,
worked the El Rey crowd as if they were trying to earn their B-boy
bona fides. They bumped and bounced words against each other and
finished each others' sentences, railed against lewd rappers and
celebrated their own skills. The band's new material, from its
forthcoming album, was equally invigorating.</LD>
<LD>   Afrika Bambaataa, the rap pioneer whose electro-funk record
"Planet Rock" is a touchstone hip-hop text, closed out the night with
a sluggish DJ set. Bambaataa seemed to be operating without a
compass, spinning old-school records in a desultory fashion while
veteran rapper Melle Mel tried to cheerlead, imploring the crowd to
give it up for the "legendary, unforgettable" Bambaataa. The DJ
didn't even attempt to foreground his own legacy--"Planet Rock" was
just another record thrown into the muddy mix.</LD>

<HD>Jobless Spike Rattles Markets</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Investors find more reason for worry, sending
blue chips and tech stocks lower. Weak growth in services sector also
drains confidence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A spike in the unemployment rate to the highest level in nearly eight
years gave investors yet another reason Friday to doubt the strength
of the economy and to unload stocks. Tech issues fell for the third
straight session, while blue chips broke a three-day winning streak.</LD>
<LD>   Friday's decline only worsened a slump that has dragged the Dow
Jones industrial average down 5.9% from its 2002 closing high of
10,635.25, reached March 19, while the Nasdaq composite index has
suffered a much steeper slide, falling 21.7% from its high close for
the year--2,059.38 back on Jan. 4.</LD>
<LD>   "We are in a bear market, particularly in the Nasdaq area of the
market. The excess we built up over many years is being taken out of
the market," said Mark Minervini, president of Quantech Research
Group. "Just like it went to extreme levels on the upside, it is
going to extreme levels on the downside."</LD>
<TE>   Nasdaq, a proxy for the troubled tech industry, fell 31.79 points,
or 1.9%, to 1,613.03--its 12th loss in the last 15 sessions. The Dow
slumped 85.24 points, or 0.8%, to 10,006.63, falling a day after
chalking up its first three-day winning streak since mid-March. The
broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index was down 11.13 points, or 1%, at
1,073.43.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the declines, it could have been worse. Nasdaq was down
almost 40 points early on and ended with losers outnumbering winners
by a slim 6-to-5 margin. The Dow rebounded from an early drop of
almost 150 points, with winners and losers about even on the New York
Stock Exchange by the closing bell. Volume was moderate.</TE>
<TE>   Nasdaq lost 3% for the week and has fallen seven of the last eight
weeks. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.3% for the week, and the Dow gained 1%.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street was disappointed by a weaker-than-expected
unemployment report for April. The nation's jobless rate jumped to 6%
in April from 5.7% in March--the highest level since August 1994. A
report that growth in the nation's services sector slowed in April
also rattled investors.</TE>
<TE>   Tech companies fell on a variety of indications that their
business slump will linger. A Merrill Lynch note to investors said
the profit outlook was still unclear for most semiconductor companies
and would continue to be through the second quarter. Losers among
chip makers included Texas Instruments, down $1.49 to $28.30, and
Intel, which fell $1.31 to $26.56.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle slipped 12 cents to $8.43 after Goldman Sachs and SG Cowen
reduced their outlooks on the software maker, whose shares are off
39% year to date. Microsoft, meanwhile, fell $1.65 to $49.56.</TE>
<TE>   Uncertain about earnings due next week from Cisco Systems,
investors bid the network equipment leader down 50 cents to $13.14.</TE>
<TE>   The tech sector has suffered the brunt of selling because it is
expected to be the last to recover from the recession. Another factor
in the tech sell-off has been the fact that investors ran those
stocks up the most in the last bull market, when companies including
Cisco were trading at 100 times their earnings.</TE>
<TE>   In other market news:</TE>
<TE>   * Blue chips fell as investors cashed in profits after the
three-session rally. Wal-Mart fell $1.40 to $55.25, Coca-Cola
declined 78 cents to $56.86, and GM stumbled 56 cents to $65.68.</TE>
<TE>   * Gold rose to its highest price in more than two years, gaining
$3.90 to $312.20 an ounce in New York trading as the jump in the
jobless rate rattled the already slumping dollar. The Amex index of
gold mining stocks rose 3.1%.</TE>
<TE>   * The Amex index of biotech stocks fell 1.5% to a new 52-week low.
It was led lower by the likes of Vertex Pharmaceuticals, down $1.03
to $18.19, and Amgen, off $1.52 to $48.80.</TE>
<TE>   * WorldCom was the most active Nasdaq stock and slumped 24 cents,
or 11.8%, to $1.79, on fears that problems at the No. 2 U.S.
long-distance telephone and data services company might intensify if
new management fails to quickly cut expenses, pare debt and stave off
a cash crunch.</TE>

<HD>Dollar Weakens on Jobless Report</HD>
<DH>Currency: Drop is welcomed by U.S. exporters, who have seen
their ability to compete with foreign rivals diminished.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The dollar on Friday suffered its biggest one-day drop against the
euro since January after a report showed a jump in the U.S. jobless
rate in April, fueling concern that an economic rebound may be slower
than projected.</LD>
<LD>   Demand for the currency also waned as the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index dropped to a six-month low this week on skepticism about the
strength of the U.S. expansion.</LD>
<LD>   "People's perceptions of the U.S. are not nearly as positive as
they were," said Jonathan Clark, vice chairman of FX Concepts Inc.
"The U.S. just isn't the place to invest that it used to be."</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. currency slid 1.6% to 91.73 cents per euro, from 90.32
Thursday, and reached its lowest level since Oct. 9. It sank to
126.97 yen from 127.94, reaching the lowest point in almost two
months. It was the dollar's fifth straight weekly loss against the
euro and the third against the yen.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar probably will drop to at least 94 cents per euro this
month, Clark said, which would be its weakest since February 2001.</TE>
<TE>   International investors exiting U.S. stocks and seeking a haven
amid continued tension in the Middle East are selling dollars for
European currencies, principally the Swiss franc, traders said.</TE>
<TE>   "You're seeing portfolio shifts out of the U.S. and into other
areas" by foreign investors, primarily toward Europe, said Peter
Gerhard, head of foreign exchange at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Some weakening in the dollar is welcome news to U.S. exporters,
who have complained that their competitiveness has diminished
relative to foreign rivals as the dollar has risen in recent years.
It's still up 23% against the euro since the 12-nation currency's
debut in 1999, making U.S.-produced goods more expensive in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar extended its declines Friday after a separate report
showed that an index of U.S. services, the biggest part of the
economy, fell in April.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts said the dollar is weakening because of concern U.S.
inflation will pick up this year. Higher energy prices--crude oil has
risen by about a third this year--are contributing to that concern,
as is the drop in the dollar, which raises the cost of imports, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Foreigners are reluctant to buy more [U.S. securities] in this
type of environment" because of concern their returns will be eroded,
said Harvinder Kalirai, senior strategist at State Street Corp. in
Boston.</TE>

<TE>   LIN TV Shares Rise 14%</TE>
<TE>   on First Day of Trading</TE>
<TE>   LIN TV Corp. shares rose 14% in their first day of trading after
the owner of 26 TV stations said it plans to more than quadruple the
number of stations it operates.</TE>
<TE>   The shares, trading under the ticker TVL, rose $3 to $25. Chief
Executive Gary Chapman expects a 7% rise in sales in the first
quarter and double digit revenue growth in the second, he said.</TE>
<TE>   LIN TV, controlled by buyout firm Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst Inc.,
also supplies sales and management services for four additional
stations. LIN's markets include Indianapolis, Buffalo, N.Y., and
Austin, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Chapman said he will disclose more details on the company's sales
forecasts when LIN TV reports first-quarter results May 14. It had
$271 million in sales in 2001, according to Bloomberg data.</TE>
<TE>   The company raised $374 million in an initial public offering. The
number of shares offered was increased to 17 million from the 14.6
million reported last month in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. The shares were priced at $22 each.</TE>
<TE>   The Providence, R.I.-based company said it plans to use proceeds
from the stock sale to repay debts of Sunrise Television Corp., which
is to be acquired in connection with the IPO.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, Irvine-based homebuilder Standard Pacific Corp.
(ticker symbol: SPF) said it is planning a 3.5-million-share stock
offering priced at $34 a share. Proceeds will be used to repay debt
and pay for recent acquisitions, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Standard Pacific's stock closed at $34.25, down 45 cents, on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<TE>   Dell Buys Back Shares</TE>
<TE>   at Higher Price</TE>
<TE>   Dell Computer Corp. (DELL), repurchased shares in fiscal 2002 for
an average price that was 74% higher than the market price, according
to a regulatory filing.</TE>
<TE>   The premium cost Dell about $1.27 billion during the year ended
Feb. 1, when the company's average share price was $25.38. Dell
shares fell $1.10 on Friday to $24.32 after the buyback cost was
reported by the New York Times.</TE>
<TE>   Dell uses its repurchase program to manage the dilution of share
value caused by employee stock options, spokesman T.R. Reid said.</TE>
<TE>   Dell executives have said they entered the contracts when the
firm's share price was rising, reaching a high of $56.43 in March
2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Austin, Texas-based company bought 68 million shares for $3
billion, or about $44.12 a share, in fiscal 2002, according to an
annual report filed this week.</TE>
<TE>   Dell has repurchased 940 million shares over a six-year period for
an aggregate cost of $9.8 billion, or an average price of $10.43, the
company said.</TE>

<HD>Former Fed Chairman Suspending Effort to Rescue, Revamp
Andersen</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Move by Paul Volcker follows infighting by
partners, lack of support for plan to create audit-only firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker said Friday that he
was suspending efforts to save accounting firm Arthur Andersen but
would continue to work toward industry reform.</LD>
<LD>   Volcker's efforts to rebuild Andersen as an audit-only practice
received only tepid support from the firm's partners, who have
instead largely focused on figuring out how to move with their
clients to rival companies.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen has negotiated as many as 40 deals to sell pieces of its
business to rivals. People familiar with Andersen's efforts to sell
portions of its business said these deals, crafted initially as
nonbinding agreements, will start to be converted into definitive
agreements next week.</LD>
<TE>   The major accounting firms are involved in the negotiations,
including the other members of the Big Five, KPMG, Deloitte &amp; Touche,
Ernst &amp; Young and PricewaterhouseCoopers.</TE>
<TE>   All of the deals are contingent on developing a mechanism that
would shield the buyers from Andersen's legal liabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, a federal judge denied a bid by retired Andersen
partners to stop the accounting firm from shedding partners and
employees, meaning the retirees will have to ask an arbitrator to
preserve their pensions.</TE>
<TE>   In Chicago, U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman threw out the
retirees' request for an injunction to stop what their lawyer called
the "fire sale" at Andersen, which the pensioners--numbering 500 to
700--said endangered their monthly payments that average about
$3,500.</TE>
<TE>   Tainted by its role as an advisor and auditor for energy firm
Enron Corp., the accounting firm has lost more than 300 clients in
recent months and is in danger of going out of business. On Friday,
it lost Marriott International Inc., Mentor Graphics Corp., Illinois
Tool Works Inc. and several other clients.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen tapped Volcker in early February to head a internal
oversight board to help overhaul the way the company operated as
criticism mounted over its work for Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Volcker issued a statement Friday that the board would continue to
look at reforms of the accounting industry but was in "suspension as
far as Andersen is concerned."</TE>
<TE>   The 74-year-old retired central bank chief offered to take control
of Andersen in March after the firm was indicted on a criminal
obstruction-of-justice charge for destroying documents sought in the
federal probe of Enron's accounting.</TE>
<TE>   But the bulk of Andersen's 1,700 partners failed to actively
support Volcker and his plan to transform the company into an
audit-oriented firm. Moreover, his efforts were hampered by fighting
within the firm.</TE>
<TE>   "It has become clear that there are many factions within Andersen
with different agendas trying to cut their own deals, but the
question of who in fact is ultimately approving all of these deals
has become quite cloudy," said accounting industry consultant Allan
Koltin.</TE>
<TE>   "It is beginning to appear that dominant partners with substantial
books of business can pretty well dictate what they want to see
happen with their practices or offices," Koltin said.</TE>
<TE>   This week, a court-appointed mediator declared an impasse in the
efforts to settle the civil litigation after Enron plaintiffs and
creditors failed to agree on how to split a $300-million offer from
Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   A last-ditch effort to bring the Justice Department back to the
negotiating table after weeks of fruitless discussions about a
deferred prosecution deal failed last week. The criminal trial is
scheduled to begin Monday in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen spokesman Patrick Dorton said the firm is moving ahead
with plans to create a smaller firm that focuses on auditing and tax
preparation work, but declined to comment on Volcker's action.</TE>
<TE>   Reuters was used in compiling this report.</TE>

<HD>Dollar Stores Buck the Grocery Sector</HD>
<DH>Retail: Despite low prices, the outlets reap higher profit
margins than markets and discount super-centers.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dollar stores, with their discontinued cereal and 99-cent toilet
cleaners, might not seem like much of a threat to supermarkets. But
as one of the fastest-growing segments of retailing, dollar stores
are quickly beginning to nickel-and-dime food retailers out of a
sizable chunk of business, analysts say.</LD>
<LD>   With lower-income families and retirees continuing to make up a
greater percentage of the population, there's never been more demand
for bargain havens such as 99 Cents Only Stores, Family Dollar Stores
Inc. and Big Lots Inc.'s Pic 'N' Save stores, analysts say.</LD>
<LD>   And as they're growing, they're gaining increasing clout with
manufacturers and access to better merchandise.</LD>
<TE>   Some packaged-goods companies such as Nestle are even beginning to
test-market special products or assortments geared toward low-income
families at these stores rather than at supermarkets.</TE>
<TE>   Despite rock-bottom prices, dollar stores also are reaping higher
profit margins than their grocery competitors or even operators of
discount super-centers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc., said Mark
Miller, an analyst with William Blair &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   "They may be 'ankle biters' to Wal-Mart Stores and most
supermarkets now," Miller said. "But over time in aggregate, they
pose a more significant challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Although growth in the supermarket industry slowed last year, the
number of new dollar stores almost tripled to 9,133 from the year
before, according to market research firm ACNielsen.</TE>
<TE>   And as the number of outlets has grown, so has their share of
sales of such products as cleaners, paper towels and napkins, pet
food, bread, snacks and drinks.</TE>
<TE>   The number of trips shoppers make each year to supermarkets
dropped to 75 last year from 85 just three years earlier, while trips
to dollar stores, super-centers and convenience stores edged up.</TE>
<TE>   "Supermarkets have been hit at both ends," said Asma Usmani, an
analyst with Edward Jones in St. Louis. The super-centers are drawing
away more high-income customers while the smaller dollar stores are
siphoning off lower-income customers, she said.</TE>
<TE>   To get shoppers coming in more often, many dollar stores are
setting up refrigerated cases and offering popular perishable items
such as frozen foods, milk, butter and eggs.</TE>
<TE>   The strategy has worked with Teddy Ong. The Los Angeles theater
stage manager and his wife go to supermarkets less oten these days.
They drop in at the 99 Cents Only store down the street from their
house whenever "we've got some free time" or need to pick up
something such as luncheon meat.</TE>
<TE>   "Ham is $2.99 in the supermarket," he said on a recent outing.
"Here, it is 99 cents and it's the same quality."</TE>
<TE>   Because stores such as 99 Cents Only are selling many of the same
branded goods as supermarkets, shoppers said it means little to them
where they buy it.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a good brand," said Bea Samorano, a campus police
officer, pointing to a box of Keebler Fudge Shop cookies. "And it's a
good deal. I come here for batteries and end up buying snacks too."</TE>
<TE>   The dollar stores' best customer is a woman with a household
income of $30,000 or less, in many cases a retiree or a mother with
small children.</TE>
<TE>   She makes twice as many trips to the dollar store as shoppers with
household incomes of $50,000 or more, according to ACNielsen.</TE>
<TE>   Because dollar stores in urban areas such as Los Angeles often are
wedged into strip malls within densely populated neighborhoods, they
may be more convenient than supermarkets or discount stores such as
Wal-Mart.</TE>
<TE>   And their smaller size--6,000 to 8,000 square feet on
average--makes them easier for older people to navigate than the
large stores of discounters such as Wal-Mart or Kmart Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "You can get in, grab items quickly and get out quickly," said Jim
Kelly, vice chairman of Charlotte, N.C.-based Family Dollar Stores.</TE>
<TE>   And increasingly, as these stores expand, consumers can get many
of the same brand-name items they would find at a supermarket--such
as Tide detergent and Stouffer's frozen meals--but with a lower
price.</TE>
<TE>   Some are close-outs, slow sellers or products that have gone
through a slight change in packaging.</TE>
<TE>   But in some cases, they are new items or items in new sizes vying
for the attention of the growing numbers of low-income shoppers.</TE>
<TE>   Nestle, for instance, is using Big Lots to test-market its
Friskies pet food for dogs in economy-size cans. Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co.
is selling packages of its Tape Twisters gum for kids, bundled up two
for 99 cents, at Big Lots.</TE>
<TE>   Food, health and beauty aids and cleaning products make up 30% of
the merchandise in Big Lots' 1,300 stores and are the hottest movers,
with sales rising 19% in March over the same time last year.</TE>
<TE>   Albert Bell, Big Lots' vice chairman, attributes it to a
back-to-basics mentality that gripped the nation in the political and
economic uncertainty of last year.</TE>
<TE>   But many dollar stores also have received an unexpected boost from
the struggles of Kmart.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing we noticed was additional availability of product
from manufacturers as a result of canceled ... orders by Kmart, but
we've also seen a nice improvement in our business," Bell said.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart counters that its shelves are 90% stocked, spokeswoman Julie
Fracker said. "We don't consider [dollar stores] a direct
competition," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Bell said business is so good that Big Lots is taking
the unusual step of launching a national advertising campaign after
it changes Pic 'N' Save and some of its other stores to the Big Lots
name in coming months. The company had been getting the word out
through fliers.</TE>
<TE>   Bell said much of the company's recent success is linked to
thinking like a supermarket and offering the food and cleaning aids
consumers need most.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what customers want," Bell said. "And we know that our
stores are more convenient than a giant grocery store or
super-center."</TE>
<TE>   Supermarket and discount super-center chains concede that dollar
stores are posing competitive challenges.</TE>
<TE>   Ralphs Grocery Co., which has a strong presence in California with
325 Ralphs stores and 111 Food4Less stores, said dollar stores
compete with Food4Less.</TE>
<TE>   "We offer higher quality, a better variety and more quality of
service," Ralphs spokesman Terry O'Neil said.</TE>
<TE>   "Overall, they're part of the nontraditional retailers entering
the grocery business."</TE>
<TE>   To counteract the loss of customers to discount stores, Ralphs
stores have added products such as small appliances and office,
gardening and kitchen supplies, O'Neil said.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart also is aware of competition from smaller discount
stores, especially in urban markets, said company spokesman Tom
Williams. But "we're aware of competition in all the markets we're
in. We do the same thing we do in all our stores: We compete with
price and service."</TE>

<HD>Edison Swings to Profit From Year-Ago Loss</HD>
<DH>Earnings: The company reports net income of $84 million in
the first quarter and raises its outlook for the year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Edison International, near bankruptcy a year ago because its Southern
California Edison utility couldn't pass high electricity costs on to
customers, Friday reported first-quarter net income of $84 million.</LD>
<LD>   The company earned 26 cents a share, contrasted with a net loss of
$617 million, or $1.89 a share, in the year-earlier period. Analysts
on average had expected earnings of 20 cents a share, according to
Thomson Financial/First Call.</LD>
<LD>   It was the second consecutive quarter of black ink for
Rosemead-based Edison International after four quarters of losses.
Results for the first quarter of last year included an after-tax
charge of $661 million, or $2.03 a share, for electricity debts that
Edison then considered unlikely to be recovered through customer
rates.</LD>
<TE>   Edison International posted sharply higher results for the latest
quarter at its Southern California Edison utility, offset slightly by
a wider loss at Edison Mission Energy, which builds and operates
power plants around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pleased to report that we are off to a good start this year,"
Edison Chief Executive John E. Bryson told analysts and investors in
a conference call. "For 2002, our focus is very clear. It is on
rebuilding and strengthening both our balance sheet and our
credit-worthiness."</TE>
<TE>   Edison International shares rose 16 cents to $18.41 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it expects to earn more money this year than it
previously predicted and is making progress in recovering from the
state's prolonged energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Edison's renewed health comes because, after two rate increases
last year and a plunge in electricity prices, the utility collects
more money from its 4.3 million customers than is needed to serve
them through Edison's own power plants and contracts and from power
purchased for Edison by the state.</TE>
<TE>   As part of a lawsuit settlement with the California Public
Utilities Commission, Edison is allowed to take that
difference--known as "headroom"--and apply it to a special regulatory
account to recover past power procurement costs.</TE>
<TE>   In early March, Southern California Edison secured $1.8 billion in
financing, which allowed it to repay most of its $5.5 billion in
electricity-related debts and other defaults. Edison was able to use
$500 million of headroom in the first quarter to pay down its debts.
It expects to have recovered all costs by the end of next year.</TE>
<TE>   "They're moving ahead now and putting the past behind them," said
Douglas Christopher, an analyst with Crowell, Weedon &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Edison Chief Financial Officer Ted Craver said the company expects
to earn at least $1.60 a share for the year, an increase from its
last earnings guidance, which projected $1.50 to $1.60.</TE>
<TE>   Craver cited the improved outlook for Southern California Edison,
which earned $146 million, or 45 cents a share, in the first quarter,
up from $63 million, or 19 cents, a year earlier. Last year's quarter
was hurt by a prolonged outage at one unit of the San Onofre nuclear
power plant as well as higher interest expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Edison Mission Energy posted a loss of $36 million, or 11 cents a
share, because of lower power prices and an outage at a Pittsburgh
power plant. In the first quarter last year, it recorded a loss of
$11 million, or 3 cents a share.</TE>

<HD>Enron Proposes to Spin Off New Firm</HD>
<DH>Energy: Proceeds from entity would be used to help repay
creditors. Executives hope to complete deal this year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Enron Corp. on Friday proposed a strategy for bundling the bulk of
its energy generating, exploration and pipeline businesses into a new
company that would be split from and run independently of the husk
now in Chapter 11 proceedings.</LD>
<LD>   Enron's interim chief executive, corporate turnaround specialist
Stephen F. Cooper, presented the plan to Enron's official committee
of unsecured creditors in a meeting in New York. Cooper said getting
the operating units out from under Enron's complicated bankruptcy
case would be the best way to maximize their value.</LD>
<LD>   Once the new company, for now to be called OpCo Energy Co., is
formed, it would be auctioned off. The proceeds--some combination of
cash, bonds or stock--would later be divided among the creditors in a
process to be overseen by U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.</LD>
<TE>   Enron hopes to complete the transaction by year's end. OpCo, which
would have operations in the U.S. and Central and South America,
would generate annual EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, of $1.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The goal of the plan is first to "preserve the pizza," then later
decide how to slice it up among the creditors, Cooper said in a
telephone news conference after the creditors meeting.</TE>
<TE>   It was one of several metaphors he used to describe the complex
proposal. A moment later, he said he wanted to "deliver a Clydesdale"
to creditors rather than have the assets shrink to the size of a
Shetland pony or a Chihuahua.</TE>
<TE>   The entire proposal requires the approval of creditors and the
Bankruptcy Court.</TE>
<TE>   OpCo stands for "Options Company," to convey the idea that
creditors would have an array of options under the plan, Cooper said.
He quickly acknowledged that it is "a weird name" and said a new one
would be chosen later.</TE>
<TE>   Luc Despins, chief lawyer for the creditors committee, did not
return telephone calls seeking comment on the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper said he did not foresee mass layoffs among the
approximately 20,000 employees who work for the companies that would
be bundled into OpCo, adding that in most cases, the workers would go
along with the companies whether they were merged with other firms or
operated as stand-alone entities.</TE>
<TE>   As for the 2,000-plus employees in Enron's trading unit, Enron
North America, it has been clear since the company filed its Chapter
11 petition Dec. 2 that they would eventually lose their jobs as the
company wound down its business, Cooper said.</TE>

<HD>Greenspan Repeats Call to Expense Stock Options</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The lucrative stock options that showered millions of dollars on top
corporate executives over the last decade should be treated as a
business expense even though that accounting change could
significantly reduce a corporation's reported profit, Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Greenspan, in remarks to a financial markets conference in Sea
Island, Ga., continued his campaign to get accounting regulators to
force a change in the way companies deal with options on their books.</LD>
<LD>   His proposal represents a rare break with the Bush administration,
which has sided with corporate executives in opposing the accounting
change.</LD>
<TE>   Greenspan's proposal is the major recommendation he has made in
response to the collapse of Enron Corp., whose top executives made
millions of dollars in profit by cashing in their stock options
before the company's stock collapsed, wiping out the retirement
benefits of thousands of the company's rank-and-file workers.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan said that under the current practice, which does not
require companies to reflect the true cost of options in their annual
reports, investors will continue to receive inaccurate information
about the financial status of a company.</TE>
<TE>   "The failure to expense stock option grants has introduced a
significant distortion in reported earnings and one that has grown
with the increasing prevalence of this form of compensation,"
Greenspan said.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan expanded on arguments he made in March that the current
practice of not counting stock options as a business expense was
inflating corporate profits and giving investors a false impression
of the true value of the company.</TE>
<TE>   The change would have a huge effect on U.S. companies.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Reserve has estimated that annual corporate earnings
growth between 1995 and 2000 was 2.5 percentage points higher for big
companies because they did not have to count options as expense
subtracting from their earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Stock options give employees the right to buy a company's stock in
the future at a predetermined price.</TE>
<TE>   The more the company's stock price rises, the more valuable the
stock option becomes.</TE>

<HD>Amgen Merger Spurs Immunex to Sell Leukine</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: Schering will pay $380 million for drug,
removing hurdle to pending acquisition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Immunex Corp. said Friday that Schering agreed to pay $380 million
for Leukine, a drug used to treat the side effects of chemotherapy.</LD>
<LD>   The deal clears a regulatory hurdle in the way of Amgen Inc.'s
pending acquisition of Immunex. Amgen has two drugs that are similar
to Leukine, and one of them, Neupogen, dominates the market.</LD>
<LD>   In a research note, Prudential Securities analyst John Sonnier
said the deal was a good one. But investors drove Amgen's shares down
to a 52-week low on a day when the market also fell.</LD>
<TE>   Fariba Ghodsian, an analyst with Roth Capital Partners in Los
Angeles, called the price tag for Leukine "a little light." She said
she expected an amount closer to $500 million, or about five times
Leukine's 2001 sales of $108 million.</TE>
<TE>   However, the strength of Amgen's products may have depressed the
price for Leukine, Ghodsian said.</TE>
<TE>   Neupogen had sales of $1.3 billion in 2001. Neulasta, a new,
longer-acting form of Neupogen, could have sales of $145 million this
year, according to J.P. Morgan Securities.</TE>
<TE>   Immunex said that, in addition to buying the drug, Schering will
lease the Immunex facilities in Seattle and Bothell, Wash., where the
drug is made, and hire an unspecified number of Immunex employees.
Schering agreed to pay Immunex an additional $90 million when it
files a marketing application for use of the drug in treating Crohn's
disease.</TE>
<TE>   The sale of Leukine to Schering, Germany's second-largest drug
company, must be cleared by the Federal Trade Commission. It also is
contingent on completion of Amgen's $16-billion acquisition of
Immunex. Amgen has said it expects to close the deal by the end of
June.</TE>
<TE>   On Nasdaq, Immunex shares closed at $25.21, down 50 cents, and
Amgen fell $1.52 to $48.80.</TE>

<HD>ABC Eyes Replacement for 'Politically Incorrect'</HD>
<DH>Television: Network is said to be in talks with Jimmy
Kimmel of 'The Man Show' in a bid for younger viewers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ABC is in discussions with comedian Jimmy Kimmel, co-host of Comedy
Central's "The Man Show," to serve as host of a program that would
replace its troubled late-night show "Politically Incorrect With Bill
Maher," according to several sources.</LD>
<LD>   It was not known what form a show with Kimmel as host would take,
but ABC, a unit of Walt Disney Co., has stated its desire to attract
younger viewers to late night. That was a primary motivation behind
the network's bid in March to woo David Letterman from CBS to a show
that would have displaced "Nightline."</LD>
<LD>   Kimmel would bring a niche following, particularly among men ages
18 to 34, a demographic popular with advertisers.</LD>
<TE>   After the failed bid for Letterman, ABC restated its commitment to
"Nightline" but remained noticeably silent on the future of
"Politically Incorrect." An ABC spokesman declined to comment on any
discussions with Kimmel, as did representatives for the comedian.</TE>
<TE>   It has been widely thought that ABC will replace "Politically
Incorrect," which airs weeknights at 12:05 a.m. The program's
contract expires at the end of the year. Sources said ABC might want
to have an announcement ready before unveiling next season's revised
prime-time lineup to advertisers May 14.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of discussion about Maher in the midst of the public
relations maelstrom that the Letterman negotiations kicked up further
hardened feelings between ABC and producers of the show, who believe
the network has done little to support it.</TE>
<TE>   Relations evidently have not recovered from Maher's reference on
the show to past U.S. military actions as cowardly. In the wake of
those remarks, made shortly after Sept. 11, several
advertisers--including Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. and FedEx Corp.--pulled
ads from the show, and some affiliates refused to air the program.</TE>
<TE>   Maher and his producers also have complained about a lack of
promotion, having had no success getting "Nightline" host Ted Koppel
to tease to their show before the news program signs off.</TE>
<TE>   "They have no clue how to nurture a late-night franchise, and I
wish Jimmy Kimmel the best of luck--he's going to need it," said Mark
Gurvitz, Maher's manager at Brillstein-Grey Entertainment, which
produces the show in association with HBO Downtown Productions.</TE>
<TE>   Maher declined to comment, although he has publicly acknowledged
the speculation that his show, which began as a Comedy Central series
in 1993 before moving to ABC in 1997, is on a short leash.</TE>
<TE>   If Kimmel were to land at ABC, his persona would provide an even
more discordant companion to "Nightline."</TE>
<TE>   "The Man Show" is a celebration of beer drinking, scantily clad
women and other male pursuits. It begins taping its fourth season
this month.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Kimmel is among the creators of Comedy Central's
"Crank Yankers," in which puppets give voice to prank phone calls;
the series will premiere next month.</TE>
<TE>   Kimmel also appeared on Fox Sports' coverage of professional
football.</TE>

<HD>Order to Track TV Recorder Criticized</HD>
<DH>Technology: Privacy groups, electronics industry say
monitoring how viewers use ReplayTV is spying.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Privacy advocates and electronics companies Friday blasted a federal
magistrate's order requiring the manufacturer of a new personal video
recorder to monitor and report everything viewers do with the
devices--from what they watch to which commercials they skip.</LD>
<LD>   The order by Magistrate Judge Charles F. Eick in Los Angeles is
unusual, and possibly unprecedented, in that it requires Sonicblue
Inc. to write and install new software to gather data about users of
the ReplayTV 4000. Sought by a group of Hollywood studios and TV
networks, Eick's order represents the latest front in a high-stakes
battle between technology companies and copyright holders over what
consumers can and cannot do with digital devices.</LD>
<LD>   David Martin, who follows personal video recorders for the Privacy
Foundation, said the order was "worse than just a privacy squabble."</LD>
<TE>   "Our courts have no business ordering a company to spy on its own
customers just because big media wants to put the company out of
business," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The case pits some of the world's largest media companies,
including AOL Time Warner Inc., Viacom Inc. and Walt Disney Co.,
against Sonicblue, a Santa Clara-based manufacturer of consumer
electronics. The studios and networks claim the ReplayTV 4000 has two
features that violate copyrights: It can send recorded programs to
other Replay units over the Internet, and it can skip commercials
automatically as it plays back recordings.</TE>
<TE>   Eick gave Sonicblue until the end of June to start gathering "all
available information about how users of the ReplayTV employ the
devices, including all available information about what works are
copied, stored, viewed with commercials omitted, or distributed to
[others], when each of those events took place, and the like." That
data must be turned over to the plaintiffs, along with any other
information about user behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of Viacom and Disney said they weren't trying to
spy on the public but simply sought to gather the data needed to
protect copyrighted programs. "We respect viewer privacy and the
order we obtained respects that important right," Disney said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   But officials at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the
Electronic Privacy Information Center, the Privacy Foundation and the
Consumer Electronics Assn. expressed outrage over the order, saying
it poses serious risks to the public. Sonicblue plans to appeal
Eick's order, and the EFF and EPIC plan to support the appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "The reasonable expectation [of users] is that we are not being
monitored in our television viewing by a court," said Megan Gray,
senior counsel for EPIC. Although the order calls for Sonicblue to
turn over the data with random numbers in place of viewers' names,
Gray said the anonymity could be lost later if the plaintiffs decided
to demand the names.</TE>
<TE>   Viacom spokesman Imara Jones stressed that the studios had no
interest in the identities of ReplayTV owners, but did need to see
"individual use patterns" to build their case. He also noted that
Sonicblue's privacy policy says the company collects anonymous data
from ReplayTV units about how the devices are used, although
Sonicblue representatives say they stopped collecting data long
before the new models hit the market.</TE>
<TE>   "This move is yet another example of Hollywood trying to use
copyright law to take control of the engineering decisions of
technology companies," said Fred von Lohmann, an attorney at the EFF.</TE>

<LD>A lawsuit claims that Sony Corp.'s Columbia Pictures is cheating
Walter Matthau's estate out of at least $1 million in profit from two
of the Oscar-winning actor's films.</LD>
<LD>   Matthau's heirs claim that Columbia underreports the license fees,
home video sales and other revenue from "Cactus Flower" and
"California Suite." The late actor had profit-participation
agreements with the studio for the films, the suit says. The fraud,
breach of contract and negligence suit seeks $1 million in
compensatory damages and unspecified punitive damages. Los
Angeles-based Columbia Pictures didn't immediately return a call for
comment.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Volkswagen said its net profit fell 24% in the first quarter compared
with a year ago, amid falling sales.</LD>
<LD>   Europe's largest auto maker earned $564 million in net profit,
down from $699 million the year before. That roughly matched analyst
estimates.</LD>
<LD>   Sales fell 5% to $19.2 billion. The company, which warned in March
that profit would fall this quarter, said an economic recovery in
Western Europe and the United States in the second half of the year
would enable it to fulfill its forecast that pretax earnings this
year would roughly equal last year's figure.</LD>

<LD>Restoration Hardware Inc. restated financial results for the last two
years, increasing the loss in fiscal 2000 and lowering the fiscal
2001 loss after changing how it accounts for furniture sales.</LD>
<LD>   The loss in the year ended Feb. 3, 2001, was revised to 22 cents
from 18 cents. The restatement reduced the loss for the year ended
Feb. 2, 2002, to $1.57 a share from $1.58.</LD>
<LD>   The company, which is audited by Deloitte &amp; Touche, now recognizes
sales when furniture is delivered to a customer rather than when it
is shipped. Restoration Hardware in March said it planned the
restatement after discussions with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.</LD>
<TE>   Stock of the Corte Madera, Calif.-based company fell 19 cents to
$11.50 on Nasdaq. The restatement was released after the markets
closed.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. plans to open more stores outside shopping malls
as it benefits from shedding unprofitable businesses, Chief Executive
Alan Lacy said.</LD>
<LD>   The largest U.S. department store chain is remodeling stores and
plans a new clothing line, and will open more stores as it boosts
profit, Lacy said.</LD>
<LD>   Expansion in malls is limited because fewer are being built.
Sears' mall-based stores face competition from such firms as Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. and Home Depot Inc.</LD>
<TE>   Sales at stores open at least a year have fallen in 10 of the last
11 months through March, and Sears has said it expects sales to
decline through the end of the year. Sears needs to add stores to
boost sales, investors have said.</TE>
<TE>   The Hoffman Estates, Ill.-based company is opening 15 stores this
year, of which almost half are replacing older ones.</TE>
<TE>   Sears shares fell 97 cents to close at $51.95 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>TRW Holds Out an Olive Branch</HD>
<DH>Aerospace: Chairman says deal with Northrop is still
possible. Suitor will decide this weekend whether to press bid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shareholders of TRW Inc. rejected a proposal that would have enabled
Northrop Grumman Corp. to buy a large stake in their company, but a
top TRW executive suggested that a deal still could be struck.</LD>
<LD>   In the first conciliatory gesture since Century City-based
Northrop launched its hostile $6.7-billion bid in late February, TRW
Chairman Philip A. Odeen said representatives of the companies met
Thursday night and that a friendly pact is still possible.</LD>
<LD>   "The meeting was very constructive regarding the confidentiality
agreement," Odeen said in an interview shortly after a special
meeting at the company's Cleveland headquarters.</LD>
<TE>   "The discussions are continuing and we believe we can arrive at a
mutually acceptable agreement."</TE>
<TE>   The remarks came shortly after TRW shareholders appeared to reject
a proposal that would have given Northrop a psychological edge in its
bid. The proposal, required under Ohio law, wasn't a direct vote on
the deal but would have allowed Northrop to acquire more than 20% of
TRW shares.</TE>
<TE>   If passed, the referendum would have put added pressure on TRW
executives to negotiate with Northrop, whose sweetened offer of $53 a
share has been rebuffed as "financially inadequate."</TE>
<TE>   The results were preliminary, and the finally tally isn't expected
for several more weeks, but Odeen said the proposal was rejected
"decisively."</TE>
<TE>   Northrop executives confirmed Thursday's meeting but declined to
respond to Odeen's remarks. They said the company would decide over
the weekend whether to extend its offer for TRW. The all-stock tender
offer officially expired Friday. "As our exchange offer is scheduled
to expire at midnight tonight, we will review our options over the
weekend and issue a release Monday morning," Northrop Chairman Kent
Kresa said in a statement Friday.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear what Northrop would decide, but sources close to
the company said there has been intense debate in the last week about
dropping the bid, apparently fueled by frustration that TRW has been
able to prevent Northrop from looking at the company's financial
details.</TE>
<TE>   Kresa has maintained that if Northrop could look at TRW's books,
he could raise the offer depending on "hidden values" discovered
during due diligence.</TE>
<TE>   But TRW has insisted that Northrop sign a so-called standstill
agreement, which would preclude Northrop from making another bid for
three years if talks collapsed. Northrop has proposed a 75-day
standstill. Neither side seemed to budge until Friday, when Odeen
said TRW was willing to negotiate the terms of the standstill
provision.</TE>
<TE>   Some Northrop executives are leery of TRW's publicly stated
willingness to give Northrop access to the books, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   James McAleese, a defense industry lawyer who is advising
Northrop, said the company may be running out of patience.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the straw that broke the camel's back," McAleese said of
the shareholder vote. "The ball now belongs in Northrop's court. They
can walk or talk."</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts speculated Friday that Odeen was extending an olive
branch to Northrop because TRW doesn't appear to have a rival bidder,
although several companies apparently are interested in acquiring its
aircraft parts business, one of three major operating units.</TE>
<TE>   In response to Northrop's bid, TRW said it was accelerating its
own breakup plan that includes selling the aeronautical parts
business, spinning off its automotive parts unit and then focusing on
its defense and space electronics operations.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop, the nation's third-largest defense contractor, wants
TRW's defense business, headquartered in Redondo Beach, and had
proposed a similar breakup plan if it was successful with the bid.</TE>
<TE>   "If they had one [a rival bidder], something would have happened
already," said Jon B. Kutler, president of Los Angeles-based
Quarterdeck Investment Partners Inc., a defense investment bank.</TE>
<TE>   As such, Kutler said, the shareholder vote was more of a
"psychological" setback than a substantive one for Northrop. "It
really doesn't preclude Northrop from still pursuing the company. It
just presents a different road map for Northrop."</TE>
<TE>   The stock market appeared to react with similar disinterest. In a
day of declines across the board, TRW shares fell 80 cents to $55
after climbing to a 52-week high earlier in the day, while Northrop
shares dipped $1.02 to $122.38 after reaching its 52-week high a day
earlier. Both trade on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft's Allen to Sell USA Stake</HD>
<DH>Deals: Sources say the billionaire is interested in buying
more cable systems, including Adelphia's L.A. assets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Billionaire Paul Allen has agreed to sell his 5.9% stake in USA
Networks Inc. for $568.7 million to raise money to buy cable systems
that include some in Los Angeles, according to regulatory filings and
sources close to the Microsoft  Corp. co-founder.</LD>
<LD>   Allen will sell 19.9 million shares of USA for $28.50 each in
private transactions that are expected to be completed by Tuesday,
according to the filings.</LD>
<LD>   Sources say the USA sale is part of Allen's strategy to gradually
liquidate his once-diverse portfolio of companies to focus on cable
and interactive television investments. Allen is a key financier of
the Hollywood studio DreamWorks and also controls Charter
Communications Inc., the nation's fourth-largest cable operator.</LD>
<TE>   "This really boils down to our focus on cable-related activities,"
said Michael Nank, a spokesman for Vulcan Ventures Northwest Inc.,
Allen's investment firm.</TE>
<TE>   Charter is a leading contender for Los Angeles systems that
Adelphia Communications Corp. plans to sell in the coming weeks to
reduce its debt in an effort to salvage the company, which is under
federal investigation for possible securities violations.</TE>
<TE>   Allen has nearly quadrupled his investment in USA since 1997, when
he sold the company his 49.6% stake in Ticketmaster and became a
major shareholder.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, USA shares were trading at $8. They closed Friday at
$30.05, up 70 cents on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   USA is close to completing the sale of its USA and Sci-Fi cable
channels to Vivendi Universal, becoming solely an electronic
retailer, and sources close to Allen said the billionaire preferred
putting his money back into Charter.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia is the largest cable operator in Southern California,
with about 800,000 subscribers in Los Angeles alone. Allen has
coveted these systems since 1999, when Charter lost to Adelphia in a
bidding war for their owner, Century Communications.</TE>
<TE>   Although Vulcan's offices are in Portland, Ore., Allen has been
eager to establish a home base in Los Angeles and is building a
mansion here.</TE>
<TE>   For Charter, which operates mostly in medium-sized and small
markets, a big-city system such as Los Angeles would improve its
standing in a fast-consolidating industry. Rivals such as Cox
Communications Inc. and Comcast Corp. own systems mainly in large
cities, where customers are more affluent and operating margins
generally are higher.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia operates some of the most desirable systems in Los
Angeles, including places such as Pacific Palisades, Brentwood,
Bel-Air, Manhattan Beach and Redondo Beach.</TE>
<TE>   A source close to Charter said Thursday that the Adelphia board
will begin reviewing its sales options with the company's advisors
this weekend and could begin a formal auction process in mid-May.
Adelphia is expected to sell systems that serve up to half of the
company's 6 million subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia could get $3 billion or more for the Los Angeles system.
Charter could face competition from rival cable operators including
AOL Time Warner Inc., which serves 500,000 subscribers in the region,
and investment groups such as the one formed by former Charter Chief
Executive Jerald Kent.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Debt Rating Cut to Just Above Junk Status</HD>
<DH>Media: Concerns over heavy borrowing and acquisitions
strategy cited. Move doesn't affect cash position, firm says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In another symbolic blow to Vivendi Universal Chief Executive
Jean-Marie Messier, Moody's Investors Service said Friday that it had
downgraded the long-term debt ratings of the French media giant amid
concerns about the company's debt level and Messier's
growth-by-acquisition strategy.</LD>
<LD>   Moody's lowered Vivendi's rating one level to Baa3 with a stable
outlook. The classification is Moody's lowest investment-grade
rating--one notch above "junk" status assigned to speculative
investments.</LD>
<LD>   "The rating action reflects Moody's continuing concerns that
Vivendi Universal might not be able to reduce debt as quickly and
comprehensively as planned," Moody's said in a report. Though Moody's
acknowledged Vivendi's "unequivocal commitment to debt reduction and
solid operating results," the credit-rating company also cited
"uncertainties about the future strategic evolution of the company."</LD>
<TE>   Vivendi said Moody's did not "fully take into consideration the
currently poor market conditions" and the company's debt-reduction
program. Vivendi said the rating reduction doesn't affect Vivendi's
cash position or trigger any advance repayments of bank credit lines.
The company also said it was confident it would meet its operating
targets for 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Friday's action comes at an especially bad time for
Messier, who has faced a barrage of setbacks in recent weeks,
including a management crisis in the company's European
pay-television operation, alleged tampering of vote counts in the
company's annual shareholders meeting and disclosures about
off-balance-sheet liabilities that could cost the company an
additional $1.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Messier also has been under heavy pressure from investors to
reverse the steady slide in Vivendi's stock price, which has fallen
amid questions about the company's strategy, communications with
investors and debt load.</TE>
<TE>   A string of deals in the last four years, including acquisitions
of Seagram Co.'s Universal Studios and U.S. education publisher
Houghton Mifflin, has left Vivendi's media business with about
$15billion in debt. The company's pending acquisition of the film and
TV business of USA Networks will add $2.4 billion to the debt load.</TE>
<TE>   The immediate effect of the downgrade is that Vivendi's short-term
borrowing costs probably will go up, several analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The greater concern, however, is the long-term repercussions of
the downgrade and the signal it sends to investors, who reacted
coolly to Friday's developments, sending Vivendi's shares down $1.60,
or 5.2%, to $29.07 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock, which
hit a session low of $28.30 on Friday, has tumbled more than 46% this
year.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, it's not good news," said Mark Harrington, an analyst
with J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. "Moody's reacted to the nervousness in
the market."</TE>
<TE>   If Moody's reduces the rating further, it could create serious
problems for the company, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Some institutional investors could bail out, and Vivendi could be
forced to accelerate its loan repayments according to covenants with
lenders.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not what they need right now," said Michael Nathanson, an
analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. "It's just another stick in
the eye.... It puts them a little closer to being in really bad
shape."</TE>
<TE>   Reductions in debt ratings can have significant consequences for
corporations. Enron Corp.'s demise, for example, was accelerated
after credit agencies downgraded the energy giant's bonds to junk
status.</TE>
<TE>   However, unlike Enron, Vivendi has plenty of assets it could sell
off to meet debt obligations in the event of a further rate cut,
analysts say. Vivendi has, in fact, been taking such steps.</TE>
<TE>   The company last month unloaded its professional and health
publishing unit for about $1 billion, though the purchase price was
nearly half what Messier told investors it would sell for a year ago.
At the company's annual shareholders meeting, Messier said reducing
the company's debt was a top priority this year.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi said this week that payment obligations from put options
could force it to buy back some of its own shares at levels far above
current prices, costing the company as much as $1.1 billion. And
because of the company's depressed stock price, Vivendi also may have
to pay an additional $250million to record impresario Herb Alpert and
his business partner, Jerry Moss, founders of independent music
publisher Rondor Music International Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's cited the complex financial arrangements in its report and
also questioned whether Vivendi would be able to meet its cash flow
targets this year, given the slowdown in the music business and
challenges from piracy and struggles in its Internet portal, Vizzavi.</TE>
<TE>   "The company's ambitious Vizzavi portal project, initially a
cornerstone of the new Vivendi Universal strategy, has failed to live
up to expectations," Moody's said.</TE>

<HD>Transfer Proposal Passes, Goes Into Effect This Fall</HD>
<DH>Regulations: CIF council approves measure that requires
school officials to certify no previous contact with transfers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a decision that underscored growing disdain for the statewide
surge in transfers for athletic purposes, the California
Interscholastic Federation's federated council on Friday
overwhelmingly approved a proposal that aims to curtail recruiting in
high school sports.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal, adopted by a 97-23 vote at the Ontario Airport
Marriott, will require school officials to certify that no one
connected with their booster clubs or athletic programs has had
contact with transfers. The new rule takes effect on a two-year trial
basis starting next school year.</LD>
<LD>   "This has been a significant piece of legislation to get through,"
said Southern Section Commissioner Jim Staunton, a member of the
committee that developed the proposal. "Now we're going to focus on
folks literally saying, 'I did not talk to this kid before [he or she
transferred],' and hopefully forcing the issue as to whether people
are talking to get kids to make transfers."</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles City Section was one of only two sections that
opposed the measure. Barbara Fiege, director of interscholastic
athletics for the City Section, said her constituents agreed with the
intent of the proposal but were concerned that it would force
athletes awaiting approval to sit out games while administrators
sorted through paperwork.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the action could be construed as moving one step closer to
adopting more restrictive statewide transfer legislation, such as a
proposal recently adopted by the Southern Section council that will
prohibit students who transfer without moving from participating in
varsity sports for one year, beginning with the 2003-04 school year.</TE>
<TE>   The City and Central sections are already considering similar
proposals. The City Section is expected to vote on the issue next
March.</TE>
<TE>   Marie Ishida, executive director of the CIF, said two potential
stumbling blocks are the possibility of costly litigation and
negative publicity generated by students who feel they are being
unfairly denied the chance to compete in athletics.</TE>
<TE>   "That's my concern at the moment," Ishida said. "It's not a
concern about the rule. Ultimately, all the sections could decide
that we should have that rule statewide."</TE>
<TE>   Recent litigation has centered on whether participation in
interscholastic athletics is a right or a privilege. In an opinion
upheld by the California Supreme Court, the 4th District Court of
Appeals in San Diego ruled that athletic participation is a
privilege, boosting the legitimacy of the Southern Section's new
rule.</TE>
<TE>   In other action, the council unanimously passed a proposal that
will eliminate at-large entries into the state cross-country meet
starting next fall. The proposal guarantees each section a certain
number of automatic entries based on an established minimum, plus
additional entries based on previous state meet performances.</TE>

<LD>If there's a challenge, Jeff Urton is up for it.</LD>
<LD>   Starting at quarterback? No problem.</LD>
<LD>   Playing national junior doubles beach volleyball? Finished fifth
in the world in Sydney.</LD>
<TE>   Winning a fourth consecutive Southern Section Division IV
volleyball championship? It's on his to-do list.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a disappointment if we don't win," said Urton, a
two-time All-Southern Section player for the Santa Ynez High boys'
volleyball team. "We set our goals pretty high."</TE>
<TE>   The leadership of Urton, an outside hitter headed to UC San Diego,
has been a critical component for the volleyball team's amazing
success.</TE>
<TE>   The three-time defending section champion Pirates are 20-0 this
season and No. 3 in The Times' rankings heading into the volleyball
playoffs. The pairings will be announced Monday and Santa Ynez,
ranked No. 1 in Division IV, is expected to be the top-seeded team in
the division.</TE>
<TE>   Since his first day of varsity play as a freshman, Urton has been
recognized as much for his physical ability as his engaging
personality.</TE>
<TE>   "His confidence stood out to me from the beginning, and
physically, he's amazingly quick," Coach Chip Fenenga said. "He's
been around future Division I and All-American players, and even then
there would be a little bright light around him."</TE>
<TE>   Urton, who was also a three-year standout goalkeeper for the Santa
Ynez water polo team, provides positive reinforcement for his
teammates, making sure everyone gets involved.</TE>
<TE>   "Jeff will say, 'Let's go guys,' those kinds of things, and when
subs come in, Jeff will encourage them," Fenenga said. "Some other
kids [I've coached] hated to lose and would go after a kid no matter
what, but Jeff is not that way. He's pretty accommodating."</TE>
<TE>   When the Santa Ynez football team had a vacancy at quarterback,
the 6-foot-4 senior decided to give up water polo and try out for the
position, even though the closest he had come to football was
watching it from the stands or on TV.</TE>
<TE>   He split his time last spring between the football squad and the
volleyball team, which was preparing for the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   After he helped the Pirates defeat Corona del Mar, 15-9, 15-5,
15-8, for their third consecutive section volleyball title, Urton
dedicated himself full time to football and took the process of
learning a new sport in stride.</TE>
<TE>   "Learning the new plays was a new challenge for him," said his
mother, Linda Urton. "Jeff never gets frustrated or overreacts. In
water polo, if he blocked a goal or let one get by he would always
stay calm and in control."</TE>
<TE>   Urton took over full time at quarterback after leading the Pirates
to their first victory, 21-7, over San Marcos in the fifth game of
the season.</TE>
<TE>   "He put on a performance that night, making a big play early on
and opening it up," football Coach Ken Gruendyke said. "His
confidence grew immensely during that game.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a key game for the team and a key game for him. He
showed the kids that he was there to lead the team."Though the
Pirates finished 2-8 overall and 1-4 in the Los Padres League, Urton
said all the hard work was worth it.</TE>
<TE>   "I loved playing," he said. "I was sad when it was over. It was
enjoyable going out on Friday nights under the lights."</TE>
<TE>   In a few weeks his high school volleyball career will also come to
a close, but the Urton legacy will live on at Santa Ynez, where his
brothers, sophomore twins Nick and Nate, were members of the junior
varsity this season.</TE>
<TE>   Over the summer, Jeff will continue to play volleyball,
participating in doubles tournaments at the beach and with his Club
Santa Barbara team until he leaves for UC San Diego, and yet another
challenge.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The San Clemente High boys' swim team won its first South Coast
League title Friday, securing the victory at the finals at Lake
Forest El Toro High by taking three of the top five spots in the
third-to-last event, the 100-yard backstroke.</LD>
<LD>   The Tritons, who finished the dual-meet season undefeated and
ranked No. 1 by The Times, scored 411.5 points. Mission Viejo, ranked
No. 2, was second with 365.5 points, and defending league champion
Capistrano Valley was third with 335.5.</LD>
<LD>   Kenny Yamamoto was the only winner for San Clemente, defending his
titles in the 200 individual medley in 1 minute 55.06 seconds and the
100 backstroke in 53.05. Yamamoto, a junior, is one of several
Tritons swimmers who led the water polo team to the Southern Section
semifinals last fall.</LD>
<TE>   San Clemente Coach Marc Parker said recent swim teams have also
included several water polo players, but this season's squad showed
more commitment.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't that [the water polo players] weren't talented enough
in the past," Parker said. "They just didn't care."</TE>
<TE>   Capistrano Valley's Pat Cary broke a two-year-old meet record in
the 100 butterfly. He won in 50.42, edging Mission Viejo's Devin Saez
(50.43) and lowering the meet record of 50.49, set by Mission Viejo's
Juan Veloz.</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo moved into second by taking the top two spots in the
second-to-last event, the 100 breaststroke. Alejandro Jacobo defended
his title in 58.56 and Paul Divan was second in 59.06.</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente defended its girls' title with the help of senior
Kristen Caverly, who won the 200 freestyle (1:52.93) and 100
backstroke (57.50) and swam a 27.7 opening leg on the Tritons'
winning 200 medley relay (1:53.20).</TE>
<TE>   The Tritons scored 477 points, Capistrano Valley was second (413)
and El Toro third (338).</TE>
<TE>   In track and field:</TE>
<TE>   South Coast League finals--Matt Bruno of host Mission Viejo
Trabuco Hills won the boys' 100 meters in a wind-aided 10.33 seconds
and the 200 in a career-best 21.22.</TE>
<TE>   Bruno was slowed by a groin injury and tendinitis in his right
foot earlier in the season. But his 100 clocking was the fastest of
his career under any conditions and his 200 time cut .17 seconds off
his previous best. It was also the second-fastest time in the state
this year behind the 21.11 that Reggie Bush of La Mesa Helix ran to
win the Arcadia Invitational on April 13.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific View League finals--Phillip Reid of Oxnard Rio Mesa, the
state leader in the boys' 1,600 at 4:12.25, won that event in
4:25.75, the 3,200 in 9:37.25 and ran a 52.0-second leg on the
victorious 1,600 relay team that timed 3:30.75 in the meet at Oxnard
Hueneme.</TE>
<TE>   Sea View League finals--Michelle Sanford leaped a wind-aided
42-51/2, best in the nation, to win the triple jump Thursday at
Woodbridge.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the most storied collegiate track and field rivalries in the
country will be renewed today when UCLA hosts USC in a Pacific 10
Conference dual meet at Drake Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   The meet starts at 9 a.m. with the women's hammer throw. Track
events begin at 12:30 p.m. with the women's 3,000-meter steeplechase.</LD>
<LD>   The USC and UCLA men's programs have combined to win 34 NCAA
outdoor titles, but the women's meet will draw the most attention
nationally because it matches the top two teams from last year's NCAA
meet.</LD>
<TE>   USC won its first women's NCAA title last year and is favored to
win again at Louisiana State May 29-June 1. But NCAA runner-up UCLA
is the five-time defending conference champion and has beaten USC in
nine consecutive dual meets.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruin women, who have a 15-3 series edge against the Trojans,
have been the top-ranked dual-meet team in the nation for the last
six years.</TE>
<TE>   The results of the women's shotput, discus throw, hammer and
javelin could be crucial in determining the outcome because a
traditionally powerful UCLA throwing squad is expected to be
challenged by a strong group from USC.</TE>
<TE>   The women's meet will include five athletes who have produced
NCAA-leading marks in their events this year and the men's meet will
include one.</TE>
<TE>   The USC men ended a 22-meet losing streak to UCLA last year with
an 82-81 victory, but the Trojans will be underdogs today.</TE>
<TE>   USC leads the series, 39-29.</TE>

<LD>It's hard enough to defeat a team three times in a season, but four?</LD>
<LD>   That will be the challenge for Pepperdine today when the Waves go
for their fifth national men's volleyball championship as they face
Hawaii at State College, Pa. The match is scheduled for 4 p.m. PDT
and will be shown live on ESPN2.</LD>
<LD>   Top-ranked Pepperdine (29-4) twice beat second-seeded Hawaii
(23-8) in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play and again in the
championship of the conference tournament last weekend.</LD>
<TE>   Pepperdine freshman outside hitter Sean Rooney has 58 kills
against Hawaii in the three matches with a .457 hitting percentage.
Senior outside hitter Lance Walker has 52 kills and junior middle
blocker Brad Keenan has 26 blocks.</TE>
<TE>   The Waves also have been successful in holding Hawaii senior
outside hitter Costas Theocharidis to a hitting percentage of .303.</TE>
<TE>   This is Pepperdine's ninth appearance in the NCAA title game, but
its first since a 1998 loss to UCLA. Hawaii, which is seeking its
first national championship in any men's sport, last reached the
title game in 1996, also losing to UCLA.</TE>

<HD>Red Smith Award Goes to Dick Schaap</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Dick Schaap went about the business of journalism with a twinkle in
his eye, never taking himself or his subject too seriously.</LD>
<LD>   He shunned pretense and embraced people, and it didn't matter
whether his subject was a pitcher or a president, a golfer or a
governor. Schaap, who died in December, is the 2002 winner of the
Associated Press Sports Editors Red Smith Award, for extended
meritorious service to sports journalism.</LD>
<LD>   Voters were past APSE presidents and past winners of the award.
Dallas Morning News sports editor Dave Smith, who qualifies on both
counts, said there were 14 names on the ballot, and "Dick was an
overwhelming winner."</LD>
<TE>   Months after his death, Schaap continues to win awards. He was the
first journalist inducted into the True Heroes of Sport Hall of Fame
by the Northeastern University Center for Sport and Society. He also
won his fourth sports Emmy last month, this one for his
autobiography.</TE>

<HD>Wise Choice Would Be to Take Your Best Shot</HD>

<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Swale gave Laffit Pincay his only Kentucky Derby victory 18
years ago, the son of Seattle Slew was well-positioned from the
outset, tracking the filly Althea and the overmatched longshot Bear
Hunt.</LD>
<LD>   After about three-quarters of a mile had been run in the 11/4-mile
race, Swale and Pincay took over, opening up a five-length lead with
an eighth of a mile to run and going on to win by a little more than
three lengths.</LD>
<LD>   In trying to become the oldest rider ever to win the Derby,
Pincay, 55, could get a similar pace scenario aboard Medaglia d'Oro
today in the 128th running of the world's most famous race.</LD>
<TE>   In the Wood Memorial, arguably the best prep race for the Kentucky
Derby, Medaglia d'Oro took the early lead and battled head and head
with winner Buddha, who was scratched from the Derby Friday because
of a bruised foot.</TE>
<TE>   Medaglia d'Oro also took the early lead in his previous race, the
San Felipe Stakes at Santa Anita. The El Prado colt relinquished the
lead when challenged at three-quarters of a mile and fell back a half
length but came back on and won by 21/2 lengths.</TE>
<TE>   He could be in position to stalk the pace today with front-running
types such as War Emblem, the wire-to-wire winner of the Illinois
Derby, 50-1 shot Wild Horses, Request For Parole and Proud Citizen in
the 19-horse field.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who also should be be positioned just off the early
lead are Private Emblem, the improving New York-bred who was visually
impressive winning in the Arkansas Derby, Santa Anita Derby winner
Came Home, Breeders' Cup juvenile winner Johannesburg and
morning-line favorite Harlan's Holiday. Danthebluegrassman and Ocean
Sound should also be positioned near the lead early but all they'll
do is clutter up the field.</TE>
<TE>   Among the contenders who figure to be lagging behind early are
Perfect Drift, Castle Gandolfo, Essence of Dubai, Easy Grades and
Lusty Latin.</TE>
<TE>   Jockey Eddie Delahoussaye, who won back-to-back Kentucky Derbies
with Gato Del Sol and Sunny's Halo in the early 1980s, will ride
Perfect Drift. The gelding won the first time Delahoussaye rode him
in the Spiral Stakes at Turfway Park on March 23. Castle Gandolfo and
Essence Of Dubai are the only runners who have raced at the Derby
distance, and both handled it well.</TE>
<TE>   After the pretenders--Wild Horses, Request For Parole, War Emblem,
who is much more likely to finish last than he is to win, and Proud
Citizen--pack it in, the Derby should boil down to Medaglia d'Oro,
Private Emblem, Came Home, Harlan's Holiday, Perfect Drift, Essence
Of Dubai and Castle Gandolfo. Lusty Latin, Saarland and Easy Grades
could find their way into the trifecta or superfecta.</TE>
<TE>   In a year with no standouts, and in which some of the top
contenders come with distance questions attached, the thing to do is
take a stab at a horse who will be a price.</TE>
<TE>   So, the nod here goes to Private Emblem, a 20-1 shot on the
morning line who keeps getting better and has reportedly trained well
at Churchill Downs. The colt would be the first New York-bred to win
the Derby.</TE>

<LD>Nice job, burying on Page D8 the news of the latest scam--er,
plan--to bring an NFL team to L.A. ["Land Project Could Yield
Stadium," May 2].</LD>
<LD>   Mayor Hahn and the City Council once again show how out of touch
they are with the public. Angelenos just don't want another American
football team and the concomitant taxpayer burden.</LD>
<LD>   As for "a proposal [that] would create a powerful Community
Redevelopment Authority"--there already is a CRA, with a plan for
residential use of the "South Park" area that has been on the books,
and supposedly in the works, since 1975.</LD>
<TE>   If Mayor Hahn and his cronies want to fast-track a new team and
stadium so badly, put them in the Valley and let the businesspeople
in Secession City foot the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Or put the stadium downtown, but go all the way. Bring Michael
Ovitz back on board the development train and call the new football
team the L.A. Weasels.</TE>

<HD>Buddha Out; Trainer Is Stirred, Not Shaken</HD>

<DL>LOUISVILLE, KY.</DL>
<LD>The atmosphere in trainer James Bond's 007 Stable at Churchill Downs
couldn't have been grimmer had Dr. No, Odd Job and Auric Goldfinger
shown up at the same time.</LD>
<LD>   It was early Friday morning, a couple of hours after Bond, of the
same name as author Ian Fleming's spy extraordinaire, had found
Buddha lame in his stall. The Wood Memorial winner, and at 5-1 the
co-second choice with Came Home on the morning line, was immediately
scratched from today's running of the 128th Kentucky Derby.</LD>
<LD>   Bond, who has never run a horse in the Derby, will have to wait at
least one more year. At 44, he is a racetrack lifer. He started
galloping horses when he was 11 and has been training them since he
was 16.</LD>
<TE>   He tried to spin Buddha's bruised left front foot as positively as
possible but underneath that blue baseball cap was a crushed
horseman.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very disappointing," Bond said. "Making it worse is that the
owners were here to see the horse go out on the track today. I guess
it was fate--it was just not meant to be. It doesn't appear to be a
serious injury. With a lesser horse, you might [run], but I have a
gut feeling that this is the right thing to do. This is such a
valuable horse, not the kind you'd run by just putting a Band-Aid on
him."</TE>
<TE>   Buddha, owned by Gary and Mary West of Omaha, would have been
ridden by Pat Day, who won the 1992 Derby with Lil E. Tee. Day, who
hasn't missed a Derby since 1983, will now replace Corey Nakatani on
Blue Burner today.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Mott, Blue Burner's trainer, said that Nakatani, injured in a
spill at Hollywood Park on Thursday, had suffered a slight concussion
and was still complaining about dizziness Friday. At Hollywood Park,
Nakatani's agent, Bob Meldahl, said Nakatani wouldn't ride until next
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   In only his fourth start, Buddha won the Wood against a solid
field that included Medaglia d'Oro and Saarland, who are running in
the Derby, and Sunday Break, who would have been a factor today had
he earned enough graded-stakes money to start.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always said that I wouldn't come to the Derby until I had a
horse that I could be proud of," Bond said. "I thought this was the
horse. I had gotten Derby fever lately too, but unfortunately the
water got too hot."</TE>
<TE>   Bond said that Buddha would not run in the Preakness at Pimlico on
May 18. Beyond that, the trainer was uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to lose some training time and that will determine
what we do from here," Bond said. "This horse will still do well by
us. We've stubbed our toe, but we haven't jumped off the bridge."</TE>

<TE>   Update--Dallas, playing its home opener, is an Arena expansion
team. But the Desperados so far have been tough. They beat Carolina
in the season opener, 57-44, and lost last week to New Jersey, 45-44,
when quarterback Andy Kelly threw an interception with six seconds
left. Kelly, an eight-year Arena veteran who played in two league
championship games with Nashville (now Georgia), is off to a solid
start, having completed 42 of 70 passes for 481 yards and 10
touchdowns. Avenger receiver Chris Jackson is off to an even better
start. The Los Angeles offensive specialist leads the league in
receptions with 23, yards receiving with 387, and in scoring with 60
points on 10 touchdowns. Jackson caught five touchdown passes last
week in a 63-59 loss to Arizona.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Paul Pierce and Antoine Walker didn't simply knock the Philadelphia
76ers out of the playoffs, they demolished the defending Eastern
Conference champions.</LD>
<LD>   Pierce scored 46 points--the fifth-best playoff performance in
franchise history--as the Celtics won the final game of their
best-of-five first-round series, 120-87, to advance to a conference
semifinal matchup against the Detroit Pistons.</LD>
<LD>   Walker had 26 points, nine rebounds and six assists for the
Celtics, who are making their first postseason appearance since 1995.
They had not advanced in the playoffs since 1992, Larry Bird's final
season.</LD>
<TE>   Allen Iverson scored 31 as the 76ers tried to become the seventh
team to win a five-game series after losing the first two. But they
wilted when the Celtics went on a 19-4 run late in the fourth
quarter, rekindling memories of the Boston Garden and the 16 NBA
titles the Celtics won there.</TE>
<TE>   "To have the game in hand and be able to soak up the atmosphere
was a bonus--a great luxury," said Boston's Jim O'Brien, who is
making his first playoff appearance as a head coach.</TE>
<TE>   Pierce was eight for 10 from three-point range, one of his threes
giving Boston a 97-79 lead with 6:05 left. The 76ers called time out,
and the FleetCenter scoreboard showed crowd shots of Red Auerbach,
Tommy Heinsohn, Danny Ainge, JoJo White and Cedric Maxwell. The fans
went wild at the sight of the former Celtic stars, and the team
responded.</TE>
<TE>   Walker made a three-point basket to give Boston a 30-point lead
with 3:11 left, but was called for a technical for taunting.</TE>
<TE>   "To feel what some of the old guys were talking about, that we've
heard about. To finally be a part of it and to build our own era,"
Walker explained. "That's what I was celebrating."</TE>
<TE>   The Boston fans closed it out with a traditional chant of "Beat
L.A.!"</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia Coach Larry Brown dismissed rumors that he would not
return next season and said: "If we'd played our best [Friday], I
don't think that would have been good enough. They hadn't been to the
playoffs in quite a while. But we met a team that appeared to be more
relaxed than ours did."</TE>
<TE>   Brown's contract runs through 2004-05, but he had had a spotty
relationship with Iverson. Iverson said Friday that reports of their
conflict were overblown.</TE>

<HD>Galaxy Deal Plays Into Rookie Hands</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Being traded can be a disheartening experience, especially if the
season is only four games old and you're a rookie.</LD>
<LD>   But Galaxy midfielder Winston Griffiths is taking a recent swap in
stride.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a bit of a surprise for me, knowing that I had to come out
here," said Griffiths, a Jamaican international who began his Major
League Soccer career with the New York/New Jersey MetroStars, then
was sent to the Galaxy on April 20 for a conditional superdraft pick.
"But it's been great so far. Having a teammate from Jamaica, Tyrone
[Marshall], and another Caribbean, Ezra [Hendrickson, from St.
Vincent &amp; the Grenadines], has helped. I think I fit in pretty well."</LD>
<TE>   So well that Griffiths should get significant playing time today
against the Wizards at Kansas City and could start.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the Galaxy having been hit so hard by so many
early-season injuries helps Griffiths' case.</TE>
<TE>   Midfielder Simon Elliott went down Friday during practice, after
rolling his right ankle, and is out for today, as are Hendrickson, a
defender, who has a hamstring strain; forward Chris Albright, who has
a broken right foot; and midfielder Peter Vagenas, who has a lower
back strain.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie forward Gavin Glinton is nursing sore ribs and is available
for limited minutes only, and Cobi Jones, having joined the U.S.
national team for the World Cup, is gone for at least seven MLS
games. Playmaking midfielder Mauricio Cienfuegos, though, is back
after sitting out last weekend's 1-0 overtime loss to Colorado
because of a sprained left ankle.</TE>
<TE>   "Not since I've been with this team have we had this kind of an
injury run," said fourth-year Coach Sigi Schmid. "Early in the season
is better than late in the season, better than having it happen in
the playoffs for sure."</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City, meanwhile, will be down two starters. Goalkeeper Tony
Meola is with the national team, and midfielder Kerry Zavagnin is
sitting out a red-card suspension.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good test for our young players, and that's why they're on
the team," Schmid said. "That's why they're pros. We feel they can
play."</TE>
<TE>   Among them, Alex Bengard and Jesus Ochoa, who Schmid hopes will
spell Elliott in the back-middle, and Griffiths, who Schmid said
would play as a wide midfielder.</TE>
<TE>   "The style that he wants, I've played it before as an outside left
wing, so I'm comfortable with it," said Griffiths, who made his
Galaxy debut in the 87th minute against Colorado on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "The greatest thing is that I'm still able to be in the league. So
when I get a chance to play I'll do my best."</TE>

Hartman. "We wanted to get Kevin a game.... That was important for us
to keep him in the rhythm of things," Schmid said. "But at this
stage, we're undefeated with Reis, and he knows the error that he
made in the Dallas game and he worked hard."</TE>

<LD>South Korea's K.J. Choi shot a seven-under-par 65 Friday to take a
one-stroke lead over Dan Forsman after the second round of the Compaq
Classic in New Orleans.</LD>
<LD>   "He's never led in the United States, so it is a new experience,"
Choi's translator said. "But, if everything goes as today, he keeps
the pace up and gets a better feel for the conditions, he thinks he
has a very good shot this weekend."</LD>
<LD>   Choi had an 11-under 133 total on the English Turn course.</LD>
<TE>   Forsman, the first-round leader, shot a 69.</TE>

star Bryce Molder (67) and Billy Andrade (66) followed at eight

<LD>About 50 minutes before Bobby Frankel tries to win his first Kentucky
Derby with Medaglia d'Oro, the trainer will try to win Hollywood
Park's Senorita Stakes for the third time in four years.</LD>
<LD>   Nunatall will try to emulate Fantastic Filly last year and Coracle
(1999) in the $100,000 Senorita, a Grade III at a mile on the turf.</LD>
<LD>   A 3-year-old, English-bred filly owned by Ed Gann, who also races
Medaglia d'Oro, Nunatall will have to step up her game if she wants
to win for the first time in the U.S.</LD>
<TE>   A winner of one of three in France, the daughter of Night Shift
was second as the 17-10 favorite behind stablemate Megahertz in the
Blue Norther in her first start in California on Jan. 9.</TE>
<TE>   She then was fifth and fourth in the La Habra and Some Sensation,
respectively, at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   The filly to beat in the Senorita, which is not part of a pick six
that has a carryover of $121,130.92, is High Society. An Irish-bred,
she made a successful bow for trainer Laura De Seroux, winning the
aforementioned La Habra Stakes at nearly 10-1 on March 1.</TE>
<TE>   At Aqueduct, 3-year-olds who were not Kentucky Derby material will
get together in the $150,000 Withers at one mile.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who will participate are Shah Jehan, a $4.4 million
yearling who earned his first U.S. victory last month at Keeneland
for trainer Wayne Lukas, Monthir, who was third behind Roman Dancer
in the seven-furlong Bay Shore on April 13, Listen Here and Fast
Decision.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Minister Thatcher, a Deputy Minister filly who
made a successful bow at 28-1 on April 6 for trainer Richard
Mandella, leads a field of 10 fillies and mares going 51/2 furlongs
on the turf in today's eighth race at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Jose Valdivia Jr. The jockey won three races on

<LD>Albert E. Frias' letter [April 27] is unfair to Bob Mieszerski. To
expect a newspaper handicapper to show a profit on flat bets on all
selections is simply not reasonable. Mieszerski's job obligates him
to pick a horse in every race, and no horseplayer can expect to turn
a profit betting every race. Even given that limitation, Mieszerski
was ahead of the game for most of the long Santa Anita meeting and
ended it with a loss of only $100 or so, a remarkable achievement.</LD>

<LD>I have two letters I would like you to print:</LD>
<LD>   Dear Jerry West,</LD>
<LD>   Thank you for all of the wonderful years as player, coach and GM.
Boy, it was great watching you fleece all the other GMs in the
league. Good luck in your new job!</LD>
<TE>   Dear Mitch Kupchak,</TE>
<TE>   You now have a new primary rule as Laker GM. Please repeat after
me: I will not make any trades with the Grizzlies. I will not make
any trades with the Grizzlies!</TE>

<TE>   My favorite Jerry West moment occurred 36 years ago, when West was
a player and I was 9 years old and living in Pomona. Two friends and
I rode our bikes to a store to see West and ask him to sign our
basketballs. We arrived a few minutes late and we were told he had
just left.</TE>
<TE>   Needless to say we were quite dejected and began our sad walk out
of the store. Then, much to our surprise, a man behind us asked if we
came to see him. We turned around, looked up, and there was Jerry
West! He signed our $2 basketballs and invited us to walk with him to
his car. He asked us our names, and was very friendly. He even showed
us his new Lotus. It was like Christmas morning.</TE>
<TE>   Thank you Jerry West for all the thrills you provided for us on
the basketball court. Thanks most of all for your act of kindness
that Saturday morning a long time ago.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Blum</TE>

<TE>   As a kid, I taped WEST44 on my T-shirt as I shot baskets in the
driveway. As an adult, I put WEST44 on my license plate. I was lucky
to share his name and even luckier to watch him play in person. I
still treasure the autograph he gave me after one of his 50-plus
performances in the record playoff series against the Bullets in
1965. I can still hear Chick Hearn saying, "He'll turn and shoot.
There's the turn, there's the shot, Mr. Clutch!"</TE>
<TE>   Jerry West is larger than life. Don't be surprised by anything he
accomplishes in Memphis.</TE>

<LD>Bill Plaschke, I'm writing this letter for the mechanic of Norwalk,
the milkman of Torrance, The Times sports section reader of Panorama
City.</LD>
<LD>   I'm writing this letter for the journalism teacher who taught you
to repeat the first words of several consecutive sentences as an easy
trick to add drama to an article.</LD>
<LD>   I'm writing this letter for Jerry Bruckheimer, whose dramatic
subtlety you have emulated so well. I'm writing this letter for Kobe
Bryant, Jason Allison and that dreadlocked homeless MAN who just
wanted to feel the glow of the Olympic torch of hope that you so
dramatically carried.</LD>
<TE>   But most importantly, oh you writer of articles, I'm writing this
letter for me because I'm tired of being bludgeoned over the head by
your constant over-dramatizing of sports.</TE>
<TE>   By treating every free throw, every single, every completed pass
and slap shot as an event to heal the wounds of humanity, you cheapen
the truly dramatic moments in sports that are special enough that we
don't need to read about them to understand their significance.
Please give us a break.</TE>
<TE>   If the front-page journalists of The Times can cover devastating
events with delicacy, I'm sure you can find a way to cover a Kobe
Bryant pass the same way.</TE>

<LD>Juxtapose new UCLA Athletic Director Dan Guerrero's comment, "I want
student athletes who, on the playing field, have strong fundamentals,
who fire out every night, who never take a night off" with Bob
Toledo's, "The athletic director's job is to let the coaches coach
and give them the weapons to get the job done."</LD>
<LD>   Guerrero views his position as Toledo's boss. Toledo sees Guerrero
as his facilitator. My prediction is that basketball Coach Steve
Lavin will grow under Guerrero's tutelage and Toledo will be
replaced. Let the fun begin!</LD>

<TE>   I'd like to add my voice to what I'm sure will be a large chorus
singing the praises of new UCLA Athletic Director Dan Guerrero. To
say that his presence and sense of integrity will be welcome is no
small understatement.</TE>
<TE>   The past few years have caused many a UCLA alum like myself to
cringe in embarrassment. From vastly underachieving football and
basketball teams to lapses in integrity (and by implication,
administrative oversight) that resulted in players obtaining false
handicapped-parking permits and losing eligibility for taking gifts.</TE>
<TE>   I hope that Mr. Guerrero maintains the commitment to integrity and
scholarship (along with athletics) that has made such a difference
during his tenure at UC Irvine. May he be successful in changing the
system and not succumbing to a "win at all costs" mentality.
Hopefully he will be instrumental in putting the "student" back into
the "student athlete" at UCLA.</TE>

<LD>I hope young people are paying attention to the Darryl Strawberry
case. People like Darryl Strawberry (or Robert Downey Jr., etc.) have
more willpower, discipline and determination than most of us can even
imagine in order to get to the tops of their fields. And yet, once
the drugs take hold, all of that willpower, discipline and
determination mean nothing.</LD>
<LD>   I'm sure there are some young people out there today thinking
about trying drugs, and they're saying to themselves, "If I start to
get hooked, I can always stop." Well, look at Darryl and think again.
Then instead of lighting up that crack pipe, maybe just say a little
prayer for Darryl, and while you're at it, thank God that it's not
you.</LD>

<LD>By the end of tonight's 11-race card at Los Alamitos, only 10 of 90
2-year-olds will still be in the running for the $361,000
Kindergarten Futurity on May 18, the first leg of the Los Alamitos
Bonanza. The track will award a $1-million bonus to any horse
sweeping the Kindergarten, the Ed Burke Memorial Futurity on July 27
and the Los Alamitos Million on Dec. 13.</LD>
<LD>   Trainer Jaime Gomez, who has won the Kindergarten the last two
years for owner Dutch Masters III with Sassy Smith and Secret Card,
will be a busy man tonight. He has entered 22 horses in the trials
and it would be a major upset if he did not have multiple qualifiers.
His top contenders include Coup Of Corona, Great Tip, Ponderosa Ruby,
Strawfly Te, Flys R Streakin and Suzy Cartel. The entire card
consists of trials; each is run at 300 yards.</LD>
<LD>   The picks: 1. Female Friend. 2. Red Lipstick. 3. Morning Snow. 4.
Ponderosa Ruby. 5. Doreme Fasolasi Win. 6. Throwin A Fit. 7. Flys R
Streakin. 8. Night Lines. 9. A Royal Of Class. 10. Lonely Moon Sign.
11. Suzy Cartel.</LD>
<TE>   Four! Let's single Female Friend in the first, use Red Lipstick,
Under My Wing and Coup Of Corona in the second, Morning Snow, Great
Tip, Sum Special Strawfly and Whispering Lies in the third and
Ponderosa Ruby, Stel Corona and Scuba Steve in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Strawfly Te will be getting Lasix in the fifth
for Gomez after disappointing at 1-2 in his debut. Shenoshezroyal
also gets Lasix for Gomez in the sixth after hopping in the air in
her debut on April 12.</TE>

<HD>Spain Reigns After Victory</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: She sets female earnings record on day
McCarron wins Kentucky Oaks aboard longshot Farda Amiga.</DH>

<DL>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>Chris McCarron, warming up for his Kentucky Derby assignment today on
Came Home, rode 20-1 longshot Farda Amiga to a 11/4-length victory
Friday in the $562,100 Kentucky Oaks, two hours after Spain won
another stake at Churchill Downs to become North America's record
female purse earner.</LD>
<LD>   Spain, ridden by Jerry Bailey for owner Ahmed Salman and trainer
Wayne Lukas, fought off Mystic Lady by 11/4 lengths in the $334,200
Louisville Breeders' Cup Handicap to end an 11-race losing streak.
Kept in training primarily to make a run at the earnings record,
Spain picked up $207,204 to hike her total to $3.3 million and pass
the retired Serena's Song. The old record holder, who was elected
into the Racing Hall of Fame last Tuesday, earned $3.2 million.</LD>
<LD>   Lukas also trained Serena's Song. "I have a soft spot for both of
them," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Spain's time for 11/16 miles was 1:494/5 as she registered her
eighth victory--to go with nine seconds and six thirds--in 33 starts.
De Bertie finished third in the six-horse field. Spain paid $8 as the
second choice. Favored Forest Secrets ran fifth.</TE>
<TE>   McCarron won the Oaks for the third time aboard a filly that had
run her first four races on grass in California. Farda Amiga's first
dirt start was a fourth-place finish in the Santa Anita Oaks, won by
You on March 9.</TE>
<TE>   "She was better that day than the two lengths she got beat,"
McCarron said. "She got squeezed early, and then down the backstretch
she started climbing after getting dirt thrown in her face."</TE>
<TE>   On a fast track, Farda Amiga ran 11/8 miles in 1:502/5,
overhauling the 8-5 favorite, Take Charge Lady, inside the sixteenth
pole. Victor Espinoza, the rider of Habibti, who was third, beaten by
21/2 lengths, claimed foul against Farda Amiga for interference in
the stretch, but the stewards let the result stand. The winner paid
$42.</TE>
<TE>   You finished fourth, followed by Take The Cake, Ile de France, Ms
Brookski, Imperial Gesture and Art Fair. Bella Bellucci was
scratched.</TE>
<TE>   The Brazilian-owned Farda Amiga is trained by Paulo Lobo, a
33-year-old Brazilian who formed a California stable 16 months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Attendance was 101,923, third highest for an Oaks day.</TE>
<TE>   Today's forecast calls for a dry, partly cloudy day, with
temperatures in the mid-70s, for the Kentucky Derby.... With only
$251,953 in the win pool after Friday's betting, Saarland is the 5-1
favorite. Harlan's Holiday was also 5-1 after Friday, but had less
bet on him than Saarland. After the first two came Came Home and
Perfect Drift, both 7-1, and Johannesburg and Medaglia d'Oro at 11-1.</TE>

<HD>FIFA Officials Call for President's Resignation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>FIFA, soccer's international governing body, was left in disarray
Friday when its general secretary, Michel Zen-Ruffinen, delivered a
30-page condemnation of the organization.</LD>
<LD>   In a confidential report to FIFA's 24-member executive committee,
Zen-Ruffinen alleged corruption, misleading accounting practices and
conflicts of interest so serious that they might lead to criminal
charges being filed against some executive committee members.</LD>
<LD>   Stunned by the revelations, five of seven FIFA vice presidents
attending the 10-hour, closed-door meeting in Zurich, Switzerland,
immediately called for the resignation of Joseph "Sepp" Blatter,
FIFA's president.</LD>
<TE>   Blatter, who is running for a second four-year term, refused to
step down, claiming that only the 204-member FIFA Congress, which
meets in Seoul on May 29, has the right to dismiss him.</TE>
<TE>   "It is time for FIFA to clean its house," Zen-Ruffinen, a
44-year-old lawyer and former referee, said during a news conference
after the day-long meeting. "This is a serious report, with serious
allegations."</TE>
<TE>   Blatter, who had tried to bring his attorney into the meeting,
only to be rebuffed, said he would reply in writing to the
allegations within seven days.</TE>
<TE>   Blatter, a 66-year-old former Swiss banker and army colonel who is
locked in a bitter struggle with Issa Hayatou of Cameroon, president
of the Confederation of African Football (CAF), for control of FIFA,
has claimed the fuss is merely election-year politics.</TE>
<TE>   "In election time people try to find things that can touch other
people," he said. "But taking the FIFA president apart is not easy to
do."</TE>
<TE>   But FIFA Vice President Chung Mong-Joon of South Korea said
Blatter had run roughshod over the rules, especially when he
suspended an internal audit of FIFA's finances that had been ordered
by the executive committee in the wake of the bankruptcy of FIFA's
marketing partner, ISL/ISMM.</TE>
<TE>   "FIFA is facing the most serious integrity problem as an
organization since its foundation [in 1904]," Chung said.</TE>
<TE>   Zen-Ruffinen went even further in his denunciation, claiming that
two executive committee members, whom he declined to identify, had
acted unethically, if not illegally.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not want to go into detail, but two people have been
bought," he told Reuters. "It wasn't a case of the president being
bought, but it was a case of the president buying. In one of the
cases, an instruction was given on behalf of the president. The
second one was a direct payment."</TE>
<TE>   At day's end, the executive committee voted to reinstate the
internal audit, but only after the World Cup, May 31-June 30 in Japan
and South Korea.</TE>

<HD>Duncan's Presence No Minor Difference</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>If Tim Duncan can have this dramatic effect on not one but two teams,
maybe he really is the most valuable player in the NBA.</LD>
<LD>   Duncan's return after a one-game absence to attend his father's
memorial service was the only major difference in the rosters, yet
the Spurs' victory in the decisive Game 5 of the first round was a
reversal from Game 4.</LD>
<LD>   San Antonio beat the Seattle SuperSonics, 101-78, and outshot them
46% to 34% Friday night at the Alamodome. Quite a turnaround from
Wednesday night in Seattle, when the Spurs shot 33% to Seattle's 50%
and the SuperSonics won, 91-79, to send the series back to San
Antonio.</LD>
<TE>   Can one guy make that much of an impact?</TE>
<TE>   "Sure he can," Spur Coach Gregg Popovich said. "You just saw it.
That's what superstars do for a team. It makes everybody else better
on a club when you have your stars. It makes so many different things
happen at both ends of the floor. It's not just that he scores, but
on defense, blocking shots or changing shots, limiting teams to one
rebound, getting the fastbreak going. And the offense, he's basically
a quarterback for us. He finds a lot of people."</TE>
<TE>   Duncan finished with 23 points and nine rebounds. He blocked seven
shots, deterred several others and attracted so much defensive
attention that the Spurs' jump shooters had all the open looks they
wanted.</TE>
<TE>   It's no wonder the fans chanted "M-V-P" every time he shot free
throws.</TE>
<TE>   Can Duncan pull off the truly impressive and lead the Spurs past
the Lakers in the Western Conference semifinals that start Sunday in
Los Angeles?</TE>
<TE>   Following the most admirable performance of these playoffs will
require some help from the Admiral.</TE>
<TE>   David Robinson, suffering from a lower back sprain, hasn't played
since a seven-minute stint in Game 1 two weeks ago. He's getting
closer. After skipping the trip to Seattle he went through the team's
shootaround Friday morning and warmed up on the court before Game 5.
But he was scratched after a review by the team's medical staff
shortly before the game.</TE>
<TE>   A longer layoff would help Robinson's back. But the Spurs sounded
as if they couldn't wait to get the chance to avenge last season's
Western Conference finals sweep by the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to get these guys," Duncan said. "Everybody does."</TE>
<TE>   If Robinson can't go on Sunday, that means Duncan will be seeing a
lot more of Shaquille O'Neal than is recommended. That's probably the
least of his concerns right now, however. His father, William, died
on Monday. Duncan flew to St. Croix in the Virgin Islands after
hearing the news and returned Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   He seems like his normal self.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, as teammate and good friend Antonio Daniels said,
"He's so stoic, you really don't know what he's feeling inside."</TE>
<TE>   After the game, Duncan gave a little hint.</TE>
<TE>   "It' s kind of been a whirlwind," he said. "It's been a tough last
couple of days. I had some great support from my family, from my
friends all over, especially my teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "With everybody's support, it was great to get back here and get
back on the floor and have an opportunity to play again. It's kind of
like a sanctuary out there. You're out there and you play and it's
basketball and you kind of get away from everything else."</TE>
<TE>   It didn't take Duncan too long to get back into NBA playoff mode.
At first he looked to pass when he got the ball, and his first shot
didn't draw iron.</TE>
<TE>   But he got on track with two free throws, then he rebounded a Tony
Parker miss and scored to get back in the groove. He went around
Vladimir Radmanovic for a layup, and about four minutes later he made
one of his signature bank shots.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to come out and force anything," Duncan said. "I
knew my rhythm would be a little bit off to start the game. I just
wanted to come out and get a feel for the game, maybe try to get an
easy basket and work it from there."</TE>
<TE>   He had eight points and five rebounds in eight minutes in the
first quarter. The SuperSonics had 10 points and six rebounds. The
entire team, the entire quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan's presence energized the Spurs and it must have somehow
freaked out the SuperSonics.</TE>
<TE>   That sure beats the other explanation: That the SuperSonics were a
bunch of cowards who weren't up to the challenge of a win-or-get-out
game on the road.</TE>
<TE>   They dropped out early, missing 14 of their first 17 shots.</TE>
<TE>   The only one who looked as if he wanted play was Gary Payton, and
he had a bad shooting night, making only eight of 26 shots to finish
with 23 points. At least he wanted to shoot. Apparently, Brent Barry
recused himself from this series and forgot to notify anyone.</TE>
<TE>   That's one reason Payton had only five assists. That was good
enough to lead the SuperSonics this game, as were his nine rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Seattle was without Rashard Lewis, the team's second-leading
scorer, who separated his left shoulder in Game 3. But they didn't
seem to miss him in Game 4. And Lewis alone couldn't have made up
that 53-39 rebounding gap.</TE>
<TE>   Mix no hustle with bad shooting and you get a deficit that
ballooned to 33 points in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome of this one was decided so early that the crowd of
23,369 at the Alamodome began chanting "Beat L.A." with 7:21 left in
the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Not likely. But as long as Duncan's around, at least they can
entertain the thought.</TE>

<HD>Baseball Seeks Newspaper Documents</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Major League Baseball asked the Star Tribune of Minneapolis to turn
over documents that might show financial connections between the
newspaper and the Minnesota Twins, the Metrodome or proposals for a
new stadium.</LD>
<LD>   The league is seeking the documents and testimony from a newspaper
representative and lawyers for the Metropolitan Sports Facilities
Commission.</LD>
<LD>   The request came three days after the Associated Press, the Star
Tribune and KARE-TV argued in district court that the public should
be given a better opportunity to see documents in the lawsuit brought
by the commission against the Twins and major league baseball.</LD>
<TE>   The commission, which operates the Metrodome, is trying to prevent
the Twins from leaving after the 2002 season.</TE>
<TE>   Star Tribune publisher Keith Moyer said attorneys for the
newspaper were reviewing the request.</TE>
<TE>   The Montreal Expos put first baseman Andres Galarraga on the
15-day disabled list because of a strained lower back.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Montreal purchased the contract of left-hander Joey Eischen, a
former Dodger and Covina High product, to take Galarraga's roster
spot. Eischen was 1-0 with four saves in 11 relief appearances for
triple-A Ottawa.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Arizona Diamondbacks put outfielder David Dellucci on the
15-day disabled list with a left hamstring strain and activated
infielder Danny Klassen.... The Houston Astros put right-hander T.J.
Mathews on the 15-day disabled list because of a strained right
arm.... Phillies' starter Robert Person was put on the 15-day
disabled list because of a strained right elbow and Philadelphia
recalled left-handed reliever Hector Mercado from triple-A
Scranton-Wilkes-Barre.... The Toronto Blue Jays claimed right-hander
Pete Walker on waivers from the New York Mets.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mike Cameron's four home runs earned a place in the record
books--and a trip back to the minors for the pitchers who served them
up.</TE>
<TE>   After giving up Cameron's record-tying four homers and two more to
Bret Boone, Chicago White Sox pitchers Jon Rauch and Jim Parque were
optioned to triple-A Charlotte on Thursday night. The White Sox
recalled right-hander Matt Ginter and Rocky Biddle, a former Long
Beach State and Temple City High standout.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Daal Doing the Job, but He Still Wants to Start</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In another clubhouse, or in the Dodger clubhouse of a year or two
ago, veteran left-hander Omar Daal would have been a distraction. The
fact he is not a distraction despite his dissatisfaction with
pitching out of the bullpen and his repeated requests to be traded
may be the biggest upset of the season so far.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of scorn, Daal has been praised by teammates and coaches,
because whatever disagreements he has with the organization, whatever
frustration he has with his role, he has not taken them to the mound.</LD>
<LD>   That was evident again Thursday night when Daal threw three
perfect innings in the Dodgers' 3-2, 14-inning victory over the
Cincinnati Reds. Daal, who won two starts in place of the injured
Kevin Brown in late April, replaced Paul Quantrill to start the 11th
and struck out four of nine batters. Afterward, Daal, who makes $5
million this season, reiterated his desire to be a starting pitcher
or to be traded.</LD>
<TE>   "I just have to keep pitching and see if another team notices what
I'm doing," Daal said. "I can help the Dodgers as a reliever, but I
want to be a starter; I deserve to be a starter. They know I'm not
happy, but I'm showing I'm a professional. When the game starts, I
clear my mind of everything else and concentrate on winning."</TE>
<TE>   Daal is 3-0 with a 1.09 earned run average and has played a
significant role in five Dodger wins this season, two as a starter
and three as a reliever.</TE>
<TE>   With Brown and Andy Ashby recovering from elbow surgery and few
attractive options at triple-A Las Vegas--the 51s scored 45 runs in a
three-game series and were still swept by Colorado Springs this
week--the Dodgers plan to hold onto Daal as rotation insurance.</TE>
<TE>   "What he's done is absolutely awesome; you respect it, and you
marvel at it," Manager Jim Tracy said. "I understand his feelings,
but we feel very strongly that we have six starters on this club, and
his contributions have been invaluable.... The professionalism he's
displayed is off the charts."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers don't have an abundance of power, so to maximize their
offense, they must do the little things right--advance runners with
bunts or groundouts, score runners from third with less than two
outs, run the bases aggressively.</TE>
<TE>   But there has been one glaring weakness of late--in eight games
through Thursday night, Dodger pitchers failed to advance runners
with sacrifice bunts seven times, though Odalis Perez, after missing
two bunt attempts, did move a runner from second to third with a
grounder to the right side April 26.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a couple of pitchers who can improve on their bunting,
and Maury [Wills, Dodger roving instructor] will work with them,"
Tracy said. "It's very important for this team [to get good bunts
down], and I've spoken to them about it. A 100% success ratio is
impossible, but will we be above the major league norm? Yes."</TE>

<TE>   Update--Ishii was named National League rookie of the month for
April after going undefeated in his first five games, the best start
by a Dodger starting pitcher since Orel Hershiser went 6-0 to begin
the 1988 season. Ishii has benefited from the second-best run support
in the league--the Dodgers average 6.98 runs per nine innings in the
games he has started.</TE>

<HD>Horry Can't Hide in the Corner Now</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He is on a team with arguably the two best players in the league,
Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant. That's fine with Robert Horry
because he shuns the spotlight the way he does defenders.</LD>
<LD>   Many players say they don't want acclaim, but Horry means it.</LD>
<LD>   Over the years, he has passed up opportunity after opportunity to
pad his statistics, to put up big numbers in the column that draws
the most attention: points scored.</LD>
<TE>   Yet this week, even Horry's shifty moves haven't been good enough
for him to avoid the glare of that spotlight. Everybody in the media,
it seems, wants a piece of him.</TE>
<TE>   And all because of one bottom-of-the-net, 22-foot three-point shot
from the corner.</TE>
<TE>   But that's the price Horry has had to pay for sinking the
game-winning, series-clinching shot against the Portland Trail
Blazers last Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   With six days off until the start of the next series, what else
was there to talk about?</TE>
<TE>   So Horry's teammates and coach have talked about him over and
over.</TE>
<TE>   "He wears suits to the game now," said Rick Fox of playoff time,
Horry's time to shine in the league. "Rob's as fragile [physically]
as they come, so he doesn't really leave it out there for the first
60 games of the season. But we put the fear into him in practice,
which allows him to go out there [in the playoffs] fearless."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Phil Jackson said Horry's tendency to perform at his peak at
the peak time of the season is by design.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been a safety net for us," Jackson said. "When we need him,
we use him. When we don't need him, we save him. He's content to let
other people score. He doesn't have that big thrill, that lust to do
so, that others have."</TE>
<TE>   So it didn't surprise Jackson that Horry sank the biggest shot
thus far for the Lakers in the playoffs?</TE>
<TE>   "I expect it," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Power forward Samaki Walker, suffering from a bone bruise in his
left knee, is expected to play when the Lakers begin their
second-round playoff series Sunday at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not going to be 100% for a while, but we'll take what we can
get," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Walker injured the knee two weeks ago when he collided with
teammate Mark Madsen in practice.</TE>
<TE>   Walker played limited time in the Portland series.</TE>
<TE>   His biggest problem is stiffness after sitting on the bench.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers' biggest problem is that, with Walker on the bench,
their rebounding suffers.</TE>

<HD>Coliseum, Rose Bowl Want to Get in Game</HD>
<DH>Pro football: As support grows for new stadium, existing
facilities seek to position themselves as viable options.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even as support grows for building a state-of-the-art NFL stadium a
few blocks from Staples Center, advocates of the area's existing
football venues--the Coliseum and the Rose Bowl--are promoting their
sites as viable options.</LD>
<LD>   The stadium push being led by Denver billionaire Philip Anschutz
envisions one of those existing stadiums serving as a temporary home
for a transplanted NFL team until a new venue can be built in South
Park. But executives from the Rose Bowl and Coliseum see their venues
as more than steppingstones.</LD>
<LD>   "Our effort and our intent is to get an NFL franchise
permanently," Rose Bowl General Manager Darryl Dunn said. "We're
doing our due diligence. We need to do what's best for the Rose Bowl,
and the best thing for the Rose Bowl is to become a permanent site
for an NFL franchise."</LD>
<TE>   City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas recently was appointed by the
Coliseum Commission to best position that stadium to land an NFL
team.</TE>
<TE>   Ridley-Thomas, who was actively involved in the failed effort to
get an expansion franchise in 1999, said the Coliseum project is
financially feasible, but the viability of the South Park project is
still undetermined.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn, who attended the Super Bowl as a guest of the
NFL and said he anticipates L.A. having a pro team within five years,
spoke for the first time Friday about the South Park plan.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it makes sense," he said. "It's not the only place that
makes sense, but it certainly makes sense to me because I think
Staples Center has had a huge impact already in improving the quality
of life in the surrounding neighborhood. I think a new stadium would
only add to the quality of life in South Park."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's comments capped a week in which the public got its first
glimpse of what the Anschutz proposal entails and what tools Hahn and
the city might have to help it happen.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Tim Leiweke, president of Anschutz Entertainment
Group, spoke to the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce and
identified South Park as the proposed site. He also outlined a
best-case scenario that would have a team in L.A. for the 2003
season.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear how things could happen that quickly, however.
Although the San Diego Chargers are the leading candidates to move,
there is no obvious exit clause in their lease until after the 2003
season. Other teams that could potentially move in a few years are
Indianapolis, Buffalo and New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   A day before Leiweke addressed the chamber, the L.A. City Council
laid the groundwork for a massive redevelopment district with the
potential to generate billions of dollars in tax revenue, some of
which could be used to help clear the land for a new football
stadium. One of the primary objectives of the new zone--which will be
voted on Wednesday--is creating additional affordable housing and
shelters for the homeless.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal would create a strong Community Redevelopment Agency
that could help with land acquisition through the power of
condemnation, and would create a mechanism to capture tax-increment
revenues from the newly drawn district.</TE>
<TE>   It would mirror the public-private partnership that led to the
construction of Staples Center, owned by Anschutz.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't asking taxpayers to foot the bill," Hahn said of the
Staples project. "We weren't taking money out of the general fund. I
think everybody who's looked at Staples sees that it's been a huge
success. It's a creative way of doing these projects not on the backs
of taxpayers."</TE>
<TE>   Even if the Anschutz proposal makes perfect sense to the city,
Ridley-Thomas said, it still faces the daunting hurdle of dealing
with NFL owners, who need to approve a relocation.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the question is whether or not those who have recently
entered the fray have the staying power or the inclination to put up
with all the various voices the NFL will bring to bear," he said.
"It's not a question of a good proposal alone.... They have their
work cut out for them."</TE>
<TE>   A new stadium could lure UCLA away from the Rose Bowl--the Bruins'
contract with the stadium expires after next season. Students and
alumni who live in West L.A. have long complained about the
cross-basin drive to games. The prospect of playing games at a South
Park stadium might be too attractive to turn down. The Rose Bowl's
Dunn said he will fight that battle to keep UCLA if and when a new
stadium is actually built.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Lynch, general manager of the Coliseum, said he does not
believe USC would leave the stadium that has been home to Trojan
football since it opened in 1923.</TE>
<TE>   The Coliseum recently approved extending USC's lease through 2005.</TE>
<TE>   "USC has always indicated that we're their home," Lynch said. "We
love them and they love us."</TE>

<HD>Hurricanes Shut Down Canadiens</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RALEIGH, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Smart and patient. That's the story of Ron Francis and the Carolina
Hurricanes so far in the Stanley Cup playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Francis scored his 42nd career postseason goal 3:49 into the final
period and Kevin Weekes recorded his second consecutive shutout as
the Hurricanes beat the Montreal Canadiens, 2-0, Friday night at
Raleigh, N.C., to take the opening game of the Eastern Conference
semifinals.</LD>
<LD>   Erik Cole sealed it with 2:18 left, scoring his third playoff
goal.</LD>
<TE>   "We're a forechecking hockey team. We're not very creative,"
defenseman Glen Wesley said. "We're not going to get too many
two-on-one or three-on-two opportunities. But we saw the way we're
capable of playing in the third period and that's getting pucks in
deep and establishing our cycle game and taking pucks to the net.
Sometimes it has to be ugly goals, but we continue to find ways to
win."</TE>
<TE>   And Francis continues to build his Hall of Fame resume. He got his
second consecutive playoff game-winner and has Carolina in front of a
second consecutive best-of-seven series.</TE>
<TE>   "He is an amazing athlete," Wesley said. "He seems to find a way
to get the job done. It's a privilege for everyone on this hockey
team to be able to play with a guy like him."</TE>
<TE>   Montreal outscored Boston, 10-2, in the third period of its
first-round series and goalie Jose Theodore had a save percentage of
.986. But Francis was able to tip a Niclas Wallin shot past the
goalie early in the third and Weekes made it stand up, stopping 25
shots in his third postseason start.</TE>
<TE>   Theodore had just made a spectacular diving stick save on rookie
Jaroslav Svoboda five seconds before Wallin left his shot fly from 10
feet inside the blue line and Francis deflected it between the legs
of Theodore.</TE>
<TE>   "He made some saves in the second period and we were starting to
wonder a little bit," Francis said of being able to beat Theodore,
who has been nominated for the Hart Trophy as league MVP. "It was a
credit to our guys to keep battling and find a way to get the job
done."</TE>
<TE>   Game 2 is Sunday night at Carolina.</TE>

<HD>Schilling Has Too Much for Expos</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Curt Schilling struck out 14, and the Arizona Diamondbacks hit three
consecutive home runs for the second time in six days to defeat the
Montreal Expos, 6-3, Friday night at Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   Schilling (6-1) gave up five hits in seven innings, including solo
homers by Vladimir Guerrero and Michael Barrett. The right-hander
walked one to join teammate Randy Johnson as the only six-game
winners in the majors.</LD>
<LD>   Danny Bautista, Steve Finley and Damian Miller homered off Bruce
Chen in the first inning to put Arizona ahead, 4-0.</LD>
<TE>   Last Sunday in Miami against the Florida Marlins, Finley, Miller
and Mark Grace hit consecutive home runs against Josh Beckett.
Arizona had hit three homers in a row only once before in the
franchise's history.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero's 10th homer of the season made it 4-2 in the sixth and
Barrett, who also had an RBI single, cut it to 4-3 with a home run in
the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Schilling, who also singled twice, reached double-digit strikeouts
for the fourth time in his seven starts.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Guillen hit a popup that hit a girder on the ballpark roof
and came down in foul territory in the eighth, then homered on the
next pitch to put Arizona ahead, 5-3.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal loaded the bases with two outs in the eighth, but Byung
Hyun-Kim--who pitched two innings Thursday night--struck out Brad
Wilkerson to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Kim then pitched a scoreless ninth for his seventh save.</TE>
<TE>   Plate umpire Larry Vanover threw Wilkerson out of the game when
the batter threw his helmet down in disgust after the called third
strike.</TE>
<TE>   Even though it was a comfortable 83 degrees outside at game time,
the roof at Bank One Ballpark was closed because Schilling likes it
that way. He feels the ball carries farther when the roof is open.</TE>
<TE>   Bautista--batting in Luis Gonzalez's usual No. 3 spot--hit a high
fly ball that barely cleared the fence in right field. Bautista has
six homers this season, one more than he had all of last year.</TE>
<TE>   Finley followed with a 427-foot shot to the porch in right-center,
then Miller hit a 3-2 pitch into the left-field seats.</TE>
<TE>   The Expos had not given up three consecutive homers since July 7,
1995.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez, mired in an 0-for-19 slump, didn't start for only the
second time since the 1999 season. He came on in a double-switch in
the eighth inning to keep his streak of consecutive games played
alive at 356, longest among active players.</TE>
<TE>   He doubled to end the slump with two outs in the eighth, then
scored on Tony Womack's single.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco 6, Cincinnati 1--Jeff Kent hit a three-run homer and
Kirk Rueter came close to his first shutout since 1995 as the Giants
won at San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Kent's one-out homer in the seventh inning off Jose Rijo (2-1)
scored David Bell, who singled, and Barry Bonds, who walked.</TE>
<TE>   Rueter (4-1) blanked the Reds for eight innings, but was pulled in
the ninth after Sean Casey and Adam Dunn opened with singles.</TE>
<TE>   Rueter has not thrown a complete game since June 29, 1999, against
Colorado, a span of 87 starts. His last shutout was Aug. 27, 1995,
with Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 6, San Diego 4--Kip Wells pitched shutout ball into the
eighth inning at San Diego and hit a home run as the Pirates broke
out of their offensive slump to defeat the Padres.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Mackowiak also homered as Pittsburgh ended its season-high
four-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   The Pirates were coming off being swept in a three-game series at
Colorado in which they scored only two runs and had seven hits
overall and became the first team in Coors Field history to be shut
out in consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 3, Colorado 2--Brandon Duckworth's pitching and
hitting sent the Phillies over the Rockies at Philadelphia, handing
Colorado its first loss under new Manager Clint Hurdle.</TE>
<TE>   Hurdle had been 6-0 since taking over when Buddy Bell was fired on
April 26.</TE>
<TE>   Duckworth (2-2) pitched 61/3 innings and also had an RBI single.
He gave up two runs, seven hits and three walks.</TE>
<TE>   New York 11, Houston 3--Jay Payton homered twice and John Valentin
drove in four runs, leading Pedro Astacio and the Mets over the
Astros at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Payton had the first multihomer game of his career, connecting
with Jeromy Burnitz in a five-run ninth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Astacio (5-1), who was traded from Colorado to Houston late last
season, continued to pitch well since signing with the Mets as a free
agent.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 8, Milwaukee 4--Preston Wilson hit two home runs as the
Marlins rallied at Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson's three-run homer highlighted a five-run burst in the
seventh inning as the Marlins overcame a 3-1 deficit. He tied a
career high with four RBIs.</TE>

<HD>Moss a Big Hit in Victory</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Brave rookie pitches seven hitless innings before
being removed for a pinch-hitter, and Atlanta defeats St. Louis in 11
innings, 2-1.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>No worries for Damian Moss, even though he didn't get a chance to
finish his no-hit bid.</LD>
<LD>   The Atlanta Brave rookie from Australia was pulled for a
pinch-hitter after seven innings and 116 pitches Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   "I knew about the no-hitter, but that was the last thing on my
mind," Moss said. "Obviously, I was getting there and the bullpen's
been great all year, so that's a wise choice to make."</LD>
<TE>   St. Louis got its first hit on Fernando Vina's one-out single in
the eighth off reliever Mike Remlinger. Chipper Jones hit a two-run
homer in the 11th, and the Braves defeated the Cardinals, 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   Moss, making his sixth career start, was wild in his longest
outing in the majors. He walked seven--including two in the seventh
inning--and bounced a handful of deliveries to the plate.</TE>
<TE>   Moss had only two 1-2-3 innings, and was helped by a double play
in his last inning. At that point, Brave Manager Bobby Cox decided
Moss had pitched enough.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to see him throw a no-hitter worse than you guys," Cox
said. "But he had so many pitches he wasn't going to make nine
anyway, and he was tired, he was done.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he'd rather have a good arm next year rather than a
no-hitter."</TE>
<TE>   Pinch-hitter Keith Lockhart, who was in the on-deck circle when
the last out of the seventh was made, grounded out batting for Moss
leading off the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Vina broke up the no-hit bid with a single off Remlinger's glove.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal starter Matt Morris was almost as good as Moss, giving up
three hits in eight scoreless innings.</TE>

<HD>Skating Union Did Little to Clean Up Salt Lake Mess</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The International Skating Union did itself no favor by imposing
three-year suspensions on figure skating judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne
and French skating federation head Didier Gailhaguet and banning them
from the 2006 Winter Games.</LD>
<LD>   Not only is it unlikely they will serve their full sentences, if
the reductions of other judges' sanctions are precedents, the
sentence is too lenient.</LD>
<LD>   If the ISU had such air-tight proof of their misconduct regarding
the pairs competition at the Salt Lake City Games that it could
impose a three-year ban, it should have taken one more step to moral
high ground and banned both for life.</LD>
<TE>   The ISU could have shown the world--and especially the
International Olympic Committee, which was horrified when the judging
scandal engulfed the Games--it won't tolerate unethical practices
among its judges and officials. Instead, it delivered a rap on the
gloved knuckles of Le Gougne and Gailhaguet and called it a punch.</TE>
<TE>   ISU President Ottavio Cinquanta cast himself and the decision as
courageous and sage. He called the ban "not too short and not too
long."</TE>
<TE>   He also said the ISU "is sending a message that it is doing the
utmost to protect the actors of the sport--the athletes."</TE>
<TE>   If he really wanted to protect them, he would have made sure they
don't have to put their careers in the hands of Le Gougne and
Gailhaguet again.</TE>
<TE>   By not setting a tough standard, Cinquanta merely fed critics who
say he can't effectively govern a sport he knows little about. His
background is in speedskating, which is under the same ISU umbrella
as synchronized skating and figure skating.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Carroll, coach of Olympic bronze medalist Tim Goebel and
former coach of Olympic silver and bronze medalist Michelle Kwan,
believes figure skating would be well served by having its own
governing body. If it weren't lumped with the other ice sports, it
might--at least in theory--have a better chance of being run by
someone familiar with the sport and its unique problems.</TE>
<TE>   "I think figure skating and speedskating should be separate
things," Carroll said. "They've gone in totally different directions
and have very little in common."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll, long a critic of bloc judging and politicized judging
deals, called the suspensions of Le Gougne and Gailhaguet "better
than nothing." He added, "I hope this is a situation where the ISU
says, 'Get your act together and play fair.'"</TE>
<TE>   Doug Williams, president of the All Year Figure Skating Club of
Culver City and a national judge, called the suspensions "a good
first step." But Williams, a former pairs skater, believes the ISU
has work to do toward restoring its integrity, and he hopes to see
progress at the ISU Council meeting next month in Kyoto, Japan.</TE>
<TE>   The judging reforms Cinquanta proposed during the Salt Lake City
Games will be discussed at Kyoto, where the U.S. Figure Skating Assn.
plans to introduce its own ideas. Cinquanta's proposal included
expanding the judging panel from nine to 14 but counting only seven
of those scores, chosen at random. He also wants to discard the
system of working downward from a perfect 6.0 score and instead score
upward from zero, based on a list of point values for jumps and
moves.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not necessarily the system that's broken, but some of the
people who are in it are tired and need to be replaced," Williams
said. "If you've got a corrupt court, you've got to get rid of the
people who make it corrupt....</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if there's going to be a consensus at the Congress.
I think nine judges on a panel is sufficient. Look at the Supreme
Court: a lot of decisions fall 5-4.</TE>
<TE>   "There has to be better due diligence in the [judges'] selection
process. The ISU has to be more involved in how they're selected.
Once they're nominated as international judges by their federations,
they should have faith in those judges' abilities."</TE>
<TE>   Judges must be renominated by their federations each year, which
gives too much leverage to federation heads such as Gailhaguet.
Making judges less beholden to the federations for appointment makes
sense. But it's difficult to imagine ISU council members willingly
relinquishing that power. And under the ISU's media-unfriendly
policies, they can vote at Kyoto to keep the status quo and not have
to answer for it.</TE>
<TE>   Russian judge Sviatoslav Babenko and Ukranian judge Alfred
Korytek, who were suspended for three and two years, respectively,
for exchanging hand signals at the 1999 World Championships, had
their terms cut in half on appeal. If the sentences against Le Gougne
and Gailhaguet are similarly trimmed, the ISU might as well close up
shop because it will have no credibility at all.</TE>
<TE>   Run to Glory</TE>
<TE>   The Kenyan men's and women's teams are favored to win the titles
at Sunday's world half-marathon championships at Brussels.</TE>
<TE>   The Kenyan men will be led by Charles Kamathi, winner of the
10,000 meters at last year's World Championships, and the women by
Tegla Laroupe, the women's marathon world-record holder.</TE>
<TE>   Each team enters five runners, but only the top three times count
toward the team score.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. men's team finished 13th last year at Bristol, England,
and the U.S. women were eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Here and There</TE>
<TE>   Australian runner Cathy Freeman, who became a national hero when
she won gold in the 400 meters at the Sydney Olympics, is having
problems with a thigh bone as she resumes training after a 13-month
layoff. Freeman had to miss her national championships last month but
was named to the Australian team for this summer's Commonwealth Games
in Manchester, England, pending a fitness test in July.</TE>
<TE>   Suzy Powell set an American record in the women's discus throw
last weekend at the UC San Diego Open. Her throw of 227 feet 10
inches (69.44 meters) broke Carol Cady's 1986 record of 216-10 (66.10
meters).</TE>

<HD>Britain and U.S. Scour Mountain Hide-Outs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BAGRAM AIR BASE, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>British Royal Marines scoured the rugged mountains of southeast
Afghanistan on Friday to search out and destroy a network of
hide-outs and supplies used by Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters.</LD>
<LD>   The first patrols in the biggest coalition deployment in two
months have yet to encounter any suspected accomplices of Osama bin
Laden, Royal Marines spokesman Lt. Col. Paul Harradine said. But they
have found caves and fortified positions suggesting the region is or
was used by enemy forces.</LD>
<LD>   "It's only just starting. They'll be moving through the area
looking for caves, looking for bunkers, looking for Al Qaeda and
Taliban," Harradine told journalists here of Operation Snipe, an
effort to cleanse a remote mountain area of forces hostile to the
interim government in Kabul, the Afghan capital.</LD>
<TE>   Harradine and U.S. military spokesman Army Maj. Bryan Hilferty
denied that the operation, in which about 1,000 troops have been
deployed to the perilous region west of the city of Khowst, was
linked with a buildup of U.S. Special Forces in the tribal regions of
Pakistan just across the border.</TE>
<TE>   But previous campaigns have shown that Al Qaeda and Taliban forces
in the mountain strongholds are able to evade each onslaught by
slipping through a honeycomb of caves and tunnels, perhaps
encouraging a two-pronged approach in the latest move.</TE>
<TE>   During the U.S.-led assaults on Tora Bora in December and on the
Shahi Kot valley in March, the Al Qaeda and Taliban forces were able
to reach refuge in the anti-Western tribal region of northwestern
Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Although the exact location of Operation Snipe has been kept
secret for security reasons, the mountainous area as described
appears to be relatively near Shahi Kot. Harradine said a day earlier
that the area of operations hadn't been probed by coalition forces
until now.</TE>
<TE>   "They've encountered evidence of caves and historical defensive
positions left there, but nothing of significance," Harradine said of
the first foot patrols in the area, which he suggested might take
weeks to comb. While no clear traces of recent enemy activity or
support have been uncovered, he reiterated that the operation was
launched because forces here have "credible intelligence" of Al Qaeda
or Taliban movements in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Harradine said the mission mandate is "to clear a given area of
land of Al Qaeda and any defensive bunkers, caches or anything they
have in that area, then allowing forces loyal to the Afghan interim
authority to take control of that region." He was referring to the
government of Prime Minister Hamid Karzai, whose ability to hold the
country together ahead of next month's convention of tribal elders to
select a new leadership has come under strain from attacks by Taliban
stragglers and regional warlords.</TE>
<TE>   Operation Snipe is part of an extended mission, known as Operation
Mountain Lion, to expunge the volatile east-central Afghan mountains
of the Taliban and their Al Qaeda allies. Although Afghans in the
region of Operation Snipe are often supportive of the Taliban and the
movement's fundamentalist Islamic tenets, Harradine said British
troops so far have been received congenially in the villages they are
searching.</TE>
<TE>   "The reconnaissance forces have built up a daily pattern of normal
life out there, and I contend so far that what they've seen is good
news," Harradine said. "That does involve people moving around with
weapons, but Afghan people do carry weapons and they go about their
business carrying weapons. There's no aggressive intent being shown."</TE>

<HD>Rebel War Leaks Beyond Colombia's Borders</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Nation's neighbors report encounters with
FARC guerrillas since the collapse of peace talks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TIBU, Colombia</DL>
<LD>Colombia's leftist guerrillas have begun infiltrating neighboring
countries since the collapse of peace talks in February, threatening
to further destabilize an already unsteady region.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities in Brazil, Peru and Ecuador have reported encounters
in recent weeks with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,
which goes by the Spanish initials FARC.</LD>
<LD>   But the most serious incident so far happened a few miles north of
this outpost on the border between Venezuela and Colombia. In late
March, at least 300 FARC rebels clashed with a Colombian military
squad, leaving 41 dead--about half of them on each side.</LD>
<TE>   Colombian military officials and local people said the FARC
launched part of the attack from inside Venezuela. Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez, who recently overcame an attempt to oust him,
denied the accusation, but people on the Venezuelan side of the
border say the Colombian rebels have long had a presence there.</TE>
<TE>   The incursions come at a delicate time for the region. In Peru,
President Alejandro Toledo faces a surge in terrorism and planting of
drug crops. Brazil is in the midst of a turbulent election year.</TE>
<TE>   Venezuela also is facing political upheaval. Last month, top
military officers forced Chavez to resign before he turned the tables
and returned to power just a few days later.</TE>
<TE>   Incidents along the border began shortly after Colombian President
Andres Pastrana declared an end on Feb. 20 to a special peace zone in
southern Colombia that had served as a de facto headquarters and
training ground for the FARC, the largest guerrilla army in Latin
America.</TE>
<TE>   FARC leaders ordered small squads of rebels streaming out of the
Switzerland-sized region to avoid capture, according to Colombian
military officials, sending the guerrillas out across the swampy
plains that make up this country's interior.</TE>
<TE>   The maneuver was apparently successful. Despite intense military
operations in the former zone, no FARC leaders have been captured and
few of the estimated 8,000 rebels there have been killed.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the guerrillas fled to neighboring countries, Colombian
military officials believe. It is not clear whether they are seeking
to establish permanent bases or are temporarily regrouping.</TE>
<TE>   The first signs of trouble came in early March, when Brazilian
police fought a gun battle with FARC members attempting to recruit
indigenous groups, according to a Brazilian diplomatic source.</TE>
<TE>   A week later, Ecuadorean military officials found an abandoned
FARC camp in Sucumbios province on the border with Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   Peruvian authorities have said that since the peace talks in
Colombia ended, more than half a dozen FARC members have entered Peru
near its border with Colombia to resupply themselves. Another FARC
member was reportedly arrested on his way to Lima, the Peruvian
capital.</TE>
<TE>   But the most violent clash took place here in Catatumbo, a lawless
region of thick jungle, soaring mountains and coca fields on the
border between Colombia and Venezuela.</TE>
<TE>   Catatumbo sits in a broad valley between two mountain ranges--one
in Colombia and one in Venezuela--which has become prime territory
for growing coca. The region registered one of the biggest gains in
Colombia last year in the growth of coca, the source of cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   The area has become a battleground in recent years between the
FARC and Colombia's right-wing paramilitaries, both of which finance
their war with drug profits.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, authorities reported that as many as 60 people, many of
them civilians, were killed in clashes between the FARC and
paramilitary groups in an isolated corner of northwestern Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   David Mosquera, the acting governor of Choco state, said the
casualties occurred Thursday and early Friday as the two sides
battled for control of the region around the village of Bojaya. He
said some of the civilians were killed when FARC rebels fired
homemade mortars into a church Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   In Catatumbo, in the northeast, more than 30 people have
disappeared or been killed since the beginning of the year, according
to one local estimate.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel squeezed by all sides," said Taiz del Pilar Ortega, the
town's mayor. "We are worried that things are going to get even
worse."</TE>
<TE>   Colombian military officials believe that a large group of between
500 to 800 rebels who left the former peace zone arrived in this area
in early March to join an existing unit, the FARC's 33rd Front.</TE>
<TE>   When the reinforcements arrived, military officials say, the 33rd
Front began an offensive against the paramilitaries, who had taken
control of most of the region's coca trade.</TE>
<TE>   On March 15, they gathered local residents, mostly small coca
farmers, and declared that no vehicle could enter or leave the area.
They set fire to eight cars and buses in the following days, and
locals began fleeing.</TE>
<TE>   They also burned residents' identity cards in an apparent effort
to prevent them from voting in presidential elections this month. The
leading candidate, Alvaro Uribe, says he will increase military
spending and take a harder line toward the FARC.</TE>
<TE>   The action prompted the local Colombian military battalion to
begin a search for the guerrillas. On March 20, they found them just
outside El Milagro, half a mile from the Venezuelan border.</TE>
<TE>   For four hours, according to the local military commander, his
group battled about 300 rebels, some of them teenagers and women. The
rebels retreated to the Venezuelan side of the border and began
launching homemade mortars built from gas cylinders. The mortars were
responsible for most of the 21 army deaths, the local commander said.</TE>
<TE>   The commander, who spoke on condition he not be identified, called
in an AC-47 gunship for airstrikes, but the Colombian air force pilot
refused to shoot because the rebels were in Venezuela.</TE>
<TE>   "I was screaming at him, 'Brother, hey, shoot them, shoot them,' "
said the commander, his voice rising. "If he had just done that, the
battle would have been different."</TE>
<TE>   Local peasants back up at least part of the military commander's
version. They say they noticed an increase in FARC rebels in early
March.</TE>
<TE>   "They use the frontier strip because it makes it much easier for
them to move," said Jairo Gomez, head of a local farmers union.</TE>
<TE>   In La Fria, a tiny Venezuelan town just over the border, ranchers
said that guerrillas had been crossing into Venezuela for decades.
Among eight men and women talking inside a regional ranchers
association hall, four had had family members kidnapped or killed by
Colombian guerrillas in the past 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   But the number of guerrillas jumped dramatically after the end of
the peace process, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no government in this area," said Andres Querales, a
veterinarian. "There is tremendous impunity. They'll kill one of our
employees, take our money, and nothing happens."</TE>
<TE>   The local Venezuelan military commander said that he cannot be
sure whether the guerrillas launched the March attack from Venezuela.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Wilfrido Cruz, who is responsible for the Venezuelan side of
the Catatumbo region, said that he had flown over the area in search
of guerrillas the day after they had fought the Colombian military,
but had found no sign of them or any guerrilla base. Since the border
is not clearly marked, the guerrillas could have mistakenly entered
Venezuela, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But he also said he could not rule out Colombia's accusations.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be possible," Cruz said. "It's an open frontier. But
what is important is that any armed actor found on our side of the
border, guerrilla, paramilitary, whatever, will be pursued by our
forces."</TE>

<LD>At Slobodan Milosevic's war crimes trial in The Hague, Kosovo's
provincial president, Ibrahim Rugova, accused the former Yugoslav
president of unleashing a brutal campaign of "ethnic cleansing" in
Kosovo in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Rugova, who led a campaign of passive resistance by Kosovo's
ethnic Albanian majority against Milosevic's rule in the 1990s,
blamed the Serbian massacres of ethnic Albanians on Milosevic.</LD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>OLDHAM, England</DL>
<LD>Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party suffered minor losses in
local elections across England, while a right-wing extremist group
won two city council seats for its first victories in nearly a
decade.</LD>
<LD>   The elections Thursday, just days after an impressive showing in
France by right-wing candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen, were Labor's first
ballot test since its landslide general election victory last year.
Opposition parties had hoped to capitalize on dissatisfaction with
the country's rising crime and faltering public health and
transportation systems.</LD>
<LD>   David John Edwards and Carol Hughes, both running under the banner
of the British National Party, won in Burnley, one of four cities in
northwestern England hit by racial riots last year. Officials were
recounting votes in a third district of Burnley where another BNP
candidate was running.</LD>
<TE>   Both victors thanked voters for the rightist BNP's first electoral
victory since 1993, but their success drew heavy criticism.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the election results were not as bad as Labor had feared,
with the opposition Conservative Party making only modest gains. The
governing party often loses some seats in local midterm elections.</TE>
<TE>   The elections were held for almost 6,000 seats on 174 local
councils across Britain. Two years ago, Blair's government lost
ground to the Conservative Party during a similar vote.</TE>

<DH>Age-old ghosts, believed to inhabit every nook of society,
hold potent sway. Exorcists can help ease believers' anxiety-- for a
price.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>More than 1,000 years after the death of samurai Masakado Taira,
executives, homemakers and multinational corporations still worship
and appease his vengeful ghost. Each day, residents leave food,
mementos and money at his stone monument, wedged between skyscrapers
in Tokyo's financial district.</LD>
<LD>   "As far as I know, he's the only ghost in Japan with his own bank
account, which is now worth around $190,000," Masakado Preservation
Society Chairman Tatsuzo Endo said. "That said, I'm not really sure
ghosts need money."</LD>
<LD>   A few miles away, spirits of a lesser pedigree are said to haunt
the 70-year-old residence of the prime minister, site of a bloody
coup attempt in 1932. For two decades, premiers refused to live
there.</LD>
<TE>   Even recently, some residents have complained of shadowy military
figures skulking around the courtyards. As late as 2000, then-Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori spoke of funny crawling sounds at night, door
handles moving by themselves and strange problems with the electrical
system. Last month, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi moved into a
newly built residence, and Japanese are waiting to see if the ghosts
follow.</TE>
<TE>   "All of Japan is one big ghost home," said Hitomi Yuki, a psychic
who prefers direct contact but in a pinch will perform exorcisms over
the Internet. "Sometimes I see so many, I have to avoid them or just
zigzag around."</TE>
<TE>   The flip side of Japan's belief in several hundred gods and at
least two major religions is an equally rich and varied nether world.
Spirits traipse the archipelago in forms ranging from deformed,
tormented humans to quirky animal-like critters--one explanation,
some say, for Japan's deep-seated love of animation, Pokemon and
cutesy characters.</TE>
<TE>   Belief systems are always difficult to quantify, but scientists
and folklore experts say ghosts tend to exert far greater sway over
the Japanese than over Westerners. Tokyo has 100 designated haunted
sites visited by summer bus tours, and ghost themes are almost as
omnipresent on Japanese television as police dramas are in the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas American ghosts tend to appear around Halloween, their
Japanese counterparts like the summer heat, especially mid-August,
when people traditionally clean their ancestral graves. And whereas
Western children tend to worry about seeing spooks under the bed,
Japanese ghosts are more likely to be found in damp places,
especially the toilet.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese ghouls also tend to show up during times of
uncertainty--and have impressive staying power. Take the ghost of
Taira, an imperial wannabe who died in 940 after losing a nasty power
struggle.</TE>
<TE>   In 1872, his ghost threatened to wreak havoc on Tokyo just as the
samurai class was losing its power. Only a visit by the emperor to
Taira's former spiritual haunt calmed things down.</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of a massive earthquake that destroyed much of
Tokyo in 1923, a plan to put up a government building on Taira's
memorial site was scrubbed after a minister and 13 senior officials
died under mysterious circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   In 1940, the 1,000-year anniversary of Taira's death, the Finance
Ministry, a short distance from the site, was struck by lightning and
burned to the ground. And after World War II, the U.S. military
dropped its idea for a parking lot on the site after a bulldozer
operator suddenly died. Some even blame Taira for the 1998 bankruptcy
of the Long-Term Credit Bank after the institution sold the land
under his monument.</TE>
<TE>   Today, employees at neighboring Mitsui Trading Co. still refuse to
sit with their backs to his shrine, fearful of showing disrespect.</TE>
<TE>   Few writings or artwork depict the earliest Japanese ghosts, but
folk art experts suggest that they were friendly, nonthreatening and
closely related to ancestor worship.</TE>
<TE>   Buddhism's spreading influence after the 6th century changed the
hoary landscape, cultural historians say. Ghosts became scarier,
reflecting a moral battle between good and evil.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's transition from a relatively simple rural society to a
complicated urban court life of back-stabbing and petty jealousies by
the 10th century is also reflected in the ghost world. "Japanese
ghosts are increasingly linked to social ills rather than natural
disasters," said Haruo Suwa, a literature and folklore professor at
Gakushuin University.</TE>
<TE>   One of the first recorded home-grown ghost stories appeared around
1100 in Japan's seminal Buddhist text, "Konjaku Monogatari," when a
low-ranking samurai dumps his wife for another woman. He soon has
second thoughts and returns to sleep with her only to realize, on
seeing her shriveled body in the morning, that he's slept with her
ghost.</TE>
<TE>   As Japan entered the warring samurai period of the Middle Ages,
ghosts became more straightforward and less concerned with social
niceties. While there had always been some before, the vast majority
of ghosts become female around this time, a reflection, experts say,
of a feudal society that held women down and left them more likely to
bear a grudge.</TE>
<TE>   Sometime around the 17th century, Japanese ghosts lost their legs,
a change attributed by some to evidence of hellish torment and by
others to the influence of Kabuki, where actors' legs are hidden
beneath ornate kimonos.</TE>
<TE>   Recent televised ghost tales find wandering spirits in cell
phones, DNA and the Internet. "Mysterious phenomena never die even
though society modernizes," said Hideo Hanabe, a lecturer at
Kokugakuin University.</TE>
<TE>   No matter where they lurk, Japanese spirits generally fall into
two broad categories. Those in human form, known as yurei, tend to be
angry, emotionally complex and closely aligned with humans. Another
world of strange animal shapes or half-human forms is known as yokai.
These little characters abide by no particular logic and tend to be
associated with places rather than people.</TE>
<TE>   Noted author and comic illustrator Shigeru Mizuki says he draws
much of his inspiration from their antics. As a Japanese Imperial
Army soldier posted in Papua New Guinea during World War II, Mizuki
says he was beaten by his commanding officer for wandering off in
search of foreign yokai. "What kind of idiot soldier are you?" he
recalls being asked.</TE>
<TE>   The way Mizuki sees it, the whimsical yokai and the grudge-bearing
yurei represent two sides of the Japanese spirit. Unfortunately, he
says, the playful side linked to village life has all but lost out to
the serious, stress-filled yurei world of bustling cities and harried
businessmen.</TE>
<TE>   A society without frivolity is fundamentally unhealthy, he said.
"The yokai aren't coming around much anymore," he said. "Japan is
losing its soul."</TE>
<TE>   Japanese culture places a premium on wa, or group harmony. The
most powerful ghosts, therefore, reflect its opposite, a world of
tortured souls who have angrily left the group of the living. In the
Japanese context, it's far less important what spurred the ghosts'
anger or whether it was justified than the imputed lack of consensus
behind it, say ghost and folklore experts.</TE>
<TE>   "Japan's real religion is wa," said Motohiko Izawa, managing
director of the Mystery Writers Assn. of Japan. "The ultimate aim is
to keep the wa so that powerful, grudge-laden ghosts don't appear."</TE>
<TE>   This inordinate fear of grudges explains why Japanese appease
their enemy's spirits, no matter how dastardly their deeds in life,
Izawa added. A notable example is the careful burials given to 13th
century Mongols who died trying to invade.</TE>
<TE>   The job of appeasing ghosts has traditionally fallen to Buddhist
priests, who exorcise by clacking their beads and chanting sacred
passages, often in return for sizable contributions. Sending the
ghouls to infect someone else is no good, however. Ideally, the holy
men help the tortured souls move on to a higher plane, out of humans'
way.</TE>
<TE>   "I talk to them until they're convinced to leave," said Mudo Oda,
a monk with the 1,300-year-old Enkoji Temple in Atsugi City.</TE>
<TE>   In modern times, psychics have moved in on the action. Yuki, who
charges $400 per appointment, said most of her exorcisms can be done
in one sitting. Clients possessed by hundreds of powerful ghosts,
however, may require several sessions.</TE>
<TE>   "People can have up to 100 million ghosts inside," she said,
wearing a red dress and bright red lipstick in a room with red
curtains, red cushions and a red table. "My rates are reasonable.
Some other psychics charge by the ghost."</TE>
<TE>   While most psychics try not to speak ill of their competitors, the
elbows can get pretty sharp. "All those psychics appearing on
television are 100% fake," said Sadao Mori, a psychic based in Aichi
prefecture who charges a monthly $140 ghost-service retainer. "I'm
the only real one in Japan."</TE>
<TE>   In the tiny town of Tomika, ghost-bedeviled contractor Tadanori
Tanaka took a practical approach when it came to assessing would-be
exorcists. "It was hard for me to choose which psychic was powerful,"
he said. "So the first question I'd ask them is, 'How much?' "</TE>
<TE>   The problems at his 24-unit apartment building started the day
after he moved in back in 1999. The curtains moved by themselves, and
the footsteps of nonexistent children could be heard overhead, always
running in the same direction, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors soon chimed in with their own experiences--including
flying plates, possessed hair dryers and levitating rice cookers. As
word spread that the structure was built on an ancient, very bloody
battlefield, the town was inundated by national media, onlookers and
more than 30 psychics.</TE>
<TE>   One psychic who asked for $160,000 to solve the problem was sent
packing. Another agreed to do it for $400 but had to refund the money
when the ghosts failed to disperse. And one borrowed the possessed
hair dryer and never returned it. "Maybe he needed it," Tanaka said.
"He had pretty nice-looking hair."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the haunted residents agreed to let another psychic,
Yoshiko Shimo, give it a go. She arrived with 15 monks in tow, and
after three days of almost nonstop chanting managed to drive away the
spirits, at least to the satisfaction of residents. And she never
asked them for money, Tanaka said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so great to finally have our lives back again," he said,
sitting in his exorcised living room.</TE>
<TE>   As you might expect, the Japanese public's unworldly appetite for
all things ghostly has given rise to abuses. In one of many such
incidents, police in Kanagawa prefecture early this year arrested a
54-year-old man on charges of defrauding hundreds of victims. His
scam involved accosting people outside train stations, telling them
that ghosts were choking them and then relieving them of thousands of
dollars in purification fees.</TE>
<TE>   Yoshihiko Ohtsuki, a physics professor at Waseda University, has
spent two decades debunking ghost stories and poltergeist tales.</TE>
<TE>   Ohtsuki says the multibillion-dollar Japanese psychic industry
does a huge disservice by leading astray gullible young people.</TE>

<HD>Israel Raids Nablus; Church Food Deal Collapses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli tanks and troops invaded the largest city in the West Bank
again Friday, while in Bethlehem a deal to get food to Palestinians
inside the besieged Church of the Nativity broke down, dashing brief
hopes of a breakthrough to end a monthlong standoff.</LD>
<LD>   In Nablus, the five-hour raid targeted explosives depots and
operatives of the radical Hamas movement, the army said. Three
people--an Israeli officer, a Hamas activist and a Palestinian
policeman--were killed when Israeli forces surrounded a building and
came under fire, the army said.</LD>
<LD>   In Bethlehem, as Greek Orthodox Palestinians marked a somber Good
Friday, Palestinian officials who have served as mediators prepared
to deliver food to the Church of the Nativity under what they
believed to be a deal with the army. Inside, the more than 100
civilians, gunmen and Palestinian police eagerly awaited the
delivery.</LD>
<TE>   But the deal broke down after Israeli military officers insisted
that the negotiators provide a list of the people inside, according
to the Palestinians. Army officials declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   "The arrangements took all morning, and we thought it was all
set," said Salah Tamari, a mediator.</TE>
<TE>   The food deal had been arranged in the first Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations in days involving the standoff, and it fed expectations
that the crisis could soon be resolved. But late Friday, pessimism
had replaced such hope.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened today does not encourage us to go on," Tamari said.</TE>
<TE>   Israel has made it clear that it intends to continue operations
like the Nablus incursion. Despite U.S. demands that the Israeli
military withdraw from West Bank territory it occupied during its
recent offensive, the army has pulled its troops and tanks to the
outskirts of Palestinian cities, establishing forward bases for
launching raids at will.</TE>
<TE>   Diplomats here say the tactics essentially have wiped out the
concept of "Area A," territories in the West Bank that are under full
Palestinian control under terms of the 1993 Oslo peace accords.
Holding sovereign territory is key to rebuilding the Palestinian
Authority in the aftermath of Israel's West Bank offensive, diplomats
say.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of these incursions may be attached to intelligence that the
Israelis receive, but my guess is that some are based on making the
point that 'we can do this' and trying to establish a baseline for
future action," a Western diplomat said Friday.</TE>

<HD>Future of Jenin Lies in the Rubble</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Some want the camp left in ruins as a memorial,
but others seek to rebuild.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JENIN, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Mahmoud Hammad spends his days perched on a 5-foot-high pile of
rubble, shaded by a tattered piece of cloth.</LD>
<LD>   It is hot. Bulldozers rumble nearby. The air is filled with a
thick dust that carries the cloying smell of rotting flesh.</LD>
<LD>   But it is his home. And he wants it back.</LD>
<TE>   "I have to be here. This is my house. This is where I live. Our
family is here. Our history is here," said Hammad, a 75-year-old
whose leathered face makes him look far older.</TE>
<TE>   As the residents of this city's devastated refugee camp struggle
to put their lives back together, a debate has erupted about whether
to rebuild.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian leaders here believe that the camp, once home to
13,000 refugees, should be left in ruins, a reminder to the world of
what they label Israeli brutality.</TE>
<TE>   On the other side are the Palestinians who live around the camp's
main square, which was razed by armored Israeli bulldozers. Human
Rights Watch says at least 140 apartment buildings were
destroyed--about 10% of the camp's total, including nearly all the
structures around the square. About 4,000 people were left homeless.</TE>
<TE>   Of more than a dozen refugees interviewed in recent days, all
vehemently rejected the idea of moving away from the camp that has
been their home for decades.</TE>
<TE>   For some, rebuilding is a matter of pride; for others, it reflects
their attachment to the place. And still others fear becoming
rootless again. The camp was founded in 1953 to hold Palestinians who
fled their homes during Israel's 1948 War of Independence.</TE>
<TE>   "My grandfather was a refugee, my father was a refugee. I'm not
going to be a refugee again," said Mahmoud Khanfer, whose ruined
apartment sits in a damaged building a few hundred yards from the
central square. "Everyone should return to their same home in the
same place."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli soldiers entered the camp last month in part because a
number of suicide bombers who have attacked Israeli civilians had
come from the area. The Israelis encountered fierce resistance as
they approached the square April 9, losing 13 soldiers in an ambush
in the courtyard of an apartment building nearby.</TE>
<TE>   After that, military planners decided that the only safe way to
proceed was by using bulldozers and tanks to level the buildings that
jammed against each other around the square and that created a
dangerous maze of narrow alleys.</TE>
<TE>   It was not the first time that Jenin had been destroyed by an
occupying force. In 1938, British soldiers controlling the region
flattened much of the city after Palestinians killed the local
military governor.</TE>
<TE>   Pictures of shattered buildings from that attack hang on the wall
in City Hall, a blurry and distant reminder of the destruction. Mayor
Walid abu Mwais wants a more vivid testament to the current
devastation.</TE>
<TE>   Mwais is leading the movement to leave the camp as is, a lunar
landscape crawling up a hill in painful steps of twisted steel and
concrete.</TE>
<TE>   The recent battle in Jenin already has become one of mythic
proportions among Palestinians, an Alamo where outnumbered and
outgunned fighters stood until the last man against the Israeli army.
The Israeli army says 23 of its soldiers were killed in the
offensive.</TE>
<TE>   This is combined with the strong belief among Palestinians that a
massacre occurred in the camp. Though they have charged that between
300 and 500 civilians were killed during the battle, the Palestinians
have so far recovered 53 bodies. A Human Rights Watch report released
Friday found that less than two dozen of those were civilians and no
evidence that there had been a massacre.</TE>
<TE>   "The horrific destruction is proof for all generations. It's the
only proof we have," Abu Mwais said. "We want to show how innocent
Palestinian civilians made a stand in front of one of the mightiest
military powers in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Abu Mwais wants to build new and better apartments next to the
camp, with the help of donor countries.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, many of the Palestinians whose homes were destroyed are
living in nearby rented homes paid for by the Palestinian Authority,
the municipality and the United Arab Emirates.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians reportedly have turned down an offer from an
Israeli Arab group to rebuild homes in the camp, saying they want the
residents to eventually decide how best to memorialize their
suffering.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli government "wants to hide the crime forever. We must
let [the destruction] remain to show everybody what has happened,"
said Mohammed abu Gabi, the director of the local government
hospital, who favors leaving the camp in ruins.</TE>
<TE>   The decision on whether to rebuild is in the hands of a local
committee, according to Abu Mwais. While it debates, however, locals
complain that construction is being delayed, prolonging their misery.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole idea is to rebuild what we had before," said Ahmed
Kassan, the assistant director of the camp, who has been left with a
pair of bulldozers to clean up the rubble from the invasion.</TE>
<TE>   The residents interviewed Thursday explained that the camp is
their home. Over the years, it had become a small city of multistory
apartment buildings and other permanent structures.</TE>
<TE>   Hammad, for instance, has been allowed to live in an apartment
outside the camp to compensate the 75-year-old for the loss of his
home. But he goes there only to sleep. He insists on spending his
days on top of his old home with his wife and family.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the camp sits more proof of the refugees' desire to stay
put. There, about 64 pale green United Nations tents sit in a former
field. All are empty.</TE>
<TE>   Although the U.N. plans to use the tents to house refugees, locals
said they prefer to stay with friends and family in buildings in the
camp that remain habitable.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those also insisted that they would not move into
permanent homes, even if they were better homes next to the present
camp.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if they build us castles on the outside, I don't want to
move. This is our home," said Abdul Kharim Saadi, 26, who was wounded
in the fighting and lost a brother.</TE>
<TE>   Few of the refugees saw the need for a monument. Their suffering,
they said, was memorial enough.</TE>
<TE>   "We died to keep it, and we will live to keep it," said Jamal
Tawalbeh, 47. His English limited, he struggled to voice his
opposition to the idea of leaving the camp. "Everyone saw what
happened. All the world saw the crime on TV."</TE>
<TE>   Down the street, residents pointed to another memorial. In a
converted cafeteria, town residents lined up to pay their respects to
the father of Mahmoud Tawalbeh, a Palestinian fighter killed in the
city when he was hit by a helicopter rocket. To get into the
cafeteria, they had to walk up a small wooden ramp. It was covered
with a mud-stained Israeli flag.</TE>
<TE>   On the walls and shops lining the streets, posters have sprung up
with pictures of the Palestinian men killed during the fighting--new
dead to inspire the city's youths.</TE>
<TE>   Jenin's most striking memorial might be felt in coming years,
predicted some Palestinians, as members of the younger generation
grow up with dreams of becoming gunmen or even suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   "In every demolished house, the Israelis have created more
volunteers to become martyrs" for the Palestinian cause, said Abu
Mwais, the mayor. "The Israelis have destroyed every hope of peace."</TE>

<HD>A S. African Native's Homecoming</HD>
<DH>History: Remains of a Khoisan woman who was exhibited as a
freak in European sideshows in the 1800s are returned  from France.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa</DL>
<LD>The remains of Saartjie Baartman, a native Khoisan woman exhibited in
Europe nearly two centuries ago as an ethnological and sexual freak,
were returned Friday to South Africa amid celebration.</LD>
<LD>   "We're proud to welcome her back where she belongs and hope that
she will be buried in a spirit of reconciliation," Andries le Fleur,
paramount chief of the Griquas, a subgroup of the Cape Town region's
Khoisan people, said at an emotional "homecoming" ceremony.</LD>
<LD>   A wooden box containing Baartman's preserved brain, sexual organs
and skeleton was draped in a South African flag and flanked by six
Khoisan children as it was wheeled into the Cape Town airport
building where local dignitaries waited to pay their respects.</LD>
<TE>   A rug of antelope and zebra skins was rolled out in Baartman's
honor. A group of Khoisan chanted, sang and played traditional
instruments.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of returning Baartman's remains from Paris hailed the
move as a triumph of the human spirit and a significant step toward
restoring dignity to indigenous people worldwide. The Khoisan,
considered the original inhabitants of Africa's southern tip,
suffered atrocities at the hands of successive colonial rulers.</TE>
<TE>   "The return of Saartjie Baartman is going to give rise to the
rediscovery of the pride of the Khoisan people," said Petrus Marais,
premier of Western Cape province, who is also of Griqua heritage.
"This is not the coming of one person--it is the coming of a nation."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a victory for human rights," said Griqua leader Sammy
Jansen. "Now that we have gotten her back, we are very satisfied."</TE>
<TE>   The Khoisan consist of two ethnic groups, the Khoikhoi and the
San. Thousands of Khoisan died of smallpox or were displaced
following the arrival of Dutch settlers in the 17th century.</TE>
<TE>   Typically honey-colored in complexion, most Khoisan were absorbed
into the so-called colored population under South Africa's
apartheid-era system of racial classification.</TE>
<TE>   Of curiosity to Europeans in Baartman's day were her large
genitalia and protruding buttocks, anatomical characteristics
particular to the Khoisan--who were derogatorily referred to as
"bushmen" or "Hottentots."</TE>
<TE>   Khoisan leaders said they hoped that publicity about Baartman's
ordeal would serve as a lesson to future generations to ensure that
such mistreatment is never repeated. They would also like her story
to ignite a continent-wide drive to have other elements of Africa's
lost heritage repatriated.</TE>
<TE>   A delegation led by Brigitte Mabandla, South Africa's deputy
minister of arts, culture, science and technology, went to Paris to
collect Baartman's remains, which will be stored at a military
mortuary until an appropriate burial is arranged. Mabandla said a
monument probably will be built.</TE>
<TE>   Baartman was born near the Gamtoos River valley in the eastern
Cape region in 1789. In 1810, a British navy doctor convinced her
that she could make a fortune displaying her body to curious
Europeans, and he took her to London.</TE>
<TE>   "She was taken, not against her will, but under false pretenses,
by unscrupulous men," said Dr. Willa Boezak, national chaplain for
the Khoisan community.</TE>
<TE>   Dubbed the "Hottentot Venus," Baartman was paraded around Britain
at circus sideshows, museums, bars and universities. Considered to be
part animal, she was kept in a cage and made to sing and dance in
public, as people paid to gawk at her.</TE>
<TE>   Marilyn Martin, director of art collections at Iziko Museums of
Cape Town, said European scientists used Baartman's figure to
perpetuate vulgar stereotypes about race and African sexuality and to
support claims that blacks were inferior.</TE>
<TE>   "People like Saartjie would have been relegated to the very bottom
of the evolutionary ladder," Martin said. "Europeans had decided what
was the acceptable civilized norm."</TE>
<TE>   The British press and the anti-slavery movement at the time fought
in court for Baartman's release, but the case was thrown out when she
testified that she was in London of her own free will. She also told
the court that she was happy, which Khoisan leaders believe was a
lie.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can put ourselves in her shoes as a lonely woman at the
mercy of these men, Saartjie had to put up with a lot from these
people just to survive," said Boezak, the chaplain. "It was a
strategy of survival."</TE>
<TE>   Baartman was later taken to Paris for exhibition. Historians say
she drifted into prostitution and died in poverty in 1816.</TE>
<TE>   "We suspect that her untimely death at such a young age was partly
[due to] psychological [issues]," Boezak said.</TE>
<TE>   Mystery still surrounds the fate of two children Baartman is said
to have had with a West Indian man she married in England.</TE>
<TE>   After her death, a French surgeon made a mold of her body. Her
brain and genitalia were bottled as specimens for scientific study,
while the painted plaster cast of her body was displayed at the
Museum of Mankind in Paris until 1974. It was then stashed in a back
room, along with her remains.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, representatives of the South African government and the
Khoisan initiated talks with France about returning her remains for
burial.</TE>
<TE>   In January, a French senator took up Baartman's cause. Her remains
being the legal property of the state, it took a special act of
Parliament to allow them to be returned to South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that an historical injustice has been righted," Boezak said,
"she has become a symbol of freedom for our women."</TE>

<HD>Backers Await Activist's Release</HD>
<DH>Myanmar: Officials have met with Aung San Suu Kyi in recent
days, perhaps to negotiate an end to her 19-month house arrest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BANGKOK, Thailand</DL>
<LD>Supporters of Aung San Suu Kyi were hopeful Friday that the Nobel
Peace laureate and leader of democracy forces in Myanmar would soon
be set free after 19 months under house arrest.</LD>
<LD>   Speculation has been rife in Yangon, Myanmar's capital, that the
charismatic Suu Kyi could be released within weeks or even days as
the nation's military rulers seek to end more than a decade of
international isolation.</LD>
<LD>   Military leaders, who blocked Suu Kyi's party from taking power
after it swept parliamentary elections in 1990, have met with her in
recent days, apparently to negotiate the terms of her release.</LD>
<TE>   It is unclear, however, whether the regime is seeking to impose
restrictions that would be too onerous for Suu Kyi to accept, such as
limits on her ability to travel around the country.</TE>
<TE>   Suu Kyi, 56, is one of the world's foremost democracy advocates
under arrest. When other Nobel Peace Prize winners gathered last
December in Norway for a peace symposium, she was conspicuously
absent.</TE>
<TE>   The United States, other nations and international aid groups have
imposed sanctions on Myanmar that have contributed to the country's
economic stagnation in the last decade. The government's willingness
to consider freeing Suu Kyi indicates its interest in securing
outside help. "They realize they are in trouble economically and they
have to do something," said one Yangon-based diplomat, who requested
anonymity. "They need a lot of help, and they are not going to get it
if she is not released."</TE>
<TE>   The government apparently was so close to freeing her this week
that it began tidying up the street leading to her lakeside
residence. Officials of her party, the National League for Democracy,
predicted that she would be released within days.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. special envoy Razali Ismail, a Malaysian who has spearheaded
negotiations between Suu Kyi and the regime, said after a trip to
Myanmar late last month that he expected a breakthrough soon.</TE>
<TE>   However, negotiations for her release appeared to stall in recent
days.</TE>
<TE>   "Initially, the government may have had a plan to release her,"
one supporter said. "But reading the signs, it seems that Suu Kyi may
not agree with the conditions imposed by the government."</TE>
<TE>   One sticking point may be the military's reluctance to free 1,800
political prisoners, many of whom are affiliated with her party. She
has called for their release in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Since late last year, the government has released about 200
prisoners. It said Friday that five more will be freed.</TE>
<TE>   "The release is very slow," said Aung Zaw, a magazine editor who
lives in exile in Thailand. "Five is kind of a joke. People are
hoping for a big breakthrough. If we go at this rate, we will have to
wait another 10 or 20 years for everyone to be released."</TE>
<TE>   The military took power in a 1988 coup and ruthlessly crushed
democracy demonstrations. The regime changed the name of the country
from Burma to Myanmar and the name of the capital from Rangoon to
Yangon.</TE>
<TE>   Suu Kyi, the Oxford-educated daughter of Burmese independence
leader Aung San, was kept under house arrest from 1989 to 1995. She
won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   After her release, she was prohibited from leaving Yangon. In
August 2000, she attempted to leave the city and was stopped by
police. Refusing to turn back, she camped in her car for days by the
side of the road before she was again placed under house arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Today, soldiers guard her house, her telephone line has been cut
and barricades keep visitors away.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Says Iraq Is Developing Banned Arms</HD>
<DH>Weapons: Satellite photos provide evidence of long-range
missiles, Washington declares. Meanwhile, Baghdad continues push to
get sanctions lifted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>U.S. officials have presented U.N. Security Council members with what
the Americans say is new evidence that Iraq is developing long-range
missiles in defiance of international sanctions, diplomats here said
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. also has reached agreement with Russia on a long list of
items of potential military use that Iraq will no longer be allowed
to import, the diplomats said. An American-backed council resolution
imposing the new trade controls on Iraq is expected to be introduced
within a few days, they said.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, after three days of inconclusive talks with U.N.
officials here, Iraqi officials called for further negotiations on
the possible return of weapons inspectors to their country. Iraqi
Foreign Minister Naji Sabri and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
used the same wording to describe their discussions--"useful and
frank"--and said they hope to meet again within a month.</LD>
<TE>   Annan said Iraq is still seeking guarantees from the council that
if it complies with the world body's inspection demands, sanctions
will be lifted, the United States and Britain will end their
enforcement of "no-fly" zones over northern and southern Iraq
and--most important--there will be no punitive military action
against the Persian Gulf country.</TE>
<TE>   Annan said he noted Iraq's concerns in a meeting here Friday with
the council, which has in the past reiterated its insistence on the
readmission of U.N. weapons inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. diplomats, meanwhile, said they believe that recent
intelligence briefings they gave here have helped convince council
members and U.N. officials that Iraq is not bargaining in good faith.</TE>
<TE>   In private meetings with council members two weeks ago, U.S.
officials showed satellite photographs and documents that they said
provide fresh evidence of an Iraqi project to build missiles with a
range far beyond the 100-mile limit stipulated in binding U.N.
resolutions after Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   The unpublicized presentations were given first to the other four
permanent Security Council members--Russia, China, France and
Britain--and later, during a three-hour luncheon meeting at the
Norwegian ambassador's residence, to the 10 rotating members.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was persuasive, but I'm not a specialist," said Ole
Peter Kolby, Norway's representative to the U.N. and the host of the
gathering. Kolby said in an interview that the photographs depicted
what James B. Cunningham, the U.S. deputy representative, told them
were long-range missile parts and missile-launching installations.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that these pictures were what they said they were,"
Kolby said.</TE>
<TE>   Two other U.N. diplomats, who requested anonymity, confirmed the
account of the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   After the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the United Nations sent
inspectors into Iraq looking for evidence that the Iraqis were
developing nuclear, chemical and biological arms, as well as missiles
capable of delivering such weapons.</TE>
<TE>   After inspectors complained that their access to known and
suspected military facilities was being blocked, and the Iraqis
charged that U.N. monitors were committing espionage for U.S.
intelligence agencies, the inspectors left Iraq in December 1998.
Days later, U.S. and British warplanes launched punitive bombing
strikes.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi army defectors and exiled opposition leaders have alleged
since then that Iraq continues to try to build ballistic missiles
capable of sending conventional or nuclear warheads to targets as
distant as Tel Aviv. The U.S. satellite photos are said by Western
diplomats to corroborate some of the defectors' accusations.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials confirmed accounts of the recent briefings but
declined to give further details about the photographs and
intelligence reports they presented. They also requested that their
names not be used, as is common in diplomatic circles.</TE>
<TE>   They said they believed council members were "impressed" by the
presentations, increasing skepticism about Iraq's intentions here.</TE>
<TE>   American and British diplomats also have asserted in U.N.
committees in recent months that Iraq has routinely circumvented the
world body's export controls through the undeclared shipment of crude
oil by pipeline to Syria and subverted import constraints by
illegally diverting heavy trucks and other goods to the military.</TE>
<TE>   Other diplomats, though convinced that the new U.S. evidence is
credible, were less certain of its impact on council members who have
urged continued dialogue with the regime of Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a question of waiting, and seeing, and we just don't know
yet," said a British diplomat, who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   But Russia, long a caustic critic of U.S. and U.N. policies toward
Iraq, has agreed to a detailed catalog of hundreds of products--from
radio scanners to laboratory equipment to infrared binoculars--that
Iraq would no longer be able to import without specific prior U.N.
approval, Western diplomats said. The agreement was reached after
months of U.S. negotiations with Russia, which since the imposition
of sanctions a decade ago has been Iraq's biggest supplier of
advanced industrial equipment.</TE>
<TE>   List of Restricted Goods Part of New Sanctions</TE>
<TE>   In the next few days, diplomats here say, the United States and
Russia will jointly propose a Security Council resolution that would
make the list of restricted goods the cornerstone of a new sanctions
system that would go into effect next month.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Russian delegation could not be reached Friday
night to confirm the agreement. In November, when it extended the
present sanctions regime for another six months, the council endorsed
in principle its replacement with a streamlined and toughened system
of import controls. But the main stumbling block to its
implementation was Russia's objections to the proposed new controls
on specific products that it had been providing to Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Although the new resolution is almost certain to be opposed by
Syria, the Arab bloc's current representative on the council, Western
diplomats say they expect support from all veto-wielding permanent
members and most of the rest of the 15-member body.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean that the Security Council has suddenly embraced
the Bush administration's Iraq policy, however.</TE>
<TE>   The Russians, with arm's-length French and Chinese support,
recently have revived demands that the Security Council give Iraq a
clear timetable and explicit conditions for the eventual end of
sanctions if Baghdad agrees to admit inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   And should Iraq refuse again to let them in, the Russians contend
that military action against Baghdad would still require the consent
of the Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   "It is our position that any nation that decides to use force, not
in self-defense, should seek the approval of the United Nations,"
Sergei V. Lavrov, the Russian ambassador to the world body, told
reporters here last month.</TE>
<TE>   Britain, the one constant U.S. ally in the council and in the
skies over Iraq, has guardedly welcomed Iraq's recent diplomatic
gestures, while Washington has remained scornfully skeptical. Polls
in Britain show a growing majority oppose U.S. military action
against Iraq, with opposition increasing sharply if British troops
were to be engaged.</TE>
<TE>   "[British Prime Minister] Tony Blair may be ready for war with
Iraq, but the British public is not," said a senior U.N. official,
who asked not to be named.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, there is scarcely a diplomat to be found outside the U.S.
mission here who speaks favorably--privately or publicly--about the
Bush administration's military threats against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Most U.N. members say they agree that Iraq should admit weapons
inspectors. Yet it is only the threat of American military action,
many diplomats here acknowledge privately, that has led Iraq to
reconsider its opposition to the U.N. arms monitors.</TE>
<TE>   As was evident when Iraq announced last month that it was cutting
off its oil exports to protest Israel's military campaign against the
Palestinians, it is increasingly clear here that economic pressure
alone--through U.N. trade controls or other means--is unlikely to
force policy change in Baghdad, much less bring a new regime to
power. This expensive political gesture has already cost Iraq as much
as $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq Wealthier Than Most of Its Neighbors</TE>
<TE>   But while Iraq's standard of living has fallen below the levels of
other big Persian Gulf oil producers, the country remains wealthier
than most of its neighbors. After a decade of political isolation and
trade sanctions, Iraq's per-capita income was still about 10% higher
than it was in 1990, thanks to petroleum earnings, and considerably
above the average incomes of Syria, Turkey, Jordan and Iran.</TE>
<TE>   Staple foods, medicine and other civilian goods have become more
readily available after Iraq and the U.N. agreed to a revised
sanctions plan in 1996. Since then, all declared earnings from Iraq's
oil exports--now totaling more than $52billion--have been deposited
in a special U.N. account. About a quarter of these funds are set
aside to settle claims against Iraq from Kuwait and to underwrite the
U.N.'s enforcement expenses--including the costs of its weapons
inspection unit.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the rest of the money is slated for imports of civilian
goods, ranging from food and medicine to machinery and replacement
parts for oil rigs. A U.N. office has approved $32 billion in
contracts for "humanitarian supplies and equipment" since 1996,
though just $19.6 billion has been delivered.</TE>

<HD>U.S., Russia Cite Progress on Arms Cuts</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Bush, Putin hope to sign a deal on nuclear
weapons this month, but Powell says differences remain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. and Russian officials claimed progress Friday toward a nuclear
arms deal, yet after a day of talks they failed again to complete the
agreement the two nations' leaders hope to sign at a Moscow summit in
three weeks.</LD>
<LD>   After a session with Russian Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov,
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said some sticking points remain,
and he acknowledged that the deal might not be complete in time for
the hoped-for summit signing.</LD>
<LD>   Powell said that if the agreement is completed in time, "fine....
If we are unable to, the work will continue.</LD>
<TE>   "Remaining differences are there," he added, "and we are going to
have to spend time and continue discussing them."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, Ivanov met with President Bush at the White
House. The foreign minister was slightly more upbeat than Powell,
saying the Russian side believes that there is a "very high
probability" that the signing will occur May 23 as planned.</TE>
<TE>   Late Friday, Bush told reporters at Camp David in Maryland: "We've
been spending a lot of time with Russia to reach an agreement.... The
secretary of State is optimistic. There's some work that remains to
be done. I'm looking forward to ... working closely with President
[Vladimir V.] Putin."</TE>
<TE>   The negotiations are being closely watched as a test of the new
U.S.-Russian relationship, and many analysts in both countries are
confident that some kind of deal--perhaps a partial one--will be
signed this month.</TE>
<TE>   The key questions are how much ground the stronger United States
will cede to get a deal, and to what extent the agreement will
restrain the two sides in the management of their offensive nuclear
arsenals.</TE>
<TE>   Bush declared last year that he intends to reduce the offensive
U.S. arsenal from more than 6,000 operationally deployed warheads to
between 1,700 and 2,200 in 10 years, and he called this a major step
away from the Cold War rivalry. The Russians have said they intend to
reduce their inventory to about 1,500 deployed warheads.</TE>
<TE>   But the two have clashed over the U.S. insistence that it be
allowed to keep some of the decommissioned warheads in storage,
rather than destroying them, to have them available in case of an
unexpected new threat.</TE>
<TE>   Critics in Russia and elsewhere say that shifting missile and
submarine warheads to warehouses--rather than destroying them--would
make the downsizing far less significant than claimed.</TE>
<TE>   The Russians cannot afford the upkeep of their nuclear arsenal and
are going to face an appreciable decline in their capability no
matter what deal is reached.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts believe that the Bush administration will not give
way on the idea of this reserve inventory but will try to accommodate
the Russians to a degree by providing some information on its size
and composition. In the jargon of arms control, the deal will offer
some "transparency" and "verifiability," they predict.</TE>
<TE>   The Russians also want the agreement to tie the size of each
country's offensive arsenal to its defensive capabilities. The
Russians would like to have the political grounds to argue later that
if the U.S. develops a missile defense shield, as the Bush
administration hopes to do, it would have to further limit its
offensive arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   That issue apparently remains in play, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Still unclear is whether the agreement will take the form of a
treaty or an executive order, Powell said. A treaty would require
approval of two-thirds of the Senate, which could be hard to come by
because of expected criticism from liberals and conservatives alike.
An executive agreement, in contrast, could be approved with support
from only half the members of the House and Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Bush originally pressed to have only a verbal understanding. His
concession on this point earlier this year has been taken as a sign
of his desire to reach an agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be useful at this point for President Bush to be able to
point to a tangible accomplishment in the new relationship that he's
building with President Putin," said Karl F. Inderfurth, a former
State Department official now with the Elliott School of
International Affairs at George Washington University. "For the same
reasons, it would be useful for President Putin to point to an
accomplishment with ... Bush."</TE>

<HD>Rift Runs Deep in Water War</HD>
<DH>Irrigation: Imperial Valley district plans to reline canal
to prevent seepage--runoff that Mexican farmers rely upon for their
crops.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL and TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>MEXICALI, Mexico</DL>
<LD>Farmer Bernardo Gonzalez has tilled the Mexicali Valley for more than
half a century, but he says he's never had a harvest as bitter as the
one he fears he'll reap soon: crops withered by their loss of
precious Colorado River water.</LD>
<LD>   The leathery but still agile 82-year-old is caught in the currents
of an international water dispute that could leave him and 2,500
other Mexican farmers in Baja California high and dry, one of an
increasing number of conflicts that characterize U.S.-Mexico border
water policy.</LD>
<LD>   "We're afraid of what might happen," said Gonzalez, who has worked
his 45 acres since 1937, when Mexican President Lazaro Cardenas gave
him expropriated land. "This is one of the most valuable farms around
here. But it won't be if they put cement in the canal."</LD>
<TE>   He's referring to the All-American Canal, which since 1944 has
transported water from the Colorado River westward into California's
Imperial Valley, helping turn a desolate and arid wasteland into a
$1-billion-a-year farm economy.</TE>
<TE>   The canal's operator, the Imperial Irrigation District, says it
will soon begin a project to reline a porous 23-mile section of the
canal, converting it from clay to concrete. That would save the vast
amounts of water lost to seepage but would devastate Gonzalez and the
other farmers who have come to depend on it for ground water.</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican government isn't taking the plan lying down. Mexican
authorities, from Baja Gov. Eugenio Elorduy to Cabinet members, have
complained to the U.S. government to stop the project, so far to no
avail. Mexico says it violates a 1944 water accord that calls on the
United States to consult with Mexico on any project that affects
water supplies.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department and an international body meant to settle
water disputes between the U.S. and Mexico have said California is
legally entitled to line the canal. And whereas officials in
California are unwilling to back down from the lining project, they
have discussed the possibility of "good faith" projects on the U.S.
side of the border to increase the quantity and quality of Colorado
River water that Mexico gets.</TE>
<TE>   Loss of Water Poses a Serious Threat</TE>
<TE>   The stakes are high. Seepage totaling as much as 2% of all the
water transported from the Colorado River to the Imperial Valley has
brought prosperity to the northeast Mexicali Valley, which is what
the Imperial Valley is called south of the border. Losing it would
create economic, social and environmental problems, Baja officials
warn.</TE>
<TE>   "We are concerned with any possibility of significant reduction of
what we receive from the Colorado River," Mexican Foreign Minister
Jorge Castaneda said Friday. "That's where we get our water from."</TE>
<TE>   Castaneda's advisor on binational water issues, Ambassador Alberto
Szekely, said in an interview this week that Mexico is about to step
up the pressure to have the project stopped or changed.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, Mexico started efforts to initiate diplomatic
consultations, and the effort will be pressed more intensively in the
short term," Szekely said.</TE>
<TE>   The leaks from the canal easily filter down through the sandy
earth east of Calexico and into the aquifer. For 58 years, the
high-quality water--meaning low in salts--from the All-American Canal
has bathed Gonzalez's farm and those of his neighbors. The water has
made this part of the Mexicali Valley Mexico's most productive
farmland after the Rio Grande Valley south of Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Yields of wheat, alfalfa and cotton on Gonzalez's farm, 300 yards
from the U.S. border, are up to 50% higher than the rest of the
Mexicali Valley, which doesn't benefit from the canal seepage. That
productivity, coupled with low-cost Mexican farm labor, has also
attracted scores of U.S. farmers who rent large parcels here and grow
an assortment of crops.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez and other farmers receive the canal water from private
wells and from the 425 wells that the Mexican government has sunk
into the area to catch the seepage. That well water is then
distributed by irrigation canals over about 50,000 acres of farmland.</TE>
<TE>   The Imperial district, the largest irrigation district in the
United States, has talked for years about lining the more porous
parts of the canal with concrete. But plans never advanced, partly
because of plentiful supplies of Colorado River water--and because of
Mexico's adamant claim that the subterranean water is rightfully
theirs.</TE>
<TE>   The district has never conceded the Mexican claim, and, in fact,
language in the 1944 water agreement is vague about who owns
subterranean water, merely requiring both sides to consult any time
one side's actions might affect the other.</TE>
<TE>   Juan Pablo Hernandez, Baja's agricultural development secretary,
said no such consultation or negotiation has occurred.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say whether the United States has acted unilaterally in
other border water disputes, but that is what is happening here,"
said Hernandez, who is also a Mexicali Valley farmer.</TE>
<TE>   Alfonso Cortes, a researcher in water policy at the College of the
Northern Border in Mexicali, says the "unilateral decision" to line
the canal is one of the most serious ground-water issues facing the
United States and Mexico and would alter farming throughout the
Mexicali Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "This project will cause many conflicts and social damage," he
said. "More than 30,000 people live in this area, and what will
happen to their livelihoods? What will happen to their drinking
water?"</TE>
<TE>   California officials say that the lining project violates neither
the letter nor spirit of the binational water agreement and that
asking Southern California not to line the canal so that the water
can continue to seep out and aid the Mexicali Valley is asking too
much.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, the irrigation district has paid for the water that
Mexican farmers are using, state officials said, according to a
formula under the 1944 treaty. The agreement calls for Mexico to
receive 1.5 million acre-feet of water, roughly one-third of what
California gets.</TE>
<TE>   "They're getting the benefit of water that we've already been
charged for," said Dennis Underwood, Colorado River specialist with
the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. "We should be
inefficient [and not line the canals] because we want to help our
neighbor?"</TE>
<TE>   That position is supported by the El Paso-based International
Boundary and Water Commission, which has arranged for discussions
between Southern California and Mexican water officials over lining
the All-American Canal.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had discussions on the lining of the All-American Canal
over a period of years," spokeswoman Sally Spener said. "Certainly
it's been our view that the U.S. is within its rights."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials note that along with receiving its full allocation
under the 1944 treaty, Mexico also receives about 200,000 acre-feet a
year because of problems with a storage facility in Imperial
County--water that, like the canal seepage, they say belongs to the
U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Discussions between the U.S. and Mexico over the lining issue have
stalled amid an acrimonious dispute between the two countries over
the Rio Grande. But California officials insist they are willing to
resume discussions.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal has to be: How do we improve your position while
protecting our own?" said Maureen Stapleton, general manager of the
San Diego County Water Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Pressure From the U.S. Government</TE>
<TE>   After years of discussions, the Imperial district is now going
ahead full throttle with plans to line the All-American Canal and
will soon issue a request for bids. The district has come under
increased pressure to reduce its Colorado River usage or to produce
water savings by relining the canal or through other methods,
including leaving some of the half a million acres of Imperial Valley
farmland fallow.</TE>
<TE>   That pressure is coming from the U.S. government, which has
ordered California--which is perceived as a water hog--to cut back so
that Arizona and Nevada can have more Colorado River water.</TE>
<TE>   Pressure is also coming from California, which has urgent water
needs in urban areas because of population and industrial growth and
has been looking to buy extra water from the Imperial district. The
district controls 75% of the state's allocation of the Colorado
River.</TE>
<TE>   The district has also been enticed by a deal to sell excess water
to water-short San Diego County for hundreds of millions of dollars,
although the deal has yet to be finalized and is facing political
opposition and a possible court challenge from environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, many California officials now deem the canal's lining
a foregone conclusion. The Legislature has budgeted $125 million to
reline the 23-mile section, with completion set for 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Tomas Martinez Saldana, a professor at the College of
Postgraduates in Chapingo, Mexico, and a water expert, says the
Mexicali Valley dispute is an example of the border water problems
that have grown as population and industrial growth have boomed.</TE>
<TE>   Oddly, as water problems have become more acute, cross-border
cooperation has, if anything, lessened, professors Martinez and
Cortes said.</TE>
<TE>   "There have always been disputes and always will be. But both
nations should review water treaties that are decades old and are no
longer relevant," Martinez said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Gonzalez and his family face the uncertain prospect of
his land becoming arid and unproductive. Said Bernardo's son Carlos,
who works the land with him: "Without that water, we'll be left with
nothing. If there is no water, there is no life."</TE>

<HD>Jobless Rate Rises to Highest Since 1994</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The nation's unemployment rate unexpectedly jumped to a nearly
eight-year high of 6% last month, a sign that the full economic
recovery may be longer in coming and slower to help the jobless than
previously thought.</LD>
<LD>   The April rate rose from March's 5.7% pace as Americans flooded
into the work force at a far faster pace than the economy created
jobs, the Labor Department said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Better than half a million more people began looking for work last
month, expanding the nation's labor force to a record 142.6 million,
according to department statistics. But U.S. employers created a mere
43,000 new jobs in April. And even that number was suspect as the
government lowered earlier- reported job gains for February and
March.</LD>
<TE>   "The figures show the economy is still growing but only
moderately," said Lynn Reaser, chief economist of Banc of America
Capital Management in St. Louis. "The pace of job formation remains
very subdued."</TE>
<TE>   The 6% jobless rate was the highest since August 1994 and
represented a substantial turnabout from the four-decade low of 3.9%
that the country enjoyed just 18 months ago. Now, 8.6 million
Americans are unemployed, about 3.1 million more than when the
country hit the low in October 2000.</TE>
<TE>   A substantial fraction of last month's jump in joblessness was
among women and whites, according to Labor Department statistics. The
jobless rate for adult women rose 0.4 percentage point from March to
5.4%, while the rate for whites increased 0.3 percentage point to
5.3%. Most months, the two rates barely budge.</TE>
<TE>   The jobless rates and increases for Latino and African American
workers were substantially higher, although department officials said
the numbers represent a smaller fraction of the overall work force
and tend to vary widely. The Latino unemployment rate rose 0.6
percentage point to 7.9%. The African American rate increased 0.5
percentage point to 11.2%.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the jobless rate jumps, analysts found some encouraging
signs in the April statistics.</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturing, which had been shedding more than 100,000 jobs a
month from the start of the recession in March 2001 through January,
lost only 19,000 last month. The temporary-help industry, which
during the same period shed more than 600,000 jobs, or nearly 20% of
its total, added 66,000 in April, its third straight month of job
gains.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the fact that so many people have begun looking for
work, even if they have yet to find it, is a plus.</TE>
<TE>   "It signals people who had given up and dropped out of the work
force are back," said William Cheney, chief economist with John
Hancock Financial Services Inc. in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks slumped and the dollar hit its lowest point since October
against the euro as investors interpreted the new jobless numbers to
mean a slower economic recovery and a weaker-than-expected rebound in
corporate profit.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite index tumbled 31.79 points, or 1.9%, to
1,613.03. For the year, the tech-laden index is off 17%, reflecting
continued trouble in the computer and telecommunications industries.</TE>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 skidded 11.13, or 1%, to 1,073.43,
bringing its year-to-date loss to 6.5%. The Dow Jones industrial
average fell 85.24, or 0.8%, to 10,006.63, down 0.2% from where it
began the year.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar, which steadily strengthened against other major
currencies during the last seven years, skidded 1.6% against the euro
Friday and 0.7% against the Japanese yen.</TE>
<TE>   Decline of Dollar Raising Concerns</TE>
<TE>   The dollar's slippage in recent weeks has prompted concerns that
international investors, who have relied on the dollar as a safe
haven, may be having second thoughts amid continued tensions in the
Middle East and signs of a weak recovery at home.</TE>
<TE>   Although a slow decline in the dollar's value would be a boon to
U.S. manufacturers and therefore good for the American economy, most
currency adjustments are abrupt and disruptive.</TE>
<TE>   "People should be careful what they wish for in this area," said
Edwin M. Truman, a former senior Treasury and Federal Reserve
official. "Once one of these things get going, they can be hard to
stop."</TE>
<TE>   The new jobless report came only four days before the Fed's
policymaking Federal Open Market Committee meets Tuesday, and
analysts said the committee was likely to reinforce its decision to
leave interest rates at a 40-year low.</TE>
<TE>   "This was not a jobs report that would panic any fence-siting
member of the FOMC" into raising interest rates, said Joel L. Naroff,
a Holland, Pa., economic consultant. "Indeed, it's just another
reason for the Fed to continue to wait and watch."</TE>
<TE>   That's because the report showed a slowdown in wage growth that,
though painful for American workers, reduces the already minimal
danger of renewed inflation and therefore removes the need for the
Fed to increase rates to protect against a new price spiral.</TE>
<TE>   Earnings for Most Increase Slightly</TE>
<TE>   According to the report, average hourly earnings for
nonsupervisory workers, who account for about 80% of the U.S. labor
force, increased 2 cents in April from March to a seasonally adjusted
$14.69.</TE>
<TE>   Labor Department officials described April's job gain of 43,000 as
"essentially flat" and said it marked the third straight month in
which the country's employment total remained basically unchanged.
Officials revised their previous estimates that the economy created
58,000 new jobs in March and 66,000 in February. They now believe it
lost 21,000 in March and 4,000 in February.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the temporary-worker industry, others that added workers
last month were restaurants and bars (31,000), transportation
(18,000) and health care (15,000).</TE>
<TE>   The biggest job loser was construction, a sector in which payrolls
dropped by 79,000. But analysts discounted the significance of the
loss, saying it was largely the product of heavier-than-usual hiring
earlier in the year because of the unusually warm winter.</TE>

<HD>Oracle Pact May Have Violated Law</HD>
<DH>Scandal: Lockyer says deal broker's role representing both
the state and software firm may have been a conflict.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN and NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>As state officials pressed to rescind an embarrassing $95-million
computer contract with Oracle Corp., Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer said
Friday that a major government contractor that helped broker the deal
may have violated state law by representing both the state and the
software company.</LD>
<LD>   Oracle spokesman Jim Finn reaffirmed the company's offer to
rescind the deal, and both Lockyer and Gov. Gray Davis said Friday
they are working to do so.</LD>
<LD>   "Unfortunately," Davis said, "people made a bad judgment for the
taxpayers of California. I do not want that to stand."</LD>
<TE>   In separate comments, Davis offered his first detailed response to
the Oracle deal. The governor said he had no knowledge that it was in
the works in mid-2001, and that there was no connection between
Oracle's $25,000 donation to his campaign and the state's decision to
sign the apparently overpriced software contract.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said he is "acting decisively," having removed three top
officials who oversaw the deal, including Arun Baheti, a longtime
Davis aide who resigned Thursday as director of e-government. Baheti
accepted the $25,000 check from Oracle lobbyist Ravi Mehta last
spring and sent it via overnight mail to the Davis campaign
committee.</TE>
<TE>   Davis also suspended Elias Cortez with pay as director of the
Department of Information Technology, after the state Department of
Justice began investigating document shredding in the agency
responsible for protecting the state from computer debacles.</TE>
<TE>   A third official, Department of General Services Director Barry
Keene, resigned last week.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is, I'm as mad as anyone else," Davis said. "This
shouldn't happen on anyone's watch. We're going to get to the bottom
of it."</TE>
<TE>   With legislative oversight hearings set to resume Monday,
political pressure continued to build. Davis' general election
opponent, Republican Bill Simon Jr., referred to a "scent of scandal"
emanating from the deal. He called on the legislative committee
investigating the matter to elicit testimony from Davis' top
political strategist, Garry South--an idea that the committee
chairman dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to rescind the Oracle contract are complicated by the fact
that other companies are involved, including Logicon, the Northrop
Grumman subsidiary that Lockyer believes may have had a conflict of
interest, and Koch Financial Services, which helped arrange
financing.</TE>
<TE>   Logicon said it would "work with the appropriate parties to find a
mutually agreed upon resolution" if the state and Oracle agree to
rescind the deal. "We have a long and successful history with the
state of California and consider the state a valued customer."</TE>
<TE>   A Koch representative declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The state's first payment on the $95-million contract--$14
million--is not due until Sept. 1.</TE>
<TE>   In his preliminary review, Lockyer said Logicon may have violated
state conflict-of-interest law by representing both Oracle and the
state during the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   A state audit released last month says Logicon played dual roles,
working for both the state and Oracle. The auditors said they could
not determine whether any state officials understood that Logicon
stood to gain a $28-million profit from the Oracle agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Information Technology hired Logicon in June
2000 to advise it on signing large-scale computer deals, called
enterprise licensing agreements. The state had never signed such a
contract, which permits buyers to use database software in many
different ways on a large scale.</TE>
<TE>   But by February 2001, Logicon had shifted roles. It was acting as
a "reseller," a company that packages hardware and software products
of several companies to meet a customer's needs. And no longer an
advisor to the state, the company began pitching California officials
on the merits of enterprise licensing agreements.</TE>
<TE>   Though noting that the investigation is at an early stage, Lockyer
said: "They were serving two masters. They were working for the state
and at the same time secretly working for Oracle, without knowledge
of state officials that that was the circumstance, as far as I can
tell. That raises more serious questions for them."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Logicon called its role "open and acknowledged by
the state officials involved."</TE>
<TE>   "The company believes it has acted appropriately and in good faith
in all aspects of this transaction," the statement said. "While we
have not had the opportunity to review the attorney general's
comments, we believe he will come to the same conclusion when all the
facts are known."</TE>
<TE>   Top aides to Davis say they were unaware of Logicon's dual role.
However, Cortez, the suspended information technology director who
pushed for the deal, had hired Logicon to help arrange large computer
software deals of the type it later struck with Oracle.</TE>
<TE>   "Oracle is doing what every business does: peddling their
products," Lockyer said Friday. "And then you have the Logicon role,
where they were serving at least two masters, and that involves
conflict law. They were advising the state on how to get good
contracts, and then secretly working for Oracle, and got a bonus if a
contract was signed. So they had a conflict that seems serious."</TE>
<TE>   Moving to limit fallout from the week's events, particularly the
revelation that a high-level government employee had accepted a
contribution to the governor's campaign, Davis' aides distributed his
policy forbidding government appointees from getting involved in
fund-raising, as Baheti did.</TE>
<TE>   At his news conference, Davis said he had "no idea what [Baheti]
was doing, why he was doing it. It came to a complete surprise to
me."</TE>
<TE>   Simon juxtaposed Baheti's acceptance of the campaign donation with
comments last week by Davis Press Secretary Steven Maviglio that
administration officials responsible for the contract "would be in no
position to know about contributions, nor should they be."</TE>
<TE>   "We now know that the governor's office is not telling the truth,"
Simon said. "The dots are beginning to connect."</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer called Baheti's decision to take the money "stupid." But
he also said Baheti violated no law merely by accepting the check.
Though it's illegal to pass campaign donations at the Capitol, Baheti
apparently took the check at a restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department investigators said they will continue to
interview Department of Information Technology officials on Monday
about the shredding of documents this week.</TE>
<TE>   Federal agents already had seized the department's computer hard
drives and 12 sacks of trash, including papers that apparently were
shredded Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   At his news conference, Lockyer said that if any of the shredded
documents related to the Oracle contract, there could be an array of
crimes, ranging from obstruction of justice and destruction of state

<TE>   Lockyer also said he has received no indication that Cortez was
present when any papers were destroyed. Nor is he aware of anyone
ordering that documents be destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer and Davis both are Democrats. But the attorney general
brushed aside Republican lawmakers' call for him to step aside and
shrugged off criticism that he too had taken Oracle contributions:
$50,000 since 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Our office is accustomed to professionally investigating
wrongdoing," Lockyer said. Responding to a reporter's question about
criticism of him for taking money from Oracle, Lockyer quipped: "I
was wishing there was more."</TE>

<HD>U.S. May Still Get a Shot at Pluto Mission</HD>
<DH>Budget: Sen. Barbara Mikulski calls launch a $500-million
bargain and seeks to restore funds. Timing is crucial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hopes for a mission to Pluto, canceled by NASA officials for budget
reasons weeks ago, are rising again with a senator's new vow to find
money to pay for the trip.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), who heads the appropriations
subcommittee controlling the NASA budget, called the $500-million
mission a bargain and said that canceling it would be missing a
historic opportunity.</LD>
<LD>   She made her comments this week as NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe
offered NASA's 2003 budget to her committee.</LD>
<TE>   Mikulski said she was disappointed to see a flat $15-billion NASA
budget and continued cost overruns at the International Space
Station. The agency should be spending more money to improve space
shuttle safety, repair an aging launch infrastructure and conduct
additional space missions--including the one to Pluto--Mikulski said.</TE>
<TE>   A mission to Pluto--the only unexplored planet in the solar
system--has been a repeated victim of the NASA budget. In the fall of
2000, a JPL mission to explore Pluto and the distant Kuiper Belt was
canceled after its cost doubled to $800 million. The same year, NASA
made plans to travel to Pluto for $500 million but canceled funding
the next year.</TE>
<TE>   After a massive letter-writing campaign mounted by supporters of
the mission, including schoolchildren, and a push to restore a
mission to Pluto by the Pasadena-based Planetary Society, Congress
added $30 million to NASA's 2002 budget at the last minute. The funds
were earmarked for the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins
University, in Mikulski's home state, to continue planning the
mission.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the lab needs $122 million to start building the
spacecraft, but the budget offers nothing. The only hope for the
mission now is for Congress to restore the funding, which Mikulski
said she would do. ''She doesn't want to miss the boat, or in this
case, the rocket,'' said her spokeswoman, Amy Hagovsky.</TE>
<TE>   ''We're the undead,'' said Alan Stern, a Pluto expert at the
Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., who is the project's
lead scientist. Though relieved by the news, Stern said the mission
will be touch and go until the budget is finalized this year.</TE>
<TE>   Still, his team is continuing to push forward with engineering and
design of the spacecraft and mission. ''We can't be tentative about
this,'' he said. ''It's 44 months to launch.''</TE>
<TE>   The scientists are racing to launch by 2006 because that is the
last time for a decade they will be able to use Jupiter's gravity to
boost the spacecraft toward Pluto. They would like to reach the
planet, about 3 billion miles away, by 2020.</TE>
<TE>   Pluto is moving farther from the sun and many scientists think its
atmosphere may freeze completely and be unavailable for study after
2020, though the timing is still being debated.</TE>
<TE>   Stern also said that Pluto's extreme tilt means that one
hemisphere will be in total darkness and unavailable for imaging if a
spacecraft does not reach it soon.</TE>
<TE>   NASA officials said recently that they did not think a 2006 launch
was possible because it can take up to eight years to get approval to
launch spacecraft that use plutonium to power their electronics.</TE>
<TE>   Stern also said his team was developing a backup plan to launch in
2007 and "go direct" without using Jupiter. After that, he said the
planetary lineup would make the trip impossible without a new kind of
propulsion system.</TE>

<HD>FBI Agent Warned of Arabs' Training</HD>
<DH>Terror: Bureau was alerted last summer. It was considering
canvass of flight schools when attacks occurred.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The summer before the Sept. 11 attacks, the FBI in Arizona alerted
Washington that several Arabs were suspiciously training at a U.S.
aviation school and urged that agents nationwide contact other
schools where Middle Easterners might be studying.</LD>
<LD>   The FBI sent the intelligence in July 2001 to its terrorism
experts for analysis and was considering a nationwide canvass of
flight schools when the suicide hijackers struck, officials told
Associated Press.</LD>
<LD>   The bureau had not yet alerted other federal agencies, such as
those that handle pilot licenses or immigration visas, although its
Phoenix office recommended sharing the information, officials
concede.</LD>
<TE>   "FBIHQ should discuss this matter with other elements of the U.S.
intelligence community and task the community for any information
that supports Phoenix's suspicions," an Arizona counterterrorism
agent recommended in a July 2001 memo to FBI headquarters that was
obtained by Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   At least one leader of the 19 hijackers, Hani Hanjour, received
flight training in Arizona, but his name had not surfaced with the
Arizona FBI memo, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   None of the information in the Arizona memo pointed to the suicide
plot that leveled the World Trade Center and killed thousands in New
York, Virginia and Pennsylvania, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "None of the people identified by Phoenix are connected to the
Sept.11 attacks," said FBI Assistant Director John Collingwood.</TE>
<TE>   "The Phoenix communication went to appropriate operational agents
and analysts, but it did not lead to uncovering the impending
attacks."</TE>
<TE>   Officials said FBI counterterrorism agents in Phoenix were
suspicious about several Arab men seeking airport operations,
security information and pilot training.</TE>
<TE>   The Arizona agent who wrote the memo recommended that the FBI
compile a list of flight schools nationwide, instruct local field
offices to make "appropriate liaison" with the schools and begin
alerting local offices when Middle Eastern nationals sought new visas
for flight training at local aviation schools.</TE>
<TE>   "FBIHQ should consider seeking the necessary authority to obtain
visa information from the USDOS [State Department] on individuals
obtaining visas to attend these types of schools and notify the
appropriate FBI field office when these individuals are scheduled to
arrive in their area of responsibility," the memo said.</TE>

<KH>Verdict: The 41-year-old man faces up to 15 years in prison
for killing a pregnant woman and three others after a drinking binge.</KH>
<HD>Ex-Officer Convicted in Deaths of Four</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A former police officer was convicted of manslaughter Friday for
killing a family of four with his minivan after a 12-hour drinking
binge that started in a precinct parking lot.</LD>
<LD>   Joseph Gray, 41, admitted drinking as many as 13 beers before the
fatal accident on Aug. 4 but contended he was still OK to drive.</LD>
<LD>   Gray sat motionless as the jury returned its verdict.</LD>
<TE>   He faces up to 15 years in prison at sentencing May 23.</TE>
<TE>   Gray had pleaded not guilty in the deaths of Maria Herrera, 24,
who was eight months pregnant; her 4-year-old son, Andy; and her
sister, Dilcia Pena, 16.</TE>
<TE>   Gray was also charged with the death of Herrera's baby boy, who
was delivered after the accident but also died.</TE>
<TE>   Gray testified that he drank all day after an overnight shift,
beginning in the police parking lot and continuing at a Brooklyn
strip club that was off limits to 72nd Precinct officers.</TE>
<TE>   He said he felt OK to drive that night and that he was not drunk.
Gray's blood-alcohol content was measured at 0.16, well over the
legal limit of 0.10. Prosecutors contend he drank 18 beers that day.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Harold Levy conceded that Gray was driving while
intoxicated but claimed his client's high alcohol tolerance gave him
the "ability" to drive.</TE>
<TE>   "As hard as it may be to swallow, that's all he's guilty of," Levy
said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Gray was traveling at least 50 mph and ran a red
light before hitting the victims as they crossed a well-lighted
street.</TE>
<TE>   Gray, who has three daughters, said he was driving 30 mph and had
a green light when the victims walked out from the shadows and into
the path of his minivan.</TE>
<TE>   "It's terrible to say to the Herrera and Pena families, but your
family members, in part, were responsible for what happened," Levy
said during closing arguments Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Maureen McCormick said the victims were returning from
a shopping trip when they were cut down. She called Gray arrogant.</TE>
<TE>   "The evidence shows he was flat-out drunk," she said.</TE>
<TE>   After the accident, Gray resigned after 15 years on the police
force.</TE>
<TE>   Police officials also transferred, suspended or modified the job
descriptions of 17 officers from the precinct. Three were later
fired.</TE>

<HD>Searchers to Hunt for JFK's WWII Boat in Pacific Depths</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW HAVEN, Conn.</DL>
<LD>The undersea explorer who found the Titanic will search the Pacific
Ocean around the Solomon Islands for the remains of PT-109, John F.
Kennedy's World War II boat.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Ballard plans to use remote cameras to look for the 80-foot
wooden-hulled patrol torpedo boat that Kennedy commanded. National
Geographic is aiding the search, set for this month.</LD>
<LD>   It may prove a difficult task. PT-109 sank on Aug. 2, 1943, after
it was cut in half by a Japanese destroyer. Two members of Kennedy's
crew died in the collision. The young naval officer and 10 other
survivors swam 15 hours to reach an island.</LD>
<TE>   Kennedy pulled an injured crewmate to safety by swimming with a
strap from the man's lifejacket in his teeth. They later swam to
another island, where Kennedy carved a message into a coconut and
gave it to a native islander to bring to rescuers.</TE>
<TE>   Ballard said PT-109 is "not lost, just misplaced, but it's like
looking for a coffin from an airplane in a zone where they've dumped
a lot of unexploded ordnance. It's no fun."</TE>
<TE>   A film and magazine article on the expedition are planned as part
of a presentation on the 60th anniversary of World War II battles in
the Pacific.</TE>

<HD>Pipe Bombs Explode in Mailboxes</HD>
<DH>Midwest: Six devices, accompanied by antigovernment
letters, detonate, injuring five. People are told not to open boxes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Six pipe bombs, placed in mailboxes along with an antigovernment
letter exploded in rural communities in Illinois and Iowa Friday,
injuring six people, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The bombs were each set to go off when the door to the mailbox was
opened, U.S. Postal Service and law enforcement officials said. None
of the injuries was considered life-threatening.</LD>
<LD>   "We are reviewing this as a domestic terrorism incident," said FBI
spokesman James Bogner. "We don't know if all the devices have been
found or if there are devices remaining....We probably won't know for
a while."</LD>
<TE>   As word of the bombings and the letter, signed by "Someone Who
Cares," began spreading later in the day, local postal and police
officials implored residents not to open their mailboxes and pulled
mail carriers off their routes. Mail delivery was suspended through
the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want kids getting off the bus and opening the mailbox, or
people coming home from work and opening their mailbox," said Carroll
County, Ill., Sheriff Rod A. Herrick. "Don't touch your mailbox until
further notice."</TE>
<TE>   Eight devices were found, including the six that detonated. All
the bombs appeared similar in design and were battery-powered,
authorities said. Each bomb was accompanied by a single-spaced,
typewritten letter in a plastic bag, with a rambling, antigovernment
manifesto warning that "more 'attention getters' are on the way."</TE>
<TE>   "Mailboxes are exploding! Why, you ask?" the letter began.
"Attention people. You do things because you can and want (desire)
to. If the government controls what you want to do, they control what
you can do."</TE>
<TE>   Later in the note, it said: "Conforming to the boundaries, and
restrictions imposed by the government only reduces the substance in
your lives. When 1% of the nation controls 99% of the nations [sic]
total wealth, is it a wonder why there are control problems?"</TE>
<TE>   The final paragraphs read: "If I could, I would change only one
person, unfortunately the resources are not accessible. It seems
killing a single famous person would get the same media attention as
killing numerous un-famous humans. There is less risk of being
detained, associated with dismissing certain people."</TE>
<TE>   After signing off as "Someone Who Cares," the writer added: "P.S.,
more info. will be delivered to various locations around the
country."</TE>
<TE>   The first bomb appears to have gone off in Mount Carroll, Ill., in
the northwest corner of the state, 140 miles northwest of Chicago,
said post office Vice President Azeezaly Jaffer. About 11 a.m., a
letter carrier opened a mailbox, apparently triggering the explosion.</TE>
<TE>   The chronology of the other explosions is unclear, but bombs went
off in Morrison, Ill., 20 miles away; Asbury, Iowa; Tipton, Iowa; and
Elizabeth, Ill. The longest distance between any of the towns is 78
miles, between Asbury and Tipton.</TE>

<LD>Former first lady Lady Bird Johnson was in stable condition after she
suffered a mild stroke and lost her ability to speak, her doctor
said.</LD>
<LD>   "We are still not sure how permanent this is or how severe this
is," Dr. Rodney Horton said. The stroke is at least the second for
the 89-year-old Mrs. Johnson since 1993. "It does appear that she has
lost the power of speech."</LD>
<LD>   Mrs. Johnson was taken to a hospital Thursday afternoon after she
awoke from a nap at her home and had trouble speaking and swallowing
medication. Her doctor said she appears to have suffered damage to a
small area on the left side of her brain.</LD>
<TE>   "At the present time, she is fully understanding of everything
that is being said, can nod appropriately, but she is unable to find
the word," Horton said.</TE>
<TE>   Luci Baines Johnson said her mother was alert Friday.</TE>

<HD>Court Upholds EPA Rules on Clean-Burning Diesel</HD>
<DH>Pollution: Clinton-era effort to cut fumes from trucks and
buses is embraced by Bush.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>For decades, as the government has cracked down on car pollution,
heavy trucks and buses have been allowed to belch noxious fumes from
dirty diesel fuel. But diesel's special status, protected through
relentless lobbying, moved close to extinction Friday.</LD>
<LD>   A federal appeals court, discarding challenges by the nation's oil
companies and a major diesel engine manufacturer, upheld
Environmental Protection Agency rules aimed at forcing trucks and
buses to clean up.</LD>
<LD>   The regulations, among the few initiated by the Clinton
administration and embraced by the Bush administration, require
manufacturers of heavy trucks and buses to cut 95% of the harmful
pollutants from tailpipes of diesel vehicles by the 2007 model year.
They also mandate a 97% reduction in the sulfur in the diesel fuel
that powers the vehicles.</LD>
<TE>   Thousands of early deaths and hundreds of thousands of cases of
chronic and acute bronchitis and asthma attacks will be avoided each
year, EPA officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "Now all Americans will receive significant health and
environmental benefits from the dramatic cuts in air pollution
released from these large trucks and buses," EPA Administrator
Christie Whitman said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration was apparently won over by a combination
of the regulations' promised benefits and the diverse groups--from
the auto industry to the Natural Resources Defense
Council--supporting them.</TE>
<TE>   Once fully implemented, the rule will cut 2.6 million tons
annually of smog-causing nitrogen oxide emissions and 11,000 tons of
soot or particulate matter, the EPA estimated. And 8,300 premature
deaths a year will be prevented, the agency said.</TE>
<TE>   The new diesel rule also is expected to have an array of positive
environmental consequences. It will cut haze in the nation's prized
wilderness settings, such as national parks; cut smog in cities such
as Los Angeles; reduce acid rain; and improve water quality in large
waterways where excess nitrogen is killing sea life.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's decision paves the way for the biggest air quality and
public health advance since we took lead out of gasoline more than 20
years ago," said Richard Kassel, an attorney for the Natural
Resources Defense Council. "There's nothing on the radar screen that
will come close in terms of environmental improvements and public
health benefits."</TE>
<TE>   The National Petrochemical &amp; Refiners Assn., one of the
organizations that sued the EPA, argued in its lawsuit that the
regulation required such quick reductions in the sulfur content of
fuels that the industry would not be able to keep up and shortages
would result.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement responding to the court ruling, the association
said it still believed "this costly regulation will have adverse
consequences for fuel supplies and the nation's refining industry."</TE>
<TE>   Regulation of diesel truck emissions lagged behind that of
passenger vehicles because in 1970, when the Clean Air Act was
written, many scientists believed that cars were a bigger problem.
Scientists believed that lead and carbon monoxide were bigger
threats, and gasoline-burning engines were major culprits.</TE>
<TE>   In recent decades, scientists have become increasingly aware of
the danger to public health and the environment presented by sulfur
dioxide, nitrogen oxide and particulates. Heavy lobbying from the oil
and trucking industries managed to protect diesel-burning engines
from regulation for years. But over the last few years, an odd-couple
alliance merged to promote the diesel standards developed by the
Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   One of the fiercest advocates of these rules was the auto
industry, which wants to sell diesel cars in America. However, those
cars need low-sulfur fuel to meet emission standards, which is not
widely available in the U.S. Under these rules, refiners would
produce more of the low-sulfur fuel sooner, auto makers said.</TE>
<TE>   The states joined in the drive for the tough standards. Federal
law requires them to meet clean-air standards.</TE>
<TE>   In part because of this unusual partnership, the Bush
administration moved quickly to implement the diesel rules while
putting on hold dozens of other environmental regulations that had
been proposed or finalized in the last months of the Clinton
administration.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's decision by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit will clear up the
uncertainty that has surrounded the new standards because of the
litigation, and make it more likely that the petroleum and engine
manufacturers can meet them, environmentalists and industry officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   The court rejected complaints by the industries that they could
not meet the EPA's deadlines.</TE>
<TE>   "The court's opinion ratifies EPA's conclusions that dramatic
reductions in the emission of pollutants are technologically
feasible," said Tom Sansonetti, assistant attorney general for
environment and natural resources.</TE>
<TE>   Cummins Inc., a Columbus, Ind.-based manufacturer of diesel
engines, argued there is not current technology available to
adequately strip smog-causing nitrogen oxide emissions to the levels
required by the new standard. Other manufacturers and the EPA
disagreed.</TE>

<HD>Enron Survey Assailed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) on Friday called the White House
response to his request for information about its dealings with Enron
Corp. "unacceptable"--the latest pull in the tug of war between
Congress and the Bush administration over the issue.</LD>
<LD>   Lieberman, chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee,
hinted that he might seek subpoenas to get the information for his
inquiry into whether the government could have done more to prevent
the energy giant's collapse.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to President Bush's lawyer, Lieberman said the panel
is wrapping up the information-gathering stage of its inquiry and
cannot wait much longer for information. "It does not appear that the
[White House] is making serious efforts to collect all information
responsive to the committee's request," he wrote to White House
counsel Alberto R. Gonzales.</LD>
<TE>   ''We've said that we are committed to working with the committee
on all reasonable requests, and we are doing that,'' said White House
spokeswoman Jeanie Mamo.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales asked senior White House officials earlier this week to
report contacts they may have had with Enron officials. But Gonzales
also suggested in a letter to Lieberman that the committee chairman
might be seeking information that goes beyond the scope of his
panel's inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman has sought, among other things, information about White
House contacts with Enron officials during the drafting of the
administration's energy plan early last year.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that the White House energy task force was disbanded months
before Enron filed for bankruptcy in December, Gonzales wrote: "We
are having difficulty understanding and assessing the committee's
needs in this area."</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman's letter comes as the Enron investigation frenzy that
followed the company's collapse has eased on Capitol Hill. But while
the number of televised hearings has declined, partisan wrangling has
intensified over Enron-inspired bills that call for accounting and
pension reforms.</TE>
<TE>   And Democrats have continued to use Bush's ties to former Enron
executives to portray the GOP as too cozy with special interests.
Republicans have responded by pointing out that many Democrats also
took Enron contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman, a possible Bush rival in 2004, was critical of a survey
sent out earlier this week by Gonzales asking more than 100 senior
administration officials to report by May 10 on contacts they may
have had with Enron representatives.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman assailed the "three-question" survey as "destined to
produce an inadequate response" and said it is unclear whether the
survey would detail contacts that Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney
had with Enron officials.</TE>
<TE>   The administration has acknowledged that Enron officials met six
times with members of the energy task force, including once with
Cheney, who headed it.</TE>
<TE>   But Democratic lawmakers have sought more details about the
private meetings with Enron and other industry advocates.</TE>
<TE>   The Energy Department and other federal agencies have released
thousands of pages of documents indicating that the energy industry
enjoyed far greater access to officials drafting the energy plan than
did environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress,
has filed a lawsuit to force Cheney to provide details about his
meetings with industry lobbyists.</TE>

<HD>Appalachia Digs Out After Flash Floods</HD>
<DH>Weather: Four deaths are reported, and several people are
missing. Some roads are under 15 feet of water. Utilities are out
over much of the region.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The skies were dark but dry Friday, and residents of the snug
Appalachian communities where Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia
meet ventured out to assess the damage from six hours of flash
floods, mudslides and tumbling boulders.</LD>
<LD>   They saw devastation.</LD>
<LD>   Houses were washed off their foundations. Water lapped at roof
shingles. Cars had been swept atop garages. Mobile homes had flipped.
Some walls had crumbled and some small businesses were wiped out.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities were reporting four deaths and several people missing.
And stories of near-misses were zipping from town to town.</TE>
<TE>   "We had people tie themselves to trees, to rooftops, to the tops
of motor vehicles--anywhere they could get out of the water," said
Vicky Jones, a sheriff's dispatcher in Buchanan County, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Conditions made it difficult to get an accurate tally of the
casualties--or even an estimate of how many people might be missing
or evacuated. Phone service and electricity were out over much of the
region, and some communities were cut off from rescue crews.</TE>
<TE>   "There are five people [from Buchanan County] still missing that
we know of, and we expect more to turn up missing," Jones said. "Our
deputies haven't gotten through everywhere. It's just awful."</TE>
<TE>   The disaster hit with frightening speed.</TE>
<TE>   Some parts of the region got as much of 4 inches of rain Thursday
in six hours. Several tornadoes blasted through. Fierce winds whipped
the mountain hollows. And there was hail as big as an inch in
diameter.</TE>
<TE>   "They've seen just about every imaginable severe weather event,"
said Eric Edge, a meteorologist for Weather Central in Madison, Wis.</TE>
<TE>   To make matters worse, the Ohio River Valley has been pounded with
heavy rain on and off for weeks, so the ground already was saturated,
the streams already brimming. Thursday's rain had nowhere to settle.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the Tug Fork River in far eastern Kentucky crested
Friday, it was nearly 20 feet above flood stage, according to Randal
Good, a deputy county judge in Pikeville, Ky. About 1,500 families in
Pike County were evacuated.</TE>
<TE>   Across the state line in Mingo County, W.Va., some highways were
under 15 feet of water. In some homes, the water was 8 feet deep.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not the worst flood ever, but it's right up there with
it," said Bill Davis, the Mingo County emergency services director.</TE>
<TE>   It was Friday afternoon, and Davis' voice was thick with
exhaustion. He had spent the last 24 hours directing rescues and
sending crews to deliver--by boat--oxygen, insulin and other vital
medications to residents stranded in their homes.</TE>
<TE>   "Yesterday afternoon about 2 p.m., I got my first call [for
help]," Davis said. "Then it was just one right after another."</TE>
<TE>   The tiny town of Hurley, Va., was among the hardest hit. By late
Thursday afternoon, the murky waters of Knox Creek were crashing
through the streets. The flood ripped down one of the post office's
cinder-block walls and punched a hole through the auto parts store.
Within hours, the post office was under 8 feet of water.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like a Third World country. That's exactly how it
looks," resident Rosemary Stacy said. "There's so much devastation,
people don't know what to do."</TE>
<TE>   Amid all the gloom, elementary school Principal Jeff Nash found
one reason for cheer: His small community of Welch, W.Va., pulled
together in a big way to help 15 kids trapped Thursday night at Welch
Elementary.</TE>
<TE>   Their school bus couldn't make it past the washed-out roads and
the piles of rocks. And their parents couldn't make it past those
same obstacles to pick them up at school. So more than a dozen
teachers, aides and custodians volunteered to stay with the stranded
students.</TE>
<TE>   A restaurant delivered hot dogs and French fries. And neighbors
who could make their way through the rain brought in pillows and
blankets.</TE>
<TE>   "We made an attempt to convince the boys that we were on a
camp-out and the girls that we were at a slumber party," Nash said.
"They slept real well."</TE>

<HD>A Girl Lost, an Agency Roiled</HD>
<DH>Crime: A 5-year-old girl was taken from Florida's child
welfare agency and is believed dead. Critics redouble calls for
reforms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Her name is Rilya and she is 5 years old--if she is still alive.
Somehow she fell through the cracks of the very system meant to
protect her.</LD>
<LD>   Workers with Florida's child welfare agency were supposed to be
checking monthly on Rilya Wilson, the daughter of a chronic drug
abuser. She had been taken from her mother by the state and placed
with a woman said to be her grandmother. But more than 15 months ago,
her guardian said, someone claiming to be from the Florida Department
of Children and Families took Rilya away, supposedly for an
evaluation.</LD>
<LD>   She hasn't been seen since.</LD>
<TE>   Officials in the Miami state attorney's office said this week that
they are treating Rilya's disappearance as a probable homicide. Said
Det. Ed Munn of the Miami-Dade Police Department: "The longer the
case progresses without locating the little girl, the chances are dim
that she is going to be found alive."</TE>
<TE>   The actions of the children and families agency, said department
head Kathleen Kearney, have been "abysmal." Authorities only learned
a few days ago of Rilya's disappearance because the original
caseworker had been filing phony reports, claiming she was visiting
the girl each month.</TE>
<TE>   "The ineptness in this case by the worker and the supervisor is
appalling," Kearney said from her office in Tallahassee. The
caseworker, Deborah Muskelly, resigned last month after an audit
found she had falsified records in other cases.</TE>
<TE>   Rilya's disappearance has sparked new criticism of how effectively
Florida's government protects its most vulnerable minors. In
December, a statewide committee found that 60 children had died of
abuse or neglect in 1999 and 2000, even though the Department of
Children and Families had received warnings of mistreatment.</TE>
<TE>   "We still have problems; there's no denying it," Gov. Jeb Bush
said earlier this week. But he added: "The biggest issue here is the
lack of wholesome love in family life in our state. To expect that
the government can fill that void in a perfect fashion is
impossible."</TE>
<TE>   Some state lawmakers have been questioning Kearney's leadership or
calling for her replacement. But Bush, who appointed her in December
1998, contended that she has turned around an agency that once was
"in complete disarray."</TE>
<TE>   The Republican governor, who is running for reelection, said
funding for child welfare has increased significantly since he became
governor in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   In testimony to a legislative committee this week, Kearney--a
former juvenile judge--explained that her agency has been reorganized
22 times in its 33-year history and crippled by "a chronic lack of
funding."</TE>
<TE>   But in the opinion of some private specialists, the department
under Kearney has performed even more poorly.</TE>
<TE>   "They know they've overloaded the caseworkers down there [in
Miami-Dade County] to the point where they can't get their job done,"
charged Karen Gievers, a Tallahassee attorney and president of the
Children's Advocacy Foundation. "It's mismanagement."</TE>
<TE>   Bush and Florida's legislature have allocated enough money to
bring the workload down to the nationally approved 17 children per
caseworker, Gievers said. But those funds, she added, don't seem to
have eased caseworkers' loads--an employee often handles more than
double the recommended number of cases.</TE>
<TE>   In Rilya's case, "the pressure may have been there to fudge
records to meet supervisors' demands," Gievers said. She said other
people in Kearney's department also had failed the girl, including
officials who should have put her up for formal adoption and those
who prepared periodic reports on her status for a judge.</TE>
<TE>   "The state had the job to keep this child safe," Gievers said.
"And if any of them had been doing their job, this kid would be alive
today."</TE>
<TE>   In televised remarks Friday, Ellen Morphonios, a former Miami-Dade
County judge, also gave a blistering verdict on the work of the
Department of Children and Families. Asked to explain how a child in
its care could have vanished, Morphonios replied: "Incompetence, No.
1; overworked employees, No. 2; underpaid employees, No. 3; and they
just don't give a damn heading the list."</TE>
<TE>   In April 2001, the nude and decapitated body of a young girl was
found in a wooded area of Kansas City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   The palm prints of that victim, nicknamed "Precious Doe,"
reportedly do not match those of Rilya. But Kansas City and
Miami-Dade police are continuing to investigate.</TE>
<TE>   In the view of Jack Levine, president of the Center for Florida's
Children, an advocacy group, what happened to Rilya could have
happened in any U.S. city with an overburdened child welfare system.</TE>
<TE>   "And frankly," added Levine, "there is no city without an
overburdened child welfare system."</TE>
<TE>   The trend in the larger states--including California, New York,
Texas and Florida--is to remove children from their parents if there
is a threat to their safety or welfare, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But politicians don't put their money where their mouths are when
it comes to appropriating funds to care for children who have become
the responsibility of the state.</TE>
<TE>   "We're like the old woman in a shoe," Levine said. "We have so
many children, we don't know what to do."</TE>

<HD>Inquiry of Intelligence Failures Hits Obstacles</HD>
<DH>Sept. 11: The lawmakers leading the investigation voice
concerns that the CIA and Justice Department are undermining efforts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Lawmakers leading the investigation of intelligence
agencies' failures surrounding the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks are
increasingly concerned that tactics by the CIA and the Justice
Department are actively impeding their efforts, congressional sources
said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Members of the Senate and House intelligence committees are so
frustrated with the tactics, sources said, that they intend to
complain directly to CIA Director George J. Tenet and Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), vice chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, declined to discuss the committee's concerns
with the CIA and the FBI in detail but said: "There are problems we
are going to have to address."</LD>
<TE>   The flare-up centers on obstacles congressional investigators say
the agencies have strewn in their path. The CIA, for example, has
refused to allow investigators to send their contact information to
agency employees by e-mail to make it easier for the employees to
volunteer information, congressional sources familiar with the
investigation said.</TE>
<TE>   At the Justice Department, the intelligence committees' requests
for records take weeks to wind their way through the department's
bureaucracy and sometimes are simply not acted upon, according to
sources familiar with the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The perceived heel-dragging has bogged down an inquiry that
already was sidetracked last week by the resignation of its lead
investigator. Congressional investigators are under pressure to
complete their work before ranking Intelligence Committee members'
terms expire at the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no time to waste," one source said, adding that the
targets of the inquiry seem intent on exploiting that deadline.
Although the agencies have cooperated somewhat, he said, their recent
tactics are a significant impediment.</TE>
<TE>   CIA officials flatly rejected the suggestion that they are less
than cooperative. "The CIA has provided extraordinary support to the
investigation staff," CIA spokesman Bill Harlow said. "We have
provided thousands of pages of documents, facilitated numerous
interviews, housed members of their staff in our headquarters and
provided briefings on counterterrorism, all while fighting a war.</TE>
<TE>   "We have had 15 members of the agency staff working full time
since before there was a congressional investigation collecting
material to aid their efforts."</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials also brushed aside investigators'
complaints. "The attorney general has worked cooperatively with
Congress on all matters related to Sept. 11 and will continue to do
so," said Barbara Comstock, director of public affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the intelligence committees discussed the perceived
lack of cooperation in meetings this week. Describing the mood among
members, one aide said, "You have to use the word 'angst.'"</TE>
<TE>   By Friday, the ranking members of the committees had agreed to
take the issue directly to the heads of the CIA and the Justice
Department. Sens. Bob Graham (D-Fla.) and Shelby, and Reps. Porter J.
Goss (R-Fla.) and Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) were going to
request meetings.</TE>
<TE>   A CIA official, who asked not to be identified, said he was
unaware of any planned meetings: "I can tell you that none of the
leadership of these committees have called Director Tenet to advise
him of any unhappiness."</TE>
<TE>   The friction underscores the stakes of an investigation that could
yield embarrassing details about what the nation's $30-billion
intelligence community knew or didn't know leading up to the Sept. 11
attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   The congressional probe was launched in February. It aims to
determine whether the terrorist attacks could have been prevented,
and to consider ways to improve the nation's intelligence
capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to the investigation said they recently obtained
documents indicating that an FBI agent in Arizona had warned
headquarters concerning his suspicions about Arabs training at area
aviation schools months before the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Small teams of investigators have been based at the Justice
Department and the CIA, gathering documents and conducting
interviews. They have come back with a litany of complaints about
tactics they say are designed to slow their progress and restrict
their access to documents and potential informants, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   All interviews with agency employees are supervised by CIA
officials who have prevented investigators even from collecting
business cards or phone numbers from interview subjects, sources
said.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA official said employees have been urged to cooperate with
the probe and that a notice listing investigators' contact
information is scheduled to be distributed next week.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators also complain that they have been stationed in a
location at the agency where employees cannot get to their offices
without passing by, and probably attracting the notice of, the CIA's
congressional affairs staff.</TE>
<TE>   "In a sense, they've put a wall up so no one can get to the
investigators," a congressional source said.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA official acknowledged that investigators were placed near
the agency's congressional affairs office but said that was to assist
the investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators also say their requests for certain documents have
been rebuffed, often by agency employees who explain that they first
need clearance from all other spy agencies that contributed material
to the documents.</TE>
<TE>   And when investigators do get to view documents, sources said, it
has been only under the supervision of CIA staffers.</TE>
<TE>   Former CIA officials say that they would be surprised if the
agency were intentionally hindering the investigation and that much
of the tension might be because of legitimate security concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "In my experience, I have been absolutely astonished at the amount
of detail the intelligence community and the CIA in particular give
the Congress," said Jeffrey Smith, a former general counsel for the
CIA.</TE>
<TE>   He said the only exceptions tend to be when there is a need to
protect sensitive information.</TE>
<TE>   As for the intelligence agency refusing to circulate
investigators' contact information, Smith said, partly in jest:
"Frankly, anybody at CIA who wants to leak to the committee who can't
figure out how to do it" probably shouldn't be working there.</TE>

<HD>Bush Says Delays on Judge Choices Creating 'Crisis'</HD>
<DH>Courts: The president blames Democrats for the backlog.
They respond that they are moving faster than GOP did on Clinton's
picks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The federal courts face a "vacancy crisis" because Senate Democrats
are not acting quickly enough on nominees, President Bush said
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The Democrats responded that, under their leadership, the Senate
was moving faster than it had when Republicans were in the majority
and President Clinton sent them judicial nominees.</LD>
<LD>   The White House and the Senate Democrats each offered statistics
to support their arguments. But beyond the numbers, the dispute drew
attention not only to the 88 vacancies in the federal district and
appellate courts but also to the Senate's practice of using
nominations as bargaining chips. Its pace for considering nominations
can be hastened or slowed in exchange for action on a broad sweep of
legislation.</LD>
<TE>   Friday was Law Day, marking the role of the legal profession in
the U.S., and Bush used it to draw attention to the dispute. He noted
that of the 100 judicial nominations he has sent to the Senate, only
52 have been confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   "The Senate thus far has not done its part to ensure that our
federal courts operate at full strength," Bush said in a speech at
the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. "Justice is at risk in
America, and the Senate must act for the good of the country.</TE>
<TE>   "The Senate can do much more and must do much more to address the
current vacancy crisis. By its inaction, the Senate is endangering
the administration of justice in America."</TE>
<TE>   Senate Democrats responded that of Bush's 100 nominations, 15 have
not received the consent of home-state senators, a crucial initial
step, 12 have not been reviewed by the American Bar Assn. and 19 have
been scheduled for hearings.</TE>
<TE>   "President Bush needs to get the facts straight. The fact is,
judicial vacancies dramatically increased under Republican control of
the Senate," Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said in a
statement. "In less than a year, Democrats have significantly reduced
those vacancies."</TE>
<TE>   In his speech to law professors, law enforcement representatives
and state bar association leaders, Bush said more than 10% of federal
judgeships are vacant. There are approximately 850 positions in the
federal judiciary, according to the Senate Judiciary Committee.</TE>
<TE>   In the Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, where some of the
most important constitutional cases are brought, four of the 12 seats
are empty. In the 6th Circuit Court, covering Michigan, Ohio,
Kentucky and Tennessee, half of the 16 positions are vacant.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate Judiciary Committee argues that it has worked faster
than Republicans did when they controlled the panel during Clinton's
presidency. The committee compared its confirmation of 52 of Bush's
100 nominees during the last 10 months with the 17 nominees confirmed
in 1996 and the 36 on which the panel acted in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the 52 already confirmed by the Senate reflect a more
productive pace than during the period 20 years ago when Republicans
held a majority in the Senate and Ronald Reagan was president. In the
first 10 months of 1981, 42 of his nominees were confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, they argue, the confirmation process for circuit
court nominees is accelerating: The time between receipt of the ABA's
report on a nominee and the full Senate's vote on the selection has
been averaging 109 days during the current Congress, compared with
374 days during the previous Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Blaming whatever delays there have been on Bush, Senate Judiciary
Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) said: "Controversial
nominations take longer, and the president can help by choosing
nominees primarily for their ability instead of for their ideology."</TE>
<TE>   So far, the Judiciary Committee has rejected one of Bush's
nominees: U.S. District Judge Charles W. Pickering, whom the
president picked for the appeals court. Democrats called him too
conservative, and his nomination was derailed on a straight
party-line vote.</TE>
<TE>   Citing the need for an independent judiciary, Leahy said, "The
Senate should not and will not rubber stamp nominees who would
undermine its independence and fairness."</TE>

<HD>White House to Ease Ban on Dumping of Mining Waste</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration said Friday that it was amending a rule that
environmentalists say bans the dumping of mine waste into the
nation's waterways.</LD>
<LD>   The administration contends that the dumping of debris from mining
activity is allowable and denied that the change would encourage
"mountaintop mining" of coal in which the tops of ridges in
Appalachia are sheared off and dirt and rock are pushed into streams.</LD>
<LD>   Environmentalists disagreed.</LD>
<TE>   "Now that the administration has changed the rules, it sends a
clear signal to the coal companies not only to continue but to
accelerate their destruction of waters," said Joan Mulhern, a lawyer
at Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund.</TE>
<TE>   The Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of
Engineers share responsibility for ensuring compliance with the Clean
Water Act by controlling permits for various types of dumping.</TE>
<TE>   The two agencies said Friday that they were implementing the new
rule to change Army Corps regulations dating to the 1970s that say
rivers and streams may not be used as repositories for industrial
waste. Instead, the Army Corps will adopt the EPA's definition of
"fill material," which does not include such a ban.</TE>
<TE>   The National Mining Assn. had argued for the change. It said
putting rocks and dirt from mining operations in waterways is no
different from filling stream beds to create land for construction,
which is allowed under Army Corps rules.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists say the Army Corps has violated its own
regulations by issuing permits to allow mountaintop mining. They are
suing the agency in federal court.</TE>

<HD>HHS Chief Asks Insurers to Help Healthy Efforts</HD>
<DH>Policy: Tommy G. Thompson says industry is 'wrongheaded' in
not encouraging better habits. He cites some unconventional ways to
go about the program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson, who is on a
one-man crusade to bully, cajole and otherwise lead Americans to
healthier lifestyles, said Friday he would try to enlist the help of
the private health insurance industry.</LD>
<LD>   Thompson called the current policies of insurance companies
"wrongheaded" for not doing more to encourage people to stay in shape
before they succumb to expensive maladies.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm going to call them all in, the private insurance companies,"
and appeal to them to do more to promote healthy living, Thompson
told reporters.</LD>
<TE>   In what he hopes to be the defining quest of his tenure, Thompson
said he was willing to consider the unconventional in order to
accomplish something no one else has: getting Americans to take
better care of themselves.</TE>
<TE>   He even is considering tax breaks for people who stay in shape.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't figured it out yet," he said, noting that a tax break
to offset the cost of a gym membership wouldn't guarantee that the
membership would be used. "These are all just ideas, but in the long
run, we could save a great deal of money, which would to some degree
stabilize [health insurance] premiums in this country."</TE>
<TE>   Insurers Say They Have Worked on Education</TE>
<TE>   Thompson points out that it costs $270 billion a year--the amount
of the entire Medicare budget--to treat the many preventable
conditions related to tobacco, adult-onset diabetes and obesity. He
says businesses would be well served by providing the time and
resources for employees to work out.</TE>
<TE>   Insurance industry officials say they have increased efforts in
recent years to educate enrollees, and they welcome suggestions about
how to do encourage more people to live healthier lives. They know
it's not easy.</TE>
<TE>   "Who hasn't seen a food pyramid indicating what we should eat? Who
doesn't know that being overweight isn't good for you?" said Joe
Rochok, a spokesman for the Health Insurance Assn. of America. "What
[Thompson] is talking about is lifestyle change, and the question is,
how do you get people to do that?"</TE>
<TE>   Still, Rochok said he believed the association's member companies
would be receptive to sitting down with Thompson to come up with
effective ways to get people to make better choices.</TE>
<TE>   The issue, Thompson admits, isn't very sexy. But he insists that,
in an era of rising health-care costs, it makes more sense to spend
money now to keep people healthy than a lot of money later to try to
get them well.</TE>
<TE>   For the 60-year-old Thompson, whose father had diabetes and died
of a heart attack at age 61, the message that "a little prevention
won't kill you" has had a sense of personal urgency.</TE>
<TE>   So he has led by example, dropping 8 pounds since January and
planning to lose at least 2 more. He has challenged his staff of
65,000 to do the same. His cholesterol, once as high as 300, is now
183. He has stopped eating late at night, cut back on starches and
increased his servings of fruits and vegetables. This week, he ran
nine-minute miles in the 3-mile Capital Challenge.</TE>
<TE>   If he can do it, he said, anyone can; you don't have to go from
couch potato to gym rat in a single step.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Hill, a family doctor in Tupelo, Miss., and chairman-elect
of the American Medical Assn., said Thompson might be on the right
path.</TE>
<TE>   People know how to improve their general health, but they don't
always act accordingly, Hill said.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing we have ever found that consistently changes
behavior is some sort of tangible incentive," he said, adding that he
would like to see the government contribute to a comprehensive health
education program that starts in childhood, with federal funds based
on performance.</TE>
<TE>   Health Official Applauds Thompson's Efforts</TE>
<TE>   Thompson's call for the insurance companies to do more was
applauded by Daniel Zingale, director of California's Department of
Managed Health Care.</TE>
<TE>   "The evidence shows that the benefits of preventive health are
stronger than the benefits of treating disease," Zingale said. "HMOs
should know that. That's supposed to be what they're about; it's even
in their name: health maintenance. It's like they got amnesia."</TE>
<TE>   Zingale said that, in California, health insurance companies do
virtually nothing to help people stop smoking and very little to
screen for common sexually transmitted diseases.</TE>
<TE>   "They could save us costs as a society because those costs turn up
not only in the health maintenance community, but in emergency rooms
and at the end of peoples' lives," Zingale said.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Thompson isn't shy about using fear to motivate the
masses.</TE>
<TE>   More than 700,000 deaths a year are attributed to inactivity or
smoking, he warned a luncheon crowd this week, adding that a recent
federal study found that 7 in 10 adults do not engage in regular
physical activity.</TE>

<HD>Priest in Court in Abuse Case</HD>
<DH>Crime: Father Paul Shanley waives extradition to Boston.
That archdiocese backs out of a huge deal with victims in another
case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN and TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>A Roman Catholic priest facing prosecution here for child rape waived
extradition in San Diego on Friday, hours before the Boston
archdiocese announced that it has backed out of a multimillion-dollar
settlement with 86 victims of former priest John Geoghan.</LD>
<LD>   Father Paul Shanley, 71, was wanted on three counts of repeatedly
raping a child. He will be held without bail in San Diego until
Massachusetts officials take him back to the state where the alleged
crimes occurred from 1983 to 1990.</LD>
<LD>   Shanley, who is expected to be arraigned in Boston early next
week, has made no comment since his name surfaced in January in
connection with alleged abuse by priests in the Boston archdiocese.</LD>
<TE>   White-haired and looking drawn in his blue prison jumpsuit, the
once-flamboyant "street priest" said only "certainly" when Superior
Court Judge David Szumowski asked whether he understood his right to
contest the extradition request from Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   A law enforcement official confirmed Friday that Shanley's alleged
victim in the complaint is 24-year-old Paul Busa, who earlier this
year left his job as a military policeman at Peterson Air Force Base
in Colorado, after reading news reports about Shanley.</TE>
<TE>   Busa, who also has filed a civil lawsuit against Shanley, was not
available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   But Middlesex County Dist. Atty. Martha Coakley said her Boston
office had investigated the allegations against Shanley and found
them credible. The alleged abuse, she said, took place after
religious education classes at St. Jean's Parish in Newton, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   Coakley said the priest allegedly had molested children in the
bathroom, the rectory and the confessional of the church.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,600 pages of archdiocese documents about Shanley
turned over to lawyers in conjunction with another civil lawsuit
illustrated the priest's history of advocating sex between men and
boys.</TE>
<TE>   The records also showed that church officials here had known of
abuse complaints against Shanley since at least 1967 but still
recommended him to a parish in Southern California as a priest "in
good standing."</TE>
<TE>   Similar records obtained earlier this year by the Boston Globe
revealed that the archdiocese also was aware of sexual abuse
complaints against Geoghan that dated back several decades.</TE>
<TE>   More than 130 people have accused Geoghan of molesting them during
his 30 years as a priest in the Boston area. Geoghan is serving a
nine- to 10-year sentence on a single count of molesting a boy at a
community swimming pool. A judge had refused to proceed with two
child rape charges against Geoghan because the statute of limitations
had expired.</TE>
<TE>   The revelations about Geoghan--followed by sordid disclosures
about Shanley--set off a worldwide crisis over pedophilia in the
priesthood. Since January, hundreds of priests have been removed from
their jobs in the U.S. alone.</TE>
<TE>   Boston attorney Mitchell Garabedian, who represents 86 alleged
Geoghan victims, spent 11 months negotiating a settlement with the
archdiocese, estimated at between $15 million and $40 million. A deal
was struck in March, and by midweek a process had been agreed upon to
determine how much the church would pay each alleged victim. Payoffs
were expected to be in the range of about $400,000 apiece.</TE>
<TE>   But late Thursday, Boston church officials said the deal would
devastate the archdiocese financially.</TE>
<TE>   Unanimously voting to reject Cardinal Bernard Law's request to
sign off on the deal, the finance council of the archdiocese refused
to fund the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The council said the settlement "would consume substantially all
of the resources of the archdiocese that can reasonably be made
available, and therefore such an action would leave the archdiocese
unable to provide a just and proportional response to other victims,"
according to a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The council recommended instead that the cardinal develop a
mechanism to provide victims and their families with counseling.</TE>
<TE>   Since the mid-1990s, the Boston archdiocese has paid an estimated
$15 million to 40 other alleged Geoghan victims.</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocese spokeswoman Donna M. Morrissey did not return a call
Friday seeking comment. Garabedian also was unavailable.</TE>
<TE>   The finance council's action marked the first time since Law came
to Boston in 1984 that the council did not give its consent to
something he had supported.</TE>
<TE>   David Smith, chancellor of the archdiocese, said in the statement
that Law expressed "deep regret at the vote."</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, acting Massachusetts Gov. Jane Swift signed a bill
requiring clergy to report cases of suspected abuse to state social
workers.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new law, clergy, congregation leaders and church youth
workers will have 30 days to turn over any information about child
abuse, no matter how old, to the state Department of Social Services.
Violation is a misdemeanor offense that carries a fine of up to
$1,000.</TE>
<TE>   The law does not require clergy to report any information gained
in confessions or through similar confidential channels observed by
other faiths.</TE>
<TE>   In signing the bill, Swift acknowledged that "unfortunately, this
legislation, as we all know, comes too late for too many."</TE>

<HD>Ruling: Thou Shalt Remove Commandments</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHATTANOOGA, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>A federal judge Friday ordered the removal of the Ten Commandments at
two municipal buildings, ruling that their display violates the
constitutional separation of church and state.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Allan Edgar ordered the removal of the Ten
Commandments at the Hamilton County Courthouse and City Courts
Building. The commandments are on engraved plaques shaped like a
stone tablet.</LD>
<LD>   However, Edgar said the Ten Commandments display can remain at
Hamilton County's Juvenile Court Building because the plaintiffs, the
Tennessee chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, did not have
the right to challenge the posting there.</LD>
<TE>   Edgar said none of the plaintiffs does business at the Juvenile
Court and so have not "endured unwelcome contact" with the display
there.</TE>
<TE>   The ACLU and several Hamilton County residents had sued, claiming
the displays violate religious freedom and are "divisive to religious
diversity."</TE>
<TE>   The Ten Commandments were posted in December after a September
vote by Hamilton County commissioners. Commission Chairman Bill
Hullander has testified that the idea of posting them occurred to him
a few days after the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Edgar said the nation's founders "made a conscious decision" to
separate religion and government, which "has served us well."</TE>
<TE>   "Experience tells us that there is perhaps nothing more divisive
than the interjection of religion into our government. The
controversy engendered by this commission action is proof of this,"
Edgar wrote.</TE>
<TE>   ACLU state director Hedy Weinberg reserved comment until she had
read the judge's opinion. The attorney for the defendants did not
immediately return a message seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   More than half of Tennessee's 95 counties have approved similar
Ten Commandments displays, and more than 30 have posted the biblical
laws.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Chicago White Sox wanted this one.</LD>
<LD>   Frank Thomas homered and Mark Buehrle became the American League's
first five-game winner Friday as the White Sox won, 6-1, at Chicago
to end a 10-game losing streak to the Oakland Athletics.</LD>
<LD>   "They embarrassed us last weekend," said Thomas, who was two for
three. "We're just happy to come back and win. We'll be happy to try
and sweep them this weekend, because they really kicked our butts
last weekend."</LD>
<TE>   The White Sox went to Oakland last weekend playing well and were
promptly outscored, 32-5. They've been nursing a bit of a grudge ever
since.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, they've been itching to beat the A's since last year.</TE>
<TE>   "It was big," Buehrle said. "We don't think they're that good of a
team to beat us 10 games in a row. We just went there and didn't play
good at all. Pitching, defense, offense, everything wasn't there. So
it was good to get everything back on a roll."</TE>
<TE>   Buehrle (5-2) rebounded from an awful start last weekend, when he
gave up a career-high eight runs in 22/3 innings, the shortest outing
of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Though he threw 120 pitches Friday, he gave up only an RBI single
and scattered six hits over 62/3 innings. He struck out five.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 4, Cleveland 2--Carl Everett hit a two-run double off Danys
Baez (3-3) at Cleveland as the Rangers extended their winning streak
to six games with a victory over the staggering Indians.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Davis (3-2) pitched into the sixth inning, and Steve Woodard,
John Rocker and Rudy Seanez--all former Indians--preserved the lead
until Hideki Irabu worked a hitless ninth for his seventh save.</TE>
<TE>   The Indians have lost six in a row, 15 of 17 overall, and seven in
a row at home for the first time since 1990 when they played at
Municipal Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 4, Kansas City 3--Mike Bordick scored the tiebreaking
run on a passed ball in the eighth inning at Baltimore as the Orioles
kept Royal interim Manager John Mizerock winless (0-4).</TE>
<TE>   With the score tied 3-3, Bordick opened the eighth with a double
off Cory Bailey (0-4) and moved to third on a sacrifice. With Jerry
Hairston at the plate, Royal catcher Juan Brito let a pitch get past
him, and Bordick scored standing up.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 3, Tampa Bay 2--The Red Sox rallied for two runs in the
ninth inning at St. Petersburg, Fla., going ahead on catcher Toby
Hall's wild pickoff throw to extend the Devil Rays' losing streak to
eight games.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 8, Detroit 4--Brad Radke (3-2) survived a rocky first
inning to win for the first time in four starts, and Doug
Mientkiewicz homered and drove in four runs to lead the Twins at
Minneapolis.</TE>

<HD>Glaus Is a Good Contact Hitter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>When Troy Glaus says he isn't seeing the ball well, he isn't
necessarily resorting to cliche. The Angel third baseman wears
contact lenses when he plays, and he says changes in his eyes this
year have made it difficult to secure lenses that fit comfortably.</LD>
<LD>   "I've tried seven, eight, nine different pairs," he said. "The
ones I have now are better than anything I've had.... Hopefully,
before not too long, we'll have something that really works."</LD>
<LD>   That could be an unsettling prospect for opposing pitchers.
Troublesome contacts and all, Glaus is hitting .290 and ranks fourth
in the American League with 27 runs batted in.</LD>
<TE>   Glaus could be rid of his lenses if he were willing to undergo
corrective laser surgery. But he sees no point in risking the
complications of surgery, no matter how small the odds, in a
profession in which clear vision is critical.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to be that one-tenth of 1% and not be able to play
anymore," he said. "If I can correct it by wearing contacts, that's a
way."</TE>
<TE>   Pitcher Jarrod Washburn opted for laser surgery last year,
accepting the risk after extensive research about the procedure and
doctors that perform it. He is thrilled with the results.</TE>
<TE>   "I see better now than I did with my contacts," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There is no friendly wager between the Molina brothers to see who
finishes the year with the better batting average. Bengie Molina, the
Angels' starting catcher, is hitting .326. Jose Molina, the starting
catcher at triple-A Salt Lake, is hitting .330.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like any competition with him," Bengie Molina said. "I
just hope he does so well that he can get up here."</TE>
<TE>   Jorge Fabregas, the Angels' veteran backup catcher, is hitting
.105 in 19 at-bats. But, with the Angels hoping Bengie Molina can
catch 125 to 135 games this season, the team does not expect offense
from a backup playing once a week. Both Fabregas and Jose Molina are
considered excellent defenders.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, we're happy with Bengie and Jorge," Manager Mike
Scioscia said. "When you have someone as talented as Jose if
something needed to be done, you feel very comfortable with your
catching."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With Benji Gil expected back by month's end and Shawn Wooten
expected back next month, and with the team winning in the meantime,
the Angels are no longer actively searching for a right-handed
hitter. A team official said they do not plan to pursue a trade for
the Texas Rangers' Gabe Kapler, who is available.</TE>

<DH>Baseball: After filling bases in ninth, he retires last two
Blue Jays to seal Angels' eighth straight win, 6-4.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>Troy Percival had done little to contribute to the Angels' winning
streak, through no fault of his own. In blowouts, closers are
strictly optional.</LD>
<LD>   But as the Angels won their eighth consecutive game Friday,
Percival got an assist and a save. He tipped starter Aaron Sele to a
flaw in his delivery, helping Sele survive a rocky start. And he
ended the game with a flourish, retiring Carlos Delgado and Raul
Mondesi with the bases loaded to preserve a 6-4 victory over the
Toronto Blue Jays.</LD>
<LD>   Percival had not pitched in four days and had not earned a save in
a week, with the Angels outscoring opponents, 75-23, during the
winning streak. He has four saves, three fewer than neophyte closer
Hideki Irabu of the Texas Rangers.</LD>
<TE>   "If we end the season and I have four saves and pitch 22 innings,
I'll be a happy man," Percival said. "I'd be fresh for the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   Nothing wrong with a little optimism from the closer, not with the
Angels closing in on the club-record winning streak of 11 games, set
in 1964. Darin Erstad provided the game-winning home run as the
Angels (14-14) scrambled to .500 for the first time since April 2.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to be a .500 team," Erstad said. "That's not a
goal of ours. We plan on being much better than that."</TE>
<TE>   Erstad plans on being much better than the .258 hitter he was last
year and the .242 hitter he was two weeks ago. He missed seven games
after sustaining a concussion, then went hitless in his first game
back. Since then, he is hitting .450 (nine for 20), with his first
two home runs of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "When you can see that mano-a-mano look in his eyes, you know he's
right," Percival said. "You can see it now."</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Jays led, 4-1, after five innings. Erstad started the
sixth with a single, stole second and later scored on a sacrifice fly
by Tim Salmon. In the seventh, after Jorge Fabregas drove in his
first run of the season with a single, the Angels put runners on
second and third with one out.</TE>
<TE>   Fabregas, on third base, represented the tying run. Adam Kennedy,
on second base, represented the go-ahead run. And that left Toronto
Manager Buck Martinez with an open base and a question: Pitch to
Erstad, or pitch around him to set up a potential inning-ending
double play?</TE>
<TE>   Martinez opted to pitch to Erstad. The Toronto manager played his
trump card--Pedro Borbon, an undistinguished left-handed reliever but
one who had faced Erstad eight times and retired him every time.</TE>
<TE>   "He's pretty much abused me," Erstad said.</TE>
<TE>   Not this time, not this streak.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad hit Borbon's first pitch for a three-run homer. The Angels
thank Borbon for his contribution to their winning streak. He also
gave up their game-winning home run last Sunday, the 14th-inning
grand slam hit by David Eckstein.</TE>
<TE>   The good teams dispose of the bad ones. The Angels arrived here
after sweeping the Cleveland Indians, losers of 15 of 17. The Blue
Jays, with the worst record in the league, have lost nine in a row.</TE>
<TE>   But for the second time in six days, Toronto scored three runs off
Sele in the first inning. Sele gave up four hits in the inning, two
more in the second and did not appear long for the game.</TE>
<TE>   Percival, watching video in the clubhouse, noticed Sele's shoulder
was out of sync with the rest of his delivery. Jarrod Washburn saw it
too. With the kind advice of his teammates, Sele held Toronto to one
run over the next four innings.</TE>
<TE>   "If I hadn't made those adjustments, it would have been a real
short day," Sele said.</TE>
<TE>   Sele gritted out six innings on a season-high 120 pitches, picking
up the victory for hanging in there until he could hand a lead to the
bullpen. Mark Lukasiewicz, Al Levine and Percival took care of the
final nine outs.</TE>
<TE>   The final two did not come easily. After Dave Berg struck out to
start the ninth inning, the Jays loaded the bases on a bloop single,
an error by third baseman Troy Glaus and a walk.</TE>
<TE>   With the tying run on second base and the winning run on first,
Percival shrugged and struck out Delgado. On a check swing, Mondesi
grounded out. The Angels were a .500 team once again.</TE>
<TE>   "It means a ton to me," Percival said. "Now you can start chipping
away at the boys on top."</TE>

<KH>128TH KENTUCKY DERBY</KH>
<HD>Louisville Now 19-Horse Town</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Almost everyone has a favorite in the big
race. Buddha scratches because of bruised foot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>This is the 128th Kentucky Derby in a nutshell: Eighteen pundits for
the Daily Racing Form have rapped in, and none of them likes Harlan's
Holiday, the Blue Grass and Florida Derby winner and the 9-2
morning-line favorite.</LD>
<LD>   In other words, today's Derby is a harum-scarum affair. Talk to 10
clockers and you get 11 opinions. One of them wanted to have it both
ways.</LD>
<LD>   In many Derbies, there might be half a dozen horses that figure,
but this one has few throw-outs. Shucks, the favorite is an
Ohio-bred, and the field includes a New York-bred, Private Emblem,
and a California-bred, Lusty Latin, that actually have chances.
Horses from those jurisdictions are usually better off staying home.</LD>
<TE>   The Derby enigma got slightly easier Friday morning, when Buddha,
winner of the Wood Memorial and co-second choice with Santa Anita
Derby winner Came Home at 5-1, was scratched because of a bruised
foot, but there still are 19 horses to sort out. Post time at
Churchill Downs is 3:04 p.m., Los Angeles time. Attendance will be
well over 100,000, but perhaps smaller than recent years because of
sluggish post-Sept. 11 travel habits and warnings about high security
at the track.</TE>
<TE>   A worst-case scenario for Kentucky breeders, who have accounted
for a record 96 Derby winners, and seven of the last eight, would be
if Harlan's Holiday and Easy Grades complete a 1-2 exacta. Harlan's
Holiday's Ohio lineage is considered the wrong side of the tracks,
and Easy Grades, while bred in Kentucky, is a gelding, a horse with
no breeding future.</TE>
<TE>   But if you like Came Home a lot, you have to like Easy Grades a
little, because he was second, 21/4 lengths behind Came Home, in the
Santa Anita Derby, even though his jockey that day, Gary Stevens, had
trouble steering because of a bollixed bridle. Easy Grades will be
ridden today by Jorge Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   As an unraced 2-year-old, Easy Grades was bought by Scott
Guenther, a Newport Beach carpet and rug manufacturer, who paid
$30,000 at auction.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the only horse we bought all that year," said Ted H. West,
who at 28 is in a spot to become one of the Derby's youngest winning
trainers. "We thought he might bring about $100,000 going into the
sale. When we got him, we weren't sure we had a bargain or whether
there was something wrong with him that we hadn't noticed. When the
sale price is so far under your estimated price, you begin to
wonder."</TE>
<TE>   Cheaply bought horses routinely win the Derby. The
bargain-basement winners in recent years include Real Quiet, who cost
$17,000, and Silver Charm, who was sold twice, both times for less
than $100,000. Seattle Slew, the last Triple Crown champion sold at
auction, was a $17,500 yearling.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens, who rode Silver Charm and two Derby winners before him,
moves from Easy Grades to Johannesburg, one of the two so-called
mystery horses from Ireland. Johannesburg, the Breeders' Cup Juvenile
winner in his only U.S. start, and his stablemate, Castle Gandolfo,
have been holed up in Lexington, 70 miles east, since they crossed
the Atlantic on Tuesday. They were not allowed to train for two days
because of quarantine restrictions. All of the other Derby
contenders, including early arrival Essence Of Dubai from the United
Arab Emirates, have been training at Churchill.</TE>
<TE>   Aidan O'Brien will have Johannesburg and Castle Gandolfo vanned
over this morning, although the vaunted Irish trainer himself is not
expected. Pat Keating, an assistant trainer, said Friday that O'Brien
had an ear infection.</TE>
<TE>   Besides drawing the inside post, Johannesburg is coming into the
race off a defeat--his only loss--in a seven-furlong grass race at
the Curragh on April 7.</TE>
<TE>   A Derby hasn't been won by a horse with only one start as a
3-year-old since Bold Venture in 1936.</TE>
<TE>   Castle Gandolfo, whose only prep this year was a 11/2-length win
at a mile on an English all-weather surface similar to Churchill's,
is perceived by some to have a better chance than Johannesburg at the
Derby distance of 11/4 miles. Jerry Bailey, who has two notches in
his Derby belt, will ride Castle Gandolfo for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Castle Gandolfo and Essence Of Dubai are the only horses in the
field that have run 11/4 miles. Essence Of Dubai won the United Arab
Emirates Derby--at $2 million, almost twice as rich as the Kentucky
Derby--on March 23, and appears to have recovered from a 12th-place
finish, 20 lengths behind Johannesburg, in the Breeders' Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Sheik Mohammed, the crown prince of Dubai, customarily has many of
his young horses begin their careers in California. Essence Of Dubai
broke his maiden at Hollywood Park last July and later won the
Norfolk at Santa Anita. With Frankie Dettori riding in the 2000
Guineas at Newmarket in England--where the sheik himself will be--the
California-based David Flores will take over.</TE>
<TE>   In the last three years, Sheik Mohammed has run four horses in the
Derby, among them Worldly Manner, a colt he bought from the late John
Mabee in California for an estimated $5 million. Worldly Manner ran
seventh in 1999, and none of the sheik's other starters did much
better.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this one is our best chance," said Saeed bin Suroor, who
trains Essence Of Dubai. "He's the best horse we've brought over
here."</TE>
<TE>   Essence Of Dubai, a Kentucky-bred son of Pulpit and Epitome, was
sold at a yearling auction at Keeneland, the sheik paying $2.3
million. That's almost 77 times the price of Easy Grades, and one of
the manifold charms of the Derby.</TE>

<HD>McGriff Takes Two Bites Out of the Dodgers</HD>
<DH>Baseball: The other Cub slugger hits a pair of homers and
drives in four in 8-3 victory over sloppy home team.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was not the Dodgers' most lopsided loss of the season, but it was
certainly the ugliest, an eyesore of an 8-3 defeat at the hands of
the Chicago Cubs before 46,026 in Dodger Stadium Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   How fitting the Dodgers gave away rally towels before the game.
There was quite a mess to clean up afterward.</LD>
<LD>   Twice, the Dodgers failed to execute sacrifice bunts that could
have aided rallies when the game was still close, and twice Dodger
starter Andy Ashby hung curveballs that were belted for home runs.</LD>
<TE>   There was an inexcusable mental gaffe by Brian Jordan, whose
failure to run out a fifth-inning popup resulted in a double play.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers failed to score after loading the bases with one out
in the sixth, and a Dodger bullpen that tossed six shutout innings in
Thursday night's 14-inning victory over the Cincinnati Reds was
roughed up for five runs in three innings.</TE>
<TE>   "It was one of those days," Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca said. "We
played a 14-inning game last night and came out a little sluggish
tonight. We had our chances to blow the game open and didn't take
advantage of it."</TE>
<TE>   Cub first baseman Fred McGriff became the 27th player in major
league history to reach 450 home runs when he homered to center off
Ashby in the top of the sixth to tie the score, 3-3, and his
three-run homer in the seventh broke open a one-run game and gave the
Cubs a 7-3 lead.</TE>
<TE>   But before the Cubs rallied for four runs in the seventh, the
Dodgers threatened in the bottom of the sixth when Eric Karros led
off with a single and Adrian Beltre singled to right, putting runners
on first and second with the score tied, 3-3.</TE>
<TE>   Up stepped No. 8 batter Mark Grudzielanek, who singled in his
first two at-bats. Grudzielanek admitted earlier this season that he
is not a very good bunter, but Manager Jim Tracy asked him to
sacrifice anyway and Grudzielanek fouled off three consecutive bunt
attempts for a strikeout.</TE>
<TE>   Pinch-hitter Dave Hansen walked to load the bases, but
pinch-hitter Marquis Grissom struck out trying to check his swing on
a Ron Mahay fastball, and Cesar Izturis flied to right to end the
inning.</TE>
<TE>   There was a little twist to the Grudzielanek at-bat. Tracy
actually removed the bunt sign with two strikes, but Grudzielanek,
who couldn't pull his bat back on a high-and-tight second pitch,
bunted on his own.</TE>
<TE>   "I probably should have tried to hit away, but I was just trying
to get the guys over," Grudzielanek said. "If I get the bunt down and
we score, [Tracy] looks great. To do what I did was probably
unacceptable. I haven't bunted much in the past. I'm not a good
bunter, never have been.</TE>
<TE>   "I was more disappointed I wasn't able to pull the bat back on the
second pitch, because that's what the manager wanted. I was trying to
do what the manager asked. Then, I took it upon myself to try to get
the last one down."</TE>
<TE>   Former Dodger Delino DeShields doubled off reliever Jesse Orosco
to lead off the seventh for the Cubs. Corey Patterson sent a
sacrifice bunt attempt past the charging Beltre at third, and with
Izturis covering second, the shortstop hole was vacant.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson's bunt rolled toward the outfield grass, enabling
DeShields to score from second for a 4-3 lead and the speedy
Patterson to take second, a play that was ruled a bunt double. Tracy
summoned right-hander Paul Quantrill, who hit Mark Bellhorn with a
pitch.</TE>
<TE>   Quantrill struck out Sammy Sosa and got Moises Alou to fly to
left, but McGriff ripped a fastball over the wall in center for a
three-run home run and a 7-3 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't see a bunt double very often," Cub Manager Don Baylor
said. "It's the little things that win games."</TE>
<TE>   Alex Gonzalez's two-run homer in the second gave the Cubs a 2-0
lead, but the Dodgers scored in the second (Grudzielanek RBI single)
and twice in the third on RBI singles by Lo Duca and Shawn Green to
take a 3-2 lead. The third inning could have been a lot bigger, but
with runners on first and second and none out, Jordan popped to
first, Karros popped to short and Beltre flied to center.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan extended his hitless string to 14 consecutive at-bats, but
that wasn't as humbling as his mistake in the fifth, when he failed
to run out an infield fly with Green on first and one out.</TE>
<TE>   Bellhorn, the Cub third baseman, couldn't make the catch, but he
had plenty of time to recover and throw Jordan out at first. Green
had to hold near first base on the popup and was tagged out in a
brief rundown between first and second, ending the inning.</TE>

<DH>Lakers' O'Neal, Usually Horrible From the Free-Throw Line,
Seems to Be Overcoming His Most Glaring Weakness</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Imagine Philip Anschutz getting a winning lottery ticket, Hugh Hefner
getting another girlfriend, Randy Johnson getting a new pitch.</LD>
<LD>   There's a word for that: "Overkill."</LD>
<LD>   Imagine Shaquille O'Neal developing a consistently smooth and
accurate shot from the free-throw line.</LD>
<TE>   There's a word for that too. Several of them, in fact, the types
of words Mike Tyson favors and are not printable in a family
newspaper. Such words may be muttered more and more by opposing
players.</TE>
<TE>   Because it is becoming apparent that O'Neal, already the dominant
player in the league, is overcoming his biggest weakness.</TE>
<TE>   The man who once stared across the free-throw line as if it were a
barrier between him and the basket now saunters up with a smile on
his face, a relaxed air about him. Where once he shot free throws
with his body stiff, his arm pausing at the top of his motion as if
he were a cop halting traffic, now he goes through the routine with
fluidity and finality.</TE>
<TE>   Said teammate Rick Fox, "Shaq once joked that if he made his free
throws, it would not really be fair. I guess he has decided to make
it a little more unfair.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not running away from fouls anymore. He's looking for people
to foul him. He's even talking a little trash at the line."</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant has also noticed.</TE>
<TE>   "He seems more confident," Bryant said. "People are not dogging
him out because he's making [his free throws]. Teams can't do that
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   The evidence is clear. O'Neal's free-throw shooting, acceptable at
times, horrendous at other times over his 10-year career, was poor
enough to inspire Hack-a-Shaq, the strategy of deliberately fouling
O'Neal to force him to his weakest area, the free-throw line.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, O'Neal has made little more than half his free
throws. Twice in regular-season play, he finished below 50%. While
still with the Orlando Magic, in 12 playoff games in the 1995-96
season, he shot 39.3% from the line.</TE>
<TE>   But this season, he was successful on 55.5% of his free throws.
Over his final seven regular-season games, O'Neal shot a
stunning--for him--70.1% from the line. In the three playoff games
against the Portland Trail Blazers, he shot 65.7% (23 of 35).</TE>
<TE>   "Over the last year, it seemed like he changed it all the time,"
Coach Phil Jackson said. "One time he'd be shooting the ball from
here, one time from there, one time on the way up and one time while
he's stiff-legged.... Now he's got a system that works.... This is
the longest consistent period of time he's shot the ball."</TE>
<TE>   What has changed?</TE>
<TE>   Ed Palubinskas, a free-throw coach, hasn't worked with O'Neal in a
year, but that didn't stop Palubinskas from taking credit for the
turnaround.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's put it this way, he's following everything I wanted him to
do and he never did that before I was there," Palubinskas said from
his Baton Rouge, La., home.</TE>
<TE>   "What has happened is that he has eliminated all the rubbish. His
follow-through is consistent. It's still not as consistent as you
would like, but are you kidding me? He's gone over 70%. What happened
to Hack-a-Shaq?</TE>
<TE>   "I love it, just love it. All the extra movement, all that garbage
he was carrying on the mechanics are gone. Now he's tighter. There is
no wasted energy. I can't remember seeing him hit the front of the
rim. It's becoming more and more a part of him.</TE>
<TE>   "I just hope he has a memory chip in his brain so that he can
continue to remember what we worked on, but he's pretty close now to
where he needs to be."</TE>
<TE>   Palubinskas says there are simple remedies for O'Neal if he should
falter again.</TE>
<TE>   "For example, if he is hitting the back of the rim, he needs to
get his elbow further under the ball by five degrees," Palubinskas
said.</TE>
<TE>   Laker special consultant Bill Sharman, who shot 88.3% from the
line in his playing career, thinks a toe injury, which kept O'Neal on
the sidelines often during practice this season, might have been a
key factor, leaving O'Neal with nothing else to do but work on his
free throws.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest thing in being a good free-throw shooter is
repetition," Sharman said.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the reason, the result could have the rest of the league
crying foul.</TE>

<HD>Cameron Classy in His Own Respect</HD>
<DH>Baseball: One night after adhering to age-old practice with
chance to hit fifth homer, Mariner goes 0 for 4.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>With four home runs in the game already and a chance to break the
record, Mike Cameron chose to follow baseball decorum instead.</LD>
<LD>   That may be one reason why so many people in baseball were happy
for Cameron, now known for so much more than being the player who
replaced Ken Griffey Jr. in Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   After hitting home runs in his first four at-bats against the
Chicago White Sox on Thursday night at Comiskey Park, Cameron came up
in the ninth with a chance to become the only major league player to
hit five in a game.</LD>
<TE>   After Mike Porzio threw three consecutive balls in a 15-4 game,
Cameron let a hittable pitch go by for strike one, following the
age-old practice of not swinging at a 3-0 pitch in a blowout.</TE>
<TE>   "It wouldn't be too good for my team if I swung 3-0," Cameron said
Friday before going 0 for 4 in Seattle's 6-2 victory over the New
York Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not the way you play the game with that kind of lead in
the ninth inning."</TE>
<TE>   After fouling off a 3-1 pitch, Cameron lined an opposite-field
drive that had fans thinking he had hit it out. But right fielder
Jeff Liefer made a running, backhanded catch at the front of the
warning track.</TE>
<TE>   "Fortunately he threw me a strike and I had an opportunity to go
for No. 5," Cameron said. "I have respect for the way the game is
played."</TE>
<TE>   White Sox General Manager Kenny Williams said he wouldn't have had
a problem had Cameron swung 3-0 but was impressed that he didn't.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got a chance to do something no one's ever done," Williams
said. "It's our guy's fault he got to 3-0 in the first place. I
thought it was Mike Cameron showing his class." Cameron's teammates
left a homemade silver bat, wrapped in aluminum foil, in his locker
Friday, to go along with the "King Cam" crown he had been given the
night before.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron then went out and hit only one ball out of the infield--a
drive to deep center in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners got home runs from Jeff Cirillo and Desi Relaford off
Ted Lilly (0-3), and Freddy Garcia (4-2) allowed two runs and three
hits in eight innings.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia beat the Yankees, 1-0, last Saturday when Relaford's RBI
single broke up Lilly's no-hit bid with one out in the eighth inning.</TE>

<LD>Jason Keller passed Bobby Hamilton Jr. with 12 laps to go Friday
night and won the Hardee's 250, an event that tied the Richmond (Va.)
International Raceway record for Busch series cautions.</LD>
<LD>   Eleven yellow flags flew, most coming in the first half of the
race as a new sealer on the track made the turns treacherous. The
pace was slowed for 85 of the 250 laps, and 19 cars were finished
before the end came.</LD>
<LD>   The victory was Keller's third in 10 races this season and first
at Richmond.</LD>

<TE>   Burton turned his lap midway through the session and sweated it
out as Dale Earnhardt Jr., Jeff Gordon, Rusty Wallace and Tony
Stewart challenged. Earnhardt came the closest with a lap at 127.179.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Tomas Scheckter was suspended for the first three days of

<DL>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>Bob Baffert and Wayne Lukas were sitting next to each other at a
recent racing function when Baffert said to Lukas, "Everyone used to
hate you. Now they hate me."</LD>
<LD>   It's as clear as a giant flowered hat, and just as ugly.</LD>
<LD>   At rowdy Churchill Downs today, the only thing more quietly
despised than Bob Baffert will be a Breathalyzer.</LD>
<TE>   The 128th Kentucky Derby will feature 19 horses, 150,000 fans, and
one villain.</TE>
<TE>   Baffert will saddle longshot War Emblem.</TE>
<TE>   While being roasted for buying his way into the Derby.</TE>
<TE>   Baffert will also saddle longshot Danthebluegrassman.</TE>
<TE>   While being called Bobthecheesyman, because the horse was entered
at the last minute, knocking out a rival owner.</TE>
<TE>   Remember five years ago, when Baffert left Louisville as a Silver
Charm?</TE>
<TE>   Remember four years ago, when he won his second consecutive Derby
by being anything but Real Quiet?</TE>
<TE>   Back then, he was racing's favorite new silks, brightly colored
and perfectly fitted.</TE>
<TE>   Now, he's that gaudy blanket the railbirds can't wait to discard.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the smiles have turned to smirks. Back slaps have turned
to rolled eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "Just as quick as they build you up in this business, they tear
you down," Lukas said, smiling. "I know all about it."</TE>
<TE>   The media and Baffert once loved each other. Then last spring, he
angrily poked a noted racing writer in the chest.</TE>
<TE>   The fans once loved him too. Then last spring, he left Churchill
Downs to jeers.</TE>
<TE>   It's enough to turn a man's hair black.</TE>
<TE>   "There's so much jealousy in our business," Baffert said earlier
this week. "They don't like anything new or different. They don't
like change."</TE>
<TE>   Standing near his barn on the backstretch, it was clear again that
the Santa Anita-based Baffert is different, before he ever opens his
mouth.</TE>
<TE>   He arrives at the track after dawn. He never seems to get mud on
his pants, straw in his hair.</TE>
<TE>   On this day, he is the only trainer wearing not some feed-store
sweatshirt, but an NFL logo-covered golf shirt. The shirt features
the emblem of the expansion Houston Texans. He does work for team
owner Bob McNair, who also owns horses.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him, one day, my horse is going to be worth more than his
quarterback," Baffert said.</TE>
<TE>   His football mentality makes him different.</TE>
<TE>   Four weeks ago, when Danthebluegrassman finished last in the Santa
Anita Derby, it looked as if Baffert would be out of the Kentucky
Derby for the first time in seven years.</TE>
<TE>   But then Baffert took what the defense gave him.</TE>
<TE>   First, after learning that Illinois Derby winner War Emblem would
not run in Kentucky, Baffert persuaded owner Prince Ahmed Bin Salman
to buy the colt.</TE>
<TE>   "When I got a call to see if I wanted a Derby horse, I said,
'Damn!'" Baffert said.</TE>
<TE>   So what if he would have him for only a few weeks. So what if
people would give former trainer Frank Springer as much credit as
Baffert.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had my friends start crying even before the horse runs in
the Derby," Baffert said. "Before I knew I was going to the Derby, I
had my shrink on call. It's a special, special moment."</TE>
<TE>   Then once in the race, Baffert pulled a fumblerooski by persuading
owner Mike Pegram to enter Danthebluegrassman on Wednesday, at the
last possible minute, long after everyone had considered the field
closed.</TE>
<TE>   The entry knocked lower-earning Windward Passage out of the race,
raising eyebrows among those who remembered that Windward Passage's
owner, Barry Irwin, works with trainer Jenine Sahadi.</TE>
<TE>   Remember who Baffert insulted a couple of years ago at the Santa
Anita Derby? A remark apparently questioning Sahadi's competence
caused him more grief than a pair of broken blinkers.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Irwin said, "Bob Baffert can't allow anyone else to
have their 15 minutes of fame, no matter who the individual is. I
don't think Jenine has the problem. I think he has the problem."</TE>
<TE>   It was no surprise that some horse folks think Danthebluegrassman
is in the race not because of achievement, but revenge.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not my fault that people didn't notice my horse was working
out here, or that he was eligible," Baffert said.</TE>
<TE>   "When I thought he was ready, I entered him. What's wrong with
that?"</TE>
<TE>   The answer, of course, is nothing.</TE>
<TE>   The racing community needs to put a feedbag on it.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Baffert is one of only a few horse folks recognized outside of
a barn.</TE>
<TE>   Racing doesn't need less of him, it needs more.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy is the best trainer in his field," Pegram said. "All the
rest is bull."</TE>
<TE>   Baffert has been plagued with twitters about his divorce. Yet does
anybody ask those same questions about Laker Coach Phil Jackson?</TE>
<TE>   Baffert has been ripped for talking too much in the press. Yet
isn't that what everyone in the publicity-starved thoroughbred world
should be doing?</TE>
<TE>   Some feel outside distractions are affecting his work. Yet he's
still fifth nationally in purses, and has the longest current
Kentucky Derby trainer streak, seven consecutive years.</TE>
<TE>   "We need our own people in this business to stop knocking each
other," Baffert said. "All they do is knock, when we should be trying
to sell."</TE>
<TE>   During one group interview session this week outside Baffert's
barn, a horse broke free and began galloping toward the writers.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody move!" Baffert shouted. "The horse won't run at us if we
don't move."</TE>
<TE>   Everyone stood still. The horse ran past the group. Baffert
continued the interview.</TE>
<TE>   "Geez," said one bystander, clearly surprised. "That guy really
knows something about horses."</TE>

<HD>HIV Cases Must Be Reported, With Patient Codes, Not Names</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Doctors and laboratories for the first time will be required to
report newly diagnosed cases of HIV to public health officials,
California health officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Under the new system, which takes effect July 1, medical providers
would use numerical codes rather than names to correspond to
HIV-positive patients.</LD>
<LD>   That approach, which is highly controversial, differs from the
practices of 33 other states, which track patients by name
confidentially. It also differs from the way California itself tracks
80 other diseases, including full-blown AIDS.</LD>
<TE>   The new system has been the subject of vigorous debate in the
state since 1998 when then-Gov. Pete Wilson vetoed legislation that
would have created a similar code-based system.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents, including many AIDS activists, say it will allow cases
to be tracked without compromising patients' privacy. Opponents say
it will be unwieldy and confusing and will complicate efforts to
trace the sexual partners of patients with HIV.</TE>
<TE>   The system is needed to provide a more accurate gauge of HIV
transmission, state officials say. AIDS case reports offer little
insight into the level of HIV infection because it can take 10 or
more years for an HIV-positive person to develop AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   The tracking system will put health officials in a better position
to distribute money for HIV and AIDS treatments, services, education
and prevention programs. Currently, money is targeted to programs
largely based upon anecdotal information and AIDS statistics.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very pleased with the system that we've developed," said
Michael Montgomery, chief of the Office of AIDS within the state
Department of Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that we're going to please everyone," Montgomery
said, "but I would hope that as information gets out," people will
see its benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Critics, pointing to problems experienced by other states using
codes say the new system is destined to fail. They argue that if
authorities are to reduce the number of new HIV infections, they must
know the names of HIV patients so they can help them find treatment
and notify their partners.</TE>
<TE>   "We think that the inability of health departments to get in touch
with and work with the people who are infected misses a great
opportunity to prevent further transmission," said Dr. Ron Hattis, a
Redlands physician who is secretary-treasurer of Physicians for HIV
Control.</TE>
<TE>   Gay leaders and civil rights advocates disagree, saying disclosure
of names would violate patients' privacy and discourage testing.</TE>
<TE>   "We really feel that people still have fears of disclosure," said
Rebecca Isaacs, managing director of the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian
Center. "There's still stigma around HIV."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Gary Cohan, a Beverly Hills physician who treats many HIV
patients, said the new regulations are long overdue. "There's been a
lot of foot dragging," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new reporting system, laboratories would assign a
patient a code if a test shows the presence of HIV.</TE>
<TE>   The code would be based on the patient's birth date, gender and
the consonants contained in his or her last name.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, the physician would add the last four digits of the
patient's Social Security number to the code and would report it to
the local health agency.</TE>
<TE>   Patients who receive testing at anonymous sites, where they don't
provide their names, won't be subject to the new regulations.</TE>
<TE>   The CDC asked states in December 1998 to track HIV infection as an
integral part of their AIDS reporting programs, urging that
individuals be identified by name but allowing states to use codes.</TE>
<TE>   Federal health officials, though, have said that systems not using
names don't work as well.</TE>
<TE>   Only Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Vermont and
Puerto Rico use HIV-reporting codes.</TE>
<TE>   Maine, Oregon and Washington have systems in which the names of
HIV-positive patients are initially reported but later replaced with
codes.</TE>
<TE>   The California Legislature approved the use of codes as part of
its 2000-01 budget bill. The state Office of AIDS proposed its first
set of regulations more than a year ago. They cleared their final
hurdle Thursday when the state Office of Administrative Law approved
them.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Anti-Muslim incidents in the United States have tripled
in the past year, according to a report released this week by the
Council on American-Islamic Relations.</LD>
<LD>   The Washington-based Islamic advocacy group said it received 1,125
credible complaints from Muslim community members and organizations
compared with 366 the previous year.</LD>
<LD>   The seventh annual report, "The Status of Muslim Civil Rights in
the United States: Stereotypes and Civil Liberties," details reports
to CAIR of discrimination, harassment, threat, assaults and murder
from March 2001 to the same month this year.</LD>
<TE>   It is the first compilation of reports by the group since the
Sept.11 terror attacks on the East Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Mohamed Nimer, research director of CAIR, said the group receives
complaints daily, but only considers a report valid if the victim can
report details of the incident accurately.</TE>
<TE>   Cited in the report was a Dec. 24, 2001, incident in which a
Muslim woman boarding an American Airlines flight in Lincoln, Neb.,
said she was asked by security personnel to remove her head cover in
front of other passengers before boarding a plane--a violation of her
religious belief prohibiting women from showing their hair in front
of men.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate incident, the report said, an Arab American was shot
in the back four times as he was closing his store in Chattanooga,
Tenn., on Jan. 24.</TE>
<TE>   Nimer said the organization received 11 to 70 complaints a day in
the eight weeks that followed the September attacks, compared with an
average of three calls on normal days.</TE>

<AU>JOEL JOHN ROBERTS</AU>
<BD>Joel John Roberts is the executive director of PATH.
(People Assisting The Homeless), a regional homeless agency.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mayor James K. Hahn's new annual budget is basically a carbon copy of
previous years and makes a dismally low investment in assisting the
homeless.</LD>
<LD>   I recently was a panelist on Gov. Gray Davis' first-ever Summit on
Homelessness, where I was proud that California was taking a lead in
ending homelessness--including backing up words with dollars through
a proposed $2.1-billion housing bond. I hoped Hahn would join this
effort in ending homelessness by investing more city money in our
community effort.</LD>
<LD>   Homelessness affects those who live on the streets and those who
simply walk by them. We all see them--men on the freeway ramps
carrying tattered cardboard signs with scrawled messages; older women
hunched over rickety shopping carts pushing their life's possessions;
families living in parked cars. Shelter Partnership, a nonprofit
research and advocacy agency, says there are 84,000 homeless people
on Los Angeles County streets on any given night, and yet there are
only about 13,000 shelter beds available.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County sheriff wants to build a drop-in center for
mentally ill homeless people near downtown. And the county opens up a
limited number of emergency shelter beds when the weather is cold or
rainy. But this is only a small battle within a larger war.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco sterilizes its sidewalks, cleans off discarded items
and tells the homeless to move on. The critics say that their streets
are mean and violate a homeless person's civil rights.</TE>
<TE>   Do homeless people have the right to sleep on our city's streets
and sidewalks? When people fall through the cracks of society, don't
they have the right to at least be able to sleep in a public park? Or
are businesses and residential neighborhoods justified in their claim
that homeless people scare away customers and decrease property
values? It's a tough call.</TE>
<TE>   New York City invested $530 million and guarantees a shelter bed
for every homeless person within the city limits. The city of Los
Angeles' financial commitment to the homeless is barely a blip on the
radar screen.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's commitment to $100 million for the Housing Trust Fund is a
terrific step in waging war on the terrible conditions on our
streets. But we need more.</TE>
<TE>   We are all tired. The homeless are tired of surviving day by day
on the streets. And our community is tired of seeing this human
blight day after day.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Los Angeles must fight this war on two fronts. For the
community's sake, we need to follow San Francisco's model of cleaning
our sidewalks and streets so that the whole community can live in a
safe, clean and secure homeland. As a compassionate and responsible
community, however, we can do this only if we follow New York's model
of providing a bed for every homeless person.</TE>
<TE>   There is a solution. Clean streets, but not mean streets. Clean
our streets and also provide a shelter bed for every homeless person.
in the city. It's a balanced and fair approach that allows our whole
city to live in a safe and secure world.</TE>

<HD>When Stars Light Up, Does It Cloud Teens' Vision?</HD>
<DH>Some young people see through the ruse. For them, smoking
in movies and TV is totally uncool.</DH>

<LD>Are teenagers influenced to smoke when they see characters in movies
and on TV light up? Designed to entertain and educate a primary
audience of teens and young adults, an exhibit at the Hollywood
Entertainment Museum, "Smoke, Lies &amp; Videotape," explores smoking's
novel history in the mass media, from the days of the early
nickelodeon theaters to modern-day movies and TV. The exhibit will
run until Dec. 31. SAMANTHA and BARBARA MACLAREN spoke with teens
about the entertainment industry's role in determining whether they
would smoke. For information about the exhibit, call (323) 465-7900.</LD>

<TE>   I do not smoke but I have friends who do. I do think smoking on TV
and in the movies persuades teens to smoke because it's made to look
cool. In the movies, the characters who smoke look more mature, and I
think younger teenagers who don't know any better think they will
look more mature by doing the same.</TE>
<TE>   If no one on TV or the big screen smoked, then whether kids were
influenced wouldn't even be an issue. And I don't think the TV shows
or movies would lose their realism because nowadays a lot of people
don't smoke.</TE>
<TE>   Smoking in magazines, books and movies is all the same. I
personally think teens smoke more because of peer pressure, because
if a person sees most of their friends doing it, then they are going
to also. But why is it necessary for movies to show smoking as
glamorous and cool?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   REBECCA RENTERIA, 18,</TE>
<TE>   recent graduate of Bassett High School, La Puente</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes movies and TV influence how teens will behave, but not
always. Sure, teens see smoking on TV and in the movies, but even
without that the tobacco industry would find a way to have their ads
reach teens.</TE>
<TE>   I think that smoking should be banned not only from TV but
altogether. I mean, what is the point of smoking? It makes people
sick. How about a TV show or movie that shows what smoking really
does to people?</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure if movies are like ads for products, but I do think
that they support whatever they show. If they did ban smoking from
the entertainment industry, it would help some but not everyone.
Those who smoke are already addicted.</TE>
<TE>   I like the anti-cigarette ads that make a point such as the one
with two teens--a guy and a girl--and the guy approaches the girl,
then she pulls out a cigarette and puts it in her mouth, then it
shows her as a fish. That ad is good to have on TV because it shows
people what you really look like when you smoke.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AMBER WADE, 14,</TE>
<TE>   Hoover High School, Glendale</TE>
<TE>   I do not smoke and I don't plan to. I do have friends that smoke
and I don't really know why, but the reason they smoke is because
they chose to. In a way I feel that smoking in movies and on TV
influences teens to smoke, but the main reason that anyone smokes is
because he or she wants to and made that choice.</TE>
<TE>   I think that smoking should be banned from TV, but it wouldn't
really make any difference; people who smoke would smoke even if they
didn't see it on TV. I think that movies that contain people smoking
are just the same as cigarette ads, because the companies pay the
movies to use their cigarettes so people will buy them.</TE>

<HD>Seeking Answers From Science and Faith About the Final Days
of Earth</HD>
<DH>THE GOD OF HOPE AND THE END OF THE WORLD; By John
Polkinghorne; Yale University Press: 154 pp., $19.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN KIRSCH</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Kirsch, a contributing writer for the Los
Angeles Times Book Review, is the author of, most recently, "The
Woman Who Laughed at God: The Untold History of the Jewish People."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eschatology is the study of "the end times"--the end of history, the
end of humankind, the end of the world. Once the exclusive concern of
theologians and philosophers, the subject has attracted the attention
of astronomers and physicists who debate among themselves about when
the sun will burn out and whether the cosmos will collapse on itself.</LD>
<LD>   John Polkinghorne, however, insists that theology--and,
specifically, Christian theology--is a source of wisdom and insight
that science simply cannot provide in contemplating the question of
what will happen when the world finally comes to an end, as religion
and science agree that it will.</LD>
<LD>   "The thesis of this book is that Christian belief provides the
essential resource for answering this fundamental question,"
Polkinghorne says in "The God of Hope and the End of the World."
"Ultimately the issue is whether we live in a world that makes sense
not just now, but totally and forever."</LD>
<TE>   Polkinghorne is a theologian and a scientist (he is a priest and a
physicist), and his previous books include "Belief in God in an Age
of Science" and "Faith, Science and Understanding." His new book is a
kind of summing-up of the work of the religious and scientific
scholars, Polkinghorne among them, who gathered at Princeton
University over three years under the auspices of the Center of
Theological Inquiry to "reconsider, in the light of modern knowledge,
the expression of Christian eschatological hope concerning the end of
the world and concerning the fulfillment of the divine purpose for
creation."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the intellectual trapdoor under all religious discourse
about the end times is the simple fact that it is purely subjective
and wholly speculative--and, by definition, cannot be otherwise.
That's the real difference between science and theology, a difference
that the author seems to concede--after all, we can see the distant
past and outermost reaches of the cosmos with our own eyes through a
telescope, but no one has yet glimpsed what Polkinghorne calls,
almost longingly, "a destiny beyond death."</TE>
<TE>   Polkinghorne insists that science, too, ultimately bumps up
against the unknown and the unknowable. "[B]oth science and
theology," he writes, "have to express their belief in the existence
of unseen realities, be they confined quarks forever hidden within
nuclear matter or be it the invisible reality of the divine
presence."</TE>
<TE>   He is honest enough to concede that science and theology can never
be fully harmonized, but he insists that true belief is ultimately
more illuminating than the scientific method.</TE>
<TE>   "[N]atural science can do no more than present us with the
contrast of a finely tuned and fruitful universe which is condemned
to ultimate futility," he witnesses to his readers without a trace of
irony, adding: "[T]heology bases its postmortem hope on a reality
inaccessible to scientific investigation, the faithfulness of the
living God."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, when Polkinghorne shares his musings on "the life of the
world to come," focusing on what he calls "the Four Last Things:
Death; Judgement; Heaven; Hell," he exits the world of science and
enters the world of metaphysics, the very same counting of angels on
a pinhead that once occupied the attention of medieval theologians.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other contemporary writers who struggle to find linkages
between faith and reason, religion and science, he rejects "shallow
scientific triumphalism" and falls back on true belief of a very
specific kind.</TE>
<TE>   "Christian belief must not lose its nerve about eschatological
hope," he says. "A credible theology depends upon it and, in turn, a
Trinitarian and incarnational theology can assure us of its
credibility."</TE>
<TE>   Polkinghorne's argument ultimately relies on a leap of faith that
many of his readers may not be prepared to make.</TE>
<TE>   But it is not faith alone that motivates the author--he declares
himself unsatisfied by "implausible airy fantasies" about the end of
the world and life after death, and he goes in search of a Christian
eschatology that is "intelligible and defensible in the 21st
century."</TE>
<TE>   Here Polkinghorne betrays a measure of chutzpah that is refreshing
if somewhat at odds with his solemn declaration of faith: He demands
of God a world and a world to come that make sense.</TE>
<TE>   He is hardly the first mere mortal to call God to task--it's a
tradition that begins with the biblical Abraham--but his argument may
remind the reader of Niels Bohr's retort to Albert Einstein's famous
remark that God does not play dice with the universe: "Einstein," he
scolded, "stop telling God what to do!"</TE>

<LD>Californians long have disparaged the idea of a high-speed train as
something both quaint and futuristic. Fine for France or Japan
perhaps, but not for the vast Golden State, where the auto rules. The
cost seemed outlandish, and commuter flights were so convenient. But
that was then; now, traffic-choked, airport-deficient California is
more ready to consider a high-speed rail network.</LD>
<LD>   The California High-Speed Rail Authority, created by the
Legislature in 1996, has developed plans for a 700-mile system that
would cost $25billion over two decades.</LD>
<LD>   The system's sleek trains would be expected to speed passengers in
comfort at 200 mph or more--taking just 21/2 hours to travel from
downtown Los Angeles to downtown San Francisco.</LD>
<TE>   The first and key leg would have 400 miles of high-speed track
from Los Angeles to San Jose, costing an estimated $12 billion. Half
of the money would come from a state bond issue, proposed by Sen. Jim
Costa (D-Fresno) and slated to be put to state voters as early as
November. Costa's SB 1856 faces its first hearing Tuesday. The rest
of the money would come from federal transportation matching funds
and potential private sources such as parking lot operators and the
manufacturers of the train equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The California train is not fantasy. France has operated its
popular TGVs for more than 20 years at speeds averaging up to 186
mph, with test runs as high as 320 mph. Germany runs 216 trains daily
at up to 200 mph. A popular rail guide calls the trains "big, bold
and beautiful with an emphasis on passenger comfort." Amtrak's
popular new Acela train in the Northeast, although not as fast,
features electric outlets, phone booths and video and audio
entertainment in first-class sections. Acela ridership in the
Boston-Washington corridor equals that of commuter air service.</TE>
<TE>   The cost is within reason. Compare the $6-billion bond issue with
the more than $10 billion that the State Water Project, approved in
1960, would have cost in today's dollars. It is well within the
state's bonding capacity.</TE>
<TE>   Rail service would ease congestion at airports and on freeways and
potentially contribute to downtown redevelopment efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Would Californians use the service? Southern California's
Metrolink commuter trains prove that they will, if they get fast,
comfortable service at competitive rates. There may be some concern
about safety since the April 23 wreck in Orange County, but
high-speed rail systems worldwide, running on dedicated track, have
compiled remarkable safety records.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak is struggling with losses nationally but lists California
as one of its best ridership markets.</TE>
<TE>   There is no longer a major dispute over which system to pursue.
Magnetic levitation, once touted as the future of rail, has lost out
because steel-wheel trains can travel on conventional tracks.</TE>
<TE>   There are wild cards in the scenario, including Amtrak's iffy
future and the question of Washington's willingness to help foot the
bill. The Legislature could delay a vote until 2004. But the argument
for better rail service between California's major cities has never
been stronger.</TE>

<HD>The D.A.'s Press Attack</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Metropolitan News-Enterprise is a tiny newspaper, filled with
legal notices and focusing on the doings of local courts and
government. It prints only 2,500 copies daily, which circulate mostly
among downtown politicians and bureaucrats. The newspaper's small
office near the Los Angeles Civic Center is sandwiched between a copy
store and a snack shop. Some mornings, reporters and editors arrive
to discover that thugs have once again scratched gang logos into the
newspaper's large windows overnight. Thursday, unwelcome visitors
came in broad daylight--officials sent by L.A. County District Atty.
Steve Cooley--but their behavior was no less outrageous than the
vandals'.</LD>
<LD>   Marching in with a search warrant, investigators shut down the
newspaper for three hours Thursday, ordering reporters and editors
out to the sidewalk. The investigators came looking for proof that a
local law firm paid for an ad in the paper more than two months ago.
The ad was a legal notice of a recall election in South Gate that is
part of a broad political corruption probe in that city. Metropolitan
News owner Roger M. Grace said the agents initially told him the
search could last up to three days and that reporters' desks would be
searched unless Grace handed over the ad invoice and other documents,
which he and his wife finally did.</LD>
<TE>   Federal law and California's shield law protect reporters from
having to produce their notes, sources and other news-related
documents as part of a criminal investigation and arguably can cover
legal notices. Cooley's warrant was written so broadly, potentially
extending to reporters' notes and documents, that the judge who
granted it should have thrown it out on that ground alone.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley's office said the search was necessary to learn the name of
the law firm that placed the notice. But since investigators were at
the same time rummaging through the law firm's files, it would seem
they already knew.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley's invasion of the Metropolitan News evokes images from
countries where newspapers either toe the government's line or find
their offices padlocked and their reporters jailed. We'd bet the
district attorney would never try this kind of intimidation at the
Los Angeles Times or some other large newspaper. He was absolutely
wrong to do it to the Metropolitan News.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Finally, after years of neglect, California has rallied to help
children whose parents don't pay child support. Yet Washington
continues to punish the state--and ultimately those same
children--because the child support enforcement system, though
revamped, still has flaws.</LD>
<LD>   The state can't get relief from heavy federal fines because it
lacks a single, statewide computerized system, which Washington
funded years ago. Yes, the federal government required California to
have it up and running by 1996. Yes, the state missed the deadline.
But heavy penalties are no longer needed to prod California to do a
better job of getting support payments to children.</LD>
<LD>   More children are getting monthly support even in Los Angeles
County, which, before the state takeover of these services, had an
abysmal record. In 1998, a Times investigation found that the L.A.
district attorney's office failed to collect any money in nine out of
10 child support cases. That, despite 1,500 employees, a $100-million
budget and powers rivaling the Internal Revenue Service, which can
find almost anyone.</LD>
<TE>   Children today get paid in one out of three cases in L.A. County,
and four of 10 statewide. The California Legislature and Gov. Gray
Davis removed the responsibility from county prosecutors and two
years ago created a new state department. Soon, parents who didn't do
right by their children lost chunks of their paychecks and tax
refunds.</TE>
<TE>   The state collected $2 billion last year. Two-thirds went directly
to families. That's a shift from the system's former emphasis on
collecting money to repay county welfare departments for public
assistance checks cashed long ago--so long that the children who had
so needed the money were now grandparents themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The new state system has more than doubled the average collected
per deadbeat dad or mom, to $1,015 per case. It has established
paternity for more babies born to unwed parents, so that child
support collections, if necessary, will be easier. The system also
increased collection of current and past due support.</TE>
<TE>   Another improvement assures that innocent men--including those
misidentified as negligent fathers because of common last names or
those who have already paid up and no longer belong in the
system--can get formal resolution of their complaints in 30 days.
That compares with the years such people wasted under the old system
trying to correct costly errors, often without success.</TE>
<TE>   Washington should reward California for this progress. Instead, it
demands that 30 cents of every dollar the state spends on such
improvements be diverted to the federal government. That removes the
state's incentive to invest money to fix the problems or move beyond
the status quo.</TE>
<TE>   The federal fine is expected to top $180 million this year.
Congress should cut the fine so that more money can be spent more
quickly on more children.</TE>

<HD>School Mascots Show a Fighting Spirit</HD>

<LD>Re "Bill Would Ban Indian Mascots," May 1: I understand and agree
that names like Redskins, Indians and even Chiefs would be considered
derogatory to Native Americans in most contexts. But Commanches?
Apaches? When a school selects a mascot, the football team and the
competitive spirit of the school have much to do with the choice. The
school wants a fighting spirit, a name that makes it proud.</LD>
<LD>   The Commanches and Apaches were fearless fighters who persisted
against overwhelming odds. They are admired, as a part of their
culture, for their fighting abilities, both intertribal and against
the U.S. westward expansion. Other groups are admired (and used as
mascots) for their similar histories: Spartans, Vandals, Vikings,
Huns, etc. As mascots, all are cartoon-like figures that run up and
down the field doing idiotic things to get the fans to cheer.</LD>
<LD>   I have yet to hear anyone say the Commanche mascot looked stupider
than the Spartan mascot doing those things. What next? Greek
attorneys beating us up to paint over the Spartan symbol on the local
high school or suing for mental distress?</LD>

<TE>   Kudos to state Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg for her bill to ban
Native American sports mascots. This practice is an insult to Native
Americans and those of Native American descent such as myself. We
would be shocked if someone put on a public minstrel show, and
rightly so. Dancing around in a cartoonish Indian suit to amuse
sports crowds is no different. It's long past time our nation started
showing proper respect for Native Americans and their culture.</TE>

<TE>   In high school, in the late '50s, I was proud to be a Mark Keppel
Aztec. The depiction was a strong warrior. In the early '60s I was a
bulldog mascot for the University of Redlands. My partner bulldog and
I made our heads out of ice cream cartons and gray flannel, and we
wore gray tights and blouses with maroon jumpers. The week before we
were to play Whittier College in football, "Pound the Poets" signs
were posted all over campus. I seem to remember having one pinned to
my bloomers to show when I flipped up the back of my jumper during
the game. A guest speaker on campus that week was Robert Frost. His
sense of humor at the irony of the coincidence endeared him to us.</TE>
<TE>   So here's a novel thought: Laugh! Get with the spirit of students
who enjoy supporting their schools' teams.</TE>

<TE>   The goals of the legislation may be reasonable enough, but the
idea that the state government can limit the choices for team mascots
made by student governments and local school boards sounds like a
clear violation of the rights of Americans to freedom of speech and
expression. I find it alarming that nobody quoted reflected on
whether the state government should be involved in this kind of
censorship.</TE>

<LD>Re "Big Noise, Modest Result," editorial, May 1: I am mystified by
your inability to acknowledge the most obvious benefits to be derived
from the use of ethanol. You rehash the same arguments you have made
time and time again--against pork barrel ("corn bushel") politics and
the perception that ethanol is "unneeded," since new methods of
reformulating gasoline eliminate MTBE without using ethanol to meet
clean-air standards.</LD>
<LD>   Ethanol is the best available option as an alternate fuel that can
lead us away from oil dependence on the volatile whims of OPEC and
the Middle East. Along with its clean-burning attributes, ethanol,
unlike oil, is a renewable source of energy that can be grown and
harvested annually without fear of exhausting a finite source of
supply.</LD>

lived in Compton when I was born in 1963. I grew up in Wilmington,
where the sound of fog horns from the harbor lulled me to sleep at
night. So did the sounds of explosions and gunshots. By 1992, I lived
in Victorville and watched the riots on TV, terrified that I could
have easily been in Reginald Denny's place, had I happened to be
"down the hill" that day.</LD>
<LD>   In 1997, I left Southern California for good. The 10-year
anniversary of the riots leaves me sad and angry. L.A. is still my
city. It is still home. I am a white woman who never fully
comprehended what my neighbors of other ethnic origins were going
through. I was raised without prejudice, taught to treat all the
different people who surrounded me with respect and consideration.
That attitude proved to be a blindfold to the reality of what was
going on. The riots brought fully to my attention the disparities
that exist in L.A. Afterward, I began to notice when my African
American friends commented about being pulled over more by police, or
my Hispanic friends told stories of racism, or my Asian friends
vented their frustration regarding the same issues. I am now more
aware of the reality of life in L.A. for all its residents. At first
the riots seemed to be an overreaction, but it was only in retrospect
that I could see they were, in fact, long overdue.</LD>

<TE>   I read in disbelief the April 29 story on the Times poll on racial
attitudes among various segments of the population. What I found
incredible, both in the context of the uprising 10 years ago, in
which Korean Americans bore the full brunt of the riots and in light
of the dramatic growth of Asian Americans in L.A. and California, was
that The Times did not bother to ask in sufficient number and to
report how Asian Americans perceive race relations.</TE>
<TE>   It's as if Asian Americans do not matter and the destruction of
hundreds of predominantly Korean-owned businesses was irrelevant.
This neglect speaks volumes about how much more Americans of Asian or
Pacific ancestry still have to overcome just to be accepted as
full-fledged citizens of this nation. It is a sad comment on race
relations indeed.</TE>

<TE>   The American right of protest for a just cause was correctly
demonstrated by the initial demonstrators against the Rodney King
verdict. But their cause was lost when people began looting the
innocent storekeepers in their own neighborhoods and beyond.
Following that, the demonstrators became just another mob of
law-breaking thieves.</TE>

<TE>   Every car that passes by, every house we set our eyes on, everyone
in this free, blessed land seems to chant "God bless America." This
is the phrase that keeps us going in the hardest of times, when life
for us "ain't no crystal stair" (Langston Hughes).</TE>
<TE>   But around April 29 this powerful phrase becomes harder to say,
for on April 29 several years ago a blow struck at the hearts, the
wealth and the minds of the Koreans residing in Koreatown. On that
day, when rioters stormed the city, looting money, merchandise and
food, throwing homemade grenades made of bottles containing alcohol
and fire and scaring thousands to the depths of hell, the police
refused to answer the screams for help. They refused to act because
we--Koreans--are not white.</TE>
<TE>   There's no use denying that there was discrimination in their
inertia--it's true. April 29 showed that life in America is the best,
but for whites only, not for any others. This is why those precious
words, "God bless America," cannot ring throughout the nation.</TE>

<TE>   I can well sympathize with those worn down by the futility of
attempting to revitalize areas adjacent to downtown ("How the Looters
Stole a Dream," April 26).Eighteen months ago my wife and I purchased
a large, 1925 Mediterranean-style house near Beverly Boulevard and
Vermont Avenue. But the trash-strewn streets, the ever-present
graffiti, the incessant horn-honking and car alarms, the drunks and
gangbangers strutting about brazenly and the general disdain that
many recent immigrants display for civic values have left us
disheartened.</TE>
<TE>   This past week two parked cars owned by Asian students living with
us were struck by illegal immigrants without insurance. Our attempts
to seek restitution have been met with blank intransigence, forcing
us to seek aid from police and other agencies that are too busy to
assist in a timely manner. It seems that the Rampart Division is,
understandably, more concerned with responding to violent crime than
with enforcing quality-of-life issues.</TE>
<TE>   In my opinion, the only effective way to deal with these
miscreants is through a massive civic education policy, combined with
strict code enforcement.</TE>

<TE>   Here's how far we've come: Recently I was driving on Highland in
Hancock Park when I witnessed a Korean American driver of a Mercedes
rear-end the van of an African American driver. Instead of coming to
blows, they got out, saw there was no damage and actually hugged and
smiled as they said goodbye.</TE>
<TE>   There has been a lot of healing in this city in the last 10 years,
which I've also seen at the big Promise Keepers events at the
Coliseum, in which tens of thousands of men of all races stood arm in
arm and repented and apologized to each other for racism. We're on
the right track.</TE>

<LD>It was such a pleasant surprise to read Muhammad Yunus and Roshaneh
Zafar's April 29 commentary, "Help Poor Women to Help Themselves."
Yunus, as too few people know, began the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh
25 years ago with several loans amounting to a total of about $30
(the smallest being $1) to four or five poor women. Today the Grameen
Bank lends close to $1 billion annually in amounts averaging $60.</LD>
<LD>   I was honored to shake Mr. Yunus' hand several years ago at a talk
he gave in Pasadena. I have never met such a warm and humble man. If
creativity of ideas and impact on the world's poorest people are of
any consideration to the people who give the Nobel Peace Prize, then
Yunus should top the list.</LD>
<LD>   When everyone is looking for ways to reduce threats of terror in
this world, to overlook or minimize the ideas that Yunus and, now,
quite a few other organizations are putting into practice is
inexcusable. If you share the idea that small amounts of money should
be made available to poor women, visit  www.microcreditsummit.org and
take an action, like writing your senator or representative.</LD>

small loans for self-employment. Surely some clever budget analyst in

<DL></DL>
<LD>Jay Taylor failed to discuss the most likely scenario in
U.S.-China-Taiwan relations for the 21st century ("Bush Scraps China
Policy of Six Presidents," Opinion, April 28). The "one China" policy
pressed by the People's Republic of China since it won mainland China
by force in 1949 now benefits Chinese worldwide, especially those in
Taiwan, more than ever. In the 21st century, "one China" will replace
the U.S. as the world power or at least dictate the terms under which
we exercise that power.</LD>
<LD>   To Chinese everywhere there is a justifiable bond of history and
culture. Our continuing supply of advanced weapons to Taiwan together
with our strong business ties, in response to the Bush
administration's repeated pledges to do "whatever it takes" to
protect Taiwan from mainland China, is contrary to U.S. long-term
interests. In the meantime, Taiwanese Chinese strengthen their
business ties with mainland China dramatically, as Taylor points out.
And why shouldn't they?</LD>
<TE>   Blood and business are thicker than politics. And on the
chessboard of world politics, all the military hardware and expertise
and financial ties we have shared with Taiwan will appear in the
arsenal of the PRC in any serious power or economic showdown between
the U.S. and China. With the current administration's simplistic view
of things, expect the Chinese to continue to use the good-cop
(Taiwan), bad-cop (mainland China) tactic to their strong advantage
against us.</TE>

<LD>Even though I am probably the last person to compliment President
Bush, I must commend him for his efforts to have mental illness
recognized as a disease like any other ("Mental Health Parity Urged,"
April 30.) If we as a society are to truly address the issue of
mental illness we must stop treating the subject as taboo. Only then
can we work on making the lives of mentally ill people and their
families better.</LD>
<LD>   But I marvel at the fact that this issue was first trumpeted by
his electoral opponent, Al Gore. Is Bush, in fact, co-opting a
Democratic Party issue? If so, it looks like Bush is taking a page
from Clinton's book on how to stay in office: co-opt every issue.</LD>

<HD>Saldivar Gives His Profession a Black Eye</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a registered respiratory therapist with 14 years of experience, I
read with unmitigated loathing the antics surrounding the "angel of
death," Efren Saldivar, in "Graveyard Shift" (April 28-29). Not only
does Saldivar represent a human failure but also the failure of a
respiratory department to exercise cross-checks within the department
itself. He has single-handedly given a black eye to an honorable
profession that, in my experience, has always exercised the highest
degree of professional and personal integrity.</LD>

<TE>   As president of the California Society for Respiratory Care, a
volunteer organization representing respiratory therapists in
California, I am concerned with the portrayal of our profession.
While this article may describe one group of therapists, it is
definitely not the norm for the other 20,000 California therapists
and hundreds of thousands across the world. The CSRC, along with our
national organization, condemns any illegal or unethical acts
performed by Saldivar or his co-workers. All therapists are not "like
high school kids." Yes, therapists enjoy their work and
accomplishments, but behind that joy they are dedicated, educated and
highly skilled professionals.</TE>
<TE>   Since Saldivar began his respiratory career in 1988, many facets
have changed. Among them is the minimum two-year AA degree required
to become a therapist in California--with a four-year requirement in
the near future. Today there is also mandatory reporting--for both
employees and employers who witness any unprofessional act by a
therapist--to the Respiratory Care Board.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Digging Deep for 'Angel's' Terrible Toll," April 29:
Congratulations to the Glendale Police Department and other involved
people for deciding to continue the investigation of Efren Saldivar.
Today's society tends to ignore the needs of the silent and helpless,
so it would have been easy to drop this case for excess cost or lack
of evidence. Special congratulations to Sgt. John McKillop, who acted
because he could not "trivialize" the lives of the "vulnerable . . .
elderly in the hospital." When he first became a police officer,
McKillop took an oath to protect all people, and his efforts in this
case indeed show how seriously he saw his profession.</TE>
<TE>   Congratulations to The Times for choosing to dedicate so much
well-researched space to this story. Unlike the cases of O.J.
Simpson, Robert Blake or Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, this
"angel of death" story is truly sensational.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re an April 28 letter by Planaria Price: Project Avanzando, an
educational effort providing GED instruction to migrant and seasonal
workers, provides instruction in Spanish because available research
and our own practice demonstrate that the higher thinking skills
involved in studying and passing the exam are clearly transferable
between languages.</LD>
<LD>   As explained in "Program Helps Migrant Workers Earn a GED" (April
24), many of our adult students are able to prepare in about five
months, through intense study and dedication. After graduation they
improve their English skills at local community colleges, and many
continue higher education and training pursuits, which open the door
for more opportunities.</LD>
<LD>   These remarkable results are possible because they feel motivated
by obtaining their GED diploma in a relatively short period, which
increases their self-esteem and appreciation as capable learners, a
requirement for educational success at any level. We believe that
programs such as this, as well as Price's, provide valuable
opportunities for individual and community improvement and that many
more--not fewer--of these efforts are needed to serve our diverse
communities.</LD>

<HD>Balzar on Internet Anonymity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Balzar's poorly thought-out diatribe against Internet anonymity
is astonishing and unworkable (Commentary, April 28). How many
thousands of John Balzars are there in the world? Would he be willing
to give out his Social Security number for distinction among them?
Maybe his home address? His phone number? Who would administer this?
What if someone takes his address and throws a firebomb at his home?</LD>
<LD>   I look forward to seeing Balzar expand on this. Where would the
bureau of Internet privacy (as opposed to anonymity) house its
troops?</LD>
<LD>   What darkness lurks on the Web? Is it the darkness of collapsing
scaffolding, or exploding booby traps, or a mugging? Or is it the
"evil" of an inconvenient virus, or hurt pride when someone with an
anonymous name defeats you in a chat room debate? Do spirits leap out
of your computer screen and take your soul into the darkness, or do
you log on and off under your own free will? Balzar needs to
reconsider his position or risk non-anonymous embarrassment.</LD>
<TE>   Conder Seasholtz</TE>
<TE>   Portland</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Balzar warns us that people's behavior changes when they know they
are anonymous and that anonymity is not the same as privacy. Yes,
some people's behavior changes, but I don't think this is a moral
question, as Balzar would have us believe. I believe that privacy and
individual rights are at the very core of the issue.</TE>
<TE>   It is just possible that in a society in which we are constantly
told (subtly and overtly) how to behave and what to value (witness
advertisements all around us, which, I might add, we're not able to
avoid), the Web represents the only public/social forum available
that allows us to experiment with identities different from those
assigned to us by society and express ideas not necessarily in
fashion at the moment. To force people to disclose personal and
legally identifiable selves on the Web in order to keep them from
temptation to be their "worst" is to allow society to once again
impinge on individual freedom of expression and further force us into
rigid roles and rules of behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Balzar accurately names the only safeguard necessary for those who
would be "victimized" (though this is a generous use of the term when
we're referring to people who must, in order to participate in Web
activities, actively choose to do so): education. This we do by
teaching users not "to regard everything on the Web as you might a
puff adder" but to seriously consider the source before believing the
information it offers. Education, not repression and punishment
("making it harder to be anonymous, marginalizing those who try"),
should be our goal.</TE>
<TE>   Most regular Web users are aware that everything on the Web must
be scrutinized. Personally, I don't feel I need to be "shielded" from
others' ideas. I would much rather take responsibility for myself by
viewing the Web with a critical and discerning eye. Balzar says we
must tear down "barriers," but his arguments against anonymity on the
Web would erect barriers that would silence us and keep us in line.
They are yet another example of the threat to individual freedom
represented by the current administration, which seems determined to
restrict individual rights and legislate morality.</TE>

<LD>Re "A Leap of Faith," Opinion, April 28: Jack Miles quotes Peter
Steinfels, saying that "observers of Catholicism are straining--and
failing--to find a comparable event against which to measure the
current crisis."</LD>
<LD>   Sexual shenanigans by members of the clergy are not new in the
21st century; widespread knowledge of those shenanigans is not a 21st
century phenomenon.</LD>
<LD>   Chaucer wrote about the dalliances of the friar--he seduced,
impregnated and "married off many a young woman--at his own expense.
He was a noble pillar of his order!" Moliere's Tartuffe attempted
seduction. In order for these literary works to make sense in their
times, there had to be general knowledge of clerical peccadilloes.</LD>
<TE>   Read and ye shall find that there is little new in the news.</TE>
<TE>   Gene Touchet</TE>
<TE>   Cathedral City</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Miles points out that Roman Catholics can easily find everything
except papal authority in another church. And so he left the church.
Although, as a Roman Catholic, I respect Miles' decision, may I point
out that there is one thing that no other church except the Roman
Catholic Church will ever have; namely, me and countless other
Catholics who will not abandon the church when it needs us most. It's
a "leap of faith," Mr. Miles--not hopscotch.</TE>
<TE>   Jeremiah J. Flanigan</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Miles' analysis of the "Catholic sex crisis of 1968" goes awry
when he argues that papal authority is invalid when it fails to meet
the "needs of the faithful." Since when are abortion and artificial
contraception "needs"? The desire to take another human life in order
to avoid inconveniencing one's own life qualifies as a selfish
desire, not a need. Paul VI's refusal to change the church's teaching
to fit modern political expediencies was perhaps the most courageous
exercise of papal authority to occur in the last century.</TE>
<TE>   Applying American democratic ideals to the church misses the point
and demonstrates the arrogance of those who would do so. To imagine
that today's American Catholics, ill-formed in their faith and
immersed in our current corrupt culture, know more about objective
moral truth than a church established by Jesus Christ that has
exercised unbroken papal authority for the past centuries boggles the
mind. Those who disagree can join a Protestant denomination. I pray
that the American Catholic Church does not follow Miles' advice.</TE>

<HD>Algerian National's Identity a Mystery</HD>
<DH>Probe: Suspect held on false document charges has given at
least three names since his arrest. The FBI is called in to
investigate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal authorities Friday were aggressively seeking the true
identity of an Algerian national arrested by Signal Hill police last
month on false document charges.</LD>
<LD>   The man, who initially gave his name as Ouiddir Saadi, is being
held on state charges of forging an official seal, using a false
document to conceal citizenship, making deceptive identification and
forgery of automobile ownership.</LD>
<LD>   A preliminary hearing has been scheduled for May 15 in Los Angeles
County Superior Court in Long Beach.</LD>
<TE>   In the meantime, the FBI has been searching state and federal
databases seeking information on the man, believed to be 35, who has
given at least three names since his arrest by Signal Hill police on
April 17.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the FBI was alerted shortly after the man first
appeared in a Long Beach courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   "Prosecutors were twice told privately by someone in the courtroom
that it would be wise to investigate this person further," said Sandi
Gibbons, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney's
office.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked to Signal Hill police, and their investigators found
more information," Gibbons said.</TE>
<TE>   That information included passports, photographs and documents
that led authorities to believe the man was likely to flee, according
to court documents.</TE>
<TE>   Signal Hill Police Chief Don Pedersen and the man's public
defender, Anthony Patalano, refused to talk about the case.</TE>
<TE>   On April 24, Deputy Dist. Atty. Lori Carnahan recommended that the
suspect be held without bail pending clarification of his background.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, bail for the man, described in court documents as an
illegal alien born in Algeria, was increased from $20,000 to
$100,000.</TE>

<HD>In U.S., Iraqi Couple's Artistry Gets Chance to Thrive</HD>
<DH>Culture: Suffering tragedy and punishment at home, they
finally fled and now find their works on exhibition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTEN CAMPBELL</AU>
<BD>RELIGION NEWS SERVICE</BD>
<DL>MOBILE, Ala.</DL>
<LD>Salma Mohammed Hasan has been through hell.</LD>
<LD>   The 38-year-old wife and mother endured years in war-torn Iraq
while her brother, her sister's children and one of her children
died.</LD>
<LD>   Her artwork, as well as that of her husband, was censored by the
government.</LD>
<TE>   Feeling threatened by the Iraqi authorities, she and her family
fled. Today, they live in Mobile.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like heaven," she says of the safe, verdant city so many
miles from all she has ever known.</TE>
<TE>   Now there is a new life, a new routine.</TE>
<TE>   Each weekday, Hasan and her husband, Ahmed Latif Magtof, get up,
send their three young children off to public school and head to work
at a local mill. At day's end, they come home, fix dinner and get the
children ready for bed.</TE>
<TE>   Then they draw.</TE>
<TE>   Their works are religious in nature, artistic illuminations of
passages from the Koran. Flowing Arabic text, accompanied by abstract
forms, declares God's greatness and mercy.</TE>
<TE>   "All talk about God," Hasan says of their artwork. "These pictures
talk about the good things in life. People sometimes forget what God
wants."</TE>
<TE>   For Muslims, the written word alone is considered a manifestation
of the divine. The physical text of the Koran is treated with
reverence, and its pages are to be protected from dirt or damage.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, some scholars make the comparison that the Koran is to
Muslims what Jesus himself is to Christians. Inscribing the sacred
syllables is not an act undertaken lightly.</TE>
<TE>   Because many early Islamic leaders believed that straightforward
depictions of persons or animals might imply idolatry, the theocracy
looked to calligraphy for religious expression, according to the
Islamic Arts &amp; Architecture Organization in Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   The shapes and sizes of words or letters, rather than
representational decorations, can be used to convey core convictions.
The script's vertical lines are believed to express majesty, while
the horizontal lines denote serenity.</TE>
<TE>   Hasan and Magtof do not talk about calligraphy's history or the
geometric principles that play an essential role in the Arabic art of
letters. Instead, Hasan says simply, "We try to make something good."</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi leaders didn't see it that way.</TE>
<TE>   Years ago, when the couple were still living in the Middle East,
they planned an art show. The exhibit followed violent episodes:
Hasan's brother was killed in the war between Iran and Iraq; her
sister's two children were killed when their house was bombed.</TE>
<TE>   Hasan said their art instructor advised them, "Try to paint what
you feel, what you suffer."</TE>
<TE>   A government official didn't like what he saw, effectively
canceling the show.</TE>
<TE>   They decided to leave Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Magtof left for Jordan. For more than a year, he lived
and worked there alone, sending money back to his family. During
those dark days, Hasan said, she and her children were "lost."</TE>
<TE>   "There was nothing," she said. "No future. No dream."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, when they had enough money, Hasan and the children
escaped. Piles of paperwork later, U.S. officials granted the family
refugee status. They arrived in Mobile in July 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "We come here. It is very difficult," said Hasan, who explained
that she had been taught to consider the United States an enemy. "The
children [asked]: 'Is that the new home for us, Mama? Is that the
United States?'"</TE>
<TE>   According to Hasan and Magtof, one of their greatest opportunities
here came from William Morris, owner of Morris Galleries.</TE>
<TE>   A few months ago, Morris agreed to give the couple space for an
exhibition at his Mobile studio.</TE>
<TE>   "We make all our hope and our dream in this show," Hasan said.
"When we meet Mr. Morris, we feel something die and get up in our
hearts. I think this is a very wonderful chance."</TE>
<TE>   Morris confessed that he was a bit hesitant to showcase the
artists' decidedly Islamic art after the events of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "My concern was pretty normal: How would this be perceived by the
public?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, "My heart was telling me: You really want to do
this."</TE>
<TE>   Morris said he thought about the words of Emma Lazarus' poem at
the base of the Statue of Liberty -- "Give me your tired, your poor,
your huddled masses yearning to breathe free"--and prayed over
whether to go ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "We discussed it," Morris said, "and me and the Lord just felt
like it was the right thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   The show opened last month.</TE>
<TE>   Hasan looks at the work that she and her husband have rendered in
acrylics and oils. She selects a painting that, amid words from the
Koran, depicts a door.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like hope," she said. "All the time, everybody wants
something good behind the locked door. It is the hope. Something good
from God."</TE>

<HD>Trial Pits Earth First! Against U.S., Oakland</HD>
<DH>Court: Suit by activists, one of whom has died, claims 1990
bombing arrest was a frame-up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTINA BOXALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>More than a decade after Judi Bari accused FBI agents and local
police of framing her in a car bombing--and five years after she died
of breast cancer--the fiddle-playing, in-your-face Earth First!
activist is getting her day in court.</LD>
<LD>   Bari's civil rights lawsuit against federal agents and the Oakland
Police Department is in mid-trial here, another in the periodic bouts
between Northern California's radical community and the
establishment.</LD>
<LD>   At the plaintiffs' table, attorneys are bearded and pony-tailed.
One left court with his papers stuffed into a Victoria's Secret
shopping bag. Another sniffed a small wildflower during his
colleague's aggressive questioning of a retired FBI agent.</LD>
<TE>   The haircuts are shorter and briefcases conventional at the other
counsel table, where straight-faced lawyers for the U.S. Department
of Justice and the city of Oakland defend their clients' handling of
the bombing case.</TE>
<TE>   The federal suit was filed by Bari and fellow Earth First!
activist Darryl Cherney a year after a pipe bomb ripped through
Bari's cluttered Subaru as the two drove down an Oakland street.
Cherney sustained minor injuries. Bari was hospitalized for weeks
with pelvic, colon and nerve damage from which she never fully
recovered.</TE>
<TE>   Within a day of the May 1990 explosion, while Bari was in
intensive care, Oakland police arrested the pair on charges of
possessing and transporting an explosive device.</TE>
<TE>   Alameda County prosecutors later said they did not have sufficient
evidence to pursue the case, and charges were never filed. No other
arrests were ever made.</TE>
<TE>   Cherney and Bari believed someone had tried to kill them. It was a
volatile time on the North Coast as environmentalists and the timber
industry clashed over the logging of old-growth forests. There were
rallies, logging-truck blockades and tree-sits. Bari was at the
forefront.</TE>
<TE>   She had received death threats: a drawing of a noose, a photo with
the crosshairs of a rifle's telescopic sight imposed on her face. The
year before, a logging truck had rammed the car she was riding in.</TE>
<TE>   But, she claimed, authorities didn't care, instead pointing the
finger at her and Cherney when the nail-wrapped pipe bomb exploded
inches from her. Years later she would say the government had not
only accused them of being violent terrorists but also of "stupid,
violent terrorists" who blew themselves up.</TE>
<TE>   The note-scribbling jury of nine women and three men in U.S.
District Court are in essence being asked to decide now whether
authorities had good reason to suspect that Bari and Cherney were
carrying a bomb that accidentally blew up, or whether law enforcement
used the bombing to go after an annoying bunch of radical
environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   During its slow trip to trial, the federal civil rights lawsuit
was considerably narrowed by rulings that barred efforts to portray
the Bari-Cherney arrests as part of a much broader, historic FBI
campaign to repress radical political dissent. Bari's camp is
nonetheless doing its best to make a forum of the trial.</TE>
<TE>   "This lawsuit became the vehicle to talk about these FBI programs
that do tremendous damage to the progressive community." said Karen
Pickett, a Bari friend and long-time Earth First! organizer. "It is
an attempt to hold these people accountable for their actions."</TE>
<TE>   Pickett is among a faithful following of Bari-Cherney supporters
and Bay Area lefties who are filling courtroom benches during the
seven-week trial before Judge Claudia Wilken.</TE>
<TE>   They are listening to a sometimes tedious, occasionally funny or
angry recounting of how authorities conducted the bombing
investigation, what they said and what they concluded. Among the key
plaintiffs' assertions is that law enforcement lied about the bomb's
placement in the car and about whether nails wrapped around the pipe
bomb matched those that Bari, a carpenter, had in her car or home.</TE>
<TE>   An expert witness for the plaintiffs' side testified that damage
to Bari's 1981 Subaru clearly showed that the bomb was under the
driver's seat--suggesting that it had been hidden there by someone
other than the occupants.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Joseph Sher, Department of Justice senior trial
counsel and the lead defense lawyer, said the plaintiffs' court
presentation so far "indicates their argument is that because FBI
agents in other places were investigating the criminal conduct of
people associated with Earth First! ... that demonstrates these
defendants were out to get Earth First! That's nonsense."</TE>
<TE>   Concerning the bomb placement, he said that "every trained bomb
investigator at the scene ... agreed it was reasonable to conclude
these people were carrying the bomb based on what they saw at the
scene."</TE>
<TE>   And though authorities were unable to prove their early statement
that nails taken from Bari's home matched those in the bomb, Sher
said that was because the manufacturing batch was too large to
ascertain a sure match.</TE>
<TE>   The defense, which will start to present its case next week when
the plaintiffs finish theirs, expects to put about 10 witnesses on
the stand. Called by plaintiffs earlier in the trial, one defendant
said he and other investigators had acted in good faith.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a lot of information about them," retired Oakland Police
Sgt. Michael Sitterud said. "It looked like a good case to me. It
looked like it was their bomb."</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1980 in Arizona, Earth First! has operated as a
loose-knit network of environmental activists who avoid membership
rolls and traditional leadership and favor attention-getting
tactics--from sitting for weeks in ancient trees threatened by
logging to driving spikes into their trunks to chew up chainsaw
blades.</TE>
<TE>   Cherney says he never spiked trees, and Bari had made a point of
disavowing violence. When the bomb exploded they were on their way to
UC Santa Cruz, where they planned to give a concert and recruit
students for the Redwood Summer of 1990, a series of civil
disobedience actions on the North Coast aimed at stopping the cutting
of centuries-old redwoods.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm talking and all of a sudden I heard a crack and my ears were
ringing," Cherney recalled over a falafel and pita supper at a
Berkeley diner. "My first reaction was that I was dead."</TE>
<TE>   He escaped with ruptured eardrums and cuts. Bari, seriously
injured and screaming in pain, had to be pried from the driver's seat
with machinery.</TE>
<TE>   "Judi and I had big mouths, and were associated with a radical
environmental group and were proud of it," he says by way of
explaining why anyone would target them.</TE>
<TE>   Cherney, who had been Bari's lover (the couple was in the midst of
one of their frequent break-ups at the time of the bombing),
describes her as having the IQ of Einstein and "the voice of a
7-year-old, maybe 8."</TE>
<TE>   Short and funny, she also possessed acute radar for sexist remarks
and the ability to inspire. "She was our regional Martin Luther
King," Cherney said.</TE>
<TE>   Like Bari, he is a songwriter and musician who grew up on the East
Coast. The bushy beard he had at the time of the bombing has been
shaved, his thick, dark hair neatly trimmed. He wears a navy blue
blazer and button-down shirts to court.</TE>
<TE>   But he lives in a one-room geodesic dome in Humboldt County,
writes satirical lyrics and continues to organize for Earth First!,
which though quieter and smaller than it was in the early 1990s,
still runs tree-sits in Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   With attorneys who have either worked cheaply or for nothing, Bari
was heavily involved in the lawsuit until shortly before her 1997
death of breast cancer. She summarized depositions--there are more
than 100--and organized thousands of pages of government documents
obtained in discovery.</TE>
<TE>   She also gave concerts to raise money for the case. And she
laughed about it.</TE>
<TE>   In one song about the FBI, she laments: "They took away my
Birkenstocks/They took away my car/But when they took away my fiddle
they went too far."</TE>

<HD>Search of Landfill Continues for Boy, 2</HD>
<DH>Vanished: Crews expect to finish digging through trash by
Monday.</DH>

<BD>From a Times staff writer</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>In searching for clues about the disappearance of 2-year-old Jahi
Turner, police and other volunteers continued combing through the
city landfill and a canyon near the boy's home Friday without
success.</LD>
<LD>   In a bizarre twist, police raking garbage at the Miramar landfill
found an envelope with the name of Steven Feldman, attorney for David
Westerfield. Westerfield is accused of the February kidnapping and
murder of 7-year-old Danielle van Dam.</LD>
<LD>   Police spokesman David Cohen said the envelope was impounded until
the judge in the case decides where the contents should be sent.</LD>
<TE>   Cohen said police estimated that the search through 5,000 tons of
trash should be completed by Monday night. Police, Marines, sailors
and others have been examining the trash since Tuesday morning.</TE>
<TE>   The landfill is near the home of Jahi's mother and stepfather,
Tameka and Tieray Jones, but police have not said what prompted them
to search it.</TE>
<TE>   Jahi disappeared April 25. His stepfather says that he took the
boy to a park and left him for 15 minutes. The boy was gone when he
returned, he said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A libel lawsuit filed against Erin Brockovich by her ex-husband has
been settled, Brockovich's attorney said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "The parties just decided to get on with their lives and put it
behind them," said David Weeks, an attorney for Erin Brockovich.</LD>
<LD>   Reno stockbroker Steven Michael Brockovich filed the lawsuit in
March 2001, alleging that the legal assistant immortalized in a
Hollywood film falsely claimed in two publications that he failed to
pay child support for their daughter. He said the articles hurt his
reputation in Reno, causing his business to drop.</LD>
<TE>   Weeks declined to provide any details of the settlement, saying
the terms are confidential. An attorney for Steven Brockovich
declined to comment.</TE>

<LD>Police Chief Bernard C. Parks' retirement will become effective

<LD>   Parks, who has been on vacation for several days, signed an
official notice of his retirement that was sent to the Police

<LD>   Deputy Chief Michael Bostic has been serving as acting chief.
Parks announced last month that he would drop his efforts to win
reappointment, having failed to garner the support of either the
commission or the City Council. The Police Commission is expected to
choose an interim chief Tuesday from a field of six candidates.</LD>

questioned and his home was searched, but no explosives were found
there.</LD>

it was not determined what was inside the device.</LD>

<LD>A Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy was convicted by a Los Angeles
Superior Court jury on Friday of using stolen credit cards to
purchase nearly $9,000 in custom car wheels and rims.</LD>
<LD>   David Osorio, 30, who has been suspended without pay pending
resolution of the case, was found guilty on two counts of grand theft
and unauthorized use of an access card, said Sandi Gibbons,
spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney's office</LD>
<LD>   In March 1999, Osorio charged $8,900 worth of auto accessories at
a Bellflower automotive firm using an unauthorized credit card,
prosecutors said. During the trial, two store employees identified
Osorio as the customer, Gibbons said.</LD>
<TE>   Osorio has until Wednesday to post $50,000 bail or he must
surrender until his sentencing May 31. He has been free on his own
recognizance, but now faces a state prison term or probation.</TE>

created a chronic staffing shortage that has led to improper care for
patients, union officials said. They charged the hospital with unfair
labor practices, including retaliation against workers who have
protested the staffing levels.</LD>
<LD>   More than 90% of employees voted to go forward with the strike if
no resolution is reached.</LD>

<HD>As California Budget Goes, So Go School Districts'</HD>
<DH>Education: L.A.'s woes stem from state funding mechanism,
experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOUG SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Teachers are calling the painful cuts made by the Los Angeles Board
of Education last week the Tuesday Night Massacre. To many, they are
a tragic replay of a budget meltdown that scalded the schools 10
years ago.</LD>
<LD>   During that crisis, the board leaned on teachers to make up the
deficit by taking a 10% pay cut. Now, having fought for a decade to
restore their pay and then add a few percentage points, the teachers
view increased class sizes and reduced health benefits as merely a
more devious way of saving money, and they are in a finger-pointing
mood. They blame the district's old bugaboos of bureaucracy,
inefficiency and heedless spending for the estimated $400-million gap
in the proposed $5.2-billion general fund budget.</LD>
<LD>   No one, including officials in charge of the 735,000-student
district, would deny that many of its troubles are self-inflicted.
But school finance experts around the state insist that the root of
the problem is a state funding mechanism that causes school dollars
to yo-yo with the state budget and the overall economy.</LD>
<TE>   "What L.A. is facing is a microcosm of what all districts are or
will be facing as we go through this budget process," said Brett
McFadden, finance specialist with the Assn. of California School
Administrators in Sacramento. "I don't think the average voter
realizes that in a week and a half we'll have final data that will
indicate we're going to have the worst state budget crisis in ...
history."</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of other large and mid-sized districts are already making
similar cuts, including teacher layoffs and class-size increases.
Budget deficits being reported around the state include $3 million by
Burbank Unified School District, $5.4 million by Berkeley Unified, $8
million by Monterey Peninsula Unified, $10 million by Moreno Valley
Unified and $56 million by Tustin Unified, according to reports
gathered by the state's Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team.</TE>
<TE>   Although the amounts are much larger in Los Angeles because of its
size and demographic makeup, some other districts are proposing
cutbacks that are arguably more severe. At least five, for example,
are considering raising the 20-student class size in kindergarten
through third grade, a state reform initiated during the boom of the
1990s. Los Angeles' class sizes may increase, but only in the older
grades, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   The forces buffeting school budgets are a result of the normal
economic swings that affect all tax-supported agencies. But they are
compounded by the state's enormously complex education funding scheme
as well as a few cost factors that are unique to schools.</TE>
<TE>   Schools take up the largest share of the state budget--roughly
40%--and therefore cannot be easily held immune from the cycle of
recession and boom.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have good times, spending on schools soars," said
Stephen Carroll, senior economist at the Rand Corp. think tank. "But
the same budget can't soar all the time."</TE>
<TE>   From the perspective of Los Angeles' superintendent, the former
governor of Colorado, it's easier to administer a state budget than
L.A. Unified's.</TE>
<TE>   "The finance is very much more perplexing here," Roy Romer said.
"At the state level, I had more flexibility to find cures."</TE>
<TE>   School districts have expenses they can't always control, said
Scott Plotkin, executive director of the California School Boards
Assn. and a former consultant to the state Senate Education
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The major one is teacher salaries, which come with less obvious
costs such as built-in increases for seniority and educational
advancement.</TE>
<TE>   "Just about every school district in the state has its salary
schedule on automatic pilot," Plotkin said.</TE>
<TE>   Those increases eat into a district's state funding, which rises
according to the cost-of-living index. In recent years, average staff
increases have been in the 8% to 10% range, McFadden said. "When you
get in a budget deficit, you have to look to lay off people--school
counselors, psychologists and other specialized staff that assist
kids in need."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, some say the biggest beneficiaries of the district's
spending over the years have been teachers. Their salaries comprise
more than half of this year's budget.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles Unified last year, three dissenting board members
protested as irresponsible a new teacher contract that cost the
district more than a 15% average increase in salary, benefits and
bonuses.</TE>
<TE>   But school district officials said the boost was needed to keep
teachers' pay competitive with other districts' and to avert a
threatened strike.</TE>
<TE>   For their part, teachers say the district should be cutting
consultants, lawyers and administrators rather than teachers or
school costs.</TE>
<TE>   "The district has gotten itself into a mess because they have done
nothing since 1992 when they had to cut teachers' pay to restructure
the budget so that the classroom is the priority," said United
Teachers Los Angeles President-elect John Perez said.</TE>
<TE>   The pressures on school district budgets, however, stem from more
than staff salaries, Plotkin said. They face double-digit increases
in health-care costs and utilities, he said. Workers' compensation
claims are also climbing nationally, as are unfunded federal mandates
for special education.</TE>
<TE>   This year, L.A. Unified budgeted $50 million more for special
education, but because of mandated increases in services, had to
spend $65 million, said chief financial officer Joe Zeronian.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Unified is particularly hard pressed. As it begins to open
new schools to relieve pervasive overcrowding, its operating costs
will rise even more.</TE>
<TE>   The state's method of dealing with these forces has changed
radically in the last 30 years, from nearly total reliance on local
property taxes to a complex funding model designed to assure schools
a minimum share of the state's budget.</TE>
<TE>   The property tax system provided stable income but was grossly
inequitable because communities with higher property values could
easily pay for better schools.</TE>
<TE>   A 1970s court decision forced the state to devise an equitable
school funding system.</TE>
<TE>   That system takes the property tax base from each district and
adds to that a portion of state general funds that has gradually been
adjusted over the years to reduce differences in per-student spending
across the state.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 13, the 1978 initiative that slowed property tax
growth, has increased the reliance on general state tax revenues,
thus also increasing the vulnerability of school funding to economic
swings.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll of Rand thinks the euphoric spending during booms needs to
be curtailed and the excess money put in reserve for the bleak
periods that are sure to follow.</TE>
<TE>   "Then, when the state budget tanks, even it out with the reserve
fund," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Zeronian sees limits to how well that would work. The district
built up a $600-million reserve, he said, but it wasn't enough to
stave off cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "You dip into your reserve and have an unbalanced budget for a
year or two and that keeps your programs going, but you can't
continue doing that. Eventually, at some point, you have to restrict
programs or you can't survive."</TE>
<TE>   More radical thinkers are calling for an entirely new model based
not on the amount of money in the state pot from year to year, but on
the calculated cost of providing the required number of classrooms,
schools, counselors and other resources. The drawback is that it
would require the state to come up with new taxes in an economic
downturn to keep school districts whole.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of full school funding see the boom-bust cycle in a
different light. During the best years, they say, school districts
spend every available dollar to catch up for years of neglect. During
hard times, they slip back again.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is that since Proposition 13, there has never
been a good year for education in California," said L.A. board
President Caprice Young.</TE>
<TE>   "You can argue over statistics of whether we are at or near the
bottom. The fact is none of us who care about our kids want to be
anywhere but near the top. We're nowhere close."</TE>

<CX>   Tustin Unified-A story in the California section Saturday about
school finance mischaracterized a $56-million budget cut in the Tustin
Unified School District as deficit reduction. The district postponed two
school construction projects because of a delay in receiving state bond
money, not a shortage of operating funds.</CX>

<HD>4 Hearings Set on Burbank Airport Noise Study</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority will hold four public
hearings next week to update local residents on the status of a
federal study calling for an overnight noise curfew at the east San
Fernando Valley airport, officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The three-year, $4-million study will examine a proposed 10 p.m.
to 7 a.m. curfew at Burbank Airport. The issue is central to the
question of whether the airport authority should build a new
terminal.</LD>
<LD>   A final version of the review will be presented to the Federal
Aviation Administration for approval sometime during the next year,
said Burbank Airport spokesman Victor Gill.</LD>
<TE>   The public sessions begin at 7 p.m. and will be held Monday at the
Burbank Airport Hilton, Tuesday at Beverly Garland's Holiday Inn in
North Hollywood, Wednesday at Roscoe Elementary School in Sun Valley
and Thursday at the Glendale Hilton.</TE>
<TE>   Airport officials said they had been sidetracked from the study by
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, which forced changes in security.
Because of those changes, airport officials have suspended plans for
a new terminal.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, the [security] measures are going to have a profound
impact on the airport in the coming months," Gill said. "The
authority will have to confront numerous issues concerning the
current terminal's ability to accommodate the new security
requirements.''</TE>
<TE>   Representatives from the aviation consulting firms of
Landrum&amp;Brown and SH&amp;E will update the public on the noise study,
which was launched in July 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Besides public testimony, the study will include a cost-benefit
analysis of noise reduction, as well as information from the airlines
and local businesses.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, Congress passed the Airport Noise and Control Act to stop
the proliferation of noise rules at commercial airports, which was
creating a patchwork of conflicting regulations for airlines.</TE>
<TE>   A portion of that act, now contained in Part 161 of federal
aviation regulations, empowered airports to conduct studies that
could lead to special FAA-approved noise rules for individual
airports.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, about a dozen airports have considered or started
so-called Part 161 studies. The FAA has not approved any curfews
since the noise act was passed.</TE>
<TE>   Burbank Airport, which serves about 4.7 million passengers a year,
has been trying to build a terminal to better meet passenger demand
and to relocate the existing 1930s-era facility, which federal
officials say is too close to the runway.</TE>
<TE>   After a protracted legal and political fight, city and airport
negotiators signed a terminal framework agreement in August 1999. But
that agreement broke down amid opposition from the FAA, the airlines
and area residents.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Burbank voters approved a measure that seeks to reduce
jet noise, air pollution and traffic congestion by imposing an
overnight curfew and capping the number of flights. Shortly after,
the city of Burbank filed a lawsuit against the airport authority.</TE>

<HD>As a Word, 'Church' Isn't Up to City Code</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Thousand Oaks City Council is preparing to strike the word
"church" from its lexicon.</LD>
<LD>   Broader terms--"religious facilities" and "religious
organizations"--would replace the word throughout the city's
municipal code under the measure council members are expected to
approve formally this month.</LD>
<LD>   Practically speaking the change has no effect. Already, any
ordinance that pertains to Christian houses of worship--from tax
exemptions to zoning to food preparation standards--applies equally
to other places of worship.</LD>
<TE>   Symbolically, though, backers say it could mean a great deal to
the thousands of Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs and others
settling in the affluent suburb in eastern Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   "Church" implies Christianity, and government code shouldn't
reflect a religious bias, they said.</TE>
<TE>   They hope the change will serve as an example to other California
cities. Although some cities already use broader terms, many of them
have retained the word "church." San Francisco code refers to "a
church or other religious institution," and San Jose code refers to a
"a church or religious assembly."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles code uses "church" as a generic term, said a spokesman
for the city attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "The rest of the world is divided on religious and ethnic and
color lines," said Nick Quidwai, a Pakistani American Muslim who
lives in Thousand Oaks and proposed the change to city planning
commissioners last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at what's happening in India and Bethlehem and the
Philippines and Afghanistan," Quidwai said. "Here, we pride ourselves
on our diversity. Our community has grown. This is another thing that
will make us united."</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks was mostly white and Christian when it was
incorporated in 1964. Of the 36,768 people who lived in the city in
1970, census figures show 98% were white. There were 121 blacks, 283
Asians and no Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   Three decades later, whites make up slightly more than
three-fourths of the city's 117,000 residents; more than 15,000 are
Latino, 7,000 are Asian and 1,200 are black.</TE>
<TE>   While no religious census of the city exists, churches still
greatly outnumber other houses of worship. But a handful of
synagogues, mosques and temples share the stage.</TE>
<TE>   Their growing membership has been fueled by urban flight from Los
Angeles, second-generation families and the expansion of local
science and technology firms, including biotech giant Amgen, which
have attracted foreign-born scientists and engineers.</TE>
<TE>   "I happen to be Roman Catholic, so I go to a church," said
Councilman Andy Fox. "But people of other religions don't go to a
church, and it seems appropriate that, in government, our language be
inclusive."</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,500 Jewish families attend the city's two synagogues
and hundreds drive to a synagogue in neighboring Agoura Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The Islamic Center of Conejo Valley, whose membership includes 300
families, is expanding its Thousand Oaks facility. Jehovah's
Witnesses have a Kingdom Hall in town; and the city's 100-member
Bahai spiritual assembly has bought land for a center.</TE>
<TE>   Quidwai, 50, a salesman, has lived in the community since 1979. He
didn't notice the word "church" in the city code until five years
ago, when he helped the Islamic Center seek zoning changes to land it
had purchased for its mosque and school. "I noticed the permits made
several references to churches, which didn't make any sense because
we weren't a church," he said. Years passed before Quidwai decided to
make it an issue.</TE>
<TE>   He presented his case after a couple of religious facilities
brought requests before the city Planning Commission. Planning
commissioners were receptive and forwarded a recommendation to the
City Council.</TE>
<TE>   Temple Etz Chaim administrator Joan Sandoval said the language in
the city code books carries over into conversations. "When I'm
dealing with the people in the city, they often use the word 'church'
as a generic term for a religious institution, but it's not a generic
term," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's very refreshing and supportive that they're making
this change."</TE>

<HD>Irvine Hits Coad's Park Plan Deadline</HD>
<DH>Land use: City delivers blueprint to fund North County
improvements to keep her vote on El Toro. She's reviewing it.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Irvine officials met a Friday deadline for telling Orange County
Supervisor Cynthia P. Coad how they propose to find money for North
County parks from the development of the former El Toro Marine base,
but no details of their plan were released.</LD>
<LD>   Coad said she wanted to review the plan before making it public.
Irvine officials didn't return calls seeking comment Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "I have to have some experts review it and make sure we can all
come out winners," Coad said.</LD>
<TE>   Coad cast the swing vote last month for Irvine's bid before the
Board of Supervisors to annex most of the 4,700-acre base. She said
her vote was predicated on assurances that North County would get
yearly funding from property taxes paid on the development of the
base, plus a one-time allotment of about $2 million for parks in her
district.</TE>
<TE>   When it became clear that Irvine's plan to use El Toro property
taxes for North County parks wasn't feasible under state law, Coad
asked for an alternative plan by Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine's new plan proposes "a combination of things," she said, to
yield the money she wants--about $800,000 a year. But if she isn't
satisfied, she said, she'll put Irvine's annexation bid on the May 14
Board of Supervisors agenda and change her vote. She joined
Supervisors Todd Spitzer and Tom Wilson in voting April 16 for the
annexation. Supervisors Jim Silva and Chuck Smith voted against it.</TE>
<TE>   "There seems to be an honest attempt to make North County
residents feel that they, too, are being served by [development of]
El Toro," said Coad, who lives in unincorporated West Anaheim, where
there is one acre of parkland per 100,000 residents.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine officials intend to create a redevelopment agency at the
base to pay for improvements, which under state law means most of El
Toro's property taxes must be spent there.</TE>
<TE>   The base generates no taxes now because it is federal property.
The Navy announced last month that it will sell most of the land.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine's redevelopment plan is based on zoning approved by county
voters March 5 when they killed the county's plans to build an
airport at El Toro. If the city annexes the property, it won't be
bound by the zoning; city planners already have proposed 1,500 homes
in a southern slice of the base.</TE>
<TE>   Creating guaranteed revenue for North County isn't the only
annexation hurdle Irvine faces. The city must complete an
environmental and financial review justifying the annexation and
submit plans to the Orange County Local Agency Formation Commission,
a state-created agency that oversees incorporations and annexations.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor-elect Chris Norby, who will replace Coad in January,
said he supports her demand for park money.</TE>

<HD>Police Crack Down on Cruising</HD>
<DH>Safety: Authorities target Sunset Boulevard, saying that
gang violence has increased.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Concerned that gun-waving and beer-hurling by gangs might soon
degenerate into bloodshed along busy Sunset Boulevard, nearly 60 law
enforcement officers fanned out Friday night in search of cruisers
looking for trouble.</LD>
<LD>   Officers from the California Highway Patrol and Los Angeles Police
Department, some working undercover, joined the crackdown in
Hollywood and West Hollywood along the glitzy but rough boulevard,
where prostitution, drunkenness and traffic congestion have long been
problems. Recently, however, gang activity has added to the danger,
said LAPD Capt. Patrick Findley.</LD>
<LD>   ''In the last month or so, we've seen a couple of shootings. My
gang people watch it, and can see it's escalating,'' Findley said.
''It's like a powder keg, and somebody is standing right there with a
match.''</LD>
<TE>   The situation, particularly between Highland Avenue and Doheny
Drive, degenerates into the early morning, he said.</TE>
<TE>   ''By 2 a.m., it really gets bad. People have a real fear of being
attacked. Gang members want to fight each other. They're hanging out
of their cars yelling and throwing their gang signs,'' Findley said.
''What's really concerned us is not only the amount of cruisers, but
that the violence associated with it has increased.''</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, officers said, there was a killing in a gas station
parking lot at Sunset and Crescent Heights boulevards.</TE>
<TE>   Officers on Friday night were watching for speeding, stolen cars
and expired registrations. But they also were watching for people
leaning from their cars, making gang signs or throwing beer bottles.</TE>
<TE>   Police can't stop people for simply looking or acting like gang
members, officials said, but they can try to ensure they don't hurt
someone.</TE>
<TE>   ''If we stop someone because they're wearing baggy pants or they
look like gang members, someone is going to question it and say we're
just harassing them,'' Findley said. ''You can see the argument from
both sides, but what are you going to do? You just follow the law as
it's imposed on us and go after violations.''</TE>
<TE>   Police, Sgt. Steve Richards said, are "going to make it so you
better be squeaky clean with your vehicle and behavior if you want to
be on Sunset."</TE>
<TE>   Complaints from business owners and residents have been numerous,
said Leron Gubler, president and chief executive of the Hollywood
Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   About six years ago, a similar cruising task force helped
alleviate traffic and decreased crime along Hollywood Boulevard,
Findley and Gubler said.</TE>
<TE>   ''It was extremely effective,'' Gubler said. ''It was so bad then
we [had] shut down the boulevard around 11 p.m. It created gridlock
throughout the greater Hollywood area, and the businesses weren't
happy about it.''</TE>
<TE>   This time, said LAPD Cmdr. David Kalish, the crackdown will
continue for "as long as necessary."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Tartan, 70, a retired filmmaker and actor, lives three houses
from Sunset Boulevard near West Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   He said he has become almost inured to the sensory bombardment on
weekends.</TE>
<TE>   ''In New Orleans, people walk around drunk. Here they drive around
Sunset Boulevard,'' Tartan said. ''Hopefully, this task force
discourages people, whether they're gang members or not, by telling
them: 'If you're going to come up here on this street and go vroom,
vroom, vroom and screaming at other people, it's going to be an
expensive trip.'''</TE>

<HD>Mohamed Egal, 73; Led Breakaway Republic of Somaliland</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mohamed Ibrahim Egal, the president of the breakaway Republic of
Somaliland, died Friday from complications during a medical procedure
at a South African military hospital, Somaliland officials said. He
was 73.</LD>
<LD>   A statement from officials who accompanied Egal to One Military
Hospital in Pretoria, South Africa, for treatment said the cause of
death was a laceration during a colonoscopy, a procedure for
examining the colon and rectum. Egal entered the hospital on April 23
for treatment of an undisclosed ailment.</LD>
<LD>   Egal was active in the movement for independence of
British-administered Somaliland. Independence came in June 1960, four
days before the Italian colony of Somalia to the south gained its
independence. The two united the next month to form the Republic of
Somalia.</LD>
<TE>   He served as prime minister of Somalia from July 1967 until
October 1969, when Maj. Gen. Mohamed Siad Barre overthrew the
government and imprisoned Egal and several others.</TE>
<TE>   Egal spent 12 years in prison under Siad Barre. After his release,
Egal took up opposition to the military regime. Siad Barre's air
force bombed Hargeisa, the capital of Somaliland, in 1988 at the
beginning of a general upheaval against his government.</TE>
<TE>   When clan-based political factions ousted Siad Barre in January
1991, Egal and others in the Somali National Movement set up a
government for a separate Somaliland in the northwestern corner of
Somalia, an impoverished, largely lawless Muslim country on the Horn
of Africa. But members disagreed over whether to declare outright
independence.</TE>
<TE>   Clan elders and a constituent assembly elected Egal the second
president of the Somaliland republic in May 1993 as the rest of
Somalia descended into chaos while clan-based warlords fought one
another for control. But Egal was never able to gain international
recognition for the republic, a fact he blamed on the insistence by
the international community that Somalia, although without a central
government, should remain a unified nation.</TE>
<TE>   Egal was reelected in 1997, and his final term was to have expired
this year. But presidential elections were postponed until next
February.</TE>
<TE>   "Egal's personality was stamped on Somaliland, but Somaliland was
there before Egal, and I think it's safe to assume that it will
remain after him," said Matt Bryden, the coordinator of the War-torn
Societies Project in Somalia, a U.N.-funded organization that helps
countries rebuild political institutions after wars.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason for this is that Egal's was an administration and not
a faction.... Somaliland is in the process of establishing
institutions of government that are young and weak, but they are not
dependent on a single personality," Bryden said in a telephone
interview, adding that he expected Somaliland's neighbors--Ethiopia
and Djibouti--to "attempt to influence the process."</TE>
<TE>   Egal refused to throw his lot in with a transitional national
government for Somalia that was chosen by clan representatives in
August 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Under the constitution, Vice President Dahir Riyale Kahin became
acting president in Hargeisa, where he met with the cabinet Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Egal is survived by his wife, Khultun Haji Dahir, and five
children.</TE>

<HD>Suspended Forest Service Worker Sues to Block Off-Roaders</HD>
<DH>Outdoors: Patrolman removed signs allowing vehicles in
portions of Angeles National Forest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 23-year employee of the U.S. Forest Service has sued the agency and
two supervisors, asking a judge to compel the Forest Service to keep
off-highway vehicles out of portions of Angeles National Forest.</LD>
<LD>   The cause of the dispute--and the patrolman's suspension by his
superiors--was a series of road signs posted along a remote road
known as 3N17.</LD>
<LD>   The patrolman, Robert Libershal, said that after seeing the signs
allowing off-highway vehicles such as ATVs to travel on 17 miles of
3N17, he spoke with co-workers, studied the forest plan and concluded
that the road was not open to such vehicles. So he took the signs
down.</LD>
<TE>   Forest supervisors countered that Libershal was misinterpreting
forest regulations and ordered him to replace the signs. After he
refused, they suspended him for three days last week without pay.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the lawsuit, Libershal is asking the judge to overturn
the suspension. "I chose to correct a wrong," he said of his actions.
"I was doing what I know to be right according to the regulations for
the forest plan and the laws."</TE>
<TE>   In the suit, filed Monday in U.S. District Court on behalf of
Libershal and the organization Forest Service Employees for
Environmental Ethics, attorneys for the plaintiffs asked a judge to
declare that the directive issued by Libershal's superiors, ordering
him to reinstate the signs, violated the National Forest Management
Act.</TE>
<TE>   Named in the suit are the Forest Service, Forest Supervisor Jody
Cook and District Ranger Don Cosby.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Stahl, executive director of Forest Service Employees for
Environmental Ethics, a nonprofit group based in Oregon, said he
believes this is the first time a Forest Service employee has sued to
enforce the basic blueprint that the Forest Service must follow in
managing the forest for all uses, including recreation, wildlife and
water.</TE>
<TE>   The Forest Service is revising the forest plans for the Angeles,
Cleveland, Los Padres and San Bernardino national forests.</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of the suit is the larger question of what portions
of Angeles National Forest are open to off-highway vehicles, labeled
OHVs in forest parlance.</TE>
<TE>   The 1989 forest plan labels the 17-mile stretch of 3N17 between
the Mill Creek and North Fork ranger stations as closed to OHV
traffic. The road is roughly 20 miles north of La Canada Flintridge.</TE>
<TE>   "The forest plan is very clear," said Patrick Parenteau, one of
the plaintiffs' attorneys. "It says only those routes on the attached
map that are designated open are, in essence, open."</TE>
<TE>   Forest officials, meanwhile, maintain that the signs Libershal
took down had been appropriately placed.</TE>
<TE>   Cook said that because the road had been designated an interim
route on the state's Back Country Discovery Trails program--a series
of interconnected routes that allow off-highway vehicle travel from
Oregon to the Mexican border--it was open to all kinds of off-highway
vehicles. A June 2000 forest map shows the road as a designated
off-highway vehicle route.</TE>
<TE>   But Libershal disagrees with that assessment, saying that map was
put out in error.</TE>
<TE>   He pointed to a March 1997 letter to state parks and recreation
officials by then-District Ranger Clara Johnson, asking for roads
within Angeles National Forest to be designated back-country
discovery trails. Referring to the western end of 3N17, Johnson wrote
that "the route is unpaved and over 50 inches wide, but is not
currently an OHV route."</TE>
<TE>   "No one I work with is aware of any change," Libershal said. "I
would think that a legal order would have to change the land
management plan, with a review period and public comment. It wouldn't
just be someone in an office making a decision. For those 17 miles,
it's not an OHV route."</TE>
<TE>   Cook said she was aware that a lawsuit had been filed, but had not
yet received an official copy. Citing pending litigation, she said
she was not at liberty to comment.</TE>

<HD>Gallegly Defends Jet Program Despite Crash</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV and TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After meeting with the command staff at Point Mugu, Rep. Elton
Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) said Friday he has no reason to believe that
a fatal jet crash at the base's annual air show last month is linked
to the aircraft's troubled maintenance division.</LD>
<LD>   "To a person, they said if they ever had a question about the
flyability of these airplanes they would have been grounded,"
Gallegly said after an hourlong meeting with three top base officials
in which they discussed staffing and management of the QF-4 jet
squadron.</LD>
<LD>   "I have a tremendously high level of confidence in their
leadership," Gallegly said. "The tougher questions I ask, the more
confidence I have."</LD>
<TE>   During the briefing, the officers told Gallegly that a regularly
scheduled audit of the maintenance program, conducted by the Naval
Safety Center after the accident, showed the program in compliance
with a checklist of procedures, he said. The audit began before the
April 20 air show crash.</TE>
<TE>   Navy Lt. Cmdr. Michael Norman, 39, of Camarillo and Marine Capt.
Andrew Muhs, 31, were killed when their jet slammed into a marshy
field in front of 25,000 spectators. The cause of the accident has
not been determined.</TE>
<TE>   Gallegly said he was aware of some worker complaints within the
QF-4 squadron, which have been driven mostly by staff reductions and
gripes with supervisors. But he said he doesn't believe these
problems have affected the safety of the squadron's flight crew.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on the safety net I see, I don't believe the safety has
been compromised at this installation as a result of that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   They did not discuss the Navy's independent investigation into the
air show crash. Rather, their meeting focused on the overall
operations of the QF-4 jet program, Gallegly said. Navy officials
declined to comment. Meanwhile, Navy officials have made a public
appeal to spectators who may have photographed or videotaped the jet
crash to assist in the investigation.</TE>

Affairs Office. Code 75000E/575 I Street, Suite 1, Point Mugu, CA

Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) said Friday he has no reason to
believe that a fatal jet crash at the base's annual air show last
month is linked to the aircraft's troubled maintenance division.</LD>
<LD>   "To a person, they said if they ever had a question about the
flyability of these airplanes they would have been grounded,"
Gallegly said after an hourlong meeting with three top base officials
in which they discussed staffing and management of the QF-4 jet
squadron.</LD>
<LD>   "I have a tremendously high level of confidence in their
leadership," Gallegly said. "The tougher questions I ask, the more
confidence I have."</LD>
<TE>   During the briefing, the officers told Gallegly that a regularly
scheduled audit of the maintenance program, conducted by the Naval
Safety Center after the accident, showed the program in compliance
with a checklist of procedures, he said. The audit began before the
April 20 air show crash.</TE>
<TE>   Navy Lt. Cmdr. Michael Norman, 39, of Camarillo and Marine Capt.
Andrew Muhs, 31, were killed when their jet slammed into a marshy
field in front of 25,000 spectators. The cause of the accident has
not been determined.</TE>
<TE>   Gallegly said he was aware of some worker complaints within the
QF-4 squadron, which have been driven mostly by staff reductions and
gripes with supervisors. But he said he doesn't believe these
problems have affected the safety of the squadron's flight crew.</TE>
<TE>   "Do I feel there's evidence to convince me that as a result of
reductions in personnel that has compromised or will compromise the
safety of the aircraft?" he said. "Based on the safety net I see, I
don't believe the safety has been compromised at this installation as
a result of that."</TE>
<TE>   Gallegly said he met with Capt. Mark Swaney, vice commander of the
Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division; Capt. Mike Rabens,
commander of Naval Test Wing Pacific; and Capt. Dave Madsen,
commander of Naval Weapons Test Squadron Point Mugu.</TE>
<TE>   They did not discuss the Navy's independent investigation into the
air show crash. Rather, their meeting focused on the overall
operations of the QF-4 jet program, Gallegly said. Navy officials
declined to comment about the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The congressman's meeting came on the same day that the results of
a monthlong survey of 20 maintenance workers at the base were turned
over to Navy officials. The survey was prompted by recent reviews of
the QF-4 squadron's maintenance division.</TE>
<TE>   The maintenance reviews "identified a significant number of
performance deficiencies and safety discrepancies," a memo attached
to the survey stated. "Because of this, the command is now faced with
the difficult decision of determining whether the QF-4 maintenance
group is capable of achieving the standards of performance for
flight, aircraft availability and productivity that must be met to
ensure its continued existence."</TE>
<TE>   The 23-question survey was distributed to flight crews in the days
leading up to the air show crash. Questions covered everything from
management and worker training to overall safety of the program.</TE>
<TE>   "What are some of the things that are preventing the QF-4
maintenance team from performing as well as it might?" was one
question posed to employees in the survey, a copy of which was
obtained by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   After employees filled out the questionnaire, Navy officials
conducted follow-up interviews with them.</TE>
<TE>   Dissension and morale problems continue to hamper the QF-4's
maintenance division, according to some workers who participated in
the survey. The biggest complaint centers on poor management, said
the workers, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Union officials who represent 120 civilian employees at the
Ventura County Navy base said such a response shows that much remains
to be done to correct problems within the squadron.</TE>
<TE>   John Hunter, local representative of the National Assn. of
Government Employees, said civilian supervisors who took over the
program last year were destined to have problems because they had
little experience with the decades-old QF-4 mechanical systems. He
noted that a 1999 federally mandated staff reduction program forced
out or transferred experienced mechanics and eroded the morale of
those who remained.</TE>
<TE>   "There is inexperience and a lack of respect for subordinates,"
Hunter said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Navy officials have made a public appeal to spectators
at the air show who may have photographed or videotaped the jet crash
for copies of their film to assist in the investigation.</TE>

<HD>W. F. Gibson, 69; Ousted as Head of the NAACP</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. William F. Gibson, a civil rights leader whose tenure as chairman
of the NAACP was marred by allegations that he spent the
organization's money lavishly and diverted some funds for his own
use, has died. He was 69.</LD>
<LD>   Gibson died Thursday in Greenville, S.C., where he lived. The
cause of death was not announced.</LD>
<LD>   Gibson, a dentist, headed South Carolina's NAACP chapter for 18
years before being elected chairman of the national board in 1985.</LD>
<TE>   "He had a passion for social justice," the Rev. Jesse Jackson
said. "No one in our state registered more voters and raised more
issues of social justice than Dr. Gibson."</TE>
<TE>   Gibson's term as chairman of the National Assn. for the
Advancement of Colored People ended in 1995, the year he was accused
of contributing to the group's $3-million-plus deficit by abusing his
expense account.</TE>
<TE>   He was ousted by one vote and replaced by Myrlie Evers-Williams,
the widow of Medgar Evers, a former NAACP official who was murdered
in Mississippi in 1963.</TE>
<TE>   Although Gibson said he could account for nearly all the $111,930
in question as NAACP business, his 10-year tenure was also hampered
by complaints about a decline in corporate donations and membership.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Darlington County, South Carolina, Gibson was the son of a
brick mason and a schoolteacher. He became a dentist, and after
interning at Harlem Hospital in New York, returned to his hometown of
Greenville in 1959.</TE>
<TE>   While attending a voter registration meeting at Springfield
Baptist Church in 1961, he decided to devote his life to civil
rights. He organized the Black Council for Progress, a group that
helped boost blacks into local and state political offices during the
1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Gibson's commitment to voters' rights continued through his 1985
election as NAACP national board chairman. "The ballot is the most
important weapon we have," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after his election, Gibson told Jet magazine that the
Reagan administration was "anti-black, anti-woman, anti-minority and
anti-civil rights."</TE>
<TE>   He said the NAACP was "developing tactics and strategies to make
certain that the Reagan-created court will not turn back the clock as
it relates to blacks gaining their fair share in the public
marketplace."</TE>
<TE>   Elaborating in an article for Crisis, an NAACP publication, Gibson
wrote: "We are turning our political efforts toward our local
communities and to Congress, where we continue to secure important
victories for civil rights."</TE>
<TE>   According to Contemporary Black Biography, Gibson took the NAACP
in a new direction during his tenure as chairman in the '80s and
'90s. His agenda for the nation's largest civil rights group was
centered on the premise that it become more actively involved in the
nation's economy.</TE>
<TE>   "The economic arena is where the game is being played now," he
told Jet. "That's where the jobs are; that's where the power is."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said Gibson served others in his personal life as well,
providing free dental care to people who couldn't afford it.</TE>
<TE>   "Gibson's career represents a challenge to professionals who
sometimes immerse themselves in their work and their pursuit of
private success," Jackson said. "Gibson was of the lineage that you
became a professional so you could help more people."</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Lottie, and four sons.</TE>

<HD>Graffiti Artists in Santa Ana Have a Brush With Greatness</HD>
<DH>Art: Teens who ran afoul of city ordinance get a job and
guidance from a prominent Mexican painter, helping link Artists
Village, neighborhood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A prominent Mexican artist has taken under his wing a dozen graffiti
artists who butted heads with Santa Ana city officials last month
when they painted a mural on a downtown building without a permit.</LD>
<LD>   Vladimir Cora, a painter who divides his time between Santa Ana's
Artists Village and his native Nayarit, asked the teens to paint the
foundations for a sculpture, made of painted boards, titled "The
Twelve Apostles," which appears this weekend at a Los Angeles art
gallery. The show might eventually appear in the Artists Village, a
cluster of buildings in downtown Santa Ana where artists work and
live.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, city officials are working on Cora's request that
they find space for the teens to paint other large works for him for
small stipends.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not in favor of anyone breaking the law or putting their
lives on the line. This is my way to help, to rescue them," said
Cora, whose work has appeared in galleries in California and Latin
America. "They are making art. It's popular. But it's art. They
aren't gangsters. They need direction."</TE>
<TE>   Cora's effort is one of the few linking the Artists Village to the
working-class Latino neighborhood around it. Since the mid-1990s,
Santa Ana has invested more than $11 million in several arts-related
investments downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Like other projects that seek to draw investment to working-class
communities, the Artists Village created space too expensive for most
local residents to rent--roughly $600 to $900 a month. Rosters of the
artists in the buildings show few Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   "People feel intimidated by the Artists Village," said Carlos
Romero, an artist who had a studio in the village's Santora Building
on Broadway until the rent increased. "They see a lot of white people
come around. They see the high prices [of the art] and they don't see
how they fit in."</TE>
<TE>   Although a list of artists in the Santora building includes few
Latino surnames, city arts administrator Jim Gilliam said the
community is involved in the studios. The notion of a split is
mistaken, he said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, he said, the community attends the open gallery
nights.</TE>
<TE>   Connecting the city-ordered whitewashing of the mural to
neighborhood participation in the Artists Village is unfair, Gilliam
said. The mural was nothing more than a sign that had no permit, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   In March, a group of graffiti artists painted a jarring tableau of
block letters, a big red car and a cartoon figure on the side of a
Sycamore Street business that gave them permission.</TE>
<TE>   Residents contacted city officials, who, because the mural
included the name of the business, Rollin Auto Service, said it
constituted a sign.</TE>
<TE>   Because it lacked a permit, the mural was whitewashed. If the
mural weren't a sign, no city permission would be needed because the
wall is private property, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Rollin owner Ricardo Alatorre said he hadn't asked for the name of
the business to be included in the painting.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's against the rules, they have to take it down," he said.
"I felt bad for the kids, though. It really discouraged them."</TE>
<TE>   Cora's invitation to the teens made them nervous because they were
now in a relatively highbrow realm. Jessie Hernandes, a 16-year-old
who recently got his high school equivalency diploma and has been
arrested twice for graffiti vandalism, initiated the project.</TE>
<TE>   "It's cool because we've been hooked up" to the Artists Village,
Hernandes said. "But everyone here is all educated. They talk about
Picasso and Van Gogh and we just talk graffiti."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the incident's positive outcome, some artists remain
embittered and are working to get the mural back up.</TE>
<TE>   "They threw the baby out with the bathwater," said artist Gilbert
Vasquez, who does not rent space in the Artists Village. "We should
have just addressed the part that was considered signage. It's an
open secret that [some city officials] are opposed to murals and this
just solidified the resentment the community has about the Artists
Village."</TE>
<TE>   On his Web site, www.gilbertvasquez.com, he wrote an essay and put
up a photo of the work before it was whitewashed.</TE>
<TE>   "None of the community blood circulates in these buildings. It's
dead," he said. "There could be drawing classes, things to serve the
community. It's a mausoleum."</TE>
<TE>   Rigo Maldonado, who makes altars but can't afford village space,
agrees: "It's not a place for people from this neighborhood."
Maldonado has opened his downtown home to artists and put up works on
his lawn.</TE>
<TE>   Michael McGee, project facilitator at the Grand Central Arts
Center, a village building owned by Santa Ana and used by Cal State
Fullerton, says those complaining are merely "a fringe. Many people
are excited about what is happening. Downtown is more vibrant."</TE>
<TE>   The open-gallery night, the first Saturday of every month,
attracts 2,000 to downtown Santa Ana, he said. The facility, however,
is used mostly by artists who are students of the university. And of
27 living there, six are Latino and none are Mexican American, he
said. A few have held workshops drawing local high school students to
Grand Central.</TE>

<HD>Marine Just 'Reacted to Situation' to Save Driver</HD>
<DH>Crime: Tow truck operator, shot six times, says the
20-year-old lance corporal who carried him off while dodging bullets
saved his life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAMP PENDLETON</DL>
<LD>The wife of a tow truck driver shot six times by an enraged motorist
along Interstate 5 said Friday that her husband believes his life was
saved by the Marine who dragged him to safety while the gunman kept
firing.</LD>
<LD>   Melissa Naylor said her wounded husband, Brian, 23, tried to flag
down drivers for help during the Wednesday morning assault but cars
sped past.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Lance Cpl. Trevor Farley, 20, soon to be discharged
because of chronic knee problems, sprinted 100 yards, hopped a fence
and carried the dazed and bleeding Naylor nearly 150 yards to safety.</LD>
<TE>   The gunman, later identified as Henry Ricardo Enciso, 26, an
ex-convict from Duarte, fired twice at Farley as the Marine carried
Naylor toward an emergency phone along the freeway, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Enciso then fled into Camp Pendleton and was shot to death by
civilian and military police officers after refusing to surrender.</TE>
<TE>   "Brian told me: 'If [Farley] wasn't there, I'd be dead. That guy
wanted to kill me,'" Melissa Naylor said. "He wanted my husband's
life."</TE>
<TE>   Officials have yet to determine a motive for the crime, which
started when Naylor stopped to help a driver in a broken-down
Cadillac on the shoulder of the southbound lanes next to Camp
Pendleton.</TE>
<TE>   Melissa Naylor said her husband told her that the driver refused
his assistance and then became enraged when told that, under
California Highway Patrol rules, a tag would have to be put on his
car noting that assistance had been offered. The husband works for a
San Marcos company under contract with the CHP to help stranded
drivers.</TE>
<TE>   Naylor was shot six times in the abdomen, arm and lower back and
underwent surgery at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, where he
is expected to remain for four more days.</TE>
<TE>   Farley was attending a pre-discharge meeting in a base chapel next
to the freeway when the shooting began. He said he reacted
instinctively.</TE>
<TE>   "I just saw someone in need, so I reacted to the situation," said
Farley, of Chandler, Ariz., a truck driver in the Marine Corps. "At
the time, I wasn't concerned with myself."</TE>
<TE>   Melissa Naylor said of Farley, "He has a tremendous heart."</TE>
<TE>   Farley said he is still trying to adjust to being called a hero.</TE>
<TE>   "Being shot at changes the way food tastes--everything tastes a
little bit livelier than before," he said. "I never thought about any
kind of scenario like this happening to me."</TE>
<TE>   Marine officials said Farley is being nominated for a commendation
for bravery. Marines who know Farley said his actions were not
unexpected.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't surprise me," said Sgt. Major Shon Brodie. "I expect
great things from Marines."</TE>

<HD>Pasadena's Poor Lack Housing, Suit Claims</HD>
<DH>Court: Action calls for a ban on building until city
complies with law requiring a plan for low- income units. Officials
say they're trying.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOCELYN Y. STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Matilda Mitchell never wanted to leave Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   The city had been her home nearly all her life. It was where she
worked, went to school and was raising her son. The former store
clerk was one semester away from a degree at Pasadena City College.
Leaving was never part of her plan.</LD>
<LD>   But Mitchell searched all over Pasadena and could not find an
affordable apartment to replace the one she lost when new owners
raised rents and refused to accept her. Frustrated and weary,
Mitchell eventually left Pasadena to find housing. Now the city is
being taken to court, asked to answer for her dilemma and that of
other low-income residents.</LD>
<TE>   Housing advocates filed a lawsuit against Pasadena this week in
Los Angeles County Superior Court, alleging it has failed to comply
with a state law that requires cities to plan housing for low- and
very low-income residents. That failure has contributed to a scarcity
of housing for poor people, families with children and racial and
ethnic minorities in Pasadena, the suit alleges.</TE>
<TE>   The action asks the court to impose an injunction that would bring
a halt to all development--not just residential, but
commercial--until the city complies with state law.</TE>
<TE>   "We're saying enough is enough," said Neal Dudovitz, executive
director of Neighborhood Legal Services of Los Angeles County, which
brought the suit on behalf of Mitchell and Antonio Becerra, a father
of four. "Because land is limited, the longer we wait to get any real
housing for poor people, the less likely we'll get it."</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena City Manager Cynthia Kurtz said she has not seen the
lawsuit but that the city is trying to comply with the state's
housing law.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very confident that we are not at all shirking any
responsibility and in fact we are doing everything we can to get our
housing element updated," she said. "I'm also proud of our efforts in
affordable housing."</TE>
<TE>   Housing Advocates</TE>
<TE>   Turn to Courts</TE>
<TE>   As a statewide housing shortage has worsened, advocates throughout
the state are increasingly turning to courts for help in forcing
cities to plan for affordable housing. Without such planning,
advocates say, affordable housing simply doesn't get built.</TE>
<TE>   "It all starts with planning," said Michael Rawson, director of
the California Affordable Housing Law Project, who is co-counsel on
the Pasadena suit and has worked on several such lawsuits. "You can
have all the money in the world, but unless the land is zoned at the
right density, unless local government is willing to allow it to be
built rather than caving to NIMBY opposition, it never gets built."</TE>
<TE>   The Pasadena lawsuit follows a court ruling last month in a
similar suit filed against the city of Folsom. A judge upheld a
settlement that is expected to help significantly increase the number
of affordable housing units in the city.</TE>
<TE>   The Pasadena and Folsom cases are based on the state's housing
element law, which requires that municipalities submit plans every
five years that detail housing needs and include a precise plan for
helping to produce units to accommodate current and future
populations.</TE>
<TE>   But the law is controversial and cities often fail to comply. Most
suffer no penalties, except when sued by advocates. The law allows
judges to halt development in some cases.</TE>
<TE>   Rawson said many cities settle to prevent injunctions that would
cut off their development powers. "[Local officials] don't want their
powers to approve development stymied," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In August, state housing officials reviewed Pasadena's housing
element and found it to be out of compliance with state law on
several points. The city's housing element does not include an
adequate inventory of land suitable for residential development,
according to state officials.</TE>
<TE>   The city, meanwhile, continues to approve residential and
commercial development, amend zoning ordinances and issue building
permits, jeopardizing the prospects for affordable housing, the suit
alleges.</TE>
<TE>   In meetings with city officials, housing advocates expressed
concerns about the city's lack of housing for low-income residents.
They said the scarcity has produced overcrowding, substandard housing
and hardship for residents.</TE>
<TE>   "They do genuinely seem concerned about the lack of affordable
housing in Pasadena and the status of low-income people," said
Chancela Al-Mansour, of Neighborhood Legal Services. "The problem is
we're still not seeing any actual and positive change."</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena has a vacancy rate of 1% to 1.5%, city officials said.
The city does not have a rent control ordinance and the waiting list
for federal Section 8 housing subsidy is closed.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeing a lot of high-end units get constructed," said
Gregory Robinson, a city Housing and Community Development
administrator. "That is pushing the rents and the property values up
and making it more difficult for lower-income households to remain
residents of the city."</TE>
<TE>   The city recently implemented a housing ordinance that requires
market-rate developers to set aside 6% of their units for low-income
and moderate-income residents. In September, that rate will increase
to 15% for developments not yet under construction.</TE>
<TE>   "That was one of our ways of trying to assure that affordable
housing units will be available for our population," Robinson said.</TE>
<TE>   In June, the city will host a forum on affordable housing, seeking
more solutions.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not just folding our hands and saying we can't do
anything," Kurtz said.</TE>
<TE>   Renters Forced to Leave Town</TE>
<TE>   Advocates say the housing measure will do little to help very
low-income residents like Mitchell, whose troubles began in August
when she and other residents of their building learned they had to
move. Residents banded together, spoke before the City Council and
held a rally. Ultimately, it all failed.</TE>
<TE>   For three frustrating months Mitchell searched for another
apartment. Owners with vacancies would not accept her Section 8
subsidy, and she could not afford rent without the help. After months
of homelessness, living in a hotel and bunking with friends, she gave
up her Pasadena search and found an apartment miles away from her
friends, family and school.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm grateful that I'm here," she said, sitting in her apartment
on Normandie Avenue. "My son and I do have a place to live. I didn't
want to have to come to South-Central Los Angeles. I don't know
anything about this city. Nothing. And here I am."</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell said she knows of at least 10 others from her old
buildings who were forced to leave Pasadena. One is still homeless.</TE>
<TE>   The ordeal turned Mitchell into a passionate advocate for
affordable housing, but one still stunned by the battle. "We had
nowhere to go and nobody cared," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell, a onetime clerk and outreach worker for a city prenatal
care program, was working toward a degree in fashion. She said the
move forced her to drop out of school. And now she's unemployed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to put the pieces of my life back together," Mitchell
said.</TE>
<TE>   As she struggles to adjust to life in another city, Mitchell is
hoping to change things in her hometown.</TE>
<TE>   "Out of all of this, I want Pasadena to realize they need
affordable housing," she said. "Everybody is not in corporate
America."</TE>

<HD>A Corner of Hollywood Takes New Step Toward a Comeback</HD>
<DH>Development: Officials break ground for a $14-million
affordable housing project that is expected to help revitalize the
area.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE RAMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the early 1990s, prostitutes and drug dealers ruled the
intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and Western Avenue in Hollywood.
Sex shops were part of the corner's landscape.</LD>
<LD>   "People used to avoid Hollywood and Western like the plague,"
Democratic Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg remembered Friday as she
surveyed the corner. "Now, it's a place where families come in and
say, 'We want to live here.'"</LD>
<LD>   Goldberg, who represented the area when she was on the Los Angeles
City Council before she was elected to the Assembly, and others came
to the corner to celebrate the latest installment in its comeback. An
array of officials took part in a ceremonial groundbreaking for an
affordable housing project that will bring 61 new units to the area.</LD>
<TE>   The $14-million project, which includes 9,000 square feet of
commercial space and a child-care center, will add more units next to
the 60 affordable apartments completed in late 2000 on a site just
south of the Red Line subway station at Hollywood and Western.</TE>
<TE>   While officials praised the project, construction workers across
the street continued toiling to finish a development that will
include 100 low-income apartments for senior citizens and commercial
space for a Ralphs supermarket, a Starbucks coffee outlet and other
stores.</TE>
<TE>   At a third corner at the intersection, still more work on
commercial space was evident.</TE>
<TE>   The change at Hollywood and Western was cheered by at least one
onlooker who remembered what it was like in the old days.</TE>
<TE>   "There were women of the night doing their thing," recalled Rodney
Kline, 55, who watched the groundbreaking ceremony. "There were
drugs. Anything you wanted, you could get it here. I'm not joking."</TE>
<TE>   The new project at Hollywood and Western is one of several at
subway stops in Hollywood that many say are helping to revitalize the
area.</TE>
<TE>   Most notable among the new works is the $615-million development
at Hollywood and Highland Avenue. The Kodak Theatre, the new showcase
home for the annual Academy Awards ceremony, is a mainstay of the
Hollywood &amp; Highland commercial and entertainment complex, owned by
TrizecHahn Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg said the new Hollywood and Western project is just as
important as Hollywood &amp; Highland because it represents stability in
an area that has had little of it in the past.</TE>
<TE>   "People can have a normal life here," she said. "They can shop,
use the subway, do normal things."</TE>
<TE>   Intent on changing the area, Goldberg was credited for persuading
the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the city's Community
Redevelopment Agency, municipal housing officials and others to
support new development at the corner.</TE>
<TE>   The redevelopment agency and the MTA partnered with a developer,
McCormack Baron Salazar Inc., for the construction of the 60-unit
project, a $10-million effort. The three are major participants in
the new project.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of new affordable housing was lauded by residents who
live in the 60 units completed in late 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to live in a one-bedroom apartment near Highland," said
Clara Hurtado, a mother of three. "This is much better. I like the
area. I like my neighbors. I have no complaints."</TE>
<TE>   Hurtado's 8-year-old daughter, Julia, is especially happy with the
family's three-bedroom apartment because she has her own room with
space for her collection of Barbie dolls.</TE>
<TE>   "This is great," she said.</TE>

<HD>Ida Milgrom, 94; Sought Dissident Son's Freedom</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ida Milgrom, the mother of former Soviet dissident Anatoly
Shcharansky who stubbornly waged a nine-year battle for her son's
release from Soviet prison and labor camps, has died. She was 94.</LD>
<LD>   Milgrom, who suffered a stroke March 29 and never regained
consciousness, died Wednesday in Jerusalem.</LD>
<LD>   Shcharansky, a mathematician and computer specialist, had become
an outspoken leader among the refuseniks, as would-be emigres who
were prevented from leaving the Soviet Union were called, after his
visa was denied in the mid-'70s.</LD>
<TE>   He had planned to join his bride, Avital, who had immigrated to
Israel the day after they were married.</TE>
<TE>   Arrested in 1977, Shcharansky was convicted a year later on
charges of treason, espionage and anti-Soviet activities. He had been
accused of betraying secrets to the Central Intelligence Agency, a
charge that President Carter publicly denied.</TE>
<TE>   Shcharansky was sentenced to three years in prison, retroactive to
his arrest, and 10 years at hard labor.</TE>
<TE>   Just as Shcharansky stubbornly refused to admit to crimes he did
not commit, his tiny, white-haired mother stubbornly appealed to
authorities for his freedom and demanded that they ease her son's
living conditions in prison.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Shcharansky's wife waged her own battle to gain
her husband's freedom by traveling to Western countries to enlist
support.</TE>
<TE>   During the family's nine-year ordeal, Milgrom saw her son only six
times.</TE>
<TE>   On the few occasions she and her older son, Leonid, visited
Shcharansky, they had to travel 36 hours by train, then by bus, often
through subzero weather.</TE>
<TE>   The meetings were brief, only an hour; two at the most. A guard
would stand by as they spoke to one another, and though Milgrom
yearned to embrace her son, a glass partition separated them.</TE>
<TE>   But she was grateful for the time they had.</TE>
<TE>   "I would study his eyes, his voice, his expressions," she told the
Toronto Star in 1987. "Then, when the visit was over, I would analyze
his every gesture, and begin waiting for the next visit."</TE>
<TE>   Once, as punishment for Shcharansky, prison officials refused to
let his mother enter the prison. But she showed up at the prison gate
every morning for 10 days demanding, in vain, to see her son.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Milgrom received word that her son would be freed: As
part of an East-West exchange of prisoners, he would be flown from a
Soviet labor camp to East Berlin and from there to West Germany.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 11, 1986, Leonid Shcharansky drove his mother to a
friend's home in Moscow, where they were greeted by a throng of
reporters and television lights and cameras.</TE>
<TE>   There had been previous rumors over the years that her son, who
spent a total of 403 days in isolation cells, would be freed, and she
worried that she'd again be disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   Only when Leonid answered a telephone call from a reporter
informing him that his brother had safely passed into the West did
Milgrom allow herself to break down with great sobs of joy.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you believe it?" she exclaimed. "Tolya is free, God almighty,
Tolya is free! For so many years the placards read, 'Free
Shcharansky,' and now Shcharansky is free."</TE>
<TE>   Her son's freedom, however, did not end her activism.</TE>
<TE>   She logged thousands of miles traveling to meet with government
officials and American Jewish communities and spreading her message
that as long as thousands of Soviet dissidents and refuseniks were
denied visas to emigrate, freedom-loving people must continue to
demand their release.</TE>
<TE>   "I could never have imagined this is what would become of my
life," she told the Toronto Star in 1987. "There was never a day that
I didn't think of my son, never a moment that I didn't work for his
freedom.</TE>
<TE>   "But it wasn't I who freed him. It was the housewives around the
world who demonstrated, who went to rallies, who demanded his
release. That is why I am doing this now."</TE>
<TE>   Born Ida Petrovna Milgrom in Balta, Ukraine, in 1908, she was a
promising pianist who studied at the Moscow Tchaikovsky Conservancy.
She once explained that she gave up her plans of becoming a pianist
after hearing fellow student Vladimir Horowitz rehearsing.</TE>
<TE>   She then trained as an engineer-economist at the Odessa
Polytechnic Institute. While raising her sons, she worked first in
the metallurgy industry and then for the Soviet ministry of mining.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband, Boris Shcharansky, who worked for an industrial
journal when they met, died in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   After his release from prison, Anatoly Shcharansky moved to
Israel; six months later, his mother, his brother and his brother's
family received exit visas and were allowed to join him and his
family.</TE>
<TE>   Shcharansky, who took the name Natan Sharansky, became head of a
new-immigrants party and later rose to become Israel's minister of
trade and industry. He is now a deputy prime minister and head of a
Russian immigrants' party.</TE>
<TE>   His brother Leonid lives in Des Moines.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to her sons, Milgrom is survived by four
grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Blessed Are the Complete Idiots, for ...</HD>
<DH>Publishing: Minister's book in popular 'Guide to' series
that began with computer titles explains the life of Christ in simple
terms for the theologically challenged.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER Y. HONG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the Rev. William R. Grimbol told his wife, a fellow pastor, he
would be writing a book on the life of Christ for the popular
"Complete Idiot's Guide" series, she had one question: "How much do
we get?" The answer prompted her to dance around the living room,
singing "Pennies From Heaven."</LD>
<LD>   She wasn't entirely kidding. As any idiot who's been to a
bookstore knows, titles that start with "Complete Idiot's Guide to"
or end with "for Dummies" are big sellers. And religion books make up
one of publishing's most popular categories. It didn't take a genius
to put two and two together and see millions.</LD>
<LD>   There are now 23 "Complete Idiot's Guides" to various religious
subjects, with Grimbol's "The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Life of
Christ" among the more recent and successful offerings. They join
others in the line of books that began with a series of computer
guides in 1993 and now comprises about 500 titles selling 3 million
copies a year.</LD>
<TE>   Grimbol, 52, a Presbyterian minister in Shelter Island, a
community on Long Island, N.Y., included pithy insights in his guide
to the life of Christ, such as:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jesus was offensive to the people of his time, especially the
religious establishment, because of his close association to those
the world chose to reject and ridicule. Jesus befriended and
associated with the following:</TE>
<TE>   Sinners.</TE>
<TE>   Tax collectors.</TE>
<TE>   Women.</TE>
<TE>   Prostitutes.</TE>
<TE>   Samaritans.</TE>
<TE>   The poor.</TE>
<TE>   Lepers.</TE>
<TE>   The mentally ill.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If sales of the bright orange paperbacks seem limitless, so do the
topics. Some actual titles: "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Sex on the
Net" (we do the screening so you don't have to, claims the author);
"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Enhancing Self-Esteem"; "The Complete
Idiot's Guide to the Mafia"; and, logically enough, "The Complete
Idiot's Guide to Raising Your IQ."</TE>
<TE>   By 1997, convinced that few topics were so sacred as to be
off-limits for the series, and that sacred topics would sell,
publisher Alpha Books put out the first religious title, "The
Complete Idiot's Guide to World Religions." Today, said Alpha Books
vice president and publisher Marie Butler-Knight, religion "is one of
our strongest-performing categories for new titles."</TE>
<TE>   The series' top-selling title in major chain bookstores is now a
religion book, "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Understanding
Catholicism," Butler-Knight said.</TE>
<TE>   Butler-Knight said the books appeal to readers who want "a good
overview that is pleasurable as well as educational," and the editors
assume the audience has "an edgier sense of humor."</TE>
<TE>   But even with that assumption, Butler-Knight said there are lines
the editors will not cross: "We probably wouldn't do a guide to guns.
Certain topics are so sensitive we would not even consider them, like
abortion rights. We probably wouldn't do an 'Idiot's Guide to Death
and Dying.'" (However, there is a "Complete Idiot's Guide to Near
Death Experiences.")</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The writers of these books were not reporters.... They were
editors ....Some folks have a problem with the notion of Gospel
writers as editors. It implies these men may have manipulated the
material and presented their own version of the story. That is
exactly what they did, but they did so because they believed
themselves called to do so.</TE>
<TE>   --Grimbol's book on Christ</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who has used a preparation manual for, say, a driver's
license test knows the "Complete Idiot" format. There are short
chapters broken up into shorter subsections. The books are heavy on
white space, light on text, with graphic infoboxes and liberal use of
text bullets. Each chapter begins with an "In this chapter"
introductory box and ends with a "Least you need to know" summary.</TE>
<TE>   The instruction manual format is overlaid with gently sarcastic
headings and chapter titles. "The Complete Idiot's Guide to the
Bible," for instance, contains these titles on chapter summaries:
"Adam and Eve in the Brave Nude World (Genesis 2:4-25)"; "1,000
Prostitutes--No Waiting (1 Corinthians 1:1-8)"; "Hebrews: Everything
Old Is New Again"; and, for a passage summarizing the destruction of
Sodom and Gomorrah, "Hot Time in the Cities (Genesis 19:1-29)."</TE>
<TE>   "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Zen Living" divides its infoboxes
into categories and labels them. "One Hand Clapping" boxes contain
Zen wisdom "and other information that adds to or expands upon each
chapter." Whereas "Monkey Mind" boxes "supply you with things to
watch out for, be careful of or avoid." They are bluntly practical.
One "Monkey Mind" box alerts readers that "Randomly changing jobs or
quitting a job you dislike probably won't do you any good ....Living
Zen ... doesn't mean financial irresponsibility."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One of the standard Smothers Brothers bits was the accusation the
two used to level at each other that "Momma always loved you
more".... Their sufferings pale, however, to those of Jacob's son
Joseph. As we will see, Joseph spent his entire life trying to
overcome the aftermath of being his father's favorite.</TE>
<TE>   --From "The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Bible"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Grimbol said the distilled style and purpose of the "Idiot" books
actually parallels a method ministers exercise regularly. "They are
like sermons," he said. "It gives you enough engaging material so
that you might want to keep looking."</TE>
<TE>   Grimbol, who has been a clergyman for 25 years, said he did not
duck controversy. For example, he said his book on Christ reflects
his view that "Jesus Christ was not a capitalist." Grimbol writes
that when Jesus spoke of an abundant life, "he did not mean owning
more and more stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Grimbol acknowledges the apparent contradiction between what he
preaches and his delivery of the message through books that are a
branded, packaged, marketed product--and a lucrative one at that. But
he says he's not using his royalty checks to live lavishly.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got six teenagers living in my house now and two of them
will be going to college soon," he said, "I'm just paying bills."</TE>

<HD>Tijuana Officer Found Shot to Death</HD>
<DH>Crime: Mexican police officials think the killing could be
revenge for the man's role in the arrest of three kidnap suspects. It
is the third death of a Tijuana officer this year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A Tijuana police officer has been found slain, a possible revenge
killing for his role in the apprehension of three suspected
kidnappers three months ago, Mexican police officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The body of Jose Elias Santana Lopez, 38, was discovered Tuesday
night in the back seat of his Jeep Cherokee on a dirt road in a poor
neighborhood of Tijuana, his hands handcuffed behind his back, with
two gunshots to his head.</LD>
<LD>   He had gone out that night to buy beer at a market near his home,
leaving his gun at home, said Raul Garcia, a spokesman for the
Tijuana Police Department.</LD>
<TE>   When he didn't return, his family called authorities, who found
his car in the Planetario neighborhood about 11:45 p.m., the motor
running.</TE>
<TE>   Police officials are very "upset and angry" about the slaying, the
third death of a Tijuana police officer this year, Garcia said.</TE>
<TE>   Santana's family told police that he had been receiving death
threats, which officials believe were connected to his role in the
arrests of three suspected kidnappers Jan. 25.</TE>
<TE>   He helped detain the suspects, but not before they engaged in a
bloody shootout, killing two police officers and a woman they had
abducted. Two other officers were wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Santana's death is being investigated by the state police, who
have not determined the motive for the shooting, said Raul Gutierrez,
a spokesman for the state attorney general's office.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are waiting for the autopsy report and have just
begun interviewing witnesses, Gutierrez said.</TE>
<TE>   "At the moment, we don't know whether it had to do with what
happened that day," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Police officials said that on Jan.25, a gang posing as state
police officers kidnapped Jose Martinez Velasquez from a Tijuana
hotel and ordered him to call his family and ask for $200,000 to
secure his release.</TE>
<TE>   A week later, Martinez escaped from the third floor of a house
where he was being held and made his way to the nearby U.S.
Consulate, where officials alerted police.</TE>
<TE>   Guided by Martinez, police officials went to the house where he
had been held and began chasing a car belonging to the suspected
kidnappers, one of whom got out and shot at the officers, wounding
two.</TE>
<TE>   In the gun battle that followed, two officers were killed, and
officials found the body of a woman, who also had been kidnapped, in
a nearby house, her throat slit.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the suspects were detained and are in custody facing
trial, including a 27-year-old Los Angeles man, Fidel Munguia
Corrales, known as "El Junior," who is thought to be the head of the
gang.</TE>
<TE>   Police believe at least one of the suspected kidnappers escaped.</TE>

<HD>Klamath Farmers Applaud Ruling</HD>
<DH>Environment: Citing lack of evidence that higher river
flows would help salmon, a judge refuses bid for temporary order
sought by activists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH SCHOCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge declined Friday to order Klamath River water flows
increased to benefit rare coho salmon, concluding that she lacked
scientific evidence that the fish would be harmed if river flows
remain at their current level.</LD>
<LD>   Coming in response to a suit brought by a group of commercial
fishermen and environmentalists, the ruling by U.S. District Judge
Saundra B. Armstrong was a victory for Klamath Basin farmers, who had
feared that a court order boosting water for salmon would mean less
water for their farms, triggering a repeat of last summer's crisis of
parched fields along the California-Oregon border.</LD>
<LD>   The farmers receive their water from a 95-year-old U.S. Bureau of
Reclamation irrigation project that diverts water from the Klamath
River's source.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm happy. I'm relieved. It's the right conclusion. It's the
right outcome," said Paul Simmons, the attorney representing the
Klamath Water Users Assn..</TE>
<TE>   The ruling underscored a pivotal legal question in the continuing
Klamath River controversy: How much evidence is needed to prove an
animal or plant is threatened with extinction under the U.S.
Endangered Species Act?</TE>
<TE>   Fishermen and environmental groups filed suit last week and also
took the unusual step of requesting a temporary restraining order,
hoping to get water to fish immediately. Such orders must meet a
higher standard of proof than typical legal actions. The groups plan
to press on with the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton, issued a statement commending
the judge for upholding the National Marine Fisheries Service's March
determination "that project operations in April and May will not
significantly affect coho salmon."</TE>
<TE>   Anglers, environmentalists and Native Americans who sought the
order said they remain convinced of the merits of their suit against
the Bush administration, insisting that young coho salmon receive too
little springtime water to sustain them under the current system.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs were clearly disappointed by the decision by
Armstrong not to grant an order immediately giving more water to
salmon.</TE>
<TE>   They call the coming weeks crucial for the survival of young
salmon, as the tiny fry grow and feed in shallow water at the river's
edge, and as 1-year-old coho swim toward the sea.</TE>
<TE>   "We gave it our best shot and lost," said Kristen Boyles, an
attorney with Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund. "I have to be honest.
For the May flows, the case is pretty much dead."</TE>
<TE>   Boyles represents the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen and
six environmental groups in the suit. Two Native American tribes
filed papers supporting the motion.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Armstrong criticized the Bureau of Reclamation for giving
the National Marine Fisheries Service only one day to review how the
bureau's April and May flow plans would affect the fish. The
fisheries service is charged with protecting coho salmon, which are
listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.</TE>
<TE>   In its counter-argument, the government relied heavily on a report
issued this winter by a National Academy of Sciences panel. The
report said insufficient scientific evidence exists to support the
fisheries service's 2001 decision that the coho need more water. That
decision helped prompt a water shut-off to farmers last year and
triggered a fierce fight over the Endangered Species Act.</TE>
<TE>   Another study has been commissioned by the U.S. Department of the
Interior. That report, by Thomas E. Hardy, a professor of civil and
environmental engineering at Utah State University, will be released
in the next few months.</TE>
<TE>   Hardy's study recommends that in May coho and other salmon need
well over 2,000 cubic feet per second of water released below Iron
Gate Dam, which divides the upper and lower Klamath River basins.</TE>
<TE>   The bureau is releasing less than 1,400 cubic feet, a level
approved by the fisheries service. A draft of Hardy's study was cited
at length by fishermen and environmentalists in their argument that
more water is needed for salmon.</TE>
<TE>   But Armstrong added that those requesting the order did not
provide sufficient scientific evidence that coho would be harmed
without more water. And, she questioned whether she could rely on a
study still in draft form.</TE>
<TE>   Hardy said Friday that he has learned nothing new that would
suggest that the recommendations in his draft will be substantively
altered in the final version.</TE>
<TE>   Late Friday, however, Jeff McCracken, a spokesman for the Bureau
of Reclamation, announced that water flows to the lower Klamath River
will be increased to 1,700 cubic feet per second for several days
because two reservoirs behind Iron Gate Dam are full and need to be
lowered.</TE>
<TE>   McCracken added that the increased water flow is not related to
the recent stranding of young coho salmon below the dam.</TE>
<TE>   The executive director of the Klamath Water Users' Assn. released
a statement Friday expressing relief that another water shut-off was
not ordered Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "We are pleased that rushed and rash behavior has not been awarded
by Judge Armstrong," said Dan Keppen. "She should not be expected to
make a decision that approves sketchy scientific justification with
only a few days' time. Now is the time to come together and focus our
energies on long-term fixes to the Klamath Basin."</TE>

<HD>Masry Portrayed as No Hollywood Hero in Harassment Suit</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jurors in a sexual harassment case heard attorney Ed Masry portrayed
far differently in court Friday than he was in the movie that made
him famous as the good-guy employer of Erin Brockovich.</LD>
<LD>   Masry, now mayor of Thousand Oaks, subjected newly hired attorney
Kissandra Cohen to a barrage of crude sexual language and unwanted
touching, Cohen's lawyer, Dan Marino, said during opening statements
in a Van Nuys courtroom.</LD>
<LD>   Nothing improper took place, countered Norm Watkins, one of
several lawyers defending Masry, 69, in the civil suit. Cohen, now
23, was fired from Masry's law firm in December 1999 because she
allegedly misrepresented her credentials when she was hired early
that year, first as a $40-an-hour office clerk and then as a
$120,000-a-year attorney after she passed the bar exam that summer,
Watkins said.</LD>
<TE>   Suggestive language from Masry and at least one other staff
attorney was constant, Marino said. Cohen was humiliated, he said,
when Masry handed her $50 in front of co-workers--repayment for
office snacks purchased the previous day--and said, "That's for the
sexual favors last night."</TE>
<TE>   Masry and others in the firm of Masry&amp;Vittitoe, including movie
namesake Brockovich, used constant sexual epithets and four-letter
words, Marino told the jury.</TE>
<TE>   James Brown, Cohen's supervising attorney, repeatedly tried to get
Cohen to date him, and left a lollipop in the shape of male private
parts with a note for Cohen that said, "Suck on this," Marino told
the jury.</TE>
<TE>   He said she "blew off" some of the activity that bothered her. On
several occasions, when Masry rubbed her shoulders in her office or
put his hand on her leg at a restaurant, she asked him to stop, but
Masry continued, according to Marino.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins dismissed the allegations as fabrications or
overreactions. Cohen was fired, he said, because she lied about
several work-related issues. She falsely claimed that she graduated
at the top of her law school class, he said. She failed to apply for
a morals certification required of newly minted lawyers by the state
bar, and lied to the firm by saying that it had been delayed by a
clerical error, Watkins said.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen has been featured in print and broadcast stories as possibly
the youngest practicing attorney in the United States. She said that
since her firing by Masry 21/2 years ago, she has been unable to find
a job with another law firm.</TE>
<TE>   Marino said the presentation of his case will take up only a few
of the 20 days the trial is expected to take. He told the jury that
Masry, with a "platoon" of lawyers at his side, will spend the bulk
of the trial trying to smear Cohen's character.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom of Superior Court Judge Stanley Weis- berg,
Cohen said she is undaunted by that possibility.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel I have to stand up for myself," she said. "Rather than
deal with the issues in the case, they want to attack me and compound
what they've already done to me."</TE>

<DH>Trial: Harassment case brought by ex-employee portrays

<LD>Jurors in a sexual harassment case heard attorney Ed Masry portrayed
far differently in court Friday than he was in the movie that made
him famous as the good-guy employer of Erin Brockovich.</LD>
<LD>   Masry, now mayor of Thousand Oaks, subjected newly hired attorney

<TE>   James Brown, Cohen's supervising attorney, repeatedly tried to get
Cohen to date him, and left a lollipop in the shape of male private
parts with a note for Cohen that said, "Suck on this," Marino told
the eight-woman, four-man jury. Marino said it was part of a "day in,
day out" pattern of harassment of Cohen.</TE>
<TE>   He said she "blew off" some of the activity that bothered her. On
several occasions, when Masry rubbed her shoulders in her office or

<TE>   Masry, who has become something of a celebrity since "Erin
Brockovich" was released, initially was proud to have Cohen on his
staff, Watkins said. Masry does not dispute that he once described
her as "brilliant" and his "No. 1 draft choice."</TE>
<TE>   Cohen has been featured in print and broadcast stories as possibly

<HD>Inspiring Young Minds With Classical Music</HD>
<DH>Education: Volunteers from L.A. Philharmonic help schools
introduce arts in class. Children are enthusiastic about the new
exposure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Catherine Ransom rattled off the names of the most famous classical
composers she could think of, waiting for the fourth-graders to
identify their favorites.</LD>
<LD>   But Beethoven, Brahms and Mozart didn't prompt even a flicker of
recognition across any of the children's faces at the Hollywood
elementary school the professional flutist was visiting as a
volunteer.</LD>
<LD>   "I was saying the names of some really mainstream, relevant
people, and none of them knew who they were," said Ransom, who joined
the Los Angeles Philharmonic six years ago. "That's the kind of thing
where I go, my God, that's got to change."</LD>
<TE>   That is changing in the classrooms where Ransom and other
musicians started volunteering this year for a Philharmonic effort to
reach children whose musical background is more Backstreet Boys than
Bach.</TE>
<TE>   The Philharmonic's School Partners initiative brings arts
professionals and a classical music curriculum to five elementary
schools in Los Angeles County and follows the children for at least
three years. Middle and high schools are set to be added in the next
two years.</TE>
<TE>   Five Philharmonic musicians, including second-chair flutist
Ransom, each visit the schools six times, and about a dozen other
arts professionals lend their skills in dance, choreography or
composition. Students and their families are also taken to
Philharmonic concerts in downtown Los Angeles, several fine-tuned for
children--shorter length, perkier music and more casual dress.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to learning basic musical concepts, third-graders
study percussion, fourth-graders learn to play the recorder, and
fifth-graders compose and perform the second movement of a work about
a girl who wishes gravity didn't exist.</TE>
<TE>   "It's crucial to reach the students at all levels, both those who
just have to hear the music to respond and those who really get
engaged by making the music themselves," said Llewellyn Crain, the
Philharmonic's director of education initiatives. "Anything we can do
to enhance what the music teacher does is really vital, since they're
already stretched in so many different ways."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Unified provides one day of music instruction for each
of its district's schools, which then can use their own discretionary
funding to pay for additional days. Santa Monica Boulevard Elementary
in Hollywood funds four extra days, and Ransom's work there comes as
a welcome bonus.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always more work to do than each of us can do alone,"
said Richard Burrows, director of the Los Angeles Unified's arts
education branch. "I'm thrilled to have School Partners in our
district. The different styles and ways that outside agencies do
things call upon students to expand their minds."</TE>
<TE>   Arts Incorporated Into Academics</TE>
<TE>   The schools in the program, chosen through a lengthy application
process last year, are given tips on incorporating music into other
academic subjects such as math and history. Third-graders in Odette
Guzman's class at the Hollywood school divide musical notes into
fourths and quarters and learn about the life of "Mr. Bach."</TE>
<TE>   Ransom, 34, chose to focus on Bach because of his extensive flute
music. As his music poured from her instrument during a recent
session, children were told to draw what the music made them feel.</TE>
<TE>   One boy colored a large square brown to honor Bach's "Coffee
Cantata," while others drew scenes from their own lives, including a
funeral and two hamsters pushing a soccer ball across a rug.</TE>
<TE>   "The things I saw and heard from the children were amazing,"
Ransom said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really neat to be able to pull that out of some of the
quieter kids who perhaps never had a chance to blossom before."</TE>
<TE>   Fifth-grade students collaborated with other professional
musicians for three months to compose the second movement of
"Gwendolyn Gets Her Wish."</TE>
<TE>   The 20-minute performance tells the story of a girl who blames
gravity for her messy room, complaining the force makes her toys fall
out of place. During the second movement, the stars grant Gwendolyn's
wish that gravity be suspended and the actors pretend to float around
as their classmates play a raucous, screeching percussion medley.</TE>
<TE>   The student musicians chose their own instruments, ranging from
African bells and cymbals to coil drums, purple cans that make a
thundering sound when shaken, all provided by the Philharmonic.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica Boulevard's Karina Villeda chose a vibratone, which
resembles a metal pipe that the musician strikes with a small baton,
because she liked its low sound. The "Gwendolyn" rehearsals helped
her grasp the role teamwork plays in music.</TE>
<TE>   "We really have to interact and listen to each other to get the
sound right, all those different kinds of beats and instruments
working together," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Fifth-grade teacher Tina Athans, who hears the children humming
the Gwendolyn music in class, marveled at the volunteers' effect on
the children.</TE>
<TE>   "They're magicians," she said. "I've never seen so many children
so completely focused."</TE>
<TE>   A group of students from Breed Street Elementary in East Los
Angeles came to a Philharmonic board meeting three weeks ago to play
their recorders and talk about how music had changed their lives,
entrancing officials as they squeaked out "Ode to Joy" and "Mary Had
a Little Lamb."</TE>
<TE>   "If anybody had a question about the worthiness of the program,
this answered it," said Philharmonic Assn. managing director Deborah
Borda. "You couldn't come in and fake something that powerful."</TE>
<TE>   Making Students Think Differently About Music</TE>
<TE>   At Moffett Elementary in Lennox, a school so close to LAX that it
was built almost entirely underground with no windows, Philharmonic
harpist Lou Anne Neill entranced the children.</TE>
<TE>   "When she was playing in the fifth-grade class, a boy raised his
hand and said, 'When you're playing, is the music ever so beautiful
that you feel like crying?'" said Jo Ann Isken, the school's
principal. "I would venture to say that he had never thought that way
about music before."</TE>
<TE>   Neill let the nearly 200 students she met pluck her harp's strings
after playing several Bach compositions.</TE>
<TE>   "In a sense, it doesn't matter what I played, but I wanted to give
them something really, really good so they could have it to enrich
their lives," said Neill, 55, a 19-year Philharmonic veteran. "Even
if they didn't know what they were hearing right when I played it,
the music went inside and will be there to inspire them."</TE>

<HD>Norman B. Chandler, 49; Former Times Executive</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Norman Brant Chandler, a former executive with the Los Angeles Times
and the first member of the fifth generation of the Chandler family
to establish a career with the newspaper, died Friday. He was 49.</LD>
<LD>   His father, Otis Chandler, publisher of the paper from 1960 to
1980, said his eldest son died at his home in Ojai of complications
from a brain tumor.</LD>
<LD>   An avid sportsman like his father, Norman Chandler was training
for a triathlon event in 1989 when he collapsed and was diagnosed
with a brain tumor.</LD>
<TE>   He was a skilled surfer, an excellent swimmer and also shared his
father's passion for auto racing. He participated in the Baja 1000
off-road race several times.</TE>
<TE>   Although in failing health in the last decade, he pursued
photography and painting and, until recently, kept up a regimen of
physical therapy that included swimming.</TE>
<TE>   Born in San Marino, Norman Chandler attended Polytechnic School in
Pasadena and the Cate School in Carpinteria. He was a National Merit
Scholarship finalist when he graduated in 1970. He went on to Yale
University, later transferring to Stanford, where he earned a degree
in communications.</TE>
<TE>   He came to The Times in 1976, working in several departments in an
executive training program.</TE>
<TE>   His earliest assignments included working in the dispatch and
composing departments in production, as a machinist's assistant and
as a copy messenger in the newsroom.</TE>
<TE>   He then joined the Orange County edition and the now-defunct
Southeast Los Angeles County bureau as a reporter-photographer
trainee, before working as a reporter at several overseas Times
bureaus. He said years later that his experiences abroad deepened his
interest in journalism and led him to rule out other professions.</TE>
<TE>   When he returned to Los Angeles, he sought more experience in the
newspaper's technical operations and worked as an assistant
production manager at the downtown plant and as production
superintendent in the San Fernando Valley operation. He also was
circulation manager of the Greenwich (Conn.) Times and studied
management principles with the Gannett Newspapers at the Honolulu
Star-Bulletin.</TE>
<TE>   He was named composing superintendent of the Los Angeles Times in
1987. In that role, Chandler managed many of the departments that
were integral to the final page production of the paper.</TE>
<TE>   The Chandler family controlled The Times for more than a century,
beginning in 1884. The Times and its parent company, Times Mirror,
were purchased by Tribune Co. in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Norman Chandler was the great-great-grandson of Gen. Harrison Gray
Otis, who bought part-ownership of The Times in 1882, a year after it
began publication and served as its publisher for 35 years.</TE>
<TE>   Norman Chandler's great-grandfather was Harry Chandler, the Times'
second publisher; his grandfather, Norman Chandler, was the third
publisher, and his father, Otis Chandler, was the paper's fourth and
last family member to hold the title.</TE>
<TE>   In 1976, Norman Chandler married Jane Emilie Yeager, and they had
four children: Otis, Christopher, Dana and Jenna. They survive him,
as do his father; his mother, Marilyn Brant DeYoung; brothers Harry
and Michael Chandler; sisters Cathleen Eckhardt and Carolyn Chandler;
grandmother Jane Mawn Brant Ward; stepmother Bettina Chandler; and
stepfather Patrick DeYoung.</TE>
<TE>   There will be a memorial service at 4 p.m. Sunday at St. Andrews
Episcopal Church, 409 Topa Topa Drive in Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   The family requests that there be no flowers and that all
donations be sent to St. Andrews Episcopal Church in Ojai.</TE>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A 2-year-old Brazilian girl kidnapped by smugglers and held for
ransom in Mexico was returned to her mother after Border Patrol
agents detained the woman attempting to cross the border illegally
and learned of the abduction.</LD>
<LD>   After determining that the child was being held at a hotel in
Mexicali, Mexico, Border Patrol agents notified Mexican immigration
officials, who rescued the child and took her abductor into custody.</LD>
<LD>   The toddler was handed over to U.S. officials at the border late
Wednesday night and reunited with her mother and 9-year-old sister,
Border Patrol officials said.</LD>
<TE>   "The consulate was just in an uproar trying to find the girl,"
said Adriana Coogan, a staff member at the Brazilian Consulate in Los
Angeles who worked on the case.</TE>
<TE>   "You can imagine a 2-year-old in the hands of strange people. We
don't know what they could have done."</TE>
<TE>   The family is now being detained in a facility for women and
children in San Diego, where the mother and the 9-year-old face
charges of entering the U.S. illegally, said Lauren Mack, a
spokeswoman for the San Diego office of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. A hearing will be held within a month.</TE>
<TE>   The woman and her daughters are just a few of many Brazilians who
attempt to enter the United States through Mexico. After Mexicans,
Brazilians make up one of the largest group of undocumented
immigrants arrested in San Diego, according to Border Patrol
officials.</TE>
<TE>   The 32-year-old San Paolo woman--whose name is being
withheld--flew to Mexico from Brazil with her two daughters on
Monday, apparently hoping to cross the border to join her husband,
who lives in Boston, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The family reached Mexicali and was traveling north with a group
of smugglers and other migrants.</TE>
<TE>   But before they crossed the border, the smugglers took the toddler
away from the woman.</TE>
<TE>   The child was taken back to Mexicali and held there to extort more
money from the woman, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "You're dealing with one of the most ruthless bunches of people,"
said Michael McGlasson, a spokesman for the Border Patrol office in
Yuma, Ariz. "All they care about is getting your cash."</TE>
<TE>   Border Patrol agents caught the group of 12 in a Ford Bronco on
Tuesday as they drove through the desert near the All-American Canal,
seven miles northwest of Yuma.</TE>
<TE>   As agents questioned the migrants, the Brazilian woman burst into
tears and said her daughter had been kidnapped.</TE>
<TE>   A Portuguese-speaking agent from the San Diego office was brought
in to interpret, and officials determined that the driver of the
Bronco knew where the child was being held.</TE>
<TE>   Border Patrol agents contacted the Mexican and Brazilian
consulates, along with Mexican immigration officials, who found the
child at the Plaza Hotel in Mexicali. A woman with the child was
arrested on suspicion of kidnapping.</TE>

<LD>A federal judge refused to add $30 million in interest to former
Playboy Playmate Anna Nicole Smith's $88-million award from her dead
husband's estate.</LD>
<LD>   Smith's attorney, Philip W. Boesch, asked for the additional money
on April 15, telling the court it represents the interest Smith would
have earned on the settlement she was awarded in March from oil
tycoon J. Howard Marshall's estate.</LD>
<LD>   But U.S. District Court Judge David O. Carter ruled Thursday that
Smith will have to get along with the $88 million.</LD>

<HD>Postal Carrier Finds a Way Through Animal Kingdom Maze ...
and Delivers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's easy to make fun of postal goofs, as I did the other day. But
it's even easier to forget how often the post office manages to
deliver misaddressed letters to the correct destinations. Jean Beaver
recalls that when she lived on Tigertail Drive in Rossmoor, she wrote
to a swim school for a brochure.</LD>
<LD>   And she received it, even though it was addressed to Mr. and Mrs.
Tiger. On Beavertail Drive.</LD>
<LD>   She has to play the whole game, every game: If you think the
players are tired by the 14th inning of a baseball game, how about
the organist? Dodger Stadium's Nancy Bea Hefley was equal to the task
during Thursday night's four-hour match with the Reds.</LD>
<TE>   "At the top of the 12th inning, she played, '12th of Never,'"
reports season ticket holder Michael Horowicz. "In the middle of the
12th, with most of the fans gone, she played, 'Alone Again,
Naturally.' She followed those with 'Rock Around the Clock' and 'I
Could Have Danced All Night.' Then, in the middle of the 14th,"
Horowicz said, "we had something unusual: a second seventh-inning
stretch, and Nancy Bea played 'Take Me Out to the Ballgame' for the
second time."</TE>
<TE>   By then, I would have had trouble sounding convincing while
singing one lyric in the baseball song: "I don't care if I never get
back...."</TE>
<TE>   Let us prey on typos and other curiosities: In still another
attempt to increase this column's audience, I'm instituting a
religion section. Today's offerings (see accompanying) are:</TE>
<TE>   * A car that runs with real authority (snapped by Barbara
Aspenson)</TE>
<TE>   * A weird yard sale (Ann Orcutt of Fullerton)</TE>
<TE>   * A place where parking is so scarce that even saints can't march
in</TE>
<TE>   * And, a church where, H.J. Loether of Rancho Palos Verdes
observes, "the pastor invoked the 11th commandment in order to avoid
traffic problems."</TE>
<TE>   A college didn't do its homework: I've read that colleges are
becoming aggressive in attempts to recruit star students, but some
appear to be going too far. Emily Leventhal of Long Beach recently
received a letter that said: "Do the math and you'll see that the
sooner you get your master's degree, the more extra money you can
earn. So isn't it time you got your MBA from Keller Graduate School
of Management?" Responds her father, Tom: "I would love to see Emily
get her master's degree, but I think she should finish the third
grade first." Emily is 8 years old.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of strange communications: Paul Shefrin of L.A. passed
along a response that his friend Alan Radin received after applying
for a credit card from Capital One Bank. The bank said "we regret"
that the applicant "is reported as deceased." Which, of course, was
news to Radin.</TE>
<TE>   Marquee madness (cont.): Barbara Meyer writes: "If you can stand
one more theatre sign ... In 1939 (I was 11), one combination made
the Newark Evening News: TARZAN FINDS A SON/NAUGHTY BUT NICE."</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: You call yourself a caring person, but did you know
that open convertibles pose special problems for cell phone addicts?
Dennis Mahoney noticed a young driver "who was holding the phone to
his face with his right hand and covering his ear with his left hand
to shut out the freeway noise." As for steering wheel duties in that
car, you know the old expression: Leave the driving to the knees.</TE>

<HD>Ice Plant Getting Cold Reception From Naturalists</HD>
<DH>Fast-spreading, it crowds out native species, alters soil
chemistry and may promote erosion. People are removing it from
coastal areas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GABRIEL SPITZER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>South of the Ft. Funston native plant nursery in the Golden Gate
National Recreation Area, the air is full of the warbles of robins,
thrushes and white-crowned sparrows. The birds patrol the hillsides
in search of insects among the lupines, lizard tail and coyote brush
that crowd the landscape.</LD>
<LD>   But turn around to face the flats directly to the north, and all
is silent. Instead of a textured, silvery-green palate of native
plants, the area is dominated by one species: ice plant.</LD>
<LD>   "It looks green, but to wildlife it may as well be concrete," said
George Durgerian, a park ranger at Ft. Funston.</LD>
<TE>   Ice plant carpets California's coastal bluffs from Baja California
to the Oregon border, where its yellow and pink flowers and fleshy
green leaves are familiar features of the landscape.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, ice plant is so familiar that for decades, many assumed
it was a native California plant. But the springy succulent is not.
Ice plant (Carpobrotus edulis) is an invasive species, which
out-competes native flora. It is crowding out several threatened and
endangered plant species and menacing the birds and small mammals
that depend on those plants. It also alters soil chemistry and may
hasten erosion in certain areas.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a well-recorded threat to indigenous ecosystems," said Jake
Sigg, chairman of the invasive exotics committee of the California
Native Plant Society. "People concerned about saving biological
diversity are worried about whole biological communities being
invaded and displaced."</TE>
<TE>   Ice plant, native to South Africa, is not the biggest threat to
California's ecosystems. Other invaders, such as scotch broom and
tamarisk, imperil native plants more directly and are harder to root
out. But in places where ice plant has taken hold, particularly in
sensitive ecosystems such as coastal dunes and prairie, it can
devastate indigenous species.</TE>
<TE>   "Within those coastal areas, it's a very serious problem," said
botanist Peter Connors, reserve manager at the UC Davis Bodega Marine
Laboratory. "It sends runners out over the surface and it will cover
over all the surrounding grassland, and exclude everything else. It's
almost a total loss of whatever plant community was there in the
first place."</TE>
<TE>   At Ft. Funston, rangers say that as recently as 70 years ago, the
250-acre area was covered by native plants. But when the area became
an active Army base in mid-century, the Army plowed over the sand
dunes and planted ice plant. By the late 1980s, it carpeted nearly
all of Ft. Funston.</TE>
<TE>   Now rangers and volunteers are removing it from large swaths of
land and reseeding native plants. The need to eradicate was
especially urgent on some of the coastal cliffs, which provide homes
for the bank swallow, a threatened species in California.</TE>
<TE>   This brown and white bird, North America's smallest swallow, nests
on near-vertical banks and cliffs. At Ft. Funston, ice plant had
overgrown most of the seaside cliff faces, disrupting the bank
swallow's habitat.</TE>
<TE>   Volunteers are also removing ice plant from the El Segundo dunes
along the Santa Monica Bay. There, ice plant has displaced the
once-abundant coast buckwheat, the primary food source for the
endangered El Segundo blue butterfly. As the coast buckwheat
population has dwindled, so have the butterflies.</TE>
<TE>   Ice plant can crowd out sensitive plant species as well. The showy
Indian clover, which produces bright purple-and-white flowers, was
thought to be extinct until Peter Connors of the Bodega Marine
Laboratory discovered one. Since then, a small population has grown
in Marin County. But that would likely disappear if Connors and
others didn't vigilantly remove the encroaching ice plant.</TE>
<TE>   One reason ice plant is so insidious is that it changes the soil
chemistry in ways that are still not fully understood.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not entirely clear how persistent the changes are and how
bad they are for restoration," said Carla D'Antonio, associate
professor of integrated biology at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   D'Antonio said ice plant makes the soil more acidic and reduces
levels of calcium, magnesium and other minerals. This could make it
more difficult to replace ice plant with native plants.</TE>
<TE>   Ice plant also spreads quickly. Connors estimated that the
circular patches spread at a rate of about 3 feet in radius each
year.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently this was considered a good thing.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans used to plant ice plant along highway and road
embankments, partly because it was cheap and spread quickly.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1930s, the California Conservation Corps planted it widely
to control erosion. But on steep hill faces, ice plant can exacerbate
erosion. As the plant covering builds, the weight of it can pull down
whole sheets of topsoil, conservationists say.</TE>
<TE>   "It builds up tremendous biomass, and the cliffs sometimes
collapse under the weight," said Sigg, adding that native plants,
with their variety of root systems, anchor the soil better. "These
native plants have been here for thousands of years, and they've been
doing very well, thank you."</TE>
<TE>   No regulations prevent cultivating or selling ice plant, and it is
available at many nurseries.</TE>
<TE>   "It's blamed right now for being a terrible plant. We can't see
the logic to that," said Jack Wick, regulatory consultant for the
California Assn. of Nurserymen. "It doesn't make sense to stop
selling something that's already scattered all over."</TE>
<TE>   Wick said the association cooperates with coordinated efforts to
eradicate certain species. The difficulty, he said, is that species
like ice plant are problems only in certain areas, and should not be
restricted statewide.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, removal efforts remain localized and relatively small.
Most consist simply of volunteers and even schoolchildren yanking the
plants out of the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Ice plant pulls up relatively easily. Its runners can extend for
yards and yards, but are anchored only by shallow roots and one large
tap root at its base.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fun. I like it," said Larisa Stephan of Dune &amp; Prairie, a
Los Angeles-based group working to restore the El Segundo Dunes. "You
feel instant gratification. You can look at the square yards of
cleared ground and the huge mound of ice plant that is about to be
hauled away and feel that you really did something that day."</TE>

conviction, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Razo made headlines nationally in 1987 when he was arrested for
robbing 10 Orange County businesses. A jury convicted him two years
later of six of the crimes and sentenced him to more than 10 years in
prison.</TE>
<TE>   The case shocked the largely Latino community where Razo was
reared. After Razo's family moved to the United States, Razo became
an altar boy, a star athlete and scholar at Servite High School in
Anaheim and a leader in the local Boys Club.</TE>
<TE>   Offered many scholarships, Razo enrolled at Harvard in 1985.
There, he earned above-average grades and played linebacker on the
football team.</TE>
<TE>   He wrote a college paper expressing concern for Latinos in his
hometown who turned to crime and ended up in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Razo confessed to donning a ski mask and knocking off fast-food
outlets and grocery stores while in Orange County on school breaks
between December 1985 and June 1987.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews with The Times, Razo said he didn't fit in at
Harvard and turned to crime for the money. His take: about $25,000.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a homeboy now," Razo said after his arrest. "At Harvard, I
didn't fit.... I was confused."</TE>
<TE>   After serving seven years, he was arrested again in 1997 in a
domestic-violence case involving a girlfriend and was given
probation.</TE>
<TE>   He later was deported.</TE>
<TE>   Razo is being held in the Orange County Jail on a charge of
violating his probation and a no-bail Immigration and Naturalization
Service warrant.</TE>

<HD>Nails Are Found in Another O.C. Playground</HD>
<DH>Crime: The discovery at a Mission Viejo park is the third
involving sharp objects since Sunday. Detectives expand search for
suspects to hardware stores, and parents begin informal patrols.</DH>

<LD>Landscaping crews on Friday discovered 17 nails hidden around a park
in Mission Viejo, marking the third time in a week that sharp objects
have been found in south Orange County parks.</LD>
<LD>   Detectives began searching hardware stores and home-improvement
centers for signs of the culprit, who may be responsible for placing
dozens of razors and nails at parks in five cities over the last
year.</LD>
<LD>   The nails found in Mission Viejo appear similar to those
discovered Thursday at a Laguna Niguel park, where more than 50 nails
and razors were scattered around the playground.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities said the razors at the Laguna Niguel park appear to be
the same brand placed Sunday in the playground at Laguna Beach's Main
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   No one has been injured, but parents Friday began informal patrols
at parks, searching for sharp objects before allowing their children
to climb on the playground equipment or participate in youth sports.
The Orange County Sheriff's Department plans to continue sweeping
through hundreds of parks across south Orange County and has launched
surveillance operations in hopes of catching the perpetrator in the
act.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know for sure if [all the incidents] are connected or if
we have a copycat here," said Sheriff's Department spokesman Jim
Amormino.</TE>
<TE>   Employees of True Green Landscaping, a contractor that cleans
Mission Viejo parks, were raking wood chips at William M. Beebe Park
about 8:30 a.m. Friday when they found nails on the playground.</TE>
<TE>   The employees closed the park and called authorities. Sheriff's
deputies with metal detectors found more nails, bringing the total to
17.</TE>
<TE>   The construction nails, about 11/2 inches long, had been placed at
the end of a slide, on the stairway leading to the play area and
around swings at the park near Olympiad and Jeronimo roads, Amormino
said.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies had checked the park Thursday afternoon but found no
sharp objects.</TE>
<TE>   "We speculate that overnight, someone came and put those nails
here," Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   The first wave of razor findings occurred a year ago at six parks
in Costa Mesa and Newport Beach. Police never caught the culprit, and
the incidents ended in May 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Then, early Sunday morning, Laguna Beach police received an
anonymous call from a young woman warning that some friends were
going to do something at Main Beach to hurt people. Authorities
discovered 17 razor blades partially buried in the sand there.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, a father taking his 18-month-old daughter for a walk
at a small park in the Marina Hills community of Laguna Niguel found
razors and nails.</TE>
<TE>   Residents who live around William M. Beebe Park said that despite
their concerns, they think it's important to continue enjoying their
park.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Fahey, 33, of Mission Viejo doesn't want her 4-year-old
daughter, Kate, to be afraid of the park, but she said she's having
trouble explaining why anyone would place nails around the
playground.</TE>
<TE>   "Did he kill the park?" the girl asked.</TE>
<TE>   "No, they just put sharp nails in it," Fahey said. "They'll catch
him. Police are good at that."</TE>
<TE>   For others, the incident has shaken their sense of security.</TE>
<TE>   "I was shocked because we are in one of the safest communities,
and now we can't take our children to the park," resident Debbie
Richmond said.</TE>

<HD>Trial in Fatal Beating Ends in Hung Jury</HD>
<DH>Court: Ex-gang member was the last defendant in the case of
a Ventura man attacked outside his apartment. Prosecutors will
consider new trial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the jury hopelessly deadlocked, a Ventura County judge declared
a mistrial Friday in the trial of a former gang member accused of
participating in the September 1999 beating death of an 18-year-old
man attacked outside his Ventura apartment.</LD>
<LD>   Jurors deliberated for three days before indicating they could not
agree whether 22-year-old Ramiro Salgado was guilty of second-degree
murder for allegedly kicking and striking William Zara.</LD>
<LD>   "They sent out a note basically saying they were unable to reach a
decision," said defense attorney Richard Loftus, who said jurors
reached an impasse Thursday but gave themselves the night to sleep on
it. "Nothing changed."</LD>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Vincent J. O'Neill Jr. called the panel into
his courtroom late Friday morning and asked whether further
deliberations would be useful.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors indicated that they would not be and O'Neill declared a
mistrial.</TE>
<TE>   The panel had been hung 9 to 3, with the majority voting for
acquittal, lawyers said. The split had been the same for more than a
day, with the key issue being Salgado's admission to police that he
participated in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Gang members mistakenly thought Zara, a popular stagehand at the
Ventura Theater, had reported their noisy party to police. He was
stabbed and hit with a shovel and a baseball bat as he tried to crawl
away.</TE>
<TE>   According to court testimony, Salgado told detectives that he
kicked Zara twice in the back, stating: "I stomped him. I'll take the
blame for that."</TE>
<TE>   Loftus argued that detectives misled his client. Senior Deputy
Dist. Atty. Maeve Fox argued that Salgado's comments proved he was
guilty of aiding and abetting in the killing.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, jurors were uncomfortable with the statement and
questioned whether the defendant actually participated in the attack
or simply told detectives what he thought they wanted to hear, both
lawyers said.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked to them and they just thought the statement was too
ambiguous," Fox said. "They weren't able to confirm that he gave
enough detail."</TE>
<TE>   The lawyers said the jury disregarded the testimony of one of the
prosecution's key witnesses, a 25-year-old former gang member who
implicated Salgado after being charged with murder himself.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors must now decide whether to retry the case. A hearing
is set for May 21.</TE>
<TE>   "There could be some kind of negotiated settlement, or we could
sit down and try it all over again," said Loftus, whose client
remains jailed in lieu of $500,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   Salgado is the fifth and final defendant to stand trial in the
killing. Police arrested several suspects after the Sept. 25, 1999,
attack. Four were convicted of murder last year and are serving life
sentences.</TE>

<LD>After taking a double hit from the technology bust and the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, San Francisco International Airport saw a 15.7%
drop in traffic last year and fell from the fifth to 10th-busiest
nationwide, according to Geneva-based Airports Council International.</LD>
<LD>   International travel fell 6.4% despite the December 2000 opening
of the airport's $1-billion international terminal.</LD>
<LD>   Most of that overseas travel went to Los Angeles International
because airlines relied more on Southern California's larger
population to fill seats, said Tom Parsons, chief executive of the
online travel agency Bestfares.com.</LD>
<TE>   LAX maintained its third-place ranking nationally in traffic, but
still lost 8.3% of its passengers from 2000 to 2001.</TE>

of the killing has been arrested in Mexico and could be extradited
here next week.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge ruled Friday that a California medical marijuana
distributor has no constitutional right to dole out cannabis to the
sick.</LD>
<LD>   The decision was another blow to the Oakland Cannabis Buyers'
Cooperative. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last year that the group
had no right to sell marijuana under California's 1996 voter-approved
medical marijuana law, which requires the sick to have a doctor's
recommendation.</LD>
<LD>   The cooperative had sought to reopen the 5-year-old case under new
legal arguments, but U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer rejected
them at the government's urging.</LD>
<TE>   At the same time, Breyer declined to lift an order barring the
club from distributing cannabis.</TE>

<LD>The owners of a 100-pound pit bull that mauled an 11-year-old Pollock
Pines boy last month were charged Friday with failing to control a
mischievous animal, a felony.</LD>
<LD>   El Dorado County Dist. Atty. Gary Lacy said investigators
determined that the dog had been "terrorizing" residents in the
Pollock Pines neighborhood for several months before the April 20
attack on Brian Keates.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators interviewed more than 25 people before Lacy decided
to file the single felony counts against the dog's owners, Jillian
Michelle Figueroa and John James Rogers III.</LD>

<LD>The Los Angeles Unified School District has purchased a 14.4-acre
site for a new middle school in the severely crowded northeast San
Fernando Valley, district officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The new school is expected to accommodate 1,629 sixth-, seventh-
and eighth-graders in 67 classrooms and relieve crowding at Fulton
Middle School in Van Nuys and Sepulveda Middle School in North Hills,
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The $12.9-million property, the former site of the Van Nuys
Drive-In at Roscoe Boulevard and Noble Avenue, was purchased from
Jane and Bert Boeckmann, owners of the Galpin Ford dealership in
North Hills, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   About $2.5 million of the purchase price will be offset by
transferring ownership of the district's maintenance and operation
yard in the 8200 block of Orion Avenue to the Boeckmanns, officials
said. The yard, which served LAUSD Subdistrict C, will be relocated
to a site near Birmingham High School in Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   District officials first eyed the drive-in property as a potential
school site in October 1998 and began environmental studies, school
officials said. Before the studies were completed, however, the
Boeckmanns bought the site for $9.94 million in June 2000 in a deal
arranged by real estate developer and former mayoral candidate Steve
Soboroff.</TE>
<TE>   The seller, Circuit City Stores Inc., was represented by Soboroff,
who was chairman of the Proposition BB oversight committee on school
construction at the time. Soboroff has said that he first offered the
property to the district, but LAUSD officials wavered and only became
interested after the Boeckmanns bought the land.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles school board in March adopted a resolution of
necessity--a step short of taking the property by eminent domain--to
obtain the site, officials said. There are no buildings on the
property.</TE>

<HD>Judy Toll, 44; L.A. Comedian, Writer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Judy Toll, a comedian and writer whose life was an open book onstage,
making her a fixture at the popular and long-running Los Angeles
alternative comedy show Uncabaret, has died. She was 44.</LD>
<LD>   Toll died Thursday at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica of
complications from melanoma.</LD>
<LD>   As both a writer on such shows as the HBO comedy "Sex and the
City" and a comedian, Toll mined her personal life--the misbegotten
attempts at self-help revelation, the dating experiences that
invariably let her down--to create a running commentary on life as a
contemporary urban woman.</LD>
<TE>   In this, she embodied the attitude of Uncabaret, a comedy show
created in 1991 as a looser, more confessional alternative to the
mainstream (and male-dominated) stand-up clubs in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The show ran for years at Luna Park, a nightclub in West Hollywood
where regulars included Kathy Griffin, Julia Sweeney and "Sex and the
City" executive producer Michael Patrick King.</TE>
<TE>   Onstage, Toll told much, if not all, about her search for love
("My problem with men is that I have this deadly combination of being
desperate but picky," she joked). Her self-absorbed but
self-deprecating approach to comedy could be found in the title of
the television pilot she wrote last year for ABC, called "Me and My
Needs."</TE>
<TE>   After all the joking about the dating services, from It's Just
Lunch to J-Date, a Jewish Internet dating service, Toll last year
married Rick Trank, a documentary filmmaker.</TE>
<TE>   Toll also lampooned her failed attempts at self-actualization,
including a disastrous stint as a Scientologist. Toll would later
demand her money back from the Church of Scientology. When she got
it, she took her check to a Kinko's and blew it up to poster size,
then brought it onstage with her.</TE>
<TE>   "She just felt so free to be completely emotionally available,"
said Beth Lapides, who founded the Uncabaret, which is still running
around Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Toll, who was born in Philadelphia, got her start in comedy after
college in Massachusetts. As a member of the Los Angeles
improvisation and sketch comedy troupe the Groundlings, Toll and
fellow Groundling Wendy Goldman wrote the musical comedy "Casual
Sex," about two women at a Club Med-type resort, which was later
turned into a feature film.</TE>
<TE>   Toll's other credits as a performer include "Judy Toll: The Dice
Woman--Lips Only," a spoof of the raunchy, macho comedy of Andrew
Dice Clay, and the HBO comedy "Curb Your Enthusiasm," starring Larry
David. In recent years, she also wrote for numerous network sitcoms,
as well as the popular "Sex and the City."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to her husband, Toll is survived by her mother, Sandy;
a sister, Joanne; a brother, Gary; and two stepchildren, Josh and
Emma. Funeral services are private.</TE>

<HD>Park Agencies Squabble Over Wild Turkeys</HD>
<DH>Hunting: State plan to release the birds on public lands
draws wrath of U.S. as well as California officials, who fear damage
to ecosystem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HYMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the latest debate over which animals should live in the wilds of
California, the National Park Service is furious over a plan to
increase the state's population of nonnative wild turkeys.</LD>
<LD>   The state Department of Fish and Game is proposing to release
turkeys at six sites in the mountains of Northern California to give
hunters a better chance of bagging one of the giant birds on public
lands.</LD>
<LD>   But federal officials are worried that the birds will eventually
wander into six popular national parks--Yosemite, Sequoia and Kings
Canyon, Point Reyes, Lassen Volcanic and Redwoods--where they may
gobble up native plants and animals.</LD>
<TE>   In a recent letter to state Fish and Game officials, Yosemite
Supt. David Mihalic wrote: "We are all the more surprised at this
proposal considering the massive and growing body of scientific
evidence that shows nonnative species represent one of the greatest
threats to native ecosystems."</TE>
<TE>   Species Is Not a California Native</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the other national parks have registered similar
complaints, or plan to do so. California state parks officials also
oppose the proposal, claiming the turkeys would threaten "natural
biological diversity" at nine parks.</TE>
<TE>   Wild turkeys are the largest game bird in North America and are
common in many parts of the United States. But they aren't native to
California. Most of the state's turkeys are here because of a massive
stocking program initiated by state Fish and Game in 1959.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, there are now about 100,000 of the turkeys in
California, where they have been classified as a "resident game
bird." Many are on private land at low elevations, which stymies
hunters stalking the birds.</TE>
<TE>   The new proposal aims to increase populations at higher elevations
on U.S. Forest Service land where hunting is permitted. To do this,
the Department of Fish and Game plans to release up to 300 Merriam's
turkeys, a mountain species native to much of the Southwest but not
California.</TE>
<TE>   The 400,000-member National Wild Turkey Federation, a nonprofit
conservation and hunting group based in Edgefield, S.C., is the
proposal's main backer.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a case of some zealots in the federal government trying
to dictate to the state of California what they should and shouldn't
do outside the parks," said Charlie Ryan, a federation regional
director. "This is not turning feral pigs loose in the Garden of
Eden."</TE>
<TE>   The group also pays for half the salary of a biologist to run the
state's turkey hunting program--an arrangement not atypical in the
West, but one Fish and Game officials said they will soon end because
it gives the appearance of a conflict of interest.</TE>
<TE>   Only Lassen Volcanic National Park is near one of the planned
release sites, but park officials point out that earlier state turkey
releases have resulted in birds taking up residence in Yosemite,
Point Reyes and Sequoia.</TE>
<TE>   The big birds, known for their sharp instincts and myriad calls,
have also invaded state parks. At Cuyamaca Rancho, in the mountains
of eastern San Diego County, flocks of 15 to 20 birds are a common
sight. State park officials want them removed, but a trapping program
has had limited success.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem with this particular species of turkey is it's
something you really can't fix, once the genie is out of the bottle,"
said Yosemite chief Mihalic. "Part of the reason the American people
have set aside places such as Yosemite is because of their wild
values, and those values get compromised when you start putting other
species in there."</TE>
<TE>   The Park Service's mission is to protect natural wildlife
"unimpaired" for future generations, making the introduction of
nonnative species against agency policy.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Fish and Game concedes that no studies have been
done in California on the impact of Merriam's turkeys on other
species. Agency biologists believe turkeys, which eat mostly plants,
are largely a benign presence, as no serious environmental problems
have been linked to them.</TE>
<TE>   The National Park Service response: Get real. Park biologists said
one of the first lessons of ecology is that nothing's free--meaning,
for example, an acorn eaten by a turkey is an acorn denied to native
creatures.</TE>
<TE>   'The Birds Are Like a Big Vacuum'</TE>
<TE>   "Even the turkey experts will tell you the birds are like a big
vacuum, they'll Hoover up everything," said Natalie Gates, a wildlife
biologist at Point Reyes.</TE>
<TE>   Fish and Game wildlife biologist Scott Gardner, who wrote the
turkey release plan, said the disagreements stem from the dueling
missions of government agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "I think [the Park Service's] concerns are justified and we're
doing everything we can to accommodate those concerns," he said.
"It's difficult. We have to respect their policies, but we also have
our own policies, one of which is to provide hunting opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   It's a mission, some say, that has led to interesting
contradictions.</TE>
<TE>   As Fish and Game seeks public comment on its turkey plan through
the end of May, it's also involved in a years-long effort to
eradicate nonnative northern pike, illegally established in Lake
Davis in Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   Agency biologists fear that pike, a coveted game fish in the Great
Lakes region and Canada, will escape from the lake and wipe out
native salmon downstream.</TE>

<LD>The Oxnard Planning Commission has voted to delay consideration of
the RiverPark plan until its next meeting May 16.</LD>
<LD>   RiverPark, at the juncture of the Ventura Freeway and Pacific
Coast Highway, would be the largest mixed-use project in Ventura
County history. The mini-city would include residential units,
commercial and office space and three schools.</LD>

<HD>Teacher Denies Intimate Relationship With Boy</HD>
<DH>Crime: In a jailhouse interview, the 33-year-old says she
and her 15-year-old pupil had become close friends. She faces prison.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA HALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Tanya Joan Hadden says it all went bad, really, at Buffalo Bill's on
the California-Nevada border.</LD>
<LD>   It was outside the sprawling resort and casino that the San
Bernardino high school teacher recalled turning to her 15-year-old
pupil--some say, her lover--and asking: "Do we turn around? What do
we do here?"</LD>
<LD>   The boy insisted that they go on, Hadden said. And so they did. To
Las Vegas, where the 33-year-old teacher acknowledges she spent three
days of adventure and anxiety with a boy who had once been just
another student.</LD>
<TE>   The flaxen-haired teacher told her story Friday afternoon from
behind a smudged plexiglass divider at the Clark County Detention
Center, where she faces charges of kidnapping and "statutory sexual
seduction," which could land her in prison for years.</TE>
<TE>   Soft-spoken and fatigued, her blue nail polish peeling, Hadden
admitted a lot to a reporter: She had shown poor judgment and a
failure of "impulse control." Her feelings for a teenage boy had
gotten the best of her. And, yes, she loves Richard Pena, the bright
sophomore who first walked into her class last fall.</TE>
<TE>   What she would not admit, what she scoffed at, was what police,
prosecutors and television news reports were all saying--that she and
Pena were lovers and that she had broken the law by having sex with
the 5-foot-6, 145-pound boy.</TE>
<TE>   "That's so not what this is," Hadden said, exasperated.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the popular science teacher said, she and the boy had
grown over many months into friends, even soul mates--who shared a
love of punk rock and deep conversation. It was a sojourn that
carried them through phone calls and private meetings back home and
finally, this week, through a three-day odyssey in the desert.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think [it was] too much thinking with my heart," she said,
"and not my head."</TE>
<TE>   Still without a lawyer Friday because charges had not been filed
in Nevada, Hadden's 5-foot-2, 100-pound frame was lost in a navy blue
jail tunic and pants.</TE>
<TE>   She said her relationship with Pena began like with any other
pupil--for an hour in class each day.</TE>
<TE>   He earned an A last semester in Integrated Science at Cajon High
School, the same school she graduated from. The first-period class
had moved on this semester from physics to chemistry.</TE>
<TE>   At first, Hadden says, she would occasionally give Pena rides home
in her Thunderbird, listening to him talk about his life. Sometime in
the late winter, she began to talk about her own life and her
disintegrating marriage.</TE>
<TE>   They would meet at McDonald's for lunch, one of his favorites, but
she, a vegan, would just watch him eat.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very similar," Hadden said. "He said I'm like a female
version of him.... He has a dark sense of humor."</TE>
<TE>   Hadden said the boy rarely came to her home and they rarely talked
on the phone. Once, when they spoke, she said, his mother confronted
Richard about the conversation.</TE>
<TE>   Sometime around March, they were in a store when she suggested she
wanted Pena to call her by her first name. "He had called me Miss
Hadden when we were in public," she recalled. "And it sounded funky."</TE>
<TE>   Hadden, who has been a teacher for just two years, said she
admired Pena because he wasn't aggressive like many of the other
boys. She noted how many girls were attracted by his sensitivity and
muscular build.</TE>
<TE>   The trip to Las Vegas was as inadvertent as the blossoming
relationship, the teacher said.</TE>
<TE>   Both she and Pena had been questioned Monday by authorities, who
had gotten reports that the teacher was buying alcohol for minors.
Hadden, who acknowledged she bought beer for a friend of Pena's, was
told she might be charged with contributing to the delinquency of a
minor.</TE>
<TE>   "Richard kind of panicked," Hadden said, fearful about what his
parents might think. The boy reportedly called and asked his teacher
to pick him up at Cal State San Bernardino.</TE>
<TE>   Hadden said she only got on the freeway because she had switched
cars with her husband and was clumsy with the clutch. Once on the
freeway, she said, the two could drive and talk in peace. She just
wanted to calm Pena's jangled nerves.</TE>
<TE>   They drove for hours. At some point in the California desert, they
ran out of gas and had to wait for a tow truck with gas.</TE>
<TE>   "We kept driving and driving and talking, and then he'd be quiet
for a while," Hadden said. "I told him, 'Pretty soon we're going to
be in Nevada. We need to figure out what we're doing here.'"</TE>
<TE>   Pena wanted to go on to Las Vegas, where he had never been and to
put off any confrontation with his parents, Hadden said. And she went
along, even though she knew it was a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess it was harder for me to make him upset," she said, "than
to worry about the consequences of my actions."</TE>
<TE>   She said the teen was giddy when they arrived Monday night in Las
Vegas--rolling into the parking lot near the Luxor Hotel, its giant
pyramid looming over the landscape.</TE>
<TE>   They went on to the castle-like Excalibur, where they stayed for
the night, Hadden said. But she that night, and the two that
followed, she said, they slept in separate beds.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, they strolled through the Paris Hotel and on to the
Aladdin, where they ate and dawdled in the food court for hours.</TE>
<TE>   Hadden said she had wanted from the start for Pena to call his
parents. By Tuesday, in the parking lot of an outlet mall, they had a
huge fight. "I told him to get out of the car and call his mom." He
refused. "I said, 'Then I'll go call your mom.' He said, 'If you do,
when you come back out, I won't be here.'"</TE>
<TE>   Hadden said they both cried. Pena did not call home. Tired and
hungry, they went that night to eat at the Rio Casino Resort.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Pena checked in with a friend and the two found a
cheaper hotel off the Strip. "It was kind of seedy," she said.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, they went to a Wal-Mart, where Pena playfully picked
up an inflated plastic bat and pretended to stalk Hadden through the
aisles. At one point, she lost sight of him and felt a flash of
panic. She found him casually perusing merchandise in another aisle.</TE>
<TE>   But Hadden said she knew this journey was coming to an end. They
were wearing the same clothes for the third day in a row. They were
running low on cash. She had tried to avoid using credit cards,
knowing they could be traced.</TE>
<TE>   They checked into the New Frontier Hotel &amp; Gambling Hall Wednesday
and finally agreed they would return to California the next day. Pena
insisted he would stay with friends.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, they were preparing to go, Hadden said, when the
phone rang. "I picked up the phone, and whoever it was didn't say
anything," she recalled. "I said, 'They're here!' ... I knew we'd get
caught."</TE>
<TE>   Ten minutes later, a man was at their door demanding they open it.
She did, and found several hotel security people, one with his gun
drawn.</TE>
<TE>   Hadden said she knew from the time she left San Bernardino with
Pena that she would lose a lot. "I can't teach anymore," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But she considered it "outrageous" when she learned of the nine
counts police plan to level at her in Nevada. And that doesn't count
the allegations already filed in San Bernardino of child stealing and
performing a lewd act on a child. Those counts could bring five years
behind bars.</TE>
<TE>   Back in California, San Bernardino Deputy Dist. Atty. Verna Carey
was not buying suggestions that teacher and student were just friends
or soul mates. Several students at Cajon High School have said they
saw Hadden and Pena together, and "they were sexually touching and
kissing each other," Carey said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities cautioned against Hadden, or anyone else, making light
of the situation. "She took this child and she concealed him from his
parents," Carey said.</TE>
<TE>   Carey said previous cases have shown her that teenage boys are as
vulnerable as girls in such circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   Pena "is absolutely a victim here," the prosecutor said. "And it's
been my experience that the boy victims suffer just as many
consequences as the girls do."</TE>
<TE>   Late Thursday night, San Bernardino police officials escorted
Herman Pena, the boy's father, to the state line for a reunion. By
Friday, the family had returned to its modest home.</TE>
<TE>   Cars packed the driveway in front of the Pena home. A note posted
on the front door for the stream of reporters anxious to talk to the
Pena family read: "Please respect our privacy."</TE>
<TE>   Back in the Las Vegas jail, Hadden recalled last seeing Pena as he
was led out of the Frontier Hotel by security guards.</TE>
<TE>   "They took him outside the main door, and I could see them taking
him away," said Hadden, her voice breaking as she started to cry. "He
looked back at me."</TE>

<LD>Tennis-A column in Friday's sports section incorrectly stated that
representatives of John and Patrick McEnroe had filed a $45-million
lawsuit against Venus and Serena Williams over a proposed doubles match
between the famous tennis siblings. In fact, the suit was filed in Palm
Beach (Fla.) Circuit Court by Women's Sports Zone Inc., a company with
which the McEnroes have no affiliation, according to a representative of
John McEnroe.</LD>

from a story Friday about a Senate resolution supporting Israel.
Criticizing it as ill-timed, Sens. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) and Ernest F.
Hollings (D-S.C.) voted against the nonbinding measure, which was
approved, 94 to 2. California's two Democratic senators, Dianne Feinstein
and Barbara Boxer, voted for the resolution.</LD>
