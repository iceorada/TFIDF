<LD>What's in a name?</LD>
<LD>   Not only does your name give people something to call you, but it
can also tell who you are as a person. Are you funny, happy, tall or
smart? Do you like to read, play sports or hang out with your
friends?</LD>
<LD>   Here's an activity to show how you can describe who you are by
writing your name. Don't worry, you don't need to be a professional
artist to learn how to do it. You just need a little imagination.</LD>
<TE>   Step 1: Write your name on a piece of paper and look at it
closely.</TE>
<TE>   Step 2: Think about what you want people to know about you. How
would you describe your personality? What do you look like? What
kinds of things do you like to do?</TE>
<TE>   Step 3: Now experiment with the size, shape and placement of the
letters in your name. Try making the letters different from one
another. Add drawings or put a border around it. Design your name so
it shows the one thing that best describes you to others.</TE>
<TE>   Step 4: Show your new name to family and friends. Ask them if the
drawing describes you. You might surprise them. Maybe your name tells
something about you that they didn't know.</TE>
<TE>   Step 5: Make your name into a calling card. Write it this way all
the time or ask your parents to have a rubber stamp made from your
drawing. It can be your new signature.</TE>
<TE>   Now you know what's in a name -- you!</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If you enjoyed doing this activity and want to learn more ways of
expressing yourself, you might like to attend a five-week session at
the Art Center for Kids, open to all students in grades 4 through 8.

<DH>The story so far: Sarah's parents don't want her to go
against Amish ways by watching television, but Sarah is determined to
find out what it's all about.</DH>

<LD>Early the next morning I crept downstairs. I was hoping Mama would be
alone in the kitchen, but Papa was already there too. I took a deep
breath.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't go with you today after all," I said.</LD>
<LD>   "What do you mean by that?" Mama asked.</LD>
<TE>   "Well, I ... I promised Chelsea I'd help her with a report that
she's doing about us Amish. Like I told you, she has a lot of
questions."</TE>
<TE>   "Can't you do this another time, Sarah?" Papa asked. "Our family
should be together on a day like this."</TE>
<TE>   "I know, but ... uh ... the report is due on Monday, and she
doesn't understand anything at all about our way of life. She really
needs me," I added.</TE>
<TE>   Chelsea had told me yesterday that she was doing a report on the
Amish for her social studies class and that she needed more
information. Of course, she hadn't said when the report was due, but
at least the part about the questions was true.</TE>
<TE>   "Giving up something to help others is charitable," Papa said
slowly, "and it's always a good idea to explain our ways to others."
I knew my plan was working.</TE>
<TE>   But I held my breath when we went next door.</TE>
<TE>   "Chelsea's working on a report?" Mrs. Hewlitt asked, pushing a
strand of hair away from her face. "I'm sorry to say, Mrs. Bylar,
I've been so busy getting this place going that I haven't paid much
attention to the kids' schoolwork. But I know Sarah will be a big
help, and I appreciate her kindness."</TE>
<TE>   I stopped holding my breath. At last I was going to watch TV!</TE>
<TE>   I stood in the Hewlitts' yard and watched our buggy going away. I
felt an empty spot inside me, but I was too excited to worry about
it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Friday: Will watching television change how Sarah feels about
being Amish?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This story will be on The Times' Web site at www.latimes.com/kids.</TE>

<HD>This time's a charm for Mariah Carey</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shania Twain's "Up!" continues to top the nation's album sales chart,
but Mariah Carey's new "Charmbracelet" debuted third -- a respectable
start considering the woeful showing of her "Glitter" album last
year.</LD>
<LD>   Now in its third week at No. 1, "Up!" sold 317,000 copies last
week, bringing its total to 1.8 million. Carey's album sold 241,000
copies, less than the 323,000 debut of her 1999 CD, "Rainbow," but
better than the 116,000 for "Glitter." The latter's poor sales (less
than 600,000 in the U.S.) led EMI Group to pay the singer $30 million
to bail out of its contract with her this year. Island Def Jam then
signed Carey to a $20-million, three-album deal.</LD>

<LD>   Almodovar looks at love</LD>
<LD>   Men and the women they love are the focus of Spanish filmmaker
Pedro Almodovar's latest, "Talk to Her." We first see Benigno (Javier
Camara) and Marco (Dario Grandinetti) as strangers seated side by
side watching a Pina Bausch dance piece. A subtle bond is created
that carries through to the day they are reunited at a clinic where
they both care for women in their own way.</LD>
<TE>   "Talk to Her," rated R for nudity, sexual content and some
language, opens Friday in selected theaters.</TE>

<TE>   POP MUSIC</TE>
<TE>   Beat covers the bases</TE>
<TE>   The 10th annual KKBT-FM (100.3) the Beat Holiday Cooldown has a
lineup that canvasses the hip-hop nation. Veteran New Yorkers Gang
Starr, Chicago rapper Common, Philadelphia's the Roots, L.A.'s own
Talib Kweli and Jurassic 5, and Detroit's Slum Village share the
bill. For variety, the show also includes former Tony</TE>
<TE>   Toni Tone/Lucy Pearl singer-songwriter Raphael Saadiq, who prefers
the description "gospeldelic" over the "neo-soul" tag often applied
to his recent solo debut.</TE>
<TE>   The Beat Holiday Cooldown, Universal Amphitheatre, 100 Universal

<TE>   CULTURE</TE>
<TE>   Celebrating a saint</TE>
<TE>   The Virgin of Guadalupe has greatly influenced the religious and
cultural life of Mexicans and Mexican Americans. Mexican writer
Octavio Paz once said, "When Mexicans no longer believe in anything,
they will still hold fast to their belief in two things: the National
Lottery and the Virgin of Guadalupe." The Cathedral of Our Lady of
the Angels pays tribute to the patron saint of Mexico today with an
all-day Guadalupe Celebration in downtown L.A. Those unable to make
the 4:30 a.m. procession from St. Vibiana's Cathedral to Our Lady can
stop by the outdoor plaza where there will be music and dance
performances, a food fair and a second Mass at 7 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Guadalupe Celebration, Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, 555 W.
Temple St., downtown L.A. Procession from St. Vibiana's begins today
at 4:30 a.m., with Masses at 6 a.m. and 7 p.m. Free. (213) 680-5200.</TE>

language and its literature, theater, film and dance through
workshops, lectures, films, performances, concerts and classes.
Presented by the California Institute for Yiddish Culture and
Language Enrichment, the program begins Saturday and runs through
Dec. 21. If you don't have a week, Sunday's One-Day Yiddish
Experience offers a brief immersion with conversation, singing,
storytelling and humor.</TE>

<TE>   JAZZ</TE>
<TE>   One last go-round</TE>
<TE>   East meets West when the jazz fusion band Hiroshima performs at
the Japan America Theatre. The band's distinct combination of
Japanese elements -- June Kuramoto's classically flavored koto and
Johnny Mori's booming taiko drum -- and American pop, urban and jazz
sensibilities has been thrilling its fans for more than two decades.
But Sunday's show, which will feature selections from Hiroshima's
Christmas CD, "Spirit of the Season," will be Mori's final
performance with the band.</TE>
<TE>   Hiroshima, the Aratani/Japan America Theatre, 244 S. San Pedro

<TE>   ART</TE>
<TE>   Exploring the Blue spectrum</TE>
<TE>   Art collector, dealer and champion of modern art Galka Scheyer
(1889-1945) is best known as the founder of the Blue Four artists'
group, whose members were Lyonel Feininger, Paul Klee, Alexei
Jawlensky and Wassily Kandinsky. Through her contacts with the art
world in Europe and America, Scheyer acquired a remarkable collection
of paintings, sculpture and works on paper. "My Four Kings: Galka
Scheyer and the Blue Four," opening Friday at the Norton Simon
Museum, will feature more than 300 oil paintings, watercolors, prints
and drawings by the four artists as well as personal letters and
photographs.</TE>
<TE>   "My Four Kings: Galka Scheyer and the Blue Four," Norton Simon
Museum, 411 W. Colorado Blvd., Pasadena. Wednesdays-Mondays, noon-6
p.m.; Fridays, noon-9 p.m. Ends April 14. $6; seniors, $3; younger

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MUSIC</TE>
<TE>   Hail the 'Emperor'</TE>
<TE>   It is hard to find a major pianist who doesn't play Beethoven's
"Emperor" Concerto. But Pierre-Laurent Aimard -- famed, and rightly
so, for his Ligeti or Messiaen -- happens to like a turn at Beethoven
now and then. So sparks could fly when he joins forces with Esa-Pekka
Salonen, who knows something about new music and about Beethoven, for
the "Emperor." The Los Angeles Philharmonic program has a cheery
first half of excerpts from Mendelssohn's "A Midsummer Night's
Dream." Come early and hear Aimard in discussion with Alan Chapman at
the Upbeat Live! event an hour before the concert.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Philharmonic, Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, 135 N. Grand
Ave., L.A. Today, 8 p.m. $14 to $82. Also Saturday, 8 p.m.; Sunday,
2:30 p.m. (323) 850-2000.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DANCE</TE>
<TE>   Moves of memory</TE>
<TE>   Can dancing be a way to recapture history? Merging movement and
text, "War and Variations" offers evidence that it can. At Highways
Performance Space in Santa Monica, Dale Eunson, Simone Forti and
Terrence Luke Johnson create improvisational dance theater from their
childhood memories of World War II. Eunson traveled with her father,
a war correspondent. Forti was a refugee from fascist Italy. Johnson
grew up far from the war in the Midwest. Together they sustain the
belief that memories have a life of their own and that improvisation
is the best way to make them into vivid testimony.</TE>
<TE>   "War and Variations," Highways Performance Space, 1651 18th St.,
Santa Monica. tonight through Saturday, 8:30 p.m. $15. (310)
315-1459.</TE>

<TE>   Once again, the rogue</TE>
<TE>   Warren Schmidt has retired from his insurance job after 40 years
and his daughter is marrying a loser. So Warren hits the road in his
35-foot motor home, crossing Nebraska and bound for Denver, where he
decides the only thing to do is try to stop the wedding. In "About
Schmidt," Jack Nicholson adds another memorable, prickly character to
the rogues' gallery that is his curriculum vitae. "Election" director
Alexander Payne and co-writer Jim Taylor adapted Louis Begley's
novel.</TE>

<LD>   Romantic again</LD>
<LD>   Romance is what brought Michael Feinstein to the dance: the
Ohio-raised singer-pianist had his breakthrough in 1988 with a
one-man Broadway show called "Isn't It Romantic." He isn't changing
his tune for these seasonal concerts with the Pacific Symphony
Orchestra, which are billed as "Michael Feinstein's Holiday Romance."
Some comic diversions are promised, along with ruminations on love
culled from the Broadway and Hollywood songbooks.</LD>
<TE>   "Michael Feinstein's Holiday Romance," with the Pacific Symphony
Orchestra. Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center
Drive, Costa Mesa. Friday-Saturday, 8 p.m. $26-$80. (714) 755-5799.</TE>

<HD>Small-town Christmas</HD>
<DH>In Ferndale, the joys of the holiday season touch every
heart.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Duane Noriyuki</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The lingering trails of sweet perfumes swirl and laze, overlapping
like voices in a mall. The man at the Nordstrom piano, accompanied by
the constant hum of escalators, has a serious, faraway look in his
eyes and seems not to notice holiday shoppers shuffling and bustling
by. It's 71 degrees outside; the eastbound 10 is jammed. It's
Christmastime in the city.</LD>
<LD>   But far from SigAlerts and toy aisle mobs, far from stores where a
necktie costing $59.90 is considered "on sale," Christmas is
celebrated in small-town ways. That is what I think about as I listen
to the man at the black piano. I remember Guy, the chain-smoking bus
driver, mayor and Santa in the town where I grew up, the way his
white beard sagged as he handed us candy in brown paper bags when we
got off the bus.</LD>
<LD>   I think about the one-room school where I attended first grade and
how for the Christmas play I wore a towel on my head and a bathrobe,
for I was a shepherd -- a 6-year-old Buddhist shepherd. In small
towns, everyone is included, whether they want to be or not. I don't
think I felt out of place in the play, because I was with friends,
but I often feel out of place in the city.</LD>
<TE>   So does Jim Stanfield. He used to live in Whittier, but he's never
going back, not to stay, at least. Stanfield, 62, found his home nine
years ago when he moved to Ferndale, a Victorian village in Humboldt
County, four miles in from California's northern coast. It's dairy
country. It's also where last year, Stanfield found Santa Claus.
Stanfield stopped believing in Santa about the time he turned 7, but
in Ferndale, he started believing once again.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," he says, "I believe there is a real Santa Claus, a lot of
them. There should be more."</TE>
<TE>   One of Santa's elves in Ferndale is Ellie Green, who used to live
in Sherman Oaks. She's not planning to return either. The redwoods
speak to her in a way she can't describe. She paints, has an art
gallery, a harbor-blue 1957 Chevy, and a Victorian elf costume. Her
life is full.</TE>
<TE>   She sets out a Christmas tree on the sidewalk each year, as the
other merchants on this town's Main Street do. Schoolchildren make
ornaments and come around to decorate them. The trees line both sides
of Main Street, which dead ends at a Sitka spruce, about 120 feet
tall.</TE>
<TE>   The first Sunday each December, Tom Ford wakes up early and he and
son Greg drive in Tom's 1988 Ford pickup to the spruce, and begin
their annual climb to hang lights, which marks the start of the
holiday season in Ferndale.</TE>
<TE>   It takes a couple of hours, and after the Fords climb down, they
head to the firehouse, where retired volunteers have sausage and
eggs, hash browns and toast waiting for them. About 1,400 people live
in the area, and about 1,000 show up for punch and cookies and the
lighting of the tree, a tradition started in 1934.</TE>
<TE>   Some Ferndale folks say they don't catch the holiday spirit until
they hear the community choir sing. The tenors get a little wacky by
the time rehearsals end, says Betty Diehl, who has directed the choir
for all 33 years of its existence. But when the lights go down,
familiar faces and familiar voices radiate uncommon force and gentle
grace. It's enough to bring tears.</TE>
<TE>   "When we get together and sing," says Diehl, "it lifts us out of
ourselves." When the last song is sung at Sunday's final performance,
the audience will be asked to join in, and together they will hold,
like a shared memory, the final note of "Silent Night."</TE>
<TE>   "IT'S the culmination of all the rehearsals," says Diehl. "When
it's all over, I think we'll feel that we have delivered the message
we wanted to give." This year, their message is peace.</TE>
<TE>   That will be festively shattered Sunday night when the tractors
roll into town. They will roar, decorated with lights, down Main
Street for the traditional tractor parade. Afterward the drivers will
head to Mary Ann Bansen's place for holiday cheer. And the following
night, Bansen will usher carolers onto a flatbed, and drive them
around to sing for shut-ins.</TE>
<TE>   In Ferndale, no one is forgotten. For those having a rough go of
it, Ron Smith, head of the Community Chest, makes sure everyone has
plenty to eat. He turns no one down. If someone's husband gambled or
drank the money away, he doesn't pass judgment. He merely calls Jack
at the grocery store and sets up an account.</TE>
<TE>   Then, on Christmas Eve, families and friends gather. You might
smell Dungeness crab caught just off the coast at Green's house;
apple pie at the Bansens'. Then, heavenly peace and grand
anticipation give way to Christmas morn, when fireplaces are lighted
early and, throughout the valley, presents are opened.</TE>
<TE>   In case Santa missed anyone, a firetruck will be out delivering
more gifts. As the day is celebrated, in Ferndale and small dots on
the map everywhere, lasting memories, like the ones I cherish, will
be made, and, in all probability, there won't be a traffic jam or
$59.90 necktie anywhere in sight.</TE>

<HD>Gabriel has zeal but 'Up' lacks appeal</HD>
<DH>He aims high, with on-stage vigor, but can't rise above the
material.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Hilburn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Peter Gabriel is such a thoughtful and caring artist that his
concerts can feel as much like a missionary crusade as a traditional
pop tour. He's not interested in just entertaining us, but in
bringing us together -- individuals and cultures -- in a cleansing,
inspiring experience.</LD>
<LD>   With the underlying humanitarianism in his music and manner, his
performances could be held in a cathedral as easily as an arena.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, a cathedral setting might have helped him on Tuesday at
the Arrowhead Pond by bringing a fresh, distinctive edge to a concert
that seemed distant and stale for much of its 2 1/2 hours.</LD>
<TE>   Gabriel, who also was scheduled to perform Wednesday at Staples
Center, certainly tried to keep things lively, presenting himself as
a cross between a monk (with his short-cropped gray hair and solemn
black clothing) and a circus ringmaster.</TE>
<TE>   The English singer-songwriter and his four-piece band performed
theater-in-the-round style on a stage in the center of the Pond
floor. In addition to letting the rotating stage give, so everyone
got a close look at him, Gabriel moved around in all sorts of ways:
running, riding a bicycle, walking around upside-down (thanks to
straps attached to a ceiling rig).</TE>
<TE>   But none of the workouts quite made up for the stiff, lifeless
tone of much of Gabriel's latest album, "Up."</TE>
<TE>   Gabriel, 52, has been one of our most valuable artists for three
decades, someone who believes in music's power to help us through
moments of darkness and despair. He addressed those themes
brilliantly in "So," the 1986 album that was his creative equivalent
of U2's "The Joshua Tree."</TE>
<TE>   But "Up" is less inventive musically and less convincing
thematically. Little of it approaches the poetic grace of such
landmark tunes as "In Your Eyes" or the sheer emotional rush of the
joyfully nostalgic "Solsbury Hill."</TE>
<TE>   In "Darkness," one of several songs from the album performed
Tuesday, Gabriel speaks about crippling fears, then whispers, "It's
not the way it has to be." It's a lovely thought, but a bit too
obvious.</TE>
<TE>   Other songs tend to be vague or equally predictable. In "Sky
Blue," which he also performed, you know right away when he speaks
about "being so many miles away from home," that he's not talking
about subway stops but spiritual and social needs.</TE>
<TE>   There was a family feeling on stage that went beyond the fact that
Gabriel's daughter, Melanie, sang backing vocals. A warm host,
Gabriel introduced both support acts, the Blind Boys of Alabama
gospel group and Tanzanian musicians Hukwe and Charles Zawose. He
also brought them on stage during his set, with the latter duo adding
special vitality to a new number titled "Animal Nation."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the evening's most enchanting moment was at the end when
Gabriel, backed only by bassist Tony Levin, stepped away from the
grandeur of his social themes and flashy stage maneuvers to sing
"Father, Son," a recent song not on the "Up" album.</TE>
<TE>   The tune is about seeking a meaningful connection at the most
basic, family level, and his raspy, earnest vocal reached a personal
intensity that was lacking earlier. The moment was a reminder of the
depth of Gabriel's best work and offered a promise of better nights
(and albums) to come.</TE>

<LD>John Casablancas, the founder of top modeling agency Elite, has been
named in a sexual abuse lawsuit by a former model who claims that
more than 15 years ago, when she was 15, he impregnated her and
arranged for her to have an abortion.</LD>
<LD>   Casablancas, 60, whose agency has represented Cindy Crawford,
Linda Evangelista and Naomi Campbell, is accused of sexual abuse of a
minor. The civil lawsuit was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on
Monday. The plaintiff, whose name is not being made public, is
seeking unspecified damages.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Wolf, Casablancas' lawyer, called the allegations
fabricated and said, "I have no doubt they will be dismissed."</LD>
<TE>   Casablancas left Elite in 2000 to run the John Casablancas
Modeling &amp; Career Center in New York.</TE>

<HD>Women star in IFP film nominations</HD>
<DH>Films with taut female leads earn most nods for Independent
Spirit Awards.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lorenza Munoz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Films about women searching for meaning in their lives dominated the
top nominations for the 2003 IFP Independent Spirit Awards announced
Wednesday morning. "Lovely and Amazing," "Far From Heaven," and "The
Good Girl," each starring female leads in complex, emotional
performances, received the most nominations.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to those films, best picture nominees were "Secretary"
and "Tully."</LD>
<LD>   The nominees for best female lead are Jennifer Aniston for "The
Good Girl," Maggie Gyllenhaal for "Secretary," Catherine Keener for
"Lovely &amp; Amazing," Julianne Moore for "Far From Heaven," and Parker
Posey for "Personal Velocity."</LD>
<TE>   Best male lead contenders are Graham Greene for "Skins," Danny
Huston for "ivans xtc," Derek Luke for "Antwone Fisher," Jeremy
Renner for "Dahmer" and Campbell Scott for "Roger Dodger."</TE>
<TE>   Digitally shot films made inroads into the cinematography category
with three nominees compared with zero last year.</TE>
<TE>   Those passed over included Pedro Almodovar's "Talk to Her" in the
foreign film category; Denzel Washington for his first feature as
director, "Antwone Fisher"; director Miguel Arteta for "The Good
Girl," which otherwise received four nominations; and the biggest
independent hit of all time, "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," which
received only one nomination, for best debut performance for Nia
Vardalos. In addition, the critically acclaimed independent film
"Tadpole" -- picked up by Miramax at last year's Sundance Film
Festival -- did not receive any nominations. Once considered the
mainstay of independent film, Miramax received only one nomination
this year, for Charles Stone's "Paid in Full" for best first feature.</TE>
<TE>   Independent Feature Project L.A. executive director Dawn Hudson
acknowledged that some contenders had been overlooked, mainly because
of the way the selection process works. A committee of 14 industry
specialists watched more than 170 films over two months to determine
the nominations. The committee was selected by director/screenwriter
Bill Condon ("Gods and Monsters") and Hudson.</TE>
<TE>   "Because it is a jury process, not a balloting process, there is a
little bit of spreading the wealth in the nominations," said Hudson.</TE>
<TE>   The Independent Spirit Awards, which began as a lunchtime
gathering 18 years ago for a selective group of independent film
figures, has ballooned into a major event. This year's nominations
include:</TE>
<TE>   For best director, Joe Carnahan ("Narc"), Todd Haynes ("Far From
Heaven") Nicole Holofcener ("Lovely &amp; Amazing"), Bernard Rose ("ivans
xtc") and Gus Van Sant ("Gerry").</TE>
<TE>   Best screenplay, Mike White for "The Good Girl," Nicole Holofcener
for "Lovely &amp; Amazing," Dylan Kidd for "Roger Dodger," Jill Sprecher
and Karen Sprecher for "Thirteen Conversations About One Thing," and
Hilary Birmingham and Matt Drake for "Tully."</TE>
<TE>   For best debut performance, Bob Burrus for "Tully," America
Ferrera for "Real Women Have Curves," Raven Goodwin for "Lovely &amp;
Amazing," Artel Kayaru for "Dahmer" and Nia Vardalos for "My Big Fat
Greek Wedding."</TE>
<TE>   Foreign film nominees are Ireland's "Bloody Sunday," by director
Paul Greengrass; Canada's "The Fast Runner" (Atanarjuat) by Zacharias
Kunuk; France's "The Piano Teacher," by Michael Haneke; France's
"Time Out," by Laurent Cantet; and Mexico's "Y Tu Mama Tambien," by
Alfonso Cuaron.</TE>
<TE>   Documentary contenders are "Bowling for Columbine," "The
Cockettes," "Devil's Playground," "How to Draw a Bunny" and "Stevie."</TE>
<TE>   The ceremony will be held March 22 in a tent on the beach in Santa
Monica.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Faced with the prospect of launching three new dramas on the same
night, ABC has opted to move "The Practice" to 9 p.m. Mondays in late
January, replacing it on Sunday with a new version of the crime
series "Dragnet," starring Ed O'Neill.</LD>
<LD>   According to ABC, moving "The Practice" -- whose ratings have been
declining on Sundays -- will provide an established series leading
into the new drama "Miracles," about investigators of unexplained
phenomena. Another new show, "Veritas," is scheduled for 8 p.m.
Mondays.</LD>
<LD>   The changes take effect Jan. 27, in an effort to capitalize
promotionally on ABC's broadcast the day before of the Super Bowl,
traditionally the year's most-watched event.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In a blow to Paramount Classics, the board of governors of the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has ruled that the
acclaimed documentary-style drama "Bloody Sunday" is ineligible to
compete for the Academy Awards this year because the film aired on
Irish and British television.</LD>
<LD>   The single-night airing that coincided with the film's opening in
those countries violated academy rules that preclude for six months
the exhibition of any film outside the theatrical medium.</LD>
<LD>   Paramount Classics, the art house label of Paramount Pictures, had
sent a letter to academy President Frank Pierson requesting a waiver.
The board, meeting Tuesday night, denied the waiver after little
debate, an academy spokesman said.</LD>
<TE>   The movie re-creates the events surrounding a 1972 civil-rights
march in Derry, Northern Ireland, that left 13 civilian protesters
dead at the hands of British troops.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Directors of 18 leading museums in Europe and the United States,
including the J. Paul Getty Museum and the Los Angeles County Museum
of Art, have joined to assert their right to hold onto ancient art
treasures that Greece, Turkey and other nations claim as plundered
loot that should be returned.</LD>
<LD>   The "declaration on the importance and value of universal museums"
acknowledges that many masterpieces were seized in colonial times
"under conditions that are not comparable with current ones," and it
deems repatriation "an important issue" that museums must decide case
by case. But the directors contend that museums are a "valid and
valuable" repository for world treasures, and that whittling ancient
masterpieces from their collections would undermine their mission of
spreading knowledge and interpreting the past. Without museum
displays, the directors wrote, "The universal admiration for ancient
civilizations would not be so deeply established today...."</LD>
<LD>   Signers include the directors of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in
New York City, the Louvre in Paris, the Prado Museum in Madrid and
the State Hermitage Museum of St. Petersburg, Russia.</LD>

<HD>The night painter</HD>
<DH>Robert Olsen prowls a darkened L.A. to find what the
daylight world has missed. People are taking notice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Verini</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I once worked as a garbage-sifter for McDonald's," says Robert
Olsen, who now makes enough as a painter of careful urban still lifes
not to have to take such jobs. "Me and this other guy went around and
counted discarded straws and sugar packets and then reported the
numbers."</LD>
<LD>   A garbage-sifter? For a study? A consultancy? "Something like
that," he says, his mind moving elsewhere, as it will. When Olsen
offers such answers, they suffice.</LD>
<LD>   It is 1:30 a.m. and, as he drives down a deserted Beverly
Boulevard looking for a good mannequin, Olsen, bespectacled,
soft-spoken, scraggly bearded, dressed as a hip laboratory janitor in
his off hours might, muses on garbage-related matters. It is a
favorite topic of his. While a fine arts graduate student at UCLA,
Olsen, now 32, drew up a map of all the garbage cans on campus
(roughly 85) and, if you get him started, he'll gush about an
apartment complex in Santa Monica that boasts cans "four or five
times normal size -- trash cans on steroids."</LD>
<TE>   He hasn't painted a series of oversized cans yet, only a series of
Dumpsters. When he does, he might expand his purview to the north.
"They have great garbage cans in Winnipeg," Olsen says. This may be
the closest his voice comes to emotion, but when Olsen speaks almost
wistfully of the garbage cans in Canada, you feel an until-then
unknown urge to go to Canada.</TE>
<TE>   For the moment, however, Olsen, a native of nowhere in particular,
is absorbed in Los Angeles, in the city's noiseless anonymities: in
its empty bus shelters; its dented old Datsuns; its steel ATMs at
dusk; its tire boots; its parking meters; its Dumpsters.</TE>
<TE>   These are the forms Olsen sees; this is what he paints. He paints
them in the photo-realistic detail of a Phillip Pearlstein or Chuck
Close, in a sequestered, ghostly manner that sometimes calls to mind
De Chirico, sometimes Vermeer. He paints them over the course of
months, applying as many as 20 layers of paint to get the night air
just so, to end up with -- let's call them mundane cameos. Not
precious but indelible. What Olsen does could be described as
anti-action painting, or inanimate portraiture.</TE>
<TE>   In his own way, Olsen reveres Los Angeles. He does not let on, but
I know. He reveres its backwash, its blind, boundless regeneration.
Perhaps he envies the city its unthinking solitude -- or perhaps he
fears it. Either way, that is why I'm out here with him, in the
middle of the night. To see what's missed by day. To witness Los
Angeles through Olsen's patient eyes is to be introduced to the
lifeless citizens of the night, with him their proprietor. It is to
see the city through the eyes of someone who makes an empty bus
shelter an object of awe, who loves a lone orange boot on a tire.</TE>
<TE>   "This must be the '50s street," Olsen says as he drives down cold,
silent Wilshire Boulevard some time after 2 a.m. "A lot of Donna Reed
attire out here." Just at the moment the goal is mannequins. He's
fascinated by mannequins lately. "They have kind of a timeless
aspect," he says, hastening to add, "But I don't want them to look
too nostalgic."</TE>
<TE>   So he's looking for timeless but not nostalgic mannequins?
"Right," he says, "although I once painted an acoustic modem from
about 1987. I guess that was nostalgic."</TE>
<TE>   Most of Olsen's paintings are set at night, and those that aren't
may as well be. And it is at night that Olsen paints; but before he
paints, he drives. A few nights a week, starting around 1 a.m., he
leaves his small apartment in West L.A. in his nondescript blue
Saturn sedan ("I don't have a dream car") and navigates around for
hours on end. When he finds what he wants, he pulls out a discreet
little digital camera and furtively, without much fuss over
composition, takes a few shots.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes he drives until dawn. In the window of the Saks Fifth
Avenue men's store across the street, he sees a mannequin he likes.
He makes a U-turn and parks. "Look, this one has a navel," he
remarks, snapping a few pictures of it. He's right; it does.</TE>
<TE>   He walks a block to Saks' women's store, where the window contains
a distressingly severe finishing school tableau. One poor specimen in
a ball gown kneels against the wall, a book balanced on her head.
Another commits some imbecility on a chalkboard. "This one's probably
also used for gun displays," he says of a woman pointing her purse at
a companion. Olsen is interested in their fragmented, genderless
quality. "I stumbled across a Web site for a modeling agency that
handles transsexuals recently," he says. He'd like to photograph some
transsexual models. He may get in touch.</TE>
<TE>   "I need to come back here and learn how to tie a bow tie," he says
as we leave Saks. Olsen pulls out of his spot -- he is adamant about
finding legal parking spots even now, in these wee hours -- and
retraces Wilshire. He noticed a broken curbside the other day at the
corner of Highland Avenue that he wants to photograph. He's excited
about it. "It's a pretty spectacular broken curb." He still hasn't
seen any boots tonight; usually by this point he's shot at least one.</TE>
<TE>   He finds the curb in question and slows down, but notices two
police cars parked at the 7-Eleven across the street. "Uh-oh," he
says, and continues down Highland. He turns around, stops and waits
for the cops to leave. "I like as little hassle as possible," he
says. Would the Los Angeles Police Department hassle him for
photographing a curb? "You never know.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to isolate the ubiquitous, I guess," Olsen says as we wait.
"I like to look at these things as mathematical models. Failure
rates." He's fascinated with places that are meant for people but
where people don't fit. "Nobody's comfortable in bus shelters," he
says. "I've ridden the bus once in L.A. But when they're empty, they
have this amazing glow."</TE>
<TE>   Not antisocial, Olsen does like to limit his interaction with
people. "Just painting people, capturing the human condition or
something, I'm not so interested in," he says. This doesn't bother
the gallery owners championing Olsen's work or the art world, which
has begun, in its glacial way, to take notice. He's had solo and
group exhibitions here and in New York and Berlin. An ATM of his
appeared in Harper's magazine in May. He's been written up in these
pages, in the journals ART/TEXT and Art Issues. His work is not
selling for much, but it is selling briskly.</TE>
<TE>   As for the people selling and assessing it, one wonders whether
they've been out with Olsen at night. "He transforms them into
screens for emotional states of loneliness, abandonment and urban
anxiety," said Susanne Vielmetter, proprietor of Susanne Vielmetter
Los Angeles Projects on Wilshire Boulevard, where Olsen has shown
several times. Adam Ross, a curator, said he was attracted to
"qualities of loneliness and alienation in the work.... There is a
real sadness here."</TE>
<TE>   All of which may be true for them -- but they can't convince me it
is for Olsen. At this ungodly hour, looking for stuff most people
have forgotten exists, it's clear that he likes what he sees. He just
called a broken curbside "spectacular," a trash can "great."</TE>
<TE>   Most of his friends, many of them artists, agree. "He is a
recorder, a documenter," said friend Jodie Mohr. "If this gives you
any insight, he makes lists of things for us to talk about." A
classmate of his from UCLA, Paul Cherwick, said Olsen knows "pretty
much every detail about everything. If you pick up an object, he'll
probably know who invented it and what its patent number is. The
great flip side to his omniscient qualities is that he also likes to
get drunk and sing 'Chantilly Lace' at dive karaoke bars."</TE>
<TE>   At 2:30 a.m., the cops drive away, and Olsen pulls back up to the
corner of Highland and Wilshire. "It's like a shipwreck or an iceberg
painting, like a Casper David Friedrich," he says, delighted. His
satisfaction with the commonplace is infectious.</TE>
<TE>   Next it's off to Los Feliz, to the corner of Vermont Avenue and
Wilshire Boulevard, where there's a Metro station he's been meaning
to shoot. On the way we talk about his viewing habits. Does he
frequent the galleries? Quite a lot -- three or four times a week.
Museums? "I'll go to the Norton Simon, see how the old guys did it."
He is especially fond of Monet. Music? In a single breath he lists
Jerry Lee Lewis, Thelonious Monk, Glenn Gould's recordings of Bach,
Little Richard. Movies? Of course; this is L.A. But what movies?</TE>
<TE>   When he wants to relax, he'll go in for mindless action ("I like
that they don't try to be more than they are") or science fiction of
the 1960s and '70s. His favorite single piece of sci-fi is the "Star
Trek" episode in which Capt. Kirk fights the lizard-man Gorn. "Kirk's
doing all these rolls and flips, pre-T.J. Hooker." He'll occasionally
watch the lizard-man episode frame by frame.</TE>
<TE>   For a time, Olsen was into painting for size. He once did a series
of buckets that stretched across eight 4-by 6-foot canvases. His
scale has since zoomed in. Now his scenes transpire on custom-made
8-by-11 1/2-inch wood panels ("500 centimeters exactly"), in strict
adherence to classic ratios.</TE>
<TE>   We arrive at the Metro station at Vermont and Wilshire. It's
getting on 3 a.m., but Olsen doesn't appear tired; no more tired than
he usually appears, anyway. Still no boots. He kneels and takes a
low-angle shot of the elevator structure. The red and green glare of
the traffic lights bouncing off the mirrored steel pleases him.
"Shiny metal is dangerous to paint," he says. "It's too beautiful by
itself."</TE>
<TE>   While looking for more good angles, he tells a story. Like most of
his stories, this one is short. One night he was looking for a new
bus shelter -- one that had no advertisements on it yet and thus gave
off a perfect glow -- but couldn't find one. Just when he was about
to give up, a bunch of "scofflaws" emerged from the shadows, broke a
glass pane on a shelter and stole the poster. There was the glow he
wanted. He photographed it, unnoticed, and later painted out the
broken glass.</TE>
<TE>   Is Olsen trying to bestow order on a chaotic place with his
paintings? Is he trying to create the ideal bus shelter? "Something
like that," Olsen responds, shrugging. Would it make him happy if his
paintings inspired people to take better notice of their physical
environment? "To some degree. I wouldn't want people to romanticize
them," he says. Who would romanticize a bus shelter? "You never
know," he says.</TE>
<TE>   At 3:30 a.m., after shooting the Metro station, Olsen resolves to
get serious about the boot issue. Finding one has now become a matter
of pride, if such matters exist for Olsen. This means sticking to the
low-rent districts and the side streets. But first he must pay a
visit to some old friends. These friends are always parked on Hobart
Street, just south of Sunset, usually one behind the other.</TE>
<TE>   He turns onto Hobart, and there they are -- two matching yellow
Datsun Honeybees, circa 1976, that have shown up in his paintings now
and again. There they are, semper fi, looking like an old pair of
grandparents. He smiles. "I like to come back and check on them," he
says, "see their positions."</TE>
<TE>   Olsen's own parents, still married, live in Northern California.
His father recently had surgery for skin cancer; sitting on Olsen's
bookshelf at home is one of the rare portraits he's attempted: one of
his father from the neck up, with close detail of the biopsy site.
Like Olsen, his father studied art in college. But Vietnam was on,
and he joined the Army, ending up a career officer. This kept the
family moving: Northern California, Texas, the Midwest, Germany.
Olsen never spent more than two years or so in the same place. At the
risk of getting psychological, did that transience heavily inform
him, his work, even his choice to live in L.A.? "Could be," he
answers. Has his father been encouraging of Olsen's artistic career?
"I guess."</TE>
<TE>   We're back on Sunset. Suddenly, Olsen stops, throws the car into
reverse and, in a moment of wild illegality, parks in a red zone.
What has caused this bout of passion? "A nice little find": a Honda
with its back left corner crushed, as though it had been vacuumed
inward, as though by design. This is Olsen's kind of car accident. "I
like damaged cars," he says. When he lived in Sacramento, he recalls,
there was a ditch off a particularly hairy turn he would make sure to
inspect on Sunday mornings. It always had car parts, sometimes entire
cars, lying in it.</TE>
<TE>   It is approaching 4 a.m. and still no boots. The conversation,
which has turned back to the subject of L.A., has grown brooding.
Does Olsen like living here? "I think so," he says. "The boundaries
are somewhat arbitrary. You're always in the middle of the city no
matter where you're at. In New York, you run into people you know.
Here, you can go about your business and never see anybody if you
don't want to. If you go out of town for a month in L.A., maybe no
one will know." He pauses. "But these ongoing fixtures, I don't know
if I could find them anywhere else."</TE>
<TE>   What's done right in L.A.? What's done wrong? He answers in the
same breath. "It builds itself up without worrying about history," he
says. "It's not weighted down by 900 years of history. But there are
certain aspects of culture that should be slow, evolutionary, and
certain aspects that should be fast, changing by the generation. But
somehow everything here seems to change at the same rate -- way too
fast."</TE>
<TE>   At 4:30 a.m., just when it looks as though the hunt will have to
end without a trophy, here on this faceless tract of Venice
Boulevard, Olsen spots in his rearview mirror a black BMW with a
small, orange blur below. "I think that's one," he says. With all the
excitement you will ever see mustered in Robert Olsen, he makes a
U-turn, speeds back up Venice and pulls alongside the BMW. Yes, his
honed eye did not deceive. It is, indeed, a boot. A big, beautiful,
orange boot. And there's a legal space just a few cars ahead.
Perfect. Olsen parks, grabs his camera, gets out. He kneels close. A
flash of light. And then another. Robert Olsen is content -- or
absorbed anyway. Soon he can go home and paint.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Davy ROTHBART, as many already know, is a rescuer of all things lost,
an archivist of the abandoned. At Los Feliz's Skylight Books not long
ago, he gave an animated reading from a selection of fragments from
Found, his magazine filled with forgotten photos, misplaced letters,
torn diary entries and bits of disregarded shopping lists collected
by the 27-year-old writer.</LD>
<LD>   Drinking Olde English malt liquor and expounding on the magazine's
philosophy of finders, keepers, Rothbart -- who lives, works,
collects and publishes from his parents' home in Ann Arbor, Mich. --
is an utterly engaging performer. He shouts, swears, struts and hams
it up, reading from schoolgirl notes in a piercing whine and from
lost to-do lists in a deadpan monotone. Along the way, three
volunteers were enlisted to perform a found four-page play (which
happened to be missing Page 3) and several people in the crowd shared
their sidewalk discoveries.</LD>
<LD>   Accumulating new entries via his own diligent scavenging and that
of friends and readers (who send discoveries from all over the
country), Rothbart has managed to create a fascinating and
wonderfully moving collage of human emotion.</LD>
<TE>   "I hope that Found encourages people to pay a little bit more
attention to what's around them," he said, of the annual publication,
whose first issue came out in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "All you have to do is take that extra moment to pick up that
piece of paper floating down the street. A lot of times is will be
junk, but every once in a while, trust me, you'll find gold."</TE>
<TE>   Found is a kind of stranger's scrapbook -- a note from an angry
neighbor, an obscene love letter, the scrawl on an eighth-grader's
math quiz -- filled with the moments and memories of others.</TE>
<TE>   Still, as Rothbart puts it: "It's amazing to me, when I find these
things, to see how much alike we all are."</TE>

<LD>Making a mark in metal</LD>
<LD>   Pop-punk bands spring up in Orange County like tract homes, but
there is a hard-core metal act that is carving out its own piece of
real estate. A combination of searing guitars, in-your-face vocals
and neck-snapping explosions of melody, Atreyu winds up seven months
of touring with a performance Saturday night at the Showcase Theatre
in Corona. "I think we all have bags under our eyes, but the response
we've gotten ... it makes it all worthwhile," vocalist Alex Varkatzas
says, "especially the last couple of shows that we've headlined."
After the June release of its debut album, "Suicide Notes and
Butterfly Kisses," Atreyu toured coast to coast with Boy Sets Fire
and Snapcase, two label-mates on Chicago-based Victory Records. The
end-of-the-year dates put Atreyu in the spotlight, and the band plans
no letup in 2003.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   A real no-brainer</TE>
<TE>   Can't accuse Nick May of the garage rock outfit the Action Cats of
overselling the product. "This isn't smart indie rock at all," says
the band's frontman. "Just fun, fun, fun." Formed less than six
months ago, the band has been getting daily play on XM radio with its
distinctly So Cal-sounding songs, inspired more by Weezer and the
Kinks than the Stooges and New York Dolls. The band -- which recently
re-pressed its self-titled debut CD -- considers itself part of a
fledgling L.A. scene that includes melodic rockers Rooney and Warped
Tour veterans the Waking Hours. Can the Cats compare to any of the
breakthrough acts from New York or Detroit? "Honestly," May says, "I
think we have better songs than any of those other garage bands."
Decide for yourself at 7 p.m. Saturday when the band appears at Pug'z
Music in Westwood.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fast forward</TE>
<TE>   Hello, muscle-funk? The OC Supertones have edged away from their
trademark ska sound on their fifth album, "Hi-Fi Revival," but their
songs are no less catchy and their message remains focused on
spreading the word. After a handful of shows in January, the band
embarks with other Christian bands such as Relient K and Pillar on
the 3 1/2-month See Spot Rock Tour, scheduled to wind up in May at
the Bren Events Center at UC Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   It might not be quite the standing-room-only smile-fest that broke
out last month when his ex-Tories bandmates joined him, but Steve
Bertrand takes guitar in hand and spreads some more good feelings at
9 p.m. Saturday at Genghis Cohen.</TE>

<HD>In a window wonderland</HD>
<DH>Never mind the sidewalks of New York's Fifth Avenue. L.A.'s
occasionally naughty, mostly nice and abundantly creative holiday
displays are ready for their close-ups.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Julia Gaynor</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A majestic, life-sized white elephant has just burst onto the dance
floor of an Arabian nightclub wearing a silver sequined shawl,
taffeta ribbons dangling from its tusks. Giant disco balls and
confetti litter the floor. The beast's entrance has clearly startled
a mysteriously elegant woman dressed in brightly colored,
sari-inspired clothes -- very This Season. Her friend peers from
behind the arches of an ornately carved minaret, the backdrop of
midnight blue starry sky a perfect counterpoint to her equally
stunning attire.</LD>
<LD>   Although it looks as if it might be an elaborate film set, the
scene, dubbed "Comfort and Joy," is played out within the holiday
windows of Neiman Marcus in Beverly Hills. And the price of a ticket
is nothing more than a few minutes of time.</LD>
<LD>   Still, when you think of holiday windows, the image conjured up is
more likely to be of New York's Fifth Avenue, complete with a crush
of shoppers stopping to marvel at the intricate works of window art.</LD>
<TE>   We, by contrast, are a city of malls and sunshine, more often than
not on the run. Store windows are usually passed at about 30 mph. But
this is one season of the year when it's worth slowing down for
windows designed to be spectacular enough to lure us from our cars --
and beautiful and detailed enough so that once we get there, we won't
regret having stopped.</TE>
<TE>   A city of extremes, L.A. has two kinds of windows: lavish,
big-budget affairs found in Beverly Hills, and the more offbeat but
uniquely creative windows that smaller shops dream up. The windows
reflect the dual nature of a city that's both excessive and edgy,
using all of its resources and tapping all of its creativity.</TE>
<TE>   There are also two kinds of window watchers in this city:
transplants from colder climes, nostalgic for the holiday cheer that
only a well-dressed window can bring, and those who appreciate window
design as art. Window dressing is an old creative form, one in which
art and commerce intersect.</TE>
<TE>   Store windows are, of course, there to get people into the shops,
but as the king of window dressing, Simon Doonan of Barneys New York,
says: "Christmas windows are also street theater.</TE>
<TE>   "People in L.A. are now very sophisticated," he says. "You can't
serve them up dumbed-down versions of holiday windows. They expect to
see something punchy and fun, not just snowmen and reindeer."</TE>
<TE>   Doonan should know: The designer is well known for his
celebrity-themed windows, having featured Margaret Thatcher, Tammy
Faye Bakker, Dolly Parton and Madonna (three times).</TE>
<TE>   He tries not to box himself into Christmas cliches in his famous
Madison Avenue windows and, luckily, the Wilshire Boulevard branch of
Barneys offers up a slice of his over-the-top camp in a
Hollywood-inspired "Cher"-themed window this year. At the Manhattan
store, Cher takes up five giant windows, each paying homage to a
different incarnation of the icon, from the '60s to now. In Beverly
Hills, Doonan says, "all of the majesty of Cher is squeezed into one
window."</TE>
<TE>   2002 is Cher's debut as a holiday window. "I woke up one day and
thought, 'We've never done Cher.' What a horrible, glaring omission.
She's not just an icon. She's more like a deity. Everybody loves
Cher," Doonan says. He believes people "have an emotional connection
to her. Celebrities today can be so stingy. They never give us
anything. But Cher is magnanimous. We've always known when she was
having relationship problems, we've known about her coming to terms
with the fact that her daughter is gay. Cher shares."</TE>
<TE>   It's this sharing ethos that links the Cher window to the spirit
of the holidays -- a satirical, if not obvious, connection. While the
New York-based Doonan designed the Barneys windows, Philip Johnson
constructed the L.A. window, which is a high-camp explosion of all
things glitzy and glamorous and, of course, all things Cher.</TE>
<TE>   There are two Adel Rootstein mannequins cast from original 1970s
molds and dressed in Bob Mackie costumes created for Cher, including
a spectacular red glitter gown with a matching showgirl-style feather
headdress. Rootstein, a noted mannequin designer, revolutionized the
look of mannequins in the '60s. She was the first to sculpt
mannequins based on contemporary celebrities -- Twiggy, Patti Boyd
and Diane Brill, among others. Although Rootstein died in 1992, her
London company continues and her mannequins are still much sought
after.</TE>
<TE>   In the Beverly Hills shopping district on and around Wilshire,
there are many sumptuous windows to admire: Neiman Marcus and Saks
Fifth Avenue, of course, as well as the boutiques on Rodeo Drive with
looks designed for the area's high-end shoppers. The windows at Saks
are less over-the-top opulent than Neiman's "Arabian Nights" theme
next door, but they still have the luxurious and expensive
presentation that the upscale neighborhood demands -- albeit with
slightly more traditional holiday images.</TE>
<TE>   There's a twirling ballerina in one window a la "The Nutcracker,"
a rocking horse in another. The theme is "White Palace," designed to
evoke a Russian imperialist feel, according to a Saks publicist. The
windows do look cold, with an eerie greenish-gray hue, resembling
something darker than the romantic chill of a Russian winter's day.
The smaller windows on the store's Bedford Avenue side offer a more
cheerful winter scene: big white snowflakes decorated by children who
came to the store for a decorating party.</TE>
<TE>   Agent Provocateur, the Melrose Avenue lingerie store, has always
had a reputation for its attention-grabbing windows. Sexy with a
sense of humor, one of the holiday windows this year features a
lingerie-clad Rootstein mannequin driving a pink glitter sleigh; the
other has two scantily dressed mannequins pulling the sleigh. The
mannequins are modeled on Brill, the infamous 1980s nightclub diva.</TE>
<TE>   Store manager Alison Hay is responsible for the design of the
racy, tongue-in-cheek windows. This year she had help from L.A.-based
artist and former Hollywood set decorator Steven Sutphen. Of her
slightly risque display, she says, "I thought about having miniature
huskies pulling the sleigh, but mannequins seemed much more
interesting. Steven built the sleigh and painted it using a technique
of mixing glitter with paint and then applying several coats of
varnish, so it looks like glass."</TE>
<TE>   Hay says the Melrose windows need to make a bold statement because
of the car culture, and she notes that unlike in Agent Provocateur's
London shops, where the business originated, a particular piece of
lingerie placed in the window doesn't draw customers inside -- but
the overall effect of the windows does. "The windows convey the idea
behind the company -- it's gently naughty with a wry sense of humor."</TE>
<TE>   The Agent Provocateur windows change monthly and have developed a
following. "You can stand in the store and see people driving by
craning their necks or stopping dead in their tracks to have a look.
That's my reward," Hay says. You don't have to stand outside the
store for long to witness exactly that.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not an enormous company and we don't have thousands of
dollars, but I think that's better," she says. "With a smaller
budget, you have to be more creative."</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the holiday window with a message. Irene Muzzy has
been the heart and soul behind this kind of display at Uncle Jer's
Homestore in Silver Lake for more than a decade. She's a one-woman
window dressing team whose credo is always "ethnic but funky and
never traditional." Past windows have included "Turkish Disco
Christmas" -- Ali Baba with Turkish rugs and disco balls; "Icelandic
Houdini Christmas" -- for which a mannequin of Houdini was trapped
beneath ice in chains; and "East Indian Christmas," with an East
Indian princess and child replacing the traditional mother and child
figures. This year, it might have been a Frida Kahlo Christmas or a
Burka Christmas, but Punjabi Christmas won out in the end.</TE>
<TE>   As Muzzy explains, "It's centered around Ganesh, the first among
all Hindu gods. We wanted to go with a world peace theme, given the
times we're in, but Ganesh is appropriate since he represents
transformation in Hindu mythology and is the remover of obstacles and
bringer of good fortune."</TE>
<TE>   At the center of her colorful window display is a shrine to
Ganesh, complete with a papier-mache elephant's head, as well as
plenty of peacock feathers, which in India represent the third eye --
and, of course, the ubiquitous holiday window disco ball. "Ours is a
sort of disco Punjabi because I think of the '70s as a good time for
release, to dance and party, and that's kind of needed now."</TE>
<TE>   There are lots of pinks and greens, and the clothing chosen from
the shop has Indian influences -- saris, Indian prints, flowing
fabrics. In many ways, Uncle Jer's is a miniature, lower-budget
version of the Neiman Marcus windows. Not as grand but just as
satisfying in a funkier, if not as awe-inspiring, way.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Wasteland, the Melrose Avenue emporium of both high-
and low-end resale clothing, always has edgy windows and is a great
example of window design on a budget. This year, Janay Rose Growden,
who's designed the San Francisco branch of the store for years, drove
down from Oakland with her car stuffed full of mannequins and wooden
ponies to create "A Carousel of Seasons."</TE>
<TE>   This is the first Los Angeles assignment for Growden, who designs
windows primarily in San Francisco and the Berkeley area. Her only
direction from Wasteland's owners: "Make it like a party but not a
traditional Christmas window." She says she's often inspired by
songs, and this year it was Joni Mitchell's "The Circle Game" and the
lyrics -- "And the seasons they go round and round, and the painted
ponies go up and down." Then, a prop resource came through at just
the right time.</TE>
<TE>   "One of my junk guys happened to have all of these horses, so I
bedazzled them, painted them, gave them false eyelashes and jewels. I
wanted them to have the illusion of moving but couldn't motorize them
because they were too heavy and it would have been too expensive, so
I tilted them. I wanted it to be startling.</TE>
<TE>   "The most frustrating thing about doing the carousel windows was
thinking outside the square. The windows aren't round and the horses
aren't moving, but in window world, you can make it what you want. It
doesn't have to be literal."</TE>
<TE>   Holiday windows allow an artist's fantasies to run free inside a
glass box. You just may have to stop the car to appreciate it.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Last month and this, there's been a flurry of openings as
restaurateurs rush to fling open their doors before the end of the
year. A few weeks ago, a new place called Avenue moved into the
long-empty space on the corner of Dayton and Canon drives in Beverly
Hills -- the same address where the Italian import Bice floundered in
the '90s, as did several less memorable restaurants that followed.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe this one will stick around. It certainly looks the part.
Designer Dodd Mitchell (Sushi Roku, Katana, Linq) has ingeniously
restructured the room, transforming it into a glamorous supper club
that seats 60, with more seating on the patio.</LD>
<LD>   From the outside, Avenue looks dark and mysterious, and when you
walk through the door, it feels as if you're crashing a private
party. In the bar, the young Hollywood set lounges on suede ottomans
and leather banquets. Avenue is owned by venture
capitalists-entrepreneurs Darin Feinstein and Bevan Cooney, who have
been involved with El Dorado in Brentwood, Drake's in Venice and
Blueberry in Santa Monica.</LD>
<TE>   The dining tables follow the curve of the tall, two-story windows.
The night is closed off by astonishing suede drapes with enough
yardage to cover a circus tent. It's an incredibly sensual effect,
heightened by chocolate leather banquettes and seductive
suede-covered menus.</TE>
<TE>   The chef is Andrew DeGroot, who cooked at the French bistro Pastis
before he was lured over to Casa del Mar to become opening chef of
the Santa Monica hotel. His menu for Avenue is more or less American
comfort food with some exotic accents thrown in for effect.</TE>
<TE>   DeGroot is pulling out all the stops, and while the result has
been mixed, some of the ideas are interesting. For example, he
braises Manila clams in Viognier with chorizo, garlic and cilantro.
He makes a stuffed Japanese eggplant tart with Manchego cheese and
rosemary. Roasted free-range chicken comes with whipped parsnip
potato and roasted garlic jus, and a grilled pork chop is accompanied
by salsify and a macaroni gratin with apple wood-smoked bacon.</TE>
<TE>   Like many trendy restaurants, Avenue counts on its high-concept
design to create a buzz. Wouldn't it be sweet if the food turned out
to bring in people on its own?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<KH>My Favorite Weekend: Eduardo Sarabia</KH>

<LD>Twenty-two-year-old Eduardo Sarabia may not have a car, but that
doesn't stop him from getting around L.A. The recent Otis graduate
and native Angeleno, who favors public transportation and a silver
1964 Lambretta scooter to get around, is represented by the I-20
Gallery in New York and has his first West Coast solo exhibition
currently at the Santa Monica Museum of Art.</LD>
<LD>   Native son</LD>
<LD>   I grew up in Boyle Heights right near the Sears tower in the
projects. I like going back there. I really like the people. More
artists are looking for spaces down there. I'd love to have a studio
down there someday.</LD>
<TE>   My favorite Mexican food restaurant is called Ciro's. It's on
Evergreen just north of Cesar Chavez, across the street from El
Tepeyac. It's tiny. You could drive by and miss it. It looks like
someone's apartment from the outside. It has the best home cooking.</TE>
<TE>   I like going there for breakfast on Sundays -- their huevos
rancheros and chilaquiles are the best.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Is it April yet?</TE>
<TE>   When it's baseball season, I go to Dodger games. It was one of the
reasons I moved to Chinatown. Cheap rent and close to Dodger Stadium.
I walk up. It's just up the hill. It's the only exercise I get. I go
as often as I can. They have all these new family bargains so I
usually buy a pack of tickets. It used to drive my girlfriend crazy.
I was like, "I have to go!" She would bring a sweater to knit. I even
visit the Dodger store during off-season to buy gifts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In transit</TE>
<TE>   I really like riding the subway. I'm one of the few Angelenos that
doesn't have a car. I take advantage of public transportation. I take
the DASH over to Union Station for a quarter, and then take the
subway to the Hollywood Farmers Market or to Long Beach. I like to
walk around the aquarium or go to the beach and then come back. I
usually take books and read while I'm traveling. I have no intention
of getting a car. It's easy to borrow one.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ensenada</TE>
<TE>   When I have some extra money I'll rent a car and go down to
Ensenada. I have a cousin who lives there. I usually go and stay at a
hotel and go to the beach and walk around. Really mellow, simple. I
was just there. It's currently swordfish season, and we had the best
swordfish steaks and ceviche. Mexico's the best. I jump at the chance
to go anytime. That's what's great about living in L.A.: Mexico is
really close and the mountains are really close. In the winter, I
like to go snowboarding. I'll go to Snow Summit midweek and stay
overnight in Big Bear.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Museums</TE>
<TE>   The Huntington Library has really interesting stuff other than
just paintings. The gardens are really nice to walk around too. They
had this amazing show earlier this year about this guy who was in
prison during the Civil War ("Eye of the Storm: The Civil War
Drawings of Robert Knox Sneden") who made these prison drawings. He
had to hide the drawings in his jacket and then he'd sew a patch over
them so they wouldn't be taken away by the guards. They were the most
amazing drawings I'd ever seen.</TE>

<HD>Christmas fiestas</HD>
<DH>The culture of Mexico is wrapped into three festive events.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anne Valdespino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three annual Orange County events that revel in the holiday
traditions of Mexico are expected to draw thousands of Latinos and
others interested in exploring the Southland's rich multicultural
heritage.</LD>
<LD>   The programs have become increasingly popular for families looking
to learn more about seasonal celebrations in Mexico, particularly Las
Posadas, a reenactment of Mary and Joseph's journey to Bethlehem.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Ana's Bowers Museum hosts its annual Las Posadas procession
and fiesta Sunday; South Coast Repertory will stage its ninth "La
Posada Magica," in a spiffed-up version opening Friday in the new
Julianne Argyros Stage; and Nati Cano and Linda Ronstadt will appear
tonight in the ninth presentation of "Fiesta Navidad," a mariachi
concert at the Orange County Performing Arts Center that includes a
nod to Las Posadas.</LD>
<TE>   None are intended to displace the plethora of productions of "A
Christmas Carol" or annual presentations of "The Nutcracker" ballet,
organizers say. They just want to offer alternatives for Southern
Californians that hit a little closer to home.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a cultural tradition," says Genevieve Barrios-Southgate, the
Bowers Museum's community liaison who helps organize that facility's
event.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about audiences coming to support the work," says Diane
Rodriguez, director of "La Posada Magica," whose husband, Jose
Delgado, is a producer of "Fiesta Navidad." "When you see 'Posada
Magica,' it's hard to get a seat. And the mariachi show is in a
3,000-seat theater and it's still packed."</TE>
<TE>   At the Bowers, Las Posadas will take its traditional form. During
a candlelight procession, two children will handle the roles of Mary
and Joseph, and two groups of volunteers will sing. In the
time-honored ritual, one chorus outside the museum courtyard will ask
for shelter while another inside will refuse until the last
acceptance song, in which an innkeeper finally welcomes Mary and
Joseph inside.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, singers and onlookers can celebrate at a fiesta in the
courtyard. Dancers from Santa Ana's Fiesta Ballet Folklorico will
perform, and tamales, pan dulce (sweet bread) and champurrado (a hot
chocolate-porridge drink) will be available for $1 to $2 each.
Children will be invited to break a pinata and visit with a bilingual
Santa Claus.</TE>
<TE>   At South Coast Rep, Octavio Solis' "La Posada Magica" uses the
procession as a jumping-off point to tell the story of a little girl
who has lost her faith in humanity. The show points up the importance
of the extended family in Latino culture, says Rodriguez, but it also
has a universal theme.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about the importance of believing in your community: If you
participate in your neighborhood and take care of it, it will take
care of you," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Directing the show takes Rodriguez back to her days growing up in
San Juan Bautista in Northern California. Each year her community
would present miracle plays at their church.</TE>
<TE>   "They were amazing, with devils and angels and huge horses on
wheels that would have to enter the church through the back door,"
she says. Rehearsing for "Fiesta Navidad" also stirs childhood
memories for "Fiesta Navidad" director Cano, founder of Mariachi Los
Camperos de Nati Cano, which will accompany Ronstadt.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up in Jalisco," he says, "and I remember getting together
with family and friends, breaking the pinata, drinking atole [a hot
porridge drink], eating tamales and staying up all night."</TE>
<TE>   The concert will be staged with a Christmas-in-Mexico set,
folkloric dancers and a holiday sing-along. Cano notes that it's an
opportunity to hear mariachis away from a restaurant or cantina and a
perfect time to talk to children about the importance of traditional
music.</TE>

beauty of the mariachi and that we all have to preserve it, otherwise
we might lose it."</TE>

<LD>Big Love: Talk about big fat Greek weddings. In Charles L. Mee's
scintillating comedy "Big Love," 50 modern-day Greek brides are
slated for family-arranged mass matrimony with 50 of their American
cousins. But the young women rebel and flee to an Italian seaside
villa, where they ask for sanctuary. Mee transforms the musty source
material -- Aeschylus' "The Suppliant Women" -- into wildly funny
reflections on love, men, women and contemporary society that are
strewn throughout a woolly narrative that features music, dance, mass
murder and redemption.</LD>

<LD>"Griffith Park: It's Central to L.A." (Nov. 28) contained some
misinformation. Alas, the "Santa train" runs no more. Don Gustavson,
the proprietor, can no longer afford to keep the train running. Next
year he hopes to run the train as a nonprofit.</LD>
<LD>   The Griffith Park Train ride to the North Pole was enchanting. The
lure of boarding a train at night, crossing snow-covered meadows
(actually white cotton), talking to friendly elves and ending up on
Santa's knee brought together a mix of families from all over this
city. Next year I want to hear "All aboard. Next stop the North
Pole."</LD>

<HD>A Venice journey</HD>
<DH>Documentary captures the evolution of a unique seaside
town.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jessica Hundley</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WHEN tobacco mogul and real estate entrepreneur Abbott Kinney
purchased a swath of swampland on the Southern California coast in
the early 1900s, he was looking to build a world that sprang directly
from his own colorful imagination. Kinney's Venice would be a New
Italy by the sea, a canal-crisscrossed cultural center with the added
flash of American glitz, a romantic vision of upper-class European
decadence democratized for the new U.S. working middle class. The
result of his vision was a resort-town utopia replete with gondolas,
palazzos, an amusement pier and a meandering miniature railway.</LD>
<LD>   Early Venice Beach was host to thousands of tourists from around
the world and became a favorite location for the burgeoning film
industry. Eventually Kinney's vision included year-round residents,
with displaced Midwesterners and East Coast expatriates making his
dream into their home.</LD>
<LD>   Over the years the town evolved and what Venice once was and what
it became is in many ways a direct reflection of the past century's
turmoil and the burden of rapid urban expansion. In his first film,
"Venice: Lost and Found," documentarian Brad Bemis attempts to
capture the strange evolution of this one-of-a-kind community.</LD>
<TE>   "I knew I wanted to do a documentary and it just seemed right that
I do it on my own town," explains Bemis from his home in Venice. "I
live here and I love it and it seemed like such a rich topic. And the
more I researched, the more interesting it became."</TE>
<TE>   A resident of the area for the past 12 years, Bemis initially was
inspired by his desire to find a creative alternative to his harried
career as a location manager. "I was working on really unsatisfying
stuff at the time," says Bemis, "I was helping sell dog food and
potato chips and that sort of thing" in TV commercials. "I decided it
was time I did something I liked and hopefully other people would end
up liking it as well."</TE>
<TE>   For "Lost and Found" Bemis delved deep into the area's past,
mining archival photos and films, soliciting interviews and logging
more than 60 hours of video footage.</TE>
<TE>   "There were so many issues, so many artists, you could film in
Venice forever and still not cover everything," says the filmmaker. "
It's that vibrant and diverse a community. ... the gang violence, the
gentrification, the fight for affordable housing. I know the film
inevitably leaves the viewers wanting more, but I think that's a good
thing."</TE>
<TE>   Bemis managed to condense a century's worth of history into one
jam-packed hour. The film's narrative moves from the town's early
notoriety as an amusement metropolis to its eventual inception as
artist bohemia, establishing a tradition of self-expression that
still resonates today.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sort of an anthropological look at the history of community
and where it came from and where it's going," explains Bemis. "It
began as an amusement village and you can still feel that in the
creative freedom here, and that bleeds into the atmosphere. You can
sense it in the city."</TE>
<TE>   Bemis enlisted an impressive cross-section of Venice's diverse
population to participate in the project, and the film's interview
segments include everything from labyrinthine diatribes by boardwalk
denizens to deconstructions from city historians, to colorful
memories from celebrities who have made the area their home.</TE>
<TE>   Dancer Gregory Hines shares his Venice recollections,
actor-director Dennis Hopper waxes poetic on the early days of the
town's art scene and Doors keyboardist Ray Manzarek gives an animated
tour of the area's '60s psychedelic highlights.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to try to make something positive about the community,"
says Bemis. "So I tracked down people I thought would be interesting
and who were a big part of the community."</TE>
<TE>   It's Bemis' own connection with the area that may prove the most
poignant. His passion resulted in a die-hard commitment and a
stubborn persistence that fueled the project through five years of
production.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to make a film which reflected why I like Venice,"
explains Bemis, who grew up in Lakewood. "I like the artistic flavor,
I like the architecture and I like the funky walking streets and the
little bungalows. I wanted the water, too.... It's an amazing place."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Bemis' "city," which was deeded to Los Angeles in the '40s,
is changing quickly. "I wanted to capture it before the
gentrification got out of control," says Bemis, "The real-estate
prices are already skyrocketing, the rich are moving in and I wanted
to try to show the way it is now because there's no telling what will
happen in the next few years."</TE>

<DH>At CineSpace, patrons can expect upscale dishes and some
eclectic film offerings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maria Elena Fernandez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was no movie playing at the long-awaited opening of CineSpace,
but that didn't stop the supper club's introductory bash from
carrying all of the hype of a blockbuster movie premiere. A red
carpet on Hollywood Boulevard welcomed B-list celebrities including
Shannon Elizabeth, James Wilder and Tatiana Ali to the party Thursday
night that attracted more than 1,000 celebrants, who lined Ivar
Avenue for their chance to be seen inside.</LD>
<LD>   When CineSpace opens its doors to the public on Jan. 3, it
promises to be a movie lover's dream, an upscale restaurant, bar and
screening room where diners can enjoy contemporary American cuisine
and sip cocktails while watching independent art-house films,
classics, music videos and video art.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, it was sheer Hollywood nightclub glitz -- that is,
until the twin trees came out. About 90 minutes into the party, two
evergreen and very tall vines on stilts slowly made their way around
the 8,300-square-foot club, interacting with each other and morphing
into and out of elegant shapes.</LD>
<TE>   "It's very freaky," said Jennifer Thompson of Studio City who kept
spilling the two cosmopolitans she was holding in her efforts to
elude one particularly pushy vine. The vines, as it turned out, were
not trying to scare anybody. The cramped surroundings made it tough
for Vine to Vine, two performance artists from Orlando, to slowly
animate and reveal themselves to the happening and Hollywood set.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not trying to intimidate anyone," said Priscilla Blight,
president of Second Nature Productions, which has been producing the
living garden show for six years. "It was just so busy in there."</TE>
<TE>   So busy that CineSpace co-owner Kimberly Herrmann had little time
to notice the vine act's effect on her crowd or the abstract video
paintings by C2 in the main dining room.</TE>
<TE>   "This is basically three years of my life right here," said
Herrmann, 31, surveying the room's unfinished design elements. "And
it's not even halfway done. But I'm thrilled that people are finally
getting a chance to see it. This is like a wedding. I've never had
all of the people in my life in one room like this."</TE>
<TE>   Herrmann, a former MTV producer who earned an MBA from San
Francisco State University, and her boyfriend, Errol Roussel, who got
his MBA at Pepperdine University, have been planning their business
venture since they graduated four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We both had that entrepreneurial spirit and we started a small
concierge business, but that wasn't a good fit for us," said Roussel,
34. "Then one day over dinner, we just started thinking and came up
with this."</TE>
<TE>   Although there are other restaurants around the nation where
diners can watch movies -- Foreign Cinema in San Francisco, Cinema
Grill in Atlanta, and Screening Room in New York -- in those spots
the films are more background scenery or shown in a separate room.
CineSpace is attempting to blend the two experiences, offering
upscale dining but keeping the focus on the movie. It will also
provide a lounge for art and photo exhibitions, fashion shows and DJ
showcases. Executive chef Monica May, formerly of North, hopes to
dazzle with her lobster pot pie, pan-fried buttermilk chicken and
country-style meatloaf.</TE>
<TE>   "We really want to be regarded as a community place and open space
for all kinds of artistry," said co-owner David Dickerson, 32. "There
isn't any area we won't delve into." As the director of programming,
Dickerson -- a lifelong student of cinema with a bachelor's degree in
TV and film from the University of Maryland -- is the man behind the
curtain. He envisions CineSpace as a relaxing spot for movie lovers
as well as a meeting place for industry executives.</TE>
<TE>   CineSpace opens to the public with a documentary, "American Pimp."
Herrmann has plans for a Sunday family movie night, an afternoon for
moms and children on Mondays, and a monthly Francis Ford Coppola
night in which Coppola wines and Italian fare will accompany one of
the director's classics.</TE>
<TE>   On the second floor of a restored historic building, Cine- Space's
original brick walls have been exposed to create an urban, modern
look.</TE>
<TE>   The 1922 Churrigueresque-style retail building originally housed
Schwab's Men's Haberdashery. The popular nightclub, Ivar, is now on
the first floor.</TE>
<TE>   "This is pretty swanky, cool and crazy," said Diora McKelvy, a
30-year-old nurse who lives in San Diego. "They've got a little more
work to do on it, but it's a great concept and great people are
behind it."</TE>

<HD>A peek preview of the Lotus</HD>

<LD>The two white canopy tents in Hollywood shoot up to the sky, creating
a new landmark that can be seen from blocks away on Hollywood
Boulevard, Cahuenga Boulevard and even the Hollywood Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   Beneath the spectacular awnings is White Lotus, the Euro-Asian
supper club designed and owned by Sunset Room trio Chris Breed, Alan
Hajjar and Eric James. A 12,000-square-foot restaurant and dance club
designed with feng shui calming harmony, White Lotus will open in
mid-January. But the partners gave in to the positive karma of their
large Buddha statue and let Step Up Women's Network -- an L.A.-based
nonprofit organization that promotes philanthropy among women --
throw its huge holiday party and benefit there Friday. We joined them
for a sneak peek.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 1,000 donors, including Laura Elena Harring, Erik
Palladino, James Van Der Beek and Michelle Rodriguez, partied at the
elegant and cavernous space formerly known as the Crush Bar. Breed,
Hajjar and James were warm but weary, having worked around the clock
with construction crews to make the party's deadline.</LD>
<TE>   "We gave it our best shot," James said. "I'm very tired but happy
we did it."</TE>
<TE>   Breed, who designed the Sunset Room and Pig 'n Whistle, studied
Asian cultures to create the look. Eight soldier statues guard the
entrance, where a hostess will greet guests. Throughout are antique
design elements, like 200-year-old Chinese panels and two Korean
teapots from the 5th century.</TE>
<TE>   Diners will be able to choose from a dim sum or full menu as they
share a canopy tent with the stunning Buddha in his white lotus pond.
Or they can go inside to a sushi bar.</TE>
<TE>   A spacious dance floor is surrounded by a VIP room and three
smaller private lounges. The main bar is purple and lighted by
Asian-style lanterns; smokers have a sky-lit patio.</TE>
<TE>   And the name? "The white lotus comes from the bottom of the river
and comes up to be the purest of flowers," said Breed. After Crush
Bar's time in this space, Breed added, "it really needed something to
purify it."</TE>

<HD>Apples recipe: Stir it up well</HD>
<DH>On a new CD, the quirky indie band abandons its pop comfort
zone for rock.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Natalie Nichols</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Quirky indie group the Apples in Stereo spent nine years charming
critics and fans with carefully honed albums of orchestral pop that
evoked such '60s heroes as the Beatles, the Beach Boys and Pink
Floyd.</LD>
<LD>   But for Apples leader Robert Schneider, familiarity with those
influences was breeding, if not contempt, definitely boredom.</LD>
<LD>   "Being in a comfort zone is a really nice thing," says the
singer-guitarist-producer, 31.</LD>
<TE>   "At the same time, once you're comfortable, you lose some sort of
ambition."</TE>
<TE>   So, the Denver-based quartet, which also includes guitarist John
Hill, bassist Eric Allen and drummer Hilarie Sidney (Schneider's
wife), decided to strip things down for its current album, "Velocity
of Sound."</TE>
<TE>   The new collection, released in October by New York City-based
spinART Records, is more Joey Ramone than Brian Wilson, with 11
tracks that clock in at a mere 28 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "Velocity" arrives at a time when listeners' ears are attuned to
the more streamlined and high-octane rock pleasures of the White
Stripes, the Strokes, the Hives, et al. Indeed, the album's
super-simplistic songs have a childlike charm akin to those of White
Stripes songwriter Jack White.</TE>
<TE>   Schneider, who describes himself as "really hyper" and "a little
spastic" and who speaks in rushed-yet-coherent sentences that stumble
over one another, says the shift was strictly the result of his
hankering for a change.</TE>
<TE>   He usually has several interconnected projects going on at once.
He's working on his second solo collection, under the moniker the
Marbles, and is collaborating on an album with one of his heroes,
Andy Partridge of veteran British pop group XTC, which probably will
be released next year.</TE>
<TE>   But Schneider has been making the same kind of music since high
school. In college he co-launched the Elephant 6 Recording Collective
of groups including Neutral Milk Hotel, Olivia Tremor Control and
Secret Square, which shared members as well as a creative emphasis on
whimsy and psychedelia.</TE>
<TE>   "I just kind of felt burned out on being sophisticated, on being
pretentious, on trying to evoke the sort of surrealist feeling of our
[previous] records," says Schneider, a South African native who was
raised in Ruston, La.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything that I've ever produced has been psychedelic. It was a
real challenge to make a really direct, quick rock 'n' roll record."</TE>
<TE>   "Velocity" also let the group resolve something of a sonic split
personality.</TE>
<TE>   "Live, we're a really, really loud kind of fuzz-rock band, and we
always have been," Schneider says.</TE>
<TE>   "But on our records, we always took the approach of trying to make
these deep, interesting, very colorful productions. Our new record
[is] closer to what we sound like as a [live] band."</TE>
<TE>   Schneider's impulse to shake things up came at a good time, and
not because the album's au courant sound perhaps has more commercial
potential than previous works. It's more that his life ended up
paralleling the band's creative shift.</TE>
<TE>   He and Sidney recently moved from their longtime Denver digs to
her home state of Kentucky, where they could more affordably raise
their young son, Max, as well as continue their career, thanks to a
recording studio in their garage.</TE>
<TE>   The Apples narrowly avoided a less welcome shakeup last month,
when its first-ever European tour was nearly derailed just as it
began.</TE>
<TE>   Upon arrival in Brussels, Schneider discovered that no one on the
Apples support team had secured him a visa to enter Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "I ended up being detained by the immigration police," he says.
"They were very, very nice." Still, he had to travel to England to
arrange a visa, which he managed, after much scrambling, with the
help of officials at the Norwegian embassy.</TE>
<TE>   "Rocking in the face of adversity is one of our mottos," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "And, after that, we had an incredible tour. The shows were sold
out, and people were pumping fists and crowd-surfing. It felt like we
were Led Zeppelin or something."</TE>

<LD>How to Lose Friends  and Alienate People</LD>
<LD>   By Toby Young</LD>
<LD>   Da Capo Press (July 2002)</LD>
<TE>   I just finished reading it -- how trashy and yet literary it was.
It made me laugh, and I loved the insider/outsider view of Vanity
Fair magazine, the struggle between creativity and commercialism. I
always love a fish-out-of-water story, or in this case a Brit out of
water.</TE>

<LD>What to expect</LD>
<LD>   The thing is, you never really know what to expect at the Pomona
Arts Colony.</LD>
<LD>   It's not unusual to see teenagers with spiked hair and black
leather waiting to get into the Glass House, a punk and alternative
rock club, while a jazz trio performs on the sidewalk and diners at
Joey's BBQ wipe their chops to the sound of country music. Meanwhile,
Chardonnay is being sipped at an opening at the Cuttress Gallery,
soccer moms are learning glass-blowing at Moon Maiden Glass, and
Wiccans are browsing at the Crystal Cauldron.</LD>
<TE>   The second or fourth Saturday evening of each month is the best
time to visit. The Second Saturday ArtWalk, from 6 to 10 p.m.,
features receptions at many of the galleries, while the fourth
Saturday, known as Passport to Pomona, runs 7 to 10 p.m. and includes
entertainment on stages set up throughout the area.</TE>
<TE>   This week's festivities will include the 5iftybucks Gallery
celebration of Quema del Diablo on Saturday, with art and music
designed to rid Pomona of "devil spirits'' in time for Christmas and
the New Year. The art show will include more than 100 artists, among
them Michael Meyka, whose work will be projected against the outside
wall of a building in the colony.</TE>
<TE>   Also participating in the Saturday events are specialty retail
shops, restaurants, clubs and more than a dozen galleries, including
Art on Fence, where a college student occasionally hangs pieces on a
chain-link fence along 2nd Street. Artists living in the lofts
sometimes open their homes to the public to show work.</TE>
<TE>   Latino art and cultural offerings are available throughout the
colony at venues such as the Latino Art Museum, California Art
Gallery; Magulandia Studio, Chicano Art &amp; Design; Galeria Rustica,
Latino/Cultural Art; and Cafe con Libros, which hosts authors Jane
Tonorio-Coscarelli and Michael Heralda as part of a tamal celebration
from 5 to 8 p.m. Saturday. Beyond the music and art, the area boasts
an antique row across Garey Avenue at 2nd Street, with a two-block
stretch that holds six antique malls and 15 individual stores. The
eclecticism carries through in such restaurants as El Taco Nazo, New
York Delight and Chung King Restaurant to a live entertainment scene
that has room for Yesteryear's blues and oldies club as well as the
more cutting-edge slant at the Glass House. The Web site
www.downtownpomona.com/artcolony.htm contains more details on
individual artists, galleries and businesses in the area.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The past</TE>
<TE>   The downtown area suffered a decline in the 1960s, as businesses
closed and employers left town. Buildings were boarded up, and the
area became, for the most part, a modern-day ghost town. One night,
Edward Tessier was practicing with his band in a downtown building,
and some of the ghosts emerged, drawn to the music. They were
artists. In the 1990s, Tessier, a developer noticed that artists were
gravitating to the area on their own and began to wonder what might
happen if they were encouraged to do so. He helped open a coffee
shop, began developing artists' lofts and recruiting arts
organizations and galleries.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The future</TE>
<TE>   While much of the work at the galleries is that of emerging
artists, better-known artists also are being featured occasionally.
Next year, Judy Chicago will be staying at the colony to lead a
project on "Addressing the Future." In 2003, the colony will become
the campus for a charter high school for the arts. More lofts are
being built.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Artists</TE>
<TE>   About 200 artists live in the colony. Among the more well-known:
Gilbert Sanchez Lujan, known as "Magu," considered a pioneer in the
Chicano art movement; painter Carlos A. Estrada-Vega, who recently
completed his first sculpture; and muralist Kevin Stewart-Magee,
owner of Avatar Gallery. One of the colony's most famous residents,
activist-writer Eldridge Cleaver, author of "Soul on Ice," died in
1998.</TE>

<LD>Louis PETRO, who represented last month's Hungarian Film Festival at
the Music Hall, was so confident that Gabor Herendi's "A Kind of
America" would be selected as Hungary's official Oscar entry he
decided to bring back the film for a one-week Academy
Award-qualifying run at the same theater starting Friday. As it
turned out, Gyorgy Palfi's exceedingly venturesome and original
"Hukkle," which also was screened in the recent festival, was chosen
to represent Hungary.</LD>
<LD>   On artistic grounds, "Hukkle," an elusive murder mystery in the
form of a droll ethnographic study of life in a sleepy rural village,
was by far the more appropriate choice, although "A Kind of America"
was the most popular picture in the festival, echoing its box office
triumph on home ground.</LD>
<LD>   "A Kind of America" is an amusing and sexy comedy with a capable
cast. It offers a rare opportunity to see mainstream entertainment
from Eastern Europe, which is almost invariably represented by art
films, often bleak or at best tragicomic, given the tumultuous
history of the region.</LD>
<TE>   Csaba Pindroch stars as Tamas, a young Budapest commercials
director who has written a script that has attracted the attention of
London producer Alex Brubeck (Tibor Szervet), who's willing to make a
deal -- provided that Tamas is able to raise $220,000 himself. The
film turns upon Tamas enlisting his brothers for help in both raising
the funds and keeping Brubeck entertained while visiting Budapest to
close the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the film's humor derives from the fact that the brothers
don't know that Brubeck, with whom they speak English, understands
every word they utter in their native language. The drawback in this
premise is that one is left to wonder why the brothers don't consider
from the start that Brubeck can understand their asides given that he
speaks with a mild but decided accent?</TE>
<TE>   The American Cinematheque presents the six-film "Devil or Angel: A
Tribute to Christopher Walken" Friday through Sunday at the Egyptian.
It opens with a sneak preview of Steven Spielberg's "Catch Me if You
Can," a true-life cat-and-mouse thriller starring Leonardo DiCaprio
and Tom Hanks, with Walken cast as DiCaprio's father.</TE>
<TE>   Of special interest is the Saturday-night double feature, which
teams David Cronenberg's 1983 Stephen King adaptation, "The Dead
Zone," an amazingly persuasive tale of the supernatural that emerges
as a Christ parable, and Abel Ferrara's "King of New York" (1990), in
which Walken takes on the mob to gain control of the cocaine trade.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>DEAR "Single in the City": I am 28 years old. Some of my little
friends say there is no Mr. Right. Papa says, "If you see it in
'Single in the City,' it is probably at least partly true." Please
tell me the truth. Is there a Mr. Right?</LD>
<LD>   -- Virginia O'Spinster</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Virginia: Your little friends are wrong. They have been affected
by the skepticism of a skeptical age. They do not believe except what
they see. They think that nothing can be that is not comprehensible
by their little minds. All minds, Virginia, whether they be men's or
children's, are little. But especially men's.</TE>
<TE>   In this great universe of ours, man is a mere insect, an ant, in
his intellect, as compared to the boundless world about him, as
measured by the intelligence capable of grasping the whole of truth
and knowledge. That is why men are so easy to catch and to marry.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Virginia, there is a Mr. Right, for each and every young girl
out there. He exists as certainly as love and generosity and devotion
exist, as surely as there are mothers with gleams in their eyes and
fathers with checkbooks. Alas! How dreary would be the world if there
were no Mr. Right. It would be as dreary as if there were no
Virginias.</TE>
<TE>   There would be no childlike faith then, no poetry, no romance to
make tolerable this existence. We should have no enjoyment, except in
career, travel, friends, pets, shopping, dry vodka martinis and
endless nights on the town. The external searchlight with which
desperate womanhood fills the world would be extinguished.</TE>
<TE>   Not believe in Mr. Right? You might as well not believe in
fairies. You might get your papa to hire private investigators to
perform background checks on all the gentlemen you date, watching in
all the bars to catch them doing something wrong, but even if not one
of your gentlemen friends behaved like Mr. Right, what would that
prove? Nobody sees Mr. Right, but that is no sign that there is no
Mr. Right.</TE>
<TE>   The most real things in the world are those that neither children
nor men can see -- like an excellent plastic surgery job. Did you
ever see fairies dancing on the lawn? Of course not -- but that's no
proof that they are not there. Nobody can conceive or imagine all the
wonders there are unseen and unseeable in this world. You tear apart
a Tiffany's box to see if there is a diamond ring inside, but there
is a veil covering the unseen world, which not the strongest man, nor
even the united strength of all the strongest men who ever lived,
could tear apart. Especially if they sit around watching TV and
drinking beer all day.</TE>
<TE>   Only faith, poetry, love, romance can push aside that curtain and
picture the supernal beauty and glory beyond. Is it all real? Ah,
Virginia, in all this world there is nothing else real and abiding.</TE>
<TE>   No Mr. Right? Thank God he lives, and lives forever. A thousand
years from now, Virginia, nay 10 times 10,000 years from now, he will
continue to make glad the heart of womanhood.</TE>
<TE>   Keep dreaming of a White Knight Christmas, Virginia, with silver
wedding bells ringing ding dong ding. And tell your little friends to
cork it.</TE>

<HD>Handy for the holiday</HD>
<DH>Why not just knit those gifts? Even beginners can do it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anne Valdespino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You swore you would economize and make holiday gifts this year, but
look at the calendar. Don't panic, says Suss Cousins of Suss Design.
Believe it or not, there is still time to get busy and knit some soft
cotton or wool treasures for the loved ones at the top of your list.</LD>
<LD>   Knit? Oh yeah, knit is hip. Not those big baggy reindeer sweaters,
but a host of accessories: snuggly ponchos, cute cell phone covers,
sexy leg warmers and skinny scarves that wind around your shoulders
like a homespun boa.</LD>
<LD>   It's not just for middle-aged women on jury duty -- Julia Roberts,
Sandra Bullock, Julianne Moore, Daryl Hannah and actress China Chow
all are devoted knitters, Cousins said.</LD>
<TE>   "Knitting is so hot," she said. "The hottest thing is high heels,
no stockings, just leg warmers and a miniskirt. I was in shock when I
saw them. Two women, one was with MTV in New York and one was from
the E! channel. They spent the whole afternoon in the store," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Hipsters wear leg warmers a couple of different ways, outside
their jeans with stiletto heels or even on their arms. "If you're
wearing a T-shirt and you don't want to wear a whole sweater, you put
them on your arms," she said, demonstrating by sliding a pair up past
her wrists until they rested just slightly higher than her elbow,
like those long, sleek satin gloves Grace Kelly wore in the movies.</TE>
<TE>   "They're so easy to make, too," Cousins said. Needles and yarn to
make the leg warmers cost $38, and the project takes about three
hours of your time. Of course, that's a casual three hours while
you're watching TV, sitting at home listening to music or even flying
across the country. "The big wooden needles are allowed on flights,"
Cousins points out.</TE>
<TE>   If your friends aren't fashion forward enough for leg warmers, how
about a skinny scarf? Those take only a couple of hours and can be
made for $34. They measure about 2 inches across and can be knitted
in fashion colors such as turquoise or can be made multicolored by
mixing yarn. Cousins suggests adding skinny strips of suede to dangle
at each edge for that retro/hippie look.</TE>
<TE>   "One woman who comes into the store has already made 20 of them
and she's ready to wrap. They can be super skinny, almost like a
piece of jewelry," Cousins said, winding one around her neck and
shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   If your friend is a professional gal on the go, how about a wool
bag (materials are $49 and include a stitch-in lining and loopy
handles) or a cell phone cover? "It's a funky little cell phone cover
so you can always find your phone. You stick your hand in your bag,
find the softness of it and grab it right away. It's only one skein
of yarn. You knit one long strip and it's got two little holes. It
takes about two hours and costs $48 to make."</TE>
<TE>   If you're really ambitious or have a very special friend, you
could hunker down for a couple of evenings -- about eight hours --
and make a poncho. Materials cost $75, but the poncho is a good
investment because it's versatile. It can be worn with jeans or, on
dressier occasions, over long skirts. "You can wear it with the
V-neck in the front or off to the side," Cousins said, demonstrating
a chic angle drape.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Sweden, she has been a serious knitter since she was 10.
Against her mother's advice, she started big. The reindeer sweater
meant for her little brother ended up fitting Granddad. Now she works
with costume designers and has knitted sweaters, scarves and hats for
films such as "Scooby-Doo," "Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole
Christmas" and "The Santa Clause 2."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm working on a Mike Myers sweater for 'The Cat in the Hat,' "
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Even if you've never knitted before, you can do it, Cousins said.
She's full of tips for beginners. "We have quickie knit classes here
so you get some instructions and walk out with a project. A lot of
beginners get a book, or you can get a knit kit with instructions,
needles and yarn for $24."</TE>
<TE>   "I always say use big needles and a big stitch so it goes quick
and also gives you a lofty feel so you don't get too hot, especially
in L.A.," she said.</TE>
<TE>   After 9/11, she's not surprised knitting has taken off. "When
something like that happens, you look around and say, 'I really like
so and so and I should spend more time with them, I should call, I
should write.' With knitting, you can sit down and do something and
send it to somebody. Or you can meet at a knitting event and spend
time with others thinking about how valuable friendship is. It's like
the old quilting groups."</TE>
<TE>   Cousins creates a homey atmosphere in her store with appetizers at
evening classes and coffee and bagels on Saturdays. She does whatever
she can to entice newcomers to sit, knit and fall in love with
creating garments with their own hands.</TE>
<TE>   "On a Saturday, when 12 girls walk out of the store with their
projects, I say, 'These are 12 newborn knitters,' and they say,
'Thank you soooo much.' "</TE>

<LD>AS if rooftop roller coasters and drive-through wedding chapels
weren't enough, now you can add room-ready stripper poles to the list
of over-the-top Vegas attractions. Catering to the twenty- and
thirtysomething party-hardy crowd, the Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino and
the Palms Casino Resort both offer suites with special floor and
ceiling mounts that allow for stripper poles on demand.</LD>
<LD>   "The general idea of the hotel is just to have a good time," said
Greg Sheets, director of hotel operations for the Palms, where
construction on two pole-friendly suites is expected to be completed
by Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Why go out, after all, when you can bring the entertainment to
your own room? Neither resort will hook up guests with the talent,
but in a city with one of the highest per-capita populations of women
who make their rent in a G-string, finding one who can crawl up a
pole and slither back down shouldn't be a problem.</LD>

<LD>They're blinding us with science.</LD>
<LD>   It seems as if you can't channel-surf anymore without encountering
the forensic frenzy fueled by the success of "CSI: Crime Scene
Investigation."</LD>
<LD>   Tonight at 9:30 comes the latest addition, the debut of Court TV's
"Body of Evidence: From the Case Files of Dayle Hinman," a bland but
harmless half-hour of nonfiction that may appeal to crime-show
junkies. Naturally, it airs after the basic cable network's "Forensic
Files."</LD>
<TE>   Each episode recounts a case involving Hinman, a respected
"forensic profiler" who worked in Florida law enforcement for 26
years. The premiere examines the case of a young couple found bound
and slain in their home after the wife had been raped.</TE>
<TE>   Local investigators, who knew the husband ran with a fast crowd,
figured a drug deal had gone wrong, but the evidence was baffling so
they brought in Hinman. She saw it differently: The wife, most
carefully bound, was the target and the husband simply got in the
rapist's way. Hinman's hunch was right and the killer eventually was
caught.</TE>
<TE>   After her initial reading of the crime scene photos, however,
Hinman's role in the subsequent investigation is murky. The show
would benefit if future episodes were less mysterious.</TE>

<TE>   Kathryn Bigelow directed this overlong but compelling submarine
thriller based on the true story of the brave crew of Russian's first
nuclear submarine, who in 1961 saved the world from a nuclear
catastrophe by repairing an exposed reactor core on the ship. The DVD
is watchable but offers no extraordinary goodies. There are some
short, pedestrian featurettes on the making of the film, the special
effects and makeup. The best mini-doc deals with scrupulous attention
to detail that went into the production of the film, including
building the movie sub from the original blueprints for the K-19.
Rounding out the disc is often-passionate commentary from Bigelow and
cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth.</TE>

<TE>   "Stuart Little 2"</TE>
<TE>   Geena Davis; the voice of Michael J. Fox</TE>
<TE>   Columbia TriStar: $25 for VHS; $28 for DVD</TE>
<TE>   Charming sequel to the 2000 hit adaptation of the E.B. White
classic story about the quirky Little family, who adopt a talking
mouse (voice of Fox). This time around, Stuart befriends an orphaned
bird named Margalo (voice of Melanie Griffith), who is actually
working for the villainous Falcon (voice of James Woods). Nathan Lane
also returns as the voice of the wisecracking, long-suffering Little
cat, Snowbell. Rob Minkoff, who directed the first film, also helmed
this sequel, which seamlessly combines live-action and
computer-generated characters. The pleasant DVD includes interactive
games, a music video, behind-the-scenes documentaries, a special
track that offers more small production features and fascinating
commentary from Minkoff and senior special visual effects supervisor
Jerome Chen.</TE>

<TE>   "Like Mike"</TE>
<TE>   Lil' Bow Wow, Morris Chestnut</TE>
<TE>   Fox: $20 for VHS; $28 for DVD</TE>
<TE>   The pint-size rap star headlines this nonthreatening kids' film
about a 14-year-old orphan who, when he puts on a pair of
hand-me-down sneakers that belonged to Michael Jordan, becomes a
basketball player extraordinaire. He leads the struggling L.A.
Knights to a battle for the national championship. Jonathan Lipnicki
(who also is in "Stuart Little 2"), Crispin Glover, Eugene Levy and
NBA stars also appear. The digital edition is kids' stuff, with a
couple of short featurettes, deleted scenes, a music video and boring
commentary from director John Schultz, Bow Wow and Lipnicki.</TE>

<HD>'Stuart Little 2' blazes a trail by making animation
category cut</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert W. Welkos</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Stuart Little 2," the Sony-made family film in which a
computer-generated mouse lives an adventurous life in a house with
humans, became the first movie mixing animation and live action to
become eligible for the Oscar in feature animation as the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences on Wednesday released a list of 17
films eligible for nominations in that hotly contested young
category.</LD>
<LD>   Among the leading eligible films in the award's second year are
"Ice Age," an adventure featuring a saber-toothed tiger, a sloth and
a woolly mammoth who try to reunite a lost human infant with his
parents; "Spirited Away," Hayao Miyazaki's tale of a 10-year-old girl
who wanders into a world ruled by witches and monsters; "Lilo &amp;
Stitch," Disney's story about a Hawaiian girl who adopts an
extraterrestrial as a pet; and "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron,"
the story of a wild stallion in the Old West.</LD>
<LD>   Also ruled eligible were "Adam Sandler's Eight Crazy Nights,"
"Alibaba &amp; the Forty Thieves" "Eden," "El bosque animado (The Living
Forest)," "Hey Arnold! The Movie," "Jonah -- A Veggie Tales Movie,"
"Mutant Aliens," "The Powerpuff Girls Movie," "The Princess and the
Pea," "Return to Never Land," "Treasure Planet" and "The Wild
Thornberrys."</LD>
<TE>   The eligibility of two films, "Eden" and "The Wild Thornberrys" is
subject to their opening in Los Angeles before Dec. 31. "Eden" is
scheduled to open Friday and "The Wild Thornberrys" on Dec. 20.</TE>
<TE>   In accepting "Stuart Little 2" as eligible, the executive
committee of the academy's short films and feature animation branch
is sure to widen the debate over what constitutes an animated film.</TE>
<TE>   Under academy rules, an animated film is defined as a motion
picture of at least 70 minutes running time and a significant number
of characters who are animated, and in which the animation figures in
no less than 75% of the picture's running time.</TE>
<TE>   Since many special-effects-driven films today feature both live
action and animation, films that could conceivably be eligible
include "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" and the "Star Wars"
movies. Studios of movies like those, however, prefer to pursue an
Oscar for best picture, not best animated feature.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it is a subject that is raising debate.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Koch, president of the Hollywood Animation Guild, said the
academy's decision "makes things blurry."</TE>
<TE>   "You have plenty of things that are primarily live-action with one
or two characters who are animated," he said. "I'm curious why
"Scooby-Doo" wasn't nominated.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the concern I've heard from [animators] is, does this
dilute the category into basically being a special-effects category,"
he added, noting Jar Jar Binks in "Star Wars" or Gollum in this
year's "Lord of the Rings." "On the other hand, it does give
recognition to the character animators who are working on those
films," he said. "Ultimately, the award is for the film, not the
individual."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Sito, past president of the animation guild, predicts these
hybrid films will continue to be made.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm working on a film now called 'The Looney Tunes Back in
Action' starring Brendan Fraser, Steve Martin, Bugs Bunny and Daffy
Duck. When that comes around next Christmas, is that going to
qualify?"</TE>
<TE>   "Almost every scene in 'Stuart Little 2' has animation or computer
graphics in it although audiences may not realize that," said Lucy
Fisher, who produced the film with Doug Wick. "Our four main
characters -- Stuart, Margalo the bird, Snowbell the cat, and Falcon
the villain -- are totally created in the computer. Anytime a cat is
on the screen, it is real but the visual expression isn't....The
world that Stuart lives in, a lot of it is created in a computer as
well."</TE>

<LD>Women's golf -- A Sports article Wednesday about female golfers Suzy
Whaley and Mildred "Babe" Didrikson Zaharias reported that Whaley
will be the first woman to play in a PGA Tour event. Whaley will be
the first woman to play in a PGA Tour event since the tournament
players ended their affiliation with the PGA of America in 1968 and
formed the PGA Tour. Didrikson Zaharias played in PGA events in 1938
and '45.</LD>

<HD>America Online Lays Off 300 Workers</HD>
<DH>More job cuts planned in cost-cutting program at AOL Time
Warner's struggling Internet unit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edmund Sanders</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AOL Time Warner Inc.'s beleaguered Internet division shed 300 jobs
Wednesday and plans to eliminate several hundred more next year under
a cost-cutting program designed to get the unit back on track.</LD>
<LD>   The layoffs are the first wave of a plan unveiled last week by
America Online Chief Executive Jonathan Miller, who pledged to cut
the unit's operating costs by "nine figures," or at least $100
million.</LD>
<LD>   The layoffs Wednesday amount to less than 2% of America Online's
18,000 workers worldwide.</LD>
<TE>   About half of the cuts will come at America Online's headquarters
in Dulles, Va., a company spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 60 engineering and Web-site related jobs will be
eliminated at the company's Mountain View, Calif., facility, home to
AOL's Netscape unit.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining cuts will be scattered throughout the company's
other divisions.</TE>
<TE>   Since taking the helm earlier this year, Miller has tried to
instill a more somber, austere tone at America Online.</TE>
<TE>   Last month he canceled the annual holiday party and laid off about
90 employees in the interactive marketing division.</TE>
<TE>   Miller is hoping to convince Wall Street that he is serious about
slashing costs and improving America Online's earnings, which are
expected to fall next year by 15% to 25%.</TE>
<TE>   His turnaround plan relies on improving the America Online service
with exclusive content provided by other AOL Time Warner companies
and increasing the number of broadband Internet subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   But layoffs are nothing new at America Online, which sheds jobs in
good times and bad. Last year the company slashed 1,900 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of New York-based AOL Time Warner fell 10 cents to $13.65
on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>BofA to Buy Stake in Mexican Bank</HD>
<DH>The U.S. bank will pay $1.6 billion for 25% of Santander
Serfin to capture part of a fast-growing market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Kassenaar</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bank of America Corp. said Wednesday that it will pay $1.6 billion to
buy 25% of Mexico's third-biggest bank from Santander Central
Hispano, following rival Citigroup Inc. into the fastest-growing
banking market in North America.</LD>
<LD>   The investment in Grupo Financiero Santander Serfin is Chief
Executive Ken Lewis' largest since taking over the No. 3 U.S. bank
and is critical to a strategy of opening more accounts and making
more loans to 36 million U.S. Latinos, some investors said. The
group's spending power is expected to jump 60% to $926 billion by
2007.</LD>
<LD>   In Mexico, where less than a quarter of households have a bank
account, U.S. trade ties and low interest rates are expected to help
the economy grow by 3% next year. That kind of growth has lured
international banks, which control about 80% of Mexican banking
assets.</LD>
<TE>   Citigroup in 2001 bought Grupo Financiero Banamex Accival, the
country's second-largest bank, for $12.3 billion. HSBC Holdings,
Britain's biggest bank, in August spent $1.4 billion to buy Grupo
Financiero Bital.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Angel Montano, an analyst at Grupo Financiero BBVA Bancomer,
sees the number of Mexican bank accounts doubling in the next five
years. "There's enough pie here for everyone," he said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. banks also are using their Mexican holdings as anchors in an
effort to compete in the money transfer business, dominated by First
Data Corp.'s Western Union. Mexican-Americans send about $10 billion
a year to relatives in Mexico, generating about $1 billion in fees,
Lewis said. Bank of America will use Serfin's 926 branches to capture
more of those fees, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Charlotte, N.C.-based Bank of America rose 12 cents to
$69.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Bank of America will hold its stake for at least three years, the
banks said. After that, it has the option to sell the stake back to
Santander or to investors. It will name two directors to the bank.</TE>
<TE>   Bank of America, with 4,200 U.S. branches, said about 75% of U.S.
Latinos live in its service area. Most of the 550 branches it plans
to build in the next three years will be in cities with fast-growing
Latino populations, such as Los Angeles and Miami.</TE>
<TE>   The bank has a three-pronged plan to target Latino customers in
the U.S., Lewis said: selling stocks and other investments to people
with established banking relationships; providing credit cards,
mortgages and auto loans to people with basic bank accounts; and
attracting people who don't have bank accounts and typically don't
trust the banking system.</TE>

<HD>Economy Hits Growth of Overseas Phone Calls</HD>
<DH>With less money to spend, many customers cut back last year
on international dialing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James S. Granelli</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a decade of explosive growth, the volume of international
telephone calls increased at the slowest pace on record last year as
tough economic times helped put the squeeze on dialing overseas.</LD>
<LD>   Consumers and businesses worldwide spent 144 billion minutes -- or
a combined total of 274,000 years -- on calls abroad in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   That was just an 8.5% jump over 2000, a year in which call volume
grew a record 23%. And it was well below the 14% annual average
growth rate since records were first compiled in 1984, according to a
new report by Washington-based research firm TeleGeography Inc.</LD>
<TE>   Stephan Beckert, a TeleGeography analyst who directed the
research, said that when results for 2002 are compiled, he expects
them to show growth closer to historical levels. Other industry
experts, however, think the sluggishness has continued this year.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, not even plummeting prices slowed the slide in growth.
Instead, falling prices fueled by better technology and new
competition pummeled the bottom lines of telecommunications companies
-- and they are unlikely to find much relief soon.</TE>
<TE>   "Prices worldwide have fallen 70% to 90% in the past two years,
and companies need a tenfold increase in volume just to keep revenues
even," Beckert said.</TE>
<TE>   TeleGeography tracks international calls from statistics gathered
in its own worldwide survey of 4,700 companies in 123 countries and
from data that some 1,800 U.S. international carriers are required to
file with the Federal Communications Commission. No filings are
required for domestic long-distance calls, and companies keep those
numbers secret.</TE>
<TE>   International calling -- from regular lines, cell phones and
calling cards -- is an important gauge of overall market trends.
Excluded from the report, and unable to be measured, are business
calls over private corporate networks and data traffic such as
Internet e-mails.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts attribute last year's slide to the sluggish economy,
reduced business activity worldwide and a slowdown in travel,
particularly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. International
trade through the United States fell 6% last year, according to
Commerce Department statistics.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, Beckert said, business calls have accounted for half
of global call volume. But 30% of all calls come from mobile phones
these days, he said, and even carriers can't figure out if they are
business- or consumer-generated.</TE>
<TE>   "When we see a return of economic growth, we'll see a return in
international calling," said telecom analyst Ken McGee of Gartner
Inc., a research firm in Stamford, Conn. "And if you believe the
forecasts, that means we'll see it later in 2003."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to last year's falloff, international calling soared
from 1991 to 2001. During that period, U.S. calls to foreign
countries grew more than sixfold to 37.3 billion minutes amid a
nearly fourfold increase in total worldwide voice traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico and Canada were, by far, the top destinations called from
U.S. phones last year, each accounting for about 5 billion minutes in
outgoing calls, according to the report. Beckert said carriers don't
know what's driving such calls, but they suspect that about 10% of it
is foreign traffic being rerouted through cheaper U.S. lines.</TE>
<TE>   Hans Johnson, a researcher at the Public Policy Institute of
California, figures immigration helped drive the Mexico calls; the
number of Mexican-born residents in the United States doubled in the
last decade.</TE>
<TE>   E-mails, especially as a replacement for faxes, have taken a bit
of a bite out of international calling, but Beckert maintains that
the loss is not significant.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Boon Intrarakha, whose Thai Dynasty Carpet Inc. in
Artesia relied heavily on telephone fax machines a few years ago, is
now conducting most business over the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "The telephone is actually not being used a lot right now," he
said, adding that he relies on e-mail most of the time to contact his
brother and sister in Bangkok.</TE>
<TE>   Growth in personal calling may be slower to recover than that in
business calling, particularly if prices rise again.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, everyone who wants to call overseas in Europe and the
U.S., which together make up two-thirds of the international traffic,
already is, and they aren't calling much more," Beckert said.</TE>
<TE>   McGee points out that many immigrants have a limited list of
people to call.</TE>
<TE>   "It's Mom in Ireland, a sister in Ireland, a brother in Israel,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, personal calling "may have reached a point of relative
saturation," said Bill Marmon, vice president of WorldCom Inc.'s
international unit, the world's largest carrier of international
voice traffic.</TE>
<TE>   "We see voice in general as a mature market, as opposed to data,
so it makes sense that growth would slow," he said, while also
pointing out that international calling is "still a very important
market and still growing."</TE>
<TE>   Rebecca Kim of Irvine uses low-cost calling plans that allow her
to ring her family and friends in her native South Korea, but she
still watches her time on the phone.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to go on and on and on. I limit myself to important
things first, and I call when necessary," she said. "I don't call any
more often just because the rates went down."</TE>
<TE>   Prepaid calling cards, which have become popular among travelers,
also are being used to limit long-distance phoning.</TE>
<TE>   Chelo Jarme of Cypress, who says she loses track of time on calls
to her family in Manila, has been using cards for the last few years.
When time runs out on the card, she said, "that's it for the month."</TE>
<TE>   "Now I call two to four times a month, mostly to my mom. She wants
to hear my voice," Jarme said. "I do a lot of e-mailing with my three
sisters."</TE>
<TE>   The slower growth in international calling has forced some changes
at telecom firms from WorldCom and AT&amp;T Corp. to overseas
conglomerates such as Deutsche Telekom in Germany, Beckert said.</TE>
<TE>   The carriers have cut international calling costs, outsourced less
profitable services and focused on promoting their major routes, he
said. The changes are part of overall restructurings industrywide as
carriers cope with too much global capacity and mountains of debt.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year was not a great year for telecoms in general," Marmon
said. "At WorldCom, we did cut out some of our wholesale
international voice business, and we're more careful about the prices
we are charging. The price decline has slowed."</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, WorldCom filed for bankruptcy protection. Of the top
10 international providers in 1999, seven have filed Chapter 11
petitions to reorganize debts or have gone out of business.</TE>
<TE>   To help with cost cuts, telecoms also are turning more to an
Internet technology known as Voice over Internet Protocol, or VoIP,
to carry voice calls. VoIP allows telecoms to push phone traffic in
Internet fashion to get around the high fees that other companies
charge for completing calls.</TE>
<TE>   VoIP transfers, which occur without callers even knowing it is
happening, accounted for 9.9 billion minutes last year, 71% higher
than the previous year. Adding that to the total, though, would
increase overall growth to only 10%, TeleGeography said.</TE>
<TE>   TeleGeography started compiling VoIP traffic in 1998, but it was
barely a blip until 2000. Beckert said he expected the technology to
become more of a factor in the coming years.</TE>

<HD>Terms Are Set for U.S.-Chile Trade Pact</HD>
<DH>The proposed agreement is the first with a South American
nation and would lift tariffs on 85% of goods.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Evelyn Iritani</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The United States and Chile concluded negotiations Wednesday on a
free-trade agreement that will lower barriers for U.S. farm goods,
machinery and services, expanding the U.S. campaign to create a trade
zone stretching from Alaska to the tip of South America.</LD>
<LD>   Beneficiaries of the wide-ranging pact include California beef and
pork producers and Midwest grain and soybean growers. The deal also
would provide Silicon Valley technology firms tougher intellectual
property protection and allow U.S. banks to offer pension services to
Chilean consumers. Two-way trade between the two countries totaled
$8.8 billion in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Under the proposed U.S.-Chile agreement -- the first between the
United States and a South American country -- tariffs on more than
85% of consumer and industrial goods would be lifted immediately and
tariffs on three-quarters of farm goods would disappear within four
years, according to the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. The
remaining tariffs and quotas on agriculture goods, one of the most
sensitive arenas, would be phased out over 12 years.</LD>
<TE>   The pact would open the door wider for Chilean products that have
already made dramatic inroads in the United States, particularly in
fruits and vegetables and processed foods. For that reason, the U.S.
farm community had mixed feelings.</TE>
<TE>   "They have the potential to export more to us than we have the
ability to export there," said Bruce Berven, executive director of
the California Beef Council in Pleasanton. "But we believe in free
trade, and this is precedent-setting."</TE>
<TE>   Activists vowed to oppose the deal, which must be submitted to the
two governments for approval. The deal also was attacked by tobacco
foes, who accused the Bush administration of caving in to tobacco
interests by dropping plans to exclude their products from tariff
cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "This last-minute, closed-door reversal is only the latest example
of this administration's willingness to appease Big Tobacco at the
expense of public health," said Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), who
along with Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) called for an
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and Chilean trade officials emphasized that the implications
extend far beyond the trade relationship, giving a boost to the
proposed regional trade bloc known as the Free Trade Area of the
Americas. It also bolsters a key free-trade supporter in a region
where economic and political turbulence has unleashed anti-trade
sentiments.</TE>
<TE>   "Chile is an ideal free-trade partner for the United States
because of its sound macroeconomic policies and commitment to free
trade," U.S. Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick said in a
statement announcing the agreement's completion.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has made the hemisphere-wide free-trade agreement a
top priority, and the United States has recently started free trade
talks with five Central American countries, Australia, and six
African countries. The U.S., which also is wrapping up a trade
agreement with Singapore, currently has free-trade agreements with
Canada, Mexico, Israel and Jordan.</TE>

<LD>Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) on Wednesday called for hearings by
the Senate Energy Committee to examine possible manipulation of
Western energy markets and to urge federal regulators to penalize
misbehaving companies.</LD>
<LD>   Feinstein sent a letter to incoming committee Chairman Pete V.
Domenici (R-N.M.) after listening to audio tapes in which traders
from AES Corp. and Williams Cos. discussed plans to deliberately shut
down one Southern California power plant that AES operated for
Williams and to prolong a maintenance closure at another in April and
May 2000. Parts of the conversations were first made public last
month by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which gave
Feinstein the audio tapes Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   AES and Williams have denied wrongdoing. The companies settled a
FERC inquiry by agreeing to pay $8 million.</LD>
<TE>   Feinstein said she believes the tapes "demonstrate very clearly
that market manipulation led to the dramatic escalation of price in
the Western energy market in 2000."</TE>

<HD>Donaldson Familiar With Dot-Com Bust</HD>
<DH>The SEC nominee has seen a once-hot Internet firm stumble.
He resigned last month as independent director.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas S. Mulligan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Along with many other investors, the newly nominated head of the
Securities and Exchange Commission surfed the dot-com stock wave in
the late 1990s.</LD>
<LD>   As a director of EasyLink Services Corp., William H. Donaldson
watched the company's share price quadruple after its initial public
offering in June 1999.</LD>
<LD>   The stock has since crashed to under $1, and the Edison,
N.J.-based firm says its survival as a going concern is questionable.</LD>
<TE>   Donaldson, 71, whom President Bush nominated Tuesday to be SEC
chairman, resigned from the EasyLink board Nov. 12, citing "personal
reasons," the company said in a recent filing with the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   Donaldson was unavailable for comment Wednesday, a White House
spokeswoman said. No one has suggested that there was any impropriety
on Donaldson's part in his involvement with EasyLink.</TE>
<TE>   The company, formerly Mail.com, was founded in 1995 by Gerald
Gorman, a 12-year investment banking veteran of Donaldson's former
brokerage, Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. Donaldson
signed on as an EasyLink director in April 1998.</TE>
<TE>   As one of three independent, or nonemployee, directors, Donaldson
had served on the board's key audit and compensation committees.</TE>
<TE>   EasyLink provides e-mail and other services for businesses, and
the concept was hot enough to spark a huge run-up in the firm's IPO
in 1999, amid the general mania for dot-com shares.</TE>
<TE>   The stock soared from its offering price of $7 a share to $25
within three weeks of the IPO, and it reached $27 later in 1999. But
the shares collapsed with most other dot-com issues in 2000 and 2001.
They traded Wednesday at 76 cents on the Nasdaq Stock Market.</TE>
<TE>   The percentage decline is worse than it looks: To try to boost its
share price, EasyLink declared a 1-for-10 reverse stock split in
January. That initially lifted the price from 47 cents to $4.70, and
meant that the company's peak price in 1999 was $271, adjusted for
the split.</TE>
<TE>   But the stock has spiraled mostly lower since January. EasyLink
has yet to turn a profit, and warned in its latest quarterly
financial report that its future is in doubt.</TE>
<TE>   "If we are unable to raise new additional financing, generate
sufficient cash flow, or otherwise restructure our debt service
obligations, we may be unable to continue as a going concern," the
company said.</TE>
<TE>   In the quarter ended Sept. 30 EasyLink said it had revenue of $28
million, down from $30 million a year earlier. The company said its
pro-forma loss from continuing operations was $1.4 million, compared
with a loss of $1.5 million a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   EasyLink said in a recent filing with the SEC that it must replace
Donaldson with another qualified independent director or face
delisting of its stock by Nasdaq. The firm also could face delisting
because its shares have fallen below $1, it said in the filing.</TE>
<TE>   In EasyLink's proxy statement this year, the company said that as
of Feb. 28, Donaldson held 13,000 shares of common stock plus 21,500
options that were convertible into common stock when exercised. The
options were exercisable within 60 days of Feb. 28, the statement
said. No exercise price was given.</TE>
<TE>   In November 2000, in an effort to retain employees in the face of
the stock slump, EasyLink repriced a number of its outstanding
options to employees, officers and directors, lowering the exercise
price to $16.90 a share, adjusted for last January's split. It could
not be determined whether any of Donaldson's options were affected.</TE>
<TE>   Donaldson, who must be confirmed as SEC chief by the Senate, was a
co-founder of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette in 1959. The firm was sold
to Credit Suisse First Boston in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Donaldson served in the Ford administration and was chairman of
the New York Stock Exchange from 1990 to 1995. He has been a director
of a several companies besides EasyLink, including Aetna Inc. and
Bright Horizons Family Solutions Inc.</TE>

<HD>Halliburton Agrees to Asbestos Settlement</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Halliburton Co. agreed to pay as much as $4.2 billion in cash and
stock to settle asbestos-related claims against several current and
former units and wipe out future asbestos liability, plaintiffs
lawyers say.</LD>
<LD>   The world's second-largest oil-services company will pay $2.75
billion in cash and issue $1.4 billion in stock to compensate workers
and others for health problems tied to asbestos, said Peter Kraus, a
lawyer for asbestos claimants in the Harbison-Walker Refractories
bankruptcy case. The unit was formerly owned by Halliburton's Dresser
Industries subsidiary.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement allows Halliburton to avoid a bankruptcy filing and
create a trust to pay its asbestos liability as part of Harbison's
Chapter 11 case, Kraus said. Asbestos suits have forced 20 companies
to file for bankruptcy protection since January 2000, including Owens
Corning and Federal-Mogul Corp., and may cost U.S. businesses more
than $200 billion, consulting firm Towers Perrin estimates.</LD>
<TE>   "They are buying peace from asbestos litigation for all time,"
Kraus said.</TE>
<TE>   Halliburton said in a statement that the postponement was
requested by creditors in the Harbison bankruptcy case. Company
spokeswoman Wendy Hall declined to comment further on the case.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Houston-based Halliburton on Wednesday rose 57 cents to
$20.40 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Halliburton has predicted that its asbestos litigation expenses
will reach $2.2 billion by 2017. Asbestos, used as an insulating and
fireproofing material until the 1980s, has been tied to lung cancer.</TE>

<HD>Dissident Urges Tenet Management Change</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald D. White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The leader of a dissident shareholder group Wednesday demanded that
Tenet Healthcare Corp.'s board of directors oust the company's senior
management.</LD>
<LD>   In a nine-page letter to the board, M. Lee Pearce, a Florida
doctor and chairman of a group that controls a tiny fraction of
Tenet's shares outstanding, also called for the appointment of a
special committee of nonmanagement board members "to investigate past
practices and review quality of care" issues.</LD>
<LD>   "It is time for the Board of Tenet Healthcare Corporation to stand
up and take back the company from a management team that has
neglected its duties," wrote Pearce, who two years ago led a failed
effort to oust Chairman and Chief Executive Jeffrey C. Barbakow and
three other directors of the Santa Barbara-based company.</LD>
<TE>   Pearce said Tenet's latest woes, including federal inquiries into
the company's billing practices, showed that his group had taken the
right stance back in October 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet spokesman Harry Anderson accused Pearce of piling on,
saying: "Dr. Pearce is late coming to this party, and his rhetoric
doesn't seem to have anything new in it. Our board, however, will
seriously consider his suggestions."</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Pearce's group owned directly and through affiliates
about 250,000 shares of Tenet stock. That has since dropped to about
25,000 shares, according to a spokesman for the group. In all, Tenet
has about 450 million shares outstanding.</TE>
<TE>   Pearce's comments surfaced as Tenet's board announced it has
authorized the repurchase of 16.3 million of the company's shares,
which have lost two-thirds of their value in the last two months.
Tenet announced earlier that it was buying back 13.7 million shares.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet's stock closed down 26 cents at $17.30 on the New York Stock
Exchange, but rose to $17.60 in after-hours trading.</TE>
<TE>   Separately on Wednesday, state Senate President Pro Tem John
Burton (D-San Francisco) called for an investigation into allegations
that Tenet overbilled for workers' compensation cases.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it hadn't reviewed Burton's remarks and couldn't
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the Service Employees International Union and others are
set to hold a news conference to condemn Tenet's nurse-staffing
practices. The company said the claims had no merit.</TE>

<HD>HP to Take Over Billing at DirecTV</HD>
<DH>The computer company hopes the 5-year deal will boost
earnings in its growing managed services division.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Terril Yue Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. plans to announce a contract today with El
Segundo-based DirecTV that HP hopes will help its managed services
business grow at twice the rate of the industry as a whole.</LD>
<LD>   Under the deal, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, Palo
Alto-based HP will supply and manage the satellite television
provider's billing infrastructure for five years. Billing is a
complex operation for DirecTV, which sees subscribers surge around
televised events such as the Super Bowl, a boxing championship or a
season of HBO's "The Sopranos."</LD>
<LD>   Even after its acquisition of Compaq Computer Corp. in May, HP
Services remains the smallest of HP's four main divisions as measured
by revenue. But the division, which includes the managed services
business, is one of the two that made money last quarter, bringing in
operating profit of $381 million for the three months ended Oct. 31.</LD>
<TE>   "One of the key drivers in the merger was to place into the market
a credible alternative to IBM" for providing computer services to
customers, said Joe Hogan, HP's vice president of managed services.
HP is one of the largest providers in the fiercely competitive
computer services industry, along with IBM Corp., Electronic Data
Systems Corp. and Computer Sciences Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Last month HP reported that managed services revenue grew 14% in
the fiscal fourth quarter compared with the previous fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   That growth rate "is pushing twice the industry," Hogan said.</TE>
<TE>   Hogan would not give additional details about the contract with
DirecTV, a unit of General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Electronics Corp.
with about 11 million subscribers. DirecTV spokesman Bob Marsocci
said the company does not comment on the financial terms of its
deals.</TE>
<TE>   The DirecTV contract is smaller than one HP announced in September
with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. That agreement, worth $1.5
billion, would provide the Toronto-based bank with an overarching
information technology infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   HP also is announcing today an alliance with NEC Corp. of Tokyo to
provide computer services to high-end customers in Japan, China and
the U.S. The partnership could include joint ventures for the
delivery of services from small-scale managed computer services to
taking over a customer's information technology assets and staff.</TE>
<TE>   "We're bringing our global reach and process and methodology,
they're bringing their mission-critical support, and hopefully we're
going to be able to create some very attractive value propositions
for people, especially in the Japanese market," Hogan said.</TE>
<TE>   HP shares slipped 45 cents to $18.23 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Slow Year for IPOs of California Companies</HD>
<DH>A 'broken' offering by Seagate shows a difficult market,
but some see signs of recovery in 2003.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For a quick summary of the market for initial public stock offerings,
look no further than the reception investors gave computer disk-drive
maker Seagate Technology Holdings on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   After the company priced its new shares at $12 each late Tuesday
-- compared with expectations of $13 to $15 -- Seagate slumped to
close at $11.50 in its debut trading session on the New York Stock
Exchange, rendering it "broken" in market-speak.</LD>
<LD>   Seagate, which is incorporated in the Cayman Islands but is run
from Scotts Valley, Calif., is one of only 16 California companies to
be taken public this year. Indeed, 2002 is shaping up to be the
slowest year for IPOs by California companies since at least 1980,
according to data tracker Thomson Financial.</LD>
<TE>   The national picture isn't much better: A total of 82 companies
nationwide have floated IPOs this year, also the slowest pace in at
least a decade.</TE>
<TE>   The long bear market has made many investors unwilling to take a
chance on shares of new companies. That has been particularly true in
the technology sector, which dominated the IPO business in the late
1990s. Many of that era's tech stock offerings -- including a long
list of California firms -- have crashed and burned.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts found what little hope they could in Seagate's
ability to raise $870 million in a brutal market climate for tech
shares.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that Seagate is a 'broken' deal is tremendously
disappointing. It's a benchmark deal, the last big one for 2002,"
said David Menlow, head of IPO Financial Network in Milburn, N.J.
"But the fact that an $870-million tech deal got done at all is
impressive."</TE>
<TE>   Seagate is an atypical IPO. It was a public company until two
years ago, when it was taken private in a leveraged buyout. The firm
isn't a fledgling business: It's the largest maker of computer disk
drives, with annual sales of about $6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the stock's fall on Wednesday, some experts see signs that
the IPO market has stabilized and could be poised for recovery.</TE>
<TE>   "The prospects for IPOs and secondary offerings have turned
positive," said Ed Wedbush, chief executive of Wedbush Morgan
Securities, a Los Angeles-based investment bank. "The deals are
getting done, a few of them every week."</TE>
<TE>   Still, investors have good reason to be wary: Of the 16 California
companies that have gone public this year, shares of 10 of them are
trading below their offering prices.</TE>
<TE>   As for 2003, much depends on whether the stock market overall
continues to rebound from the five-year lows of October.</TE>
<TE>   The IPO market has perked up since October as investors have
"tested the waters" with deals such as Wynn Resorts Ltd., the Stephen
Wynn-led company that is building a Las Vegas luxury hotel, said Ben
Holmes, who covers new issues for Morningnotes.com in Boulder, Colo.
Wynn Resorts was priced at $13 a share. The stock has since notched a
modest gain, closing at $13.25 Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Some recent deals have fared better, Holmes said, pointing to
Portfolio Recovery Associates Inc., a Virginia company that collects
on defaulted consumer loans, and Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Those
stocks are up 43% and 29%, respectively, from their offering prices.</TE>
<TE>   Although the backlog of California IPOs remains thin, investors'
appetite for new stocks could be whetted in 2003 if some upcoming big
deals perform well.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles-based real estate firm Maguire Properties Inc., whose
$750-million IPO might come as soon as January, stands to benefit if
the economy looks strong, Holmes said: "In a rebounding economy, does
commercial real estate become a darling sector? It may, as businesses
look to increase their workforce and need more space."</TE>
<TE>   In the tech arena, NPTest Inc., the San Jose-based semiconductor
testing unit of Schlumberger Ltd. that hopes to raise $489 million,
also could be a closely watched deal if it materializes in the first
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   But some veteran investors warn that there could be more pain
coming for the tech sector.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of us remember that when the stock market tanked in October
1987, the IPO market didn't come back for high-tech companies until
the middle of 1991," said Fred Haney, a venture capitalist with
Arcturus Capital in L.A. "If you look back at the stock market
charts, that 1987 sell-off looks like a blip compared to this time
around. Plus, the technology business sector is in a real state of
recession, if not depression."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, some private California tech companies say they are
guardedly optimistic that a strong IPO market will return in late
2003 or early 2004, allowing them to go public.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm absolutely hoping to head in [the IPO] direction at that
time, but it will all depend on whether the capital market comes
back," said Cyrus Hadavi, chief executive of L.A.-based Adexa Inc., a
supply-chain software company launched in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Adexa landed $15 million in venture capital financing in the third
quarter, the fifth infusion for the company. Hadavi, who has trimmed
his payroll to 250 employees from 410 at the end of 2000, said his
company should not need any more venture funding, but he isn't taking
any chances.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be using that money very carefully," he said.</TE>

<HD>K2 in Talks to Acquire Rawlings</HD>
<DH>The ski and snowboard maker confirms that it's negotiating
with the U.S. sporting-goods legend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Hirsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>K2 Inc. is making a pitch for Rawlings Sporting Goods Co., one of
America's oldest suppliers of baseball gloves and equipment, a move
designed to make the Los Angeles-based snowboard and ski manufacturer
a company for all seasons.</LD>
<LD>   K2, which sells Olin skis, Ride and Morrow snowboards as well as
Shakespeare fishing gear, confirmed Wednesday that it has been in
talks to take over 115-year-old Rawlings, of Fenton, Mo., since last
month. Details of the discussions weren't disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   "We are looking for a business that is counter-cyclical to our
other brands," said Richard Heckmann, K2's chairman and chief
executive.</LD>
<TE>   Rawlings is among the most recognizable brand names in baseball,
according to Craig Levra, chief executive of Sport Chalet Inc., the
La Canada Flintridge-based chain of sporting goods stores.</TE>
<TE>   Brothers Alfred and George Rawlings founded the company in 1887 as
a retail store in St. Louis and eventually made a number of important
equipment innovations that changed the way America's most popular
sports are played.</TE>
<TE>   Although known for its association with baseball -- most major
league players use Rawlings fielding gloves -- 100 years ago the
company developed the first shoulder pads for football. Later, it
made the first baseball glove with a pocket between the thumb and
fingers.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, investors have waited for Rawlings to leverage
its premium brand name and long association with the national pastime
into a bigger company, said Anthony Palma, chief executive of Van
Nuys-based Easton Sports Inc., a major manufacturer of baseball and
hockey equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Rawlings has seen almost no growth, Palma said. The company
went public in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Rawlings' sales of $173.7 million in its 2002 fiscal year were
only slightly higher than the $170.6 million it posted in 1998. It
earned $3.4 million last year, which was double its 2001 earnings.
But the company lost a combined $16 million in 1999 and 2000.</TE>
<TE>   It was not certain whether K2 will be able to score with the
venerable baseball company. Key terms of the deal -- believed to be a
stock transaction -- are to be determined and Rawlings plans to
consider other alternatives, according to K2.</TE>
<TE>   Rawlings said in November that it was talking to a suitor but did
not disclose it was K2. However, after learning acquisition talks
were underway, Rawlings' largest shareholder, Daniel Gilbert, offered
to pay $8 a share in cash for the company, or about $65 million.
Gilbert, who owns 14% of Rawlings, said he may go higher, depending
on his due diligence review of the company's operations.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Rawlings shares rose 19 cents to $8.24 on Nasdaq.
The stock has gained 175% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Rawlings has said that it will consider Gilbert's proposal. But on
Wednesday the company wasn't talking about either offer. Chairman and
CEO Steve O'Hara did not return calls.</TE>
<TE>   For Heckmann, a Rawlings acquisition would fit with his plans to
expand K2 into a major sporting goods maker by gobbling up multiple
brands. The strategy is similar to what he pursued as head of water
company US Filter, which he built into a multibillion-dollar firm
before selling it to French utility and entertainment conglomerate
Vivendi Universal for $6.2 billion in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   K2 has annual sales of about $600 million. It swung to a profit of
$3.9 million in the third quarter from a loss of $10.7 million a year
earlier. Sales rose slightly to $149.8 million in the quarter from
$148.1 million the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   "Rawlings sells to the same retailers that we sell our lines to,"
said Heckmann, who has been K2's chairman since April 2000 and became
CEO in October.</TE>
<TE>   K2 shares fell 11 cents to $10.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Extend Rebound for 2nd Day With Slim Gains</HD>
<DH>The Dow advances 0.2% and Nasdaq climbs 0.4%. Natural gas
futures rise to a 19-month high.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks ended a tepid trading session Wednesday with a moderate
advance, extending Tuesday's rebound from recent profit taking.</LD>
<LD>   In commodities trading, natural gas futures prices continued to
surge, reaching 19-month highs in New York.</LD>
<LD>   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrials started the day with a
loss, but finished up 14.88 points, or 0.2%, at 8,589.14.</LD>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite also recovered from an early decline to close
up 5.83 points, or 0.4%, at 1,396.59.</TE>
<TE>   Winners topped losers by 18 to 15 on the New York Stock Exchange.
On Nasdaq, winners had a slight edge.</TE>
<TE>   Blue chips were under pressure early in the session after paper
and personal products maker Kimberly-Clark warned that its
fourth-quarter and 2003 earnings would be below expectations. The
company said fourth-quarter results would be below year-ago earnings
because of heated competition in the diaper market.</TE>
<TE>   However, the stock's decline was modest: It lost $1.15 to $46.78.</TE>
<TE>   After regular trading ended, Kimberly-Clark rival Procter &amp; Gamble
raised its estimate for operating earnings growth in the current
quarter to the high single digits, from previous guidance of mid- to
high single digits. The company cited strength in its health-care
unit and in developing markets.</TE>
<TE>   P&amp;G, a Dow stock, eased 19 cents to $87.46 in regular trading,
then jumped to $89.65 in after-hours activity.</TE>
<TE>   P&amp;G's optimism matches the view many institutional investors have
about corporate results, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "You have an improving picture and a better story for 2003," said
Kevin Caron, market strategist at Ryan, Beck &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Some market bulls say with news of corporate financial scandals
dissipating, investors will be paying closer attention to the
economy's progress, which bodes well for stocks.</TE>
<TE>   "My belief is that we have completed the unwinding of the [market]
bubble, and the stock market will recover with the economy," said
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the profit taking that slammed the market last week shows
that many investors have trigger fingers, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   In other trading Wednesday, near-term natural gas futures in New
York closed at $4.71 per million British thermal units, up from $4.64
on Tuesday and the highest since May 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Prices have surged in recent weeks as cold weather in much of the
nation has drawn down gas supplies.</TE>
<TE>   In the Treasury bond market, yields eased slightly across the
board. The 10-year T-note fell to 4.02% from 4.05% Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Among Wednesday's market highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Insurance stocks were mostly higher after MetLife said it
expects operating earnings in 2003 to rise at least 10% as it cuts
costs. The stock jumped $1.50 to $28.15.</TE>
<TE>   Also in the sector, American International Group gained 87 cents
to $61.62, CNA Financial rose $1.98 to $26.28 and Hartford Financial
was up 61 cents to $47.33.</TE>
<TE>   * Some gas-related stocks advanced. Nicor rose $1.01 to $32.80 and
Kinder Morgan added 45 cents to $34.89.</TE>
<TE>   * Health-maintenance organization shares attracted buyers.
WellPoint Health jumped $1.76 to $70.80 and Oxford Health gained
$1.33 to $37.45.</TE>
<TE>   * Baxter International slid $1.93 to $28.78 after the medical
products firm said it will sell 13 million new shares of stock to pay
for acquisitions and retire debt.</TE>
<TE>   * Many software stocks rallied after Lehman Bros. analyst Neil
Herman said Oracle may top consensus revenue and earnings estimates
when it reports quarterly results Dec. 18.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle, the third-biggest software maker, jumped 60 cents to
$11.30. Other winners in the sector included PeopleSoft, up 59 cents
to $17.97, and Computer Associates, up 27 cents to $13.68.</TE>

<HD>DirecTV's NFL Deal Jumps Sharply</HD>
<DH>'NFL Sunday Ticket' package probably will become a loss
leader for the satellite TV firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sallie Hofmeister</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>DirecTV Inc. will triple what it pays to the National Football League
starting next year to renew its exclusive rights to the "NFL Sunday
Ticket" package of games, sources said.</LD>
<LD>   The increase to $400 million through 2007 makes it one of the
biggest increases in sports rights fees in recent years -- and
threatens to saddle DirecTV with a money loser.</LD>
<LD>   DirecTV and the NFL announced Wednesday that a deal had been
reached but did not disclose the price. Sources said, however, that
the large sum DirecTV is paying underscores the importance of sports
to the leading satellite company as it battles both cable and
satellite rivals.</LD>
<TE>   It also highlights the negotiating prowess of the NFL, which has
been more successful than any other sports league in extracting huge
rate increases for its TV rights.</TE>
<TE>   DirecTV executives say the deal will allow them to retain some of
their most valued subscribers -- the ones willing to pay a premium
for TV choices -- and also attract new customers.</TE>
<TE>   They also contend that DirecTV can make a profit on the pact, even
without raising subscriber prices more than they have in the past --
about 5% annually.</TE>
<TE>   But analysis are skeptical. They say that based on current
subscription rates and the 1.5 million customers for "NFL Sunday
Ticket," DirecTV stands to lose more than $100 million a year under
the new contract.</TE>
<TE>   DirecTV currently pays an average of $130 million a year for the
package, which entitles subscribers to watch all of the league's
Sunday games for about $180 a season.</TE>
<TE>   Cable operators have long coveted the NFL package, but industry
officials say the NFL never seriously negotiated with them.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, sources say, the NFL used EchoStar Communications Corp.
as a stalking horse in the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   After federal regulators rejected a proposed merger of EchoStar
and DirecTV parent Hughes Electronics Corp. in October, the NFL pit
the nation's two satellite competitors against each other.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar had never bid aggressively for sports rights, but DirecTV
executives worried that its rival might do so this time. DirecTV also
didn't want to lose the marquee package at a time it is coming up for
sale after the failed merger.</TE>
<TE>   DirecTV has offered "NFL Sunday Ticket" exclusively since its
inception in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Some sports fans complain that the exclusive contract makes these
so-called out-of-market games unavailable to the TV masses. But
DirecTV and the NFL portrayed the new agreement as a boon to viewers.
As part of the new contract, DirecTV will launch a new NFL Channel on
its basic satellite service next year that won't feature games but
will be entirely dedicated to football.</TE>
<TE>   Although DirecTV will retain exclusive satellite rights to the
package for five years, the NFL will be able to offer it to cable
operators in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Fox and CBS -- which hold the rights to NFL Sunday games on
broadcast TV -- prevented the NFL from taking the ticket package to
cable before then because of the potential risk to their ratings.
Networks see DirecTV as less of a threat than cable. That's because
the satellite leader reaches only about 10% of American TV
households, while cable reaches 70%.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Fox's parent, News Corp., was keen on keeping the NFL
package intact at DirecTV, which it hopes to buy.</TE>

<HD>Northrop and TRW Shareholders Give OK to Merger</HD>
<DH>Deal gives the Pentagon a third contractor capable of
developing the most-sophisticated weapon systems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Pae</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shareholders approved Northrop Grumman Corp.'s purchase of TRW Inc.
for $7 billion Wednesday, creating a defense behemoth that will make
everything from aircraft carriers and spy satellites to White House
Web sites and translation programs for Balkan languages.</LD>
<LD>   In sheer size, Northrop will be rivaled only by Lockheed Martin
Corp., the nation's largest defense contractor. Northrop will have
customers in virtually all branches of the government, including the
Pentagon, NASA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The merger also will dramatically alter the industry's landscape,
adding Northrop to what so far had been a duel between Lockheed and
Boeing Co. for developing the nation's most-sophisticated weapon
systems.</LD>
<LD>   With the acquisition of TRW, Century City-based Northrop becomes
the government's biggest information technology company, surpassing
Lockheed. It also becomes one of the leading makers of space systems
and electronics, competing against Boeing, the world's largest
commercial satellite maker.</LD>
<TE>   Northrop, which has been on an eight-year acquisition binge, is
already the world's largest shipbuilder and defense electronics
maker. TRW represents Northrop's 16th and largest acquisition.</TE>
<TE>   "They are certainly one of the premiere military space companies
anywhere, and Northrop wasn't that at all before TRW," said Paul H.
Nisbet, aerospace analyst for JSA Research Inc. "They've now got
their hand in a lot of major government programs."</TE>
<TE>   Northrop executives said the biggest gain from the TRW merger
would be the added capability of developing lucrative programs such
as the nation's multibillion-dollar missile defense system.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a capstone acquisition for Northrop," Chief Executive
Kent Kresa said during an interview Wednesday after presiding over a
special shareholder meeting at the Fairmont Miramar Hotel in Santa
Monica. Just hours earlier, TRW shareholders in Cleveland approved
the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop will begin completing the previously announced sale of
TRW's automobile parts business to Blackstone Group, a New York
private equity firm. The sale, expected to close during the first
quarter of 2003, will give Northrop about $4.5 billion in cash, which
will be used to help pay debt.</TE>
<TE>   After all the transactions are completed, Northrop's debt level
will be about 26% of revenue, down from the high 30s, and leave the
company with the "strongest balance sheet that we have had as far as
I can remember," Kresa said.</TE>
<TE>   Kresa said the integration of TRW's businesses would begin
immediately with the renaming of major TRW operations. TRW Space &amp;
Electronics in Redondo Beach will become Northrop Grumman Space
Technology.</TE>
<TE>   Kresa and Northrop President Ronald Sugar are scheduled to address
about 15,000 TRW employees Friday in Reston, Va., then fly back to
Southern California to speak to about 8,600 workers in Redondo Beach.
During what has been dubbed "Operation Day One," all TRW signs will
be replaced by Northrop markers.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Northrop gave Cleveland a farewell present as it
donated TRW's 68-acre headquarter campus to the Cleveland Clinic, a
nonprofit provider of medical services. The donation, which Northrop
will write off as a gift to charity, is estimated to be worth about
$60 million and represents one of the largest private gifts in the
city's history.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop closed down 12 cents Wednesday at $96.50 on the New York
Stock Exchange. And on its last day of trading, TRW ended down 19
cents at $51.62, also on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Crackdown Launched on Pirating</HD>

<LD>The recording industry is stepping up its anti-piracy efforts during
the holiday season, trying to clamp down on flea markets in Los
Angeles and New York as well as bootleggers at colleges and on the
Internet.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, representatives from six higher-education trade
associations have agreed to form task forces to study anti-piracy
policies and technologies. The groups will be advised by the
Recording Industry Assn. of America, the Motion Picture Assn. of
America and other copyright holders eager to stem the flow of pirated
material over high-speed college networks.</LD>
<LD>   The RIAA announced Wednesday a series of enforcement efforts,
including what it said was the largest seizure ever of CD-duplicating
equipment. The seizure, made Monday in Queens, N.Y., by the Secret
Service, disabled an operation that supplied an estimated 6 million
pirated CDs each year to bootleggers, the RIAA said.</LD>
<TE>   Additional targets include street vendors and other common outlets
for pirated CDs in New York and California, particularly those on
Santee Alley in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   As for online piracy, RIAA President Cary Sherman said the
organization is working more aggressively to block songs from being
distributed on the Internet before they're officially released.</TE>
<TE>   It also recently started sending more notices to colleges and
universities, asking them to stop specific users on campus from
pirating music on file-sharing networks, Sherman said.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, representatives of the six academic groups met with
the RIAA and the MPAA and agreed to form three task forces related to
intellectual property. In addition to recommending policies and
technologies to address piracy, representatives from colleges and
universities plan to start a dialogue with copyright holders on fair
use and other legal issues, Sherman said.</TE>

<HD>Playboy Will Enter Video Game Market</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Alex Pham</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Playboy Enterprises Inc. has linked with video game publisher Arush
Entertainment to produce the first mainstream title that features a
Playboy theme.</LD>
<LD>   The game, not due out until 2004, is expected to contain nudity.</LD>
<LD>   The companies are aiming for a "mature" rating that would allow
only consumers older than 17 to purchase the title, said Arush
spokesman Donald Case.</LD>
<TE>   Participants in the simulation game will play the role of Hugh
Hefner, founder of the adult entertainment company, in managing the
Playboy business.</TE>
<TE>   Arush, which produced "Duke Nuken: Manhattan Project," said it
would publish the Playboy game for the PC and consoles.</TE>
<TE>   The deal calls for Playboy to license its trademark and help
market the game in its magazines and on its Web site. It will not,
however, participate in developing the game or share ownership of the
title, Case said.</TE>
<TE>   "This deal marks Playboy's entry into the video game category and
is a significant breakthrough for us as we expand the licensing of
our brand in the entertainment arena," said Alex Vaickus, head of
Playboy's licensing arm.</TE>
<TE>   Playboy executives say the company is looking to become more
involved in producing games, particularly online games as well as
console games.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Cendant Executives Face New Charges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cendant Corp.'s former chairman, Walter Forbes, was indicted on
insider trading charges for allegedly selling more than $11 million
in company stock a month before accounting problems were disclosed at
the world's largest hotel franchiser.</LD>
<LD>   Forbes and former Vice Chairman E. Kirk Shelton, who had been
indicted twice before, were named in a new federal indictment
accusing them of additional securities fraud charges and lying to the
Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors allege that both men inflated revenue for a decade at
CUC Inc., which merged in December 1997 with HFS Inc. to create
Cendant. The company revealed accounting irregularities in April 1998
that triggered a $14-billion drop in market value in a single day.</LD>
<TE>   "Mr. Shelton vigorously denies all the charges against him," said
his attorney, Martin Auerbach. Forbes' attorney, Brendan Sullivan
Jr., did not return a call for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Cendant shares rose 3 cents to $12.11 on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines, said it secured a
Bankruptcy Court order to prevent holders of large stakes in the
airline from selling or transferring their holdings.</LD>
<LD>   The company said the order applies to entities that hold $65
million or more in claims against UAL or 2.5 million shares or more
of the company's stock.</LD>
<LD>   UAL said the court order, in effect until a Dec. 30 hearing to
reconsider its appropriateness, would help preserve its current
operating losses, a major asset in terms of tax benefits.</LD>

<LD>Chicago's Pritzker family may sell shares in its Hyatt Corp. hotel
company to the public and break up the rest of its $15-billion empire
to settle a financial dispute among family members, said a person
familiar with the situation.</LD>
<LD>   The Pritzkers decided last year to divide its investments after
some family members threatened lawsuits over control of Hyatt's vast
holdings, the person said. Actress Liesel Pritzker alleged in a
lawsuit last month that her father, Robert Pritzker, is depriving her
of a $1-billion inheritance.</LD>

<LD>Vivendi Universal may try to sell its $1-billion stake in EchoStar
Communications Corp. to trim debt after the U.S. satellite television
service provider abandoned plans to buy a rival, investors said.</LD>
<LD>   EchoStar dropped its $27-billion proposed purchase of Hughes
Electronics Corp. on Tuesday amid opposition from regulators. That
leaves aVivendi free to shed the 10% of EchoStar it bought in
January.</LD>
<LD>   The terms of the EchoStar accord kept Vivendi from selling its
stake until regulators either cleared or blocked the company's
planned purchase of Hughes, according to filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.</LD>

<LD>A federal appeals court threw out the tobacco industry's lawsuit
challenging the landmark 1993 government finding that secondhand
tobacco smoke increases the risk of cancer.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously ruled that the
Environmental Protection Agency's report on secondhand smoke was not
subject to court review because it was advisory and not a final
agency action.</LD>
<LD>   The tobacco companies are expected to appeal to the Supreme Court.</LD>

<LD>Raytheon Co.'s chief financial officer, Frank Caine, resigned weeks
after being sanctioned by regulators. The company said Edward Pliner
would replace Caine, who had been with Raytheon since 1999. Pliner,
44, has been Raytheon's corporate controller since April 2000.</LD>
<LD>   The Securities and Exchange Commission sanctioned Raytheon and
Caine in November for allegedly violating its fair-disclosure rule,
which is designed to keep companies from giving important information
to analysts and big investors before alerting the public. Raytheon
did not admit wrongdoing but agreed to refrain from violating the
rule in the future.</LD>
<LD>   Raytheon shares rose $1.20 to $29.72 on the NYSE.</LD>

<HD>Tenet's Aggressive Corporate Culture Fed Crisis, Insiders
Say</HD>
<DH>The hospital operator's business practices, profit-based
pay incentives come under scrutiny</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Lee</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last February, more than 1,000 Tenet Healthcare Corp. employees from
around the country gathered in Las Vegas to talk about Target 100,
the hospital company's quality excellence program. But to some
participants, the three-day affair at Caesars Palace felt more like
an overwrought company bash.</LD>
<LD>   Speakers dressed up as Dr. Seuss characters. Tenet Chief Executive
Jeffrey C. Barbakow, wearing a big red-and-white-striped hat,
addressed the group as mayor of Tenetville, and souvenir dolls of him
in the role were passed out. Senior executives rode around in
decorated golf carts, and some emerged on stage as if riding
Harley-Davidsons. Lip-sync artists danced to Beatles' tunes.</LD>
<LD>   It was an extravaganza befitting Vegas, and it spoke volumes about
the prosperity and culture at the nation's No. 2 hospital chain, now
under intense government scrutiny. Tenet executives said the Las
Vegas conference was a relatively cheap way to celebrate a highly
successful program. Still, in the staid and budget-conscious hospital
industry, Tenet was accustomed to pushing the envelope.</LD>
<TE>   Even among for-profit hospital operators, the Santa Barbara-based
company led the pack, not only with programs such as Target 100 but
also in the way it raised hospital charges, rewarded hospital
executives with bonuses that matched their annual salary and went
after high-profit lines of medical services.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Tenet's aggressive business practices have come to light
in recent weeks, as Tenet's stock has wilted amid an audit by
Medicare regulators and an FBI investigation of two doctors at a
Tenet hospital in Redding.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout, Barbakow has maintained that Tenet did nothing
illegal, and he has blamed the company's woes largely on a few
individuals. Barbakow, 58, was brought in a decade ago to restore the
company after a scandal involving its psychiatric hospitals. One of
his first acts was to establish a tough ethics program for employees,
which he said remains in place today.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, some Tenet insiders and analysts think that the makings
of the company's current crisis stem from an aggressive corporate
culture, fostered at the top, that encouraged hospital managers and
others to push short-term profits to the hilt.</TE>
<TE>   One prime example is how executives are paid. In Tenet's last
fiscal year, chief executives of the company's 113 hospitals in the
U.S. had an average salary of $200,000. But collectively, the company
confirmed, they doubled their pay with cash bonuses, mostly for
boosting their hospital's earnings. And that doesn't include stock
options.</TE>
<TE>   Major nonprofit hospitals, including Sutter Health and Catholic
Healthcare West in California, generally limit incentive pay to 20%
to 35% of base salary -- and growth in net income usually isn't a
factor, although making budgetary goals is. At other investor-owned
hospitals, cash bonuses can run 50% to 70% of base salary, according
to recruiting firm Korn/Ferry International.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet's biggest national rival and the country's largest hospital
chain, for-profit HCA Inc., said bonuses for its hospital CEOs are
only in stock options. HCA spokesman Jeff Prescott said the
Nashville-based company eliminated cash bonuses in 1997, shortly
after it became embroiled in a massive Medicare fraud investigation.
"We wanted to get rid of short-term profit incentives," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet executives said their big bonuses last year reflected the
corporation's 51% jump in earnings, which the company has
acknowledged were driven in good part by outsize Medicare revenue
generated by rapidly raising its hospitals' list prices.</TE>
<TE>   Alan R. Ewalt, Tenet's longtime head of human resources, said the
company's target bonus for hospital CEOs is 36% of salary and based
mainly on two factors: meeting budget and measures of patient
satisfaction. But they could enhance cash bonuses by raising their
hospital's operating income, with no limit to this extra income.</TE>
<TE>   "The incentive plan is designed to encourage CEOs to make sure to
meet business goals and get a good return to add additional capital,"
Ewalt said.</TE>
<TE>   And did this bonus plan put undue pressure on executives to raise
their hospital charges and take other aggressive actions? "We're
going to do a review," Ewalt said, "to see if there are those
relationships."</TE>
<TE>   A number of Tenet hospital CEOs contacted for this story declined
to comment or did not return telephone calls. In one interview
arranged by Tenet, Michael Rembis, chief executive at Centinela
Hospital Medical Center in Inglewood, distinguished between focusing
on profit and growing the business, which he said he does. That means
expanding hospital services, increasing admissions and taking care of
patients.</TE>
<TE>   "Even when we didn't hit monthly targets, the company did not put
a lot of pressure on me," said Rembis, a 20-year health-care veteran.
"I've never been asked whether we met our returns on investment," he
added, noting that Tenet has put $52 million into the facility since
1997, including building a heart center.</TE>
<TE>   Centinela, a 371-bed hospital in a lower-income community, has
been one of Tenet's more profitable hospitals, based on state
filings. The hospital's pretax net income was $64.2 million for the
year ended June 30, up 25% from the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   But Centinela's earnings in the last two years got a notable lift
from special Medicare "outlier" payments, which are made in addition
to regular fixed reimbursements and are intended to help hospitals
cover the costs of complicated cases. Medicare calculates outliers by
comparing a hospital's costs with the list charges of a patient's
case.</TE>
<TE>   As Tenet came under fire from regulators in recent weeks, the
company disclosed that aggressive increases in hospital charges
produced unusually large outlier payments. Medicare's top official
has accused Tenet of inappropriately gaming the system.</TE>
<TE>   Rembis, who has run Centinela since 1999, was aware his hospital
received a larger share of outlier payments than some others. But he
said he had no idea how much that affected the hospital's bottom line
and that directions on raising hospital charges came from corporate
headquarters. He declined to be more specific, nor would he discuss
his salary and bonus.</TE>
<TE>   Some current and former Tenet hospital managers painted a
different picture of the financial pressures. One former senior
executive of a Tenet hospital said that corporate expectations to
grow earnings were intense, and that failure to make budget goals was
sometimes met with a grilling at monthly meetings. Hitting financial
targets, a current Tenet executive said, was "how you were judged,
paid and evaluated."</TE>
<TE>   Tenet's strategy of aggressively increasing hospital charges was
aimed partly at bolstering revenue from health insurers. Like
Medicare, insurers generally pay Tenet hospitals not only a fixed
rate but also extra sums for costly cases, called stop-loss payments,
based on a percentage of hospital charges.</TE>
<TE>   This strategy "reflects a very short-term thinking of maximizing a
revenue draw and not giving consideration to long-term
ramifications," said Tim Moran, chief executive of nonprofit Mercy
Hospital in Bakersfield and a longtime Tenet employee who left in
1994.</TE>
<TE>   In Moran's view, as well as that of some doctors and analysts,
Tenet's business model may have encouraged hospitals to practice more
aggressive medicine. If hospitals are paid a flat fixed rate, they
argue, they will have incentives to manage care more carefully. But
if hospitals know they are going to get paid a percentage of each
procedure because the case has qualified for Medicare outlier or
stop-loss payments, hospitals are likely to be less concerned
financially about ordering additional tests and procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Barbakow has said Tenet went too far in raising hospital charges
that inflated Medicare revenue. This month, he ordered a freeze in
hospital charges and said uninsured patients would receive
substantial discounts. In addition, he said Tenet would move away
from relying on insurance payments based on hospital charges.</TE>
<TE>   But in a recent interview, Barbakow suggested that Tenet's
problems were not indicative of an aggressive business culture but
stemmed largely from a failure of communication. "Certain individuals
were doing things and not passing along" the information, he said.
Among them, he has indicated, were Thomas B. Mackey, Tenet's chief
operating officer, and David L. Dennis, chief financial officer, who
were dismissed last month. Neither responded to requests for comment.</TE>
<TE>   A month before leaving, Mackey exercised $10 million in Tenet
stock options. Barbakow this year cashed in stock options worth $111
million, on top of his $5.5-million salary and bonus for fiscal 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Several Wall Street analysts have criticized Barbakow's
compensation, saying that itself was a statement of the company's
values. "When you pay the CEO so much money, you're saying, 'That's
the game. Make as much money as you can,' " said Clifford Hewitt, a
health-care analyst at Legg Mason. "At some point there's a spillover
effect. We can't calculate it, but this kind of excess ... gets
reflected somewhere in the behavior of the organization."</TE>
<TE>   This month, Barbakow said his compensation, like many other things
at the company, were on the table. "If we find that our incentives
aren't aligned in the proper way, we will address it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Jorgensen, senior vice president of Tenet's ethics,
business conduct and administration, said what's happened in the last
two months has caused a lot of frustration and anger among employees.</TE>
<TE>   "They know this is not a true reflection of the culture of this
company," he said. "I think it's going to be a challenge ... to
reestablish the reputation and trust we have."</TE>

<HD>Pacific Theatres Expected to Acquire Grove Cinemas</HD>
<DH>The chain would pay about $30 million for the successful
multiplex, sources say.</DH>

<LD>A big screen is fetching big bucks.</LD>
<LD>   Pacific Theatres Corp. is close to buying the Grove theater
complex, one of the Los Angeles area's top-grossing movie houses, for
about $30 million, according to people familiar with the deal.</LD>
<LD>   The sale of the 14-screen multiplex, which is located at the Grove
retail center in Los Angeles' Fairfax District, represents one of the
highest per-screen prices -- about $2.1 million apiece -- ever paid
for a movie theater, according to industry observers. Los
Angeles-based Pacific Theatres is scheduled to complete the purchase
from developer Rick Caruso today.</LD>
<TE>   "It's been an incredibly successful theater," said Greg Laemmle,
vice president of Laemmle Theatres, a Los Angeles-based art house
chain. "It's perfectly located in the middle of town with all the
amenities that people want."</TE>
<TE>   The 10-month-old Grove cinemas, which feature an opulent Art
Deco-style lobby and 3,000 stadium-style seats, have benefited
greatly from their location in the heart of the Grove, a
450,000-square-foot open-air center built by Caruso's company, Caruso
Affiliated Holdings.</TE>
<TE>   "The Grove has a been a strong performer almost out of the box,"
said retail industry consultant Rob York at Fransen Co. As a result,
the theater "has put pressure on some of the older theaters in that
part of Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Executives at Pacific Theatres and Caruso Affiliated Holdings
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso's initial plans for the Grove, unveiled three years ago,
included Pacific Theatres' concept for a high-tech, luxury cinema
called ArcLight.</TE>
<TE>   But Pacific instead built the first ArcLight in a new complex that
surrounds the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood. The firm operates the Grove
theater under a management contract with Caruso, who had always
planned to sell the theater building once it was up and running.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific had to compete against other large movie-chain operators,
including AMC Entertainment Inc., to buy the complex, said people
familiar with the process. Executives at AMC would not comment.</TE>
<TE>   Owning such a high-grossing and high-profile location would give
the family-owned company -- a relatively small regional chain with
about two dozen multiplexes in California -- much more clout with
movie distributors, according to industry observers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really great to be the exhibitor who delivers that theater,"
Laemmle said.</TE>
<TE>   The Grove and ArcLight theaters are part of a new generation of
luxury movie houses that charge a premium price -- as much as $11.75
and $14, respectively -- for more-comfortable seating and service as
well as top-notch sound and projection systems.</TE>
<TE>   "They are the state of the art, and people in this town really
respond to that," said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor
Relations, which tracks box-office results.</TE>

<HD>IRS Moves to Clarify Rules on Tax Cheats</HD>
<DH>Agency won't guarantee immunity, but prosecution is
unlikely if scofflaws come clean.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathy M. Kristof</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Internal Revenue Service, in a continuing effort to beat the
bushes for tax scofflaws, on Wednesday revamped its so-called
voluntary disclosure practices.</LD>
<LD>   The new rules, which will be written into IRS procedure manuals,
clarify that the IRS will go easy on certain tax cheats as long as
they come clean before the agency starts after them.</LD>
<LD>   The move is significant, tax attorneys said, particularly in light
of the agency's continued push to find and prosecute Americans who
have used offshore accounts, questionable trusts and complicated
shelters to hide income or underpay their taxes.</LD>
<TE>   "People want to come out of the woodwork," said Martin Laffer,
partner at the Beverly Hills tax law firm of Laffer &amp; Gottlieb. "We
see people approach the problem, wanting to know how to come clean
without going to prison or being killed with fraud penalties. A lot
of them have decided not to do it, because the voluntary disclosure
rules were so nebulous that they couldn't be sure what would happen."</TE>
<TE>   The rules have particular significance in Los Angeles, long
believed to be a hotbed of tax cheats, said Elliott Kajan, partner
with Kajan Mather &amp; Barish in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   "L.A. has always had more tax shelters and more tax-advantaged
investment programs than any other city in the country," he said. "It
seemed to be the hub, and the spokes went out all over the state."</TE>
<TE>   In three pages of guidance, the IRS said it would not
automatically guarantee immunity from prosecution or penalties, but
the agency probably would not recommend prosecution when taxpayers
come forward with truthful, timely and complete information about
transgressions. Taxpayers also must be willing to pay any tax,
interest and penalties "determined by the IRS to be applicable."</TE>
<TE>   "This is very good," Kajan said, about the wording of the section
on penalties. "It shows me they are willing to talk about waiving
penalties. I'd say this is as close to an amnesty program as they're
going to get."</TE>
<TE>   However, the agency said it will not consider letters from
lawyers, who wish to keep their clients anonymous, to be valid
voluntary disclosures. And it's not interested in giving breaks to
taxpayers already under grand jury investigation, IRS examination or
who have participated in illegal activities to generate their taxable
income.</TE>

<HD>He's Humble in a Way That Only Godzilla Could Be</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Arianna Huffington</AU>
<BD>Arianna Huffington writes a syndicated column. E-mail:
arianna@ariannaonline.com</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Remember how the Bush administration ambled unassumingly into office?
"I hope I'm viewed as a humble person," the president said just
before moving into the White House. And on his first day on the job,
he counseled his senior staff members to "be an example of humility
and decency and fairness."</LD>
<LD>   Well, those days are long gone. Forget tiptoeing. Team Bush now
stomps down the halls of power like Godzilla trampling the streets of
Tokyo. When describing the administration at midterm, the words that
come to mind are arrogant, cocky, galling and drunk with power. The
prevailing motto seems to be: "Our way or the highway. If you don't
like it, you can move to Canada."</LD>
<LD>   The latest example was the stunning appointment of cover-up cover
boy Henry Kissinger to head the 9/11 commission. Was Bush
deliberately trying to select the one person in the world least
likely to get to the bottom of the foul-ups that preceded Sept. 11?
Was Saudi Prince Bandar too busy reining in his wife's charitable
impulses to take the job?</LD>
<TE>   The only thing more ludicrous than naming Kissinger to head this
inquiry would be picking somebody who thinks "pollution is a right"
to head the Interior Department, or selecting a guy who made his name
fighting the authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission as
its chairman. Oh, wait a minute -- that's right, Bush already did
both of those things too.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few months alone, the White House has shown its
disdain for public opinion -- and indeed the public interest -- in an
exceptionally wide variety of areas. Here are just a few of the more
blood-boiling cases.</TE>
<TE>   * On the environment: Not satisfied with just gutting the Clean
Air Act, the White House chose to announce its polluter-friendly
decision in the most dismissive, least accountable way possible,
delivered not by the president or Environmental Protection Agency
head Christie Whitman but by a low-level administrator, on a Friday
afternoon leading into a holiday week and with no cameras allowed. *
On stealing from the poor to give to the rich: In an act of reverse
Robin Hood effrontery, the president helped defray some of the cost
of his nonstop campaigning with an accounting trick that allowed him
to dip into the coffers of the Office of Family Assistance by
piggy-backing campaign appearances onto trips ostensibly made to talk
about welfare reform. That's right, money meant to assist poor
families was used to help elect politicians who believe that, even
with all the problems facing this country, cutting taxes for the rich
should be job one.</TE>
<TE>   These, of course, are the same Scrooges who did nothing to stop
the unemployment benefits of 800,000 workers from expiring during the
holiday season. Ho, ho, ho, poor people!</TE>
<TE>   * On sucking up to special interests: I guess that the
back-channel passage of that tailor-made -- and White House- approved
-- homeland security bill amendment protecting Eli Lilly, maker of
the questionable vaccine preservative thimerosal, from billions in
potential lawsuits just wasn't enough of an insult to democracy. To
pour salt in that fresh wound the administration has asked a federal
claims court to block public access to documents unearthed in more
than 1,000 thimerosal- related lawsuits. Take that, suffering parents
of autistic children!</TE>
<TE>   * On political patronage: As the White House was moving to scale
back pay increases for career federal employees it was also secretly
doling out big-buck bonuses to political appointees -- a practice
banned during the Clinton presidency because of abuses during the
last Bush administration. Who was it again who was going to restore
integrity to the White House?</TE>
<TE>   * On fighting the war on terrorism: A majority of Americans have a
negative view of Saudi Arabia. As well they should, given the desert
kingdom's two-faced attitude, the money that ended up in the pockets
of 9/11 hijackers, its telethons for suicide bombers, its refusal to
let U.S. planes targeting the Taliban take off from Saudi soil and
the not-insignificant fact that most of the 9/11 hijackers were
Saudi. In spite of all this, the White House continues to treat the
spoiled princes of the House of Saud as bosom brothers. In your eye,
American people!</TE>

<HD>A Plan for Prevention or Provocation?</HD>
<DH>Threatening a cornered and desperate Hussein would be a
dangerous strategy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rajan Menon</AU>
<BD>Rajan Menon is a senior fellow at the Council on
Foreign Relations and professor of international relations at Lehigh
University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: What does a murderous tyrant who has proved time and again
that he cares not a whit for human life do when he knows he's done
for? Answer: Go out in a blaze of glory, inflicting as much harm as
possible on his enemies.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration is right to worry that such apocalyptic
logic might appeal to Saddam Hussein if the U.S. invades Iraq. After
all, Hussein is not just coldblooded; he's a megalomaniac who just
might conclude that a fiery end would immortalize him in Arab minds.</LD>
<LD>   To guard against such contingencies, the White House has codified
the administration's post-Sept. 11 reassessment of the threat posed
by weapons of mass destruction. At the core of the new approach is a
dire warning: The United States will "resort to all our options"
against those who use such weapons against us or our friends. It's
pretty clear whom the message is intended for.</LD>
<TE>   There's one problem, though: This strategy makes no sense given
the (accurate) portrait the White House and the Pentagon have painted
of Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's case for war against Iraq is that Hussein
cannot be allowed to acquire nuclear, chemical or biological weapons
because the laws of deterrence don't apply to him. He's too ruthless
and unpredictable; threatening him with retaliation if he uses such
weapons would be useless.</TE>
<TE>   But if Hussein can't be deterred when he has everything to lose --
his regime, army, all those palaces and portraits -- why would he
hesitate to roll the dice when he knows he's finished? That's when
his immunity to deterrence becomes a real problem.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of a martyr's death that consumes as many American
soldiers as possible may appeal to the grandiosity of this
semiliterate thug who craves fame like that of Saladin, the Kurdish
fighter born in his hometown of Tikrit who defeated the Crusaders in
the 12th century.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine a scenario that is plausible, even likely: American forces
sweep into Iraq after withering attacks from the air and sea have
eviscerated Hussein's armor, aircraft, air defense systems and
command and control centers. The American commanders seal off Baghdad
and Tikrit, and U.S. troops are on the hunt for Hussein. The Kurds in
the north and the Shiites in the south see the regime tottering.
Bigwigs in Iraq's ruling Baath Party, intelligence services and
military are cutting deals with the Americans to save their skins.
Hussein knows he's finished. But the cagey guy has managed to
squirrel away a cache of weapons of mass destruction. How likely is
it that he will flinch for fear that the U.S. would retaliate and
inflict great suffering on ordinary Iraqis in the process? If Hussein
can't be deterred from using these weapons when he has much to lose,
why would he hesitate when he has nothing to lose?</TE>
<TE>   On the basis of what the administration itself has told us about
Hussein's mentality, the answer is pretty clear.</TE>
<TE>   A first strike wouldn't solve this problem because of the chaos of
war and the ample opportunities for concealing weapons of mass
destruction in a place as big as Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Does the policy of "regime change" mean that we may be sending our
troops into a chemical, biological or nuclear battlefield? How many
Iraqi civilians would perish if Hussein used such weapons? Would
Arabs blame Hussein for those deaths or the U.S., on the grounds that
it began the war? Would Americans strongly support war against Iraq
if Hussein's doomsday scenario were more widely discussed? It's not
enough to simply pose such questions. Critics of regime change must
also explain what they would do should Hussein's possession of these
weapons be confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   There is a way to do that without falling back on the unrealistic
and irresponsible no-war-at-any-cost mantra.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. should declare that it will immediately destroy all
facilities that make, store and target such weapons once it learns,
at any point, that Iraq is manufacturing them. It should pledge that
an attack by Hussein on his neighbors, with conventional or nuclear
weapons, will be equivalent to a war on the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   While weapons inspections are continuing, the U.S. should seek
Security Council approval for this policy as a condition for
abandoning regime change. This approach would clear Iraq of weapons
of mass destruction -- without our troops, citizens and friends
risking an encounter with Hussein's deadly toys.</TE>

<HD>Water Crisis Is Brewing, and the Colorado River Runs
Through It</HD>
<DH>Imperial Valley had good cause to reject flawed plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Antonio Rossmann</AU>
<BD>Antonio Rossmann teaches water law at UC Berkeley's
Boalt Hall and represents Imperial County in connection with the
proposed San Diego transfer.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Late Monday night, the Imperial Irrigation District defiantly
rejected a proposed 75-year water sale to San Diego over the strong
objections of the federal government. By the next morning, furious
federal and state officials were already threatening to cut the
state's water allotment dramatically.</LD>
<LD>   This reaction was not justified. A transfer benefiting the rural
valley and coastal city can still be attained, but patience and
empathy are required.</LD>
<LD>   The district's critics accuse it of casually ignoring the
threatened reduction of urban California's Colorado River supply if
the deal is not completed by Dec. 31. That charge is unfounded. The
3-2 vote bespeaks the hard choice facing Imperial Valley. Nor can the
district's decision be labeled irresponsible. Despite displays of
good faith and imagination by virtually all the participants, the
Imperial Valley's fears are well founded.</LD>
<TE>   The deal initially negotiated in 1998 by Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt and the Colorado River water users did not account for the
transfer's effect on the Salton Sea, which could be harmed by a
reduction in agricultural runoff from the Imperial Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The 2002 revision emerging from the state Legislature and State
Water Board maintained the sea for only 15 years. The actual 75-year
transfer, however, would destroy an important habitat for endangered
birds and fish and create a serious air pollution threat. To avoid
those consequences would require the permanent retirement of
productive farmland. The rural citizenry rightfully abhorred being
forced to choose between its future environment and its economy.</TE>
<TE>   Urban water consumers -- and Washington and Sacramento politicians
-- must respect the Imperial Valley's well-founded fears. Moreover,
we must all respect the valley's agricultural heritage. In becoming
our nation's principal source of winter fruits and vegetables, the
district's irrigated agriculture was created not by federal or state
government but by pioneer families whose initiative and risk-taking
turned the Colorado River to this productive use.</TE>
<TE>   What can now be done?</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis and water officials still hope to broker a
permanent deal by the Dec. 31 deadline. But such a quick fix probably
is not possible. The Babbitt-sponsored agreement that quantifies how
California may use the Colorado River must be reopened to include a
permanent restoration of the Salton Sea. All California users,
particularly those in the Coachella Valley, must lower their pre-2002
expectations for expanded water deliveries.</TE>
<TE>   Our sister Colorado River states, with rightful claims that
California confine its use to legal apportionment, must respect the
sincere effort of all California agencies to reduce our draw on the
Colorado River. But the greatest statesmanship must now emerge from
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   To date, Assistant Secretary of Interior Bennett Raley has chided
and threatened California. His boss, the Interior secretary, is water
master of the Lower Colorado and indeed has power to punish
California -- but shouldn't.</TE>
<TE>   Though the department is quick to remind us of our failure to live
within our apportionment, it blatantly ignores its own missed
congressional deadline for producing a Salton Sea restoration plan
and protecting air quality at the sea and its responsibility to
enforce Endangered Species Act compliance. Babbitt created the
December 2002 deadline premised on a flawed plan; Interior Secretary
Gale Norton must extend that deadline to correct the error she
inherited. Norton should stop threatening and start cooperating in
our common goal to find permanent peace on the river.</TE>

<HD>It's Not Paranoia: Be Very Afraid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Norah Vincent</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a writer and a senior fellow at the
Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a think tank that studies
terrorism. Web site: www.norahvincent .com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The war on terror is a ploy. It's not real. It's not necessary. It's
just a horror show meant to keep us all cowed and passive while the
government has its way. The Bush administration keeps us quaking in
our slippers, issuing periodic vague alerts as an elaborate
justification for its agenda of plundering the environment,
demonizing nonwhite undesirables, quashing our civil liberties and
attacking foreign countries with impunity.</LD>
<LD>   This is a view that many people, including certain prominent
intellectuals and Hollywood yahoos, appear to share: We live in a
culture of fear, for no apparent reason except that Big Brother wants
it that way.</LD>
<LD>   This came up recently at a dinner party I attended, where the
prevailing view around the table seemed to be that this cartoon
worldview as depicted in provocateur Michael Moore's film "Bowling
for Columbine" was right.</LD>
<TE>   "Why are we so afraid?" my companions asked. This struck me as an
astounding question to pose in a post-Sept. 11 world, but one I
nonetheless took seriously because these were intelligent, thoughtful
people.</TE>
<TE>   When I said the painfully obvious -- that we're afraid because
little more than a year ago terrorists attacked us catastrophically
on our own soil and that we're afraid because, duh, that's why they
call it terrorism -- I was greeted by a series of incredulous "yeah
buts."</TE>
<TE>   Then it occurred to me that the problem wasn't that these people
weren't aware of a terrorist threat, but that they didn't really
believe in it anymore. Or that, like communism, it had become an
amorphous chimera whose danger they doubted. They had forgotten what
exactly about this new form of terrorism was so terrifying.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe they need to be reminded. Maybe we all do.</TE>
<TE>   Islamist terror should scare us for very good reasons, the primary
one being that it is genocidal and not preventable, a lethal
combination. Al Qaeda is bent on annihilating us (the Western
infidels), and it is very close to having the means to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Captured videos show Al Qaeda operatives testing poison gas on
dogs. We know that Osama bin Laden has tried to buy nuclear material
on the black market. Though our enemies have obtained such weapons in
the past, none before has been in a position to use them without
facing retaliation. Mutually assured destruction has always been a
deterrent to rogue nations.</TE>
<TE>   Not so Al Qaeda because its members are blithely homicidal (they
do not spare civilians, even their own) as well as suicidal. More
important, they no longer are state-sponsored. They are widely
dispersed, largely untraceable and therefore, as an entity, mostly
unpunishable and possibly even unstoppable.</TE>
<TE>   The danger is apocalyptic. What's more, it's insidious and
ubiquitous. The terrorist diaspora has spread across the world in
covert cells from Indonesia, Central Asia, East Africa and the
Arabian Peninsula to Lackawanna, N.Y., where authorities arrested six
suspected Al Qaeda operatives in September. They are indeed
everywhere, around us and among us, striking randomly in New York
City, Washington, Bali, Yemen, Kenya, Kuwait and Afghanistan and
vowing more to come.</TE>
<TE>   Is this fantasy? Is this paranoia? Hardly. Casualties are mounting
on all sides, the enemy is invisible and we are the big fat
designated target with nowhere to hide. I'd say we have cause to be
very nervous.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the Cold War. It's far worse. Yet leftists are
approaching it in the same spirit of insouciant denial with which
they once dismissed the threat of communist spies in our midst.</TE>
<TE>   As access to Soviet archives has shown, they were wrong then. And
they're wrong now. The evidence is in the rubble and the bodies.</TE>

<HD>Airline Safety Isn't Optional</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When it comes to keeping terrorists off airplanes, pilots have
near-dictatorial power to follow their instincts. Why second-guess
them in equally grave safety emergencies? That's one unanswered
question in a scathing report issued Tuesday on the crash nearly
three years ago of a twin-engine Alaska Airlines jet off the Ventura
County coast that killed 88 people.</LD>
<LD>   The report by the National Transportation Safety Board showed
precisely how shoddy maintenance and lax regulation contributed to
the crash. Clearly, concrete corrective steps on those points are
due, but Alaska Airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration have
been reacting to the report with inexcusable evasion.</LD>
<LD>   The airline said that though it agreed with many of the board's
findings, it "respectfully questions" others. It did not specify
which safety fixes it disagreed with, insisting "this is a time to
move on." On the contrary. Now is the time for the airline to either
explain its objections candidly or comply fully with the board's
recommendations. The airline also should let the world know why its
ground personnel initially pressured the captain not to make an
emergency landing in the Los Angeles area and instead to continue
flying toward San Francisco.</LD>
<TE>   The crew had struggled with an erratic horizontal stabilizer, a
tail surface that controls the up-and-down movement of the nose,
since shortly after taking off from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, en route
to San Francisco. The NTSB concluded that the stabilizer failed
because one of its large, threaded bolts had not been lubricated in
months, after the FAA allowed Alaska to extend the lubricating
intervals.</TE>
<TE>   The cockpit voice recorder showed that when the pilot asked for
permission to land in the L.A. area, he was rebuffed at least twice.
First, an Alaska Airlines dispatcher in Seattle told him there might
be problems getting the plane back into the air if it was diverted to
Los Angeles International Airport -- applying the kind of pressure
that the captain said "just drives me nuts." At another point, an air
traffic controller told the crew the plane might have trouble getting
permission to land in Los Angeles because the flight was
international and thus required Customs Service approval for landing.</TE>
<TE>   For its part, the FAA should stop reflexively defending itself and
take action. Though the FAA and Alaska say the airline's maintenance
program has improved since the Jan. 31, 2000, disaster, the safety
board uncovered maintenance failures this spring similar to the ones
that led to the crash. In particular, the FAA should require better
procedures for lubricating the tail bolts and take more control away
from the airlines regarding maintenance intervals. The FAA should
also order another major inspection of Alaska's maintenance
operations.</TE>
<TE>   Some officials at the FAA and NTSB say the airline industry, in
financial peril since 9/11, can't afford to implement new and
nettlesome inspections. That argument doesn't fly. There should be no
debate about the need to put passenger safety first.</TE>

<LD>Stephen Friedman has found himself in the line of fire. Hard-line
conservative activists have ginned up an attack that's delayed his
appointment as President Bush's top economic advisor. They complain,
in effect, that Friedman, a staunch Republican, won't pass their
"litmus test" of devotion to tax cuts. But it is Friedman's
opposition to big federal deficits that true fiscal conservatives
will support and that makes him a good man to have around as the
economy stumbles and a costly war with Iraq looms.</LD>
<LD>   Friedman has incurred this wrath because he was director of the
Concord Coalition, a bipartisan organization intent on curbing the
federal budget deficit. He gets more bad marks for having run the
Goldman Sachs investment firm from 1990 to '92 with Robert E. Rubin,
who went on to be President Clinton's Treasury secretary.</LD>
<LD>   Yet it was Rubin's policy of slashing debt and his willingness to
support tight spending and higher taxes that helped create a
prosperous economy and allowed President Bush to point to budget
surpluses to justify his 10-year, $1.35-trillion tax cut.</LD>
<TE>   To opponents, though, Friedman's record makes him a dangerous
Trojan horse for anti-tax-cutting policies. "DUMP Friedman! He's no
tax-cutter," declared National Review Online. Stephen Moore, head of
the free-market Club for Growth, complained that there's no sign
Friedman "has a supply-side bone in his body." Moore and others
worship supply-side economics -- the Reagan-era belief that cutting
taxes miraculously pays for itself. The idea is that the lower taxes
go, the more people invest. The result is supposed to be that the
government ends up collecting more revenue overall because the
economy has expanded. But the massive deficits the Reagan
administration created, as it slashed taxes and increased military
spending, showed that supply-side economics is a triumph of hope over
experience.</TE>
<TE>   Like the successful Rubin, Wall Street's Friedman is hardly a
Marxist lackey. It's unlikely that Friedman could persuade the
president to end his deep embrace of tax cuts, although he might
temper the worst excesses.</TE>
<TE>   Dumping Friedman would show only that the administration fears a
powerful Republican constituency more than a faltering economy; the
White House wisely has indicated that it's going to give Friedman the
nod despite the carping. We hope that despite all this posturing the
White House remembers that real fiscal conservatives hate spiraling
debt.</TE>

<HD>Yemen's Troubling Scuds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's difficult to know why Yemen felt it needed Scud missiles. It has
quarreled with its northern neighbor, Saudi Arabia, over the years,
but last year the two countries seemed to have patched up their
border dispute. Even if the missiles bought from North Korea make
Yemen feel more secure, the country's history as a haven for Al Qaeda
members and launching pad for anti-Western violence raises fears that
the weapons could fall into the hands of terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   The terror connection is what set bells clanging upon the
discovery of more than a dozen Scud missiles aboard a ship flying no
nation's flag in the Arabian Sea, apparently headed for impoverished
Yemen. More alarming, the ship had sailed from North Korea, a
longtime global arms seller that recently acknowledged having a
nuclear weapons development program.</LD>
<LD>   The United States apparently tracked the Scuds from the start;
Spanish ships on anti-terror patrol in Middle Eastern waters stopped
the freighter Tuesday and discovered the missiles hidden beneath a
load of cement. Yemen's official news agency said the president of
Yemen called Vice President Dick Cheney and the weapons eventually
were delivered. White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said there was no
provision under international law to stop the missile delivery. Score
one for unregulated international arms trade.</LD>
<TE>   The single good outcome in this case is that it puts rogue states
like North Korea on notice that the United States is at least closely
tracking such weapon movements.</TE>
<TE>   There is no evidence that Yemen itself provided arms to terrorists
in the past, although the country is known as a transit point for
weapons, money and soldiers of fortune. The main port, Aden, was the
site of the October 2000 attack on the U.S. destroyer Cole that
killed 17 U.S. sailors and nearly sank the warship. In a similar
attack this year on a French tanker, a boatload of explosives was
driven into the vessel's side.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials bitterly criticized Yemen for lack of cooperation
in investigating the Cole bombing, but after Sept. 11, 2001, Yemen
helped in the search for terrorists' money and in seeking
individuals. Last month, a missile fired from an unmanned CIA plane
over Yemen killed six suspected Al Qaeda operatives, including one of
the group's most senior people. In addition, U.S. soldiers have
trained Yemeni soldiers in counter-terrorism tactics.</TE>
<TE>   Making the Scud deal more troublesome is what defense officials
said was Yemen's earlier promise to Washington that it would stop
making such purchases from North Korea. The United States has heard
enough broken promises; Yemen should realize it is better off being
Washington's partner in the fight against Al Qaeda than North Korea's
customer for weapons that could destabilize the region.</TE>

<LD>Samuel Phipps' Dec. 8 letter contains the phrase, "as long as people

suppression when it comes to addressing the gang problem.</LD>
<LD>   He has, in fact, stated recently that there is a need for more of
a police presence in gang-affected communities.</LD>
<LD>   To suggest that Father Greg "coddles" gang members simply displays

<HD>Former High Fliers Fall With Deregulation</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "High Price for Deregulation," Commentary, Dec. 8: I'm old enough
to remember air travel before deregulation. Back then, one airline's
ad campaign said, "Getting there is half the fun." After
deregulation, civilian air travel slowly became more and more like
ancient Chinese water torture, or the famous "death by a thousand
cuts." And while on the subject, it would be well to remember the
other fruits of deregulation, i.e., the savings and loan debacle of
the 1980s and the power blackouts and skyrocketing energy costs after
the electric and gas utilities were deregulated. And we mustn't
forget the piece de resistance -- the deregulation of the banking
industry in 1996. The chickens still haven't come home to roost on
that.</LD>

<TE>   Back in the '60s, when the airline ticket prices were controlled
by the Civil Aeronautics Board, I can't remember any major airline
going broke. Since then we've lost Pan American World Airways, TWA,
Eastern and others. Now our largest, United Airlines, is filing for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy (Dec. 10). Airline price wars have made most of
them unprofitable, to the detriment of our safety, not to mention the
losses in stockholders' value. Perhaps deregulation is not such a
good idea after all, especially when it comes to passenger safety.</TE>

<LD>I was totally disgusted as I read "Embezzler Repays Victims, Avoids
Jail" (Dec. 5), about the criminal acts of disbarred attorney
Cristeta Paguirigan -- embezzlement, stealing from elderly clients,
forgery, bouncing checks and her other unethical behavior. I am
sickened and outraged that this criminal is working as a "litigation
specialist" for the city of South Gate at $200 an hour, racking up
$350,000 in income over the last 12 months, which is far more than
most hard-working, ethical, licensed attorneys earn. Why is this not
seen as a disbarred attorney practicing law without a license? And
why does the city of South Gate continue to employ her at exorbitant
rates while her victims go uncompensated? Is it any wonder that our
profession is reviled? I hope someone from the California State Bar
reads The Times.</LD>

<HD>The Catholic Hierarchy Just Doesn't Understand</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The gist of Douglas Kmiec's Dec. 8 commentary, "It's a 'Get the
Bishops' Law," is that the Catholic Church has now, in one fell
swoop, become a victim. To the degree that the new law changes the
statute of limitations for tortious civil conduct, it will not be
held unconstitutional. As it relates to civil cases, the
constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws was designed to
prevent a new definition of an act being used as a method of
penalizing past behavior that was not otherwise tortious at the time.
A change of the statute of limitations does not create a new
definition of conduct; it merely goes back further in time.</LD>
<LD>   If the present crisis could simply be handled internally by the
Catholic Church, then of course this would be the best way to handle
it. But individual Catholics are not just members of a church; they
are citizens of a state and a country. These individuals need to be
protected from people in authority in a church that systematically
suppressed information about egregious conduct. If a matter is
suppressed for many years by bishops or others in authority, what
deterrent do these figures have to cause them not to suppress
information about such conduct?</LD>
<LD>   Changing the statute of limitations is one obvious answer. This is
not anti-Catholic; it is pro-justice.</LD>

<TE>   Kmiec makes some valid points about whether the suspension of the
statute of limitations to take effect Jan. 1 is good legislation, let
alone constitutional. However, his column and the California bishops'
letter read at every Mass on Sunday smacked of spin-doctoring.</TE>
<TE>   He writes that such laws put the good work the Catholic Church
does in jeopardy. I would assert that the good work that Catholics do
has already been put in jeopardy. In Los Angeles, dozens of
ministries were either cut altogether or hobbled. A church hierarchy
that would rather cut very important services, like gay and lesbian
outreach, campus ministry and others, deserves the kind of vitriol
this law represents.</TE>
<TE>   Kmiec and the bishops rightly insist that the assets of the church
belong to the people, but those people were never consulted or
considered in Los Angeles. The financial board told Cardinal Roger
Mahony to cover a $4-million shortfall, and he and his minions set
about firing people and closing ministries. The one thing I have
heard from my fellow Catholics, over and over again, is a frustration
at not being given a chance to raise the necessary funds to save
those ministries. Recent revelations in Boston and elsewhere make it
clear that the hierarchy of the Catholic Church is in need of a
serious wake-up call.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Priests May Seek Law's Resignation," Dec. 7: Kudos to Father
Walter Cuenin and the other 35 priests for their courage in defying
Cardinal Bernard Law's ban on archdiocesan gatherings at Cuenin's
parish. Perhaps this is the small beginning of the Catholic clergy
finally showing some initiative and reclaiming its self-respect from
an arrogant and out-of-touch hierarchy.</TE>
<TE>   The more haunting question remains unanswered: Did Law lie about
these latest revelations when he met with Pope John Paul II last
summer or did he simply omit them? It seems inconceivable that the
pope would not have demanded Law's resignation himself had he known
the full extent of the scandal.</TE>

<LD>On the facts, your Dec. 7 editorial, "Lump of Coal for the Jobless,"
turned out to be, well, lumpy. I did not "spearhead the charge
against extending benefits," as you claim. I authored legislation the
House unanimously approved Nov. 14, extending benefits for the
long-term unemployed. This bill would have continued for five weeks
the temporary extended unemployment benefits provided since March
2002. Already this year more than 3 million unemployed workers have
qualified. The House bill would have helped 800,000 in every state,
not just in "only a few states with the highest unemployment," as you
suggested.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, the Democrat-led Senate refused to act on this
bill. For the record, the Senate proposed instead to provide up to 26
more weeks of extended benefits, not 13 weeks, as you described. When
the new Congress convenes in January, stimulating the economy and
helping businesses create new jobs will be the first order of
business. Congress acted appropriately in providing extended
unemployment benefits this year, but jobs are what unemployed workers
need most.</LD>

<HD>Lott's Thurmond Remark Betrays a Racist Heart</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Lott Tries to Quell Furor Over Remark," Dec. 10: By now Sen.
Trent Lott's (R-Miss.) remarks, captured by CSPAN, are part of the
public record: "I want to say this about my state: When Strom
Thurmond ran for president, we voted for him. We're proud of it. And
if the rest of the country had followed our lead, we wouldn't have
had all these problems over all these years, either."</LD>
<LD>   Anyone who knows the platform that Thurmond ran on in 1948 --
racial segregation at any cost -- knows what Lott meant by "these
problems."</LD>
<LD>   This is the same Trent Lott who saluted the former members of the
Council of Conservative Citizens for how they stood up for their
principles, i.e., white supremacy.</LD>
<TE>   This is the same Trent Lott who pushed so hard for the nomination
of a friend, Charles Pickering, who passed on undercover intelligence
reports he had received from the Mississippi Sovereignty Commission
to an employer that was having "union problems." This commission is
another relic from the days when Mississippi refused to recognize
those parts of the Constitution it didn't like and the rights of
African Americans.</TE>
<TE>   All the spinning in the world cannot change the fact that the
Republican Party now has a leader who is an unreconstructed white
supremacist and who promotes the cause whenever possible. That
Mississippi has sent him to the Senate is regrettable. That the rest
of his party has made him their leader in the Senate is inexcusable.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Willis</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a Republican who hates racism, the issue is no longer Lott's
statement or unbelievable "apology" about a "poor choice of words"
that could never have been made by anybody other than a man with
racism in his heart or no brain in his head.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is the reaction of the Republican leadership. Without a
swift, unambiguous statement by President Bush, all elected
Republicans and Republican officials that condemns Lott and urges his
resignation as Senate Republican leader, the Republican Party will
rightly be seen as endorsing either racism or complete stupidity.
Every hour that ticks by without such a statement decreases the
credibility of any such statement when, and if, it finally comes.</TE>
<TE>   Allan J. Favish</TE>
<TE>   Santa Clarita</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   We have reached a new low. The head of the party of Lincoln in the
Senate makes a racist remark and the head of the Senate Democrats,
Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), makes excuses for him. It is not hard to
understand the basis of Lott's remarks. Lott spoke from his heart,
and his heart is racist. Shame on both Lott and Daschle! They should
resign in favor of people who understand what it is to lead.</TE>

<HD>Terror Suspect Feared Reprisals</HD>
<DH>Man arrested after deadly Bali bombing believed 'timing was
wrong,' report says. Younger radicals apparently ignored him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard C. Paddock</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>Weeks before the Oct. 12 Bali bombing, suspected terrorist leader Abu
Bakar Bashir argued against carrying out attacks in Indonesia because
of fears of a police crackdown, according to a report released
Wednesday by the International Crisis Group.</LD>
<LD>   But his views were disregarded by younger, more radical members of
the terrorist group Jemaah Islamiah, causing a "deep rift" within the
organization, according to the study by the Brussels-based conflict
research organization.</LD>
<LD>   "It was not that Bashir disagreed with violence as a tactic," it
says. "He was concerned that the timing was wrong."</LD>
<TE>   A Web site cited by a confessed participant asserts that an
"International Death Battalion" carried out the Bali attack to kill
Americans and their allies and avenge Muslim deaths.</TE>
<TE>   The bombing of two nightclubs killed 191 people, about half of
them Australians. Seven Americans died.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear whether Bashir knew of the attack in advance, but
his prediction about a crackdown proved to be right. Police, who had
been slow to investigate earlier terrorist attacks, are aggressively
pursuing the Bali bombers and have arrested two key members of Jemaah
Islamiah, Ali Gufron, better known as Mukhlas, and Imam Samudra, and
more than a dozen other suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir was arrested after the attack and accused of heading Jemaah
Islamiah. Police are investigating whether he is linked to earlier
church bombings and a plot to assassinate President Megawati
Sukarnoputri.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir denies any involvement in terrorist activity and contends
that Jemaah Islamiah does not exist. But he says that church bombings
are justified in the struggle to protect Muslims, and he praises
Osama bin Laden as a true Islamic warrior.</TE>
<TE>   Police are looking into Bashir's possible link to the Bali blasts,
although the crisis group concludes that the radical 64-year-old
cleric was probably not behind the attack.</TE>
<TE>   "He almost certainly has deep knowledge of the JI network and how
it operates, and he almost certainly had prior knowledge of some of
the bombings that have taken place in Indonesia," the report said.
"He is unlikely, however, to have been the mastermind."</TE>
<TE>   The inflammatory Web site, www.istimata.com, was pointed out by
Samudra after his arrest. It is unclear who wrote the material on the
site, but it appears to take credit for the Bali attack.</TE>
<TE>   The International Death Battalion's mission, it says, was "to
kill, fight and destroy America and its citizens along with other
citizens from other countries who joined the infidel crusade" in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Bali was selected as the target, the Web site says, because it is
a center for drugs, prostitution and Jewish intelligence operatives.
It is "the place where all the colonialists, terrorists, oppressors
and destroyers of the respect for Indonesian Muslim women gather,"
the site says.</TE>
<TE>   The authors of the Web site blame the United States and its allies
for the killing of Muslims in Afghanistan, the Middle East and other
parts of the world.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush "himself acknowledged that the so-called war of
'Undefinite Justice' is really a Crusade," the site says. "Every blow
will be repaid. Blood will be redeemed by blood. A life for a life."</TE>
<TE>   The Web site warns that more Westerners will be killed as long as
American forces remain in Afghanistan and terrorist suspects are
imprisoned at a U.S. base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Muslims who
cooperate with the U.S. also will be killed, the site says.</TE>
<TE>   "The attack on the Islamic State of Afghanistan by the
international Christian community and its allies (Allied Force),
under the Bush (may the Curse of Allah be upon him) leadership, will
not be forgotten," the site says.</TE>

<HD>U.S., Qatar Sign Air Base Accord</HD>
<DH>The deal gives American forces greater access to a facility
700 miles from the Iraqi capital.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Fineman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DOHA, Qatar</DL>
<LD>U.S. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and Qatar's foreign
minister signed an agreement Wednesday giving American armed forces
broader and more permanent access to a new $1-billion air base just
700 miles from Baghdad.</LD>
<LD>   Beneath crystal chandeliers in a palace of Florentine marble and
porcelain, Rumsfeld and Sheik Hamad Jassim ibn Jaber al Thani
announced a pact that deepens America's military alliance with this
strategic, energy-rich Persian Gulf state. They also sought to
distance the agreement from America's mounting war exercises in the
region and tough rhetoric aimed at Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   "The agreement we have signed today is not connected to Iraq. It
is an agreement that has been under discussion for many, many weeks
and months," Rumsfeld said. "It is simply the latest element in a
defense cooperation between our two countries, and it is a good one
and one that we are very pleased with, but I think it would be a
mistake to connect it to Iraq."</LD>
<TE>   American forces have been using Al Udeid Air Base, which is likely
to play a key role in any U.S. attack on Iraq, for months under a
decade-old defense agreement. That pact was updated two years ago to
include the new base.</TE>
<TE>   The Qatar Emiri Air Force owns and operates the base. The Qatari
government spent hundreds of millions of dollars to upgrade the
facility mainly to accommodate an expanded U.S. military presence.
More than 5,000 U.S. personnel are stationed at Al Udeid and at least
three other military bases in Qatar, including Camp As Sayliyah.</TE>
<TE>   In detailing the classified agreement, Rumsfeld said only that it
further expands "quality of life" and technology at U.S.
installations -- buzzwords, analysts said, for a more permanent
high-tech military presence 20 miles southwest of Doha, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   The timing of the signing ceremony dovetailed with war games that
Army Gen. Tommy Franks, commander of U.S. forces in the region, is
running from a new mobile forward headquarters at Camp As Sayliyah.
Franks attended the ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   It also coincides with U.S. Army live-fire exercises near the
Iraqi border in northern Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   Most Arab analysts here said the new pact was bound to send
another strong signal to Baghdad, which traditionally has maintained
close personal and diplomatic ties to Qatar and members of its ruling
family.</TE>
<TE>   The growing U.S. military relationship with this nation of
800,000, where U.S. energy firms have invested about $30 billion to
exploit the world's third-largest natural gas reserves, has provoked
soul-searching among Qataris. Officially, Qatar says it needs the
American forces here to safeguard its people, resources and
investments in an unstable region.</TE>
<TE>   But most Qataris oppose the U.S. using their country as a base for
any military operations against Iraq, according to political analysts
and ordinary Qataris. Many are further angered by President Bush's
unflagging support for Israel and the American backlash against Arabs
after the Sept. 11 terror attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The growing U.S.-Qatari military ties also feed into the country's
complex relationship with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   A Qatari military regiment fought alongside U.S.-led coalition
forces who drove Iraq from Kuwait in 1991; it was the first to plant
its flag on liberated Kuwaiti sand.</TE>
<TE>   But Qatar also was among the nations that maintained diplomatic
relations with Baghdad after Iraq invaded its southern neighbor. And
Iraq has allowed members of Qatar's royal family to continue their
Bedouin tradition of annual trips with hunting falcons to the Iraqi
desert.</TE>
<TE>   Qatar's foreign minister stressed Wednesday that Doha has no
intention of interfering in Iraq's internal affairs, flatly rejecting
rumors that it planned to play host to members of Iraq's exiled
political opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Hamad Jassim also sought to downplay the significance of the new
base agreement. He called Rumsfeld's trip here "a normal visit
between friends," although he acknowledged that "the relationship
between both countries has been growing."</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld spun the visit into the overarching theme of his trip,
which also included visits to Eritrea, Ethiopia and the tiny East
African state of Djibouti. The tour, he said, was meant to applaud
countries in the region for fighting terror.</TE>
<TE>   "I thanked the minister for the wonderful cooperation ... in our
global war on terror," Rumsfeld said in relating his closed-door
session with the sheik.</TE>

<LD>   The cars were each packed with at least 550 pounds of explosives
and rigged with remote controls that allowed the bombers to guide the
vehicles to their designated targets, including a police barracks and
a bus station. Police arrested six suspects.</LD>

<LD>South Korea's Supreme Court convicted a U.S. soldier charged with
hitting a Korean pedestrian in a car accident and sentenced him to
eight months in prison. The ruling required the U.S. military to hand
Ronnie D. Kirby, 27, over to South Korean authorities to have him
serve the term in a Korean prison.</LD>
<LD>   "Since the accident occurred not while on official duty, South
Korea has jurisdiction on the case," said Lee Ferguson, a U.S.

<HD>Chechen Envoy Is Still Free as Moscow Seeks His Return</HD>
<DH>London court orders rebel to appear for extradition hearing
next month. He continues to deny the Kremlin's accusations against
him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Dixon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Russia on Wednesday pushed on with its struggle to extradite a
Chechen rebel envoy to face terrorist charges in Moscow, even as a
London court ruled that he could remain free on bail, paid by
activist actress Vanessa Redgrave.</LD>
<LD>   Denmark had rebuffed an extradition bid last month, claiming that
Russian authorities had failed to provide sufficient evidence against
Ahmed Zakayev, the representative of Chechen separatist leader Aslan
Maskhadov.</LD>
<LD>   Zakayev, 43, was arrested last week when entering Britain with
Redgrave, a supporter of the Chechen cause who asserts that Zakayev
will be killed if he returns to Moscow.</LD>
<TE>   The extradition bid has become a key part of Moscow's effort to
deflect Western criticism of its action in Chechnya by depicting the
fighters in the separatist Russian republic as international
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   A British court Wednesday ordered Zakayev, who was freed on
$78,000 bail Friday, to appear at an extradition hearing next month.
The judge in the case ordered that details of Zakayev's address be
suppressed.</TE>
<TE>   After the hearing, Zakayev denied Russia's accusation that he had
committed terrorists acts between 1995 and 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "I can submit to a lie detector test or swear on the Koran. Not
one of these crimes has any basis," he said. "It is not a coincidence
that I chose to come to Britain. Unless there is a political
decision, there can be no discussion of my being turned over."</TE>
<TE>   Russian Prosecutor General Vladimir Ustinov said Zakayev had
committed serious crimes. He claimed that Zakayev fired a pistol at
the hand of a man who refused to cooperate with the rebels, shooting
off three fingers.</TE>
<TE>   "And all this has been proven by medical documents. It is in the
forensic report," Ustinov said on Russian television.</TE>
<TE>   "Make no mistake about it: Hundreds and thousands of people were
wounded and killed as a result of the crimes committed by Zakayev,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Zakayev and Maskhadov are seen as relatively moderate Chechen
separatists; however, a U.S. official in Moscow recently backed
Russia's view that Maskhadov should be excluded from any peace talks,
describing him as "damaged goods."</TE>
<TE>   In comments to journalists Tuesday, Zakayev argued that the only
path to peace was for Europe to pressure Russia to agree to talks
with the separatists and later to send in peacekeeping forces.</TE>
<TE>   Until Sept. 11, Russia had limited success in depicting Chechen
rebels as international terrorists. But since then, Western countries
have become concerned about links between militant groups such as Al
Qaeda and some Chechen rebel commanders, notably the militant
Khattab, formerly the main funnel for funds flowing to the
separatists. Russian authorities claimed responsibility for his fatal
poisoning in March.</TE>
<TE>   Since Chechen rebels took hundreds of people hostage in a Moscow
theater in October, the Kremlin has sought to portray life in
Chechnya as returning to normal. The hostage-taking left 129 captives
dead, all but two from the gas used by Moscow before troops stormed
the theater.</TE>
<TE>   In Chechnya on Wednesday, nearly 400 pro-Moscow Chechens supported
Kremlin plans for a new constitution and presidential elections in
the republic. Speaking on Echo of Moscow radio, Zakayev said the
congress was political in nature and would change nothing.</TE>
<TE>   A prominent liberal politician in Moscow, Boris Y. Nemtsov, called
for peace talks with rebel figures who had no blood on their hands.
He warned that if Russian troops still occupied the republic,
Chechens wouldn't support a new constitution.</TE>

<DL>COLISEO, Cuba</DL>
<LD>A crowded passenger train derailed and overturned in central Cuba,
killing 14 people and injuring 74 others and closing the country's
main railway line, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The engine of train No. 11, which was heading from Havana to
eastern Cuba, jumped the rails and crashed Tuesday night, pulling
five passenger cars and a freight wagon onto their sides, witnesses
said.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the dead were traveling in the first passenger coach,
which hit a concrete structure that sliced through the length of the
car.</LD>
<TE>   "It was terrible. We heard a noise. Then we crashed, and
everything was dark," the train's mechanic, Orlando Olivera, said.</TE>
<TE>   The engine driver was killed in the accident, Olivera said. The
mechanic said it was the seventh accident he had been in and he was
quitting his job because Cuba's old railway tracks had become too
risky.</TE>
<TE>   The train was traveling to the eastern city of Santiago when the
accident occurred outside Coliseo, about 30 miles east of the port
city of Matanzas.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said they had not determined the cause.</TE>

<HD>CIA Sees Nothing New in Iraq's Arms Disclosure</HD>
<DH>Concerns are growing that the dossier consists mostly of
previously discredited reports.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Drogin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The CIA delivered an initial assessment of Iraq's declaration of
banned weapons programs to the White House on Wednesday amid growing
concerns that the bulk of the 12,000-page dossier consists of
previously discredited Iraqi reports.</LD>
<LD>   In particular, officials said, Iraq's account of its nuclear
weapons program -- totaling 2,081 pages, including a 113-page
executive summary -- appears to be largely a duplicate of Iraqi
declarations delivered to U.N. inspectors in 1996 and 1997.</LD>
<LD>   Thousands more pages that Iraq submitted over the weekend on its
biological and chemical weapons programs also appear to be copies of
reports that U.N. weapons inspectors repeatedly rejected as
inadequate and incomplete between 1995 and 1998, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   "The initial conclusion is there's nothing really new," said one
official who is assisting in the review. "What I'm hearing is it's
all recycled and [Iraqi claims that] it didn't do anything wrong."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. analysts are especially looking to see whether Iraq has
adequately answered scores of questions left unresolved during the
U.N. inspections that ended in 1998, and whether it can explain a
body of intelligence since 1998 suggesting that Baghdad has rebuilt
at least some of its proscribed weapons programs.</TE>
<TE>   Several Arabic-language portions of the report, including a
300-page section that details Iraqi industrial and other facilities
involved in nuclear research or development, have now been translated
and are undergoing what the official called a "line-by-line review to
see if [Iraq] inserted something that wasn't in previous reports....
Nothing has emerged yet."</TE>
<TE>   The White House softened its rhetoric on Iraq this week as the
review got underway. But a determination that President Saddam
Hussein's regime failed to provide an accurate and complete account
of its proscribed weapons programs, as mandated by a Nov. 8
resolution by the U.N. Security Council, almost certainly would
rekindle Bush administration efforts to disarm Baghdad by force.</TE>
<TE>   "All the indications are so far that Iraq has taken a hard line,"
said David Albright, a former nuclear weapons inspector in Iraq and
president of the Institute for Science and International Security, a
Washington think tank. "Perhaps Saddam has decided war is inevitable,
so why give up anything? Either that, or they want to give things up
gradually and see what happens."</TE>
<TE>   Pressure is growing on the CIA to complete its assessment. Hans
Blix, the chief United Nations weapons inspector, said Tuesday that
he planned to complete his analysis by Friday and give a censored
version of the raw document to the full Security Council as early as
Monday. Details are expected to quickly leak at that point.</TE>
<TE>   The council's five permanent members -- the United States,
Britain, Russia, China and France, all of which already have nuclear
weapons -- are receiving unedited copies of the report.</TE>
<TE>   Blix said he would delete especially sensitive material --
including any blueprints or other designs for nuclear weapons, as
well as plans for converting short-range missiles to long-range
rockets -- before handing over the document. He said he is focusing
on a 3,000-page section that includes fresh details about Iraq's
activities since U.N. inspectors withdrew four years ago. The CIA is
still studying the trove of documents and CD-ROMs with teams of
weapons specialists and other experts from the Pentagon's Defense
Intelligence Agency, the State Department's Intelligence and Research
division, the Energy Department's Office of Intelligence, and a group
of nuclear scientists and technicians from the Los Alamos National
Laboratory in New Mexico, among others.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an ongoing process," an intelligence official said of the
CIA-led review. He said the agency is providing regular updates to
the White House "as our work proceeds."</TE>
<TE>   Gaps in Iraq's previous declarations of its biological and
chemical weapons program are of special concern, officials said. And
Iraq has a history of using fresh packaging for old reports.</TE>
<TE>   A summary of the previous U.N. inspection effort in Iraq, issued
in January 1999, notes that Baghdad denied even having a biological
weapons program until 1995, for example, and that it used "fraudulent
statements, forged documents, misrepresentation of the roles of
people and facilities and other specific acts" to perpetuate the
deception.</TE>
<TE>   After a senior Iraqi defector first revealed the clandestine
effort in July 1995, Baghdad issued three "full, final and complete"
declarations of its germ warfare research and production efforts.</TE>
<TE>   The first was declared null and void by Iraq. The second, in June
1996, was rejected by U.N. inspectors as incomplete. The third,
issued in September 1997, "contained no new significant information
from the previous one" and was "deficient in all areas," according to
the U.N. report.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq then appealed for a review and met a team of U.N. experts in
Vienna in March 1998. "Iraq did not present any new information at
that meeting and the experts therefore reviewed the same material for
the third time," the report notes.</TE>
<TE>   The inspectors particularly cited conflicting or insufficient
credible details on the production and location not only of such bulk
biological warfare agents as anthrax, botulinum toxin, aflatoxin and
wheat smut, but also of warheads designed to deliver them. In many
cases, Iraq claimed that it had destroyed the weapons but could
produce no proof that it had done so.</TE>
<TE>   "They basically gave 'the dog ate my homework' excuse -- that when
they destroyed their biological and chemical weapons, they destroyed
their documents as well," said Jonathan Tucker, another former U.N.
inspector. "We know that's false."</TE>
<TE>   Officials are also looking to see whether Iraq can explain its
apparent attempts to procure and import uranium and specialized parts
for nuclear weapons development since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   One official said Iraqi officials have privately acknowledged
making five covert attempts since 1998 to obtain highly specialized
aluminum tubes from overseas sources. The Iraqis said the tubes were
intended for conventional artillery rockets.</TE>
<TE>   White House officials this fall accused Iraq of trying to import
the tubes to build a gas centrifuge to enrich uranium for nuclear
bombs. Several U.S. scientists questioned the claim, however,
asserting that the tubes were the wrong dimensions for centrifuges.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's nuclear weapons program was essentially destroyed or
dismantled by the time weapons inspectors left in 1998, according to
the International Atomic Energy Agency. But U.S. and British
intelligence reported in October that Hussein's regime had secretly
continued and even accelerated its effort to build a nuclear bomb
since then.</TE>
<TE>   A senior Iraqi official in Baghdad last weekend admitted for the
first time what U.S. and U.N. officials concluded years ago: that
Iraq was only six months or so from assembling a workable nuclear
device when Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990. The attack led to the
Persian Gulf War in 1991 and the subsequent U.N. effort to disarm
Iraq of any weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   The listings of production and other weapons sites in the Iraqi
dossier are proving useful to U.N. inspectors. Newly reinforced teams
of inspectors visited six suspect sites Wednesday, the most in a day
since inspections began two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   One group visited the Karama factory in Baghdad for missile and
tank parts. The factory was built in 1999 and is part of Iraq's
Military Industrialization Commission, but Iraqi officials insisted
that nothing illegal was being done there.</TE>
<TE>   "We make precision parts for Al-Samoud missiles," Brig. Kamel
Saeed, the director, told reporters who toured the site after the
U.N. team left. The 60-foot rocket has a maximum range of 95 miles,
which is permitted under the Gulf War cease-fire terms.</TE>
<TE>   Hiro Ueki, a spokesman for the inspectors, said in a statement
that Iraq had included the site in a declaration it submitted Oct. 1
in Vienna. That declaration focused on factories and facilities that
used so-called dual-use materials or parts that might have military
applications.</TE>
<TE>   Another weapons facility at the site was bombed by U.S. warplanes
in late 1998, Saeed said. The U.N. experts checked machines
previously tagged by arms teams at the destroyed facility.</TE>
<TE>   "They checked and found everything is OK. There were no
provocations but questions, and we answered them," Saeed added. U.N.
officials declined to characterize the visit.</TE>

<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Two peace activists abandoned Israel's Labor Party for a new alliance
Wednesday, sharpening the debate over how to make peace with
Palestinians.</LD>
<LD>   Yossi Beilin, an architect of the Oslo peace accords, and Yael
Dayan, daughter of war hero and former Defense Minister Moshe Dayan,
joined Meretz, a smaller, more dovish bloc with a liberal social
platform.</LD>
<LD>   The two were angered that they were not chosen in a primary to be
among Labor's top candidates for parliament.</LD>
<TE>   Both Israelis and Palestinians are planning elections in January,
but Palestinians said theirs will probably have to be postponed
because Israeli military operations make it nearly impossible to
organize them.</TE>
<TE>   Ali Jarbawi, head of the Palestinian election committee, said the
panel would meet next week to recommend that the Jan. 20 vote be
delayed.</TE>

<HD>Israel Bans Movie on West Bank Offensive</HD>
<DH>Ratings board says 'Jenin, Jenin' documentary is distorted.
Arab director says he will appeal the decision.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israel's Film Ratings Board was barraged with criticism Wednesday
after it banned a documentary on an Israeli offensive in the West
Bank refugee camp of Jenin for portraying its soldiers as war
criminals.</LD>
<LD>   The board said it decided to ban "Jenin, Jenin," by Israeli Arab
actor and director Mohammed Bakri, for a "distorted presentation of
events in the guise of democratic truth which could mislead the
public."</LD>
<LD>   "The public ... could mistakenly think that Israeli soldiers are
perpetrating war crimes systematically and intentionally," the board
said, calling the work a "one-sided propaganda film."</LD>
<TE>   It was the first time in 15 years that the ratings board had
censored a movie.</TE>
<TE>   Bakri's film describes an Israeli offensive in the camp in April
through the eyes of its residents. More than 50 Palestinians,
including civilians and combatants, and 23 Israeli soldiers were
killed during the raid, launched after a series of suicide bombings
in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a real shame for me because it shows that democracy in
Israel is not reserved for all of its citizens," Bakri said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that he would appeal to the Israeli Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli media commentators decried the censorship.</TE>
<TE>   "The ratings board -- and the cable companies which also decided
to pull the plug on the film -- consider the Israeli public ... to be
complete idiots incapable of judging a cinematic work for
themselves," media commentator Raanan Shaked wrote in the Yediot
Aharonot daily.</TE>
<TE>   "Jenin, Jenin," filmed several weeks after the raid, shows the
destruction of a large swath of the camp by Israeli bulldozers. It
quotes residents saying that soldiers had committed war crimes,
including shooting at an elderly man and burying people alive as
their homes were demolished.</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers who served in the campaign accused some of the residents
interviewed of fabricating events.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights groups such as Amnesty International have said
Israeli soldiers committed war crimes during the operation but
rejected Palestinian claims that a massacre took place. Israeli
officials refused to cooperate with a planned U.N. inquiry into the
operation, and it was dropped.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>PHNOM PENH, Cambodia</DL>
<LD>Nuon Chea, one of the Khmer Rouge's top surviving leaders, made a
surprise appearance in a Cambodian court today in support of a former
colleague accused of murdering three Western backpackers.</LD>
<LD>   Sam Bith, 70, an ex-general with the Khmer Rouge, the Marxist
rebels responsible for the genocide of the killing fields, is charged
with the 1994 kidnapping and execution of three backpackers from
Australia, Britain and France. Sam Bith is the most senior of three
commanders charged in the case.</LD>
<LD>   Few expected that the ailing Nuon Chea -- sporting a pair of natty
1960s-style sunglasses -- would turn up from the old Khmer Rouge
stronghold of Pailin, about 180 miles northwest of Phnom Penh, the
capital, to protest Sam Bith's innocence.</LD>
<TE>   Appearing as a witness, however, the 77-year-old's only words were
to confirm his name and age. Soon after his taking the stand, the
hearing was adjourned until Friday because of the ill health of the
defendant, the judge said.</TE>
<TE>   After Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot's death in 1998, Nuon Chea became
a prime target for those pressing for an international tribunal for
Cambodia's 1975-79 genocide, in which more than a million people
died.</TE>

<HD>The Fatal Flaw of Arrogance</HD>
<DH>What the doctor says goes in Japan. That attitude, combined
with a lack of clinical training and limited patients' rights, can
spell disaster.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Magnier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TAKASAKI, Japan</DL>
<LD>As they replay the painful end of their daughter's life, Toshiaki and
Mutsumi Hirayanagi remember the conversation they had hours before
Akika was admitted to Tokyo Women's Medical University Hospital for
routine heart surgery.</LD>
<LD>   "What's death like?" the 12-year-old had asked.</LD>
<LD>   A bit shocked, Mutsumi told her that death meant you faded away.
Toshiaki interrupted: "It's nothing to worry about. Hospital
techniques are very advanced these days, and there's little chance of
dying during an operation."</LD>
<TE>   Today, the Hirayanagis blame the surgeons, the hospital, the
Health Ministry and the system. Most of all, they blame themselves,
as they second-guess their every decision.</TE>
<TE>   They've endured the unspeakable pain of losing a child, the added
injury of an alleged hospital cover-up and the loss of privacy that
has followed their high-profile battle against Japan's entrenched
medical establishment.</TE>
<TE>   All their pent-up guilt, anger and frustration can't change one
fact, however: Their daughter entered Japan's foremost cardiac
hospital vibrant and very much alive and was dead a few days later.</TE>
<TE>   Akika's life went largely unnoticed by most Japanese. But her
death 21 months ago has had a huge impact on the medical care debate.
Her name has become a rallying cry for critics troubled by what they
see as deeply rooted tolerance of medical malpractice here. Among the
reasons they cite are Japan's nonconfrontational culture, weak
consumer movement and lack of checks and balances.</TE>
<TE>   The case has hit a nerve with the Japanese public in part because
it involved a young, innocent victim and because the alleged cover-up
seemed so blatant.</TE>
<TE>   Two of Akika's attending physicians were arrested and jailed for
malpractice, an extreme rarity in Japan. The government has promised
reforms. And Tokyo Women's has had its funding cut.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, the vast majority of doctors in Japan are
conscientious and hard-working, and many aspects of Japan's health
system put the U.S. and other Western countries to shame. Japan, with
its near-universal insurance coverage, generally healthy diet and
broad-based middle class, enjoys low infant mortality rates, high
life expectancy and good quality of life.</TE>
<TE>   But too often, health care is organized for the convenience of
doctors rather than the safety of patients, critics say. Japanese
doctors receive no mandatory hands-on training, go from books to
treating patients overnight and are rarely questioned.</TE>
<TE>   American physicians, in comparison, have become increasingly open
about treatment options in recent years, as patients eagerly seek
second opinions. Patients have ready access to courts and local
regulators when problems arise. And with rare exception, U.S. doctors
immune from criticism have gone the way of the house call.</TE>
<TE>   Here in recent years, a spate of alleged malpractice cases that
reads like a horror show have made headlines.</TE>
<TE>   Lung and heart patients mixed up at Yokohama City University
Hospital have the wrong organs removed. A rheumatism patient at Hiroo
General Hospital dies after being injected with disinfectant. A
plastic surgeon leaves part of a surgical saw in a patient's nose,
then tells her it's meant to improve stability. And 10,000 patients
receive inaccurate blood diagnostic work at Tokyo Rinkai Hospital
after machines are incorrectly set over a six-month period.</TE>
<TE>   Other cases involve apparent euthanasia done without the family's
consent. There are reports of hospitals performing experimental
operations on terminal patients -- again without the family's
permission -- for practice. At least 43 hospitals admit allowing
dentists to do doctors' work, including 25 that let them operate.</TE>
<TE>   No comprehensive malpractice figures are available. But in the
first official malpractice survey, the Health, Labor and Welfare
Ministry revealed in April that 15,000 medical errors occurred in
Japan's top 82 hospitals over a two-year period. Many believe that
the numbers are much higher.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese doctors go directly from high school into a six-year
medical program built around rote memorization, which is a big part
of the problem, critics say. Most professors view teaching as a
distraction because promotions are tied to research. Clinical
training is not part of the curriculum, and there are no mandatory
internship or residency programs. In fact, it's illegal to be
involved in patient care before you're licensed.</TE>
<TE>   After taking the exam, however, the magnets flip. Newly minted
doctors are fully qualified to practice medicine, even, in theory, to
perform brain surgery after doing little more than reading about it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like racing a Formula One car as soon as you get your
driver's license," said Tsutomu Wada, author of a book on medical
malpractice. "From the patient's perspective, it's a disaster."</TE>
<TE>   Young doctors coming to Osaka's Yao General Hospital are surprised
to hear sounds when they first put a stethoscope to the patient's
chest, says Dr. Isao Mori, the institution's director and head of a
group working to raise malpractice awareness. Asked whether they hear
a heart murmur, some respond: "What's a murmur?"</TE>
<TE>   There's little emphasis on diagnostic skills because doctors see
up to 100 patients a day. The "three-hour wait and three-minute
visit" patient system is driven by an insurance system that
compensates doctors little for visits and lots for prescribing drugs.
And there's enormous sectionalism, with hospitals and even
departments loath to share information.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tribal," says Dr. Jiro Nakano, an advisor to Osaka's
Hokuetsu General Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   American doctors must take courses before getting their license
renewed, which generally occurs every three years depending on the
state. Japanese, once licensed, are never required to brush up on
skills or renew their qualifications. As Japan's population ages
rapidly, it's not unusual to find 80-year-old doctors, their hands
shaking and nearly blind, still hard at work.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most dangerous, and most difficult to quantify, is
arrogance. The words of Japanese doctors tend to be sacred and immune
from review by nurses, fellow doctors or administrators. Many view a
patient's questions as an affront.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's legal system has no discovery process, making it difficult
for ordinary citizens to pry information out of a medical system that
isn't eager to reveal its bloody linens.</TE>
<TE>   The nation has few lawyers and even fewer devoted to malpractice.
Doctors rarely testify and justice is often slow, forcing most
malpractice victims to give up or settle. Although the number of
malpractice cases is rising sharply -- Tokyo and Osaka recently
started special court sections to handle the overload -- only 805
were filed last year, far fewer than in many U.S. states. California,
for instance, had at least 1,215 malpractice complaints settled in
the fiscal year ending July 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Add a level of professional courtesy between doctors and judges,
critics say, and you see why malpractice suits against doctors take
four times longer to conclude and are won only 40% of the time, half
as often as other types of cases.</TE>
<TE>   Although charts are legal documents in the U.S., they're
considered a doctor's private notes in Japan, with no penalties for
altering records after something goes wrong and no patient access
without the doctor's approval.</TE>
<TE>   "Altering records happens every day in Japan," said Shunsuke
Furuse, a malpractice attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Hokuto Hoshi, executive board member with the Japan Medical Assn.,
admits that arrogance, insularity, lax standards and excess
memorization are problems, but he says that a new medical internship
program after 2004 should help.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not trying to protect bad hospitals, but outsiders can't
accurately judge things like death rates," he said, adding that
patients need to trust their doctors more. "We support voluntary
efforts, not those imposed from outside."</TE>
<TE>   For Akika's family, the truth might have remained hidden if
Toshiaki hadn't been a dentist with training in anesthesia. Their
second daughter was born with a hole between her heart's two
chambers. When she was 2, doctors told the family that her condition
wasn't life-threatening but recommended that she eventually have an
operation.</TE>
<TE>   Akika was small, but her parents worked hard to treat her just
like her two sisters. Cautious teachers wouldn't allow her to swim or
exercise, but the Hirayanagis enrolled her in a swimming class after
school. She enjoyed reading and developed a strong interest in the
natural sciences, stargazing and collecting shells.</TE>
<TE>   By sixth grade, the growing height and weight gap between Akika
and her classmates was affecting her self-esteem. So in December
2000, her parents approached Tokyo Women's, hoping a heart operation
might prompt a growth spurt. The Hirayanagis also approached a
competing hospital but were told that the procedure was routine,
Tokyo Women's was highly qualified and a second opinion wasn't
necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Two days before the March 2 operation, Tokyo Women's told them
that a spot had suddenly opened up and advised them to take it.
Concerned by the assembly-line atmosphere, they nevertheless pulled
together a few things for Akika -- some comic books and audiotapes --
and asked to meet the doctor.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital grudgingly agreed, and Toshiaki and Mutsumi were told
to come at 9 a.m. to meet the lead surgeon, Kazuhiro Seo. They waited
all day before finally seeing him that evening. "It was like we were
waiting for the high and mighty doctor to grant us an audience,"
Mutsumi said.</TE>
<TE>   Accusatory Tone</TE>
<TE>   As soon as Seo walked in, he fired a question at them in an
accusatory tone, throwing a pen onto the table for emphasis: "Do you
know the structure of the heart?"</TE>
<TE>   Toshiaki sputtered something about blood, but says Seo's
underlying message was clear: Don't bother me unless you want to do
the operation yourself. "There was such arrogance," Toshiaki said.</TE>
<TE>   The jarring incident made the Hirayanagis so uncomfortable that
they considered calling off the operation. But they knew that they
would be branded troublemakers at hospitals all over the country.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd be notorious," Toshiaki said. "We'd be on a black list."</TE>
<TE>   They worried about getting Seo even more upset, damaging his
career. They worried about what Akika's grandparents would think.
With just 15 minutes to decide, they signed the consent form. "It's a
decision I'll never forgive myself for," Toshiaki said.</TE>
<TE>   Now after 8 p.m., they raced upstairs, but Akika was heavily
sedated. They never got the chance to say goodbye.</TE>
<TE>   The operation early the following morning was supposed to last
until 2 p.m. But it was after 5:30 before Akika was wheeled out. Her
face was heavily swollen, her skin gray.</TE>
<TE>   There was something else: Seo's attitude. He was talking a lot.
"When you're trying to hide something, you tend to speak too much,"
Toshiaki said. "And the other doctors looked grave."</TE>
<TE>   The hospital limited their visits to 20 minutes a day, but it was
obvious that Akika was deteriorating rapidly. Three days after the
surgery, Tokyo Women's notified her parents that Akika was dead and
said the cause was "heart failure."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the funeral, an anonymous letter in a hospital
envelope suggested that the operation had been anything but routine.
It spoke of problems with the heart-lung machine and claimed that Seo
had tried to cover them up.</TE>
<TE>   For the next two months, the couple petitioned the hospital for
answers only to be met with silence or excuses. Finally, the family
sought a court order for the medical records, and in May, formally
requested a hospital investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Seo and two senior hospital administrators met them in October at
a hotel near their Takasaki house. Akika hadn't died of heart failure
and they had altered the records, they admitted. The blood
circulation machine had malfunctioned for 20 to 40 minutes, resulting
in massive brain damage.</TE>
<TE>   Gradually over the next several months, more details leaked out.
Two hospital departments had been in a turf battle -- the children's
and adult coronary departments -- and sought to control the case. By
some accounts, Kazuki Sato, the doctor overseeing the heart-lung
machine, set the machine at twice its recommended level, which
blocked circulation and caused blood to seep from Akika's nose,
leading to panic once the problem was discovered.</TE>
<TE>   After the operation, lead surgeon Seo allegedly ordered hospital
staff, including the head nurse and a technician, to alter the
records. The 6- to 7-millimeter dilation of Akika's pupils was
changed to a 4 to mask her brain damage.</TE>
<TE>   Cover-Up Reported</TE>
<TE>   According to a report issued a few months ago by an independent
investigative committee appointed by the hospital, the head nurse
notified surgery supervisor Yasuharu Imai of the tampered chart, but
Imai subsequently told the hospital director that nothing had been
altered. "The nature of the entire hospital is to cover up scandals,"
the report said, even as the document itself avoided naming many of
those involved.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to reach Seo and his subordinate Sato in jail were
unsuccessful. Seo's lawyer declined to comment; Sato's could not be
reached.</TE>
<TE>   Toshiaki says he has visited Seo in jail and thinks that the two
doctors are scapegoats for the hospital and the broader system. He
was willing, he says, to accept an apology, an out-of-court financial
settlement and some evidence that the doctors and hospital have taken
the issue to heart. But the police are prosecuting Sato on charges of
professional negligence leading to death and Seo on destruction of
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   The Hirayanagis say they believe that the police department's zeal
is driven by a need to look effective in the face of so much media
attention. It will probably be several years before the criminal case
is concluded.</TE>
<TE>   "We still feel like Akika's alive. It all happened so quickly, and
we're still having trouble believing it," Toshiaki said. "I truly
hope this whole thing will do something to change the system."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Releases Ship With Scuds</HD>
<DH>The vessel is freed after Yemen promises it won't buy any
more missiles from North Korea. The incident exposes a hole in an
arms treaty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Hendren and Sonni Efron</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A chagrined Bush administration Wednesday released a vessel carrying
Scud missiles from North Korea to Yemen, after securing a fresh
promise from the Yemeni government that it would stop buying such
weapons from the communist regime.</LD>
<LD>   Administration officials had trumpeted this week's seizure of the
vessel as a blow against arms dealing by cash-strapped North Korea,
singled out by the U.S. as a dangerous source of weapons
proliferation.</LD>
<LD>   But on Wednesday, after phone calls between the Yemeni government
and Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell, administration officials said they were forced to let the
missiles reach their destination because no international law
permitted Washington to block the delivery. U.S. intelligence agents
had tracked the ship from North Korea to the Arabian Sea since
mid-November, suspecting it was bound for Iraq, White House Press
Secretary Ari Fleischer said.</LD>
<TE>   "We have no choice but to obey international law," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   About 600 miles off the Yemeni coast, officials from a Spanish
ship that had been patrolling the area as part of an international
effort to enforce a trade embargo against Iraq boarded the vessel,
the So-San, whose name and identifying numbers had been painted over.
They found 15 Scud missiles hidden under bags of cement.</TE>
<TE>   The incident highlights a loophole in the international treaty
designed to prevent the spread of missile technology. The Missile
Technology Control Regime bans the export of missiles with a range of
more than 185 miles, including some of the easily hidden, widely
manufactured but notoriously inaccurate Scuds. Neither North Korea
nor Yemen has signed the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The fracas also spotlights the difficulty in separating friend
from foe in the administration's war on terrorism. Yemen and
Pakistan, two key allies in the global campaign, are among the
biggest weapons customers of North Korea, a nation that President
Bush has named -- along with Iraq and Iran -- as part of an "axis of
evil."</TE>
<TE>   "Today's action has been a real blow to U.S. credibility and U.S.
nonproliferation policy," said Jon B. Wolfsthal, a nonproliferation
expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "How do you
say it's OK for Yemen but not for Iran?"</TE>
<TE>   Only Tuesday, the administration issued a national security
strategy document that says weapons of mass destruction in the
possession of hostile states and terrorists represent one of the
major challenges to U.S. security. The document states that
"effective interdiction is a critical part of the U.S. strategy to
combat weapons of mass destruction and their delivery means."</TE>
<TE>   The administration has objected to all or part of a number of
treaties, including the Antiballistic Missile Treaty and the Chemical
Weapons Convention, particularly when it sees such treaties as
unenforced or unenforceable.</TE>
<TE>   The president's spokesman said the inability of the United States
to block the Scud shipment revealed a need to strengthen
international laws on arms transfers.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing that this does underscore is the need to take a look
[at] -- and we will do so with friends and others around the world --
whether or not the international regimes that deal with missile
proliferation need a second look," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   On Capitol Hill, some lawmakers offered a harsher assessment.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no idea whether these missiles were really intended for
the Yemeni military or whether they would end up in the wrong hands,"
said Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.). "The Bush administration, in
its focus on disarming Iraq, appears to be ignoring other potential
threats to our security."</TE>
<TE>   The administration apparently was driven by a concern that the
weapons were headed for Iraq, analysts said. Intercepting a shipment
of Scuds from North Korea to Iraq could have bolstered the U.S.
position on Iraq. Fleischer said the White House "wanted to make
certain that the weapons did not end up in the hands of either
terrorists or terrorist nations."</TE>
<TE>   Upon learning that the Yemenis had ordered the missiles, some
experts said the administration made the only decision it could.</TE>
<TE>   The incident began when U.S. intelligence officials notified
Spanish authorities of a suspicious vessel near the Persian Gulf. The
United States began tracking the vessel after learning of its
contents in mid-November, Fleischer said. The U.S. asked Yemen about
the shipment at the time, but Yemen denied that it had purchased the
missiles, U.S. officials said on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The ship flew no flag, declined to identify itself and maneuvered
to evade its pursuer, even after the Spanish frigate fired three
warning shots over the So-San's bow, Spanish and U.S. authorities
said. Under maritime law, an unflagged vessel may be stopped and
searched.</TE>
<TE>   Spanish marine sharpshooters then fired at cables on the So-San to
clear the way for helicopter-borne commandos to descend by rope onto
the deck, Spanish officials said. No one was injured. After boarding
the ship, the commandos discovered the hidden weapons. The missiles
were not on the ship's cargo listing, officials said. Spain turned
over the intercepted vessel to the U.S. Navy.</TE>
<TE>   The United States released the ship after securing a promise from
Yemeni officials that they would not transfer the arms to another
country or to militant groups, U.S. officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The Yemenis, who said the contract to purchase the missiles was
made "long ago," promised to make no more purchases of missiles from
North Korea, although U.S. officials acknowledged that Yemeni
authorities had made the same promise before. Asked why the White
House would accept such a promise a second time, a senior Pentagon
official said, "We need them."</TE>
<TE>   Since the Sept. 11 attacks, Yemen has been an eager ally in the
war on terrorism. The Yemeni government cooperated with the CIA last
month in an attack by an unmanned aircraft that killed six suspected
Al Qaeda operatives.</TE>
<TE>   The fast-moving developments in the missile affair seemed to
whipsaw Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, who has been touring
the Horn of Africa and the Persian Gulf this week. Speaking to
reporters early Wednesday in the impoverished East African state of
Djibouti, across the Red Sea from Yemen, he vowed that the missiles
would never reach what he said then was an unknown destination.</TE>
<TE>   "There's clearly an interest in determining where they were
headed, but they're not going to get there," Rumsfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   Hours later, in the Persian Gulf state of Qatar, Rumsfeld's tone
was sharply altered. "I'll leave it to the folks in Washington," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The about-face by American leaders followed a flurry of diplomacy.
First, Yemen's foreign minister, Abubakr al Qerbi, delivered a letter
of protest over the seizure to the U.S. and Spanish embassies
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The cargo belongs to the Yemeni government and its armed forces
for defense purposes, and it will not reach a third party," Qerbi
wrote, according to Yemen's official Saba news agency.</TE>
<TE>   Powell later telephoned Qerbi, and Yemeni President Ali Abdullah
Saleh called Cheney late Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The interdiction became an embarrassment for the Bush
administration when Yemen belatedly claimed the shipment. For years,
Yemen has had a spotty record on combating terrorism. Terrorist
leader Osama bin Laden once lived in the country. And it was at a
Yemeni port in 2000 that suicide bombers in a small boat blew a hole
in the U.S. destroyer Cole, killing 17 sailors.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said Yemen is now an ally who poses no threat to the
U.S. and is "doing everything it can" to aid the war on terrorism.
Still, the administration intends to explore why the ship was sailing
unflagged and the missiles were concealed, he said.</TE>

<HD>Mudslide Kills 28 at Indonesian Resort</HD>

<DL>MOJOKERTO, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>A huge wave of mud swept through a popular hot springs resort in
Indonesia on Wednesday, killing at least 28 people, police said.
Thirty more were thought to be trapped in the debris and feared dead.</LD>
<LD>   "Witnesses said they heard a thundering sound before the mud,
mixed with rocks and wood, poured into the pools. It came so fast,"
said Lt. Col. Sobri Effendi, chief of police in Mojokerto, a town
near the resort where the disaster struck after heavy rains. The town
is near Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city, about 400 miles
east of Jakarta.</LD>
<LD>   More than 50 people were bathing at the Padusan Air Panas resort
in the village of Pacet when the mudslide hit, and some were unable
to escape because there was only one exit gate, police said.</LD>
<TE>   Rescuers, joined by more than 100 villagers, searched rivers and
streams below the resort.</TE>
<TE>   Some victims were found in a river several miles away, Effendi
said.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Hernanto, head of the search and rescue operation, said
huge boulders, thick mud and broken tree trunks were hampering rescue
efforts.</TE>
<TE>   The Muslim fasting month of Ramadan ended last week, and many
Indonesians are enjoying an extended holiday.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesia is prone to landslides during the rainy season.</TE>

<HD>Reporter Wins War Crimes Case Ruling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>THE HAGUE</DL>
<LD>A U.S. reporter won a landmark legal battle against being forced to
testify at the Hague war crimes tribunal Wednesday after he convinced
appeals court judges that it could jeopardize journalists' lives and
press freedom.</LD>
<LD>   The tribunal's appeals court set aside a subpoena compelling
former Washington Post reporter Jonathan Randal to give evidence at
former Bosnian Serb Deputy Prime Minister Radislav Brdjanin's trial,
after a lower court ordered him to testify.</LD>
<LD>   Randal interviewed Brdjanin during the 1992-95 Bosnian war and
quoted him as saying he wanted to get rid of the non-Serb population
in Banja Luka in a Post article in February 1993.</LD>
<TE>   Brdjanin was charged with playing a pivotal role in deporting,
torturing and murdering Croats and Muslims during the war. Randal
insisted that the article spoke for itself and there was no need for
him to testify.</TE>
<TE>   Randal's decision put him on a collision course with the tribunal
and highlighted concern that journalists would become targets in wars
if they were regarded as potential witnesses at tribunals.</TE>
<TE>   Randal had argued that reporters should only be compelled to
testify if their evidence was essential to determining guilt or
innocence and the information could not be obtained elsewhere.</TE>

<HD>U.N. Says Thanks a Billion, Ted</HD>
<DH>Media mogul Turner, who is honored for his mega-donation
five years ago, explains his soft spot for the world body: 'I love
the flags.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maggie Farley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>Ted Turner is the kind of guy who puts his money where his mouth is.
And it's a good thing: He's got a lot of money and a lot of mouth.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, the United Nations paid tribute to both, honoring
the media mogul for his billion-dollar donation to the organization
five years ago, which helped bring the U.S. back to the table at the
world body and stimulated a new way of corporate giving.</LD>
<LD>   Although the value of the stock Turner pledged has declined 75%,
mostly since Time Warner merged with AOL two years ago, he's still
going to make good on his promise. His original idea was to hand over
$100 million a year for 10 years, and so far the U.N. Foundation is
on target, disbursing $575 million in grants over five years. But the
foundation's board decided this year to stretch the rest of the
billion over a decade instead of five years.</LD>
<TE>   Turner may have less money these days, but his mouth is still as
active as ever. "I thought maybe I can extend [the grant] if I keep
getting richer. That's what I did for 10 years. I went from nothing
to a pile of money as high as the World Trade Center," he said
Wednesday at United Nations headquarters in New York. "And then just
like the World Trade Center -- poof! -- it was gone overnight."</TE>
<TE>   Even though he's one of the most undiplomatic guys around, he says
he's always had a thing for the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   "Since I was a little boy, I've always been very partial to the
U.N. I love the flags," the CNN founder said. From its inception, CNN
has had a news bureau at the United Nations and flown the powder-blue
U.N. banner -- along with a Georgia flag -- in front of its Atlanta
headquarters. But there's more to it.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.N. is a place for people to argue," Turner said. "As long
as we're talking to each other, even shouting at each other, we're
not shooting at each other. When the talking stops, the poop hits the
fan."</TE>
<TE>   Though ambassadors raise their eyebrows at Turner's way of putting
things, some say they secretly wish they could say what he says.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it takes a billion bucks," said one diplomat at the
Wednesday lunch. "But I'm glad somebody out there is doing it."</TE>
<TE>   With his Rhett Butler mustache and Southern swagger to match,
Turner is alternately jaw-droppingly politically incorrect and
indisputably charming, each barb softened by a bad-boy smile.</TE>
<TE>   At a dinner honoring him two years ago, Turner was introduced to
the Israeli ambassador and promptly asked the envoy, in a voice that
carried across the room, when Israeli soldiers were going to stop
shooting at "kids throwing rocks." At Wednesday's luncheon, he looked
at Russian envoy Sergei V. Lavrov and said, "Hey Mr. Ambassador from
Moscow, when are we going to stop pointing our missiles at each
other?"</TE>
<TE>   But he's a good guy, all heart, who would rather die than hurt
anybody, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Although he doesn't disagree with the Bush administration's
strategy on Iraq, especially its willingness to work through the
U.N., he wants to give Saddam Hussein the benefit of the doubt. If he
had a chance to chat with the Iraqi president, he said, he would
advise him: "Get rid of your weapons of mass destruction. Come clean,
and turn over a new leaf." Then he would present him with a biography
of Martin Luther King Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Turner's giving is admittedly impulsive. Some say it's compulsive.</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, on a plane to New York to be honored as the United
Nations Assn.'s Man of the Year, he said, he was trying to think of
what to say in his speech. "I wanted to give them some money, then I
thought: 'It's got to be a big figure. It's got to get in the
newspapers. How about a billion?' "</TE>
<TE>   Turner called his lawyers and accountants when he landed and told
them they had 48 hours to figure out how to make it happen. When they
called back and said the U.N. could take money only from a
government, not an individual, he was relieved at first. "I said,
'Thank God,' " he recalled. It was later decided that the money would
be acceptable if funneled through a foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Turner admits that his wild ideas shock even him sometimes and
that his staff helps keep him in check. "But there's always a way to
get around it," he said with a howling laugh.</TE>
<TE>   "When I made the pledge, it was a third of what I had. Over three
years, I gave away half of what I had. Usually people wait until the
end of their life to do that -- the check is the last thing they sign
before the priest comes to say goodbye. But I was in my 50s. It was
scary. There's nothing worse than being old and broke."</TE>
<TE>   To spend his billion dollars wisely, he chose Timothy E. Wirth,
the former senator from Colorado, whom Turner had known from the days
when he was a young cable TV entrepreneur hoping to take on the
networks and Wirth served on the House telecommunications
subcommittee.</TE>
<TE>   Today, they're working to take on global goliaths. Turner and
Wirth chose to mirror the United Nations' own millennium priorities:
children's health; women and population; the environment; and peace,
security and human rights.</TE>
<TE>   A little at a time, the foundation has given more than 350 grants
designed to teach people how to improve their lives, instead of using
the money as a short-term fix. The programs include health care for
Afghan mothers, education for Bangladeshi girls, legal training in
Latin America and help for African women with HIV/AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   Turner also joined with fellow philanthropist Bill Gates, UNICEF
and other agencies in a campaign to eliminate polio and measles, and
they predict that in three years, polio will be wiped out.</TE>
<TE>   Turner and Wirth run their foundation as tightly as a business,
with a bare-bones bureaucracy and low overhead. They follow up the
programs' performance and put together new partnerships. It's a new
form of giving that has paved the way for other billionaires, like
Gates, to more effectively share the wealth and has attracted $150
million in additional grants from groups such as the David and Lucile
Packard Foundation to be funneled through the U.N. Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   For an encore, two years ago Turner whipped out his checkbook
again to solve a long-running dispute over what the United Nations
said the U.S. owed the world body and what Congress was willing to
pay. With then-U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, he worked out a
last-minute compromise: Turner would contribute the $30-plus-million
difference, and the U.N. would adjust the percentage and timing of
Washington's dues payments.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.N.-U.S. relationship is sounder than it's ever been," said
Wirth.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Plans for Full Turkey Access Lose Ground</HD>
<DH>A top official refuses to commit to extensive military
support amid signs that Bush's bid to speed Islamic nation's entry
into EU is failing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Richter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>American plans for moving large numbers of ground troops through
Turkey in the event of a war with Iraq seemed in jeopardy Wednesday
amid growing signs that President Bush's efforts to bring Turkey
quickly into the European Union are failing.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the president's personal lobbying campaign, the European
Union is expected at a summit today and Friday to reject Turkey's
request for quick entry into the organization. Anticipating this
outcome, angry Turkish officials have warned this week that a snub
from Europe will make it difficult for them to give extensive
military support for a war that most of their citizens would oppose.
U.S. officials have said that the preferred war plan for Iraq depends
on being able to move troops through Turkey.</LD>
<LD>   The problems emerged Tuesday, when Bush was unable at a White
House meeting to persuade Turkey's top political leader, Recep Tayyip
Erdogan, to commit to providing the U.S. military the access it
wants, a U.S. official said. Erdogan held his ground, though Bush was
"angry" and "frustrated," the official said.</LD>
<TE>   And U.S. hopes that the European Union might treat Turkey more
favorably were damaged when the Turkish press reported Wednesday that
Bush had again criticized the government of German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder to Erdogan.</TE>
<TE>   The Germans, who have angered the administration by repeatedly
criticizing U.S. policy toward Iraq, are the most important obstacle
to an early Turkish entry into the EU.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have been conducting a concerted campaign to win
Turkish permission to stage a military invasion from Turkey into
northern Iraq in the event of a war. If the United States wants to
invade northern Iraq, "there is no other option," Deputy Defense
Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz said last week during a trip to Turkey.
On that trip, Wolfowitz expressed optimism that the Turks would agree
to U.S. requests.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. forces have already been making extensive use of Turkish air
bases, including the huge base at Incirlik, since the 1991 Persian
Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   But with Turkish opinion clearly against assisting the U.S. in any
new war against Iraq, a divided Turkish government has said only that
it would provide some military support if the Iraqis break their
pledge to the United Nations to disarm.</TE>
<TE>   In hopes of winning over the Turks, Bush has lobbied European
leaders to vote for early accession talks with Turkey at the summit
meeting in Copenhagen. Bush on Wednesday telephoned Danish Prime
Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who currently holds the EU
presidency, to argue that Turkey should be brought into the union.</TE>
<TE>   United Nations officials, meanwhile, have hoped that Turkey's
desire to join the EU would sway the nation to use its influence to
persuade Turkish residents of Cyprus to agree to a peace proposal
that would end decades of strife on the Mediterranean island. U.N.
officials have been pressing Turkey to do its part to win a deal
during the summit.</TE>
<TE>   But hopes for simultaneous deals on Cyprus and Turkey have faded
amid signs that most EU countries want to slow, if not stop, Turkey's
entry into the organization.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, a majority of EU foreign ministers said during a
meeting in Brussels that they favor a German-French proposal to begin
Turkish accession talks in 2005, if Turkey passes a human rights
review in 2004. European leaders are already struggling with the
costs of bringing Eastern European countries into the bloc, and they
believe that Turkey's poverty and cultural differences would make it
too much to absorb.</TE>
<TE>   But the Turks have rejected the idea of waiting until 2005 to
begin what could be years of negotiations on accession. The U.S. has
joined them in arguing that talks should begin next year.</TE>
<TE>   In recent talks, Turkish officials have been urging their U.S.
counterparts to enlist other Islamic nations to join a military
coalition, in order to make it easier for the Turks, U.S. officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   But some members of Congress, and Bush, have taken the view that
as a long-standing ally through the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, Turkey has a greater obligation to provide military
help, according to U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. official said that the Turkish warnings and threats have
been, in part, tactics aimed at winning more favorable treatment
during the summit. He said the issue is still "in play."</TE>
<TE>   But he said U.S. officials believe that the chances of closing
these deals are diminishing.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials "are disappointed," said one administration
official, who asked to remain anonymous. "An opportunity is slipping
away, and it's a historic opportunity" to bring Turkey into the EU.</TE>
<TE>   After meeting with Bush on Tuesday, Erdogan, who heads the Justice
and Development Party, flew to New York to meet with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan about Cyprus. But officials said the
meeting did not go well, and on Wednesday, a spokesman said U.N.
officials no longer expected that the peace deal would be signed
during the EU summit this week.</TE>
<TE>   Erdogan, who is likely to become prime minister next year, also
told reporters that he might decide the issue of military aid to the
United States by calling a referendum in Turkey. Such a move would
likely lead to a rejection because in a recent poll by the Pew
Research Center, 83% of Turks said they opposed allowing the U.S. to
use Turkish bases to invade Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   If the EU postpones the talks with Turkey, "this is going to be
ugly for the administration," said Bulent Aliriza, a director of the
Turkey Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies
in Washington. "A Turkey left out of the EU is going to be less
amenable to the West, because the United States is part of the West."</TE>
<TE>   Erdogan also raised the possibility that Turkey would try to
accelerate its economic development by joining the North American
Free Trade Agreement. But many observers believe that would fail.</TE>

<HD>Mediators Warn of More Violence in Venezuela</HD>
<DH>They fault the government for downplaying a national strike
and say a compromise must be reached soon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. Christian Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>Government envoys have downplayed the seriousness of a national
strike that has crippled oil production in Venezuela, complicating
negotiations on the crisis and raising the chances for violence, the
talks' mediators said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   In remarks that highlighted the growing urgency of the standoff
between President Hugo Chavez and his opponents, Cesar Gaviria, head
of the Organization of American States, said a failure to reach an
accord in the next few days could lead to food shortages, looting and
riots.</LD>
<LD>   "I think both sides have to negotiate soon, in the next few days,
or we will find increasing demands by the opposition that may take
Venezuela to a confrontation with a high risk of violence," Gaviria
said, in his strongest comments yet on the possibility of bloodshed
in this country's 10-day-old strike.</LD>
<TE>   The protest is the latest chapter in a sometimes bloody battle
that pits Chavez, a strident leftist, against a determined though
fragmented opposition of unions, businesses, civic groups and
ordinary Venezuelans.</TE>
<TE>   Gaviria said government representatives maintain that the strike
has had no effect, while opposition negotiators insist that the only
solution to the crisis is early presidential elections.</TE>
<TE>   The gap between the two sides confirmed fears of a deepening
political crisis in the country, which produces about 15% of all U.S.
petroleum imports.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents said the strike would continue today for an 11th day.</TE>
<TE>   Government negotiators "say there is no strike. They say everyone
is working, that what we have is sabotage in the oil industry,"
Gaviria said. "Because they have such different views of reality, it
is very difficult to have an agreement."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday night, Gaviria called the day's discussions
"stimulating" but said the sides had reached no agreement. He said
they would continue discussing the possibility of early elections
today.</TE>
<TE>   Originally, the opposition had sought a February referendum on
Chavez's rule. But now negotiators are seeking early presidential
elections, encouraged by the strike's success and angry at government
actions.</TE>
<TE>   One negotiator said the opposition is proposing that Chavez resign
and that the February referendum be a vote on when and whether to
hold a constitutional amendment to allow for his replacement. The
negotiator acknowledged that the two sides aren't close on an
agreement but predicted that that would change.</TE>
<TE>   "The water is only to his mouth. We think that by Saturday, it
will be at his nose," said Rafael Alfonso, an opposition negotiator
representing the national Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez, however, spent Wednesday fiercely trying to break the
strike, especially the paralysis at the state oil company, Petroleos
de Venezuela, better known as PDVSA.</TE>
<TE>   Armed commandos stormed two of 13 state oil tankers affected by
the strike. New captains were installed, but a merchant marine
representative insisted that the tankers remained anchored.</TE>
<TE>   However, Rafael Ramirez, the minister of energy and mines, said
several non-state-owned tankers loaded with crude were bound for the
United States and the Bahamas, the first such shipments in days. At
least three other tankers were loading, he said.</TE>
<TE>   A triumphant Chavez appeared at the presidential palace late in
the afternoon to announce that the strike was being defeated.</TE>
<TE>   In incendiary remarks, which have been typical on both sides, he
compared the strikers to leftist Colombian guerrillas who have blown
up oil facilities, accusing them of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The state television station also began running ads attacking the
oil company's profit margins, suggesting that it is filled with
corrupt bureaucrats.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important thing is that we are overcoming this crisis,"
Chavez said as he picked up a little girl, kissed her and asked her
what she wanted for Christmas. "It's a demonstration of great
strength."</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the day, after another peaceful protest march,
opposition leaders insisted that the strike continued to be a
success. They said 72% of the state's crude oil production, 83% of
natural gas production and more than 90% of refinery operations
remained shut down.</TE>
<TE>   The day ended with a massive cacerolazo, in which Venezuelans
banged on pots and pans to raise an overwhelming tintinnabulation of
protest.</TE>

<HD>'Honor Killings' on Rise in Pakistan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Pakistan's main human rights group said Wednesday that at least 461
women have been slain by family members in so-called honor killings
this year, about 25% more than last year.</LD>
<LD>   In such killings, women are murdered to protect the "family honor"
for "offenses" such as having sex outside marriage, dating, talking
to men, being raped or even cooking poorly.</LD>
<LD>   The 2002 figure is up from about 370 honor killings in 2001 and
demonstrates the need for increased protection for women in Pakistan,
the private Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said.</LD>
<TE>   It said the increase also shows an apparent lack of commitment by
the government to fight the practice. The government has made
repeated promises to improve women's rights.</TE>
<TE>   Kamla Hayyat, a senior official with the commission, said that the
number of killings may be much higher and that her group is compiling
a report on crimes against women.</TE>
<TE>   She also noted that the increase in recorded killings might also
be the result of an increased willingness by family and friends to
report the crime as opposition to the practice grows in some areas of
the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "We are mainly relying on the data collected from the two
provinces -- Punjab and Sindh," Hayyat said. The 2001 figures are
also based on reports from those provinces.</TE>
<TE>   She said the commission doesn't have enough resources to operate
in Baluchistan and the North-West Frontier -- deeply conservative
provinces that share a border with Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that those conservative regions were not included in the
tally suggests that the number of killings is higher.</TE>

<HD>Tech Jobs Become State's Unwanted Big Export</HD>
<DH>Hit hard in the global bust, California may see some
employment move overseas for good.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Evelyn Iritani and Marla Dickerson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From Silicon Valley to Boston's Route 128, technology companies are
waiting for a rebound in business spending to pull them out of their
slump. But when the Bay Area and other regional hotbeds emerge from
the deep hole left by the technology crash, they'll find that the
landscape looks a lot different. Many of the jobs lost will not be
back.</LD>
<LD>   The global tech bust has forced a dramatic restructuring of the
industry as firms struggle to return to profitability. Companies have
shed thousands of jobs in the United States and Europe while shifting
production to lower-cost countries, mostly in Asia.</LD>
<LD>   Like makers of apparel and toys before them, technology companies
say their survival depends increasingly on performing all but the
most sophisticated tasks offshore.</LD>
<TE>   From its peak of 5.7 million jobs in early 2001, U.S. technology
employment has plunged by about half a million. More than 100,000 of
the job losses have come in California, according to figures from the
American Electronics Assn., a Washington trade group. Most of these
positions have been in high-tech manufacturing, in which the average
wage tops $70,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of those job losses are permanent," said Daniel Wilson, an
economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. "The
natural cycle of companies moving production offshore got
accelerated."</TE>
<TE>   Experts say tech companies that weather the shakeout will emerge
leaner, meaner and more profitable for their pains. And few doubt
Silicon Valley will remain a world leader in innovation.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the transformation poses serious challenges for states such
as California, which have looked to the technology sector to generate
employment, exports and tax revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "California is not a low-cost place to do business," said Walter
Reichert, director of international relations and trade policy at
Hewlett-Packard Co., which has shed 16,000 jobs as part of a global
restructuring triggered by its merger with Compaq Computer Corp.
"Like our colleagues at IBM and Sun, we tend to keep our engineering
here. But for any kind of assembly work, we've got to look at other
possibilities."</TE>
<TE>   Although many believe the worst is over, the cuts still keep
coming. In recent months, big names such as Hewlett-Packard, Advanced
Micro Devices Inc., Sun Microsystems Inc., Applied Materials Inc. and
Agere Systems Inc. have announced layoffs totaling more than 12,000
jobs here and abroad. In early August, IBM Corp. confirmed it had
slashed 15,600 jobs from its workforce this year.</TE>
<TE>   Plunging global demand for technology equipment, coupled with
production shifts offshore, have wreaked havoc on U.S. exports.
Shipments of computers and electronic products, which account for
one-quarter of America's exports, dropped 16% in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   California's exports have been walloped even harder. Technology is
the state's No. 1 export, accounting for more than half of its sales
overseas at the height of the boom. After reaching a record $61.4
billion in 2000, California's exports of high-tech goods plunged 18%
in 2001 and are down 23% through the first three quarters of this
year.</TE>
<TE>   "California technology firms have to outsource to stay competitive
-- that absolutely makes sense," said Ross DeVol, director of
regional and demographic studies for the Santa Monica-based Milken
Institute. "On the other hand, these production activities are
increasingly taking place abroad. We're losing employment. We're
losing income. We're losing the tax receipts."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the meltdown in California's tech sector has huge
implications for the state's economy. Although California's drop in
overall employment has been milder than that of the nation as a
whole, a disproportionate share of its declines has come in high-paid
sectors such as information technology, telecommunications and
computer services, leaving the state much worse off in terms of
income than the rest of the country.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers in Sacramento used a variety of gimmicks to cover a
$24-billion deficit this year, only to find themselves faced with
another $20-billion-plus chasm heading into the next budget cycle.
That's partly the result of the state's heavy reliance on tax revenue
from capital gains, stock options and bonuses. At its peak in 2000,
revenue from these sources soared to $17.6 billion -- accounting for
25% of California's general fund.</TE>
<TE>   But those revenues have fizzled with the bursting of the tech and
stock market bubbles. State officials, who committed to billions in
new spending when coffers were flush, found themselves staring at a
yawning deficit almost overnight.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a 100-year bonanza ... and we spent it," said Ted Gibson,
former chief economist for the California Department of Finance, who
is an economic advisor at Metropolitan West Securities in Sacramento.
"Now it's reality-check time."</TE>
<TE>   Gibson says the eye-popping gains in personal income and job
growth that characterized the late 1990s in California are unlikely
to be repeated anytime soon. Silicon Valley remains mired in what may
be the worst downturn in its history.</TE>
<TE>   The San Jose metropolitan area alone has lost more than 100,000
jobs since its pre- recession peak in December 2000, while
unemployment has risen to a 19-year high of 7.9%. The Silicon Valley
Manufacturing Group, an alliance of technology firms, projects that
it will be at least five years before employment in Silicon Valley
returns to its previous peak.</TE>
<TE>   "Any of us who think we're going to have the kind of prosperity
and instant wealth and job creation we saw in the late 1990s is
really kidding themselves," said Rick White, chief executive of
TechNet, a Palo Alto-based technology industry lobbying group. "There
is still a lot of overcapacity and restructuring" ahead.</TE>
<TE>   The turn of fortune has been brutal for workers such as Richard
Jerry. The former technician at Applied Materials once earned nearly
$30 an hour building test fixtures for the Santa Clara, Calif.,
semiconductor equipment maker. Laid off for more than a year, his
savings and unemployment benefits exhausted, Jerry recently moved
into a Bay Area homeless shelter. Still, the 43-year-old harbors
dreams of returning to "the best job I ever had."</TE>
<TE>   "All we need is another upturn" in business, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Chances are, it won't be so simple. Experts say what began as a
cyclical slump has forced permanent structural changes to the U.S.
industry that won't be undone when business revives.</TE>
<TE>   Companies such as Hewlett-Packard, Cisco Systems Inc. and Motorola
Inc. for years have outsourced production to contract manufacturers
such as Flextronics International Ltd. and Solectron Corp., which in
turn are rapidly shifting their operations to lower-cost foreign
facilities as profits have plunged.</TE>
<TE>   Customers are being squeezed, "so we're being squeezed," said Jim
Sacherman, the San Jose-based chief marketing officer for
Flextronics, which has cut thousands of jobs and closed plants. The
multinational company announced Friday that it would shutter a plant
in Irvine that makes printed circuit boards.</TE>
<TE>   "Even when things turn around," Sacherman added, "it's not like
all of a sudden we're going to pick up all that and bring it back."</TE>
<TE>   Others are following suit. After growing 50% to 60% a year during
the boom times, Milpitas, Calif.-based Solectron has shed 35,000 jobs
in the last two years, most of them in North America and Europe,
while expanding production at its three facilities in China.</TE>
<TE>   And the list goes on. Fiber- optic equipment maker JDS Uniphase
Corp., with headquarters in San Jose and Ottawa, has beefed up its
Chinese operations while sacking more than 20,000 workers in the U.S.
and Canada. Santa Clara-based National Semiconductor Corp., which has
shed 1,100 employees and contractors, most of them manufacturing
employees in the U.S. and Scotland, just broke ground on a new chip
plant in Suzhou, China, that will employ 500. Motorola Inc., which
slashed 7,000 jobs this year, has aggressively shifted its chip
production to contract manufacturers in Asia. The Schaumberg,
Ill.-based company plans to invest $1.3 billion in research and
development facilities in China during the next four years.</TE>
<TE>   Some say the U.S. has no choice but to keep climbing the knowledge
ladder, focusing on production of higher-value software and services
and pouring billions of dollars into new arenas such as biomedicine,
nanotechnology and the wireless Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "Manufacturing is not just people with dirty hands in a grimy
building making widgets," said Doug Henton, president of Silicon
Valley-based Collaborative Economics. "It could be people at a
computer manufac- turing software.... We're still making things. But
what we make is different, and how we make it is different."</TE>
<TE>   Yet others say California's high costs and inhospitable business
climate have helped accelerate high-tech manufacturing's move away
from the Golden State. Carl Guardino, president of the Silicon Valley
Manufacturing Group, said too many state officials seem unable to
grasp that much of the technology wealth created in California has
come not just from design of computers and other high-tech products
but from their production and export.</TE>
<TE>   Cut too deep into the manufacturing base, and Silicon Valley could
lose its ability to maintain its technological predominance, he
warns.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like renting a horse and dressing up like Paul Revere,"
Guardino said. "Too many folks are taking for granted what is at
stake here."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the state faces huge challenges in retaining, much less
expanding, its high-tech production. California's tax structure
motivates sales-tax-hungry communities to favor strip malls and auto
dealers over factories. Lofty electricity rates, workers'
compensation costs and real estate prices have made the state's
business costs among the highest in the nation. And looming budget
deficits mean that businesses' fees and taxes are likely to go up in
the near term, rather than down.</TE>
<TE>   Although the recent job losses largely have been in lower-cost
commodity goods such as semiconductors, cell phones and computer
components, even higher-value products face stepped-up competition
from places such as China and India, which have invested in
scientific education and other infrastructure crucial for technology
firms.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, it's not just production jobs going abroad. A growing
number of U.S. companies, including Dell Computer Corp., General
Electric Co. and Citibank, have shifted call centers and other
information technology service operations offshore to slash costs.</TE>
<TE>   A recent report by Cambridge, Mass.-based Forrester Research
projects that 3.3 million positions, in activities from credit card
processing and back-office accounting to software development,
computer programming and engineering, will migrate to countries such
as India, Russia and China in the next 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   If the United States wants to stay on the cutting edge, it must do
a better job of educating its workforce, particularly in science,
mathematics and physics, said William Archey, president and chief
executive of the American Electronics Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to do something that makes the idea of engineering and
science far more attractive to young kids," he said. "I have jokingly
said, instead of 'L.A. Law,' we need 'L.A. Geek.' "</TE>
<TE>   Unless some difficult choices are made, experts warn, the U.S.,
and particularly states such as California, could be left on the
sidelines of producing the next "new thing."</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to be able to stop production from leaving the
state, but we've got to make some decisions about what we want to
keep here," said DeVol of the Milken Institute.</TE>
<TE>   "If we just throw our arms up and say, 'It's the inevitable
sequence of events that this production goes to low-cost countries,'
then that's what will happen."</TE>

<HD>Anthrax Tests Set at Capital Mail Facility</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>More than a year after anthrax killed two workers in the main mail
handling center for the capital, decontamination work involving
chlorine dioxide gas is to begin Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The 17.5-million-cubic-foot Brentwood facility has been closed
since October 2001, when anthrax-laced letters to members of Congress
were processed there.</LD>
<LD>   Safety was the top concern as the decontamination process was
planned, said Tom Day, the Postal Service's vice president of
engineering.</LD>
<TE>   "Every time we had a choice, we went on the side of doing it
safer, rather than faster," he said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   A 282-yard safety perimeter will be set up around the building and
an Environmental Protection Agency vehicle that monitors trace
atmospheric gases also will patrol the area.</TE>
<TE>   Crews in protective gear eventually will collect more than 8,000
spore strips from 4,000 locations over 20 to 30 days.</TE>
<TE>   The strips will be sent to a lab for testing, with the results
analyzed by a committee led by officials from the District of
Columbia's Public Health Department and the EPA. No one from the
Postal Service will be on the committee, Day said.</TE>
<TE>   Only when the results show zero growth of anthrax spores will the
building be deemed clean.</TE>
<TE>   The Postal Service will do some remodeling and equipment
maintenance, expected to take three to four months. If everything
goes as planned, Day said postal workers could be back in the
building by late April.</TE>

<HD>1 Chickenpox Vaccination May Fall Short</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Doctors may need to give two doses of the chickenpox vaccine instead
of one, experts said Wednesday after a study showed a single dose has
a far higher failure rate than previously thought.</LD>
<LD>   Karin Galil of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
calculated that the vaccine failed to protect 56% of children who got
the shot. In previous studies, the failure rate ranged from zero to
29%.</LD>
<LD>   Galil's study found that chickenpox spread rapidly through
vaccinated children in a New Hampshire day-care center.</LD>
<TE>   "This outbreak constitutes a warning signal," Anne Gershon of the
Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York
wrote in a commentary in the New England Journal of Medicine, which
also published the CDC study.</TE>
<TE>   She said a second shot may be necessary to provide meaningful
protection, although Gershon noted that studies were needed to see if
the cost was worth the benefit.</TE>
<TE>   "The time for exploring the possibility of routinely administering
two doses of varicella [chickenpox] vaccine to children seems to have
arrived," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Chickenpox causes headache, fever and, eventually, a rash that
leads to itchy red spots that are filled with fluid before they crust
over and disappear.</TE>
<TE>   While parents often view it as a benign disease, chickenpox can
lead to pneumonia, inflammation of the brain and skin infections.
Before the vaccine was licensed in 1995, chickenpox sent 11,000
people to the hospital each year and killed 100. Half of the
fatalities were children.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the number of hospitalizations for chickenpox has
plummeted by 80%, according to the CDC researchers.</TE>
<TE>   Chickenpox spreads easily through the air, and a child can be
contagious three days before symptoms appear.</TE>
<TE>   About 75% of U.S. children have received the chickenpox vaccine.
It is required for school-age children in 26 states, and four others
-- Louisiana, New Hampshire, Nevada and New York -- will require it
next year.</TE>
<TE>   It is not unusual for children to get more than one vaccine dose
-- it takes two doses to control measles and several doses for polio
and hepatitis.</TE>

<HD>Texas Court to Review Order Letting Camera in Jury Room</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Texas' top appeals court said Wednesday it will review a judge's
decision to allow a camera record jury deliberations of a capital
murder trial.</LD>
<LD>   State District Judge Ted Poe ruled last month that a camera from
the PBS documentary series "Frontline" could record the entire murder
trial of 17-year-old Cedric Harrison, including jury selection and
deliberations.</LD>
<LD>   Harris County Dist. Atty. Chuck Rosenthal appealed to the Texas
Court of Criminal Appeals, saying that allowing a camera in the jury
room would fundamentally change the judicial process by invading what
traditionally is a secret process.</LD>
<TE>   After requesting a response from Poe to objections raised by
Rosenthal, the Austin-based appeals court scheduled oral arguments
for Jan. 15.</TE>
<TE>   The general counsel for the court, Richard Wetzel, said Poe and
Rosenthal each will get the standard 20 minutes to present arguments.
He said "Frontline" will not address the court.</TE>
<TE>   "They are not an official party any more than Mr. Harrison is,"
Wetzel said of "Frontline."</TE>
<TE>   Jury selection in Harrison's trial is on hold pending a ruling by
the appellate court. He is accused of fatally shooting Felix G. Sabio
II, 35, on June 2 outside Sabio's apartment. Prosecutors are seeking
the death penalty.</TE>

<HD>New FDA Chief Vows Tougher Action on Deceptive Drug Ads</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vicki Kemper</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The new commissioner of the often-maligned Food and Drug
Administration, declaring his agency independent of both drug
manufacturers and consumer advocates, pledged Wednesday to take
tougher and quicker action against misleading drug ads and dietary
supplement labels.</LD>
<LD>   "We do have authority and we intend to use it," said Dr. Mark B.
McClellan, a Texas-born physician and economist named by President
Bush to fill the almost 2-year-old vacancy at the helm of the FDA.
"We will not be afraid to go to court when necessary."</LD>
<LD>   In his first extended conversation with reporters since taking
over the FDA last month, McClellan said he also would work to
streamline the "science-driven" agency's drug-approval process,
shortening the time and reducing the cost of getting new drugs to
market. With a budget of $2.7 billion for regulating food safety,
drug safety and efficacy and -- most recently -- licensing vaccines
and antidotes to bioterrorism agents such as smallpox and anthrax,
the FDA has regulatory authority over products comprising nearly a
quarter of the nation's economy.</LD>
<TE>   And with technical advances in almost every area, including
genetically engineered foods and new medical treatments, the
complexity of the agency's tasks is only increasing, McClellan said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the areas where the FDA's work touches consumers most
directly are labeling of food and dietary supplements and testing,
approval and advertising of drugs.</TE>
<TE>   The question of cracking down on misleading advertising responds
directly to a government report issued last week and goes to the
heart of what McClellan described as the FDA's key mission: promoting
and protecting public health.</TE>
<TE>   The report by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm
of Congress, concluded that the agency's process for taking action
against companies that aired or printed misleading advertisements
about their drugs was so slow as to be ineffective.</TE>
<TE>   In many cases, the report found, a company's ad campaign ran its
course during the time the general counsel's office of the FDA
reviewed letters warning companies to stop running the deceptive ads
-- a process lengthened under the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   Drug companies spent $2.7 billion last year on so-called
direct-to-consumer ads, which are aired on television and printed in
newspapers and magazines. That is triple the amount spent on such ads
in 1997, when the FDA loosened its rules.</TE>
<TE>   Studies have linked the ads to a huge increase in the number of
patients who ask their doctors for a specific drug by name.</TE>
<TE>   As an example, the anti-cholesterol drug Lipitor, manufactured by
Pfizer, was the nation's second-best selling drug in 2000, ringing up
more than $41 billion in sales. Yet the FDA has cited Pfizer four
times over the past four years for suggesting, misleadingly, that
Lipitor could also reduce the risk of heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   McClellan defended the drug ads aimed directly at consumers,
saying they lead to increased visits for such under-treated diseases
as depression, high blood pressure and diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   But "we are not backing off on our policy of enforcing the law"
against deceptive advertising, he said. "If we see patterns of
misleading advertising we are going to take more action."</TE>
<TE>   He said he hoped to improve the process of drug safety.</TE>
<TE>   By conducting early tests to see if drug formulas contain
"markers" -- chemical properties known to cause dangerous side
effects, such as liver damage -- McClellan said the agency could
speed up later testing phases and make them less costly.</TE>
<TE>   He said he also wants to improve the FDA's collection of
information about dangerous side effects so that drugs causing such
damage can be withdrawn from the market more quickly.</TE>
<TE>   McClellan cited America's ballooning obesity problem and said he
also wants to help Americans make better health-care choices.</TE>

<HD>Bush Proposal Would Speed Forest Thinning</HD>
<DH>Bush's fire-prevention policy would curtail environmental
reviews and public appeals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Shogren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration Wednesday unveiled a fire-prevention policy
built on scaling back environmental reviews and public appeals that
now block the thinning of forests on most federal land.</LD>
<LD>   Under the proposed rules, many thinning projects could go ahead
without thorough environmental impact assessments, as are now
required, even if they are being challenged by government employees
or members of the public.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the administration's far-reaching proposals could take
effect after public comment periods of 30 to 60 days. They would not
need congressional approval to take on the force of law. Congress
failed to act earlier when Bush sought legislation accomplishing
similar goals.</LD>
<TE>   The regulations are aimed at reducing the risk of catastrophic
wildfires like those that scorched 7.1 million acres of public and
private land last summer, according to administration officials.</TE>
<TE>   "We're dealing with an emergency situation," Interior Secretary
Gale A. Norton said at a White House briefing.</TE>
<TE>   The policy changes are based on the advice of the federal
foresters who manage the national parks, forests, monuments and
refuges and most other federal lands affected by the rules, according
to officials. These foresters pleaded for the removal of some of the
obstacles to thinning the forests of the undergrowth that often
becomes a fire's chief fuel, sometimes making them so hot that
firefighters cannot get close to them.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand some of the things that need to be done in the
forests so we don't have such devastating fires in the future," said
Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman, who oversees the national
forests.</TE>
<TE>   The logging industry praised the administration for trying to
remove obstacles to thinning projects.</TE>
<TE>   "It's critically important to recognize that the most significant
environmental problem facing forests is the risk of catastrophic
fire," said David Bischel, president of the California Forestry
Assn., which represents private forest landowners and forest product
manufacturers. "We can't just keep our hands in our pockets while our
forests burn."</TE>
<TE>   But environmentalists attacked the proposal as an effort to
exclude the public from decision-making and to reintroduce wide-scale
logging on public lands.</TE>
<TE>   "They are throwing out environmental review for the large majority
of the most controversial projects that the Forest Service does,"
said Nathaniel Lawrence, a forest expert for the Natural Resources
Defense Council, a national environmental group. "That is truly
shocking, and people should be outraged that secretaries say they
should dispense with environmental review for giant categories of
logging."</TE>
<TE>   Some foresters embraced the proposals as a positive effort to
remove the bureaucratic obstacles that hamstring them from managing
forests.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to help get forest managers away from their desks and
into the forests," said Michael Goergen, policy director of the
Society of American Foresters, which represents 17,000 foresters
across the country. "Hopefully they'll be able to put plans in place
and take actions on the ground that will reduce the risk of
catastrophic wildfire."</TE>
<TE>   The administration said it would immediately apply some of its new
policies to 10 projects now undergoing review, including two in
California. One project would thin trees around homes in the
Mendocino National Forest, north of San Francisco. The other would
remove brush and small trees in the Eldorado National Forest east of
the community of Grizzly Flat, not far from Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Watson, California director of the Wilderness Society, said
his group would support streamlined decision-making for thinning
projects near populated areas. But he said he had no confidence that
the administration would limit itself to such projects, given the
sweeping nature of the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "It actually gives the Forest Service a green light to cut timber
anywhere it pleases," Watson said.</TE>
<TE>   The administration previewed its vision for thinning forests last
week when it unveiled its plan for managing the Sequoia National
Monument, environmentalists said.</TE>
<TE>   The plan proposes taking out trees that are generally no larger
than 30 inches in diameter.</TE>
<TE>   The administration said its goal is to leave behind healthy
forests. That might mean removing some old trees along with skinny
trees and underbrush in order to make forests more fire-resistant.</TE>
<TE>   "Focus not on what we take from the forests but how we leave the
forests," Veneman said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M.), the incoming chairman of the
Energy and Natural Resources Committee, applauded the
administration's announcement.</TE>
<TE>   "It will help federal land managers work to save wildlife habitat
and maintain the watersheds that are so important to our
communities," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Domenici said Congress should do more to expedite the thinning of
forests. Congress is considering a plan that would grant commercial
logging companies long-term contracts that would allow them to take
out enough big trees when conducting thinning projects to make them
economically feasible.</TE>
<TE>   James Connaughton, chairman of the White House's Council on
Environmental Quality, said Wednesday's plan would have only a modest
effect on public lands unless Congress approves the long-term
contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials say that more of the 190 million acres
nationwide are at high risk for forest fires.</TE>
<TE>   Federal funds now available will address only a few million acres
a year, even with the proposed changes, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials said long-term contracts would give
logging companies the confidence they need to invest in new
technology necessary to make thinning projects economically viable.
And then, more thinning could take place.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists said that for the Bush administration,
"thinning" is a euphemism for commercial logging.</TE>

<HD>More 9/11 Clues Were Overlooked</HD>
<DH>Report cites missed signals about terrorists headed to U.S.
and a hijacker's phone calls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Greg Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. intelligence had information months before the Sept. 11 attacks
that an Al Qaeda operative now seen as the mastermind of the plot was
planning to send terrorists to the United States, according to a
highly anticipated congressional report.</LD>
<LD>   A year before the attacks, the United States had also intercepted
phone calls from one of the hijackers to a suspected terrorist
facility in the Middle East, but failed to realize until after Sept.
11 that the calls had come from one of the San Diego-based hijackers,
congressional sources said.</LD>
<LD>   The revelations were among more findings released Wednesday by a
joint congressional panel that has spent much of the last year
investigating Sept. 11 intelligence failures.</LD>
<TE>   The report paints a disturbing portrait of a U.S. spy community
too hobbled by Cold War habits and myopic policies to fully
comprehend the emerging terrorist threat to the United States. It
urged a host of reforms, including the creation of a Cabinet-level
intelligence position.</TE>
<TE>   "The intelligence community was not properly postured to meet the
threat of global terrorism against the people of the United States,"
said Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), outgoing chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The report represents the culmination of a high-profile probe in
which investigators examined half a million intelligence documents
and conducted more than 600 interviews.</TE>
<TE>   But the materials released Wednesday -- including nine pages of
findings and 15 pages of recommendations -- represent only a portion
of the final product.</TE>
<TE>   The bulk of the 450-page report remains classified, and it is
unclear whether lawmakers will succeed in persuading the White House
and intelligence agencies to release substantial portions of it to
the public.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, much of the information presented Wednesday was in
summary form, offering tantalizing glimpses of material uncovered
during the investigation, but making it difficult to fully assess the
meaning of that material.</TE>
<TE>   Graham and others stressed that there is no evidence that any
agency had collected information indicating the time, place and
nature of the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But through a series of public hearings and sharply worded
reports, the congressional inquiry has significantly eroded early
claims by intelligence officials that the hijackers' planning was so
sophisticated, and the plot so unimaginable, that preventing it would
have been almost impossible.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the findings issued Wednesday had been previously
reported. Among them are the FBI's failure to heed warnings from
agents in Arizona that terrorists might be training at U.S. flight
schools. The report also repeated criticism of the CIA for failing to
notify the FBI or other domestic agencies that two Al Qaeda
operatives had entered the country in early 2000.</TE>
<TE>   But several findings had not been previously disclosed. One of the
most tantalizing is the assertion that U.S. intelligence agencies
failed to recognize the significance of information collected in June
2001 on Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the Al Qaeda operative now believed
to be the architect of the Sept. 11 plot.</TE>
<TE>   The reporting suggested that Mohammed was interested in "sending
terrorists to the United States" and planning to direct their
activities once they had arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed has since been linked to a series of suspected plots,
including a 1995 scheme to crash a plane into CIA headquarters. He
has also been linked to a key planner of the 1993 World Trade Center
bombing.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed is now one of the most wanted Al Qaeda fugitives. But the
panel's report chastises the CIA for failing to see Mohammed's rising
stature in Al Qaeda. His role in the Sept. 11 attacks, the report
says, "was a surprise to the intelligence community."</TE>
<TE>   A senior U.S. intelligence official said the CIA had not examined
the report and could not comment on its contents. Several federal law
enforcement and intelligence officials said they were not familiar
with any specific piece of intelligence reporting that showed
Mohammed played a role in sending terrorists to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   But one former official said that if the CIA and the National
Security Agency had received such specific intelligence about
Mohammed, they didn't share it with others in the counter-terrorism
community.</TE>
<TE>   "They never told us about it," said the former official. "But what
type of information was it? How good was the reporting? ... If it was
vague, they probably wouldn't have, even if in hindsight it seems
significant."</TE>
<TE>   Another disclosure centers on communications between one of the
San Diego hijackers, Khalid Almihdhar, and an unidentified "terrorist
facility" in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   The nature of the communications was not specified in the report.
But congressional sources said the finding refers to intercepted
phone calls to a Middle East facility under U.S. surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   Only after the attacks, the report said, did the intelligence
community realize that the "Khaled" identified in the communications
was Khalid Almihdhar, who had previously been observed by the CIA
attending an Al Qaeda meeting in Malaysia and who died in the plane
that crashed into the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the NSA, the agency that eavesdrops on electronic
communications, did not respond to a request for comment.</TE>
<TE>   In another passage, the report says that some hijackers had
contacts inside the United States and abroad with individuals who
"were known to the FBI through either past or, at the time, ongoing
inquiries and investigations." Challenging assertions from FBI
Director Robert S. Mueller III and others, the report says the
hijackers "were not as isolated during their time in the United
States as has been previously suggested."</TE>
<TE>   Sources said some of this language refers to the San Diego
hijackers, who rented rooms from a man who was also an informant for
the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   Graham noted Wednesday that the congressional inquiry marks the
first time that House and Senate committees have combined to conduct
a joint investigation. Many in Washington have given the inquiry high
marks for the material it has uncovered.</TE>
<TE>   But the reports released Wednesday also reveal much about what
members could not accomplish.</TE>
<TE>   A list of 19 recommendations consists largely of recycled
proposals and tepid calls for further study of thorny issues members
themselves could not resolve, including whether a new domestic
intelligence agency should be created.</TE>
<TE>   For its part, the Department of Justice issued a lengthy statement
defending its performance and arguing that it should not be stripped
of its role, through the FBI, as the nation's domestic intelligence
service.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the department said it views the committee's
recommendations "as an endorsement" of reforms already underway at
the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   "While improvements are necessary and ongoing," wrote Barbara
Comstock, director of public affairs at the department, "the
department believes that the FBI is well suited to serve as the
domestic intelligence and terrorism prevention agency in the United
States."</TE>
<TE>   Members of the committee also disagreed sharply over whether
officials in the intelligence community should be held accountable
for failures documented in the report. Deep disagreement over that
issue and others prompted one of the top Republicans on the panel,
Sen. Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, to issue a 75-page dissenting
report.</TE>
<TE>   During a news conference Wednesday, Shelby heaped criticism on CIA
Director George J. Tenet and his predecessor at the agency, John M.
Deutch. He also singled out former FBI Director Louis J. Freeh, and
NSA Director Michael Hayden.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that they've got to be called to account," Shelby said.</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer dismissed Shelby's
remarks as "a one-man, minority dissent," and he said President Bush
continues to have confidence in Tenet.</TE>
<TE>   CIA spokesman Bill Harlow declined to respond directly to Shelby's
remarks but referred to Tenet's prior testimony.</TE>
<TE>   "The director said that there were things which we should have

<HD>Most of Suit Against Ky. Governor Dismissed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FRANKFORT, Ky.</DL>
<LD>A judge Wednesday dismissed most of a lawsuit filed by the owner of a
nursing home who said Gov. Paul E. Patton started a regulatory
crackdown after she ended their two-year affair.</LD>
<LD>   Dismissed were all five claims Tina Conner filed against the state
and two of the five she filed against Patton. Judge Roger Crittenden
said that Conner could not sue the governor for sexual harassment and
wasting state resources, but left intact claims of infliction of
emotional distress, outrage and defamation.</LD>
<LD>   Patton's lawyer, Sheryl Snyder, said he had not asked for the
remaining claims to be dismissed, but soon will.</LD>
<TE>   "We got everything we asked for and now we're going to ask for the
rest," Snyder said.</TE>
<TE>   Conner said Wednesday her attorney had warned her that some
elements might be thrown out. Parts of her suit were filed under a
statute that applies to state employees, which she has never been.</TE>
<TE>   "So basically everything else was left in the lawsuit and we'll
have our day in court, and that's exactly what I wanted.... I do not
consider this a loss at all," she told WAVE-TV of Louisville.</TE>
<TE>   Patton said the lawsuit would eventually show he did nothing wrong
as governor.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm confident that the outcome will be I have in no way abused
the office of governor," Patton said after the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers had objected to the state paying to defend the lawsuit,
but officials said earlier that they were confident the state would
be dismissed as a defendant.</TE>
<TE>   Conner is the owner of the Birchtree Healthcare nursing home,
which has gone into bankruptcy receivership. The state is seeking to
revoke the license of the 116-bed facility because of what it claims
are ongoing safety concerns.</TE>

<HD>As the Broadsides Continue, Lott Issues Another Apology</HD>
<DH>Incoming Senate leader calls his remarks a 'mistake.' GOP
unease over controversy grows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson and Richard Simon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>With Republicans growing increasingly nervous about their incoming
Senate majority leader, Trent Lott (R-Miss.) apologized for a second
time Wednesday for recently praising a 1948 presidential campaign
that promoted racial segregation.</LD>
<LD>   "This was a mistake of the head or of the mouth, not of the
heart," Lott said. "You know, I've asked for forgiveness, and now I
want to, you know, do the right thing in the future."</LD>
<LD>   As clamor grew that his previous amends for the statements had
been insufficient, Lott apologized in interviews broadcast on the Fox
News Channel and CNN. Earlier this week, he apologized through brief
written statements.</LD>
<TE>   His latest comments came amid an intensifying fusillade of
criticism from Democrats and concern among Republicans that Lott's
Senate job could be on the line.</TE>
<TE>   So far, no Senate Republicans have publicly called for Lott's
ouster. Privately, however, many are concerned.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a great deal of unease about where we're headed," said
one senior Senate GOP aide who requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a high level of anxiety downtown," the aide said,
referring to the White House.</TE>
<TE>   The White House has publicly refrained from criticizing Lott. But
neither has it offered a strong statement of support for a lawmaker
who, as Senate leader, will be essential to steering President Bush's
agenda through the new Congress. Bush has made no public statement on
the matter.</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer on Wednesday reiterated
Bush's support for civil rights and sidestepped questions about
whether the president is concerned about the damage that Lott's
statements may have caused the Republican Party.</TE>
<TE>   "The president ... understands and knows that America is a much
richer and better nation as a result of the changes that have been
made to our society involving integration and the improvement of
relations between races," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   Lott has been pummeled for days for saying on Dec. 5 that the
nation would have been better off if Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.),
then running as a Dixiecrat, had been elected president in 1948.</TE>
<TE>   As news of Lott's remarks spread, Lott on Monday apologized for
what he termed "a poor choice of words" at "a lighthearted
celebration" of Thurmond's 100th birthday. Lott stressed that he had
not meant to endorse segregation.</TE>
<TE>   But the controversy intensified Wednesday with the revelation that
Lott had also praised Thurmond's presidential candidacy at a public
event in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   That year, the Clarion-Ledger of Jackson, Miss., reported that
Lott had praised Thurmond during a political rally: "You know, if we
had elected this man 30 years ago, we wouldn't be in the mess we are
today."</TE>
<TE>   Those words foreshadowed what Lott said at Thurmond's party: "I
want to say this about my state: When Strom Thurmond ran for
president, we voted for him. We're proud of it. And if the rest of
the country had followed our lead, we wouldn't have had all these
problems over all these years, either."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.), a likely 2004 presidential
contender, on Wednesday became the first of Lott's Senate colleagues
to call on him to step aside as majority leader before the 108th
Congress convenes on Jan. 7.</TE>
<TE>   "I simply do not believe the country can today afford to have
someone who has made these statements again and again be the leader
of the United States Senate," Kerry said.</TE>
<TE>   Lott also came under fire in Mississippi on Wednesday when the
Clarion-Ledger, the state's largest newspaper, published a critical
editorial cartoon.</TE>
<TE>   As part of his effort to repair his image, Lott on Wednesday said
he had supported increased funding for education, election reform and
other initiatives that show his support for African Americans.</TE>
<TE>   However, many civil-rights groups deplore his legislative record,
and his recent comments cast a new light on it.</TE>
<TE>   He voted in 1983 against creating a federal holiday for slain
civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.; in 1982, he opposed an
extension of the Voting Rights Act.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, he championed Bob Jones University in South
Carolina, a private institution that at the time banned interracial
dating.</TE>
<TE>   In one instance, he filed a legal brief arguing that the Internal
Revenue Service had no right to deny Bob Jones University or other
religious schools a tax exemption based on discriminatory policies.
The Supreme Court rejected the claim.</TE>
<TE>   Lott also faced criticism in the late 1990s for his contacts with
the Council of Conservative Citizens, a group that has been attacked
by critics as a source of segregationist rhetoric.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, he described a speech he had given to the council as
a routine appearance in a public forum.</TE>
<TE>   In his interview on Fox, Lott termed his comments "terrible" and
added, "I apologize for the words, and I'm sorry that I used words
that are insensitive and conveyed an impression that is not an
accurate one."</TE>
<TE>   Lott described himself as the son of a sharecropper and a
schoolteacher who understands the troubles faced by average Americans
of all backgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   He said he hoped he would be given a chance to move past the
controversy, which he acknowledged "has become a distraction from the
things we really want to be focusing on."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said he expected Lott to remain the
leader of the 51-member Republican Senate caucus.</TE>
<TE>   "He's very effective with the caucus," McCain said. "He's good at
building relationships."</TE>
<TE>   However, McCain added that Lott's latest apologies may not be
enough.</TE>
<TE>   "He probably should hold a press conference and answer questions,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lott, 61, a three-term senator and former House member, has led
the Senate Republicans, as majority leader and minority leader, since
Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas stepped down in 1996 to run for president.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, he was unchallenged for a new two-year term as Senate
majority leader after Republicans regained the chamber in the midterm
elections.</TE>
<TE>   Should a new challenge to Lott emerge, possible candidates to
succeed him would be Sens. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Don Nickles
of Oklahoma and Bill Frist of Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   Some conservative opinion leaders fear that because of Lott, the
party has taken an irreparable hit on civil rights.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, Mr. Bush has worked hard to try to demonstrate racial
sensitivity," said Ken Connor, president of the Family Research
Council, a conservative group. "These remarks undercut that."</TE>
<TE>   William Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard, said
Lott had failed to stem the uproar.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is, can Republicans do better than Trent Lott for
the next two years as the leader in the Senate?" Kristol said. "The
answer is yes."</TE>

<HD>Mining Company Cited in Deadly Explosions</HD>
<DH>Alabama firm faces fine of up to $1.5 million for safety
violations that contributed to pair of blasts that killed 13.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TUSCALOOSA, Ala.</DL>
<LD>Federal regulators cited a mining company Wednesday for numerous
safety violations in an accident that killed 13 coal miners last
year, the worst U.S. mine accident since 1984.</LD>
<LD>   The 27 citations against Jim Walter Resources Inc. carry a maximum
fine of $1.5 million, but Dave Lauriski of the U.S. Mine Safety and
Health Administration said the agency had yet to assess a penalty.</LD>
<LD>   Eight of the violations were major and contributed to a pair of
explosions and the deaths at Blue Creek No. 5, Lauriski said. The
mine, in Brookwood, Ala., is the continent's deepest vertical-shaft
coal mine at 2,140 feet.</LD>
<TE>   The company disagreed with "significant portions" of the
administration's report on the Sept. 23, 2001, accident, said
spokesman Kyle Parks.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to be giving them more information we hope will cause
them to come to a different conclusion," Parks said.</TE>
<TE>   Key violations were the company's failure to evacuate the mine
after four men were injured in the first explosion and its failure to
prevent buildup of combustible coal dust in the mine, regulators
said. Dust buildup, Lauriski said, was a major factor in the second
explosion.</TE>
<TE>   The second blast occurred about an hour after the first one,
killing miners sent to rescue the four injured men.</TE>
<TE>   The company also was cited for inadequate supports of the mine
roof, which collapsed to cause the first explosion; inadequate safety
checks; and a failure to conduct fire drills.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Walter Resources had 31 outstanding safety violations at the
time of the accident, but the company contends that all of the
critical problems had been fixed before the blasts.</TE>
<TE>   The United Mine Workers of America has said that federal
regulators contributed to the accident by inadequate oversight and
that an internal review is being conducted to determine whether the
agency's actions played a role.</TE>
<TE>   The agency will issue broader emergency regulations to make clear
that a mine must be evacuated after an explosion that poses an
"imminent danger" to workers, Lauriski said.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Walter Resources is being sued for negligence by relatives of
10 of the 13 victims.</TE>
<TE>   The widow of miner Raymond Ashworth said the citations would not
do anything to ease the pain over the death of her husband.</TE>
<TE>   "They cannot right 13 deaths," Kathy Ashworth said after a private
briefing by regulators for the victims' relatives.</TE>

<HD>Canceling King Holiday Creates a Stir</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHESTERFIELD, Va.</DL>
<LD>Students in a Richmond suburb will make up a snow day on Martin
Luther King Jr. Day, prompting protests from the NAACP and the
American Civil Liberties Union.</LD>
<LD>   Chesterfield County School Supt. Billy K. Cannaday Jr., who is
black, announced the decision this week. He said rigorous new state
graduation requirements make it necessary for the schools to make up
snow days before testing periods begin in the spring. King Day, a
federal and state holiday that falls on Jan. 20, was the first
available date after the Christmas vacation.</LD>
<LD>   "It reinforces for me, as an African American, Dr. King's strong
belief in education as an equalizer," Cannaday said Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   Kent Willis, executive director of the Virginia ACLU, said the
decision is a matter of sensitivity to race relations.</TE>
<TE>   "I think for many it will be suspicious that the first holiday to
be sacrificed to make up for inclement weather days is Martin Luther
King Day," Willis said.</TE>
<TE>   King Salim Khalfani, state director of the National Assn. for the
Advancement of Colored People, called the decision "shortsighted and
insensitive."</TE>
<TE>   Khalfani said Cannaday needs to "reclaim his heritage and learn
something from all of this."</TE>
<TE>   "To totally dismiss [the holiday] for a snow day and say that Dr.
King was a supporter of education makes a mockery of King," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-four percent of the county's nearly 54,000 students are
black, a Chesterfield schools spokeswoman said. She said she had not
received any complaints from parents about the holiday cancellation.</TE>

<HD>New Yorkers Plan for Transit Strike</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Transportation officials across the metropolitan area scrambled
Wednesday to set up contingency plans for millions of commuters as
talks to stave off a city subway and bus strike went nowhere.</LD>
<LD>   Suburban governments set up carpool lots, corporations rented
hotel rooms for their employees and transit officials planned to
reroute trains in case 34,000 bus and subway workers walk off the job
next week.</LD>
<LD>   Negotiators for the union and the state agency that runs the
transit system spent just three hours in talks Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   The Transport Workers Union, whose contract expires Sunday, has
authorized a strike as early as Monday if a deal is not reached. Its
president said management negotiators were not budging.</TE>
<TE>   "They did not show any flexibility at the table. We've modified
our demands and they have not done likewise," said union chief Roger
Toussaint.</TE>
<TE>   He added that the union was asking for 6% annual raises over three
years instead of the 8%-a-year increase sought initially.</TE>
<TE>   The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, blaming financial woes
of the city and state, has proposed no raise in the first year and
has tied raises in the second and third years to higher productivity.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides agreed to meet today before a judge to discuss legal
issues related to a strike.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA released contingency plans that would take effect 24 hours
after a strike begins. It would convert some trains on its Long
Island and Metro-North railroads -- which normally transport suburban
commuters -- into shuttles carrying outer-borough people into and out
of Manhattan. Workers on those railroad lines are not covered by the
same contract.</TE>
<TE>   However, the agency warned commuters to prepare for crowds, lines
and delays -- and it asked that people consider working from home if
possible. The system normally moves more than 7 million people daily.</TE>
<TE>   Companies across the city were considering their options, with
some making arrangements for employees to telecommute, carpool or
stay in hotels.</TE>

<HD>Ohio Again Ordered to Equalize School Funding</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>COLUMBUS, Ohio</DL>
<LD>The Ohio Supreme Court on Wednesday declared the state's school
funding system unconstitutional for the third time in 11 years and
ordered lawmakers to fix inequities between rich and poor districts.</LD>
<LD>   In each ruling, the justices have said the state's method of
funding schools, which relies heavily on property taxes, was
unconstitutional because it favored rich districts over poor.</LD>
<LD>   Wednesday's ruling ordered lawmakers to overhaul the system, but
it didn't give lawmakers a deadline, retain jurisdiction or authorize
a lower-court monitor.</LD>
<TE>   Justice Paul E. Pfeifer, writing for the majority in the 4-3
ruling, said that although the Legislature had increased spending on
public schools, it had not met the court's original order to change
the way the state funds them.</TE>
<TE>   "Today we reiterate that that is what is needed, not further
nibbling at the edges," he wrote. "We are not unmindful of the
difficulties facing the state, but those difficulties do not trump
the Constitution."</TE>
<TE>   State officials have estimated that the cost of meeting the
court's requirements would reach $1.2 billion a year for Ohio's 1.8
million public school students. Gov. Robert A. Taft had asked the
court to reconsider, given that Ohio is facing billion-dollar budget
deficits.</TE>
<TE>   The state has increased funding for primary and secondary schools
by 81% since 1992, from $3.6 billion to $6.5 billion this year.</TE>
<TE>   Taft did not propose a specific response to the ruling. "I think
everyone is reading into this decision what they would like to hear,
and it is a very, very complicated decision," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Because the court dropped the case, it appears there's no way to
ensure that the Legislature will heed the order, said Richard Salmon,
a professor of education policy at Virginia Tech. "There doesn't seem
to be much muscle," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Justice Thomas J. Moyer said in a dissenting opinion that
the ruling left many unanswered questions for the Legislature and
offered no guidance about how to create a sound funding system.</TE>
<TE>   However, Moyer signed an order Wednesday that said the state must
comply with the previous two rulings to fix the system because it is
unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the coalition of 500 schools that filed the lawsuit
said they expect lawmakers to start creating a new system
immediately.</TE>
<TE>   "They said a thorough and efficient system -- period. Whether the
state has lots of money or little money, whether we have good
economic or poor economic times," said William Phillis, the
coalition's executive director.</TE>

<HD>Bush Forms Independent Panel to Study Postal Service
Reforms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Randy Trick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Wednesday created an independent commission to
examine the U.S. Postal Service's operations and recommend what could
be the first major reforms of the agency since the 1970s.</LD>
<LD>   The executive order creating the commission charges the nine
members "to examine the state of the United States Postal Service,
and to prepare and submit to the President a report articulating a
proposed vision for the future of the United States Postal Service."
The report is due July 31.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's authorization of the new panel came a day after the postal
service announced it had lost $676 million in the fiscal year that
ended Sept. 30.</LD>
<TE>   "The Postal Service has been faced with ongoing financial issues
that will require a very comprehensive look, so that we can make
certain that we have sustainability of postal service to American
people," White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   The postal service in recent years has faced competition from
private delivery services, e-mail and Internet bill paying, shrinking
the number of packages and letters delivered by 4.6 billion during
the last fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials, addressing those concerns, stressed that
the panel was not a first step toward privatizing the postal system.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a stealth project to privatize the Postal Service,"
said Peter Fisher, undersecretary of the Treasury. "We want them to
explore all avenues. Everything else is on the table."</TE>
<TE>   The commission will be working at the same time the Postal Service
is seeking to become financially stable, as outlined in a
transformation plan delivered to Congress in April.</TE>
<TE>   Already underway is a cost-cutting program aimed at trimming $5
billion by 2005. Postmaster General John E. Potter announced in
October that the agency was on track to reach that goal, having cut
$2.9 billion largely by reducing the work force through attrition by
23,000 in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Another 12,000 employees are slated to go in 2003, leading to
another $1 billion in cost reductions by this time next year, Potter
said, which should mean the Postal Service will be $600 million in
the black at the end of this fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   The issues the commission has been told to consider -- flexibility
in prices to respond to financial or market pressures, the efficiency
of current operations and the long-term ability to affordably
maintain universal mail delivery -- are the same factors the Postal
Service has outlined for itself.</TE>
<TE>   The commission "is consistent with -- and complementary to -- the
Postal Service's Transformation Plan," Potter said at Wednesday's
announcement. "The commission is good news coming at the right time."</TE>
<TE>   The creation of the commission was welcomed by the nation's large
mailers, the companies that print and mail catalogs, mass mailings
and other direct-to-consumer materials in-house.</TE>
<TE>   John Campanelli, president of RR Donnelley Logistics, a large
direct mailer whose clients include Lands' End, Sports Illustrated
and TV Guide, said, "We support the independent commission assuming
the commission will work to seek input from interested parties."</TE>
<TE>   For more than six years, large mailers have lobbied Congress
seeking legislation to change the Postal Service's business model in
the hopes of preventing future rate increases, Campanelli said. RR
Donnelly hopes the new presidential commission will make those
changes happen.</TE>
<TE>   "Postal reform is one of those issues that stays eighth on the
priority list," Campanelli said of efforts in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Co-chairing the panel are Harry Pearce, chairman of Hughes
Electronics Corp., and James Johnson, chairman of the Brookings
Institution, a nonpartisan think tank based in Washington, and former
chief executive of the lender Fannie Mae.</TE>
<TE>   The other members are Dionel Aviles, president of Texas-based
Aviles Engineering Corp.; Don Cogman, chairman of CC Investments in
Arizona; Carolyn Gallagher, former president of Texwood Furniture in
Texas; Robert Walker, chairman and chief executive of Wexler Group, a
unit of the public relations firm Hill &amp; Knowlton; Joseph Wright,
president and chief executive of PanAmSat, a Connecticut firm that
makes and operates a fleet of satellites; Richard Levin, president of
Yale University; and Norman Seabrook, president of the New York City
Correction Officers' Benevolent Assn.</TE>

<HD>U.S. to Offer Vaccine for Smallpox</HD>
<DH>The plan is for the military and health-care personnel to
be inoculated first. The public may have to wait until early 2004.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vicki Kemper</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush will make the smallpox vaccination available to all
Americans as a precaution against a possible bioterrorism attack, a
senior administration official said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   In a policy to be announced Friday, Bush will also order the
vaccination of about 500,000 military personnel and set the stage for
the inoculation of another 500,000 front-line health-care workers --
the public health teams that would investigate smallpox cases and the
doctors, nurses and hospital support personnel who would probably be
the first to treat patients.</LD>
<LD>   The general public is not expected to have access to the vaccine
until early 2004, when sufficient doses have been fully licensed by
the Food and Drug Administration.</LD>
<TE>   While news of Bush's long-awaited decision appeared to answer, for
now, the question of who would have access to vaccine, it is also
likely to heighten public awareness of the perceived bioterrorism
threat and could sharpen U.S. allegations against Iraq, which is
believed to possess the deadly virus.</TE>
<TE>   "We are generally concerned about the potential that terrorists or
certain states might have illegal stores of the smallpox virus and
might use it," said the administration official, who requested
anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   "World events play a role in this -- concerns about Iraq, concerns
about other countries," Jerome M. Hauer, acting assistant secretary
of the Health and Human Services Department, said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Iraqis don't comply with the weapons inspectors and the
president decides to be more forceful ... we don't know how desperate
[Iraqi President Saddam Hussein] might be," said Hauer, who has been
among those advising Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney about the
vaccination issue.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to Hussein as "truly a madman," Hauer said: "A cornered
dog becomes vicious. A rabid dog is even more dangerous. That's what
we're dealing with with Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Bush had been weighing the decision for months, carefully
considering intelligence information and scientific data, Hauer said.</TE>
<TE>   The key factor complicating the president's decision was the
danger of the vaccine itself, which contains live viruses.</TE>
<TE>   A study found that at least 52 of every 1 million people
vaccinated will suffer life-threatening side effects, such as severe
skin infections leading to tissue destruction or inflammation of the
brain, and roughly one of those will die.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue is trying to balance the potential use of smallpox as a
biological weapon with the known adverse effects of this vaccine,"
Hauer said.</TE>
<TE>   The unnamed senior administration official said the timing of the
president's decision was directly connected to the resolution of
several key questions.</TE>
<TE>   The White House wanted to make sure, for example, that the
manufacturers of the vaccine and the health workers who administer it
cannot be sued by people who suffer serious side effects or by
relatives of those who die. The bill establishing a Homeland Security
Department provided that indemnity.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the nation's public health agencies are now better
prepared to administer the vaccine. Last week, states submitted to
the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta
their plans for vaccinating as many as 1 million people each within
10 days of a smallpox outbreak. On Monday, they submitted plans that
describe how many health workers at which hospitals would be
vaccinated and thus prepared to administer the vaccine to others.</TE>
<TE>   A final factor prompting the president's decision this week, the
senior administration official said, is that "more vaccine becomes
licensed every day."</TE>
<TE>   The timetable for the three- or four-phase vaccination plan
remained unclear Wednesday, but administration officials have said
that military personnel would be the first to get the vaccine.</TE>
<TE>   Front-line health-care workers are unlikely to begin receiving the
vaccinations until at least Jan. 24, when the liability provision in
the homeland security law takes effect. In addition to shielding
manufacturers of the vaccine and those who administer it from
lawsuits, the provision also establishes a process for filing injury
claims against the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   Sometime after that, the vaccine would likely be offered to all of
the nation's 7 million health-care workers and about 3 million
police, fire and other emergency workers. Only after that would the
public have access to the vaccine.</TE>
<TE>   News of Bush's decision first appeared Wednesday on ABC's "World
News Tonight," which aired excerpts of a Barbara Walters interview
with the president First Lady Laura Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "I will have a detailed [vaccination] plan that the American
people will digest," the president told Walters. "I think it ought to
be a voluntary plan.</TE>
<TE>   "In other words, I don't think people ought to be compelled to
make the decision which they think is best for their family. And
what's going to be very important is for us to make sure that there's
ample information for people to make a wise decision."</TE>
<TE>   Friday's announcement by the president also will kick off a broad
education campaign designed to more fully inform citizens about the
risks of smallpox -- and of the vaccine.</TE>
<TE>   The United States stopped routine vaccinations of children in
1972. The disease, which kills roughly a third of its victims, was
declared eradicated worldwide in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the vaccine's known risks, however, is a changed
population. As many as 30 million Americans -- people with skin
diseases or immune systems compromised by HIV, chemotherapy and organ
transplants -- are at risk for the life-threatening complications of
the vaccine.</TE>
<TE>   Results from a public opinion poll released Wednesday indicate
that roughly six in 10 Americans are worried that smallpox could be
used in a bioterrorism attack and two out of three are willing to be
vaccinated.</TE>
<TE>   But public health officials speaking at a bioterrorism conference
here Wednesday predicted that the number will drop when Americans
learn more about the vaccine's risks.</TE>
<TE>   Hauer estimated that the percentage interested in being vaccinated
will fall from 65% to about 50%. After an "adverse event" -- public
health lingo for a death or serious illness caused by the vaccine --
"people will think twice about" getting the vaccine, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Walters on Wednesday asked Laura Bush whether she would have the
couple's twin daughters vaccinated.</TE>
<TE>   "If the vaccine were available, which I think it will be, I would
feel like that was certainly safe for them to do," the first lady
said.</TE>

<HD>Inquiry of Health Department's Inspector General Is
Expanded</HD>
<DH>GAO's probe includes allegations of a delayed audit of
Florida pension fund, gun possession.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The General Accounting Office has expanded its investigation of
Health and Human Services Inspector General Janet Rehnquist, the
daughter of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, beyond its initial
focus on widespread personnel changes in her office, according to
congressional investigators.</LD>
<LD>   The GAO is now also looking into allegations involving a six-month
delay in an audit of a Florida pension fund that could have benefited
Gov. Jeb Bush, the unauthorized possession of a gun by Rehnquist and
the shredding of documents after the GAO inquiry had begun, the
investigators said.</LD>
<LD>   Ben St. John, a spokesman for Rehnquist, confirmed that these
additional elements have become part of the GAO inquiry. The GAO is
the investigative arm of Congress.</LD>
<TE>   Rehnquist, a former assistant U.S. attorney in Alexandria, Va.,
who worked in the White House under the first President Bush,
supervises a staff of about 1,600. One of the office's main tasks is
to investigate allegations of fraud and waste in the huge Medicare
and Medicaid health insurance programs that are administered by HHS.</TE>
<TE>   The GAO began looking at the operations of Rehnquist's office in
October in response to a request from Sens. Charles E. Grassley
(R-Iowa), Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and John B. Breaux (D-La.). In a
letter to top GAO officials, the three said they were concerned
"about the impact of the loss or reassignment of several senior
managers on OIG operations."</TE>
<TE>   In a separate statement, Grassley said that since Rehnquist was
confirmed in August 2001, there had been 19 senior staff changes in
the office, including the retirement, resignation or reassignment of
six deputy inspectors general, most of whom had at least 30 years'
experience at the agency.</TE>
<TE>   "I want the GAO to determine whether the loss or transfer of these
key people will erode this office's performance," Grassley said at
the time.</TE>
<TE>   The audit of a Florida state government pension fund, scheduled to
begin in April, did not start until September, assuring that any
potentially embarrassing results would not be known until after the
Nov. 5 election in which Jeb Bush, President Bush's brother, won a
second term.</TE>
<TE>   St. John said the audit was delayed at least three times at the
request of Florida officials.</TE>
<TE>   He said the delays were not linked to Florida politics, and that
the outcome of the audit would not have been known until after the
election even if the audit had started in April.</TE>
<TE>   A congressional investigator disputed that, saying that interviews
with people in Florida indicated that the audit "would have been
done" before Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   June Gibbs Brown, Rehnquist's predecessor at HHS who served as
inspector general at four federal agencies, said requests to delay an
audit are unusual.</TE>
<TE>   Late Wednesday, Rehnquist released internal documents on the audit
decision and a letter to Grassley in which she said "my decision to
delay the audit was based on the merits and not motivated by
political reasons."</TE>
<TE>   She confirmed that the delay request came from Kathleen Shanahan,
Bush's chief of staff. Rehnquist said her staff advised her that it
was reasonable.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional investigators said they have also determined that
Rehnquist, who is not licensed to own a gun, had an unloaded handgun
in her office for a short time. St. John said he knew nothing about a
handgun.</TE>
<TE>   Rehnquist herself confirmed the document-shredding allegations in
a letter last week to Grassley and Baucus. She ordered the document
destruction stopped when she learned about it, she said.</TE>
<TE>   St. John said document-shredding was "routine" at the office.</TE>

<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The leadership council of Voice of the Faithful, a Roman Catholic
reform group formed in response to the clerical sexual abuse scandal,
voted late Wednesday to demand the resignation of Cardinal Bernard
Law.</LD>
<LD>   The decision at a parish in suburban Newton came a few hours after
Father Paul Shanley, a pivotal figure in the scandal, walked out of
jail in Cambridge when friends and family posted $300,000 bond.</LD>
<LD>   Voice of the Faithful joined a growing wave seeking the ouster of
the beleaguered cardinal, who has led the nation's fourth-largest
archdiocese for almost 20 years. The vote carried handily, with 71
council members supporting a motion calling for Law's resignation.
Two members opposed the vote and two abstained.</LD>
<TE>   "There is a state of spiritual and moral crisis in the archdiocese
of Boston," Voice of the Faithful President Jim Post said. "In my
judgment, the archdiocese of Boston has effectively been without a
bishop."</TE>
<TE>   Post, a professor at Boston University, termed Law's leadership a
"moral cancer."</TE>
<TE>   Law was in Rome on Wednesday, holding emergency meetings at the
Vatican to deal with the crisis that began in Boston nearly a year
ago, with the trial and conviction of pedophile priest John Geoghan.</TE>
<TE>   Documents released in the Geoghan case showed that top church
leaders knew about sexual abuse complaints against Geoghan, and yet
repeatedly moved him to parishes where he was put in contact with
children. That pattern of protecting priests at the expense of young
parishioners was revealed again and again in more than 10,000 pages
of once-confidential church records made public this year.</TE>
<TE>   Voice of the Faithful, which advocates increased participation by
laypeople in church decision-making, began in a church basement here
in January, weeks after the abuse scandal began. The group's vote
Wednesday came two days after 58 Boston priests signed a letter to
Law calling on him to step down.</TE>
<TE>   The group numbers about 25,000 members nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Shanley, a 71-year-old retired priest, spent seven months behind
bars on 10 counts of child rape and six counts of indecent assault
and battery. He is accused of molesting boys as young as 5 at a
church in Newton over a 10-year period ending in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   As a dozen or so spectators chanted "Pervert!" at him, Shanley
left the high-rise court building that houses the county jail without
commenting. His lawyer, Frank Mondano, whisked his client into a
waiting vehicle that sped away.</TE>
<TE>   Mondano said a "substantial number" of family, friends and
supporters raised the money to free Shanley. Because bond money is
posted in cash, the source is not public record.</TE>
<TE>   The Boston archdiocese said it did not contribute to Shanley's
bail, originally set at $750,000 but reduced to $300,000 by Judge
Charles Grabau.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Shanley was a dashing and prominent figure in Boston
who ministered to marginalized segments of the city's youth and
street populations. He wore jeans, rode a motorcycle and kept his
dark hair long and fashionably styled.</TE>
<TE>   His work garnered favor from church superiors, including Law, who
embraced him at a party to celebrate Shanley's 20th anniversary as a
priest.</TE>
<TE>   But church documents released in the spring showed that
archdiocese leaders knew of sexual abuse complaints against Shanley
dating from at least 1967. Yet for 30 years, church officials
transferred him from parish to parish where he consistently had
access to children.</TE>
<TE>   As early as 1979, Vatican officials were told about statements
Shanley made endorsing sexual relations between men and boys. Shanley
was present at a 1979 conference in Boston that led to the formation
of NAMBLA, the North American Man-Boy Love Assn.</TE>
<TE>   In a sworn deposition this year, Bishop Thomas Daily of Brooklyn,
N.Y. -- formerly a high official in the Boston archdiocese -- said
church leaders knew Shanley advocated sex between men and boys when
they promoted him to lead a parish in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   When Shanley was transferred in 1990 to St. Ann's parish in San
Bernardino, Law sent a letter to the Southern California church
describing Shanley as "a priest in good standing."</TE>
<TE>   By 1995, Shanley was working at a Catholic residential facility in
New York City. A nun there who worried about his contact with minors
called him "a time bomb."</TE>
<TE>   The documents were released this year in a series of civil
lawsuits against Law and the archdiocese. On Wednesday, lawyers here
produced formerly confidential files on 11 priests not previously
mentioned in the sex abuse crisis that has raged in Boston and across
the country since January.</TE>
<TE>   Shanley looked pale and wore a hearing aid in one ear as he left
the courthouse. "Keep him in jail!" yelled Ruth Moore, a member of
Speak Truth to Power -- or STTOP -- a support group for victims of
sexually abusive priests.</TE>
<TE>   The father of one alleged victim said Shanley's release troubled
his 23-year-old son, who said he was raped by Shanley in a church
rectory over a six-year period beginning when he was 5.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a look on his face I haven't seen in years," Rodney Ford
said of his son Greg. "It's back, and it's scary."</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of his release, Shanley is barred from unsupervised
contact with anyone under age 16.</TE>
<TE>   He must remain in Massachusetts and was required to surrender his
passport.</TE>

<HD>Prison for Bomb Plot Supremacist</HD>
<DH>Of mixed race, he was accused of conspiring to blow up
black and Jewish landmarks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>A mixed-race white supremacist was sentenced to almost 22 years in
prison Wednesday for plotting to blow up black and Jewish landmarks
in Boston and Washington.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors accused Leo Felton, 31, and his girlfriend, Erica
Chase, 22, of trying "to ignite a racial holy war ... that would
promote chaos among the races."</LD>
<LD>   Felton, son of a black father and white mother, has said he blames
his parents for "contaminating" him with black blood.</LD>
<TE>   "I've committed crimes here, I'm not trying to say I'm a good
person or a nice guy," Felton said before sentencing. "But not every
thing that has been attributed to me in these cases are
understandable by these simplistic formulas."</TE>
<TE>   Felton and Chase were convicted in July of charges including
conspiring to make a bomb, conspiring to make counterfeit bills and
obstruction of justice. He was sentenced to 21 years and 10 months in
prison. Chase's sentencing is scheduled for Jan. 31.</TE>
<TE>   The couple were arrested in April 2001 when an off-duty police
officer spotted Chase passing a counterfeit $20 bill. Investigators
said Felton was making the phony money to help fund their plan and
had already gathered most of the materials to make a bomb, including
a 50-pound bag of ammonium nitrate, the fertilizer used in the
Oklahoma City bombing.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers maintained they were being prosecuted for their
beliefs and never planned to carry out violent acts.</TE>
<TE>   Felton was a member of the White Order of Thule, and Chase
belonged to the World Church of the Creator. They met after Chase
corresponded with Felton while he was in prison for the attempted
murder of a black taxi driver.</TE>

<HD>Serious Side Effects, Deaths Likely From Vaccine</HD>
<DH>Most people can tolerate smallpox inoculations with only
minor ills. A survey in 1968 found about 1 person per million given
dose died.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Piller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The decision to begin widespread vaccination for smallpox, starting
with 500,000 military personnel and an equal number of
"first-responder" health-care workers, will probably cause a few
hundred serious adverse reactions and perhaps some deaths -- a dark
side of vaccination unseen in the world for 25 years.</LD>
<LD>   Most people tolerate the smallpox vaccine with only minor effects,
such as fever and body aches. But a survey of those inoculated in
1968 found about 1 person per million died of the vaccine's side
effects, and as many as 52 of every million people suffered
life-threatening reactions, including fever, serious infections and
brain swelling.</LD>
<LD>   The side effects are viewed by most public health experts as an
acceptable trade-off against smallpox itself, which kills about 30%
of its victims. And according to a national survey released
Wednesday, most Americans agree. In the poll conducted for the Robert
Wood Johnson Foundation, 65% of respondents said they would take the
smallpox vaccine -- up from 59% polled in May. Only 22% said they
would refuse the vaccine, down from 33% in May. However, pollsters
did not offer details about the vaccine's risks.</LD>
<TE>   For three millenniums before its eradication, smallpox regularly
ravaged nations across the globe, killing millions with high fevers
and an excruciating blanket of erupting pustules across the entire
body, including the palms, eyelids and inside the nostrils. Survivors
were often left with horrific scars as a lifelong reminder.</TE>
<TE>   The last known case of smallpox occurred in Somalia in 1977. After
a global vaccination campaign, the disease -- caused by the variola
virus -- was declared eradicated in 1980. In this country, routine
smallpox vaccination was ended in 1972, meaning that most people who
were inoculated before that time have long since lost their immunity
to the disease and would need to be reinoculated. Today's vaccine is
derived from stockpiles frozen for decades.</TE>
<TE>   Produced From Calves</TE>
<TE>   The smallpox vaccine is made from vaccinia, a virus related to the
variola virus but far less dangerous. The vaccine is mass-produced in
cultures of lymph cells from calves.</TE>
<TE>   Vaccination involves dipping a two-pronged needle into the
vaccine, then using it to make 30 shallow skin punctures on the upper
arm. In most cases this causes a red, itchy bump that eventually
forms a pus-filled blister that heals in about three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The inoculation gives full immunity for three to five years but
gradually wears off over the next decade, according to the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most serious side effects of the vaccine is a skin
infection known as progressive vaccinia. The disease, which kills
tissue around the vaccination site and can spread to other parts of
the body, affects 1 to 2 people per 1 million vaccinations.</TE>
<TE>   A more common but still serious reaction is a similar skin
infection known as eczema vaccinatum. The infection causes a painful
rash across the body and can be fatal. The problem occurs in about 39
cases out of every 1 million vaccinations.</TE>
<TE>   Other Side Effects</TE>
<TE>   Another serious side effect is post-vaccinial encephalitis, an
infection that swells the brain, causing headaches, vomiting, high
fevers and, in rare cases, paralysis and death. It affects about 12
people per 1 million vaccinations.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to these side effects, the 1968 study found that about
935 of every 1 million first-time vaccinations result in serious but
not life-threatening infections -- particularly on the face, eyelids
or genitals.</TE>
<TE>   All of these side effects are less common among people who were
previously vaccinated for smallpox. Virtually no Americans under the
age of 25 -- about 97 million people born after the date of
eradication -- have been vaccinated.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the side effects, including eczema vaccinatum, progressive
vaccinia and the less serious generalized vaccinia, can be treated
with vaccinia immune globulin -- a vaccine derived from the
antibody-rich blood plasma of recently inoculated donors. It must be
injected into muscle tissue. Severe cases can require massive doses
-- as much as a liter injected into multiple muscles for a 220-pound
person. Only 700 doses of vaccinia immune globulin are available,
enough to treat cases expected from no more than 6 million
vaccinations, according to the CDC.</TE>
<TE>   Reserves Sought</TE>
<TE>   Researchers are working to expand that supply within a few months,
using a new vaccinia immune globulin formulation that can be
administered intravenously in much lower doses. The antiviral drug
cidofovir has also shown experimental promise for treating vaccinia
infections, but it would be used only when vaccinia immune globulin
is not available.</TE>
<TE>   Individuals who have ever been diagnosed with eczema or who
currently suffer from immune deficiency diseases, such as AIDS or
certain cancers, including lymphoma and leukemia, should avoid
vaccination. Pregnant women, small children and anyone taking
medications that suppress the immune system also should not be
vaccinated -- and should shun direct contact with anyone healing from
a recent vaccination.</TE>
<TE>   "After someone has received the vaccine, for a period of time they
are suffering from a viral infection," said Steven Block, a Stanford
University biologist and an advisor to the government on biological
warfare defenses.</TE>
<TE>   "At that point, they can give the live virus to someone who is
immune-compromised and who was never given the vaccination at all."</TE>
<TE>   About 500 such incidental infections, often to sensitive parts of
the body, such as the eyes, would probably occur per 1 million
inoculations, the 1968 survey suggests.</TE>
<TE>   However, anyone who has been exposed to smallpox, regardless of
their risk profile, should be vaccinated -- the dangers of the
disease invariably outweigh those of the vaccine. Even a few days
after exposure to smallpox, the vaccine confers a degree of immunity.</TE>
<TE>   In the current vaccination campaign, complications might be more
rare than previous studies showed. The relatively healthy and young
military population is thought to be less susceptible to serious side
effects than the general population. Experts add that careful
screening will help lower the risks as well.</TE>
<TE>   But Margaret Hamburg, a biological warfare expert and former New
York City commissioner for public health, said there is a possibility
that the rate of adverse reactions could be higher than in 1968.
Immune-deficiency ailments are more common now.</TE>
<TE>   Different Than in '68</TE>
<TE>   And unlike today, many of those receiving the vaccine in 1968 had
previously been in contact with family members or others who had
recently been inoculated. Such casual exposure, even when it does not
cause a vaccinia infection, can help the body fight off the vaccine's
side effects, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The absolutely critical thing is that we need to carefully
collect information of the adverse consequences of the vaccination as
we move forward" in order to plan for widespread vaccination
programs, Hamburg said.</TE>
<TE>   After smallpox was eradicated, most stocks were destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   By international agreement, only small quantities for research
were to be retained, and only by the Soviet Union and the U.S. in
highly secure labs.</TE>
<TE>   Revelations that the Soviets, and later the Russians in the
post-Soviet era, manufactured and maintained massive smallpox stocks
in violation of the Biological Weapons Convention came to light in
the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Samples of the virus are thought to have been obtained by Iraq and
other nations suspected of maintaining illegal biological weapon
programs, and may even be in the hands of terrorists -- leading to
the sense of urgency about the current vaccination campaign.</TE>

<HD>Scientists Alarmed by Continued Warming Trend</HD>
<DH>Unprecedented stretch continued this year, the second
warmest on record, suggesting the planet is heating more rapidly than
expected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Usha Lee McFarling</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The year 2002 is the second-warmest in recorded history, according to
NASA scientists who monitor global air temperatures.</LD>
<LD>   A record-breaking stretch of warmth in recent years -- with 2001
now going down as the third-warmest year on record and 1998 still
holding the all-time record -- has scientists and climate experts
concerned that greenhouse gases are warming the planet more quickly
than previously expected.</LD>
<LD>   "Studying these annual temperature data, one gets the unmistakable
feeling that temperature is rising and that the rise is gaining
momentum," said Lester R. Brown, an economist and president of the
Earth Policy Institute in Washington.</LD>
<TE>   The Earth's average temperature during the 2002 meteorological
year was 58.35 degrees Fahrenheit, more than one degree warmer than
the long-term average of 57.2 degrees, said James E. Hansen, a
climate scientist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies who
analyzes surface temperatures collected from several thousand weather
stations around the world.</TE>
<TE>   The meteorological year runs from Dec. 1 to Nov. 30. During that
period, 2001 temperatures averaged 58.12. In 1998, the average global
temperature rose to 58.41 degrees, the highest seen since temperature
records were first compiled in the late 1800s.</TE>
<TE>   The string of warmer years provides strong evidence that humans
are in large part to blame for changing the climate, said Peter
Frumhoff, an ecologist and senior scientist with the Union of
Concerned Scientists in Cambridge, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important we pay attention to this drumbeat of evidence as
the signal of human impact starts to emerge from the noise of natural
climate patterns," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The warm temperatures of 2001 and 2002 are especially significant
when they are considered in the light of El Nino weather patterns
that alter global climate, Hansen said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the heat of 1998 can be attributed to a large El Nino
event that year, which warmed the waters of the Pacific Ocean. But
2001 saw a La Nina event, a spell of cooler conditions, which kept
temperatures that year from soaring even higher. There is a weak El
Nino developing now, but it is not generating nearly as much heat as
the 1998 event.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that 2002 is almost as warm as the unusual warmth of
1998 is confirmation that the underlying global warming trend is
continuing," Hansen said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the warmth of 2002 was seen in Alaska, Siberia and
throughout the Arctic, usually frozen areas that have experienced a
massive loss of ice and thawing of permafrost.</TE>
<TE>   The ice in those regions appears to be responding almost
immediately to the warmer temperatures.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists at the National Snow and Ice Data Center said Arctic
sea ice was at a record low this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the world saw temperatures slightly warmer than average
this year, Hansen said. Temperatures in California and the western
U.S. remained normal.</TE>
<TE>   Many groups oppose curbing greenhouse gases because it would be
costly and harm the coal, oil and automobile industries. They say
estimates of how much warming will occur in the future are uncertain,
flawed and exaggerate the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Richard B. Alley, an expert on abrupt climate change at Penn State
University, said such arguments are wrong.</TE>
<TE>   A new analysis of how the planet's climate has responded to sharp
changes in the past suggests that "either the models are accurate or
they underestimate the changes we will see in the future," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Groups that are concerned about climate change point out that the
rate of warming is steeply increasing. The excess heat could unleash
deadly heat waves, raise the sea level as more ice caps melt, and
cripple agriculture, warned Brown of the Earth Policy Institute.</TE>
<TE>   "Farmers may now be facing higher temperatures than any generation
of farmers since agriculture began 11,000 years ago," said Brown, who

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>Federal prosecutors filed seven charges of murder by arson against a
man Wednesday for a blaze that police say was set in retaliation
against a mother fighting neighborhood drug dealers.</LD>
<LD>   The charges against Darrell Brooks, 21, carry the death penalty,
although prosecutors said they have not decided whether to pursue it.</LD>
<LD>   "If you firebomb a house and you kill seven people -- if that's
not a federal case, what is?" asked U.S. Atty. Thomas DiBiagio.
"Seven people were burned alive in their home."</LD>
<TE>   Angela Dawson and her five children died when fire tore through
their row house Oct. 16. Dawson's husband, Carnell, was burned over
80% of his body and died a week later.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Brooks set the blaze in retaliation for the family's
repeated complaints about area drug dealers.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment charges Brooks with seven counts of arson resulting
in death and other charges related to an earlier fire at the Dawson
home.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Angela, 36, and Carnell Dawson, 43, the fire
claimed the lives of Keith and Kevin Dawson, 9; Carnell Dawson Jr.,
10; Juan Ortiz, 12; and LaWanda Ortiz, 14.</TE>

<HD>New Charge in Colorado Wildfire</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CRIPPLE CREEK, Colo.</DL>
<LD>The former U.S. Forest Service employee who admitted starting the
worst fire in Colorado history was charged with arson Wednesday in
state court.</LD>
<LD>   Terry Lynn Barton pleaded guilty to federal charges last week for
setting fire to forest land and lying to investigators.</LD>
<LD>   The fourth-degree arson charge filed Wednesday against Barton in
Teller County District Court covers damage done to private property
by the 137,000-acre blaze, Dist. Atty. Jeanne Smith said.</LD>
<TE>   The fire, which cost more than $29 million to contain, destroyed
133 houses and one business. The fire also burned in Jefferson, Park
and Douglas counties, and the charge includes damage caused by the
fire in all those counties, Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors from the four counties agreed to file the charge in
Teller County because it suffered $13 million in property damage and
had the largest number of evacuees.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said prosecutors had considered filing the charge in Park
County, where the fire started, or in Douglas County, which also had
high property damage.</TE>
<TE>   First-degree arson, a more serious felony, applies only to people
accused of setting fire to buildings. Second- through fourth-degree
arson are all Class 4 felonies and carry the same possible sentence
of two to 12 years in prison. The difference lies in what was set on
fire and whether fraud was involved.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth-degree charge accuses Barton of starting a fire on
someone else's property, and endangering people and property in the
four counties.</TE>
<TE>   Barton, whose job included spotting illegal fires, told
investigators she accidentally started the June blaze while burning a
letter from her estranged husband in a fire ring in Pikes Peak
National Forest. Authorities believe the fire was intentional.</TE>
<TE>   Campfires were banned at the time because of the drought.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors had considered filing charges against Barton in the
death of a 50-year-old Teller County woman who suffered an asthma
attack after heavy smoke drifted over her house.</TE>
<TE>   No autopsy was performed and Smith said that would make it
difficult to prove a link between the woman's death and the fire.</TE>

<HD>Florida Seeks to Curb Undersea Cables</HD>
<DH>Officials back request from environmentalists, who say
coral is harmed by the fiber-optic gear.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Florida is seeking to tighten restrictions on undersea
telecommunication cables that environmentalists say damage sensitive
coral reefs.</LD>
<LD>   The state Cabinet approved a preliminary request Wednesday from
environmental officials to channel future cables away from corals and
through five designated gaps in reefs.</LD>
<LD>   The swaying motion of the fiber-optic cables has damaged the
coral, which requires hundreds of years to regenerate, according to a
study by Washington-based Public Employees for Environmental
Responsibility.</LD>
<TE>   "Virtually everything the cable touches is harmed in some way,"
said Chuck Sultzman, a Vero Beach marine biologist who led the
research.</TE>
<TE>   Telecommunication officials argued there is no evidence the cables
move along the ocean floor.</TE>
<TE>   The cables are generally owned by a consortium of
telecommunication companies, which says it will challenge the
proposals, including fees for new lines in environmentally sensitive
areas.</TE>
<TE>   "Becoming the only state in the Southeast to charge such fees does
not seem the best way to make or keep Florida as the
telecommunications gateway to Central and South America," wrote Paul
Shorb, a lawyer for AT&amp;T Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly a dozen fiber-optic cables thread through the reefs along
Florida's southeast coast, linking telephone and computer lines in
the state to Latin America, the Caribbean and Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Under the state proposal, new cables would be barred from certain
areas teeming with undersea life and herded through reef gaps in
others. The industry would have to pay a onetime $15,000 application
fee and $5.06 per linear foot to have its cables cross the waters.</TE>
<TE>   The decision from the six elected members of the Cabinet starts
the process that will make rules to implement the proposal. The rules
will be revised after public hearings.</TE>

<HD>Posthumous Baptism of Jews to Stop</HD>
<DH>After earlier accord was apparently breached, Mormons also
again agree to remove names of Holocaust victims and others from
index.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The Mormon church has rededicated itself to end the practice of
posthumously baptizing Jews, an agreement that apparently had been
breached since it was made with Jewish leaders seven years ago,
leaders from both faiths said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   At a meeting Tuesday in New York City, the church reaffirmed its
commitment to removing Holocaust victims and other deceased Jews from
its International Genealogical Index, said Ernest Michel, chairman of
the World Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors.</LD>
<LD>   The index is a list of about 600 million names used by Mormons to
perform ceremonies offering proxy baptisms on behalf of the dead.</LD>
<TE>   Mormon church leaders requested the meeting after several Jewish
organizations complained that the faith had broken the 1995 agreement
to keep deceased Jews -- including those who had died in Nazi
concentration camps during World War II-- from being included in the
temple ceremonies, Michel said.</TE>
<TE>   The Mormon church collects names from records worldwide to use in
temple rituals, during which Mormon stand-ins are dunked in water to
offer the dead voluntary entry into the Mormon religion.</TE>
<TE>   After the 1995 agreement, the church removed about 400,000 names
of dead Jews, mostly Holocaust victims, from the database.</TE>
<TE>   "When the church is made aware of documented concerns, action is
taken in compliance with the agreement," said D. Todd Christofferson,
a church elder.</TE>
<TE>   Independent researcher Helen Radkey, who prepared a report for
Michel that alleged that the church had broken the 1995 agreement,
said that her recent research had found that at least 20,000 Jews had
been posthumously baptized.</TE>
<TE>   Radkey has been researching Jews included in the Mormon lists
since 1999, when she found the famous diarist Anne Frank and her
extended family listed as being baptized.</TE>
<TE>   She said that she is doubtful the church can keep all Jewish names
out of the database.</TE>
<TE>   "It is totally unrealistic," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Most Mormons who handle the processing, including deletions of
Jewish names from the [Mormon] database, would not know a Jewish name
from the back end of a hoe."</TE>

<HD>Eastern States on Ice Again for Second Time in a Week</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The second ice storm in a week knocked out power and snarled air
travel Wednesday in Eastern states.</LD>
<LD>   Freezing rain and slush spread northward from Virginia into New
York state, followed by rising temperatures. The National Weather
Service issued winter weather advisories for the New England states.</LD>
<LD>   "It's terrible. Right now, it's just freezing rain, so all the
streets are icy," said Steve Brundage, a patrol officer in
Binghamton, N.Y.</LD>
<TE>   Dozens of New York schools dismissed classes around midday as the
freezing rain and sleet moved in. Earlier, schools were closed in
parts of Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania. A few
schools also closed in southern parts of Ohio and Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   Ice up to a half-inch thick was reported in parts of western
Maryland during the morning and by afternoon in northwestern New
Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people are staying home," said Cpl. David Paskowski of the
Maryland State Police.</TE>
<TE>   In the Washington area, Delta Air Lines canceled most of its
morning flights at Dulles International Airport, and Atlantic Coast
Airlines, which operates the United Express shuttle, canceled about a
third of its flights before 7:30 a.m., said Airports Authority
spokesman Tom Sullivan.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore-Washington International Airport had numerous delays and
cancellations, said spokeswoman Melanie Miller.</TE>
<TE>   Utilities in Maryland said the ice cut electrical service to more
than 63,000 homes and businesses across the central and western parts
of the state.</TE>
<TE>   About 24,000 customers in northern Virginia and the Shenandoah
Valley had no electricity by midmorning, said David Botkins, a
spokesman for Dominion Virginia Power.</TE>
<TE>   In North Carolina, meanwhile, Duke Power said Wednesday that it
had restored power to 90% of the 1.3 million customers who had lost
power in last week's ice storm. The company said it hoped to have all
customers back on line by late Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina Power &amp; Light, which had a peak of 464,000 customers
without power, had restored power to 98%.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Sen. Mitchell Quits Panel Investigating 9/11</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Citing a reluctance to quit his law firm, former Sen. George J.
Mitchell on Wednesday withdrew from the new commission that will
investigate the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Mitchell was to be vice chairman of the National Commission on
Terrorist Attacks, which former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
is heading. Replacing Mitchell will be former Rep. Lee H. Hamilton
(D-Ind.).</LD>
<LD>   The commission will follow up the work of the congressional
inquiry that issued its final report Wednesday on intelligence
failures leading up to the attacks. The panel will conduct a broader
investigation, looking at issues beyond intelligence, including
aviation security and immigration.</LD>
<TE>   In a letter to congressional Democratic leaders, Mitchell said he
had understood that the commission work would be part time. "However,
as you know, some have urged that I sever all ties to the law firm
with which I am associated. Since I must work to support my family, I
cannot comply," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   He said concerns were raised about potential conflicts of
interests and whether he would devote the time necessary to the
commission. Some politicians and commentators have raised similar
questions about Kissinger, who heads a major consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton served more than 30 years in the House and was a former
chairman of the International Relations and Intelligence committees.</TE>

<HD>Doctor Gets Probation for Taking Body Parts Home</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GAINESVILLE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>A neurologist who kept hundreds of body parts in his home pleaded no
contest to storing or maintaining human remains without a license and
was given a year of probation.</LD>
<LD>   As part of his plea bargain, Dr. Joseph Warner, 49, cannot take
home human specimens used in his research.</LD>
<LD>   Warner, 49, accepted the terms Tuesday and left the courthouse
without answering reporters' questions.</LD>
<TE>   His attorney, Chief Assistant Public Defender Johnny Kearns, said
Warner, who is now with a Jacksonville medical group, is continuing
his research and does consulting work. He recently wrote a book about
neuroanatomy.</TE>
<TE>   "Dr. Warner seems to have been portrayed somewhat as a ghoul,"
Kearns said. "The materials were at his house for legitimate research
purposes."</TE>
<TE>   Warner was arrested in August after police responded to a domestic
battery complaint at his Gainesville home and found preserved heads,
brains, arms and other body parts at his house, some stored in
plastic Tupperware containers.</TE>
<TE>   Warner used his home as a lab, Kearns said. It was more convenient
for him to work there because of his back problems and limited
mobility.</TE>
<TE>   State Atty. Bill Cervone said all of the specimens, most from the
University of Florida, have been returned. Before his arrest, Warner
had held a courtesy appointment as an assistant professor at the
University of Florida College of Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   "He did not have authorization to take any human anatomical human
specimens out of his laboratory to his home," said university Health
Science Center spokeswoman Arlene Phillips-Han.</TE>
<TE>   A domestic battery charge against Warner for allegedly attacking
his estranged wife was dropped, as was a grand theft charge.</TE>

<HD>4 Pennsylvania Miners Testify in Grand Jury Probe of
Accident</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HARRISBURG, Pa.</DL>
<LD>Four of the nine miners who became trapped in an underground flood
after they breached an abandoned mine were questioned Wednesday by a
state grand jury investigating whether the accident involved criminal
wrongdoing.</LD>
<LD>   Neither the state attorney general's office, which convened the
jury, nor a lawyer for the miners would comment on the miners'
testimony.</LD>
<LD>   But attorney Howard Messer, who represents seven of the nine
miners, said after the hearing he was encouraged that the state would
conduct a thorough investigation of the July 24 accident at Quecreek
Mine in western Pennsylvania.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecuting attorneys asked each of the miners to recall what
happened before, during and after the breach that flooded the mine,
trapping the men for 77 hours, Messer said. A preliminary report by
state and federal agencies had blamed the accident on inaccurate
maps, which led the miners to mistakenly believe they were still some
300 feet away from the abandoned mine.</TE>

<HD>Thomas Assails Cross Burning as Terror Tactic</HD>
<DH>The Supreme Court justice, normally silent during oral
arguments, says such action doesn't deserve free speech protection.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who sits silently during most
arguments, spoke up Wednesday to condemn cross burning as the "symbol
of a reign of terror" that does not deserve the 1st Amendment's
protection for free expression.</LD>
<LD>   For nearly 100 years, the Ku Klux Klan used cross burning and
lynchings to terrorize blacks and Jews throughout the South, he said.</LD>
<LD>   A burning cross is "unlike any symbol in our society.... There was
no communication of a particular message. It was intended to cause
fear and to terrorize the population," said Thomas, the only black
justice.</LD>
<TE>   His comments came midway through the oral argument in a Virginia
cross-burning case and seemed to turn the tide against the
free-speech claim.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years ago, the high court unanimously struck down a St. Paul,
Minn., ordinance banning cross burning, ruling that this form of
symbolic expression, like flag burning, is protected by the 1st
Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors in Virginia, California and half a dozen other
states continue to enforce laws against burning crosses, saying they
are punishing threats and intimidation, not speech. Similar laws also
forbid the display of a Nazi swastika; those measures also depend on
the outcome in the Virginia case.</TE>
<TE>   "Cross burning is a tool of intimidation. The message is a threat
of bodily harm," Virginia Solicitor Gen. William H. Hurd told the
justices.</TE>
<TE>   He was defending two prosecutions in 1998, one involving a Klan
rally and the other involving a small cross burned outside the home
of a black family in Virginia Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Klansman Barry Black led a cross-burning rally in a farm field.
The 30-foot cross, blazing near a state highway, could be seen by
passing motorists.</TE>
<TE>   Black was arrested and fined $2,500. In the Virginia Beach case,
two men were also fined $2,500 and given 90 days in jail.</TE>
<TE>   But when they appealed, the state Supreme Court overturned the
convictions and struck down the cross-burning law last year. "Under
our system of government, people have a right to use symbols to
communicate," even if their message is one of contempt for America or
an "expression of bigotry," the judges said.</TE>
<TE>   Professor Rodney Smolla, a 1st Amendment expert at the University
of Richmond law school, defended the state court ruling and urged the
justices to uphold the principle that even obnoxious and loathsome
expressions are protected by the 1st Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   It is "at the core of our 1st Amendment tradition" that the
government cannot "single out a symbol" for criminal punishment just
because of the message it conveys," Smolla said.</TE>
<TE>   Why isn't "brandishing a cross like brandishing a gun"? asked
Justice Antonin Scalia. It is illegal to brandish a gun.</TE>
<TE>   Because the gun itself is dangerous, Smolla replied. The cross is
not a danger in itself. It's the message that is seen as dangerous,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we were here in 1820, I might agree with you," commented
Justice David H. Souter. But the history of cross burning in America
has given this act a particular power, he said, referring to Thomas'
comments.</TE>
<TE>   "Why can't the state regulate this as a particularly virulent form
of intimidation?" added Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.</TE>
<TE>   Cross burning originated in the Scottish Highlands as a means of
sending signals from one clan to another. Though the Ku Klux Klan
formed after the Civil War, the first reported cross burning in
America took place at Stone Mountain, Ga., in 1915. It could be seen
as far away as Atlanta, and the act was attributed to the mob that
had recently taken Jewish merchant Leo Frank from his jail cell and
lynched him.</TE>
<TE>   Cross burning soon became a central feature of Klan rallies.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration lawyers, siding with Virginia, urged the court
to rule that cross burning is conduct "intended to threaten or
intimidate, not a regulation of speech."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben said cross burning "is
akin to a threat ... a signal to violence."</TE>
<TE>   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy questioned this notion, because the
court has usually said threats can be made illegal only if they are
direct and immediate.</TE>
<TE>   "So any time a cross is burned near a highway, it's a crime?" he
asked.</TE>
<TE>   But Thomas then intervened to say that cross burning is unique
because of its history. "Aren't you understating the effects of the
burning cross?" he asked Dreeben.</TE>
<TE>   Though Thomas often writes forceful opinions or dissents, he
rarely speaks up during oral arguments. Months go by before he asks a
question or takes issue with a lawyer's argument.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas has told friends that the oral arguments are mostly a
public show. He says the justices decide the cases based on the
written briefs and by analyzing the lower court opinions.</TE>
<TE>   However, visitors to the high court routinely comment on the odd
spectacle of eight justices peppering a lawyer with questions while
Thomas silently sits. Sometimes, he looks bored. Other times, he and
Justice Stephen G. Breyer spend part of the argument trading joking
comments.</TE>
<TE>   But Thomas, who grew up in the segregated South, has clearly taken
a strong interest in cases involving race, whether it is affirmative
action, busing for desegregation or the historically black colleges.
Those cases have prompted many of his strongest written opinions.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, when the court took up a case involving the Klan and
cross burning, Thomas spoke up and upbraided his colleagues for
discussing it as a purely free-speech issue.</TE>
<TE>   "The Klan has appropriated one of the most sacred of religious
symbols as a symbol of hate," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   In other areas, Thomas is one of the court's most consistent
advocates of a broad 1st Amendment, but spreading terror goes beyond
free speech, he suggested Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   A ruling in the case of Virginia vs. Black, 01-1107, is expected
in several months.</TE>

<HD>Church Intern Reportedly Admits to Killing Priest</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>A recently fired Franciscan brother trainee told detectives he shot
the Roman Catholic parish priest who supervised his work, then set a
fire to the rectory to conceal the slaying, police said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Father William Gulas was shot in the chest while he sat at his
desk in his church office Saturday. He had been pastor for nine years
at the historic St. Stanislaus Church in the city's Slavic Village
neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   The detective's report, filed with the court, said church worker
Daniel Montgomery admitted he shot the priest and set the fire. He
then called the Fire Department, the report said.</LD>
<TE>   Police said Montgomery, 37, also provided a written statement
admitting to the crime that was not released. He pleaded not guilty
Tuesday to murder and arson charges.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Henry Hilow did not return a call Wednesday
seeking comment on the police report.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery was told Nov. 28 that he would be fired from his
internship effective Wednesday. One reason reportedly was his use of
foul language at the church's elementary school.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery's mother, Janice, who spoke to him by telephone the day
after the fire, said he seemed mentally ill.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery had consoled parishioners outside the rectory after the
fire and helped distribute communion at Mass on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "I embraced him during this horrible weekend, along with about
half of the congregation," said Yolanda Kane, 72, a parishioner who
taught for 30 years at the St. Stanislaus school.</TE>
<TE>   "I was totally unaware that he was responsible for this. It's just
like having a traitor in your midst," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Gulas, a native of Hazleton, Pa., was ordained in 1961 and came to
St. Stanislaus in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery is jailed without bond, and a preliminary hearing was
set for Jan. 14.</TE>

<HD>Bloomberg Retreats on Smoking Ban in N.Y.</HD>
<DH>Instead of outright prohibition, it'll be OK to light up at
cigar bars, outdoor cafes, private clubs and places with special
ventilation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Getlin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg reached agreement with City
Council leaders Wednesday on a compromise measure that would ban
smoking in nearly all bars and restaurants.</LD>
<LD>   The mayor won the council's support only after scaling back his
original proposal, which called for a total smoking ban in such
facilities. Under the new version, smoking would be permitted in
cigar bars, outdoor cafes, private clubs like American Legion halls,
nursing homes, and in bars and restaurants that create specially
ventilated smoking rooms where employees do not enter.</LD>
<LD>   Bloomberg said the ban -- which the council is expected to pass
next week -- would protect employees and others in public places from
the effects of secondhand smoke. He told a City Hall news conference
that "because of this legislation, it's literally true that something
like 1,000 people will not die each year that would have otherwise
died from secondhand smoking."</LD>
<TE>   "I think that restrictions on smoking in the workplace, which
includes bars and restaurants, is an idea whose time has come," he
added.</TE>
<TE>   California and Delaware and some cities ban smoking in all
restaurants and bars; the proposed New York City measure is part of a
national trend in which municipalities are considering similar bills,
according to anti-smoking activists. On Wednesday, for example,
Boston's Public Health Commission approved a measure to prohibit
smoking in establishments that serve food and drink. Local officials
in Chicago and Cleveland are also considering such measures.</TE>
<TE>   New York's current law prohibits smoking in restaurants that seat
more than 35 customers, but it excludes free-standing bars and
restaurants with separate areas for bars. Bloomberg's proposal, which
many smokers and bar owners have bitterly opposed, would affect an
estimated 13,000 establishments. Opponents have said the bill would
deprive them of the right to smoke and dine in public, and would also
put a damper on tourism.</TE>
<TE>   "No one should have to choose between their health and their job,"
said City Council Speaker Gifford Miller, who supported Bloomberg's
drive to safeguard employees' health, but had objected to the
original bill's more sweeping provisions. "The purpose here is not to
punish smokers, but to protect employees."</TE>

<HD>George Gaffney, 62; Pianist Accompanied Top Singers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>George Gaffney, a pianist who made a living accompanying some of the
leading names in American song, including Carmen McRae, Peggy Lee,
Engelbert Humperdink and, most notably, Sarah Vaughan, has died. He
was 62.</LD>
<LD>   Gaffney died Dec. 4 in Los Angeles of complications from a severe
stroke he suffered in September, friends reported. While hospitalized
for surgery related to the stroke, he suffered a second stroke and
never regained consciousness.</LD>
<LD>   A native of New York City, Gaffney began studying the piano at age
10 but switched to the trombone. After serving in the U.S. Marine
Corps from 1958 to 1961, Gaffney returned to New York City, picked up
the piano again and began arranging and backing singers.</LD>
<TE>   In the mid-'60s, Gaffney moved to the Chicago area, where was he
was musical director of the Playboy Club in Lake Geneva, Wis. It was
there that he first met Vaughan, with whom he would reconnect much
later.</TE>
<TE>   Gaffney came to California in the early 1970s and found work as a
studio musician and accompanist. He worked on a number of television
programs, most notably the Bruce Willis-Cybill Shepherd series
"Moonlighting," and was nominated for an Emmy. From 1980 to 1990, he
was Vaughan's accompanist and musical director.</TE>
<TE>   "She could fill a house without a microphone. You'd feel [her
voice] in the wood and in the floor," Gaffney told the Ottawa Citizen
some years ago.</TE>
<TE>   He moved to Las Vegas in 1994 and worked for a time as
Humperdink's musical director. In recent years, he also orchestrated
tunes for Rita Moreno.</TE>
<TE>   Gaffney is survived by three children and five grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>To Huu, 82; Revolutionary Poet, Former Official in
Vietnamese Government</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To Huu, Vietnam's best-known Communist revolutionary poet and a
former Politburo member, has died. He was 82.</LD>
<LD>   Huu died Monday at Military Hospital 108 in Hanoi after a long
illness, a family member said Wednesday. His funeral is planned for
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   He is to be buried at the elite Mai Dich Cemetery, reserved for
senior Communist Party officials.</LD>
<TE>   Huu was born in October 1920 in the imperial capital of Hue as
Nguyen Kim Thanh and began writing poetry at age 6. He became active
in politics and joined the Communist Party in 1938.</TE>
<TE>   At age 19 he was imprisoned by the French, but he escaped three
years later.</TE>
<TE>   Fighting alongside Ho Chi Minh, Huu publicly proclaimed, "I am
both a revolutionary and a poet. For me, poems are a weapon for the
revolution," the Thanh Nien (Youth) newspaper reported.</TE>
<TE>   One of his most famous poems, "Since Then," described his
awakening to communism as the moment when the "sun of truth shone on
my heart." His works continue to be taught in schools throughout his
homeland.</TE>
<TE>   In postwar Vietnam, Huu held a number of senior government posts.
He joined the elite Politburo in 1976 and was appointed deputy prime
minister in 1980 but was ousted from the government in 1986 for
mishandling the economy.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by two daughters and one son.</TE>

<HD>David Weiss, 93; Wrote Historical Novels Based on Lives of
Artists</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Weiss, 93, a historical novelist who embellished on the lives
of such artists as Rodin, Mozart and Rembrandt, died Nov. 29 at a La
Jolla hospital. The cause was thrombophlebitis and complications from
a fall.</LD>
<LD>   Weiss wrote 12 books, including "Naked Came I," a 1963
best-selling novel based on the life of sculptor Auguste Rodin.</LD>
<LD>   The author published his first novel rather late in life: He was
over 40 when "The Guilt Maker" came out in 1953. His debut was
recognized with the Frieder Literary Award for best novel on a Jewish
theme published in America.</LD>
<TE>   A 1933 graduate of Temple University who later studied at the New
School for Social Research in New York, he worked at more than 50
jobs -- including stevedore, actor, welfare worker, store clerk and
swimming instructor -- before turning to writing.</TE>
<TE>   In one of his longest-held jobs, he was a story editor for
producer David O. Selznick for seven years. Weiss worked on the films
"A Farewell to Arms" and "Tender Is the Night."</TE>
<TE>   Orphaned by age 4, he was raised in Philadelphia by an aunt who
owned a Russian restaurant frequented by famous composers who visited
the Academy of Music, a historic opera house and concert hall, across
the street.</TE>
<TE>   Mozart would become one of his favorite subjects. He wrote two
books on the composer: "The Assassination of Mozart" and "Sacred and
Profane."</TE>
<TE>   Other figures who inspired his fiction included dancer Isadora
Duncan, architect Christopher Wren and painter Titian.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Mary Hamilton Wesley, 67, a civil rights activist whose insistence
that she be addressed with the same respect given whites became an
issue before the U.S. Supreme Court, died Nov. 11 near Ossining, N.Y.
She had battled ovarian cancer for several years.</LD>
<LD>   In the 1960s, Wesley joined the Freedom Riders, a group that
tested the South's resistance to a 1960 Supreme Court ban on
segregation at bus and train stations.</LD>
<LD>   A light-skinned black who refused to pass for white, Wesley was
arrested on charges of disturbing the police after a bus ride through
Alabama in 1963. During the court hearing, an attorney insisted on
calling her Mary, instead of Miss Hamilton. She said she would refuse
to answer his question "until I am addressed correctly."</LD>
<TE>   The judge found her in contempt and sentenced her to five days in
jail and a $50 fine.</TE>
<TE>   Her conviction was upheld by the Alabama Supreme Court, but
reversed in 1964 by the U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Wesley was a native of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. She was educated at
Briarcliff College and Manhattanville College, both in New York, and
became an English teacher who taught for many years in the Los
Angeles area.</TE>

<LD>William Gleysteen, 76, a career Foreign Service officer who was
ambassador to South Korea during a turbulent period beginning in the
late 1970s, died Friday in Washington, D.C., of leukemia.</LD>
<LD>   Gleysteen was ambassador from 1978 to 1981, a period marked by the
assassination of President Park Chung Hee in 1979, the imposition of
martial law, and violent confrontations between the military and
anti-government demonstrators.</LD>
<LD>   He wrote about these events in his book "Massive Entanglement,
Marginal Influence: Carter and Korea in Crisis," which won an award
in 2000 from the American Academy of Diplomacy.</LD>
<TE>   Gleysteen retired from the Foreign Service in 1981 and became
director of the Asia Society's Washington Center. Later he was
director of studies at the Council on Foreign Relations and president
of the Japan Society.</TE>
<TE>   Gleysteen, the son of Presbyterian missionary-educators, was born
in Beijing and was interned by the Japanese with his family in 1943.
When he was released, he joined the Navy and served until the end of
World War II. Fluent in Mandarin, he studied international relations
at Yale University before joining the Foreign Service in 1951.</TE>

<HD>Arvell Shaw, 79; Bassist With Key Figures in Jazz</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Arvell Shaw, a bassist who played with several of the leading figures
in jazz but was best known for his 25-year association with Louis
Armstrong, has died. He was 79.</LD>
<LD>   Shaw died Dec. 5 of an apparent heart attack at his home in New
York City.</LD>
<LD>   Born in St. Louis, he began playing tuba and trombone in high
school and learned double bass on Mississippi riverboats while
playing with pianist Fate Marable.</LD>
<TE>   Shaw was in Navy bands during World War II. After his discharge,
he returned to St. Louis and was working in local bars and clubs.
When Armstrong's bassist left the trumpeter's orchestra during a stop
in the Missouri city, the local musicians union suggested Shaw as a
replacement.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw played in the orchestra from 1945 until Armstrong disbanded
it in 1947.</TE>
<TE>   When Armstrong formed a septet, which included such legendary
players as Jack Teagarden and Earl Hines, he included Shaw as the
bassist.</TE>
<TE>   Until Armstrong's death in 1971, Shaw had a fairly steady role
with the jazz great. He can be heard on much of Armstrong's recorded
work during that period.</TE>
<TE>   For years after Armstrong's death, Shaw recounted that playing
with him was pure joy.</TE>
<TE>   "Some nights I'd be standing next to Louie as he played, and he'd
give me goose pimples, because the man had so much power, so much
emotion that sometimes it would bring tears to your eyes, and you try
to fight the tears back and you just couldn't," Shaw told Newsday
last year.</TE>

<HD>Paul Vathis, 77; Associated Press Photographer Won Pulitzer
Prize</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul Vathis, whose 56 years as an Associated Press photographer
included a Pulitzer Prize for his pensive picture of then-President
Kennedy and former President Eisenhower walking together at Camp
David after the Bay of Pigs invasion, died Tuesday. He was 77.</LD>
<LD>   Vathis died in his sleep at his Mechanicsburg, Pa., home.</LD>
<LD>   From the AP bureau in Harrisburg, Pa., where he spent most of his
career, Vathis built a national reputation for his skill with a lens,
his instinct for news and his boundless energy.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to his prize-winning shot of Kennedy and Eisenhower,
Vathis provided the only newspaper photos of Wilt Chamberlain's
history-making 100-point NBA basketball game in 1962. He had gone to
the game as a spectator, taking his son as a 10th birthday present.</TE>
<TE>   Vathis photographed the 1987 news conference suicide of
then-Pennsylvania Treasurer R. Budd Dwyer after he was convicted of
taking a bribe. In 1979, he covered the Three Mile Island nuclear
power accident.</TE>
<TE>   One of eight children of Greek immigrant parents, Vathis was born
in the northeastern Pennsylvania town of Mauch Chunk, since renamed
Jim Thorpe.</TE>
<TE>   A World War II Marine combat veteran, his introduction to
photography consisted of sitting in the rear gunner's seat of a dive
bomber and shooting pictures of bomb damage on caves where Japanese
soldiers were hiding.</TE>
<TE>   Vathis began his AP career in Philadelphia in 1946 and also worked
in the Pittsburgh bureau before moving to Harrisburg in 1952.</TE>
<TE>   He was scolded by Kennedy's press secretary for shooting his
Pulitzer-winning picture on that April day in 1961 after the
president's handlers had declared the photo opportunity over. The
picture shows Kennedy and Eisenhower absorbed in conversation, their
backs to the camera, as they walk on a path.</TE>
<TE>   Vathis is survived by his wife, Barbara, their son and two
daughters, six grandchildren and one great-grandchild.</TE>

<HD>Fay Gillis Wells, 94; Pioneering Female Pilot and Longtime
Journalist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mary Rourke</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fay Gillis Wells, one of the first female pilots in the world and a
journalist who covered the White House during four presidents' terms,
died Dec. 2 of complications from pneumonia. She was 94 and had been
hospitalized for six days in Falls Church, Va.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Minneapolis, she was one of three children. Her father was
a mining engineer whose career led his family to a life of travel and
adventure. From childhood, Gillis and her family lived in countries
rarely visited by Americans at the time, including the Soviet Union.</LD>
<LD>   Gillis entered Michigan State Farming University in 1927, the year
Charles Lindbergh completed his first solo flight across the
Atlantic. Two years later she dropped out of school and earned her
pilot's license. Lindbergh's flight and the glamorous fame of
socialite pilot Amelia Earhart had captured Gillis' imagination. She
moved to New York City and took a job demonstrating and selling
planes for Curtiss-Wright Aircraft. There, she met Earhart.</LD>
<TE>   In 1929, Gillis co-founded an aviators club for women and helped
persuade Earhart to be the first president. It was called the
Ninety-Nines, after the number of charter members. At the time there
were 177 female pilots in the country. The club now has about 7,000
members.</TE>
<TE>   Gillis had her first brush with disaster three weeks after she
earned her flying license. She was taking a stunt piloting lesson
when the plane her instructor was piloting began to disintegrate
above Long Island. She parachuted to safety; he had to be
hospitalized.</TE>
<TE>   The incident set a course for Gillis' future. She was invited to
join the all-male Caterpillars Club, notching up the status of women
among the ranks of skilled pilots. To qualify for membership a person
had to have experienced a life-threatening parachute jump from a
plane. Beyond that, Gillis' future husband, Linton Wells, set his
sights on her after seeing a news article about her accident.</TE>
<TE>   "My father saw a picture of my mother hanging from a tree and
said, 'That's the girl for me,' " Linton Wells II of Springfield, Va.
told The Times this week. Wells is named after his journalist father,
a foreign correspondent and aviator, who died in 1977.</TE>
<TE>   Between her first parachute jump in 1929 and her marriage to
Linton Wells in 1935, Gillis spend four years in Moscow with her
father, who was building zinc plants for the Soviets. She began her
career as a journalist in the Soviet Union, writing freelance
articles for the New York Herald Tribune and several aviation
magazines.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of a honeymoon, the Wellses went to Ethiopia in 1935 to
cover the Italian invasion for the Herald. Her choice of Africa
required her to turn down an offer from Wiley Post, a record-setting
pilot, to accompany him on one leg of his second global flight.
Humorist Will Rogers accepted Post's offer, and both men died when
their plane crashed in Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   Wells later described the coincidence as sheer luck.</TE>
<TE>   In Africa the couple befriended the director of the Cairo Zoo, and
she adopted a pet leopard and cheetah that she brought to Hollywood
in 1936, when she covered the movie industry for the Herald Tribune.</TE>
<TE>   By 1941 the Wellses had returned to Africa as correspondents for
the Herald.</TE>
<TE>   When their son was born in 1946, the Wellses had settled in
Florida. "My mother took 17 years off to raise me," Linton Wells II
said. The family lived on a houseboat, and young Linton rode a
motorboat to school.</TE>
<TE>   In 1963 the Wellses moved to Washington, D.C., when their son
entered the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis. They worked for Storer
Broadcasting Corp., an independent radio and television network.
Linton was bureau chief, Fay covered the White House. During the next
13 years she reported on Presidents Johnson, Nixon, Ford and Carter.
She was one of three female reporters to accompany Nixon to China in
1972.</TE>
<TE>   After her husband died in 1977, Wells kept up her contacts with
female pilots although she had given up piloting in 1960. "Planes got
too technological for me," she told the Kansas City Star in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   She also traveled from home in Arlington, Va., to promote the
International Forest of Friendship, a tree-planting project to honor
the memory of aviation pioneers. Wells helped establish the project,
a park-like setting in Atchison, Kan., near the house where Earhart
was born.</TE>
<TE>   She was often invited to speak to elementary school children. "She
loved children," her son said of her. "She'd talk about the early
days of flying. To the girls in the class, she'd say there is no
limit to what you can do."</TE>
<TE>   Along with her son, Wells is survived by one brother and two
grandsons. Her sister died in 1993. Her ashes will be scattered over
the Pacific Ocean, as were her husband's.</TE>
<TE>   Donations in her memory can be made to the Amelia Earhart
Scholarship Fund, c/o Charlene Falkenberg, 618 S. Washington St.,
Hobart, IN 46342. Or the International Forest of Friendship, P.O. Box
99 AE, Atchison, KS 66002. Contributions should be designated for the
Fay Gillis Wells memorial.</TE>

<HD>Seeking New Traffic Study, L.A. May Sue Over Ahmanson Ranch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council authorized its attorneys Wednesday to
prepare a lawsuit challenging the Ahmanson Ranch housing development
in Ventura County on the grounds that its traffic study is
inadequate.</LD>
<LD>   A final vote on whether to proceed with the lawsuit was scheduled
for Jan. 7, which gives the Ventura County Board of Supervisors time
to act on the environmental study for the 3,050-home project proposed
near Calabasas.</LD>
<LD>   Councilman Dennis Zine, who represents much of the west San
Fernando Valley, said the $2-billion development will add to traffic
congestion on the Ventura Freeway and West Valley streets.</LD>
<TE>   "This particular project is going to be disastrous," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he hopes the council action will serve as a warning to
Ventura County officials that Los Angeles is serious in wanting
additional environmental study of the development. A representative
for Mayor James K. Hahn also said that the mayor supports taking
legal action if Ventura County refuses to listen to the city's
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   City transportation officials have concluded that a 1992
environmental study of the project's effect on traffic is outdated
and does not sufficiently address the changed conditions in the area
as other development has clogged the freeways.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Deputy City Atty. Keith Pritzker said Ventura County
officials have indicated they do not intend to conduct a new traffic
study, "which our experts and the county transportation experts feel
is necessary to adequately protect the interests of our residents."</TE>
<TE>   Several residents also told the council Wednesday that traces of
the toxic chemical perchlorate found in a well near the development
site require additional analysis and testing.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Weston, an attorney for developer Washington Mutual, told
the council that the project is "environmentally sensitive" and was
praised by many people when it was first approved 10 years ago
because it included the donation of 10,000 acres for preservation of
open space.</TE>
<TE>   "Ahmanson Ranch has been subjected to the most comprehensive
environmental studies of any project in the history of California,"
he said, blaming Ventura Freeway congestion on West Valley
development approved by Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney said opponents of the project have lost suit after
suit. "We don't need more litigation," he said. "What we need is a
regional housing solution."</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce also
voiced support for Ahmanson Ranch, urging the council to help develop
a better regional transportation system rather than spend money on
another court battle.</TE>

<HD>Shake-Up at Coastal Commission</HD>
<DH>Chairwoman says Davis wanted her out, though she'll remain
on the board. Panel deadlocks on a successor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth R. Weiss</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- Environmental activist Sara Wan stepped down as
chairwoman of the California Coastal Commission on Wednesday, saying
it was clear to her that Gov. Gray Davis and Assembly Speaker Herb
Wesson wanted her replaced as leader of the panel that wields
enormous power over oceanfront development.</LD>
<LD>   But the 12-member panel, torn by philosophical differences and
personal animosities, deadlocked on votes to pick a successor, with
six commissioners voting in favor of one of Wan's most outspoken
critics and six for one of her supporters. The matter will be taken
up again in January.</LD>
<LD>   During her three years as chairwoman, Wan led a majority of
commissioners who embarrassed the governor in his relationship with
the president of Mexico by opposing a salt-mining operation, proposed
by the Mexican government, in a Baja lagoon where gray whales nurse
their young. She also angered Davis by forcing developers to scale
back building plans in the Bolsa Chica wetlands in Orange County.</LD>
<TE>   Wan stirred the wrath of oceanfront homeowners -- particularly in
her hometown of Malibu -- by championing public access to the beach
and tightening restrictions on where houses can be built in wildlife
habitat.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesmen for the governor and the speaker denied any attempts to
pressure Wan to quit.</TE>
<TE>   Wan's decision not to seek a fourth yearlong term as chairwoman
capped weeks of lobbying and politicking over the leadership of the
commission, which functions like a planning board by approving and
denying construction projects along California's 1,150-mile
coastline.</TE>
<TE>   "I have managed to accomplish things that may make some people
angry, but also may help to protect and preserve this place for
future generations," Wan told supporters who packed a commission
meeting at the Hyatt Regency Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Although she will remain on the board, Wan said it was time to
pull out of a "very political, very divisive and very personal"
chairmanship fight when she learned the governor's office and
Assembly speaker were lobbying her fellow commissioners to pick
someone else.</TE>
<TE>   That candidate, Commissioner Dave Potter, said Wan was
exaggerating the political influence coming from Sacramento. "I don't
think anybody got their arm broken," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Potter, who also is a Monterey County supervisor, agreed that the
election fight had become too personal, including what he called
unfair attacks on his concrete-paving business, his voting record on
environmental issues, and minor conflicts that required him to return
campaign donations to developers.</TE>
<TE>   "She's an extreme environmentalist," Potter said of Wan. "I'm just
an environmentalist," adding that commissioners seemed to get along
better when some of them were Republicans, rather than all Democrats,
like the current panel. "This is Democrats eating their own."</TE>
<TE>   The fight over the chairmanship reflects tensions in Sacramento
among California's Democratic leaders, including Davis, Wesson and
state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton. Each appoints four of the
12 commissioners.</TE>
<TE>   It's a division of power that was designed to make political
meddling more difficult as the panel determines the fate of coastal
developments proposed by people with easy access to the governor and
the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Controversial Projects</TE>
<TE>   In the next few years, the commission will have to deal with
politically charged projects, including one to build more housing in
the Ballona wetlands in West Los Angeles and the final size of a
housing development next to the Bolsa Chica wetlands. Upcoming
projects also will include a new Pebble Beach golf course being
pushed by Clint Eastwood, and Donald Trump's proposal to upgrade and
privatize a cliff-side golf course on the Palos Verdes Peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   Patricia Soto, a spokeswoman for Wesson, said "the speaker did not
have a hand in Wan's decision to withdraw from the race." Soto said
it was only natural for Potter, a Wesson appointee, to become
chairman because he is in line for the job as vice chairman and for
Wesson's other appointees to support him.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, denied that Davis
had a direct hand in the matter. "The governor didn't make a single
call to his appointees," he said. "If there was a massive conspiracy
to dump her, the governor would have made those calls and the votes
of his appointees would have been four to nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Davis' appointees split their votes. Two of them --
Cynthia McClain-Hill and Gregg Hart -- supported Potter. Two others
-- Christina Desser and John Woolley -- broke ranks and voted for
Mike Reilly, who was presented at the last moment as an alternative
to Wan. Reilly had the backing of the Sierra Club and other
environmental activists who jammed the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Desser commended Wan for a "very noble and responsible act" of
stepping aside to end the fractious debate that has hamstrung the
commission in recent months. She called on Commissioner Potter to
withdraw his name from consideration as chairman.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Shirley Dettloff, a Huntington Beach councilwoman,
also threw her support behind Reilly, who is a Sonoma County
supervisor. She called Reilly "the right person to heal the wounds of
the past several months and lead the commission."</TE>
<TE>   But Reilly could not initially muster the votes to end the fracas,
forcing the dissension to fester for another month. The decision was
deadlocked between him and Potter.</TE>
<TE>   Late in the day, Wesson's appointees sought to hold another vote.
Soto said they were prepared to support Reilly. But McClain-Hill, who
has been leading the crusade to oust Wan and who backs Potter,
objected to going ahead with the vote. Unanimous consent was needed
to bring up the matter again.</TE>
<TE>   Potter declined to step aside for the sake of harmony, saying he
had become entrenched in his position because the "extremists had
mounted a personal attack on me, especially that I'm not a good
environmentalist and other insults and untruths."</TE>
<TE>   Accusation</TE>
<TE>   He accused Mark Massara, manager of the Sierra Club's coastal
programs, of mischaracterizing his environmental positions in a
widely circulated e-mailed newsletter called Coastwatch. Earlier this
year, Massara helped lead a campaign of activists urging Wesson not
to reappoint Potter to the commission.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Sierra Club's report card on key votes, Potter
scored only a 20% last year. Wan, by comparison, voted the
environmentally correct way 66% of the time. The Coastal Commission
casts hundreds of votes every year on various projects, from massive
developments to the construction or remodeling of single-family homes
perched along the coastline.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, under Wan's leadership, the Coastal Commission approved
82% of the 649 projects that came to a vote. That compares to an 88%
approval rate of coastal projects during the last year of the
previous chairman, Rusty Areias.</TE>
<TE>   "Sara Wan, unfortunately, is the recipient of a political beating
for her outspoken advocacy of coastal protection," Massara said. "It
shows how politicians in Sacramento don't appreciate the overwhelming
public support for preserving the coast."</TE>
<TE>   Massara pointed out that Wan is a member of an environmental group
-- Vote the Coast -- that withheld support for Davis' reelection in
November.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Nichols, California's resources director and a Davis
appointee, said she thought it was a politically naive move on the
part of Wan's group.</TE>
<TE>   "Politicians do pay attention to who endorses them and who
doesn't," Nichols said.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Whooping Cough Cases Up Sharply</HD>
<DH>In 2002, four have died here and in L.A. County. The
puzzling trend is occurring nationwide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Gottlieb</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whooping cough, a once-dreaded childhood disease that became a rarity
a generation ago, is up sharply across Southern California,
particularly in Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   Health officials counted 96 cases of the disease -- including two
deaths -- through Nov. 29 in Orange County, compared to 15 cases in
the same period last year. The figure is higher than any annual total
recorded since 1958, when there were 133 cases.</LD>
<LD>   Similar patterns, though less dramatic, are seen elsewhere in the
region. Los Angeles County, with about 120 cases and two deaths, is
running about 20% above last year's figure.</LD>
<TE>   The trend is part of a general rise that has been underway for
years and far exceeds population growth. Nationally, the number of
cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control has grown more than
seven-fold over the last 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the increase is seen in babies who have not completed
their vaccinations, said A. Nelson El Amin, medical director of the
Los Angeles County Immunization Program.</TE>
<TE>   But the reason for the increase remains a puzzle.</TE>
<TE>   "No one really knows the answer why there's this long-term trend
of gradual increase, even though immunization coverage has gotten
higher," said Dr. Loring Dales, medical officer in the Immunization
Branch of the California Department of Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   Whooping cough was a major cause of death among infants before the
vaccine was introduced in the mid-1940s.</TE>
<TE>   The disease, also called pertussis, is caused by a bacteria that
is spread when a sick person coughs. The disease is characterized by
fits of coughing so severe that the victim may turn blue around the
mouth as a result of lack of oxygen.</TE>
<TE>   The disease gets its name from the high-pitched "whoop" the sick
person makes when trying to suck in air while coughing.</TE>
<TE>   Whooping cough can kill by cutting off the oxygen supply or by
leading to secondary infections such as pneumonia. The bacteria also
produce toxins that can kill. The disease is treated with
antibiotics.</TE>
<TE>   Children receive whooping cough immunizations as part of the DPT
or DTaP series, along with diphtheria and tetanus vaccines. The
series of five vaccinations are recommended at 2, 4 and 6 months,
between 12 and 18 months, and between 4 and 6 years. The complete
series is required in California before a child enters kindergarten.</TE>
<TE>   When the series is completed, the vaccine is about 85% effective.
Unlike the measles vaccine, the pertussis series wears off after
several years. When introduced, the vaccine dramatically reduced the
number of cases of whooping cough, which peaked at 21,344 in
California in 1941, killing 112. The number of cases dropped to 75 in
1976.</TE>
<TE>   The disease runs in cycles, spiking higher for three to four years
and then falling. But beneath that has been the general trend of an
increasing number of cases. The peak in recent years was 1,140 in
1999.</TE>
<TE>   According to the CDC, the number of whooping cough cases among
children 6 months to 4 years old has remained stable, meaning the
vaccine still works. Babies who catch the disease before their
vaccinations are complete are infected by adults who may not realize
they have whooping cough.</TE>

<HD>Ventura Nurse Dies After Being Struck by Motorcycle</HD>
<DH>Her injuries had appeared minor, but massive internal and
head trauma was later found. The accident is under investigation.</DH>

<LD>A Ventura nurse and foster mother struck by a motorcyclist while
crossing a street on her way to work has died, authorities said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Although police initially believed her injuries in the Tuesday
accident were minor, Cindy Marie Rohrback, 42, suffered massive
internal and head injuries that were discovered during surgery at
Ventura County Medical Center in Ventura.</LD>
<LD>   "She was a wonderful, amazing woman," said her sister, Cathy
Bozek, a Ventura attorney.</LD>
<TE>   Rohrback was walking back to Buenaventura Medical Clinic on Brent
Street, where she had worked for a month, about noon Tuesday when she
was hit by a motorcyclist while trying to cross Main Street.</TE>
<TE>   "I ride motorcycles and have seen some bad crashes," said Don
Woolard, a Ventura resident who witnessed the crash, "and this one
was pretty bad."</TE>
<TE>   The impact threw Rohrback several feet in the air, and the rider
of the Harley-Davidson was thrown from his seat, Ventura Police Sgt.
John Turner said.</TE>
<TE>   The motorcyclist, Dustin Peck, 30, of Ventura, was treated for a
concussion and cuts and scrapes at a local hospital and released. He
has not been cited, but police were investigating whether speed was a
factor.</TE>
<TE>   Woolard said he was sitting in his truck at a red light on Main
when he saw the motorcyclist pass a large delivery truck on the right
and then accelerate.</TE>
<TE>   "He went around a big FedEx delivery truck and then just took
off," Woolard said. "Next thing I saw was his bike flying in the
air."</TE>
<TE>   Rohrback was pronounced dead shortly before 7 p.m. Tuesday, said
Armando Chavez, a senior deputy county coroner.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to her new job, Rohrback also had worked as a nurse
since 1999 at Hitchcock Urgent Care Center in Santa Barbara, a
facility of Sansum-Santa Barbara Medical Foundation Clinic.</TE>
<TE>   "The staff is devastated," said Paul Jaconette, Sansum's chief
administrative officer. "Cindy was well-loved by her co-workers."</TE>
<TE>   Rohrback, an Oxnard native, spent more than five years in night
school before graduating from the Ventura College nursing program,
said her sister. In addition to raising two sons, Rohrback served as
a foster parent, her family said.</TE>
<TE>   "She worked very hard," Bozek said, "and was just in the wrong
place at the wrong time."</TE>
<TE>   A service has been scheduled for Saturday at Avenue Community
Church on Ventura Avenue. The time is pending. Charles Carroll
Funeral Home in Ventura was handling the arrangements.</TE>

<HD>Riverside County Sees Hitch in 91 Tollway Deal</HD>
<DH>If OCTA doesn't drop the ban on freeway improvements,
officials say, they might not abandon a lawsuit that could block the
sale.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Weikel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Riverside County officials say they might withhold critical support
for the sale of a controversial tollway to the Orange County
Transportation Authority unless the agency removes a provision in the
deal similar to one that has blocked improvements to the heavily
congested Riverside Freeway for years.</LD>
<LD>   Documents being prepared for the purchase of the 91 Express Lanes
echo a non-compete agreement between Caltrans and California Private
Transportation Co., owner of the toll lanes running along 10 miles of
the Riverside Freeway west of the county line. Protests over that
agreement fueled the sale in the first place.</LD>
<LD>   The provision is designed to protect the owner's revenue by
barring the state from widening the heavily congested freeway for 30
miles, including the stretch of toll lanes. OCTA plans to continue
collecting tolls until it has paid off debt taken on to buy the
lanes.</LD>
<TE>   Riverside County officials said the non-compete wording must be
stripped from the sale agreements or neutralized before they will
drop their lawsuit against Caltrans and the tollway owner. The case
challenges the legality of the existing non-compete agreement and
must be dismissed before the deal can proceed.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA has repeatedly promised that the authority's purchase of the
Express Lanes will end the highly controversial non-compete agreement
and clear the way for Orange and Riverside counties to make $1.6
billion in improvements. The $207-million deal is set to close Jan.
2.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA officials Wednesday described the new problem as a minor
hitch that can be easily solved. No matter what, they pointed out,
non-compete clauses are banned by recent state legislation that
granted OCTA the power to charge tolls.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in complete agreement that all non-compete provisions be
eliminated," said OCTA General Counsel Ken Smart. "It is a matter of
interpretation, and we will work it out. I don't believe we have an
issue."</TE>
<TE>   Smart said the provisions in question contain very general wording
that prevents Caltrans from interfering with OCTA's ability to
collect toll revenue and retire the tollway's debt. The wording was
included to assure lenders, OCTA officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside County officials said they are concerned that
non-compete language remains in several documents related to the
sale, including drafts of a franchise agreement, terms of a 1999
Caltrans court settlement and documents related to the assumption of
ownership by OCTA.</TE>
<TE>   "From our point of view, the non-compete language must be stricken
from the deal," said Riverside County Supervisor Bob Buster, who also
sits on the Riverside County Transportation Commission. "If it
remains, you could get a whole other world of obstacles."</TE>
<TE>   The current restrictions, which would expire in 2030 if the sale
does not take place, have been a source of political tension between
Orange County, which originally supported the tollway, and Riverside
County, whose motorists pay one of the highest tolls in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Haley, executive director of the Riverside County
Transportation Commission, said that all of the fine print is of
concern but that both sides will work to clear up the language.</TE>
<TE>   "We have come a long way and have resolved a lot of differences of
opinion," Haley said. "It would be folly to allow minor issues to
create friction. All the big stuff has been done."</TE>

<HD>City May Delay Permit Fee Hikes; Sewer Bureau Appeals for
Funds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy and Tina Daunt</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Struggling to balance the budget without raising the ire of
residents, Los Angeles city officials Wednesday proposed delaying fee
increases for police business permits even as other officials
announced they are seeking a series of rate raises for sewer
services.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, City Hall is trying to defuse a controversy that
erupted this month after officials sent letters to 151,000 businesses
and independent contractors ordering them to pay back taxes or face
penalties.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles officials are pursuing fee increases and the
collection of all the business taxes the city is owed, in part to
deal with growing budget problems. But with the economy still shaky,
taxpayers are not letting their city government get by with boosting
fees without letting them hear about it.</LD>
<TE>   "Whenever the economy is sluggish, people tend to be a little more
nervous about how they spend their money and how their government
spends their money," said Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis
Taxpayers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   That concern has been conveyed in hundreds of phone calls and
letters in recent weeks from businesses and individuals. Some have
called to say they had no idea that the work they did from home,
whether freelance writing or baby-sitting, constituted a small
business. Many pleaded for exemptions and waivers from back taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Others have protested planned fee hikes on 14 police-issued
permits, including 1,000% or more for firearms vendors, pawnbrokers
and towing operators. A pawnbroker permit, for example, is due to
rise from $24 to $2,000.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, City Council members Cindy Miscikowski and Dennis
Zine introduced a motion to extend the deadline for paying police
permit fees from Dec. 31 to March 31 and use that time to reevaluate
whether the fee hikes are justified.</TE>
<TE>   Also during Wednesday's council meeting, Councilwoman Wendy Greuel
called on her colleagues to waive all penalties and interest charges
on back taxes owed by individuals and businesses who gross less than
$100,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   "Now more than ever, the city needs to take all necessary steps to
protect its businesses and families from excessive tax burdens,"
Greuel wrote in a motion distributed to the council.</TE>
<TE>   The council is set to vote Friday on the motions.</TE>
<TE>   Later Wednesday, the City Council heard from the city Sanitation
Bureau that the cost of rebuilding the city's sewer system to meet
state and federal mandates may require an increase of 3% per year for
four years in the sewer service charge. Bureau manager Lisa Mowery
told a council panel that her office has submitted a proposal to the
mayor to enact the first 3% fee increase next year.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not had an increase since 1992," Mowery said.</TE>
<TE>   The bureau went into debt to finance a $1.6-billion revamping of
the Hyperion Waste Treatment Plant, and is currently spending $600
million to replace sewer lines throughout the city.</TE>
<TE>   The sewer service charge is about $240 per year for the
average-sized house, Mowery said. A 3% fee increase would add 60
cents to the average monthly bill, officials estimated.</TE>

<HD>LAUSD Plan to Close Skills Gap Ordered</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Erika Hayasaki</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education
unanimously approved a resolution this week requiring Supt. Roy Romer
to create a plan within six months to close the academic achievement
gap separating African American and Latino students from their Asian
and white peers.</LD>
<LD>   "If you measure it with standardized tests, more African American
and Latino students are failing reading and math," board member Jose
Huizar said. "Even if you look at graduation rates and students
entering college, there's a huge gap."</LD>
<LD>   On the most recent Stanford 9 basic skills exam, African Americans
and Latinos scored in the 34th percentile overall, compared with the
67th percentile for whites and the 70th for Asians, according to the
district.</LD>
<TE>   The resolution, which was sponsored by Huizar and fellow board
members Genethia Hudley-Hayes and David Tokofsky, requires Romer to
show how current curriculum, instruction and staff development
programs will close the learning gap.</TE>
<TE>   The districtwide reading and math programs for elementary
students, which have been praised for boosting test scores, and the
recently established middle and high school literacy plan will also
be reviewed, Huizar said.</TE>
<TE>   "We just have a random set of programs that may or may not be
serving those kids who need it most," Huizar said.</TE>
<TE>   The schools that rank lowest on the state's Academic Performance
Index are predominantly African American or Latino and are located in
some of the highest poverty areas in Los Angeles, Huizar said.</TE>
<TE>   African Americans and Latinos make up 84% of the district's
student population.</TE>
<TE>   "You find more non-credentialed teachers in schools with
predominantly African American and Latino students. They lack
additional counselors," Huizar said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are [fewer] magnet schools in low-income areas and [fewer]
AP courses offered," Huizar said.</TE>

<HD>Builder to Abide by Burial Ground Edict</HD>
<DH>Developer had balked at coastal panel order on handling of
Native American remains in Seal Beach. A plan will be filed within a
week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Haldane</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The builder of a major housing project in Seal Beach has agreed to
comply with a California Coastal Commission order to preserve Native
American remains found at the site.</LD>
<LD>   John Laing Homes will submit, within a week, a plan for handling
the 22 sets of remains unearthed since July, a spokesman for the
developer said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm very optimistic that we can work something out," said Steve
Kabel, regional president of John Laing Homes, which plans to build
70 houses on 17 acres of the old Hellman Ranch off Seal Beach
Boulevard.</LD>
<TE>   The project was effectively put on hold this week by a unanimous
vote of the state commission, which ruled that the area where the
human remains were found constitutes a Native American cemetery and
thus is a cultural resource requiring mitigation by the developer.</TE>
<TE>   The company had argued that the remains were isolated and
therefore less than culturally significant.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, however, Kabel said the developer was ready to
comply with the commission's order and would submit a plan offering
several alternatives, including removing and reinterring the remains
off site, leaving them undisturbed or moving them to a designated
area within the project.</TE>
<TE>   "We are giving serious consideration to setting aside a portion of
the development for reburial," Kabel said. "It's really up to the
parties involved to sit down and come up with a balanced, reasonable
mitigation acceptable to everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Work was halted on the project in September after Native American
monitors representing the Gabrielino-Tongva tribe protested the
unearthing of the remains.</TE>
<TE>   The state's Native American Heritage Commission has designated
members of that tribe as the most likely descendants of those buried
at the site.</TE>
<TE>   "We would very much like to find a solution that both [the
developer] and the Native Americans can live with," said Lisa Haage,
the coastal commission's chief of enforcement. "We would like to
broker an agreement that makes sense."</TE>

<HD>High-Speed Rail Proposed to Link L.A., Ontario</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kurt Streeter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After nearly two years of deliberations, regional transportation
officials have settled on a route linking West Los Angeles and
Ontario International Airport for the first leg of a proposed
high-speed railway, and formally asked Congress this week for money
to begin planning.</LD>
<LD>   The 45-mile first segment of the maglev train system, so called
because it would be powered by a largely untested magnetic levitation
system, would cost at least $5 billion, generate top speeds of nearly
250 miles per hour and potentially whisk passengers end-to-end in
about 30 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   Officials at the Southern California Assn. of Governments tout the
proposed first segment as the foundation of what could become a
nearly 300-mile network of high-speed, magnetically powered trains
crisscrossing the region. Planners envision the day when maglev links
the Ontario airport to Los Angeles International Airport, and
possibly to other airports and communities throughout Southern
California.</LD>
<TE>   But under the proposal, the first line, which would run down the
middle of Interstate 10 and open in about 10 years, would fail to go
all the way to LAX. The leg would stop instead near the I-10 and San
Diego Freeway interchange, though officials hope to extend it to the
airport later.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal ends months of struggle at SCAG, which has pursued
plans for the system despite fading interest from the federal
government and criticism of the proposed line as an ineffective
boondoggle.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal was encouraged by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.),
who has expressed interest in a high-speed project but insisted that
local officials agree on a route before she pushes for more money in
the Senate. The SCAG board spent months hashing out 32 proposed
routes for the railway.</TE>
<TE>   A line from West Los Angeles to Ontario was finally judged to be
the most cost-effective, winning out over proposals to build the
first leg between Los Angeles and Orange County or Palmdale. Mark
Pisano, executive director of SCAG, said the initial leg fits the
goal of increasing usage of regional airports other than LAX. Pisano
said building the maglev line could help boost the number of
passengers using the Ontario airport from less than 10 million to 30
million yearly.</TE>
<TE>   SCAG is seeking $60 million from Congress for planning and
environmental studies. The agency expects that it also would need
about $30 million from local public sources for planning. Money to
build and operate the system, the balance of the projected $5-billion
cost, would be sought from the private sector.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a vital first step, a real move in the right direction,"
said Robin Lowe, a Hemet city councilwoman on the SCAG board. Lowe
said the railway would help alleviate freeway gridlock.</TE>
<TE>   "The speed is the big advantage over anything else," she said.
"People are going to flock to this thing."</TE>
<TE>   Many transit experts question the practicality of maglev, however,
citing concerns about earthquake safety and the viability of maglev
technology that is almost totally untested. No maglev railways exist
in the United States, and existing lines in Japan, China and Germany
are relatively new.</TE>
<TE>   Another issue is that the maglev railway would be incompatible
with the state's plan to build a high-speed rail network potentially
connecting Sacramento, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego.
Trains on the state's proposed $25-billion railway, which would not
use maglev but technology akin to that on the French high-speed rail
system, would never be able to connect with SCAG's regional system.</TE>
<TE>   SCAG has kept at its plans despite a lack of firm backing from
Washington. The SCAG maglev plan failed to make a final cut in 2001
when the federal government promised nearly $1 billion to Pittsburgh
and Baltimore instead.</TE>

<HD>Thousand Oaks Council Chooses Fox as Mayor</HD>
<DH>Slow-growth majority, rather than elevate one of its own,
backs eight-year member who was leading vote-getter in last month's
election.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregory W. Griggs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a gesture of cooperation, the Thousand Oaks City Council's new
slow-growth majority has chosen Councilman Andy Fox as mayor instead
of one of its own.</LD>
<LD>   Incoming council members Bob Wilson Sr. and Claudia Bill-de la
Pena, both part of a slate of candidates backed by outgoing Mayor Ed
Masry in November, joined Masry and Councilman Dennis Gillette in
backing Fox.</LD>
<LD>   "Just in terms of fairness, it was my turn as mayor," Fox said.</LD>
<TE>   He said he isn't making too much of the one-year appointment.
"I've conducted myself in a civil and professional way for eight
years and expect all the members will do the same."</TE>
<TE>   Fox, a firefighter who received the most votes in last month's
council election, was sworn in for a third four-year term in a
special reorganization meeting Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   Gillette, a retired assistant sheriff, was sworn in for a second
term. And newcomers Wilson, who runs the Cisco's restaurant chain,
and television producer Bill-de la Pena, began their first terms.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson was chosen mayor pro tem, Fox's previous post. If council
tradition holds, Wilson, who is finishing the unexpired council term
of incoming county Supervisor Linda Parks, would be in line to serve
as mayor in 2004, when he would be up for reelection.</TE>
<TE>   "Overdevelopment lessens our quality of life and though it is a
lucrative business, money alone cannot be the basis for land-use
decisions," Wilson said. "Money does not talk; people do. And I am
here to listen."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson said the new council should demonstrate over the next two
years "how much can be done to institute true slow growth" through
preservation of open space and ridgelines, effective traffic
management and neighborhood enhancements. It should also provide "an
even playing field where the voices of residents and small business
are heard as loudly as big developers."</TE>
<TE>   Bill-de la Pena said the election of a slow-growth council
majority does not signal an end to business opportunities in Thousand
Oaks. "It is my intent to continue the strong relationship the city
has enjoyed with not only small businesses, but big ones as well,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Bill-de la Pena, chairwoman of the city's Planning Commission
before her election, said developers must recognize that "the health,
welfare and safety of our residents come above their bottom line."</TE>
<TE>   She declared exceptions to city rules sometimes granted in the
past to be "an endangered species."</TE>
<TE>   Bill-de la Pena said the council was beginning an era of
restrictive growth and suggested that top city administrators follow
a new path.</TE>
<TE>   "I expect to have the full support from the city manager and city
attorney's office," she said, to pursue a proposal suggested by one
of her unsuccessful running mates.</TE>
<TE>   Former Planning Commissioner Michael Farris, one of four
candidates on the slow-growth slate, wants the city to acquire an
8.7-acre parcel of land south of Potrero Road in Newbury Park as
permanent open space, rather than permit development of three estate
homes. Farris lost a lawsuit he filed against the city seeking to
prevent construction at the site.</TE>
<TE>   Bill-de la Pena said she plans to ask the council at Tuesday's
meeting to authorize the start of negotiations with the landowner,
Operating Engineers Pension Trust.</TE>
<TE>   The city earlier worked out a deal with Operating Engineers to
allow construction of the expensive homes in exchange for it
providing $2.5 million to help pay for a public equestrian center at
nearby Rancho Potrero. The city is circulating a preliminary
environmental review on that project at the former Broome Ranch.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council also authorized sending Wilson and Bill-de la
Pena to the Ventura County Board of Supervisors meeting Tuesday to
oppose development of Ahmanson Ranch east of Thousand Oaks, until
additional traffic and environmental studies are done.</TE>

<HD>Newsman Tapped for LAPD Post in Security</HD>
<DH>Chief Bratton asks his former N.Y. spokesman to help L.A.
develop a counter-terrorism plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andrew Blankstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chief William J. Bratton has asked John Miller, co-host of the
"20/20" newsmagazine on ABC, to join the Los Angeles Police
Department as his special assistant, with responsibilities that would
include homeland security.</LD>
<LD>   Miller, 44, would advise Bratton on issues involving
counter-terrorism as part of an expanded homeland security bureau
being considered by the department, Bratton said in a telephone
interview from Israel, where he delivered a speech and met with
police officials.</LD>
<LD>   "I am very interested in hiring John Miller to the position of
special assistant to the chief," Bratton said.</LD>
<TE>   Miller, who co-wrote a book on the government response to security
challenges after Sept. 11 last year, said he is interested.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very exciting possibility and we are still talking," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   ABC executives had said that Miller was considering leaving to
become a press aide to Bratton. Bratton said Wednesday that Miller
would not handle press relations.</TE>
<TE>   The exact duties of the position have not been established.
Bratton has proposed three new positions of assistant to the chief,
which have yet to be created by the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   No decision has been made on whether Miller would serve in an
advisory or supervisory position.</TE>
<TE>   If the position is created and Miller accepts it, he would report
directly to Bratton, said a source familiar with the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Should he accept the job, Miller would take a substantial pay cut
as he did in 1993, when he left ABC to work for Bratton, then head of
the New York City Police Department. As Bratton's top press advisor
for two years, Miller took a $500,000 cut in annual salary.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles officials appear to endorse Bratton's efforts to bring
change to his department.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Middlebrook, deputy mayor for policy and communications, said
Mayor James K. Hahn was strongly inclined to support personnel
decisions by the chief that would help reduce crime .</TE>
<TE>   "The mayor set very clear goals for Chief Bratton and that is that
he wants to reduce crime and improve public safety in the city of Los
Angeles," Middlebrook said. "If this [appointment] helps him achieve
the goals that the mayor laid out, we're all for it."</TE>
<TE>   Questions May Surface</TE>
<TE>   David Dotson, a former assistant LAPD chief, said he sees nothing
wrong with bringing in outsiders to manage aspects of the department.
He added, however, that there may be valid questions should Miller be
placed in charge of homeland security or anti-terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing magic about having a sworn person in management
at the department, and I welcome Bratton's courage to bring in an
outside person," Dotson said. "But the question remains, is Miller
qualified?"</TE>
<TE>   Bratton said Miller has extensive qualifications, describing him
as an intimate confidant and advisor of more than 10 years "who
understands how I operate."</TE>
<TE>   Miller, who interviewed Osama bin Laden and co-wrote a
best-selling book on terrorism, has extensive knowledge of the
subject as well as a wealth of sources, Bratton said.</TE>
<TE>   Miller's job dealing with the press at the NYPD was "the least of
his skills," according to Bratton, who said that Miller played a key
advisory role in the department's overall reorganization and the
formulation of overall crime strategies attacking guns, drugs and
youth violence in the city.</TE>
<TE>   Miller has conducted media training at the NYPD academy and the
FBI's National Executive Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles' readiness to fight terror was questioned earlier this
year in a 50-page report by Councilman Jack Weiss. The report called
for the recruitment of a national counter-terrorism expert, in
addition to a new city director of homeland security.</TE>
<TE>   Expansion Urged</TE>
<TE>   The report also called for doubling the LAPD's anti-terrorism
division by adding 30 officers dedicated to full-time surveillance
and to providing added analytical and intelligence capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Department officials said the homeland security bureau would get a
much higher profile under the new chief, but that the details of the
office, how much it would grow by and which units would report to it,
were still being discussed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's critical to consolidate and expand our counter-terrorism and
intelligence capabilities," Weiss said. "Chief Bratton's
responsiveness to this issue is a breath of fresh air in a city that
still has a long way to go to be prepared."</TE>
<TE>   Known for his stylish ways, Miller rose to prominence as a
reporter at New York's NBC affiliate, interviewing the likes of
organized crime chieftain John Gotti.</TE>
<TE>   Miller is perhaps best known for his May 1998 interview with Bin
Laden, which occurred two months before the U.S. embassy bombings in
Kenya and Tanzania. Miller is an Emmy winner who has spent five years
at ABC.</TE>
<TE>   He and two other veteran reporters have a best-selling book on
terrorism: "The Cell Inside the 9/11 Plot and Why the FBI and CIA
Failed to Stop It."</TE>
<TE>   The book recounts Miller's face-to-face meeting with Bin Laden and
examines how the intelligence community was not able to stop 9/11.</TE>

<HD>Feds Say Irvine Teacher Has Taken Child-Porn Plea Deal</HD>
<DH>The charge that will be filed stems from material allegedly
found on his school computer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.G. Reza</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An English teacher at University High School in Irvine has agreed to
plead guilty to possession of child pornography that investigators
found on a computer in his classroom, a federal prosecutor said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Kenneth D. Fair Jr. will enter the plea when he is arraigned Jan.
6 by a U.S. magistrate, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Richard Y. Lee.</LD>
<LD>   Fair, 32, was one of several people investigated as part of
Operation Candyman, a federal probe launched in 2001 of a ring that
exchanged child pornography throughout the United States.</LD>
<TE>   A search warrant affidavit filed by FBI Agent Christina Lewis said
Fair's identity was discovered in March 2001 by an undercover Houston
FBI agent who had infiltrated the ring. While the investigation of
Fair was underway, school officials discovered the child pornography
in his classroom computer independently and contacted the FBI, Lee
said.</TE>
<TE>   Court records show that school officials continued to find
pornographic files on Fair's classroom computer until October 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the children shown in the files were as young as 4,
according to court records. Fair has been on administrative leave.</TE>
<TE>   Under the terms of the plea agreement, Fair will plead guilty to
one count of possession of child pornography and be sentenced to a
maximum of five years in prison, Lee said.</TE>

<HD>26% of Kids Overweight, Study Finds</HD>
<DH>Nearly 40% are not physically fit, according to test of 1.2
million schoolchildren. L.A. County areas rank among state's worst.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Ornstein and Erika Hayasaki</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than one-quarter of California children are overweight and
nearly 40% are not physically fit -- and the problem is most
pronounced in Los Angeles County, according to a comprehensive study
of fifth-, seventh- and ninth-graders to be released today.</LD>
<LD>   The review of physical fitness and body composition tests for 1.2
million children in public schools is by far the largest ever
undertaken in California, and the first to compare various regions.
It shows that L.A. County is home to eight of the nine state Assembly
districts with the worst findings.</LD>
<LD>   "When I saw this data, I was shocked ... we were all shocked,
because we had no idea of this concentration" in Los Angeles County,
said Harold Goldstein, executive director of the California Center
for Public Health Advocacy, a nonpartisan organization that conducted
the review based on state data. "Clearly, an emphasis needs to be
placed on promoting healthy eating and physical activity in the L.A.
Basin."</LD>
<TE>   The rate of overweight youths in California -- 26.5% -- exceeds
the national figure of about 15% for 6- to 19-year-olds, although the
numbers are not directly comparable. The state's definition of
overweight -- based on a formula including height, weight, gender and
age -- is broader and would therefore include more children.</TE>
<TE>   Public health experts say overweight and unfit children face a
greater risk of developing health problems, including heart disease,
diabetes, asthma and cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost all of [the results are] pretty appalling," said Dr.
Francine Kaufman, a USC professor and president of the American
Diabetes Assn., but she called the L.A. County numbers particularly
striking.</TE>
<TE>   Most people "figure that we're out in the sun all day long,
running around," Kaufman said. In reality, though, "there are unsafe
neighborhoods. The parks are not kept up. Nobody in their right mind
would let their kids go there."</TE>
<TE>   Another probable factor is Los Angeles' high concentration of
minority residents. Other studies have shown that the prevalence of
overweight children is much higher among blacks and Latinos, compared
with whites and Asians, because of an interplay of genetic, economic
and cultural forces.</TE>
<TE>   While the California study did not pinpoint specific reasons for
children's weight and fitness problems, the Assembly districts in
L.A. County with the highest proportion of overweight children in the
state also had the highest concentrations of minorities.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, independent experts familiar with the study's findings
cited the availability of junk food on school campuses and schools'
noncompliance with state physical education mandates.</TE>
<TE>   Mark LaPlant, a physical education teacher at Thomas Edison Middle
School in South-Central Los Angeles, has classes of 55 students and
minimal resources. A recreation room the size of two classrooms has
been converted into a tiny gym, but its ceilings are not high enough
to play volleyball. Most P.E. classes take place outside on a
blacktop.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the emphasis here at this school is literacy," he said.
"They would rather put all of the funds toward math, science and
English because that's what counts."</TE>
<TE>   Osahon Ekhator, 11, a student at Charles Drew Middle School in
South-Central Los Angeles, said many children are left unsupervised
during P.E. class because there are too many students for teachers to
watch. Some, like him, play basketball. Others, he said, listen to
headphones under a tree, do homework or eat.</TE>
<TE>   "They sneak food," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A 160-pound 11-year-old who attends Edison Middle School said she
would like to stay after school to participate in sports, but she's
not allowed to because her parents think it's dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a lot of shooting around here," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Also, when she plays with other children, she runs the risk of
being teased. "They might call me fatso," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Parents and children say schools bear some responsibility for
fostering overweight students, but youngsters also are making some
poor choices -- at school and at home. Also, fast food is often
cheaper than a more nutritious meal.</TE>
<TE>   Sydni Mahler, 11, a student at Drew Middle School, said pupils
flock to the campus store to buy slushies, nachos, candy and chips.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother, Tawnya, frowned when she heard the choices. "What
about watermelon and cantaloupe?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   Sydni, who was munching on a bag of Flamin' Hot Cheetos, replied
with a shrug: "If they replaced all the junk food with healthy food
and fruit, that would be nasty."</TE>
<TE>   With a $722,925, two-year grant from the nonpartisan Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation, the California Center for Public Health Advocacy
analyzed data collected by the state, then broke it down by Assembly
district to show lawmakers the need for their involvement.</TE>
<TE>   Children's weight status was determined by conducting a skin-fold
thickness test to gauge body-fat percentage or by calculating a ratio
of weight to height. The results were then plugged into a formula
based on age and gender. Fitness was measured by one of three timed
running and walking drills.</TE>
<TE>   The report found that although a higher percentage of boys were
overweight than girls, girls were generally less fit. In addition,
fewer older children were overweight but they were more unfit than
younger ones. Both findings require further study, Goldstein said.</TE>
<TE>   On the basis of its findings, the nonprofit public health center
argues that the state should enforce existing law mandating 200 to
400 minutes of physical education every 10 days in grades one through
12. It also advocates finding the money to implement new nutrition
standards for meals served in elementary schools.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to make this [problem of overweight children] seem like
a crisis, because it's a slow-moving crisis, especially when it's
compared to the state going bankrupt," said James Sallis, a professor
of psychology at San Diego State University and an expert on
childhood obesity. "But the longer we put off dealing with these
issues in a fairly aggressive way, the worse they're going to get."</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Martha Escutia (D-Whittier), who sponsored the bill
establishing elementary school nutrition standards, is concerned that
state money won't come through to support her efforts. She hopes to
obtain some federal dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Many school districts have begun to encourage more healthful
eating. In September, the board of the Los Angeles Unified School
District banned the sale of soda and sweetened beverages at middle
and high schools beginning in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Board member Marlene Canter, who spearheaded the ban, said the
district is considering offering healthful lunch options such as
sushi, or pizza made with nutritious ingredients.</TE>
<TE>   "There are many, many students in our middle schools who weigh
over 200 pounds," she said. "Besides the way it makes them feel about
themselves, it's not healthy.... If we don't have healthy kids, we
won't have good instruction."</TE>

<HD>'Left Coast' Stereotype Faces Test</HD>
<DH>The Bay Area's reputation could hinder -- or help -- House
minority leader Pelosi's bid to boost Democrats' appeal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rone Tempest</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The San Francisco-bashing began even before Rep. Nancy Pelosi was
confirmed last month as minority leader of the House of
Representatives.</LD>
<LD>   Repeating a slur from the Ronald Reagan era, critics dismissed
Pelosi, a 62-year-old mother of five, as a "San Francisco Democrat"
who represented a latte-sipping, tree-hugging, Left Coast city that
was light-years from the American mainstream.</LD>
<LD>   Even some Democratic centrists said they feared that Pelosi's
leadership could repel rather than rally voters -- especially the
growing ranks of suburban swing voters -- that Democrats need on
their side if the party is to become dominant again.</LD>
<TE>   Yet, at least some political theorists see this city as a model
for the comeback of the Democratic Party.</TE>
<TE>   "San Francisco is just in the advanced stage of what is going
on in the rest of the country," said John Judis, coauthor of a recent
book that foresees a revitalized Democratic Party rising from just
the sort of socially tolerant, immigrant-friendly, high-tech
professional, environmentalist milieus that San Francisco embodies.</TE>
<TE>   Judis and coauthor Ruy Teixeira also listed Austin, Texas;
Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill, N.C.; Boulder, Colo.; Boston; and Seattle
as crucibles of an "emerging Democratic majority." All of these
locales have voted strongly Democratic in recent elections.</TE>
<TE>   Judis and Teixeira use the term "ideopolises" to describe such
places. They are usually associated with prominent universities,
their economies fueled by intellectual capital.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco may have its cultural quirks, said California
Democratic pollster Paul Maslin, but on many issues that voters worry
about most -- their children's education, the affordability of health
care and prescription drugs and their financial security -- San
Franciscans are just like everybody else.</TE>
<TE>   "A politician, like Pelosi, who speaks to those concerns, will
find receptive audiences in a lot of places," Maslin said.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, David Binder, a local political analyst and pollster,
contends that his city "is never as out of sync with the rest of the
world as others think."</TE>
<TE>   "The issues that San Francisco cares about -- environment, social
justice, health care -- I see as all mainstream issues. San Francisco
is just a little more focused on them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Binder sees San Francisco as a showcase of political consensus
that the national Democratic Party should emulate. "What San
Francisco has shown is that people of color, labor and working
professionals can coalesce around issues," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A Narrow Appeal?</TE>
<TE>   California Republican strategist Dan Schnur, on the other hand,
says Pelosi's district represents a narrow slice of the national
party and thinks Pelosi will have a hard time appealing to Democrats
elsewhere while satisfying her hometown constituents.</TE>
<TE>   "For example, voters in Palo Alto want to hear their candidates
talk about free trade and open markets. Democrats in South San
Francisco aren't going to be nearly as enthusiastic," Schnur said.
"Suburban voters like candidates who support welfare reform and
tough-on-crime legislation that doesn't go over nearly as well in the
city."</TE>
<TE>   And though Democrats have made impressive inroads in the immediate
suburbs, Schnur pointed out, Republicans are putting up big numbers
in the far outlying areas known as exurbs.</TE>
<TE>   Conservative writer David Brooks agrees. "To me," Brooks said in a
debate with Teixeira on National Public Radio, "there is no such
thing as the ideopolis. The crucial political battleground in the
future is between the inner-ring suburbs, which tend to be
Democratic, and the outer-ring suburbs of cities, which tend to be
Republican."</TE>
<TE>   Historically, San Francisco has leaned more to the left than most
other American cities. In the recent California governor's race, San
Franciscans cast more votes for ex-Trotsky socialist Peter Camejo,
the Green Party candidate, then they did for Republican nominee Bill
Simon.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994 nearly 70% of San Francisco voters rejected Proposition
187, which would have made illegal immigrants ineligible for most
public services and education. Although the ballot initiative passed
statewide, it was overturned by state courts.</TE>
<TE>   The city was among the first to endorse gay marriages, and last
year, San Francisco began allowing city employees to have sex-change
operations at public expense.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first city to allow cultivation of marijuana on city
land for medical uses. It pioneered needle exchanges for addicts as a
means of controlling AIDS and other diseases spread by dirty needles.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans in San Francisco say they feel especially isolated.
"We are definitely under siege," said Arthur Bruzzone, a local GOP
leader who served as San Francisco party chairman from 1993 to 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "With the help of the San Francisco media," he said, "the
Republican Party has been successfully demonized here as a bunch of
right-wing nuts. People here are left with the impression that you
have to leave San Francisco's borders to find the ignorant: those who
still believe in family and religion. They've cast the Republican
Party as everything they hold in contempt."</TE>
<TE>   But the cliches about the city being radically out of step with
the rest of America may not ring as true as they did when Jeane
Kirkpatrick, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, coined the
sneering "San Francisco Democrat" phrase at the 1984 Republican
convention. It was an epithet that many saw as a thinly veiled slur
against the city's large gay population.</TE>
<TE>   "My sense is that San Francisco doesn't have the same stigma it
used to have," said Binder.</TE>
<TE>   Carnegie Mellon scholar Richard Florida in his book, "The Rise of
the Creative Class," rates San Francisco as the most dynamic
stronghold of a new economy dominated by ideas, not production.</TE>
<TE>   "Diversity is a powerful force in the value systems and choices of
the new work force, whose members want to work for companies and live
in communities that reflect their openness and tolerance," Florida
concluded</TE>
<TE>   Working with Washington, D.C., Urban Institute demographer Gary
Gates, Florida even developed a correlation between vibrant gay
populations and the high-tech industry.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that the creative people in that industry are
disproportionately gay, Florida said.</TE>
<TE>   "It simply represents a leading indicator that a place is open and
tolerant," he said. The communities with the lowest gay tolerance
rating were those with traditional working-class, industrial
economies.</TE>
<TE>   Other cities have taken San Francisco's cue on domestic partner
legislation, needle exchanges and methadone maintenance programs.</TE>
<TE>   "We are a city that prides itself in taking risks that would
initially seem inappropriate in other cities," said San Francisco
Supervisor Gavin Newsom, who is running for mayor next year. "This
leads to a lot of press coverage and eye rolling. But many of the
things that seemed extreme at the time are becoming the norm over
time."</TE>
<TE>   Newsom also pointed to what he called San Francisco's "staid and
pragmatic" side. He cited the recent defeat of a local public power
initiative favored by progressives and the overwhelming support for
his own initiative cutting cash payments to the city's homeless.</TE>
<TE>   Rated 100% by ADA</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco does tend to vote on the liberal Democratic side on
most issues. Pelosi, for example, has a 100% rating from the liberal
Americans for Democratic Action. Recently she spearheaded
unsuccessful efforts in Congress to restrict President Bush's powers
in waging war against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, as liberal as she is, Pelosi has won elections in San
Francisco without help from the city's most left-wing elements,
notably the Bay Guardian, the city's most prominent progressive
newspaper. It has refused to endorse Pelosi, saying she sold out the
city to developers in her plan to turn the former Presidio Army post
into a national park with some private development to help defray the
cost.</TE>
<TE>   Pelosi has been bucking the Bay Guardian and like-minded voters
for most of her 15-year career in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   She has won -- taking almost 80% of the vote in recent
elections -- through her tireless efforts as a party fund-raiser and her
loyalty to the city's Democratic machine, created by the late Rep.
Phil Burton, whose widow Pelosi succeeded in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Pelosi became a champion of AIDS funding and gained a solid base
in the large Chinese American community with her public leadership on
behalf of human rights in China, joining with conservative
Republicans in the attempt to deny China most-favored nation trade
status.</TE>
<TE>   "San Francisco breeds a kind of political leader who has
to survive in a diverse, highly volatile environment," said San
Francisco State political scientist Richard DeLeon. "It develops
skills of adaptation and leadership that you can't find in a
homogeneous white suburb. It can be an incubator not only for gay
politics but for women in politics."</TE>
<TE>   Many of those who initially opposed Pelosi have come around to her
camp.</TE>
<TE>   School counselor Roberto Rodriguez, 61, and his partner, Bob Van
Horn, 54, recalled voting for gay activist Harry Britt when he ran
against Pelosi in her first congressional race in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   "But I've been happy with Pelosi," Rodriguez said. "She's been
pretty liberal without going overboard. I'm certainly supporting her
now."</TE>
<TE>   Even Republicans are known to voice occasional praise.</TE>
<TE>   "She seems to have her ego very much under control," Bruzzone
said.</TE>
<TE>   "She's hard-working, and she's smart. Before long, I think that
San Francisco label will probably just dislodge itself."</TE>

<HD>Psychiatric Hospital Hit With Sanctions</HD>
<DH>County penalizes West Hills facility for host of
patient-care violations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Fausset</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After uncovering nearly a dozen incidents of sexual misconduct and
other patient-care violations, Los Angeles County mental health
officials said Wednesday they are imposing sanctions against a West
Hills psychiatric hospital that will limit the type of patients it
can treat.</LD>
<LD>   Officials notified Pine Grove Hospital this week that it will no
longer be allowed to detain and treat any new involuntarily admitted
mentally ill patients, a move that could deprive the 80-bed hospital
of a significant portion of its MediCal funding. The mandate, the
severest penalty that county officials can levy, takes effect
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "Our first concern is for the safety of patients and for the
quality of clinical care they are receiving," said David Meyer, chief
deputy director of the county's Department of Mental Health. "On
balance, we decided this is what we needed to do."</LD>
<TE>   Meyer said the county has already begun relocating 15 child
patients at Pine Grove, the only mental health hospital in the San
Fernando Valley that accepts adolescent patients eligible for
MediCal. County officials said their action will very likely place a
significant financial burden on the hospital because many of its
patients are detained involuntarily.</TE>
<TE>   Pine Grove administrator Larry McFarland declined to comment
Wednesday on the county's investigation. But he said his staff
members would "continue to work for the viability of keeping Pine
Grove open" and to ensure the safety of its patients.</TE>
<TE>   The county's action follows a three-month investigation of the
hospital that turned up 11 patient rights violations due to poor
supervision, including sexual assault, sex between minors,
self-mutilation by two patients and a suicide attempt by another with
documented suicidal tendencies, records show.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation of the hospital was launched after a 13-year-old
girl was raped by a 17-year-old fellow patient in August. In the last
three years, law enforcement officials have investigated five
incidents of sexual molestation involving current and former Pine
Grove patients. Two former mental health workers and the 17-year-old
boy have been convicted of sexually assaulting teenage girls they met
at the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Ten separate violations, which occurred between March 2001 and
October 2002, are spelled out in a letter that Meyer wrote to
hospital officials on Oct. 29, informing them of the county's
preliminary decision to restrict patient care.</TE>
<TE>   The letter, obtained by The Times, cites the August rape as one
instance in which a patient's rights were violated. The incident
occurred after hospital workers failed to monitor the hallways of the
adolescent ward, according to an inquiry by the state Department of
Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   The letter also cites two incidents involving consensual sex
between adolescents, and an episode in which poorly supervised
adolescent patients were able to cut themselves. In another incident
in January, a 12-year-old patient was arrested on suspicion of sexual
assault after three female patients reported he had groped them, the
letter said.</TE>
<TE>   In October, the letter stated, a patient with "documented suicidal
intent" was left unsupervised in her room and attempted to hang
herself. According to the letter, the hospital failed to notify
county officials, as they are required to do under the Department of
Mental Health's guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   The incidents, Meyer wrote, were examples of Pine Grove's "failure
to provide adequate supervision and care of patients."</TE>
<TE>   The hospital was given one month to respond to the allegations and
show it had taken steps to improve its operations. In a letter to the
county dated Nov. 8, McFarland listed some of the changes: adolescent
patients were segregated by sex, stricter hallway monitoring rules
were in effect, and patients from Juvenile Hall were no longer
welcome.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital officials also met with county representatives on Monday,
hoping to convince them that the hospital should just be placed on a
closely monitored probation status. Meyer said hospital officials
presented a new course of action that included staffing increases and
physical changes to the facility.</TE>
<TE>   Meyer said the plan was impressive. But it was also expensive, and
county officials worried about the hospital's ability to pay for the
changes, since its parent company, Arizona-based Doctors Community
Healthcare Corp., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in
November.</TE>
<TE>   "We were concerned," Meyer said. "If you can't get the financing
to beef up your operations, then we have concerns about that for your
future, and any corrective action plan."</TE>
<TE>   Pine Grove can still treat patients who check into the hospital of
their own volition. It may also continue to treat involuntarily
detained adults who are currently housed there.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital cannot appeal the county's decision, but it may
eventually reapply for the authority to again expand its patient-care
operations, county officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Pine Grove faces two civil lawsuits brought by the
families of victims of sexual assaults, but both of those suits have
been stayed until further notice from bankruptcy court.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital is also the subject of a separate investigation by
state health officials that could result in a number of sanctions,
from stricter state monitoring to a ban on federal welfare payments.
The results of that investigation may be released by the end of the
month.</TE>
<TE>   A national agency that inspects hospitals, the Joint Commission on
Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, also has opened an inquiry
into sexual misconduct at Pine Grove.</TE>

<HD>39 Layoffs for O.C.'s Planning Agency</HD>
<DH>Employees learn their fate the same day it's announced the
top fiscal manager has been cleared of wrongdoing and will return to
work.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Wilson and Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the day that 39 Orange County Planning Department employees were
laid off, an attorney said Wednesday the agency's top ranking fiscal
manager had been cleared of any wrongdoing and will return to work
after four months on paid leave.</LD>
<LD>   The actions intensify questions about the financial crisis at the
Planning Department, which faces a deficit of at least $2.5 million
and continues to spend $500,000 more than it can afford each month,
according to court and budget documents.</LD>
<LD>   Planning and Development Services Department Director Tom Mathews
promised the Board of Supervisors in August that an outside auditor
would complete a review of the department's finances in September.
That review was delivered to supervisors behind closed doors, without
public review, on Sept. 24.</LD>
<TE>   Meeting records show that the board took no action on the
information.</TE>
<TE>   County Auditor-Controller David Sundstrom said he has now sent in
his staff to investigate the beleaguered agency's books.</TE>
<TE>   Mathews could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, attorney Paul Crost said that Vicki Stewart, manager
of fiscal and program services for the Planning Department, was
informed Dec. 3 that an investigation had been completed and that she
could return to work. Stewart and her chief fiscal analyst were
placed on paid administrative leave in August, after a $2.5-million
hole in the department's budget became public.</TE>
<TE>   Crost represents county managers in collective bargaining. He said
Stewart planned to return to work after the holidays. He did not know
the status of the second manager.</TE>
<TE>   The laid-off employees include 14 veteran building inspectors --
more than a third of the county's inspectors -- and six high-ranking
planners, moves that will have a devastating effect on development
projects, said Nick Berardino, assistant manager for the Orange
County Employees Assn. The union has also hired an auditor and may
sue to stop the layoffs unless the county can prove financial
necessity.</TE>
<TE>   More than three dozen employees met with the county's head of
personnel Wednesday and were told their last day of work would be
Jan. 9, according to Berardino. A few may be reassigned to other
departments, he said. County spokeswoman Diane Thomas confirmed that
there were 39 layoffs and that attempts would be made to help with
job placement. She could not provide more details.</TE>
<TE>   Mathews was not at the meeting. In an e-mail to his employees Dec.
5, , he blamed the layoffs on an unexpected sharp decline in revenues
from building permit fees and build-out of unincorporated county
land.</TE>
<TE>   Berardino described Wednesday's meeting as "not only sad, but
heartbreaking, because it was reliving the [1994 county] bankruptcy
tragedy all over again. Once again, it is top managers who can't
explain the finances, and employees who are paying the price.... It
is a department head who has run that department into the ground, and
innocent employees who came to work each day to do their job who are
the victims."</TE>
<TE>   Berardino said Mathews had told employees in recent months that
layoffs would not be necessary.</TE>
<TE>   He said Mathews met twice with union officials and employee
representatives last week but did not provide details about the
department's finances. The fee issue has been tied up in lawsuit
against the department and there exists the possibility of a second
suit by the union. Barratt American Inc., a national home builder,
sued the department in 1999, saying improperly high permit fees were
being charged.</TE>
<TE>   The department reduced fees and gave some refunds but has paid a
large chunk of its expenses in the last two years from an $18-million
cushion it had piled up from the fees. That reserve has been
depleted.</TE>
<TE>   In additional to the layoffs, Mathews has proposed increases in
permit fees of more than 50% to balance the department's budget. The
Board of Supervisors on Tuesday delayed action on the fee hike.</TE>

<HD>Poundstone Regains Custody of Children</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Comedian Paula Poundstone on Wednesday regained full legal custody of
three adopted children she lost during a child-endangerment
prosecution, her lawyer said.</LD>
<LD>   Poundstone appeared in a juvenile courtroom in Monterey Park, but
it was a formality, said attorney Rich Pfeiffer. Poundstone's
children had already been staying with her for a few days at her
Santa Monica home.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the happiest I've seen her," Pfeiffer said.</LD>
<TE>   Poundstone lost custody of her children after pleading no contest
last year to a felony count of child endangerment and misdemeanor
infliction of injury on a child. The endangerment charge involved
drunk driving with children in her car.</TE>
<TE>   The children were placed with a court-approved foster parent, a
friend of the comedian. Poundstone, 42, was allowed daily monitored
visits with the children.</TE>
<TE>   In October 2001, Poundstone was sentenced to 180 days at a drug
and alcohol rehabilitation center, plus five years of probation.</TE>
<TE>   "She's been alcohol-free for 18 months," Pfeiffer said. "And all
of the sustained child abuse against her -- every bit of it -- was
alcohol-related."</TE>
<TE>   Pheiffer said Poundstone's damaged career is beginning to rebound.</TE>
<TE>   "Her business has suffered, she lost most of her work, but that is
coming back now," he said. "She is a battler, and she is not going to
give up. She has incorporated much of this whole ordeal into her act,
and she's got plenty of material."</TE>

<HD>Robles' Alleged Threats Weren't Serious, Jury Told</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Marosi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A businessman testifying at the trial of South Gate Treasurer Albert
Robles said that Robles' threatening language toward two political
opponents made him "uncomfortable," but that he wasn't worried for
their safety.</LD>
<LD>   The businessman, Mark Kudler, admitted hearing Robles say that, if
he could get away with it, he would cause harm to state Sen. Martha
Escutia (D-Whittier) and her husband, Leo Briones. But Kudler said he
relayed the message to Briones only because he wanted a "cooling off"
period between the couple and Robles.</LD>
<LD>   "I didn't think it was a threat," said Kudler in a heated exchange
with Deputy Dist. Atty. Jennifer Snyder. "I didn't think it was
serious."</LD>
<TE>   Kudler's testimony pertains to a crucial part of the prosecution's
case against Robles, who is charged with threatening to kill Escutia,
Briones, Assemblyman Marco Antonio Firebaugh (D-Los Angeles) and a
South Gate police lieutenant.</TE>
<TE>   Kudler, who accused prosecutors of trying to twist his testimony
in pretrial interviews, only partly confirmed his earlier statements
to police. According to prosecutors, Kudler, in a meeting with Robles
at a Compton casino, heard Robles say that, if he could get away with
it, he would rape Escutia and kill Briones.</TE>
<TE>   On the witness stand, Kudler recounted hearing Robles say that, if
he could get away with it, he would do "something to Escutia." He
said he couldn't recall whether it was "rape" or another word. But
responding to Superior Court Judge John A. Torribio's question,
Kudler acknowledged that the word expressed "bodily harm."</TE>
<TE>   Kudler also later acknowledged that the threatening language
involving Briones was a synonym for "kill" or "murder."</TE>
<TE>   Kudler, who attended the casino meeting with Lynwood Councilman
Fernando Pedroza, said Robles raised his voice when he made the
statements and was expressing anger over political differences with
Escutia and Briones, longtime foes.</TE>
<TE>   But Kudler, describing his reaction to Robles' statement, denied
that he phoned Briones later to warn him. Kudler said he only wanted
to tell Briones that Robles was very angry at him.</TE>
<TE>   Kudler said he was reluctant to be called as a witness in the case
because of its political overtones. "I was concerned that my
statements would be misconstrued," he said. "That this whole thing
was over politics."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys contend that the two legislators pushed the case
against Robles as political retaliation for his successful opposition
to a power plant in South Gate that they supported.</TE>

<HD>Child Abuse Suspect Arrested in Mexico</HD>
<DH>The man, accused of enslaving, torturing and raping
stepdaughter, was at large for three years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Winton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A fugitive wanted on charges of enslaving and sexually abusing his
teenage stepdaughter in El Monte was captured in Mexico after three
years on the run, authorities said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Tito Dominguez, 59, was taken into custody in Gomez Palacios in
the state of Durango, said Laura Bosley, an FBI spokeswoman.</LD>
<LD>   "I am nervous. I'm scared," said the stepdaughter, Melissa, now
22. "But in a way I am happy he finally got caught. I don't want him
to hurt anyone again.''</LD>
<TE>   Melissa, who has a different last name, now lives with a sister.
The Times prefers not to identify victims of sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   The young woman is a student at Rio Hondo Community College trying
to catch up on years of learning. Her parents never enrolled her in
school, according to the charges, but kept her at home, forcing her
instead to perform household chores and endure persistent beatings.
Melissa entered a classroom for the first time in 1997 at age 17.</TE>
<TE>   The child abuse charges against Dominguez, involving multiple rape
counts as well as conspiracy to commit child endangerment, were
characterized by county child-rights advocates as among the worst
they had seen.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very dangerous individual who should be imprisoned for
the rest of his days," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Christina S. Weiss,
who charged Dominguez and prosecuted Dominguez's wife, Maria Carmen
Salcedo. She is serving nine years in prison after pleading no
contest to abusing Melissa, who suffered broken bones and teeth,
burnings, beatings, denial of medical attention and other
indignities. Salcedo was charged with torture and faced a potential
life sentence before entering into a plea bargain.</TE>
<TE>   Melissa appeared on TV's "America's Most Wanted" in 1999 to appeal
for the public's help in finding Dominguez. She had been rescued
after two of her sisters told police that they had been abused.
Police arrested Dominguez in 1997, and that day social workers seized
the remaining children at their home on Allgeyer Street. The home has
since been bulldozed.</TE>
<TE>   Gloria Macias, one of the sisters who had gone to police, was
declared Melissa's conservator in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Dominguez was released after prosecutors determined that there was
not enough evidence to make a case against him.</TE>
<TE>   After inquiries by The Times in 1999, El Monte police renewed the
investigation and re-interviewed Melissa and her sisters. Prosecutors
subsequently charged Dominguez and Salcedo. Authorities said
Dominguez disappeared from the El Paso area, where they believe he
had fled, about that time.</TE>
<TE>   During Salcedo's preliminary hearing, Melissa testified that her
mother had chipped her front teeth with a vacuum cleaner hose, and
she displayed an ear maimed by gnawing and a burn on her hand from
the stove.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said she was choked, never went to school and was called
"Cinderella."</TE>
<TE>   Salcedo, who asked forgiveness at her sentencing, said in an
interview with The Times that Dominguez was to blame for much of the
abuse. She said Dominguez physically abused her and terrorized her.</TE>
<TE>   Dominguez faces up to 60 years in prison if extradited and
convicted. The FBI became involved after El Monte police reported
that he had fled to avoid prosecution. He allegedly enslaved and
raped Melissa, who is slightly mentally retarded and has cerebral
palsy, between 1993 and 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "We just want him behind bars," Macias said. "This is an early
Christmas present for us."</TE>
<TE>   Macias said her sister continues to struggle to learn to read and
write and is enrolled in math and physical education classes at Rio
Hondo.</TE>

<DH>Homemaker out for a walk discovers filled-in marsh near
harbor and takes on its restoration as a personal project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Pool</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The moment that Cathy Beauregard-Covit stepped ankle-deep into the
muddy marsh, she had a sinking feeling she was about to get way over
her head in Los Angeles port politics.</LD>
<LD>   The San Pedro homemaker was doing a good deed for her neighborhood
that February afternoon: picking up trash that had accumulated in a
vacant field near the entrance to Los Angeles Harbor.</LD>
<LD>   She walked across a grassy patch and then made her way through a
swatch of thistles and bushes. Suddenly she was standing in a hidden
pond of water that seemed to materialize out of nowhere.</LD>
<TE>   Glancing around, Beauregard-Covit noticed that she was surrounded
by cattails and reeds and a thick stand of sawgrass . Birds startled
by her presence exploded from the bushes and noisily flew away.
Darting through the water at her feet were small fish.</TE>
<TE>   "I had walked into another world," said the 39-year-old mother of
two. "There were bugs and birds, all sorts of life hidden in the
heliotrope and marsh grass. And where had the fish come from? This
little patch of land was alive and bustling."</TE>
<TE>   Beauregard-Covit had rediscovered a long forgotten natural
freshwater wetland that helped form the saltwater marsh discovered
450 years ago by Portuguese explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo. He
named the area Bahia de los Fumos -- "Bay of Smokes" -- from the
fires set by Indians living on the hills above San Pedro Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Workers began filling in the tidal flatlands in the early 1900s as
Los Angeles officials dredged and enlarged the harbor. By the late
1930s, the Army Corps of Engineers had covered over the marsh near
Crescent Avenue close to the mouth of the harbor.</TE>
<TE>   The filled-in area was used by the Union Oil Co. for petroleum
storage during the 1950s. When the firm's lease ended, its huge tanks
were removed.</TE>
<TE>   These days, harbor officials are looking at redevelopment of the
33-acre site. Ideas so far range from construction of townhouses to
development of a retail "boat mall" for sailors and yachtsmen to
creation of an athletic complex, according to Doug Epperhart,
president of the Coastal San Pedro Neighborhood Council.</TE>
<TE>   But for now, the parcel, bounded by Crescent, 22nd Street and the
southern extension of Harbor Boulevard, remains barren. Except for
the acre or so at the southwest corner -- where Beauregard-Covit
found herself last February.</TE>
<TE>   After wading out of the marsh and cleaning the mud off her shoes,
she excitedly set out to learn how a natural wetland and miniature
wildlife habitat could possibly exist surrounded by homes on one side
and by one of the world's busiest shipping ports on the other.</TE>
<TE>   She collected a sample of the pond water and took it to her
12-year-old son Daniel's seventh-grade science teacher for analysis.
It was fresh water, and it was loaded with some of the most
interesting microorganisms he had ever seen, the teacher reported
back.</TE>
<TE>   She went to the neighborhood council, of which she is secretary,
to suggest that cleanup of the tiny marsh be designated as a council
beautification project.</TE>
<TE>   She mapped out a proposal to build a pathway around a small berm
that long ago had been constructed to keep the water from seeping
into the old tank farm site. The path could be used by schoolchildren
interested in viewing the wildlife and the freshwater pond.</TE>
<TE>   The freshwater marsh is within walking distance of the Cabrillo
saltwater marsh, and students could easily compare life forms in the
two environments on one field trip, she decided.</TE>
<TE>   Beauregard-Covit began researching the history of San Pedro,
perusing old photographs to chart the harbor's development and the
in-filling of its tidelands. She tracked down San Pedro natives who
remembered hunting frogs and playing in the spring-fed marsh.</TE>
<TE>   She organized a larger clean-up of the wetlands in June. Neighbors
and Girl Scouts pitched in and collected 30 bags of trash. Taking
note, harbor officials promised to remove the remnants of an old
homeless encampment at the edge of the marsh that the volunteers were
unable to handle.</TE>
<TE>   The marsh was now coming to life publicly. The Sierra Club
approved a resolution in support of preservation of the freshwater
habitat. Its Los Angeles chapter's leaders praised what they labeled
as "a one-woman wetlands restoration project."</TE>
<TE>   "It's unique in the sense that here you have an individual with a
very narrowly focused, pragmatic vision for the marsh that some might
think is too small to be important," explained Tom Politeo, founder
of the club's Harbor Vision Task Force. "Here, an individual has seen
hope in a small parcel of land other people would overlook."</TE>
<TE>   The marsh restoration received a setback a month ago, however.</TE>
<TE>   The bulldozer sent by harbor officials to clear away the
encampment mistakenly graded over the wetlands as well. The cattails,
reeds and native bushes were flattened and the earthen berm was
knocked down and pushed into the ponds.</TE>
<TE>   Beauregard-Covit and others were devastated. "I was with my boys
when I saw what had happened. My littlest started crying. I thought,
'Oh no! The community was right -- the harbor department just wants
to destroy it,' " she said.</TE>
<TE>   But harbor officials quickly apologized.</TE>
<TE>   "The bulldozer operator was just overzealous," explained Gilbert
Flores, a consulting landscape architect for the port.</TE>
<TE>   While some harbor officials have told Beauregard-Covit that steps
will be taken to "fix" the marsh, aides to Larry Keller, the
department's executive director, said he was unavailable for comment
this week.</TE>
<TE>   But City Councilwoman Janice Hahn, who represents San Pedro, said
it may be up to the tidelands regulators on the state Lands
Commission to act on preservation of the tiny wetlands. The port
holds the land around the marsh in trust for the state.</TE>
<TE>   She said protection of the miniature marsh fits with the desire
for the preservation of open space around the port expressed last
week in a "State of the Harbor" address by Mayor James Hahn. He said
he wants to make it a destination for tourists and residents instead
of an eyesore.</TE>
<TE>   "I was extremely surprised we had our own little marshland until
Cathy brought it to my attention," the councilwoman said. "It's a
resource we should look to protect and enhance."</TE>
<TE>   The marsh, meantime, is oozing back to life.</TE>
<TE>   Several ponds have re-formed, and the bulldozed cattails are
starting to re-sprout. Tracks of raccoons, opossums and other animals
can be seen in the muddy ground around the water, but none of the
mosquito fish from the old ponds survived.</TE>
<TE>   "We have such a gem right here," Beauregard-Covit said this week,
delighted to find herself also leaving tracks in mud once more.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an awesome place that's been here longer than we know. And
it doesn't want to die."</TE>

<HD>7 Gang Members Held in Morning Raids</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seven people in the Antelope Valley were arrested in early morning
raids targeting gang members suspected of probation or parole
violations, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The surprise 5 a.m. sweep Wednesday was the first time the Los
Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department
combined forces for an operation in the Antelope Valley.</LD>
<LD>   The 50-person task force, led by the LAPD's Special Enforcement
Unit, searched 24 locations. Arrests were made involving possession
of narcotics for sale, receiving stolen property and parole and
probation violations.</LD>
<TE>   "These guys are known gang members from various active San
Fernando Valley gangs and this is a strategy we are using to suppress
gang violence," said Cmdr. Michel Moore of the LAPD's Operations
Valley Bureau. "We received information from our gang officers about
certain gang members who were living in the Antelope Valley."</TE>
<TE>   The raids were the first in a series of joint operations being
aimed at gang members committing crimes in the San Fernando Valley,
Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   "We want the gang members to know we are going to be working with
the sheriff and whatever resources we have to reduce violence," Moore
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department welcomes the joint effort, said Lt. Mike
Ford of the department's Safe Streets Bureau, which handles gang
crime.</TE>
<TE>   "The new [LAPD] police chief [William J. Bratton] has put a focus
on gangs and they are certainly a problem in the county, too," he
said. "If we can combine forces to address that problem, it works out
best for everybody involved, particularly the community."</TE>

<HD>Street Racing Suspected in Deadly Crash</HD>
<DH>Santa Paula grandfather driving home from church is killed
when a teen rams his pickup from behind.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Chawkins</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It had been a happy occasion.</LD>
<LD>   The Zermeno family was delighted to see their youngest grandchild
in a Christmas program at a Ventura church.</LD>
<LD>   But 65-year-old Jose Zermeno never made it home. He was killed
Tuesday night when a teen who allegedly was drag-racing slammed into
Zermeno's red pickup on California 126.</LD>
<TE>   Genaro Mejia, 18, of Santa Paula, whose car hit Zermeno's, was
treated for minor injuries at Santa Paula Memorial Hospital and
released.</TE>
<TE>   A California Highway Patrol spokesman said Wednesday that no
arrests have been made pending an investigation.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Zermeno's widow, Delfina, a third-grade teacher in
Oxnard, grieved at home. One of his three grown daughters, also named
Delfina Zermeno, couldn't help but see a sad irony in her father's
death.</TE>
<TE>   "He was such a slow driver," she said. "He was like Mr. Perfect.
He just couldn't break the law."</TE>
<TE>   Zermeno had left the church in his pickup a few minutes before
family members followed him back to his Santa Paula home in another
vehicle. Slowly passing the accident scene just west of Briggs Road,
they realized with horror that the victim was Jose.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no one like him around anymore," his daughter said
through her tears. "He was the most honest person you could ever
meet."</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses told officers that Mejia and a 16-year-old passenger
appeared to be racing another car on California 118 through Saticoy,
occasionally crossing double-yellow lines. Merging onto California
126, the two allegedly continued racing until Mejia's 1999 black
Chevy Malibu hit the rear of Zermeno's pickup, according to the CHP.</TE>
<TE>   Zermeno's truck veered off the freeway and hit a tree. He was
pronounced dead at the scene. Mejia smashed into a guardrail on the
center divider.</TE>
<TE>   The driver of the other car, described as a dark-colored Honda
sedan with tinted windows and customized wheel rims, fled. He is
being sought by police.</TE>
<TE>   Zermeno was said to be a gentle man and an exceptional listener.</TE>
<TE>   "He had coffee in the morning with the elderly people at
McDonald's," daughter Delfina said. "He said they were very wise and
he loved to hear them talk. He said you could learn a lot from them."</TE>
<TE>   A Santa Paula resident for about 40 years, Zermeno was a disc
jockey for years and later was a sales manager at a car dealership.
Most recently, he was a custodian for the Santa Paula Elementary
School District.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, though, he devoted himself to his family, particularly his
four young grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   "His family was his world," his daughter said.</TE>
<TE>   Zermeno was related to a number of people in local law
enforcement. His brother, Sheriff's Sgt. Ralph Zermeno, was on duty
the night of the crash.</TE>
<TE>   If Mejia was racing, Zermeno's death would be the second in
Ventura County this year blamed on illegal street competitions. In
April, the 19-year-old mother of a month-old baby was killed and her
boyfriend seriously injured as they raced the boyfriend's brother
down Rose Avenue in El Rio.</TE>
<TE>   Street racers congregate -- sometimes by the hundreds -- in a
number of shopping center parking lots on Saturday nights, said
Officer Steve Reid, a CHP spokesman. Sometimes they choose spots to
race by using police scanners to figure out where officers are not
likely to be on patrol.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a fairly sophisticated system," Reid said. "It's really
hard to catch these guys."</TE>

<HD>Boalt Names Professor as Interim Dean</HD>
<DH>Selection at law school is praised. He replaces John Dwyer,
accused of sexual harassment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stuart Silverstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Acting to replace an administrator who resigned over a sexual
harassment complaint, UC Berkeley on Wednesday named one of its
longtime professors to serve as interim dean of Boalt Hall law
school.</LD>
<LD>   The professor is Robert C. Berring Jr., 53, who for the last 20
years has taught at the law school and directed the law library. He
will replace John P. Dwyer, 51, who is stepping down effective Jan. 1
after the harassment complaint linked to an encounter he had two
years ago with a student then at Boalt.</LD>
<LD>   Berring, a popular professor who writes an advice column for
students under the pen name "Uncle Zeb," graduated from Harvard in
1971 with a bachelor's degree in government and Chinese studies.</LD>
<TE>   He later earned both his law degree and a master's degree in
library and information studies at Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   He said he is still studying the key issues he will face in the
new role.</TE>
<TE>   "I started out as a law librarian, and teaching about China. And
Confucius said that wisdom lies in knowing what you don't know," he
said. "That makes me a very wise man right now, because there's a
world I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Asked how he would respond to assertions recently by women's
groups that Boalt has not acted adequately to prevent sexual
harassment, Berring said he wants to "make it as good an environment
for students as possible, so I'll be open to talking to anybody about
anything."</TE>
<TE>   His appointment was praised by Laura Stevens, the lawyer
representing the former Boalt student who lodged the complaint
against Dwyer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's critical right now in this moment of transition and change
that they have someone who is such a good choice," Stevens said. "He
is respected by women faculty, the students -- he's a good, sensible,
funny fellow."</TE>
<TE>   UC Berkeley said it is putting together a committee to conduct a
nationwide search, beginning in early 2003, for a permanent dean for
the law school. Berring said he has not decided whether to put his
name in the running.</TE>
<TE>   University Chancellor Robert M. Berdahl, in a statement, called
Berring "the ideal person to lead the law school during the search
for a permanent dean. He has substantial administrative experience,
enjoys the widespread respect and trust of his colleagues and
students, and has experience reaching out to alumni and other friends
of the law school."</TE>
<TE>   Berring, a native of Canton, Ohio, is married and has two sons.</TE>
<TE>   He lives in Oakland with his second wife, Leslie, who was
registrar of the law school until leaving the job two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The appointment was also lauded by Valerie Meyer, editor-in-chief
of the Berkeley Women's Law Journal. "He's well-known among the
students," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Meyer added that Berring is known for his open-door policy. If a
student has "difficulties or problems, he's always willing to talk,"
she said.</TE>

<LD>Sacramento</LD>
<LD>   Legislators have been ducking and delaying, bumbling and mumbling.
A lot of mumbling. But look closely, and you'll also see important
movement.</LD>
<LD>   Monday, they opened a special session called by Gov. Gray Davis to
confront the gargantuan budget deficit, now predicted to be around
one-third of the state general fund. Then the lawmakers promptly
recessed until after the holidays, except for some made-for-TV public
hearings around California next week.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't want to rush into it," said Senate leader John Burton
(D-San Francisco). "We want to know who's getting hurt. We want to
know exactly what we're doing."</TE>
<TE>   That's mostly staff work, in legislators' minds.</TE>
<TE>   Davis last Friday proposed a $10.2-billion budget-cutting package
to help plug a hole projected at $22 billion minimum, and probably
closer to $30 billion. But Burton said it would "be stupid" to cut
any spending before the governor sends the Legislature his full
budget proposal Jan. 10. Nobody expects much action until at least
late January.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of the slow motion, however, there have been
significant stirrings inside the Capitol, especially by Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans this week acknowledged publicly -- actually, they
whispered it -- that it will be impossible to balance the budget only
with spending cuts. As strange as it might seem, that's progress.</TE>
<TE>   They still don't accept the Democratic doctrine as expressed by
Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) during a brief admonition to the
Assembly on Monday: "It's time to recognize that we won't solve this
problem at the extremes. Not with tax increases alone and not with
cuts alone....</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot ask for sacrifices from those who can't afford it,
while asking nothing from those who can."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans won't even think about a tax increase, they insist.
And virtually any tax hike except a boost in the vehicle license fee
(good for $3.8 billion) would require a two-thirds vote of each
house, meaning some GOP support.</TE>
<TE>   So the Republican alternative is to borrow from the Washington
playbook and roll over the deficit into the next budget year. Shove
the debt from the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2003, into the one
starting in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The two Republican leaders -- Sen. Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga
and Assemblyman Dave Cox of Fair Oaks -- say they're studying this
possible rollover of red ink. "It's consciously doing what the
Legislature does anyway," Brulte says. "We'd just be upfront and
honest about it."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, there's tantalizing language in the state Constitution
implying -- to a layman, anyway -- that a governor could roll over
the deficit simply by declaring a state of war. The Constitution
decrees that no rollover debt may exceed $300,000 "except in the case
of war to repel invasion or suppress insurrection."</TE>
<TE>   Aren't terrorists invading? Maybe from Iraq?</TE>
<TE>   Probably wouldn't sell.</TE>
<TE>   More likely, this idea is headed for the ballot at a statewide
special election.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats ordinarily might like the deficit rollover -- it'd keep
the disabled in nursing homes, kids in manageable class sizes -- but
there's a GOP hitch: Republicans would demand a short-term spending
freeze. They'd also insist on a permanent spending cap, perhaps tied
to the growth of personal income.</TE>
<TE>   That must be embedded in the Constitution, Republicans feel,
because Democrats can't be trusted to keep on any cap.</TE>
<TE>   "There has to be a spending cap and one that's real and acted on
by voters," Brulte says.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, he adds, "we should start with the governor's
[proposed] cuts. Freeze spending. Let revenues catch up. You can't
solve this problem in one year."</TE>
<TE>   Brulte also says Republicans will advocate a one-year moratorium
on new business regulations and a delay in benefit increases for
workers' compensation insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Says Cox: "What my colleagues and I are interested in is balancing
the budget without raising taxes. What we really want to do is
stimulate the economy.... And this is what we are thinking."</TE>
<TE>   "At least they are thinking," concedes Burton.</TE>
<TE>   Thinking outside the box. Mulling and moving. Wesson's not
particularly interested.</TE>
<TE>   "Roll this over for a year? Big deal!" he says. "We've got a
revenue problem in this state. We need to come up with something
that's stable.</TE>
<TE>   "And a spending cap? Just because we're in a fiscal crisis they
want to handcuff the ability of future legislatures to do their job
-- because they view this as an opportunity to handcuff [legislators]
who are in the majority."</TE>
<TE>   Davis also is said to be leery of rolling over debt. He wants to
bring spending and revenues into sync now with painful cuts and tax
hikes.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic legislators are considering ballot measures of their
own to raise taxes -- perhaps on the highest income earners (above
$260,000 for joint filers) and business property. They'd try to offer
voters a choice: Sock old folks and poor kids, or tap the rich.</TE>
<TE>   Also, they're talking about a ballot measure that would allow
legislators to pass budgets and raise taxes by majority vote.</TE>
<TE>   Things at the Capitol seem slowly headed toward a special
election, maybe next fall. If you've bemoaned ballot-box budgeting in
the past, just wait.</TE>

<HD>Whooping Cough Cases Up Sharply in the Southland</HD>
<DH>Health officials see no reason for the trend. Orange County
has been hard hit. Most at risk are babies who haven't completed
vaccinations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Gottlieb</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whooping cough, a once-dreaded childhood disease that became a rarity
a generation ago, is up sharply across Southern California,
particularly in Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   Health officials counted 96 cases of the disease -- including two
deaths -- through Nov. 29 in Orange County, compared to 15 cases in
the same period last year. The figure is higher than any annual total
recorded since 1958, when there were 133 cases.</LD>
<LD>   Similar patterns, though less dramatic, are seen elsewhere in the
region. Los Angeles County, with about 120 cases and two deaths, is
running about 20% above last year's figure.</LD>
<TE>   The trend is part of a general rise that has been underway for
years and far exceeds population growth. Nationally, the number of
cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control has grown more than
seven-fold over the last 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the increase is seen in babies who have not completed
their vaccinations, said A. Nelson El Amin, medical director of the
Los Angeles County Immunization Program.</TE>
<TE>   But the reason for the increase remains a puzzle.</TE>
<TE>   "No one really knows the answer why there's this long-term trend
of gradual increase, even though immunization coverage has gotten
higher," said Dr. Loring Dales, medical officer in the Immunization
Branch of the California Department of Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   Whooping cough was a major cause of death among infants before the
vaccine was introduced in the mid-1940s.</TE>
<TE>   The disease, also called pertussis, is caused by a bacteria that
is spread when a sick person coughs. The disease is characterized by
fits of coughing so severe that the victim may turn blue around the
mouth as a result of lack of oxygen.</TE>
<TE>   The disease gets its name from the high-pitched "whoop" the sick
person makes when trying to suck in air while coughing.</TE>
<TE>   Whooping cough can kill by cutting off the oxygen supply or by
leading to secondary infections such as pneumonia. The bacteria also
produce toxins that can kill. The disease is treated with
antibiotics.</TE>
<TE>   Children receive whooping cough immunizations as part of the DPT
or DTaP series, along with diphtheria and tetanus vaccines. The
series of five vaccinations are recommended at 2, 4 and 6 months,
between 12 and 18 months, and between 4 and 6 years. The complete
series is required in California before a child enters kindergarten.</TE>
<TE>   When the series is completed, the vaccine is about 85% effective.
Unlike the measles vaccine, the pertussis series wears off after
several years. When introduced, the vaccine dramatically reduced the
number of cases of whooping cough, which peaked at 21,344 in
California in 1941, killing 112. The number of cases dropped to 75 in
1976.</TE>
<TE>   The disease runs in cycles, spiking higher for three to four years
and then falling. But beneath that has been the general trend of an
increasing number of cases. The peak in recent years was 1,140 in
1999.</TE>
<TE>   According to the CDC, the number of whooping cough cases among
children 6 months to 4 years old has remained stable, meaning the
vaccine still works. Babies who catch the disease before their
vaccinations are complete are infected by adults who may not realize
they have whooping cough.</TE>

<HD>Justices Deny Davis Appeal in Attack Ads Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The California Supreme Court refused Wednesday to hear an appeal by
Gov. Gray Davis' reelection committee in a lawsuit seeking the
identity of the financial supporters for TV commercials attacking the
governor's handling of the state energy crisis.</LD>
<LD>   The suit alleged that the American Taxpayers Alliance -- the group
behind the ads -- was operating a political campaign and should have
to reveal details about its organization and financial support. A San
Francisco Superior Court judge in September 2001 ordered the alliance
to register as a financial committee and identify its donors, but a
Court of Appeal overturned the ruling this September.</LD>
<LD>   The Davis committee sought to have the state Supreme Court set
aside that ruling, said James Harrison, a San Leandro attorney
representing the committee.</LD>
<TE>   In a statement, Davis called the Supreme Court decision "a sad day
for democracy."</TE>

<HD>Riverside County Sees Hitch in Tollway Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Weikel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Riverside County officials say they might withhold critical support
for the sale of a controversial tollway to the Orange County
Transportation Authority unless the agency removes a provision in the
deal similar to one that has blocked improvements to the heavily
congested Riverside Freeway for years.</LD>
<LD>   Documents being prepared for the purchase of the 91 Express Lanes
echo a non-compete agreement between Caltrans and California Private
Transportation Co., owner of the toll lanes running along 10 miles of
the Riverside Freeway west of the county line. Ironically, protests
over that agreement fueled the sale in the first place.</LD>
<LD>   The provision is designed to protect the owner's revenue by
barring the state from widening the heavily congested freeway for 30
miles, including the stretch of toll lanes. OCTA plans to continue
collecting tolls until it has paid off debt taken on to buy the
lanes.</LD>
<TE>   Riverside County officials said the non-compete wording must be
stripped from the sale agreements or neutralized before they will
drop their lawsuit against Caltrans and the tollway owner. The case
challenges the legality of the existing non-compete agreement and
must be dismissed before the deal can proceed.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA has repeatedly promised that the authority's purchase of the
Express Lanes will end the highly controversial non-compete agreement
and clear the way for Orange and Riverside counties to make $1.6
billion in improvements. The $207-million deal is set to close Jan.
2.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA officials Wednesday described the new problem as a minor
hitch that can be easily solved. No matter what, they pointed out,
non-compete clauses are banned by recent state legislation that
granted OCTA the power to charge tolls.</TE>
<TE>   The current restrictions, which would expire in 2030 if the sale
does not take place, have been a source of political tension between
Orange County, which originally supported the tollway, and Riverside
County, whose motorists pay one of the highest tolls in the nation.</TE>

<LD>The Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education
unanimously approved a resolution this week requiring Supt. Roy Romer
to create a plan within six months to close the academic achievement
gap separating African American and Latino students from their Asian
and white peers.</LD>
<LD>   "If you measure it with standardized tests, more African American
and Latino students are failing reading and math," board member Jose
Huizar said.</LD>
<LD>   On the most recent Stanford 9 basic skills exam, African Americans
and Latinos scored in the 34th percentile overall, compared with the
67th percentile for whites and the 70th for Asians, according to the
school district.</LD>
<TE>   The resolution, which was sponsored by Huizar and fellow board
members Genethia Hudley-Hayes and David Tokofsky, requires Romer to
show how current curriculum, instruction and staff development
programs will close the learning gap.</TE>
<TE>   The districtwide reading and math programs for elementary
students, which have been praised for boosting test scores, and the
recently established middle and high school literacy plan will also
be reviewed, Huizar said.</TE>
<TE>   The schools that rank lowest on the state's Academic Performance
Index are predominantly African American or Latino and are located in
some of the highest poverty areas in Los Angeles, Huizar said.</TE>

<DH>El Nido offers programs on teen pregnancy and breaking
poverty cycle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Sachs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>People like to say that children are the future, but for the El Nido
Family Centers of Los Angeles County, that future is now.</LD>
<LD>   The organization, which has been around in one form or another
since 1925, promotes the social and emotional development of youths
and their families in the region. Many of its clients are from
economically disadvantaged households.</LD>
<LD>   Liz Herrera, who assumed the position of executive director in
July after nearly three decades with the organization, said the
precarious economy is making El Nido's work particularly challenging
these days.</LD>
<TE>   "Funding for social services agencies is always a struggle in
times like these, and I know this is going to be a really tough
budget year for the state," she said. "But it's when the economy is
bad that social problems tend to increase, so it's really the worst
time to cut back funding."</TE>
<TE>   Herrera said El Nido Family Centers, which employs about 180
people on a budget this fiscal year of $8.7 million, gets most of its
funding from the state. She said the agency's programs may have to be
trimmed next year, unless the economy picks up.</TE>
<TE>   El Nido breaks its service programs into five components: teen
pregnancy prevention, teen pregnancy counseling, child abuse
treatment, delinquency prevention and parental education. There are
11 service sites scattered throughout the county.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of our clientele is made up of teen parents," Herrera said.
"We have high-risk programs that deal with the younger siblings of
these teen parents, because they are more likely to run into the same
kind of problems later on.</TE>
<TE>   "We have case managers who work with the teens and their families
one on one," she continued, "because many times the teen's parents
were teen parents themselves, so our goal is to stop the cycle.</TE>
<TE>   "If you cut programs, you're going to end up paying one way or
another. You either pay with prevention or you end up paying for
babies in neonatal units," Herrera said.</TE>
<TE>   El Nido also tries to help young people break out of poverty and
learn to handle money.</TE>
<TE>   Working with Merrill Lynch, the agency has a program to teach
youngsters the value of math, reading and computer skills in the
workplace. Enrollees learn how to improve their research and
organizational skills, and to work as members of a team.</TE>
<TE>   El Nido Centers received a $6,000 grant from last year's Times
Holiday Campaign. During this holiday season, The Times is featuring
programs that have benefited from the fund-raising effort.</TE>
<TE>   Recipients are charities serving Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura, San
Bernardino and Riverside counties. More than 50 groups shared the
$653,000 raised in last year's campaign.</TE>

<HD>Water Deal Talks to Resume</HD>
<DH>With a big portion of the region's supply on the line,
officials will meet in Las Vegas on Sunday.</DH>

<LD>After two days of rancor, officials from water agencies involved in a
proposed deal to help coastal Southern California avert a threatened
reduction in Colorado River water agreed on Wednesday to renew talks
aimed at a settlement.</LD>
<LD>   Representatives of the water agencies plan to meet Sunday in Las
Vegas to see if objections to the deal raised by the Imperial
Irrigation District can be overcome.</LD>
<LD>   The deal, which the Imperial district's board rejected Monday,
called for farmers served by Imperial to fallow some farmland.
Imperial would then sell the freed-up water to San Diego.</LD>
<TE>   Board members said that fallowing land would hurt their region
economically and that the deal did not protect the district
sufficiently against possible future costs for environmental damage
to the Salton Sea, which survives on water that runs off farms.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting was scheduled after a day of telephone calls among
state and federal officials and board members and staff members of
the four agencies: the Imperial district, the San Diego County Water
Authority, the Coachella Valley Water District and the Metropolitan
Water District of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials have said they will move to sharply cut
California's take of water from the Colorado if the state cannot meet
a Dec. 31 deadline for reaching an agreement on how to bring about a
gradual reduction in its use of the river.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good sign that we're still continuing to discuss things,"
said Dennis Cushman, assistant general manager of the San Diego
County Water Authority. "This 7 -1/2 year process has had fits and
starts. We had a fit, and now we'll have a start."</TE>
<TE>   The Sunday meeting is set for a conference room at Caesars Palace
in the hours before the annual convention of the Colorado River Water
Users Assn. It is anticipated that the convention will attract nearly
a thousand water officials from seven states as well as U.S.
Department of Interior Secretary Gale Norton.</TE>
<TE>   She is scheduled to speak to the association and is expected to
severely criticize Imperial and the other agencies for failing to
reach agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Among the officials trying to cajole the four agencies into
resuming negotiations is state Sen. Michael Machado (D-Linden), soon
to be named chairman of the Senate's Agriculture and Water Committee.
Machado said he is working in conjunction with Gov. Gray Davis and
Resources Secretary Mary Nichols to get the four agencies talking,
rather than exchanging angry quotes in the media.</TE>
<TE>   "We've all vented a little bit; now it's time to move on," Machado
said.</TE>
<TE>   He said San Diego, Coachella and Metropolitan should take
seriously the Imperial district's concerns about the Salton Sea and
fallowing.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand their problems from a farmer-to-farmer perspective
as someone who also has to depend on water for his livelihood,"
Machado said.</TE>
<TE>   Though calling on the other three agencies to take Imperial
seriously, Machado warned Imperial not to attempt to reopen
negotiations on the issue of the price San Diego will pay for the
water. Some Imperial board members have complained that the price is
too low.</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Gastelum, chief executive officer of Metropolitan, said he
spoke to Imperial officials Wednesday but did not receive a clear
recitation of their reasons for voting no.</TE>
<TE>   There may not be the "political will" for the Imperial board to
ratify a water sale in the face of angry and passionate opposition
from some farmers and business leaders, he said.</TE>

<HD>A Win-Win Situation for Man in Lotto, Fantasy 5</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BELMONT, Calif.</DL>
<LD>There's no use telling Angelo Gallina how long the odds are of
winning the California Lottery. He beat those odds twice in the same
day, winning the $17-million SuperLotto Plus jackpot and the $126,000
Fantasy 5 top prize.</LD>
<LD>   Gallina won in the draws conducted Nov. 20, an astounding feat
considering the chances of taking home the top prize in each -- let
alone both.</LD>
<LD>   What will he do first, now that he's beaten the odds?</LD>
<TE>   "I think I'll eat cake," Gallina told lottery officials. He said a
new car and a home for his grown children are also in store.</TE>
<TE>   State lottery officials put the odds for the SuperLotto contest
win at 1 in 41 million. The odds of winning the separate Fantasy 5
contest is 1 in 575,000.</TE>
<TE>   The odds of one person winning both draws on the same day requires
a calculator and lots of zeros.</TE>
<TE>   "One in 23 trillion," said Mike Orkin, a professor of statistics
at Cal State Hayward and author of "What Are the Odds?" -- a book
about games of chance and the odds of everyday occurrences.</TE>
<TE>   To reach that figure Orkin multiplied 41 million by 575,000,
resulting in 23,575,000,000,000. He said a more accurate reflection
of the odds for this particular win would vary depending on how many
tickets the couple bought and how often they played the lottery.</TE>
<TE>   But are the odds of this occurrence almost astronomical?</TE>
<TE>   "You can take off the 'almost,' " Orkin said.</TE>

<HD>MTA May Increase Contract for Rail Cars by $13.8 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kurt Streeter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is considering adding $13.8
million today to a long troubled contract with the manufacturer of
its light-rail cars, raising concern on the MTA board that the agency
has mishandled the purchase and acquisition of its trains.</LD>
<LD>   The MTA staff has recommended that the agency's board boost the
$201.4-million contract with Siemens Transportation Systems by $13.8
million. The agency says the money is needed to close out a deal that
has dragged on since 1993.</LD>
<LD>   Originally, MTA contracted with the Sacramento-based Siemens to
provide 72 sleek P-2000 rail cars for $215.4 million, though it
eventually lowered the number to 52 cars and reduced the value of the
contract.</LD>
<TE>   Almost from the start, the MTA and Siemens have sparred over the
contract.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA alleged that Siemens has been as much as three years late
delivering its cars. Significant numbers of those cars have arrived
at the MTA with problems ranging from paint flaws to breakdowns in
power systems, according to internal MTA documents obtained by The
Times.</TE>
<TE>   Siemens contended that the cars it was delivering met
specifications and that changes in the design of the cars caused
delays.</TE>
<TE>   An MTA spokesman said that most of the $13.8-million increase
would pay for the increased oversight of the Siemens contract, with
$2.75 million for claims made by Siemens related to extra work the
company says it has been forced to do.</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor and MTA board member Yvonne Brathwaite Burke,
whose district includes the agency's Blue and Green Line railways,
said she was very concerned that adding millions of dollars to the
contract would be wasteful.</TE>
<TE>   Siemens officials had no comment on the matter.</TE>

<LD>Call it a tree for what ails ya. It graces the counter of the
Memorial Medical Group office in Long Beach and it's festooned with
tiny empty boxes. Boxes that held prescription drugs. There are even
antidepressant containers, perhaps to cheer up Scrooge types.</LD>
<LD>   And the decoration at the top? It's a Viagra box. O, Christmas
tree!</LD>
<LD>   More cheer: Marty Rauch of West L.A. and Beverley Taub of Woodland
Hills got a kick out of a multicultural holiday greeting printed in
one market mailer (see accompanying).</LD>
<TE>   Heavenly dividends: Noting the "life" and "thereafter" notations
in a bank ad (see accompanying), Bill Scannell of Santa Ana observed
that apparently you can take it with you (and earn extra interest,
too).</TE>
<TE>   Which reminds me: In Minnesota, Peter Burke of Hollywood saw a
funeral home with an appropriate name (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Back to the world of high finance: A survey of Civic Center
cafeterias by the L.A. Downtown News found that the Department of
Water and Power's eatery accepts cash only. "But," a waitress told
the newspaper, "we don't require ID."</TE>
<TE>   Vacationer's warning: Despite what the sign in Sedona, Ariz., may
say, Vera McDaniel of Culver City recommends that you be careful
where you take your camera (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   There are 8 million stories in the semi-naked city: The locker
room of my health club was largely deserted the other afternoon as I
changed into my bathing suit. I was about to walk into the shower
area when I heard a loud argument inside. It was one-sided, with a
guy saying he didn't have to take that kind of talk, etc. I admit I
hesitated.</TE>
<TE>   I'm practically blind without my glasses and I didn't want to walk
into the middle of a fistfight between some young guys and suffer
collateral damage. Then, suddenly, there was silence. The dispute
seemed to have ended without the second guy ever getting in a word.</TE>
<TE>   As I tiptoed into the shower area, I found out why. The first
disputant, wrapped only in a towel, had just set down his cell phone.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: The city of Paramount received a report that a car was
sitting in the middle of the street. The owner explained that he had
left it there so the street sweeper would have room to go around on
both sides.</TE>

<HD>Suspect Held in Shooting of Park Ranger</HD>
<DH>She was wounded in the knee. Authorities said the way
officers do their jobs could now change.</DH>

<LD>A man suspected of carjacking and shooting a state ranger at a park
in the Santa Cruz Mountains was arrested Wednesday in San Jose.</LD>
<LD>   The ranger, a 16-year veteran who is the first California parks
officer on record to be shot while on duty, was recovering from a
bullet wound to the knee, according to the state Department of Parks
and Recreation.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, a spokesman for the parks department said the shooting
could change the way rangers go about their jobs.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities said the shooting occurred Tuesday morning, when
Supervising Ranger Sharon Galligan tried to cite a man for illegal
camping in Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park, which is closed for the
season.</TE>
<TE>   The man shot Galligan once before fleeing in a pickup truck that
had been reported stolen in Redding. Parks spokesman Steve Capps said
that the ranger returned fire but that the gunman escaped. A short
time later, Capps said, the man abandoned the truck and stole an
older-model Mercedes at gunpoint, forcing the two women inside to
accompany him. He released the women unharmed in San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   David Melberg was arrested Wednesday by San Jose police, acting on
a tip. Police said they staked out a house where relatives of Melberg
lived and arrested him when he went out to get the morning paper.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a startling reminder of the dangers faced by our rangers
on a daily basis in patrolling the largest state park system in
America," Capps said.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Berry, chief of operations for state parks, said, "This
really points out that as society changes, we are getting the
spillage of the bad in society [at state parks], and we have to deal
with it."</TE>
<TE>   California park rangers began carrying weapons in the 1960s and
started getting the same training as police in the '70s. Capps said
rangers have been involved in a number of shooting incidents, and
have been shot at. But this is the first time in memory that a ranger
has been hit by a gunshot, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Roy Stearns, a parks department spokesman, said Galligan's
shooting could force the department to change the way it patrols
parks. Because some parks are in such remote areas that help from
backup officers can be as much as an hour away, supervisors have long
warned field rangers to be cautious when approaching illegal campers.
But that may not be enough.</TE>
<TE>   "Typically, they ride alone," he said of rangers. Now, he expects
that the agency will at least "look at" the possibility of putting
two rangers in each unit.</TE>

<LD>An 18-year-old high school dropout with a history of violent crime
has been arrested in the killing of an 80-year-old jazz trombonist
who was the city's 100th homicide victim this year.</LD>

a corner in his electric wheelchair, he was kicked and punched. The
killer fled with about $80.</LD>

<HD>Christian Filmmakers Strive to Guide Surfers to the Faith</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Lobdell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Using top surfers as evangelists, Christian filmmakers are showing a
surf movie this month in cities along the California coast in an
effort to use tube rides and testimonies about Jesus to attract
wave-riders to the faith.</LD>
<LD>   "The Outsiders" has attracted full houses at recent showings in
the San Diego County beach towns of Encinitas and La Jolla, its
producers say.</LD>
<LD>   It will be screened tonight at 7 at Edwards Big Newport theater in
Newport Beach. Additional showings are planned for Santa Monica,
Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz, and San Francisco.</LD>
<TE>   Producers of the 45-minute video say the surf community makes for
a fertile field for Christian missions because surfers -- however
dissolute their lifestyle on land -- have been exposed to
spirituality in the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   "They are interacting with God's creation and are really
introspective about how this came to be. This is power that had to be
created," said Jesse Schluntz, the video's director, editor and
occasional cameraman, who also delivered pizzas during the shooting
to help make ends meet. He's currently working in a Christmas tree
lot in San Diego County.</TE>
<TE>   Schluntz said the surf video, which cost about $20,000 to make, is
the perfect vehicle to deliver a Christian message to surfers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not wearing gold suits and gold rings and saying 'Send me
your money,' " Schluntz said. "We're just saying that if you're
looking for something else in your life besides surfing, partying and
trying to get girls, here are some guys who are content spiritually."</TE>
<TE>   At first glance, "The Outsiders" looks like any other surf video:
big waves, cutting-edge surfing, big-name talent, and hard-driving
music (though all Christian-based). But there are some usual elements
missing: no shots of shapely girls in thong bikinis, no cursing, and
no drinking, smoking or drugs.</TE>
<TE>   And other features are added: Christian testimonies from top
surfers, including current world champion C.J. Hobgood. Bits and
pieces of Scripture. And a scene in which surfers build a house for a
poor family in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the Christian wave-riders said they grew weary of the
worldly lifestyle, and they wonder about the damage they had done to
young admirers.</TE>
<TE>   "What seed did I plant in the grommets' heads?" said Paul "Sarge"
Sargeant, a well-known surf photographer, referring to beginning
surfers. "I wonder how many grommets I led astray. That's pretty
heavy."</TE>
<TE>   "The Outsiders" is the third video from Walking on Water, a small
Carlsbad-based ministry headed by former professional surfer Bryan
Jennings.</TE>
<TE>   "Changes," its second surf movie, has sold 60,000 copies, has been
shown internationally and translated into Japanese and Spanish since
it debuted in 2000, Jennings said.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the surf videos have real negative messages," Jennings
said of his decision to produce videos. "Kids see pictures of
half-naked girls, their heroes swearing, partying, doing drugs. I got
sick of talking about it."</TE>
<TE>   Schluntz, who became a Christian three years ago after a severe
depression, had a similar motivation. He reviewed videos for Surfer
magazine, and found the messages in most of them disturbing.</TE>
<TE>   "They're just really bad examples for kids," said the 25-year-old
video maker.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of each screening, organizers perform an "altar call,"
asking people in the audience to accept Jesus as their savior.
Jennings estimates that 25% of those who watched "Changes" came
forward.</TE>
<TE>   "We say, 'Here are our lives, here's what's going on,' " Jennings
said. "Now it's up to you."</TE>
<GT></GT>
<CP>PHOTO: SPECIAL MINISTRY: Bryan Jennings, left, and Jesse
Schluntz say their video, "The Outsiders," is a way to counteract the
messages wave-riders have witnessed in other surf videos. It has the
big surf, but not the bikinis, cursing and drugs, they say.</CP>

<HD>Trustees to Learn From Violations of the Brown Act</HD>
<DH>College board to take classes on open-meeting law after
D.A. said it acted illegally several times in its handling of
Chancellor Westin case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amanda Covarrubias</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County's community college trustees have pledged to uphold
the state's open-meeting law after the district attorney chided them
for failing to comply with the Brown Act.</LD>
<LD>   The five-member board, including two new trustees, unanimously
approved a resolution Tuesday evening, promising to study the Brown
Act and reaffirming its commitment to the law that governs all public
panels in California.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County Dist. Atty. Greg Totten recently asked the board to
pass the resolution after finding trustees violated the law several
times in handling the employment contract of former Chancellor Philip
Westin.</LD>
<TE>   "I think we're just reaffirming we're going to be extra vigilant
on the Brown Act and make sure we get proper training," said newly
named board President Art Hernandez. "There's different ways to
interpret the Brown Act. After the board members get trained, I think
our inclination will be to interpret it in the strictest sense."</TE>
<TE>   The two-page resolution calls for trustees and some staff members
to receive training every two years on the law that sets rules for
when a public board may meet behind closed doors.</TE>
<TE>   The board scheduled a retreat Jan. 24 to review the law and
discuss other district business.</TE>
<TE>   Special Assistant Dist. Atty. Tom Harris attended the board
meeting Tuesday night to witness the resolution's passage. Totten
told trustees in a Nov. 29 letter that he would not seek civil
litigation against the board if it formally reaffirmed its commitment
to the Brown Act.</TE>
<TE>   Totten found the board had unintentionally violated the law
several times since spring, when it awarded Westin a 16% salary
increase to $203,000 a year. The most recent violation occurred in
October, when trustees failed to notify the public in a timely manner

for allegedly abusing his expense account.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement -- which will pay Westin more than $200,000 in
salary, lifetime benefits and the title of chancellor emeritus for
one year -- became legal Oct. 4, but the public was not told about it
until Oct. 22.</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two people were killed and at least two others wounded Wednesday
evening in a shooting in an unincorporated area of Athens, sheriff's
deputies and witnesses said.</LD>
<LD>   About 7:30 p.m., three men got out of a car in the 600 block of
East 136th Street and approached the victims, all in their 20s.
Witnesses said all three men had guns, but the witnesses didn't know
how many fired the weapons. Deputies also could not say.</LD>
<LD>   Joaquin Hillman was walking from his grandmother's driveway to a
friend's house nearby when he was shot in the face. A second man, who
was getting out of his car nearby, also was shot. Hillman died at the
scene and the second man died at a hospital.</LD>
<TE>   A woman who was in the yard of Hillman's grandmother's house was
shot and wounded. It wasn't clear where the other wounded victim was
when the attack occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Hillman's uncle, Donald Hillman, said his nephew worked at an auto
dealership and "was a good kid with a future. He just picked the
wrong time to walk out of the house."</TE>
<TE>   The killers got away. Deputies, who were still interviewing
witness late Wednesday night on the cordoned-off block, said they
didn't know the motive for the shootings.</TE>

<HD>Street Racing Suspected in Death</HD>
<DH>Santa Paula grandfather driving home from church is killed
when a teen who witnesses say was speeding rams his pickup from
behind.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Chawkins</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It had been a happy occasion.</LD>
<LD>   The Zermeno family was delighted to see their youngest grandchild
in a Christmas program at a Ventura church.</LD>
<LD>   But 65-year-old Jose Zermeno never made it home. He was killed
Tuesday night when a teen who allegedly was drag-racing slammed into
Zermeno's red pickup on California 126.</LD>
<TE>   Genaro Mejia, 18, of Santa Paula, whose car hit Zermeno's, was
treated for minor injuries at Santa Paula Memorial Hospital and
released.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the California Highway Patrol said Wednesday that
no arrests have been made pending a full investigation.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Zermeno's widow, Delfina, a third-grade teacher in
Oxnard, grieved at home. One of his three grown daughters, also named
Delfina Zermeno, couldn't help but see a sad irony in her father's
death.</TE>
<TE>   "He was such a slow driver," she said. "He was like Mr. Perfect.
He just couldn't break the law."</TE>
<TE>   Zermeno had left the church in his pickup a few minutes before
family members followed him back to his Santa Paula home in another
vehicle. Slowly passing the accident scene just west of Briggs Road,
they realized with horror that the victim was Jose.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no one like him around anymore," his daughter said
through her tears. "He was the most honest person you could ever
meet."</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses told officers that Mejia and a 16-year-old passenger
appeared to be racing another car on California 118 through Saticoy,
occasionally crossing double yellow lines. Merging onto California
126, the two allegedly continued racing until Mejia's 1999 black
Chevy Malibu hit the rear of Zermeno's pickup, according to the CHP.</TE>
<TE>   Zermeno's truck veered off the freeway and hit a tree. He was
pronounced dead at the scene. Mejia smashed into a guardrail on the
center divider.</TE>
<TE>   The driver of the other car, described as a dark-colored Honda
sedan with tinted windows and customized wheel rims, fled. He is
being sought by police.</TE>
<TE>   A resident of Santa Paula for about 40 years, Zermeno for years
was a disc jockey and later was a sales manager at a car dealership.
Most recently he was a custodian for the Santa Paula Elementary
School District.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, though, he poured himself into activities with relatives,
particularly his four young grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   "His family was his world," his daughter said.</TE>

<HD>Valley Man Convicted of Killing His Son, 4, in Fire</HD>
<DH>Prosecutors said he did not want to pay child support. Jury
also finds him guilty of trying to burn to death the boy's mother.</DH>

<LD>Duane West did not want to pay child support. His anger led him last
summer to kill his 4-year-old son in a fire at the Granada Hills
townhouse where the boy lived with his mother, a jury concluded
Wednesday after five days of deliberation.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles Superior Court jurors convicted West, 30, of
first-degree murder in the July 9, 2001, death of Marquise Diantae
McDonald, who suffered third-degree burns to 73% of his body.</LD>
<LD>   Also, the seven-woman, five-man panel found the Winnetka resident
guilty of child abuse, arson causing bodily injury and first-degree
burglary as well as attempted murder and torture of the boy's mother,
Jaquetta "Nicole" Taylor.</LD>
<TE>   "What you have here is a man ... who killed a young boy because he
did not want to pay child support," Deputy Dist. Atty. Craig Mitchell
said after the verdict. "Nicole Taylor was asking for a grand sum of
$150 a month. [West] had paid in the entire lifetime of Marquise
$300."</TE>
<TE>   West -- a husband and father of two other children -- faces life
in prison without parole when Judge Lance Ito sentences him Jan. 24.</TE>
<TE>   The jury deadlocked on the special circumstance allegation that
West committed the killing for financial gain. Mitchell, who works in
the district attorney's Family Violence Unit, said he will not retry
that portion of the complaint. The jury acquitted West, the son of a
Louisiana minister, of a torture count involving his son.</TE>
<TE>   "This was obviously a difficult case from many points of view,"
Ito told jurors Wednesday as he thanked them for their service. "This
was as serious as cases come.... It was not pleasant."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Ilona Peltyn had argued her client was
"unraveling" over Taylor's demands for money and had committed the
crimes in an act of passionate rage.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, the boy's mother tearfully recalled how West had
blocked Marquise's escape from a burning bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   She testified that West -- a friend with whom Taylor said she had
a one-night stand -- set her on fire the same night her son was
killed by dousing her with nail-polish remover and lighting a match.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor said she is grateful to the jury.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact still remains that Marquise is dead," she said through
tears. "And that's something I have to live with for the rest of my
life."</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Samuel West Jr., father of the defendant, told reporters
that his family mourns the grandson they never knew.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just hurting on one side," he said. "It's hurting on
both sides.... It's still hard for me to believe Duane has done
something like this."</TE>
<TE>   As the verdicts were read, the defendant dropped his head into his
hands.</TE>

<HD>World Series Title Comes With a Price</HD>
<DH>Angels raise cost of tickets next season, with some games
costing more than others.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels are following their greatest season in history with their
greatest ticket-price increase in history, raising the average ticket
price above $20 and slapping a $5 surcharge on admission to the most
attractive games next season.</LD>
<LD>   The price hike reflects the cost of success and the newfound
popularity of the World Series champions. Disney has approved a
payroll boost to a record $84 million so that the Angels could keep
the core of their roster intact, and the company expects fans to pay
their share.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't want a Florida Marlins situation, where you win a world
championship and then you dismantle the team," said Kevin Uhlich, the
Angels' senior vice president of business operations. "That's not
what we want. That's not what our fans want."</LD>
<TE>   The Angels lost $17 million last season, Uhlich said, not counting
postseason revenue of $6 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have folded the playoff revenue into next season's
budget, coupling it with projected revenue from the increased ticket
prices in the hope of keeping the 2003 losses in the $14-$15-million
range.</TE>
<TE>   "If we did nothing, we would have been looking at a $34-million
loss," Uhlich said.</TE>
<TE>   In what Uhlich called "a test for us," the Angels joined the
growing number of major league teams charging higher prices for the
most attractive games. Outside baseball, the concept of adjusting
prices to consumer demand is nothing new -- a Saturday evening show
costs more than a matinee, a UCLA football ticket costs more against
USC than against Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   In the major leagues, the San Francisco Giants charge more for
weekend games, and the St. Louis Cardinals charge more for summer
games. The Angels opted to add $5 to ticket prices of 20 of their 81
home games, including opening day, some Friday night fireworks shows
and series against the Dodgers, New York Mets and New York Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels will not apply the surcharge to outfield seats or to
season-ticket sales, so a Yankee fan or Dodger fan could pay more
than an Angel fan for a ticket in the same section.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really about the person who will come to a game once a year
to see the Yankees play," Uhlich said. "It's supply and demand."</TE>
<TE>   Although the surcharge applies to selected games, the increased
ticket prices apply to all games, with per-game hikes of $1 in the
outfield seats, $2 in most of the upper deck and $4 in the field and
terrace levels and the best of the upper-deck seats. While discounts
are available to season-ticket holders, single-game prices for adults
range from $9 to $32.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers' single-game prices next season range from $6 to $25.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' average ticket price will rise from $16.88 to $21.15,
under major league accounting figures provided by the team. The
Dodgers' average ticket price was $22.40 last season; the average
major league ticket cost $21.28.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't want to lead the pack. We didn't want to be in the
upper third of the pack," Uhlich said. "We just wanted to be
average."</TE>
<TE>   Disney is banking on the Angels' wave of popularity translating to
financial support that can offset the $20-million payroll jump. Fans
bought 150,000 copies of the World Series highlight video during its
first weekend on sale, Uhlich said.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels sold 13,400 season tickets last year and have received
deposits for 4,700 more next season, he said.</TE>
<TE>   If the Angels match last season's attendance of 2.3 million, the
price increase would generate $5.8 million, Uhlich said. If they
reach their projection of 2.7 million, the price increase would
account for more than half of the payroll increase.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Lucas, the Angels' director of broadcasting, said he has
encouraged KCAL-TV Channel 9 to exercise an option in its contract
that allows the station to broadcast 50 games instead of the current
40. That would generate an additional $800,000 for the Angels, he
said, and help satisfy fan demand for additional broadcasts.</TE>
<TE>   Parking will not cost more next season, Uhlich said, but
concessions probably will.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the Angels can sustain a payroll that ranks among the top
10 in the majors is a question Disney would prefer to leave to new
owners. Disney remains committed to selling the team, with the hope
of selecting a new owner next spring and letting that owner make the
choice of slashing payroll, finding revenue sources that Disney could
not or simply subsidizing millions in losses every year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Price You Pay</TE>
<TE>   The Angels will include a $5 surcharge on tickets to 20 games next
season. The surcharge will not apply to season tickets or to seats in
the outfield pavilions. The games, selected because tickets are
expected to be in high demand on those dates, include several against
marquee opponents and several with postgame fireworks shows.</TE>

<HD>Selig-Rose Talks Make Feller Mad</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Commissioner Bud Selig's discussions with Pete Rose regarding
reinstatement has angered one former Hall of Famer.</LD>
<LD>   Reinstatement would make Rose eligible for the Hall of Fame, and
that mere possibility angered Hall member Bob Feller, who has been
vocal in his opposition to ending the ban.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a publicity stunt by him and his people," Feller said
Wednesday. "I'm tired of talking about it. I'm fed up. He's history."</LD>
<TE>   Feller was among a group of Hall of Famers who threatened to walk
out of ceremonies at Cooperstown in 2000 if Reds' broadcaster Marty
Brennaman had used his induction speech to campaign for Rose.
Brennaman made a brief but impassioned plea on Rose's behalf, but the
group of veterans remained.</TE>
<TE>   Yankee Manager Joe Torre said Wednesday night that Rose should
admit his mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly hope he can get together with Bud Selig and work this
out," Torre said. "He belongs in baseball. He has too much to offer.
He's such a great PR person for the game."</TE>
<TE>   Reinstating Rose is only one of the initiatives Selig is
considering, according to the baseball officials. He is thinking of
having the league that wins the All-Star game gain home-field
advantage for that year's World Series, moving one World Series game
per year to daytime, and moving the start of the World Series from a
Saturday to a Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore pitcher Scott Erickson has a torn labrum in his right
shoulder and will undergo rehabilitation. Erickson, the Orioles'
opening-day starter last season, is expected to be ready in time for
spring training.... Catcher Greg Myers and the Toronto Blue Jays
agreed to an $800,000, one-year contract. Myers, 35, hit .222 with
six homers and 21 RBI in 65 games with Oakland last season....
Shortstop Royce Clayton and the Milwaukee Brewers agreed to a
one-year contract that guarantees him $1.75 million, with a club
option for 2004. The Chicago White Sox released him in September
after he batted .251 with seven homers and 35 RBIs in 112 games....
The Chicago Cubs signed catcher Damian Miller to a two-year,
$5.7-million deal.... Outfielder Jose Guillen agreed to a $500,000,
one-year contract with the Cincinnati Reds, avoiding salary
arbitration.</TE>

<LD>The New York Times initially spiked two columns that dissented from
its editorial stand that Tiger Woods should boycott the Masters.</LD>
<LD>   Don Graham, the chairman of the Washington Post Co., which owns
the Washington Post, was quoted by the Washingtonian magazine as
telling sports editor George Solomon: "I have to remember to tell
[Post sports columnist] Mike Wilbon not to disagree with our
editorial policy on Iraq."</LD>
<LD>   In good hands: Arizona tight end Justin Levasseur allegedly had 87
pounds of marijuana in his truck. Wrote Tom Fitzgerald of the San
Francisco Chronicle: "This gives a whole new meaning to the term
'possession receiver.' "</LD>
<TE>   Reader Doug Kelly of Sacramento suggested to the Chronicle that
perhaps Levasseur was going to use the money to buy out the contract
of much-maligned Arizona Coach John Mackovic.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Three Iowa Hawkeyes have finished second in Heisman
Trophy voting. Who were they?</TE>
<TE>   Shotgun start: "Smith &amp; Wesson announced plans to produce golf
clubs," the Seattle Times' Dwight Perry writes, "giving a whole new
meaning to the question, 'What did you shoot?' "</TE>
<TE>   Comedian Alan Ray told the Chronicle: "The company is confident it
can compete in this market. Its products usually complete 18 holes in
just seconds."</TE>
<TE>   No sugar, please: "Quarterbacks are like tea bags," Missouri Coach
Gary Pinkel told the Kansas City Star. "You don't know what you've
got until you put them in hot water."</TE>
<TE>   Image problem: Jay Leno, on Tonya Harding's proposed appearance on
the undercard of the Mike Tyson-Clifford Etienne fight Feb. 22: "I
hate to see the image of boxing hurt by the sleaze of women's figure
skating."</TE>
<TE>   Generosity helps: New York Giant rookie tight end Jeremy Shockey
is getting all kinds of endorsement deals. Are his teammates jealous?</TE>
<TE>   "Every time they give me stuff, I give it to all my teammates,"
Shockey told the Bergen Record. "So they don't really complain to
me."</TE>
<TE>   Keen observation: ABC sideline reporter Lynn Swann said Miami
"wants to force Virginia Tech into a lot of third-and-longs."</TE>
<TE>   Wrote Phil Mushnick of the New York Post: "Fascinating. That's ...
been every team's defensive strategy since 1912."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Alex Karras (1957), Randy Duncan (1958) and Chuck
Long (1985).</TE>
<TE>   Big shoes to fill: Aisha Tyler, the comedian who played Shaquille
O'Neal's girlfriend on an episode of HBO's "Curb Your Enthusiasm,"
said she picked up one of his shoes to see just how big it is.</TE>
<TE>   "It reached from my kneecap to my hipbone," she said.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: HBO sent out a list of memorable quotes culled from
its sports shows this year. Here's what O'Neal, appearing on "On the
Record," told Bob Costas in April about his relationship with Phil
Jackson:</TE>
<TE>   "He's President Bush and I'm Dick Cheney. We may have some heated
arguments, but he's the boss and I'm the vice president."</TE>
<TE>   And Kobe Bryant?</TE>
<TE>   "He's next in line," O'Neal said.</TE>

<HD>Council Rejects Chargers' Request</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>

<LD>The San Diego Chargers, rebuffed by the city council in an attempt to
begin new stadium talks, are close to exercising the escape clause in
their Qualcomm Stadium lease.</LD>
<LD>   "We're sitting down to evaluate everything," Charger consultant
Mark Fabiani said Wednesday. "I can't say it's a fait accompli, but
when you work for seven months and the other party won't talk, it
does not leave you with many alternatives."</LD>
<LD>   He added: "When people refuse to even talk, it causes you to
wonder how committed [they] are to maintaining a relationship."</LD>
<TE>   In a 5-4 vote Tuesday, the city council rejected an offer by the
Chargers to conduct private talks with city officials about ending
the current lease, which runs through 2020 and includes two highly
controversial elements: a ticket guarantee and a renegotiation
clause.</TE>
<TE>   The chosen alternative is for a specially appointed task force to
handle the discussions, but that 15-member group is not expected to
file its initial report until mid-February -- exceeding the team's
60-day triggering window, which began Dec. 1.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to roll over for any sports team," said Brian
Maienschein, one of five council members to vote against beginning
talks.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers have informed San Diego Mayor Dick Murphy they are
willing to do away with the current lease and sign a two-year deal to
stay where they are. That would clear the way to put a new stadium
and development of the Qualcomm site on the November 2004 ballot. The
caveat to that deal, though, is the city cannot throw up any legal
roadblocks if the Chargers wanted to leave after the 2004 season.</TE>

<LD>USC offensive coordinator Norm Chow on Wednesday won the Broyles
Award, which is presented annually to the nation's top assistant
coach.</LD>
<LD>   And Chow, who attended a dinner and award presentation in Little
Rock, Ark., said he intends to remain an assistant under Coach Pete
Carroll with the Trojans.</LD>
<LD>   Chow was regarded as a candidate to replace Ron McBride at Utah,
his alma mater, but Urban Meyer of Bowling Green accepted the Utah
job on Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   Chow's name also surfaced Wednesday for the job at Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   "I have not heard from Kentucky, nor do I think I will," Chow
said. "I just want to stay at USC and see what happens from there."</TE>
<TE>   Chow said he and his wife were moved by the ovation he received
Monday night during the team's annual awards banquet. A capacity
crowd in the ballroom at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel erupted in
applause and gave Chow a prolonged ovation when he was introduced.</TE>
<TE>   "That was enough for my wife and I to say we're not leaving," Chow
said. "We want to be Trojans. I want to work for Pete Carroll and
help him win a national championship."</TE>

<LD>SAN ANTONIO -- Michael Olowokandi is eligible to come off the injured
list when the Clippers play Friday against the San Antonio Spurs.
Lamar Odom looks as if he's ready to play again, although the team
says he won't be activated until Dec. 28, which should be about the
time that Corey Maggette is healthy again.</LD>
<LD>   How the Clippers make room for three of their best players has yet
to be determined. Rest assured, the team is eager to get them back on
the floor.</LD>
<LD>   Olowokandi sat out five games because of tendinitis in his left
knee. Odom hasn't played since Jan. 28 because of wrist and ankle
sprains. Maggette underwent arthroscopic knee surgery Nov. 29.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know what we're going to do," Coach Alvin Gentry said
about the anticipated roster juggling when all three players are fit.
"We've got a couple of days before we have to make a decision."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers have several options, although you can rule out an
immediate trade, Because of the salary cap and concerns about the
luxury tax, trades are difficult to complete.</TE>
<TE>   Most likely, three Clipper reserves will come down with sudden
ailments that will force the team to place them on the injured list
to make room for Olowokandi, Odom and Maggette.</TE>
<TE>   It's also possible, although less likely, that Eric Piatkowski
will need to go on the injured list Friday because of a strained hip
flexor suffered in the first quarter of Tuesday's game against the
Dallas Mavericks. The team's medical staff will make a decision on
Piatkowski's status after today's practice.</TE>
<TE>   Teams can carry 12 players on their active roster, with a maximum
of three players on the injured list.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers did not practice Wednesday in keeping with Gentry's
policy of taking a day off after playing on consecutive nights. The
Clippers' 122-95 loss Tuesday to the Dallas Mavericks came one night
after their 94-90 victory at New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Point guard Andre Miller has had a badly sprained left ankle since
running into Sacramento's Bobby Jackson during the Clippers' loss
Nov. 29 to the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   He played only 31 minutes Tuesday against Dallas and later had
both ankles soaking in an ice bucket in the locker room.</TE>

<TE>   Where: At newsstands, beginning Monday</TE>
<TE>   Guess who's coming to town as Santa Claus? None other than
Shaquille O'Neal. He's not only coming to town, he's going national.
O'Neal, dressed in a specially made Santa suit, is on the cover of
all editions of next week's TV Guide.</TE>
<TE>   The magazine's editors chose O'Neal to be featured in their
special "Best of the Year" edition, and once O'Neal agreed, there was
a 24-hour window to get it done. The seamstress who produced the
Santa suit for the 7-foot-1 Laker center did it in a rush job.</TE>
<TE>   But O'Neal liked the suit so much he asked to keep it. So if you
see him in a Santa suit, you know where he got it.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal did the photo shoot on Nov. 23, the night after he came off
the injured list to play against the Chicago Bulls. At the shoot,
Rick Fox jumped up in Santa's lap. There are photos of that, but not
in the magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "We're saving those for blackmail purposes," quipped a TV Guide
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   In the magazine is a story titled "The Real O'Neal," by David
Hochman. In the lead, O'Neal explains he does all his Christmas
shopping in one night at an FAO Schwartz: "They let me come in after
midnight and basically buy out the store."</TE>

<HD>Vishnevski Takes No Offense</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Midway through the first period against Washington on Wednesday
night, Mighty Duck defenseman Vitaly Vishnevski was robbed of his
first goal of the season by Capital goaltender Sebastien Charpentier,
who made a diving save on Vishnevski's shot from outside the left
post.</LD>
<LD>   For Vishnevski, missing out on a goal is nothing new, considering
he has scored only twice in 211 NHL games. Vishnevski's game is
playing responsible hockey on the defensive end and he has been doing
that very well under first-year Coach Mike Babcock.</LD>
<LD>   "It's been a good season for me, I like playing this style of
hockey," said Vishnevski, who was drafted out of Russia with the
fifth overall pick by Anaheim in 1998.</LD>
<TE>   "We all know what we have to do in order to win games.... Quick
hockey, where everything is fast and done with speed. That's the
key."</TE>
<TE>   After slacking off some last season, Vishnevski is back to
delivering bone-crunching hits.</TE>
<TE>   But it's the rest of his game that has picked up the most.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter whether I'm hitting people or not but if I'm
playing hard and [the hits] come, that's good," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't play looking to hit somebody else. But hockey is a
physical sport. I just try and play within the system."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Ruslan Salei sat out for the sixth time in seven games
because of a back strain.</TE>

<HD>Shutouts Are Stacking Up for Giguere</HD>
<DH>Duck goalie holds opponent scoreless for second consecutive
game in a 3-0 victory over Washington.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Life with the Mighty Ducks has never been better than it was
Wednesday night in a 3-0 victory over the Washington Capitals in
front of an announced crowd of 11,006 at the Arrowhead Pond.</LD>
<LD>   Fredrik Olausson scored the game-winning goal in his 1,000th NHL
game. Mike Leclerc played his first game since November. Adam Oates
picked up an assist against a franchise for which he played 385 games
and goaltender Jean-Sebastien Giguere recorded his second consecutive
shutout.</LD>
<LD>   "This was a good win for our team, we're playing pretty well,"
said Olausson, whose team moved six points behind the Dallas Stars
for first place in the Pacific Division.</LD>
<TE>   Anaheim not only received a goal from Olausson but also a
second-period goal by defenseman Pavel Trnka and a empty-net goal by
forward Andy McDonald.</TE>
<TE>   Giguere, who has recorded three shutouts in his last 16 games and
has 11 in his career, has not given up a goal since late in the
second period against Chicago last Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "Our guys really did a good job in front of him," Duck Coach Mike
Babcock said about Giguere, who blanked Nashville on Sunday. "But he
was really solid."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks completely controlled a struggling Washington team,
which has played below .500 for most of the season and recently was
criticized by owner Ted Leonis for a poor work ethic.</TE>
<TE>   Giguere, who extended his shutout streak to 140 minutes, 15
seconds, finished with 26 saves against the Capitals, who were
scoreless in seven power-play opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   "We did a great job on the [penalty kill] against one of the best
teams in the league on the [power play]," said Giguere, who
registered the second set of back-to-back shutouts of his career.The
first also came against Nashville and Washington, last season.</TE>
<TE>   "They have great skill up front with Jaromir Jagr, Peter Bondra
and Robert Lang.... You have to be patient when you play them and
know where everyone is in the zone. I love those types of
challenges."</TE>
<TE>   It's only fitting that the first goal of the game was scored by
Olausson, who became the 63rd defenseman to play in 1,000 NHL games.</TE>
<TE>   With the Ducks on a power play late in the opening period, Leclerc
had the puck behind the Washington goal before delivering a pass to
Olausson, who was open at the right circle.</TE>
<TE>   From there Olausson scored his second goal in as many games to
give Anaheim a 1-0 lead at 16:24.</TE>
<TE>   "The team has been playing fairly well and I'm very happy with the
guys," said Olausson, the sixth defenseman born outside North America
to reach the 1,000-game milestone.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks' second goal came on the type of play that always seemed
to go against them in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Just before he reached the center red line, Trnka attempted to
send the puck into the Washington zone off the left sideboards.
That's when things got a little quirky.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of the puck bouncing harmlessly down the ice, it
ricocheted off the wall directly into the Capital net, which was left
open by Sebastien Charpentier, who had moved to his right in
expectation of the puck coming down the ice in a different direction.
The result was a goal for Trnka and a 2-0 lead 5:52 into the second

<TE>*--*
Rk  School (Rec.)                Comment
1   MIAMI  (12-0)                Players think it is possible not to
                                 overlook next opponent and have
                                 championship rings fitted
2   OHIO STATE  (13-0)           Only chance Buckeyes have in Phoenix
                                 is if one of the Insight Bowl teams
                                 shows up by accident
3   IOWA  (11-1)                 Hawkeye caravan, halfway to
                                 California, receives Western Union
                                 cable to turn wagons and head for
                                 Florida
4   GEORGIA  (11-1)              Sugar Bowl bills Bowden vs. Richt as
                                 "The Game the Orange Bowl Stuck Us
                                 With."
5   USC  (10-2)                  Trojan ticket packages to Miami
                                 include free ride to Bermuda
                                 Triangle on Jimmy Johnson's yacht
6   WASHINGTON STATE (10-2)      State rejects Jason Gesser's
                                 workman's compensation injury claim
                                 after going over UCLA game stats
7   KANSAS STATE  (10-2)         Holiday Bowl did the world a favor
                                 by not sending new UCLA coach to
                                 this potential train wreck
8   OKLAHOMA  (11-2)             Big battle brewing as to whether
                                 Rose Bowl will let the Sooner
                                 Schooner loose on historic turf
9   TEXAS  (10-2)                This couldn't have worked out
                                 better; a trip to the Cotton Bowl
                                 that doesn't involve playing
                                 Oklahoma
10  PENN STATE  (9-3)            Don't let anyone fool you about the
                                 Capital One Bowl. It's the Citrus
                                 Bowl with a new name
11  NOTRE DAME  (10-2)           Irish lawyers trying to figure out

                                 Mouse bowl in Jacksonville
12  MICHIGAN  (9-3)              Outback Bowl is OK, but players say
                                 top goal is winning Big Ten and
                                 going to Sony PlayStation Bowl
13  ALABAMA  (10-3)              You don't really want to know what
                                 Tide fans are doing to Dennis
                                 Franchione bobble head dolls
14  FLORIDA STATE  (9-4)         Bobby Bowden's New Year's Eve plans
                                 in New Orleans include a warm glass
                                 of milk and 10 p.m. bedtime story
15  WEST VIRGINIA  (9-3)         Memo to coach upset that Notre Dame
                                 gets preferential bowl treatment;
                                 wake up and smell the Irish coffee
16  COLORADO  (9-4)              Barnett thinks by the time Alamo
                                 Bowl rolls around he'll have a
                                 tailback healthy enough to put on
                                 his socks
17  AUBURN  (8-4)                Again, Rankman wants to make clear,
                                 trip to Capital One Bowl is actually
                                 trip to the Citrus Bowl
18  NORTH CAROLINA STATE (10-3)  Pairing with Notre Dame in Gator
                                 Bowl, is one of those bowl matchups
                                 you, yawn, dream about
19  BOISE STATE  (11-1)          If coach ends up with UCLA job, Ed
                                 Kezirian says he will be happy to
                                 lead team in Humanitarian Bowl
20  MARYLAND  (10-3)             When you add it up, Peach Bowl
                                 matchup against Tennessee equals two
                                 teams with seven losses
21  ARKANSAS  (9-4)              Music City officials tell fans they
                                 will not be allowed to do Hog calls
                                 on stage of Grand Old Opry
22  FLORIDA  (8-4)               Zook says media ban worked so well
                                 against FSU he might try it again
                                 during bowl week
23  PITTSBURGH  (8-4)            Players looking forward to playing
                                 Dec. 26 Insight Bowl just as soon as
                                 they return Christmas gifts
24  COLORADO STATE  (10-3)       Hey, the way things are going in the
                                 BCS, Rams could end up in the Rose
                                 Bowl next year
25  VIRGINIA TECH  (9-4)         Coach tells recruit this week "You
                                 heard it right, we scored 45 points
                                 against Miami."</TE>

<HD>This Party Is Missing Gesser of Honor</HD>

<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five players received invitations to Saturday's Heisman Trophy
ceremony in New York and Washington State quarterback Jason Gesser
was not one of them.</LD>
<LD>   The knocks against Gesser, apparently, are:</LD>
<LD>   * He went 10-2 for the No. 7 team in the nation.</LD>
<TE>   * He beat UCLA last Saturday to clinch a Rose Bowl bid playing on
a right ankle so badly sprained he could hardly walk. He had to take
painkillers to take the edge off. Mike Price, his coach, pulled him
out of the game at one point and Gesser just about flipped.</TE>
<TE>   "I was [ticked] off," Gesser said. "I told him 'I'm fine.' "</TE>
<TE>   Gesser limped back to the huddle, his ankle encased in a
prosthetic brace, then finished the game with 247 passing yards, two
touchdowns and a red rose clenched between his teeth.</TE>
<TE>   Had Gesser pulled this stunt while playing quarterback at Notre
Dame, the film of his life story would be in pre-production.</TE>
<TE>   After the UCLA game, Price called Gesser "a legend" and said he
would go down as the most beloved player to wear a Cougar uniform,
more beloved than Drew Bledsoe.</TE>
<TE>   "Even with Bledsoe, people got upset with him from time to time,"
Price said.</TE>
<TE>   What else has Gesser done to not deserve an invitation from the
Downtown Athletic Club?</TE>
<TE>   * His team won the Pacific 10 conference title.</TE>
<TE>   * He shared Pac-10 MVP honors with Carson Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   * He finished fifth nationally in pass efficiency, one spot ahead
of Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   * He threw 27 touchdowns to Palmer's 32, and 3,169 yards to
Palmer's 3,639. He attempted 90 fewer passes.</TE>
<TE>   * His team defeated USC, which boasts the quarterback, Palmer, who
may end up winning the Heisman.</TE>
<TE>   * Gesser lost one game on Sept. 14, at Ohio State, a school
playing for the national title after defeating 12 other teams.</TE>
<TE>   Gesser's other defeat?</TE>
<TE>   Well, no, actually you can't hang that one on him. Washington
State was ahead of Washington in the Apple Cup when Gesser got hurt.
After he left the game, Washington rallied to win in triple overtime.</TE>
<TE>   This turnabout, in the minds of Heisman voters, actually counts
against Gesser.</TE>
<TE>   There was talk earlier this year of an East Coast bias against
Palmer, but there has never been such a thing. The nation caught wind
of Palmer just as soon as he shook off two early losses and quit
throwing interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   USC is the one football school west of Denver people know about.
It pains an East Coast writer little to scrawl "X" on a Heisman
ballot next to a man from USC.</TE>
<TE>   While it's true the Trojans haven't had a Heisman Trophy winner
since 1981, they do have four trophies in their case. In fact, only
Notre Dame (seven) and Ohio State (six) have had more winners.</TE>
<TE>   If there is an East Coast bias it's a bias against Gesser,
Washington State, schools that can be reached only by access roads
and ones that don't have enough sugar daddy donors to fund Heisman
Trophy campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Gesser is not going to New York because the Heisman is about
clout, geography, tradition, ESPN, money and pedigree, and Pullman is
about as far removed from those things as you can get and still have
roaming cell phone access.</TE>
<TE>   No one is saying Gesser deserves to win the Heisman over Palmer,
Willis McGahee, Brad Banks, Ken Dorsey or Larry Johnson, but he
earned the right to get on a plane, knot his black tie and have Chris
Fowler say nice things said about him.</TE>
<TE>   Truth is, Heisman voters gave Gesser one cursory glance, that road
game against Ohio State, then wrote him off even though his team held
the lead, 7-6, at the half and even though Gesser could not, in the
second half, play defense against Buckeye tailback Maurice Clarett.</TE>
<TE>   That, in a nut, is the difference between playing quarterback at
Washington State and Notre Dame or Miami or USC.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, the record books will note that it was the senior Gesser, not
the senior Palmer, who led his team to the Rose Bowl in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Too Close to Call</TE>
<TE>   Carson Palmer wins the Heisman!</TE>
<TE>   Relax, it was only one survey, but Denver's Rocky Mountain News
has for the last 16 seasons conducted a weekly Heisman poll of 10
national college football writers, and this week's final tally had
Palmer claiming the Heisman by a narrow margin over Miami tailback
McGahee.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer received 39 points to McGahee's 38, followed by Iowa
quarterback Banks, Miami quarterback Dorsey and Penn State tailback
Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   If the newspaper's survey is any indication, the awarding of the
68th Heisman Trophy in New York on Saturday could be as tight as a
Florida election.</TE>
<TE>   The closest Heisman race was 1985, when Auburn's Bo Jackson beat
Iowa's Chuck Long by 45 points. Last year, Nebraska quarterback Eric
Crouch edged Florida quarterback Rex Grossman by only 72 points in a
race marred by the fact only 63.3% of the ballots were returned as
compared to 80% most years.</TE>
<TE>   For what it's worth, the Rocky Mountain News survey has correctly
predicted the Heisman winner 13 of 15 times.</TE>
<TE>   If Palmer does win the award, he might want to thank the Miami
coaching staff, which may have eliminated both Hurricane candidates
with a bonehead goal-line call last weekend against Virginia Tech.</TE>
<TE>   With the obvious intent of getting Dorsey some Heisman love, at
the expense of teammate McGahee, who already had scored six
touchdowns, Miami sent in backup tailback Jarrett Payton with
instructions to take a handoff and heave a toss-back pass to Dorsey.</TE>
<TE>   This, we presume, was intended to be a reenactment of last year,
when Crouch punctuated his Heisman push with a game-winning catch
against Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, though, Payton's intended pass for Dorsey was
intercepted and returned 96 yards for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "We went brain dead," Miami Coach Larry Coker said of the call.</TE>
<TE>   What If?</TE>
<TE>   USC earned a guaranteed at-large major bowl bid by finishing No. 4
in the final bowl championship series standings, a scant 0.28 of a
point ahead of No. 5 Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   What if Iowa had jumped USC for the No. 4 spot?</TE>
<TE>   Believe it or not, Trojan fans, you could have been packing for
the Holiday Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The way things played out, the Orange Bowl still would have taken
Iowa with its first pick, leaving the Rose Bowl in a quandary.</TE>
<TE>   With USC no longer an automatic choice, the Rose Bowl's selection
choices would have been Oklahoma, Florida State, USC or ... Notre
Dame.</TE>
<TE>   It's only hindsight to say what might have happened, but we know
the Rose Bowl did not want a Washington State-USC rematch or it could
have made that game.</TE>
<TE>   For the good of the BCS and the Pac-10, the Rose could have taken
Oklahoma and passed USC on to the Sugar or Orange bowls.</TE>
<TE>   Or, the Rose Bowl could have taken Notre Dame and marketed the
Irish's first appearance in Pasadena since the 1925 game featuring
the last ride of the famed Four Horsemen.</TE>
<TE>   That move, however, would have knocked USC out of the BCS and into
the Holiday Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   We think, in the end, the Rose Bowl would have taken Oklahoma and
let the Pac-10 cash its $18-million check.</TE>
<TE>   We think.</TE>
<TE>   Hurry-Up Offense</TE>
<TE>   UCLA Athletic Director Dan Guerrero said his decision to fire Bob
Toledo was based in part on "an evaluation of the environment," as if
he had first consulted Greenpeace. Let's get this straight: Toledo
was fired because he lost four games in a row to USC, the last two of
which the Bruins didn't even put up a fight.</TE>
<TE>   "UCLA people expect to be competitive with USC and last two games
weren't competitive," former UCLA coach Terry Donahue said this week.
"That sent shockwaves through the UCLA community. You've got to beat
your rival enough times to keep your job. If you don't beat them,
you've got to play competitively with them. This would have never
happened if those last two games weren't as lopsided. Last year was a
shock, but this year it went even further."</TE>
<TE>   Donahue, one of UCLA's greatest coaches, actually lost his first
four games against USC, but recovered to post a 10-9-1 record in his
20 seasons as head coach.</TE>
<TE>   Donahue acknowledges he might not have survived in today's
win-or-get fired climate.</TE>
<TE>   "When football coaches' salaries began to increase, I think the
demand for performance went up exponentially," Donahue said. "Demands
on coaches began to change."</TE>
<TE>   How did Donahue survive 20 seasons at one institution? "It was
harder than it looked," he said. "Trust me."</TE>
<TE>   Seven years after he had to turn down the UCLA job, Washington
Coach Rick Neuheisel appears smitten with the possibility of
returning to Westwood. Of course, the timing couldn't have been worse
then or now. In 1995, Neuheisel had just finished his first year at
Colorado when the UCLA job opened and he felt he just couldn't bolt
Boulder that quickly. Remember, this was before Dennis Franchione
perfected the art form.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Neuheisel has a different set of problems. First, he's making
too much money after recently signing an extension through 2007 that
will pay him $1.8 million a year if he stays. It includes a
$1.5-million loan that he doesn't have to repay if he's the
Washington coach on Jan. 1, 2007 and a $600,000 buyout. That means it
would cost UCLA $2.1 million just to get him out of Seattle.
Neuheisel's second problem: NCAA sanctions levied against him in the
Colorado probation prohibit Neuheisel from recruiting on the road
through May 31, 2003.</TE>
<TE>   If UCLA is a school of balance and integrity, as it claims,
doesn't this make Neuheisel poison?</TE>
<TE>   If hotshot Boise State Coach Dan Hawkins ends up getting the UCLA
job, he'll have some explaining to do back home. Hawkins signed a new
five-year contract last weekend that will reportedly make him Idaho's
highest-paid state employee. "I have officially made my commitment to
Boise State," Hawkins told the Idaho Statesman.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the most recent coach at Alabama could tell you how
fast commitments sometimes change.</TE>

coast, with parents who doled out the proper ratio of affection and
discipline.</LD>
<LD>   Dobush's life has taken many turns. He grew up in an
economically-depressed, drug-infested part of Detroit, where his
father slept with a gun under the pillow.</LD>
<LD>   But as Dobush grew older, unsafe surroundings turned out to be the
smallest worry in his life. By the time he turned 13, both of his
parents had died in separate, saddening ways.</LD>
<TE>   Mira Costa coaches say the senior quarterback is the
hardest-working player they've seen.</TE>
<TE>   Dobush was almost 6 years old when his mother, Patricia, died of
kidney failure and pneumonia brought on by years of drug and alcohol
abuse. She was in the hospital for a week. Then she was gone. She was
29.</TE>
<TE>   Seven years later, Dobush was sharing a bed with his father,
Joseph, when he heard his father thrashing and twisting at 3 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard a gasp ... he couldn't breathe," Dobush said. "I rolled
out of bed, ran into the kitchen and called 911. I tried to flip him
over, get the [stuff] out of his mouth. I tried to give him mouth to
mouth. It didn't work."</TE>
<TE>   Dobush rode in the ambulance with his father to the hospital,
where Joseph Dobush was pronounced dead of heart failure at age 46.
Peter Dobush was one month from his 13th birthday. "It was tough to
go on," he said. "But I had to."</TE>
<TE>   It would have been even more difficult if not for Bill Slobodian,
who was Joseph Dobush's step-brother. Slobodian lived in Detroit with
his wife, Cheryl, when Dobush's father died, but Slobodian was in the
process of moving to Torrance for work-related reasons. He and his
wife had two sons and a daughter, but they didn't flinch at taking
Dobush with them.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted Peter to be in our family," said Slobodian, an
engineer. "We just felt he needed love."</TE>
<TE>   Dobush was quiet and shy, and sometimes acted inappropriately,
stealing or destroying the toys of the Slobodians' children.</TE>
<TE>   "We had our ups and downs in the beginning," Slobodian said. "It
took a while to understand each other."</TE>
<TE>   It didn't take long for Dobush to find something he was good at,
something enjoyable, something to take his mind off the new,
unfamiliar surroundings -- football.</TE>
<TE>   He excelled on the freshman team as a quarterback. He started a
varsity game as a sophomore, but even though the Mustangs won the
game, Dobush was demoted. Within a short time, he fell into a
depression.</TE>
<TE>   The Slobodians paid for Dobush to start seeing a psychiatrist
every week for almost a year. Dobush was diagnosed with reactive
attachment disorder, which is usually associated with a child who
didn't have enough bonding time in early childhood with a parent.
Dobush still had to work through the deaths of his parents.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought all that stuff was behind me, but when I started
talking about it again I was in tears sometimes," Dobush said.
"Before I went into therapy, I could never be close to anybody. Ever
since [therapy], it's been much better. I'm willing to have
relationships and get close to people. It's made me a better person,
realizing what was wrong with me."</TE>
<TE>   Dobush's high school career ends Friday when the Mustangs (13-0)
play for the Southern Section Division III championship against
Sherman Oaks Notre Dame (13-0) at El Camino College.</TE>
<TE>   He is 26-1 as a starter, his lone loss coming against Newhall Hart
in last season's Division III semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   In September, in his most rewarding on-field moment, Dobush
pointed upward a few seconds after his fourth touchdown pass against
Downey Warren and said to the sky, "That's for you mom and dad."</TE>
<TE>   Dobush has one more wish before he throws his final pass for Mira
Costa.</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since my sophomore year, I've said we were going to go 14-0
and were going to win [Division III] as seniors," Dobush said. "I
don't want to let anybody down."</TE>

<LD>It's unlikely there will be a more emotional game played on Friday
than the one between top-seeded Corona Centennial (10-2) and
fourth-seeded and defending champion Riverside North (9-3) at
Riverside Norte Vista High.</LD>
<LD>   The Division V final is a rematch of last year's quarterfinal
game, won in an upset by North, 35-28. Centennial went into the game
top-seeded and unbeaten, including a 42-18 victory over North.</LD>
<LD>   "It's payback time to get the ring we didn't get last season,"
said linebacker Brett Martin. "We have to stay focused like it's
another game, even though we wanted to play these guys from the
get-go."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos (12-0-1) hasn't played in a title game since 1993,
when the Griffins completed a perfect season with a 39-21 victory
over Huntington Beach to win the Division II title. It was their
third in a row, though they shared the 1992 title with Anaheim
Esperanza.</TE>
<TE>   John Barnes, Los Alamitos' coach, is enthusiastic about his team's
opportunity against Santa Ana Mater Dei (10-3) on Saturday at Edison
Field for the Division I title because of one very big reason.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't been this healthy all year," Barnes said. "We had a
lot of injuries. Luckily, we had the depth to get through."</TE>
<TE>   Barnes said that among seven offensive linemen, only one played
all 13 weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The ironman was Chris Orozco, a 6-foot-4, 255-pound left tackle,
but perhaps the most valuable was Steve Snyder (5-11, 255).</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think [Snyder] would play much for us, but I thought he
would work hard and be a great program player for us," Barnes said.
"By the second game he was a starter and he ended up being All-Sunset
League."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Phelan Serrano advanced to its first section championship with a
37-36 triple overtime victory over Cathedral City. It's the first
time Serrano has been past the quarterfinals after losing in the
second round of the 16-team field for six consecutive years.</TE>
<TE>   One reason for Serrano's victory was the play of quarterback Jon
Edmiston, who completed 11 of 23 passes for 149 yards with no
interceptions. It's notable because the Diamondbacks rely heavily on
Chris Vega, who normally carries the ball 25-30 times per game.</TE>
<TE>   "The strength of our team is its running game, and the strength of
Kaiser is its defense," Serrano Coach Ray Maholchic said. "We'll have
to mix it up a little more than normal. We're kidding ourselves if we
think we'll run the ball down Kaiser's throat."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Division IV championship football game between Westlake
Village Westlake and Ventura St. Bonaventure will be played at 7:30
p.m. Friday at Moorpark High. The game had been originally scheduled
for Ventura High. Also, the site of the Division VII game between
Walnut and West Covina South Hills has been changed to Cal State
Fullerton. The 7:30 p.m. game Saturday had been scheduled for Covina
District Stadium.</TE>

<LD>Goaltender Danielle Dube became the third woman to start a
professional hockey game Wednesday night in the Ice Dogs' 4-1 loss to
San Diego before 1,633 at Long Beach Arena.</LD>
<LD>   Dube had 18 saves.</LD>
<LD>   Sylvai Deschatelets was alone in front of the net when he scored
on a backhand shot over Dube's glove 14:01 into the first period.</LD>
<TE>   Clayton Read scored on a breakaway 1:41 into the second period
after stealing a pass. Trevor Sherban added to the San Diego lead
when his shot inside the right faceoff circle got past Dube's pads.</TE>
<TE>   The Gulls made it 4-0 when Sandro Sbrocca beat Dube (0-1-0) high
on a two-on-one breakaway 5:05 into the final period.</TE>
<TE>   Tyler Johnston scored for Long Beach 13:32 into the third period.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second consecutive loss for Long Beach (11-10-0) after
a four-game winning streak. San Diego (10-10-1) has won two games in

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Heading into the final two weeks of the Hollywood Park fall meet,
Doug O'Neill and Bobby Frankel lead trainers with 10 victories
apiece.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neill, who has started 44 horses, will try to break the deadlock
this afternoon. He has three horses going. Frankel, who has had 39
starters, does not have an entry on today's card.</LD>
<LD>   In the fifth, a $43,000 optional claimer at 6 1/2 furlongs,
O'Neill will be represented by 7Flying Fugitive, the likely
pacesetter and the 7-2 second choice on the morning line. Flying
Fugitive has won two of six for owner David Lanzman and will be
ridden by Patrick Valenzuela. In the sixth, a $12,500 claimer at 1
1/16 miles, O'Neill's entrant is the veteran Manly Valentine. A
winner of 11 of 67, the 7-year-old Woodman gelding beat $10,000
claimers last month. Three of Manly Valentine's victories have come
at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<TE>   Then, in the eighth, a $32,000 maiden claimer for California breds
at 1 1/16 miles, O'Neill will start Blue Seti. Claimed by O'Neill for
$32,000 for a partnership on Oct. 17, Blue Seti will be trying for
the sixth time to break his maiden. He will break from the rail and
be ridden by Laffit Pincay Jr.</TE>
<TE>   In his first race for O'Neill, Blue Seti finished fourth, but was
only beaten a head and a nose for second.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The seventh at Hollywood Park, a wide-open turf
event for older California breds.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Eibar Coa. He's second in the Calder jockey standings,
winning about 26%.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Ryan Morris. The jockey started 2 for 66 at Golden Gate
Fields.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Mega Gift in the sixth,
using Passage To Ararat, Groom On The Run, Fantastic Groom and
Onetrickphoney in the seventh, and Blue Seti, Toomuchtrouble and
Kadesh N Shur in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/66. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $15/$381.20. Total money bet: $442.</TE>

<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>With rookies Alexander Frolov and Micheal Cammalleri playing
regularly for the Kings, how long will it be before the club calls on
Jared Aulin or Yanick Lehoux, the other young forwards they touted so
heavily last summer?</LD>
<LD>   Playing for the Kings' American Hockey League team at Manchester,
N.H., Aulin has 19 points in 25 games, Lehoux 14 in 24.</LD>
<LD>   "We're following that pretty good," Coach Andy Murray said.
"You've got to be careful that you don't have too many young guys all
at once. You don't want to send a signal to your team that, 'They're
going with all the young guys here; I don't fit into their plans.' We
don't want guys to think that.</LD>
<TE>   "Bryan Smolinski is in the last year of his contract and I'd like
him to think that we want him here. Play good and you'll create that
situation for yourself."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, though, continue to search for secondary scoring. Brad
Chartrand, who hasn't scored a goal since Oct. 12, has been scratched
from the last three games. Steve Heinze, who hasn't scored a goal
since Jan. 15 and started the season in the minors, has been
scratched from the last two.</TE>
<TE>   "You can only have so many guys in your lineup who aren't
generating any offense," Murray said. "We can switch one or two guys
and we're the same."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Derek Armstrong, a surprise for the Kings with 10 points in 19
games, sat out Wednesday night's game against the Dallas Stars
because of a groin injury. Brad Norton took his place, while
Chartrand and Heinze continued to sit.</TE>
<TE>   "Against the Stars, we felt we might want a bigger guy," Murray
said of the 6-foot-4, 235-pound Norton. "They've got a lot of big
defensemen."</TE>

<HD>Kings Have That Star Quality</HD>
<DH>Deadmarsh, Allison and Palffy each score a goal, and Storr
stops 35 shots in 3-0 victory at Dallas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>The Dallas Stars might be the top team in the Western Conference, a
leading contender for the Stanley Cup, but the Kings seem to have
their number.</LD>
<LD>   It's zero.</LD>
<LD>   As in the number of goals they've scored in two games against the
Kings this season, the latest a 3-0 King victory Wednesday night in
front of a lustily booing, early departing crowd of 18,532 at the
American Airlines Center.</LD>
<TE>   Including a 3-0 victory April 8 at Staples Center, which preceded
a 2-0 victory Nov. 23 at Staples Center, that's three shutouts in a
row for the Kings over the Stars, who haven't scored against the
Kings since Brendan Morrow netted an overtime goal March 6 at Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Felix Potvin turned in the first two but Jamie Storr was the human
wall in front of the net this time, turning aside 35 shots for his
first shutout of the season, among them a third-period breakaway by
Star scoring leader Mike Modano.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second shutout in two nights for the Kings, after
Potvin's 3-0 victory Tuesday night over the Nashville Predators, and
each member of the Kings' top line of Jason Allison, Adam Deadmarsh
and Ziggy Palffy scored a goal.</TE>
<TE>   For the Stars, it added up to their first regulation loss in 19
home games since March 24, including a 10-0-2-1 start this season.</TE>
<TE>   Their No. 1 goaltender, Marty Turco, was the NHL leader in
goals-against average and save percentage, but he was pulled by Coach
Dave Tippett in the second period after giving up three goals in the
Kings' first seven shots. Meanwhile, Storr stopped everything that
was thrown at him.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't ask any more from a guy who plays once every two or
three weeks," defenseman Mathieu Schneider said. "He really stole the
show tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Storr, making only his fifth start, said it was an honor to play
against the Stars, who when not playing the Kings are the most
prolific team in the West, having scored 98 goals in 28 games against
the rest of the league.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be a No. 1 goalie in this league and to be a No. 1
goalie I think you have to play against the best teams and be
successful," he said. "A lot of backups don't have the opportunity to
play against the better teams.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just thankful I did."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings were outshot, 35-18, but they needed only one to score
the only goal they needed, Deadmarsh netting his 12th of the season
-- and third in three games -- on a shot from the right point at 6
minutes 43 seconds of the first period.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the second, Allison scored from in front off a pretty
cross-ice pass from Deadmarsh, his first goal since returning to the
lineup last Thursday after sitting out 15 games because of a right
knee injury.</TE>
<TE>   Less than seven minutes later, Palffy scored from the high slot
off a pass from Allison, who, like Palffy, figured in all three
goals.</TE>
<TE>   Because of injuries, the line of Allison, Deadmarsh and Palffy has
been intact for only six of the Kings' 28 games but has accounted for
26 points, 11 by Allison and 10 by Palffy. The breakdown: 11 goals
and 15 assists.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's a better line in hockey," Schneider said.
"Those guys just dominate when they're out there."</TE>
<TE>   And when the Kings get strong goaltending, they dominate too.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if you can ever get a handle on [the Stars]," King
Coach Andy Murray said. "But if we get all our bodies back, we're not
a bad team ourselves."</TE>

<LD>It is possible the Lakers could resume functioning well together if
after every loss they weren't strafed by one of their superstars.</LD>
<LD>   But they're the ones with the championships.</LD>
<LD>   "If it were me, I'd trade them both," Robert Horry said with a
laugh. "Send one to Memphis and one to Utah."</LD>
<TE>   As it was, they all reported to a previously unplanned practice
Wednesday morning in El Segundo that was scheduled right about the
time the Golden State Warriors scored the last of their 106 points in
Oakland on Tuesday night, dropping the Lakers to 9-14.</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal, who waved off reporters the night before --
"Talk to the [guys] that ain't doing nothing. Don't talk to me," he
said -- rode an exercise machine and Kobe Bryant had treatment for a
variety of ailments, a bruised right elbow the most recent.</TE>
<TE>   After a dreary film session, basketballs hit floor at noon, 14
hours after their 14th loss, a bit of a mess that bought them this
practice. Last year, they had 14 losses on Valentine's Day, and it
didn't look particularly good then, either.</TE>
<TE>   They were only percentage points ahead of last-place Golden State
in the Pacific Division, with yet another Eastern swing -- their
third already -- looming next week after they play New Orleans on
Friday and Orlando on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Phil Jackson said he was encouraged by parts of the loss to
the Warriors, which didn't explain the practice but did clarify his
breezy view of things.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all right," Jackson said. "How many times do I have to tell
you guys it's going to be until the holidays before we can tell about
this team?"</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, O'Neal, who entertained reporters and teammates in the
weeks of his rehabilitation from toe surgery with humorous stories
and other bouts of cleverness, is hardly the same guy anymore.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal's recent roast of teammates hardly registered in their
locker room, but then, after a late flight and an early report time,
it's possible few saw the papers. While O'Neal and Bryant have been
critical of their supporting players and it has led to speculation
about roster change, a trade seems unlikely, given the Lakers'
proximity to the salary cap (way over) and the luxury tax (slightly
over).</TE>
<TE>   "That's a management decision," Horry said. "If they want
something fresh, that's their prerogative. And if the two big dogs
want something fresh, that's their prerogative too."</TE>
<TE>   The fact is, Horry said, O'Neal and Bryant have had their moments
of "doing nothing" -- O'Neal's words -- too, so maybe it's time for
everyone to get on with things, a sentiment shared by Brian Shaw.</TE>
<TE>   "For three years, these are the same guys who've gone to war with
Kobe and Shaq," Shaw said. "To say that now we're not doing our
parts, I don't think that's right."</TE>
<TE>   Shaw said he remembered standing on the championship podiums as a
group, though he noted it was O'Neal and Bryant who held aloft the
trophies.</TE>
<TE>   "We lose as a team too," Shaw insisted.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, if O'Neal is truly unhappy, Shaw figured he'd get it
first-hand.</TE>
<TE>   "If he has something to say, he's man enough to come say it to our
faces," he said. "When he says it to you guys, and you bring it to
us, it doesn't mean anything. There'll be a lot of things that go on
until we right the ship. This is one of those things."</TE>

<HD>Parker Scores 32 to Sink Mavericks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tony Parker picked the right night to nearly triple his usual scoring
output.</LD>
<LD>   The San Antonio point guard scored a career-high 32 points,
including seven free throws in the final minute, to lead the Spurs to
an 111-104 victory over division rival Dallas on Wednesday night at
San Antonio.</LD>
<LD>   The loss was only the third in 22 games for the Mavericks, who
played without leading scorer and rebounder Dirk Nowitzki (sprained
ankle).</LD>
<TE>   Parker's performance helped the Spurs hold off a fourth-quarter
Dallas charge led by Michael Finley, who made four three-point
baskets in the quarter -- the final one pulling the Mavericks to
within 97-92 with about three minutes left.</TE>
<TE>   "We were not shooting well and had some turnovers [in recent
games], but tonight we stayed together and turned it all around,"
Parker said. "That was key."</TE>
<TE>   Finley scored 17 points in the fourth quarter and finished with
36, nearly double his season average.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 92, Philadelphia 88 -- Brent Barry made a three-point
basket and Gary Payton made two free throws in the last 23 seconds,
and the SuperSonics rallied to end the 76ers' 10-game home winning
streak.</TE>
<TE>   Payton and Rashard Lewis each scored 20 points, and Barry had 18.</TE>
<TE>   Allen Iverson had 26 points for the 76ers, who were nine for 34
from the field in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 103, Boston 94 -- Shawn Marion had 32 points and 11
rebounds, and the Suns won on the road for the second time this
season.</TE>
<TE>   Antoine Walker tied a season high of 31 points for Boston. Paul
Pierce was injured on a hard foul and was held to 16 points.</TE>
<TE>   Marion scored four points in a 6-0 run that turned an 86-85 lead
into a seven-point advantage with 2:44 left.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 105, Portland 104 -- Jason Kidd had 27 points and 12
assists and the Nets continued to make East Rutherford, N.J., an
unkind place for their opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Jefferson had 22 points and career highs of 15 rebounds
and seven assists to help the Nets win their sixth in a row at home
and 11 of 12.</TE>
<TE>   Ruben Patterson scored a season-high 26 points for Portland, which
had a three-game winning streak ended.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 126, Milwaukee 119 -- Jermaine O'Neal matched his season
high with 30 points, including four in overtime, and Reggie Miller
scored 20 to help the Pacers beat the Bucks for the first time in
five games at the Bradley Center.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana had lost three of its previous four on a six-game trip in
which Miller went scoreless at Utah, scored 10 points at Seattle, 12
at Phoenix and was held scoreless at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 91, Atlanta 80 -- Richard Hamilton scored a season-high 32
points to lead the Pistons at Auburn Hills, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   The Hawks, who got 21 points from Shareef Abdur-Rahim and 15 from
Jason Terry, have lost five in a row on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 96, Toronto 83 -- Rookie Dajuan Wagner scored a
career-high 33 points to lift the Cavaliers at home.</TE>
<TE>   Wagner scored 14 points in the third quarter, when Cleveland took
control, turning a 46-44 deficit into a 74-67 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Voshon Lenard scored 24 points to lead Toronto, which lost for the
fourth time in five games.</TE>
<TE>   Memphis 96, Denver 93 -- Jason Williams scored five of his 16
points in the last 36 seconds to lead the Grizzlies at Memphis, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' three-pointer with 35.2 seconds left tied the score,
93-93. His two free throws 10 seconds later gave Memphis the lead for
good, 95-93.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orlando Magic released forward-center Horace Grant on Wednesday
because the 15-year veteran struggled to recover from off-season knee
surgery.</LD>
<LD>   Grant, 37, played only five games this season for the Magic. He
missed 17 games because of a sore left knee and one game because of
back spasms. Grant averaged 5.2 points, 1.6 rebounds and 17 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   Grant had surgery on his left knee Sept. 13.</LD>
<TE>   "Horace has had a great run," Magic Coach Doc Rivers said. "His
body just won't let him do the things he used to."</TE>
<TE>   Grant, who had said this would be his final season, did not
respond to phone calls. He is free to sign with another team.</TE>
<TE>   Grant, who signed with Orlando in July 2001, averaged eight points
and 6.3 rebounds last season.</TE>
<TE>   In his career with Chicago, Orlando, Seattle and the Lakers, Grant
averaged 11.5 points and 8.3 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   An All-Star in 1994, Grant was on three championship teams with
the Bulls and one with the Lakers.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Seattle's OneWorld Challenge benefited from a penalty imposed on
Prada of Italy, tying its America's Cup challenger semifinal series,
1-1, today off Auckland, New Zealand.</LD>
<LD>   In the other semifinal, Alinghi beat Oracle by 46 seconds to
extend its lead to 3-0 and move within one victory of the challenger
final.</LD>
<LD>   OneWorld tied its series with Prada when the Italian team was
penalized for sailing above its proper course at the second mark.</LD>
<TE>   Prada had gained the lead on its superior downwind speed when it
turned in a defensive maneuver approaching the leeward mark. Umpires
ruled the Italian team had to execute a penalty turn and, in doing
so, it handed OneWorld an unassailable lead.</TE>
<TE>   Alinghi moved out to a 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven semifinal
against the heavily funded San Francisco entry of software magnate
Larry Ellison.</TE>
<TE>   Alinghi helmsman Russell Coutts beat fellow New Zealander Chris
Dickson in the pre-start for a four-second advantage across the start
line.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle, with Dickson replacing Peter Holmberg at the wheel, took
the lead on the first beat and rounded the top mark nine seconds
ahead.</TE>
<TE>   It led around the first four marks.</TE>
<TE>   Alinghi regained the lead when the wind shifted in its favor on
the final beat, allowing it to sail past Oracle on the left side of
the course and extend its lead on the run home.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew they'd made a mode change overnight and were issued with
a new measuring certificate this morning," said Alinghi pitman Josh
Belsky. "So we knew they had something up their sleeve.</TE>
<TE>   "We were a bit surprised to see Chris Dickson on the helm. They
were able to get ahead of us on the first beat and they stayed ahead
for most of the race."</TE>
<TE>   Belsky said Oracle's tactics worked in Alinghi's favor.</TE>
<TE>   "Each time they shoved us out to the left we got a better shift,
something like two degrees each time," he said. "We got into a little
better pressure and eventually ... we were doing better over on the
left. But they certainly didn't lack boat speed."</TE>

<HD>Knee Injury Ends Season for Miller</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jim Miller's season of pain is over. The Chicago Bear quarterback
will not play in the last three games because of a sprained ligament
in his left knee.</LD>
<LD>   The injury won't require surgery but will leave him on crutches.
Miller suffered the injury in the third quarter of Chicago's 27-9
loss to Miami on Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Bothered by a sore shoulder and elbow that restricted his ability
to throw the ball, Miller has been fighting injuries for three
seasons. His injuries include a torn Achilles' tendon and problems
with his hip, side, ankle and hamstring.</LD>
<TE>   In the playoffs last January, he separated his throwing shoulder
when he was slammed to the ground during an interception return.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Chandler will replace Miller when the Bears play host to the
New York Jets on Sunday at Champaign, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Miller's injury is the latest for the Bears in a trying season.
The Bears have used more than 40 starters and have 10 players on
injured reserve.</TE>
<TE>   Miller finished the season with 180 completions in 314 attempts
for 1,944 yards and 13 touchdowns with nine interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The NFL has acknowledged its officiating crew made at least nine
mistakes during Sunday's Green Bay-Minnesota game, including a key
pass interference call, two newspapers reported.</TE>
<TE>   The mistakes were documented in a confidential memorandum, the
Star Tribune and St. Paul Pioneer Press said, citing unidentified
sources.</TE>
<TE>   The Vikings lost, 26-22. Eight of the plays in question occurred
in the fourth quarter, when the Packers made up a nine-point deficit
with two touchdowns. An interference call negated a Vikings'
interception on the Packers' game-winning drive.</TE>
<TE>   "Conversations between the NFL officiating department and teams
are confidential," league spokesman Michael Signora said. "We do not
comment on them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre apologized for making an obscene
gesture toward Minnesota's Chris Hovan after the Packers' victory.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the league said that the participants in the teams' postgame
melee about 50 yards from the Favre-Hovan exchange could expect fines
but not suspensions when punishment is meted out today.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With Matt Hasselbeck unable to practice, Jeff George worked out as
the No. 1 quarterback for the first time since signing with the
Seattle Seahawks on Oct. 29, and the 13-year veteran might play
Sunday at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Hasselbeck's status is uncertain because of a sprained left foot.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coach Mike Martz suggested for the first time that if Marc Bulger
continues to play as well as he has, he could compete with Kurt
Warner next season for St. Louis' quarterback job.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, absolutely," Martz said. "If Marc continues to grow and get
better with the success he's had, you can't ignore that kind of
success, and we certainly would not."</TE>
<TE>   Bulger has a 106.0 passer rating, which would lead the league if
he had enough attempts, and is 5-0 as a starter this year -- the
Rams' only victories. He returns to the lineup Sunday against Arizona
after recovering from a sprained finger. Bulger has 12 touchdown
passes and four interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After being sidelined by a shoulder injury for nearly three full
games, San Diego receiver Curtis Conway returned to practice and said
he'll start at Buffalo on Sunday.... Tampa Bay Pro Bowl safety John
Lynch did not practice because of a neck strain suffered against
Atlanta, and doesn't believe he'll be able to play Sunday against the
Detroit Lions.... Oakland beefed up its depleted secondary by signing
Tony Lukins, a cornerback who has been working as a telephone
operator the last two months. Lukins joined the practice squad....
Detroit running back James Stewart sat out practice because of neck
and toe injuries, and is questionable for the game against Tampa
Bay.... Cincinnati free safety Lamont Thompson had surgery for torn
knee cartilage and is out for the season.... The New York Giants
suspended injured receiver Ron Dixon for a game because he missed
treatments and a doctor's appointment for his sprained knee.... A
small fire broke out at Detroit's Ford Field, but there were no
injuries or damage.</TE>

<HD>Miller Enjoys Ride With Surging Irish</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The night of the NCAA title game last April, Dan Miller was driving
back to South Bend, Ind., after Easter break.</LD>
<LD>   In Atlanta, his former Maryland teammates were winning a national
championship.</LD>
<LD>   "I was calling back and forth, checking the score," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Miller was a onetime Maryland starter who transferred to Notre
Dame after reaching the Final Four in 2001, knowing full well the
Terrapins could go back the next year.</TE>
<TE>   They did, and won the title without him.</TE>
<TE>   "My basic reaction was that I was happy for all my friends there,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Miller -- known as Danny when he played at Maryland -- got a
measure of satisfaction Saturday when he scored 17 points as Notre
Dame upset the defending champions, one in a remarkable run of three
victories in eight days over top-15 teams.</TE>
<TE>   By beating Marquette, Maryland and then-No. 2 Texas, Notre Dame
(8-1) vaulted to No. 10 in the Associated Press poll, a small salve
for a campus still reeling over being bounced in football from the
bowl championship series to the Gator Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a great week for us," said Miller, who was taunted by some
Maryland fans at MCI Center in Washington, D.C., with "Where's your
ring?"</TE>
<TE>   Basically, he traded a ring for playing time.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew that team had a great chance to win the national
championship," Miller said. "In my opinion, we should have won it the
year before. We choked when we had the big lead." Maryland blew a
22-point lead to Duke in the 2001 semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   But after starting every game as a sophomore, Miller was a reserve
as a junior, and he decided to leave, Final Four prospects or not.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have loved to have been there for that game and the whole
month of March. I just didn't want to be there from October to
February," he said. "I weighed my position and I felt transferring
would be more positive."</TE>
<TE>   A 6-foot-8 senior forward with an outside shooting touch, Miller
is not Notre Dame's best player -- that would be point guard Chris
Thomas, with freshman forward Torin Francis next.</TE>
<TE>   But he is one element of a very efficient offense for the Irish,
whose loss was to No. 23 Creighton, a game Miller says helped spur
the team to improve.</TE>
<TE>   During last week's run against three solid defensive teams -- none
of them allowing more than 65 points a game -- Notre Dame scored 92,
79 and 98 points. The Irish are shooting almost 48%, including more
than 41% from three-point range.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have a lot of interchangeable parts in our offense,
and people who can do a lot of different things," Miller said. "We
can spread it out and open up the floor. That's what happened this
weekend, and Torin took advantage of it inside. We can spread it out
and isolate different players."</TE>
<TE>   It starts with Thomas, who had 32 points and 10 assists against
Marquette and held his own in a battle of premier point guards with
T.J. Ford of Texas with 19 points, six rebounds and eight assists.
Ford had 21, three and 12.</TE>
<TE>   When the three-point shooters spread the floor, Francis can take
advantage of space inside. He scored 20 against Maryland and 21
against Texas and has five double-doubles in his first nine college
games.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Miller is mindful of how much early-season victories mean.
Not much, if you don't back them up.</TE>
<TE>   Remember Ball State, which upset Kansas and UCLA last season --
eventual Final Four and Sweet 16 teams -- then failed to make the
NCAA tournament?</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're capable of being a really great team, but we have
to maintain it," Miller said. "We had a great week early. [But what
happened to Ball State] can happen to anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Evan Burns' Debut</TE>
<TE>   Whether he could have kept UCLA from a 1-2 start is doubtful, but
Evan Burns is easing into his college career at San Diego State after
failing to gain admission at UCLA, where he originally signed out of
Fairfax High.</TE>
<TE>   Burns chose San Diego State after UCLA -- which does not accept
partial qualifiers -- declined to admit him when the NCAA didn't
certify his high school transcript, questioning some required "core"
classes.</TE>
<TE>   Burns recently won an NCAA appeal, becoming eligible before
Saturday's game against Arizona, when he scored seven points off the
bench, and playing his second game Tuesday against Long Beach State,
when he contributed 10.</TE>
<TE>   Burns could have delayed enrolling in college and sought to win an
appeal to gain admission to UCLA, but chose to go ahead and enroll at
San Diego State.</TE>
<TE>   "That was my first choice, San Diego State," he said. "But after
meeting a few times with [Coach Steve] Lavin, I thought I'd stay
closer to home. That didn't work out, and that's why I'm at San Diego
State."</TE>
<TE>   Burns said he doesn't spend much time looking back, but he has
noticed the Bruins' start.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really know what's getting into those guys," he said.
"They've played a couple of games where it seemed like they were
thinking about something else. They'll get it together."</TE>
<TE>   A 6-8 forward, Burns is one of six players on Coach Steve Fisher's
team who initially signed with another Div. I school.</TE>
<TE>   The one who might prove to be the team's best -- Travis Hanour, an
Arizona transfer from Laguna Beach -- becomes eligible Saturday
against Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   Ducks Fly South</TE>
<TE>   There will be at least 17,000 fewer fans on hand Saturday night
for No. 5 Oregon's game at Pepperdine than there were for the Ducks'
revenge over Kansas on Saturday in Portland. (The crowd of 20,762 at
the Rose Garden was the largest ever to witness a college basketball
game in Oregon.)</TE>
<TE>   Think of it as a chance to see a top five team in the intimacy of
3,104-seat Firestone Fieldhouse, though Pepperdine's injury trouble
means it probably will be a far less competitive game than it once
appeared.</TE>
<TE>   The Kansas game was Ore- gon's vengeance for the 104-86 loss that
stopped the Ducks a step shy of the Final Four in the Midwest
Regional Final last season.</TE>
<TE>   Key statistics in Oregon's 84-78 victory Saturday: The Ducks held
Kansas to two fastbreak points, and lost the rebounding battle by
only six after being outrebounded by 29 in the NCAA tournament game.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, Kansas doesn't have Drew Gooden anymore, but Ore- gon
doesn't have Freddie Jones.</TE>
<TE>   The differences were the performances of Oregon forward Luke
Jackson and Kansas forward Nick Collison.</TE>
<TE>   Collison did in the Ducks last March with 25 points and 15
rebounds. This time, he was held to seven points and eight rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson was four for 16 last season and scored 10 points. This
time, he scored 26.</TE>
<TE>   Carey's Recovery</TE>
<TE>   Senque Carey, the New Mexico guard who started his career at
Washington, has made considerable progress since a spinal cord injury
left him partially paralyzed Nov. 25 when he fell to the floor after
taking a charge against Northwestern State.</TE>
<TE>   Carey left his wheelchair Sunday and took about 10 slow,
stiff-legged steps and shot some three-pointers, school officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our program is rejoicing at the fact that 'Q' is taking steps,"
Coach Ritchie McKay said. "It's an answer to the prayers of many. The
outcry of support for 'Q' and our program has been overwhelming."</TE>
<TE>   Carey regained some feeling for the first time Saturday and still
can move his legs only slightly, but is continuing physical therapy
about three hours a day. Doctors remain uncertain how much use he
will regain.</TE>
<TE>   Carey says he has not given up the possibility of playing again,
but he would require an extra year of eligibility from the NCAA to
return next season.</TE>

<HD>Otis Says Return 'Unbelievable'</HD>
<DH>Controversial coach addresses Dominguez players for first
time since rehiring but still faces civil suit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ben Bolch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The coach who turned Compton Dominguez High into a boys' basketball
powerhouse returned to familiar grounds Wednesday afternoon, and it
was just like old times. Hugs, handshakes, smiles all around.</LD>
<LD>   Russell Otis was enjoying the first day of his second chance. Less
than 14 hours after the Compton Unified School District board
approved his hiring in a hotly contested 4-3 vote, he briefly
addressed his players, including three holdovers from the Dons'
1999-2000 national champions -- his national champions.</LD>
<LD>   "It's just good to be back, to see the red and gold and black,"
Otis said, standing courtside. "It's an unbelievable feeling. The
faces have changed, but this is still Dominguez."</LD>
<TE>   He received a warm welcome from the players, who know the legend
if not the man.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy to be here and have him as a coach," said David
Nichols, a senior forward who greeted Otis with a wide smile. "I'm
going to work my hardest and play my heart out for him."</TE>
<TE>   Added Travon Free, the team's best player: "He said everything is
going to change back to the way it was. If you don't come out and
play hard, you won't be here or be starting."</TE>
<TE>   If only it were that easy.</TE>
<TE>   With Otis as coach for 13 seasons, from 1987-2000, the Dons won
seven Southern Section titles, four state championships and became
the toast of a much-maligned town.</TE>
<TE>   Sponsored by sports apparel king Nike, they wore top-of-the-line
shoes, warmups and uniforms, traveled the country to the best
tournaments and competed straight-up with the nation's best teams.</TE>
<TE>   Dominguez was a magnet for top players, including 7-foot Tyson
Chandler, the centerpiece of that national champion, who transferred
in because it was among the best basketball schools in Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   Chandler made the jump from Dominguez directly to the Chicago
Bulls. But before he left, he and the rest of the Dons celebrated
their end-of-the-season No. 1-in-the-nation ranking like
professionals, riding around Compton in stretch limousines and
receiving championship rings engraved with their names and uniform
numbers.</TE>
<TE>   That was in April 2000. Seven months later, the cheering suddenly
stopped when Otis was arrested and charged with sexually molesting a
former player.</TE>
<TE>   The allegations were made public in November 2000, and Otis was
placed on administrative leave just as the Dons were ready to start
defense of their national championship. By February, Otis was
officially gone -- ousted by the state-appointed leader of the
Compton schools before his trial had even started. The given reason:
He lacked a permanent teaching credential -- a detail that had never
before been an issue.</TE>
<TE>   Otis, 40, was acquitted of all charges, but that didn't get him
his job back. His request for reinstatement was denied. Last year, he
was a teacher at Gardena High; he didn't coach.</TE>
<TE>   And although he is back at Dominguez and has completed coursework
to get a teaching credential, still looming is a civil trial brought
by the same family who accused him in the criminal case.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Randy McMurray, that family's attorney, seemed
dumbfounded that Otis might be allowed to return to coaching. "I
would think the people in Compton would think protection of their
children is just as important as a winning basketball team," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Without Otis, Dominguez's basketball program quickly unraveled.</TE>
<TE>   Mack Calvin, who had college and NBA experience, was brought in as
coach before last season, but even he was unable to stem the tide of
defections among players loyal to Otis.</TE>
<TE>   The Dons made the playoffs but sputtered to a 15-12 finish, losing
more games than they had the previous three seasons combined.</TE>
<TE>   Calvin, citing other personal priorities, resigned in October,
about a month before the Dons were scheduled to open this season. The
father-son team of Horace and Joey Aubrey -- both former Dominguez
players -- took over the team on an interim basis, guiding the Dons
to a 2-2 start.</TE>
<TE>   Late Tuesday night, shortly after learning the Compton school
board had decided to bring him back, Otis was visibly relieved.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is one step toward getting back on track and getting
[my] life back in line," he said. "It's still kind of numbing because
it's been so long and you had to fight so hard for a job that's
yours."</TE>
<TE>   Basil Kimbrew, a longtime school board member with loyalties to
Otis, said the coach's return was possible because control of the
district was recently returned to the local board. For a time, the
decisions had been made by a state administrator given the assignment
of steadying a district beset by poor test scores and a $20-million
budget deficit.</TE>
<TE>   "We should have hired him a long time ago," said Kimbrew, who came
to the board meeting sporting a black warm-up jacket with "Dominguez:
#1 in the nation" printed in red across the back. "The minute he was
exonerated, he should have been here, period."</TE>
<TE>   In most Compton circles, Otis maintained his popularity, even
before his acquittal. But his support is far from unanimous.</TE>
<TE>   Board members Cloria L. Patillo, Emma Sharif and Erica P.
Quijada-Barrera voted against Otis' return. Patillo and Sharif
declined to comment on the vote and Quijada-Barrera left before the
meeting adjourned and did not return a phone message Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Randolph E. Ward, who was the state administrator in charge, is
now a trustee with veto power over school board decisions. He also
declined to comment, but he issued a statement following the vote
noting, in part, that "both the board and the state trustee will
closely monitor" Otis' work. Ward has the authority to overrule the
board's decision to rehire Otis at any time.</TE>
<TE>   Said Otis: "He can come to practice every day. I have nothing to
hide."</TE>
<TE>   Looming just as large over Otis is the civil suit, which includes
charges similar to those brought in the criminal complaint. The
Compton district is named as a co-defendant, accused of negligence. A
jury trial is scheduled to begin in early February.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney McMurray said school district officials made a mistake by
allowing Otis' return. "It would probably behoove the [school
district] to wait until a case like that is resolved before moving
forward," he said. "If he is found civilly liable, they would be in a
precarious position."</TE>
<TE>   Otis has filed a cross-complaint against the player and his
family, alleging they made "false police reports, lying and perjuring
themselves in the proceedings leading up to the said criminal jury
trial, and in the course of their testimony at the criminal jury
trial."</TE>
<TE>   In the criminal case, Otis was said to have lured the player to
his Carson townhouse where an alleged sexual encounter took place.
Another former player testified during the trial that Otis performed
oral sex on him and fondled him.</TE>
<TE>   But several jurors said the prosecution failed to prove that the
accuser was molested.</TE>
<TE>   Otis knows some people may never believe he is innocent. "I don't
try to justify or convince people," he said. "[But the school board
decision] goes a long way to show people I was innocent from Day 1."</TE>
<TE>   Otis has two weeks to prepare the Dons for their next game, Dec.
26 in the Torrey Pines National Prep Classic. Dominguez will play
Fairfax, No. 2 in The Times' rankings, in the kind of matchup that
made Otis famous.</TE>
<TE>   "All I want our kids to do is to be players," Otis said. "Work to
improve every single day. Their ego is kind of wounded right now. No
one's giving them a chance this season, and rightfully so. They
really haven't had a lot of time together playing.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we'll be all right, though."</TE>

<HD>Man Pleads Guilty to Schemes</HD>

<LD>Glen DaSilva, one of three men linked to the $3-million scam at the
Breeders' Cup pick six, pleaded guilty Wednesday to three federal
charges regarding other racetrack schemes that he and his former
college fraternity brothers had engineered.</LD>
<LD>   DaSilva, 29, faces reduced sentences totaling about two years
after he admitted guilt in conspiracies to commit wire fraud and
computer fraud and to launder money. The New York City resident will
be sentenced on March 11. He has been ordered to pay a $4,000 fine
and make restitution of $200,000, the approximate amount that he and
the two other former Drexel University students shared after a
wide-ranging plot that included making pick-six and pick-four bets
after some of the races had been run, and counterfeiting winning
tickets not cashed at five Eastern racetracks.</LD>
<LD>   Chris Harn, the dismissed Autotote employee who was the mastermind
of the schemes, changing bets and manufacturing tickets in his job as
a senior software engineer for the bet-processing company, has
already pleaded guilty and may face a six-year sentence. Another
former Drexel student, Derrick Davis of Baltimore, is expected to
plead guilty today. Harn's sentencing is scheduled for Feb. 15.</LD>
<TE>   DaSilva, who appeared Wednesday in a court in White Plains, N.Y.,
was not charged in connection with the Breeders' Cup pick-six bet,
which was not paid after an investigation showed that the winning
tickets had been altered after four of the six races were run. The
Breeders' Cup bet was made by Davis on a telephone account with an
off-track betting site in New York and was changed, to correspond
with the outcomes of the early races, by Harn, who appeared on his
day off at the Autotote offices in Newark, Del.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks before the Breeders' Cup, in early October, DaSilva
had an account at the same New York OTB as Davis, and Harn altered
tickets that resulted in a $1,757 pick-four payoff at Balmoral Park,
a harness track in suburban Chicago, and a $107,608 return on a pick
six at Belmont Park in Elmont, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Those bets have been described as dry runs for the Breeders' Cup.
The counterfeiting scheme, in which Harn entered the Autotote system
to pinpoint uncashed tickets and then re-created the tickets for
DaSilva and Davis to cash at the tracks, began in November 2001.
Court records show that Harn, working after hours, intercepted
payoffs due ticketholders who were either unaware they had won or who
had accidentally discarded their tickets. Harn's scheme took money
that belonged to thousands of bettors, in amounts ranging from
hundreds of dollars to the thousands.</TE>
<TE>   Records showed that DaSilva deposited $80,000 from his OTB account
into a bank account in New York. From the bank account, he paid
$25,000 on a mortgage on a Delaware home that belonged to Harn, and
also paid off a $6,500 loan on Harn's car.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys are amateurs," said Ed Hayes, DaSilva's attorney,
after his client entered his plea. Hayes has been critical of Harn
for making an early guilty plea that accelerated the prosecutors'
case.</TE>
<TE>   DaSilva, Harn and Davis have remained free after posting $200,000
personal bonds. Before the pick-six investigation began, DaSilva had
been on parole for possession of cocaine. When the three men first
appeared in court, in White Plains on Nov. 12, the U.S. attorney's
office said that DaSilva and Davis had tested positive for cocaine.</TE>

<DH>For whatever reason, Lakers don't look like champions and
they need some help in a hurry</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Now, you can worry.</LD>
<LD>   Now, after staring for a month and a half into the blackness of
what used to be a twinkling sky, you can wonder.</LD>
<LD>   Will that championship constellation known as the 2000-2002 Lakers
ever show up this season?</LD>
<TE>   As something more than an occasional brilliant flash?</TE>
<TE>   For longer than a few minutes?</TE>
<TE>   As Laker fans drop their heads back into their hands today, their
patience as short as Derek Fisher's jump shot, their worries as thick
as Shaquille O'Neal's waist, the answer is becoming clear.</TE>
<TE>   It is no.</TE>
<TE>   Without a change in both roster and attitude, it appears these
Lakers will not be good enough to win a fourth consecutive
championship.</TE>
<TE>   More than a quarter of the way into a season in which they have
lost 14 of 23 games, the answer comes not from panic or pessimism,
but from the Lakers themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Listen to O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   Although he has criticized teammates in the past, his words have
always been couched in trust and respect.</TE>
<TE>   After Tuesday's loss to Golden State, he ripped them behind their
backs for the second time in 11 games since his return. This time, on
the way to the bus. Ostertagging them with words that burned their
cheeks.</TE>
<TE>   "Talk to the [bleeps] that ain't doing nothing," he told
reporters. "Don't talk to me."</TE>
<TE>   While O'Neal needs to shut up now, his bosses also needed to hear
him. He is begging for them to make a trade. He is begging for a
shooter. He has never begged like this before.</TE>
<TE>   Listen to Robert Horry.</TE>
<TE>   He is the most easygoing player in the room, secure in his five
championships, annually shrugs off projections of doom, once blamed
the Lakers' cold starts on the ice underneath the Staples Center
floor.</TE>
<TE>   Until after Wednesday's workout, when he was asked about the
theory that three long playoff runs -- nearly an extra full season --
have finally buckled the veteran Lakers' knees.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, I looked at that, and I thought, yeah, last year we
were a step faster," he said. "You wonder, is it catching up to us?
You look at all the little injuries we've been having ... it's just
been weird."</TE>
<TE>   Now listen to Fisher.</TE>
<TE>   He is the most verbally inspirational guy on the team, always
plays hard, recovered from two foot surgeries without an excuse,
never blinks.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, for a brief moment, the stare wavered.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a tough thing we're trying to do," he acknowledged. "I
don't know if the gap between us and other teams has gotten smaller
or what. But I tell you, it's tough to slap guys in the face for four
years in a row. It's just tough."</TE>
<TE>   At this moment, the challenge is bigger than they are.</TE>
<TE>   Friday here against New Orleans, the Lakers begin a stretch of
seven games against teams that made the playoffs last season. Four of
those games are on the road. The final is the Christmas showdown here
against Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Not until then, Phil Jackson insists, can a true evaluation be
made.</TE>
<TE>   "How many times do I have to tell you guys, it will be until the
holidays that I know about this team," he said Wednesday, shaking his
head in frustration. "How many times do I have to tell you? I say it
every week. The holidays."</TE>
<TE>   Replied one reporter: "But you never said which  holiday."</TE>
<TE>   Chimed in another reporter: "We thought you meant Hanukkah."</TE>
<TE>   Turns out, he could have meant Halloween.</TE>
<TE>   With O'Neal out of the lineup because of September toe surgery,
with Kobe Bryant barking at the role players like O'Neal barks now,
what was true on opening night is still true today.</TE>
<TE>   Horry looks tired. Rick Fox looks distracted. Fisher looks slow.</TE>
<TE>   Devean George and Samaki Walker look like wastes of money.</TE>
<TE>   Newcomers Tracy Murray and Kareem Rush, well, we don't know how
they look, because they are playing only 16 minutes per night
combined.</TE>
<TE>   Even though everyone can still fit into that puzzle around O'Neal
-- witness Friday's astonishing comeback against Dallas -- they seem
too weathered and distracted to do it consistently.</TE>
<TE>   The Laker mystique still exists -- look at how mighty Dallas
choked -- but it is slowly being chipped away by the likes of
Cleveland, Miami and Golden State.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't always been bad, but what Shaq said was true," Horry
said. "At times, everyone on this team has been bad. All of us."</TE>
<TE>   That includes O'Neal, who needs to pipe down before somebody
realizes that he is ripping his teammates for a situation he caused.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, this year's problems started not on the bench, but in the
middle, last summer, with the guy who is supposed to solve them.</TE>
<TE>   This space will continue to defend O'Neal for delaying toe surgery
until he was confident in his doctors and his decision. He was
worried about his career. The wrong choice could have finished him.</TE>
<TE>   Having brought this town three championships on a bad toe, he
deserved the right to take his time and be certain about having it
fixed.</TE>
<TE>   But it is impossible to defend his decision not to remain in
better shape during rehabilitation.</TE>
<TE>   And the effect of an absent, then slow-starting O'Neal on his
teammates cannot be underestimated.</TE>
<TE>   "Having gone through surgery, I understand his concern," said
Fisher. "But hindsight being 20-20, sure, we wish he had the surgery
earlier. If he wanted to miss training camp, fine, he could have
worked that out with Phil and Mitch [Kupchak]. But it sure would have
been nice if the surgery were done in the summer."</TE>
<TE>   Now that he's back, to rip his teammates for lacking the rhythm
that he creates is a bit incongruous. And, for the self-proclaimed
team general, not too cool.</TE>
<TE>   "He's our leader, he can have his opinion," said Fisher. "But he
has to be careful not to pass the blame on other guys. When you
struggle, that's when you really need to stick together."</TE>
<TE>   Only one Laker needs to be yapping right now, and that is Kupchak,
on the phone, to other general managers, trying to figure out a way
to extricate his team from this mess.</TE>
<TE>   It's going to take another player, a shooter, fresh legs, new
attitude.</TE>
<TE>   Before each of the three championship years, the Lakers received
off-season help from an outside source, whether it was Phil Jackson,
Horace Grant or (at times) Samaki Walker.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, the two main acquisitions -- Murray and Rush -- have
been ignored by Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Giving the nine-time championship coach the benefit of his doubt,
Kupchak needs to find somebody else, even though the odds are against
it.</TE>
<TE>   Kupchak has problems with budget. He has problems trading players
who, because their individual games have long since disappeared into
the Laker triangle, have little value elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody wants to help the Lakers. The Lakers seem unable to help
anyone else. The situation seems impossible.</TE>
<TE>   Which was when Jerry West was at his best.</TE>

<HD>Time for Bruins to Enjoy the Life of Coach Riley</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The rumors are flying, interviews are being arranged and I can only
imagine how distressing this must be for the Towel Waver, who has
been appointed coach of the UCLA football team, and already there is
a move afoot to replace him.</LD>
<LD>   And some folks around here think Mike Garrett is fickle.</LD>
<LD>   Now it's too early to tell if UCLA's new athletic director, Dan
Guerrero, knows what he's doing, although you have to wonder about
someone who flew into New Orleans on the company expense account to
interview Saints' assistant coach Mike Riley, and didn't even stay
around long enough to walk from one end of Bourbon Street to the
other.</LD>
<TE>   And today he's going to Las Vegas, and while I know what you're
thinking -- he's going to hire John Robinson  -- he's really going to
the Las Vegas Bowl news conference to make sure a tough question
doesn't turn the Towel Waver into the Towel Snapper.</TE>
<TE>   Then he's going to leave town without even stopping first at one
of the sports books to take the six points and Iowa in the Orange
Bowl. Just think of the killing he could make -- maybe winning enough
money to hire a really good coach.</TE>
<TE>   This we do know, apparently after back-to-back visits to two of
the leading sin cities in this country, Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes is going
to remain all business, which gives us our first clue who won't be
UCLA's new coach. In fact there is no way he can even talk to the
Peck's Bad Boy of college football -- Rick Neuheisel.</TE>
<TE>   Now I think the world of Neuheisel, covering him as a football
player when he was with the Chargers and watching him blossom as a
head coach, but even though such folks as Terry Donahue are
supposedly dropping his name -- as if Neuheisel might really be
interested in taking a pay cut and returning to his alma mater --
Neuheisel's rap sheet won't allow it.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes fired Bob Toledo because the environment just
wasn't right, because members of the UCLA family and the media were
going to keep bringing up the problems of the past. So that also
dooms Neuheisel, who not only is trying to stay one step ahead of the
NCAA posse but has his own player peccadilloes now making news in
Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time Toledo was being fired because he couldn't
control his players, one of Washington's receivers was being booked
into jail for investigation of hit-and-run and reckless driving. No
word whether he was driving a loaner SUV.</TE>
<TE>   Enough about Neuheisel, who cannot even be considered for the UCLA
job, and on to who will get the job -- if the Bruins don't blow it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S HOTTEST name is Denver Broncos' wide receiver coach Karl
Dorrell, who apparently has a number of former Bruin football players
supporting him, which tells me a number of former Bruin football
players would like to have a voice in the program's future now that
old-timers Toledo and athletic director Peter Dalis are gone.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City Chiefs' defensive coordinator Greg Robinson, who was
born in L.A., worked at Pacific along with Pete Carroll and who
coached previously at Cal State Fullerton, comes across in the same
enthusiastic manner as Carroll and probably would be the first coach
in some time to teach the Bruins how to tackle.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Riley, meanwhile, has been the hottest coaching candidate in
the country the last two years after going 1-15 with the Chargers,
which shows you how impressed everyone was with his ability to win a
game in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Dorrell lacks experience, Robinson is short on Pac-10 expertise
and recent recruiting duty -- which obviously didn't impact Carroll,
but Riley provides all that and more, including Pac-10 head coaching
experience at Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   Riley's the right pick, if Alabama doesn't beat the Bruins to it,
or it's going to be time to wave the towel.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE MAXWELL Award will be presented tonight as part of The Home
Depot 2002 College Football Awards ceremony on ESPN, and the three
finalists for the award that is given to the best all-around player
are Iowa's Brad Banks, Miami's Ken Dorsey and Penn State's Larry
Johnson. The Heisman Trophy is going to be presented later in the
week to "the most outstanding player in college football," which by
Maxwell standards places USC's Carson Palmer no better than fourth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   BANKS, DORSEY, Johnson and Palmer were asked who they'd vote for
in the Heisman race if they couldn't vote for themselves. Dorsey and
Banks took Miami running back Willis McGahee, Johnson selected Banks
and Palmer named Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   I believe Palmer has the winner. I'd take Dorsey, because the most
outstanding player in college football has to be the guy who is 38-1
as a starter, and there's no mention in Heisman rules that the award
is based on only one year of work.</TE>
<TE>   I believe the two Miami players, Dorsey and McGahee, will cancel
each other's votes out with the same thing happening to Palmer and
Banks as voters wrestle to determine which quarterback is better.
That leaves Johnson sitting second on most ballots and accumulating
the most points for the win.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LOCATION AND timing won't allow it to happen, but it would have
been fun to be there for the opening of spring training when F.P.
Santangelo conducts his first news conference as the new manager of
the Class-A San Jose Giants.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Shawn Smith:</TE>
<TE>   "The only reason you criticized Guerrero's decision to fire Toledo
is because you are a SC homer. The Bruin faithful applaud Guerrero's
decision. Sorry SC and T.J., you do not get Toledo for another year."</TE>
<TE>   That's the last time I'm going to try to help SC.</TE>

<HD>Maradona Doctor Is Arrested</HD>

<LD>Diego Armando Maradona's former doctor, Hernando Mauricio Vergara,
was arrested trying to board a flight in Cali, Colombia, Wednesday
after authorities discovered four pounds of cocaine in his luggage.</LD>
<LD>   According to police, the drug was found in Vergara's computer bag
and camera case, but the doctor, who was detained before being able
to board a flight bound for Buenos Aires via Panama, said he did not
know how the cocaine had gotten there.</LD>
<LD>   Vergara gained international attention as the doctor who treated
Maradona, the former Argentine star whose career ended in ruins after
he twice received lengthy worldwide suspensions from FIFA when he
tested positive for drugs, including cocaine.</LD>
<TE>   Stewart to MLS?</TE>
<TE>   Earnie Stewart, a three-time World Cup player for the United
States and one of the national team's leaders in games played and
goals scored, will be free to join a Major League Soccer team in the
spring after being given the option to leave his Dutch club, NAC
Breda, without his new club having to pay a transfer fee.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, 33, has spent 14 years in the Dutch league but wants to
end his career in the U.S. and has said he would like to play in Los
Angeles. Salary cap issues might prevent the Galaxy from signing him,
however.</TE>
<TE>   Champions League</TE>
<TE>   Only four of the European Champions League's 16 teams remained
unbeaten and untied Wednesday as the league played its final five
games before taking a two-month winter break.</TE>
<TE>   The five matches -- whose combined attendance came to almost a
quarter of a million -- left only Barcelona, Manchester United, AC
Milan and Inter Milan with perfect records.</TE>
<TE>   Goals by Dani, Patrick Kluivert and Thiago Motta earned Barcelona
a 3-1 home victory over Newcastle United. The Catalan club's win was
its 10th in a row, equaling the Champions League record set by AC
Milan in the 1992-93 season.</TE>
<TE>   Manchester United shut out Deportivo La Coruna, 2-0, in front of
67,014 at Old Trafford. AC Milan also stayed perfect with a 1-0
victory over Borussia Dortmund in Germany, where Filippo Inzaghi
scored.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Real Madrid struggled to a 2-2 tie with
visiting Lokomotiv Moscow. Two goals by Raul saved the Spanish team
from defeat, but Real has not won in its last six Champions League
matches.</TE>
<TE>   Juventus had the easiest victory, routing FC Basel, 4-0, in Turin
behind goals by David Trezeguet, Paolo Montero, Alessio Tacchinardi
and Alessandro Del Piero.</TE>
<TE>   Champions League play resumes Feb. 18.</TE>
<TE>   A Long Haul</TE>
<TE>   South America's soccer confederation voted to retain its marathon
World Cup qualifying process, in which each of the continent's 10
countries play the other nine home and away over a three-year span.
As a result, qualifying for the Germany 2006 tournament will begin in
August.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican Semifinals</TE>
<TE>   Toluca took advantage of several errors by nervous Santos Laguna
goalkeeper Adrian Martinez Wednesday and rolled to 5-3 victory in the
first game of the two-game Mexican championship playoff semifinal
series at Estadio Corona in Torreon.</TE>
<TE>   Paraguayan striker Jose Cardozo scored twice for the Red Devils,
who also got goals from Vicente Sanchez, Maximiliano Cuberas and
Antonio Naelson Zinha.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Mexican soccer federation earlier had suspended
Santos Laguna Coach Luis Fernando Tena for two games, making it
impossible for him to lead his team in the series.</TE>
<TE>   Tena was banned after running onto the Azteca Stadium field to
protest a refereeing decision during Sunday's quarterfinal victory
over defending champion Club America.</TE>

<HD>Dorrell Is Hot Name of Day</HD>
<DH>UCLA's Guerrero will interview the former receiver and
current Bronco assistant. Riley gets Alabama offer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While Mike Riley is mulling over a coaching offer from Alabama and
wondering if UCLA will counter, Bruin Athletic Director Dan Guerrero
has widened his search to include another NFL assistant with
substantial support among boosters.</LD>
<LD>   Guerrero on Wednesday scheduled an interview with Denver Bronco
receivers coach Karl Dorrell, a former UCLA player and offensive
coordinator at Colorado and Washington, perhaps as soon as today.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, Kansas City Chief Coach Dick Vermeil, who coached
UCLA in 1974 and 1975, was in contact with Guerrero and spoke highly
of Chief defensive coordinator and former UCLA assistant Greg
Robinson.</LD>
<TE>   But Robinson -- as well as Washington Coach Rick Neuheisel and a
long list of prominent college coaches that includes current Bruin
defensive coordinator Phil Snow -- is taking a back seat for the time
being.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe it's a two-horse race -- Karl Dorrell and Mike Riley,"
said Tom Ramsey, a television analyst and former UCLA quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Riley, the New Orleans Saint secondary coach, met with Guerrero
and athletics administrator Bob Field on Tuesday in New Orleans, but
an offer was not made despite UCLA reserving a seat on the return
flight to Los Angeles in Riley's name.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero would not comment on the reason Riley was not made an
offer, but if UCLA wants the former San Diego Charger head coach and
USC assistant, quick action might be necessary.</TE>
<TE>   A prominent Alabama booster said Wednesday that Crimson Tide
Athletic Director Mal Moore told him an offer had been made to Riley,
a former Alabama player. Moore convened a team meeting, possibly
anticipating that he would announce Riley as coach, but was able to
tell the players only that the search had been narrowed to "two or
three names."</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't say anything," Alabama receiver Antonio Carter said.
"That was a waste of time."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA probably would not make Riley an offer at least until
interviewing Dorrell, which could force Riley into a choice of
accepting the Alabama offer or risk losing out on both jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Riley, who was 14-34 with the Chargers from 1999-2001, could not
be reached after reports of the Alabama offer surfaced. Earlier
Wednesday he said, "I'm really at peace with whatever happens."</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero has his own risks. Failing to make an offer to Riley
could prompt him to take the Alabama job, yet failing to interview
Dorrell, 39, would enrage the influential boosters who have bombarded
the athletic department with endorsements in recent days.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates describe Dorrell as one of the brightest lights in the
coaching landscape despite having been an assistant his entire
career.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Young, a former Bruin receiver who works in the Bronco
front office, and Homer Smith, a highly respected UCLA assistant for
13 years, are among his most avid supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "With regard to leadership, character and energy, you can't find a
better role model for kids than Karl Dorrell," Young said. "He is
extremely principled and comes in completely clean. And he's done
everything you need to do in a so-called apprenticeship working
toward becoming a head coach."</TE>
<TE>   Said Smith, who has remained in contact with Dorrell since
coaching him from 1982-86: "I recruited and coached Karl Dorrell from
start to finish. He was characterized by his error-free play. He may
never have made a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   "He certainly would handle players well. He is self-motivated as
so many great leaders are."</TE>
<TE>   Dorrell appreciates the backing and made it clear he is very
interested in becoming UCLA's 15th coach, even for the relatively low
salary of $700,000 that is believed to be Guerrero's starting point.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been a lot of supportive people who are calling me and
are recommending me," Dorrell said. "I'm very flattered.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the money issue will take care of itself. I'm not as
concerned about that as a lot of the candidates. My deal is wanting
the job and bringing the program back to where it should be."</TE>
<TE>   If hired, he would become only the fourth African American head
coach in Division I football.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Robinson, 51, expressed interest in the position, using
Vermeil as a mouthpiece. Robinson was the Bruin defensive line coach
during the time Dorrell was a player.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether they give him a great shot, I don't know," Vermeil said.
"He certainly knows what it is to coach at UCLA and the competition
between USC and UCLA. All I can say right now is that he's considered
a candidate."</TE>
<TE>   A source close to Robinson said that his only drawback besides not
having served as a head coach is an occasionally confrontational
style.</TE>
<TE>   "He's volatile," the source said. "He won't get along with
[college] players."</TE>
<TE>   Evaluating all this is the first-year Guerrero, whose closest
confidant is Field, a gentlemanly and loyal Bruin who was pushed from
his post as defensive coordinator into an administrative job two
years by Bob Toledo</TE>
<TE>   Now Toledo is gone, fired Monday after seven seasons. He has been
unreachable, even having his home phone number disconnected.</TE>
<TE>   Neuheisel reportedly is willing to take a pay cut to come to UCLA
and is trying to set up a meeting with Guerrero. But the athletic
director is busy courting Dorrell, who studied at Neuheisel's knee
for four years as his offensive coordinator at Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Bruin players who starred during the UCLA heyday of the 1980s felt
marginalized by Toledo and want one of their own as coach. That was
always thought to be Neuheisel, 41, but support for Dorrell is
swelling.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a bunch of ex-players saying they want to come back to
the program," one source said. "These are the people pushing for
Karl."</TE>

<HD>UCLA Midfielder Has Got Mad Game</HD>
<DH>Futagaki's aggressive attitude is a big reason the Bruins
are two wins away from their fourth NCAA soccer championship.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Stephens</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ryan Futagaki makes it clear from the moment he steps onto the soccer
field. The UCLA senior isn't there to make friends.</LD>
<LD>   "Coaches haven't been too fond of me," he said. "It was like that
in high school too. Even my own coach told me if I wasn't on his team
he probably wouldn't like me, either."</LD>
<LD>   Futagaki has battled through a college career that has had highs
and lows. Even as the former starter at midfield adjusts to his
reserve role, he is ecstatic about the Bruins reaching the NCAA
College Cup in his final season.</LD>
<TE>   UCLA (16-3-3) will play Maryland in the semifinals Friday in
Dallas. Stanford plays Creighton in the night's other match.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins are making their 11th appearance in the Final Four and
are trying for their fourth national title.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the reason why I came here," said Futagaki, a two-time
All-Southern Section player at Fountain Valley High. "One of my
goals, even when I was younger, was I wanted to win a national
championship. Now that we're in the Final Four, I want that ring."</TE>
<TE>   On a team loaded with scoring threats, finding the net isn't
Futagaki's main job. It never has been -- he has three goals and
three assists this season and nine goals and 10 assists in four
years.</TE>
<TE>   The fifth-year senior and team co-captain is supposed to win the
individual battles and set up attacks. More often than not, he is
tangled up with an opponent trying to win those battles.</TE>
<TE>   Because of that dogged persistence, Futagaki was chosen one of 15
finalists for the Hermann Trophy, given to the nation's top
collegiate player.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a hard-nosed little bugger," UCLA Coach Tom Fitzgerald said.
"He gets under people's skin."</TE>
<TE>   The result is a number of yellow cards and the occasional red one.
Futagaki has four yellow cards this season and had to sit out the
Bruins' 4-2 second-round victory over Loyola Marymount this season
because of a red card drawn in last year's NCAA playoff match against
Southern Methodist.</TE>
<TE>   Aggressive play is in his nature. In club soccer as a teenager, he
had to win an appeal to be reinstated in the Orange County-based
Coast Soccer League because of an excessive number of red cards.</TE>
<TE>   "He's actually calmed down since he got to college," said forward
Tim Pierce, a teammate since their days with the Mission Viejo
Pateadores. "He was out of control then. But I think you need players
to complement each other on the field and he gives us some edge out
there."</TE>
<TE>   With age usually comes maturity. Futagaki said he has become a
smarter player.</TE>
<TE>   "Not to disrespect anyone but I'm not going to change the way I
play," he said. "There is a difference between playing smart, playing
physical and playing dirty. I've become a smart and physical player."</TE>
<TE>   Whether he riles up opposing coaches or players is least among his
worries. Futagaki has had his share of personal pain off the field.</TE>
<TE>   His father, Arnie, died in June after an eight-year battle with
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's
disease.</TE>
<TE>   Arnie Futagaki always attended his son's soccer matches even as
the illness robbed him of the ability to speak and left him confined
to a wheelchair. In his honor, Ryan wears his father's wedding ring
on his left finger.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard," Futagaki said. "I think about my dad a lot,
especially around the holidays. But I feel he's with somebody special
now. He's not suffering anymore."</TE>
<TE>   There has been more emotional pain -- his mother, Shirley, was
diagnosed with breast cancer two years ago. And there has been plenty
of physical pain.</TE>
<TE>   Futagaki lost a year to a knee injury suffered two matches into
the 2000 season. He played with a broken right wrist last season.</TE>
<TE>   And there have been the usual array of bumps and bruises over the
years, whether dealt out by his opponents or his older brothers,
Brandon and Brent. At 5 feet 7 inches and 150 pounds, Futagaki has
learned to combat his lack of size with speed and sheer
determination.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember one time back in club I didn't go in hard on a tackle
and this guy who was huge just killed my hamstring," he said. "I
learned then that I'll always go in hard no matter who it is. I'm
going to give 110% even if it hurts."</TE>

<HD>Hot Hands Carry USC to Victory</HD>
<DH>O'Neil makes nine of 10 shots, Hutchinson goes seven for
eight as Trojans regain confidence by beating Fullerton, 78-63.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than a dozen NBA scouts from 10 organizations found their way to
the Sports Arena on Wednesday night, presumably to catch a glimpse of
Cal State Fullerton junior center Pape Sow.</LD>
<LD>   Some other players probably also captured their attention.</LD>
<LD>   Especially after USC sophomore center Rory O'Neil and senior point
guard Robert Hutchinson had career nights in the Trojans' 78-63 win
over the Titans in front of 2,096.</LD>
<TE>   O'Neil finished with a career-high 22 points on nine-of-10
shooting and Hutchinson, who came off the bench and wasn't sure his
sore right ankle would allow him to play, scored 17 points, tying for
the most in his career. He made his first seven shots and finished
seven of eight.</TE>
<TE>   "Seven of eight and nine of 10 is unbelievable," USC Coach Henry
Bibby said as he stared at the stat sheet after the game. "But that's
the way they shoot it in practice."</TE>
<TE>   It's not the way they've been shooting it in games lately.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neil's confidence, as well as his body, was bruised by Missouri
and its beefy frontcourt in the Tigers' Wooden Classic victory over
the Trojans on Saturday, a game in which O'Neil had just five points
on two-of-10 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   A Monday meeting in Bibby's office reiterated the coach's faith in
O'Neil.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach always says to shoot the ball, to have confidence in
myself," said O'Neil, who also made two three-pointers and had seven
rebounds in 33 minutes before fouling out. "He wasn't going to go
away from me because I had one bad game. I had a couple of good looks
early and after that things just started rolling for me.</TE>
<TE>   "You just stop thinking about it and start shooting ... and it
goes in a lot easier, a lot smoother. You get confidence and once
that happens, it's automatic."</TE>
<TE>   USC (3-3) was anything but automatic in the early going.</TE>
<TE>   Until Hutchinson, who missed Saturday's loss with a sprained
ankle, entered the game at the 13:36 mark of the first half, the
Trojans were listless and trailing, 11-8.</TE>
<TE>   But behind his hot shooting and deft passing, USC found its groove
and took off from there, outscoring the Titans, 33-18, the remainder
of the half.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels good [to play well], but right now my ankle's killing
me," said Hutchinson, who also made all three of his three-point
attempts and had four assists, three steals and one turnover in 28
minutes. "You're just playing out there. When you start to think
about it, that's when your game falters."</TE>
<TE>   The only negative for the Trojans was the loss of junior center
Jonathan Oliver, who left the game midway through the first half
after hurting his left ankle in a scramble for the ball. He remained
in the locker room for the second half with his ankle elevated and
iced, and left the arena with his foot in a walking boot.</TE>
<TE>   USC, which shot a season-best 55.6% (10-18) from three-point
territory and a season-best 52.8% from the field, eventually built
its lead up to a game-high 25 points, 61-36, following a Desmon
Farmer three-pointer with 13:33 to play.</TE>
<TE>   The Titans (1-5) were led by sophomore guard Ralphy Holmes' 21
points. Sow, a 6-foot-10, 250-pounder from Senegal, finished with 18
points, 11 rebounds and three assists.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we did a good job of getting the ball to Pape Sow,"
said Titan Coach Donny Daniels. "USC was able to counter with their
size. We have to win games and other guys on this team have to step
up."</TE>

<LD>As expected, USC quarterback Carson Palmer was named Wednesday as one
of five finalists for the Heisman Trophy, the first Trojan to make
the cut since Rodney Peete in 1988.</LD>
<LD>   Quarterback Ken Dorsey and running back Willis McGahee of
top-ranked Miami, Iowa quarterback Brad Banks and Penn State running
back Larry Johnson also are finalists. The winner will be announced
Saturday at the Yale Club in New York.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm fired up -- it's a huge honor," Palmer said by phone from
Orlando, Fla., where he will take part in tonight's Home Depot
College Football Awards Show. "I wasn't thinking about it too much
because it was out of my hands."</LD>
<TE>   Palmer, who passed for 3,639 yards and 32 touchdowns this season,
has already won the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award as the nation's
top senior quarterback. He is a finalist for the Davey O'Brien award
(top quarterback) and Walter Camp award (top player), which are among
12 awards that will be announced tonight on ESPN from 4 to 6 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   USC safety Troy Polamalu is a finalist for the Thorpe award (top
defensive back).</TE>
<TE>   Palmer will collect the Unitas award on Friday in Louisville, Ky.,
and then travel to New York for the Heisman ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be crazy and I'm looking forward to it," said
Palmer, who could become the fifth USC player, and the first West
Coast player since USC's Marcus Allen, to win the Heisman.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey, who finished third in the Heisman voting last year, and
McGahee are the first teammates to finish among the top five since
1994 when Penn State running back Ki-Jana Carter was second and
quarterback Kerry Collins fourth. Colorado running back Rashaan
Salaam won the 1994 trophy.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey is 38-1 as a starter. He has passed for 3,073 yards and 26
touchdowns this season for Miami, which plays second-ranked Ohio
State in the Fiesta Bowl. McGahee rushed for 1,686 yards and 27
touchdowns, both school records.</TE>
<TE>   Banks led the nation in passing efficiency, passed for 2,369 yards
and 25 touchdowns and edged Palmer to become the Associated Press
player of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson rushed for a nation-leading 2,015 yards to become the
ninth Division I-A player gain more than 2,000 in a season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Orange Bowl game is sold out. About 7,500 of USC's 15,000
tickets are still available for sale, said Daryl Gross, a senior
associate athletic director.... USC Coach Pete Carroll, Mark Jackson,
the Trojans' director of football operations, and Steve Lopes, a
senior associate athletic director, were in Miami on Wednesday for
preliminary planning for the Orange Bowl.... The Trojans resume
practice today and will also work out Friday and Saturday.</TE>

<LD>Opposing coaches have tried all season, without much success, to stop
the top-ranked USC women's volleyball team.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight, a former Trojan coach will take his best shot.</LD>
<LD>   Chuck Erbe, who had a 310-121-3 record in two stints as USC's
coach (1976-77 and 1979-88), is coach of Michigan State, which will
face the Trojans in a semifinal of the NCAA West Regional at UC Santa
Barbara.</LD>
<TE>   Erbe, in his 10th season at Michigan State, guided USC to Assn. of
Intercollegiate Athletics for Women national titles in 1976, '77 and
'80. He also was at the Trojans' helm in 1981, when they won the
first and only NCAA championship.</TE>
<TE>   The top-seeded Trojans and unseeded Spartans play at 5 p.m.
Eighth-seeded UC Santa Barbara plays ninth-seeded Pepperdine at 7
p.m. The winners will play in the regional final at 7 p.m. Friday.</TE>
<TE>   USC (27-1), under second-year Coach Mick Haley, has won eight
consecutive matches, including playoff sweeps of the University of
San Diego and Texas A&amp;M.</TE>
<TE>   "For the most part, we've had the bull's-eye on us all year,"
Haley said.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine (25-6) has a school-record 16-match winning streak.
Santa Barbara (30-2) has lost only to Pepperdine and USC.</TE>
