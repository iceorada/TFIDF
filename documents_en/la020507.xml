<LD>'Spider-Man': A Record $114.8 Million</LD>
<LD>   "Spider-Man" fended off the Green Goblin and then raked in the
greenbacks, smashing box-office records left and right.</LD>
<LD>   The Columbia Pictures film, starring Tobey Maguire as the
web-slinging comic book superhero and directed by Sam Raimi, grossed
$114.8 million in its first three days in release, far eclipsing the
previous record three-day opening of $90.3 million set only last
November by Warner Bros.' "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone."</LD>

<HD>Will's 'Strategery'</HD>
<DH>Uh, make that strategy. Either way, Will Ferrell is leaving
'SNL' and George Bush behind.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Because the 2000 presidential campaign strayed into theater of the
absurd, Will Ferrell is leaving "Saturday Night Live" known most
prominently as "the guy who impersonates Bush."</LD>
<LD>   Being widely admired for your impression of a sitting president
isn't a terrible fate, but after seven seasons on "SNL," the
35-year-old Ferrell segues now into a career that will presumably
involve trying to become big at the movies--and in comedies, that
most hit-or-miss of genres.</LD>
<LD>   Ferrell lives in the Hollywood Hills but has been keeping an
apartment in New York for the purposes of his regular job. He is
leaving "SNL" for reasons you might expect, including the sense that,
after seven years, it is time.</LD>
<TE>   "It's kind of like dog years," he said of his career on the show,
which began in 1995, when Ferrell was plucked from the L.A. sketch
comedy troupe the Groundlings by "SNL" founder and executive producer
Lorne Michaels.</TE>
<TE>   In leaving, Ferrell said he uses an analogy that Michaels hated
hearing: He didn't want to become that guy who's already graduated
from high school but still hangs out in his van in the parking lot,
picking up seniors.</TE>
<TE>   Will he be the next Bill Murray or Dana Carvey? There is no
predicting this, really (why did it happen for Rob Schneider but
never for the late Phil Hartman?), but three upcoming at-bats may
shed light on Ferrell: "Old School," to be released Sept. 27, in
which Ferrell, Luke Wilson and Vince Vaughn play thirtysomething
friends who start their own fraternity next door to a college; "Elf,"
with Ferrell as a human being raised at the North Pole who discovers
that he isn't actually an elf; and "Ron Burgundy," with Ferrell cast
as a longtime local newsman suddenly saddled with a female co-anchor
(think Jerry Dunphy in smaller market and circa 1976).</TE>
<TE>   If all three are made, and even one becomes a hit, the meetings
that Ferrell is taking with movie people will no doubt change. "I'm
in that category of, 'Oh, he's funny,'" Ferrell said of the current
response he elicits from executives. It isn't hard to imagine what
thought comes next: But can he open a movie?</TE>
<TE>   If talent were the sole criterion, you'd want to bet on him. As he
closes out his "SNL" tenure on May 18, the show's season finale,
Ferrell leaves behind a legacy worthy of all the "SNL" reruns that
Comedy Central--and, soon, E! Entertainment Television--air to fill
out the day.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to George W. Bush, Ferrell was Alex Trebek, the
simmering, superior "Jeopardy!" host. He was Craig, Spartan Spirit
cheerleader; and Marty Culp, middle school music teacher who, with
wife Bobbi, performed horrific covers of pop hits that inevitably had
the kids hurling garbage at the stage. He was James Lipton, the
constipated-with-awe host of Bravo's "Inside the Actors Studio."</TE>
<TE>   If the disparate characters had anything in common, it was that
they were infused with Ferrell's ability to create comic tension
between the exterior, contained self and the inner mess of a person
who longed to get out.</TE>
<TE>   On "SNL," which too often settles for repertory players
impersonating pop culture figures, Ferrell was less a mimic than an
interpreter. And didn't many of his characters seem on the verge of
nervous breakdowns?</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in a booth at Victors deli in Hollywood Friday night,
Ferrell betrays a sense of eccentricity, hiding several layers of
himself underneath the particular layer he was showing.</TE>
<TE>   It was hard to imagine, given all those characters, that Ferrell
comes from Irvine or that he enrolled at USC with aspirations of
becoming a sports information director or broadcaster.</TE>
<TE>   Ferrell ordered hot tea and said he had to get up early the next
morning to go on a 20-mile run (three times around Griffith Park),
part of a training regimen he and his wife, Viveca, are putting
themselves through before running the Stockholm Marathon in June.</TE>
<TE>   After the run, Ferrell was getting on a plane for New York to
participate in NBC's 75th anniversary celebration, a TV event
broadcast Sunday night and about which Ferrell seemed a little
dubious.</TE>
<TE>   In giving up his TV job, Ferrell leaves behind lots of money and
characters that are owned by the show, not by the performer. To that
end, Michaels has turned "SNL" into an incubator for quick-and-dirty
features based on show sketches.</TE>
<TE>   The movies, produced by Michaels and backed by Paramount Pictures
and NBC, are supposed to spawn the next "Wayne's World" franchise.
Only this hasn't much happened.</TE>
<TE>   Ferrell has appeared in a slew of them, co-starring in 1998's "A
Night at the Roxbury," which was based on two disco-hopping
characters performed on the show by Ferrell and Chris Kattan.</TE>
<TE>   Yet that movie and others--including last year's "Zoolander," in
which Ferrell played an evil fashion designer--have failed to move
him beyond the "Oh, he's funny" perception.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Ferrell is focusing on new ideas, including "Ron Burgundy,"
the news anchor comedy, which Ferrell dreamed up with "SNL" writer
Adam McKay.</TE>
<TE>   He and McKay want to recapture the spirit of the "Animal House"
and "Caddyshack" ensemble bacchanals that featured "SNL" alumni John
Belushi, Chevy Chase and Bill Murray but were more than simply star
vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   "Adam and I feel like comedy films are missing what those late
'70s comedies had," Ferrell said.</TE>
<TE>   He knows that making a movie can be painstaking--unlike the
seat-of-the-pants manner in which comedy sometimes happens on "SNL."</TE>
<TE>   He'll miss the action, the high-wire act of doing live TV, the
Fridays on which he and the writers are still throwing together the
Bush sketch, pending breaking news. Comedians, like presidents, have
their term limits.</TE>

<HD>Vega Quartet Makes a Triumphant L.A. Debut</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>And still they come, the highly accomplished, brightly polished young
string quartets. Making its local debut Sunday afternoon, a
multiple-competition winner, the Vega String Quartet, joined the
parade. And triumphed.</LD>
<LD>   Four young people from Shanghai who graduated from the
conservatory there, then went their separate ways only to re-form
under a new ensemble name, the Vega quartet--violinists Wendy Yun
Chen and Jessica Shuang Wu, violist Yinzi Kong and cellist Guang
Wang--appeared in the Chamber Music in Historic Sites series.
Performed twice, its intermission-less program--Haydn's Quartet in G,
Opus 76, No. 1, Soonjung Suh's "Reminiscence" and the Debussy
Quartet--gave a full picture of the ensemble's abundant strengths.</LD>
<LD>   Dominant is a single-minded and relentless concentration that
gives sweep and perspective to the music at hand. The group's Haydn
possessed surface beauties, mechanical superiority and a compelling
sense of authority. It glowed with musicality and balance.</LD>
<TE>   In contrast, "Reminiscence" specialized in hostile feelings,
anger, anxiety and even violence; what the composer seems to be
remembering is all negative. The quartet gave the 10-minute piece a
fair and disturbing account.</TE>
<TE>   Equally full-throated yet markedly different, the Debussy work
realized all the disparate hues in the composer's palette, from
fragile delicacy to virile aggression and eloquent songfulness. It is
a great canvas, and its many beauties were revealed again here, in a
magnificent setting, the recently restored, 52-year-old Harvey
Aluminum House above Los Feliz.</TE>

<HD>In His Collection, Turban Is Perfect Fit</HD>
<DH>Television: An expert on Hollywood memorabilia has been
entrusted by Johnny Carson to care for 'Tonight Show' treasures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SONDRA FARRELL BAZROD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When you're an overweight kid who is definitely not an after-school
sports jock, there's just one thing left to do: Rush home, grab the
Doritos, and plop down in front of the TV.</LD>
<LD>   Fast forward to the James Comisar of today. At 37, he is a
slimmed-down curator of American pop culture who claims to have
amassed more Hollywood television memorabilia than anyone else,
including the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. While he owns
items such as Jeannie's bottle from "I Dream of Jeannie," Maxwell
Smart's shoe phone from "Get Smart" and Spock's ears from the
original "Star Trek," the crowning glory of his collection is the
career ephemera of Johnny Carson, including "The Tonight Show" set
and Carnac turban, which Carson personally presented to Comisar.</LD>
<LD>   "To me, Mr. Carson is the king of television, and the turban he
wore as Carnac is his crown," says Comisar, who will only call his
idol "Mr. Carson." "I wouldn't call the President 'George,' nor would
I call Mr. Carson 'Johnny.'"</LD>
<TE>   Approaching the 10th anniversary of Carson's retirement, Comisar
is quick to point out that since he took possession, nobody
(including him) has ever sat in his idol's chair or worn the Carnac
turban.</TE>
<TE>   The journey from the time young Comisar would sneak out of his
bedroom to watch "The Tonight Show" to the day he arrived at Carson's
door took many twists and turns. At 17, he dropped out of UCLA to
become a television writer.</TE>
<TE>   "My first gig was writing questions for bachelorettes on 'The
Dating Game,'" he said. "It was my first break. Then I started
writing for comics like Joan Rivers and Howie Mandel and went on to
write shows for Fred Silverman and Norman Lear. Some aired for 10
minutes and were gone, but I was thrilled to be working in TV, and
the checks cleared the bank."</TE>
<TE>   He found that writers would go for two-hour lunches, which wasn't
for him now that he had lost weight, so he would grab an apple and
walk around the studio lot. He liked to walk through the costume
department to see if he could recognize costumes from his childhood,
and eventually he did. When he asked to buy the items, he was told
they could only be rented by production companies.</TE>
<TE>   "I came up with a plan," he says. "I offered to pay a year's
rental fee in advance, and in the end I would own the items. They
told me they thought I was crazy, but OK."</TE>
<TE>   First he just wanted a few pieces to put in his studio office.
Then he filled his closet at home, the garage, a storage unit, then
10 storage units. "I decided I needed to build a world-class archive
of these television treasures," Comisar says.</TE>
<TE>   Comisar now needed a way to finance his acquisitions, so he became
a Hollywood expert for auction companies and has since authenticated
tens of millions of dollars of items for companies all over the
world. He also has celebrity clients who are equally star-struck and
enjoy collecting from other well-known people.</TE>
<TE>   When George Burns died, Comisar was called in to help auction off
his personal items for the charities that were dear to Burns. "I feel
in some small way I represent them after they've gone," he says.
"It's vital that their ephemera is handled with dignity, because they
aren't here to protect themselves. I'll never forget when I first
entered Mr. Burns' bedroom. I was touched to see that even though
Gracie died over 30 years earlier, he still kept her eyeglasses on
her nightstand."</TE>
<TE>   Then came the day Comisar heard Carson was retiring. "I felt like
other people did when they heard Elvis had died. It was a terrible
shock, and I sent a letter to 'The Tonight Show' requesting the
opportunity to care for costumes and props. I immediately received a
response from Helen Sanders, Mr. Carson's assistant. The answer was
no."</TE>
<TE>   In the coming days and months, there were many more calls, letters
and faxes to Carson's office. Persistence paid off.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been 10 years since James first called and I found him to be
genuine, sincere and very passionate about what he preserved," says
Sanders, who went to see highlights from Comisar's collection and
realized he was an excellent conservator. Carson agreed to give him
the Carnac turban, which he had already taken home, so he invited
Comisar to come pick it up.</TE>
<TE>   "When I got that call it was one of those magical, sparkling life
moments," Comisar says. "More than the artifacts, it was the idea
that Mr. Carson was trusting me to play a small part in his legacy.
He is no less to me than a childhood hero, a father figure and a TV
legend, so you can well imagine that seeing to his artifacts is a
responsibility I take damn seriously....</TE>
<TE>   "I've met many TV stars, but Mr. Carson made a special request of
me that no one before or since has asked for. He said to me, 'We did
our little show and we helped some people with their careers, and
that's fine, but please don't make a big deal over my stuff. If it's
important to you, take it and keep it, but don't build a shrine."</TE>
<TE>   To a dedicated fan like Comisar, hearing Carson "shrugging off 30
years of pioneering television as a 'little show'" was mind-boggling.
A year later, he received another call from Sanders: "The Tonight
Show" set was returning from the Epcot Center in Florida, and Carson
wanted to know if he wanted to own and conserve it.</TE>
<TE>   Comisar is now negotiating a national tour of highlights from his
collection that will visit museums across North America for five
years. Though he's tight-lipped about the details, he adds, "As they
say in TV, stay tuned."</TE>

<HD>Opus One Adds a Thoughtful Voice to Post-Attack Dialogue</HD>

<LD>It was inevitable that the events of Sept. 11 would trigger a stream
of musical reaction. And we heard a particularly thoughtful one
Sunday at Caltech's Beckman Auditorium from USC's Stephen Hartke, who
wrote a piano quartet for the touring group of chamber music
all-stars Opus One.</LD>
<LD>   Based on themes from Thomas Tallis' "Lamentations of Jeremiah,"
the 13-minute work bears the haunting title "Beyond Words." There is
also a subtitle, the musical term ricercar--which means "a seeking
out""--and you do get the feeling that this lonely threnody is
searching aimlessly and fruitlessly for some shred of meaning in
these events, with dissonant strings often interrupted by the
gleaming, disembodied solo piano.</LD>
<LD>   There is no angst, no patriotic defiance, just desolation
reminiscent of the last chamber works of Shostakovich in mood. And it
stays with you long after its conclusion.</LD>
<TE>   Opus One consists of pianist Anne-Marie McDermott, violinist Ida
Kavafian, violist Steven Tenenbom and cellist Peter Wiley. Kavafian's
fiercely assertive tone quality was often the dominant voice among
the strings, while McDermott cut the most diverse profile, sometimes
playful, sometimes coaxing.</TE>
<TE>   Though they were not at their most polished form in Dvorak's Opus
87 Piano Quartet, their impetuosity brought fire to many passages,
and McDermott, Kavafian and Wiley sailed unruffled through Haydn's
"Gypsy Rondo" Piano Trio.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In "Pat Hobby's Preview," one of F. Scott Fitzgerald's fictional
tales about a down-on-his-luck Hollywood screenwriter, Hobby tries to
impress a star-struck young woman by taking her to the premiere of a
picture he co-wrote. But Hobby's tickets are no good, and the
hard-boiled doorman won't let Hobby or his date inside.</LD>
<LD>   "You don't understand," Hobby says. "I wrote this picture." The
doorman replies, "Sure. In a pipe dream." Just before Hobby gets the
heave-ho, his co-writer emerges from the theater. "Go and look," he
roars. "I think the prop boy directed it!" Before storming off, he
tells the doorman, "It's all right. He wrote it. I wouldn't have my
name on an inch of it."</LD>
<LD>   Why do good scripts go bad? It's an age-old complaint in
Hollywood, from downtrodden screenwriters as well as beleaguered
executives trying to explain how the stinker you just saw began life
as a sparkling gem. John Scott Shepherd hasn't read the "Hobby"
stories, which Fitzgerald wrote in 1939 and 1940 when the novelist
was a downtrodden hack himself, working at Universal Pictures, then a
B-movie factory. But maybe now would be a good time to start.</LD>
<TE>   If you didn't know Shepherd's original work, you'd think he was a
hack too. His two produced scripts have resulted in crashingly bad
and unsuccessful movies: "Joe Somebody," released last Christmas,
featuring Tim Allen as a put-upon office worker (remember those awful
ads with Allen wearing a boxing glove and carrying a briefcase?), and
the recently released "Life or Something Like It," which stars
Angelina Jolie (in a blond fright wig) as an ambitious TV anchorwoman
who reexamines her life after being told by a street prophet that she
only has a week to live.</TE>
<TE>   "Life," which cost $40 million, has only taken in less than $11
million at the box office and was greeted with derisive reviews, many
putting the blame on Shepherd's screenplays (he shared notoriety on
"Life" with Dana Stevens, who did the rewrite).</TE>
<TE>   I would never have given Shepherd a second glance except for the
fact that the 38-year-old former advertising executive is actually a
gifted writer. His original "Life" script had shades of "American
Beauty's" dark satiric edge, while his debut novel, "Henry's List of
Wrongs," is a witty, Nick Hornsby-esque gem about a coldblooded
corporate raider's struggle with spiritual rebirth. He has a
distinctive voice and writes sparkling dialogue for brash,
contemporary characters.</TE>
<TE>   Talk about having a Hollywood writer's highs and lows. Shepherd's
novel sold for $1.1 million, and he's made pots of money from selling
TV pilots and scripts, including one that's intended as a vehicle for
Julia Roberts. Yet his screenplays have been dumbed down, rejected by
the public and trashed by the critics. Is it any wonder that when I
took him to lunch recently to discuss his experiences in Hollywood,
he went through three Bloody Marys in barely more time than it would
take Shaquille O'Neal to polish off a couple of steaks?</TE>
<TE>   Shepherd is careful to avoid casting himself as an innocent among
philistines. But his cold-eyed account of his scripts' bumpy passage
makes it clear that for the writer in Hollywood, little has changed
since Fitzgerald's days. Shepherd's is a cautionary tale about any
writer's bruising encounter with the deadly trap of studio script
development.</TE>
<TE>   "I got a tough lesson in what happens when everyone is trying to
make the characters more palatable, but to the point where you lose
the real voice of the movie," Shepherd said. "We had a lot of people
in the room during script meetings, and it often felt like they were
giving notes because they felt they should have something to say to
justify their presence, even though they really didn't have any clear
point of view. I must admit I was baffled a lot of the time."</TE>
<TE>   Shepherd doesn't disguise his feelings about "Joe Somebody,"
saying, "God, do I hate that movie!" His original script was an edgy
comedy, but when Allen was cast in the role and the movie was
packaged as a holiday-season family movie, Shepherd was taken off the
job and the dark comic elements were written out of the script.</TE>
<TE>   The problems with "Life or Something Like It" are more
complicated, according to several people involved in making the film.
Shepherd sold the script to New Regency in late 1998. Working with
producer John Davis and New Regency, who was bankrolling the film,
Shepherd did six script rewrites, largely geared to making his TV
anchorwoman more likable.</TE>
<TE>   "The likability issue came up a lot," he recalls. "People kept
saying, 'I don't think this woman is sympathetic enough.' But it
really confused what the movie was about. I kept arguing, if we make
her more self-aware, then where's the arc for her character? There's
no epiphany when she realizes how empty her life has become."</TE>
<TE>   In Shepherd's script, the TV anchorwoman ends up falling in a love
with a wisecracking TV cameraman, played by Ed Burns. Shepherd wrote
him as a bachelor. In the movie, he is suddenly revealed to be the
father of a boy who spends a day with Burns and Jolie, then
disappears, never to be seen again.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a constant debate over whether we could cheer for a guy
who was just a cameraman," Shepherd says. "In my world, living in
Kansas City, to work as a news cameraman at a network affiliate would
be a perfectly good job. There was just a gulf between my perception
of him and what people in Hollywood thought was a good job."</TE>
<TE>   Many other things changed. In Shepherd's original script, the
Jolie character investigates a corrupt TV minister. In the film, she
lands an interview with a Barbara Walters-type TV queen, played by
Stockard Channing. In Shepherd's script, the Jolie character nearly
dies at movie's end after being hit by a newspaper truck. In the
movie, she is shot accidentally by an armed robber. As something of a
novice screenwriter, Shepherd had trouble absorbing a blizzard of
script notes and incorporating the good ideas while ignoring the bad
ones.</TE>
<TE>   "My first rewrite was terrible, because I tried to please
everybody," he admits. He thought his last draft was his best, but no
one else agreed. He was fired from the film shortly afterward. With
the project stalled, producer John Davis brought in Stevens, who'd
written "For Love of the Game" and "City of Angels." She wrote a
draft that got director Joel Schumacher on board; he wanted to make
the film with Renee Zellweger. New Regency balked, thinking Zellweger
didn't have enough star power.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher left after getting an offer to do another picture. But
days later, Jolie read the script and signed on. Though the critics
later carped that she was horribly wrong for the role, Regency saw
her as one of the few bankable actresses who could open the movie
here and overseas. With a writers' strike fast approaching, Regency
quickly signed director Stephen Herek, known for making broad
comedies and dramas, including such hits as "Mr. Holland's Opus" and
such flops as "Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead."</TE>
<TE>   Jolie was responsible for another ill-fated choice: She decided
her character should be a garish platinum blond. Most people involved
with the film thought it was a horrible idea, but Herek supported her
and no one seriously tried talking her out of it. The filmmakers were
so concerned about Jolie's look that they inserted several jokes
allowing characters to make fun of her hair color. It was a feeble
solution: Women were so turned off by her appearance in the TV spots
that they stayed away in droves.</TE>
<TE>   Jolie's outlandish appearance was emblematic of a series of
alterations that robbed the movie of any semblance of believability.
Like all too many of today's Hollywood movies, "Life or Something
Like It" is a fantasy with utterly no connection to actual life.
Jolie's interview with Channing is preposterously tearful, and we are
asked to believe that she would get a network tryout after making a
fool out of herself on the air drunkenly singing "Satisfaction" with
a crowd of striking transit workers.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1930s, during the height of Hollywood screwball comedy,
films like "My Man Godfrey" and "It Happened One Night" were rooted
in reality--their madcap humor didn't ignore the squalor of the
Depression. Today's studio movies are scrubbed clean of any
resemblance to real events. As reviewer Mike Clark of USA Today
succinctly put it: "The movie's portrayal of local TV news makes
'Death to Smoochy' look like a PBS documentary."</TE>
<TE>   In their quest for commercial success, studio executives often
dilute or destroy what they liked about a script to start with--its
verve and originality--and they lack the courage to confront creative
types, be they wrongheaded movie stars or directors. What "Life"
lacked was one strong voice in the script meeting, be it a powerful
producer or executive, who would arbitrate debates and keep the movie
going in one consistent direction.</TE>
<TE>   Like so many writers who've seen their scripts ground up into
sausage, Shepherd is eager to work outside the studio system. "Too
often, making a studio movie is like stitching together a shirt with
all the different colors and fabrics," he says. "When you're
finished, they make you hold it up and spray-paint the word 'SHIRT'
on it in big, bold letters so that everyone knows you're holding up a
shirt. So the next time I'm writing a movie, I'm going to try to
please myself, not everyone else in the room."</TE>

<LD>The Playboy Jazz Festival kicked off its annual series of free
community concerts Sunday afternoon with performances by the
Hollywood Klezmer Jazz Quintet and the Bobby Rodriguez Salsa
Orchestra at the Beverly Hills Civic Center Plaza. Blessed with clear
skies and warm temperatures, the event drew a crowd of more than 600
listeners to the attractive, open-air setting.</LD>
<LD>   "Klezmer" and "Jazz" may seem to be an odd coupling, but there are
considerable similarities between the two genres, including
dance-like rhythms, spontaneous ensemble interaction and
improvisational solo inventions.</LD>
<LD>   The Hollywood Klezmer Jazz Quintet's front-line clarinetist, Leo
Chelyapov, has more traditional roots, but his inspired soloing at
the Beverly Hills performance was alive with an early-jazz sort of
communicativeness. Using a colorful catalog of trills, note smears,
glissandos, laughing sounds and gurgles, he transformed every solo
into a high-flying musical excursion--doing so, at one point, while
walking through the capacity crowd in Kenny G's best
reach-out-and-touch-your-listeners fashion.</LD>
<TE>   "Bie Mir Bist Du Schoen" was on the menu, of course, but there
were other, less familiar items as well, often showcasing other
individual players: guitarist Jordan Charnofsky, bassist Larry Steen,
drummer Robert "Jake" Jacobs and violinist Bob Korda. Further
highlighting the set was the appearance of Rodriguez as a guest
performer, his trumpet adding a clarion voice to the proceedings, his
solo style emphasizing the Sephardic elements of the music.</TE>
<TE>   When he brought his own orchestra to the stage, Rodriguez was even
more entertaining. Matching his trumpet artistry with his equally
engaging entertainment persona, he sang, did a few salsa steps and
persuaded members of the audience to show off their own dance
routines. All this to the accompaniment of his big, roaring ensemble,
with solo spots for veteran percussionist Alex Acuna and talented
young pianist Gerald Clayton in tunes ranging from a salsa-drenched
arrangement of "Blue Skies" to the body-moving rhythms of the son
montuna, "Josefina."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The next free Playboy Jazz Festival event is Friday: The
Multi-School Jazz Band, directed by Reggie Andrews, in a Watts Senior
Citizens' concert, Phoenix Hall, 10950 S. Central Ave., 11 a.m.-1

<HD>Four Beloved Live-Action Disney Films Now on DVD</HD>
<DH>Home Video: Cast and crew from 'Pollyanna,' 'Old Yeller,'
'Swiss Family Robinson' and 'Parent Trap' remember Walt's hands-on
involvement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hayley Mills recalls that things didn't go very well on her first day
of shooting "Pollyanna," the 1960 Walt Disney drama for which she won
a juvenile Academy Award. In fact, she did so poorly in her scene
with veteran Karl Malden that her father, Sir John Mills, told her
she had as much personality as a vegetable.</LD>
<LD>   "I was just sort of being boring," says the actress, who recently
moved from London to New York City. "I think I was being distracted,
really, by the size of the set and the people and being out there in
the blistering California sun."</LD>
<LD>   Mills, then 13, had only made one film in her native England--the
acclaimed 1959 black-and-white drama, "Tiger Bay." And here she was
suddenly starring in a big-budget, high-profile period drama about a
plucky orphan opposite such stars as Malden, Jane Wyman, Agnes
Moorehead and Adolphe Menjou.</LD>
<TE>   "I wasn't concentrating on what I was doing," says Mills, 56, who
continues to act on stage and in TV. "I was much more interested in
what was going on around me. The unit was so vast. There were so many
crew members. And I was dying for the lunch break because there were
all of these wonderful things to eat that I had never seen before."</TE>
<TE>   But after her conversation with her father, Mills knew she had to
buckle down. By calling her a vegetable, "I think he just sort of
understood that I would understand what that meant."</TE>
<TE>   "Pollyanna" is one of four beloved Disney live-action films being
released on DVD today in fully restored, two-disc sets. The "Vault
Disney Collection" ($30 each) also features the 1957 boy-and-his-dog
melodrama "Old Yeller"; the 1960 action-adventure film "Swiss Family
Robinson"; and Mills' 1961 comedy, "The Parent Trap," in which she
plays twins who go through an elaborate ruse to get their divorced
parents back together.</TE>
<TE>   The discs include audio commentary from stars and directors; new
documentaries on the making of the films; production archives;
episodes from Disney's TV series, "Disneyland" and "The Wonderful
World of Disney"; vintage cartoons; audio excerpts and several other
featurettes.</TE>
<TE>   Mills and others involved in making these films say the hand of
studio-chief Disney is evident throughout.</TE>
<TE>   "He was involved in all of his movies and in the shooting and the
storyboards and how he wanted it to look," she says. "Some directors,
I think, thought he was a bit too much involved. But they had to do
it his way. And his way was pretty good. He knew what he was talking
about and he was a very great leader."</TE>
<TE>   "Swiss Family Robinson," which starred John Mills, Dorothy
McGuire, Tommy Kirk, Kevin Corcoran and James MacArthur, was the
fourth and final film Ken Annakin ("The Longest Day") directed for
Disney. "With Walt, when you had a discussion, even if he said this
is an idea off the top of my head, if you opposed that or had any
slight objection to it, you could make sure that would be in," says
the 87-year-old British director.</TE>
<TE>   One thing Disney wanted included in this lavish adaptation of
Johann Wyss' novel about a shipwrecked family was a tiger, Annakin
recalls. "When he raised the idea of the tiger, I said, 'You know,
Walt, I have worked with a lion, and lions and tigers are very
difficult to work with. But I think a lion might be better than a
tiger.' He immediately said, 'Ken is afraid of a tiger.' From that
moment, every time the tiger was raised, he would say, 'We'll do this
and this with the tiger--of course, if Ken feels he can do it.'"</TE>
<TE>   Working with Disney, Annakin says, was wonderful "as long as you
kept to the lines of what he had agreed. Every sequence in the
picture had been through Walt's brain. This picture was very unusual.
We developed the story to what the characters would be like and then,
halfway through, Walt said to me, 'I am going to give you a
storyboard artist and we are going to develop the rest of the picture
on storyboard, and then we'll hand it over to the writer and he'll
put some lines in for the actors.' That's what we did."</TE>
<TE>   MacArthur, best known as Danno on "Hawaii Five-O," made four
features for Disney early in his career, including "Swiss Family
Robison." MacArthur, 64, and Annakin have remained close friends over
the decades.</TE>
<TE>   The actor recalls that the cast became one happy family on
location on the island of Tobago near Trinidad. "Everybody was having
fun," says MacArthur. "You look back on that and I was like 20 or 21
and I was on this island with pirate ships and was playing poker with
Sessue Hayakawa ('The Bridge on the River Kwai')."</TE>
<TE>   Hayakawa, who played the captain of the band of pirates, brought
his two geishas with him on location. "One of his ladies would always
hold an umbrella over him and the other one would bring his meals or
any refreshment he wanted," Annakin recalls.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never gotten over that," MacArthur says of Hayakawa's
geishas. "They framed my entire approach to life ever since. I have
been trying to get two women to fan me for 40-odd years but I'm still
in search of them."</TE>
<TE>   Corcoran, 52, is in three of the Disney movies in the collection:
"Old Yeller," "Pollyanna" and "Swiss Family Robinson." He came to
fame as the irrepressible Moochie on the "Spin and Marty" serial on
"The Mickey Mouse Club" and was in numerous Disney TV productions and
movies, frequently as the character of Moochie.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a lot of just extremely talented people who Walt would
gather together and put on a project," says Corcoran, who is now
first assistant director on the NBC series, "Providence." "It was
wonderful. You learned a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Like MacArthur, who played his older brother in "Swiss Family
Robinson," Corcoran had a great time in Tobago. "We were there for
five or six months," he says. "One of my brothers got to go with me
so I had a friend with me, which made it even more fun because my
parents were afraid I would get homesick."</TE>
<TE>   "Old Yeller," based on Fred Gipson's novel, was Corcoran's first
big movie role. He has fond memories of Spike, the 160-pound
lab/mastiff who played the lead role. "He was an unusual and
incredible animal," Corcoran says. "He had a head on him the size of
a bear and he was just this huge, smart, lovable yellow dog. I used
to ride him around like he was a pony."</TE>
<TE>   He recalls that Disney visited the set of "Old Yeller" nearly
every day. "He really was a hands-on kind of a guy. He was like a
little bee who would go around and pollinate all the different
places. He would be there making sure it was the way that he wanted."</TE>
<TE>   "Old Yeller" was the final film that Fess Parker, who had come to
overnight fame two years earlier as Davy Crockett on the phenomenally
popular "Disneyland" series, made for Disney. Parker says fans still
talk to him about "Old Yeller"--something he never anticipated at the
time they were shooting the movie. "It was just something that we
were assigned to do and we enjoyed doing it," says the 76-year-old
Parker, who owns successful wineries and hotels in Los Olivos.</TE>
<TE>   The film reminded him of his childhood in central Texas in the
1930s. In fact, he says, author Gipson was a reporter for his
hometown newspaper. "My dad and Fred Gipson were friends and, of
course, we renewed our friendship when we were making the picture,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>   Mills says the longevity and appeal of the films she did for
Disney never cease to surprise her. "Of course, the truth is that
things that strike you when you are growing up you always remember,
because it is part of your developing awareness of yourself and the
world," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "The movies you see and the books that you read and the music you
hear and the people you meet make an impression on you. So I realized
eventually that for a lot of people, these films are part of the nuts
and bolts that put them together."</TE>

<HD>Face to Face Touches Angst Where It Hurts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As long as the road from adolescence to adulthood involves pain,
disappointment and anger, there will be a place for a no-frills punk
band that taps those emotions as powerfully as Face to Face does.</LD>
<LD>   The Inland Empire group opened a series of Southland shows Sunday
at the House of Blues in Anaheim with renewed focus and energy that
resulted from both the departure of guitarist Chad Yaro, reducing the
group to a muscular trio for the first time since it formed in the
early '90s, and some musical compromises stemming from its days as a
major-label act.</LD>
<LD>   Its new album, "How to Ruin Everything," touches on the band's own
troubles as well as on those it sees in the world at large, most of
which revolve around the toll daily living can take on one's ideals.</LD>
<TE>   That's nothing new for punk rock, and Face to Face doesn't offer
much that hasn't been played or sung before by the likes of the Clash
and Social Distortion. But singer-guitarist and chief songwriter
Trever Keith infuses such passion into his music that the
time-honored punk tradition never turns formulaic.</TE>
<TE>   In "Shoot the Moon," one of several songs drawn from the new CD
during the intense 65-minute set, Keith was both wistful and defiant
as he sang about a time not long ago when "I thought the world would
change with the right song."</TE>
<TE>   OK, so maybe it'll take more than one. But things could be worse
when the attempts remain as lively as this.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Face to Face plays Wednesday, Friday and Saturday with Thrice, the
Movie Life and Midtown at the House of Blues, 8430 Sunset Blvd., West
Hollywood, 7 p.m. $15. (323) 858-5100. Also Thursday at the Glass
House, 200 W. 2nd St., Pomona. 7 p.m. $15. (909) 629-0377; Sunday at

<LD>   CBS Planning Movie About JFK Jr.</LD>
<LD>   CBS confirmed Monday that it is developing a TV movie about John
F. Kennedy Jr., based on the new biography "American Son." It will
probably air next season, a spokeswoman said.</LD>
<TE>   An unknown actor will play the late son of the late U.S. president
to avoid the distraction of having a celebrity portray a real-life
celebrity, said Ed Gernon, executive vice president of movies and
miniseries for Alliance Atlantis, which owns the book rights with
True Entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   The next step is to hire a writer to adapt the book by Richard
Blow, an editor at Kennedy's defunct George magazine. Kennedy was 38
when he and his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister,
Lauren Bessette, died in a 1999 plane crash near Martha's Vineyard.</TE>

<TE>   Yet Another Version of 'Spider-Man'</TE>
<TE>   After last week's announcement that a stage version of
"Spider-Man" may be coming to a theater near you, MTV jumped on the
Marvel Comics juggernaut Monday by announcing it has a new cartoon
series about the webbed one in the works.</TE>
<TE>   The latest animated installment of "Spider-Man" will feature the
voices of Neil Patrick Harris (the former star of TV's "Doogie
Howser, M.D."), singer Lisa Loeb ("Cake and Pie") and Ian Ziering
("Beverly Hills 90210"). Produced by Columbia TriStar Domestic
Television Family Entertainment, it is slated to premiere next
winter.</TE>

<TE>   Several New Projects Are in the Works</TE>
<TE>   Twentieth Century Fox has bought the rights to "The Day After
Tomorrow," a big-budget movie about the disastrous effects of global
warming. Roland Emmerich will direct.... Anand Tucker ("Hilary and
Jackie") will direct Steve Martin in the big-screen adaptation of
Martin's best-selling novella "Shopgirl," the story of an aspiring
artist who works at Neiman Marcus........Jennifer Lopez will star in
and produce an updated version of the classic opera "Carmen,"
according to Variety....Tim Burton has signed to direct "Big Fish,"
the story of a dying father and his son, for Columbia Pictures.</TE>

<TE>   THEATER</TE>
<TE>   Drabinsky Bound for Broadway--in Absentia</TE>
<TE>   Producer Garth Drabinsky ("Ragtime," "Show Boat") has been unable
to set foot in the United States since the Canadian impresario was
charged with criminal fraud of as much as $100 million. But he's
planning on reviving "The Dresser"--the 1980 London backstage
drama--on Broadway, the New York Times reports.</TE>
<TE>   "My intention is not to wither and die but to keep working," he
said, reiterating his innocence.</TE>
<TE>   Though it would obviously be better for him to be on site, he
said, Drabinsky doesn't expect to travel with the production. He has
already recruited a director--"Morning's at Seven's" Daniel
Sullivan--and a set designer, Santo Loquasto ("The Elephant Man,"
"Fosse"). The cast has not yet been selected. The show is expected to
arrive in New York next spring after a run at the Elgin Theater in
Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan indicted Drabinsky and a
partner, Myron I. Gottlieb, in 1999 on six counts of fraud and
conspiracy. The duo--and other employees--were accused of taking
kickbacks from contractors working on his theaters and hiding losses
of more than $60,000.</TE>

<TE>   DANCE</TE>
<TE>   Graham Troupe to Stage 1-Night Reunion</TE>
<TE>   "Indisputably Martha Graham," a one-night performance scheduled to
take place at New York's City Center on Thursday, marks the first
time the Martha Graham troupe has returned to the stage since it
suspended operations in May 2000.</TE>
<TE>   And the title of the evening, whether intentional or not, has more
than a touch of irony, because the company has been embroiled in a
heated legal dispute over the legacy of the legendary choreographer.
At stake is the ownership of Graham's pioneering work.</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Protas, a former photographer who became close to Graham in
her later years, claims that he has the rights to the dances--and the
right to license them for performance through the Graham Trust, which
he, as Graham's heir, heads. In January 2001, he sued the center,
saying that he owned the trademark to Graham's name and pioneering
dance technique. The Graham Center of Contemporary Dance--which
operates the Graham dance company and school--says that, while Graham
did give everything to Protas, her will is "very nonspecific." The
rights to much of her work, they insist, have been transferred to the
center.</TE>
<TE>   Protas counters that other documents exist, substantiating his
claim.</TE>
<TE>   Why are the dancers performing before the dispute has been
resolved by the courts? "We're not trying to poke a fire in our
opponent's eye," said Marvin Preston, executive director of the
Graham Center. "The main reason is to keep the dancers dancing. They
need to keep dancing in order to remember the dances--to keep muscle
memory alive."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Averaging 20.4 million viewers, NBC's 75th anniversary show helped
the network win the Sunday night ratings race. It was the biggest
Sunday audience since the Olympics....The WB network has picked up 13
episodes of "Everwood," a series about a brain surgeon (Treat
Williams) who relocates to a small Colorado town after the death of
his wife....The X-Ecutioners and Coup show at the Glass House in
Pomona tonight has been canceled. It has not been rescheduled.</TE>

<HD>'Millie' Leads Tony Nominees</HD>
<DH>The show receives 11 nods, but the race for best musical
and other categories is open.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK PACHECO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>"Thoroughly Modern Millie," a musical based on the 1967 film about a
gold-digging flapper, captured the most nominations--11, including
nods for best musical, best actress and best actor--for the 2002 Tony
Awards.</LD>
<LD>   The nominees were announced Monday morning at Sardi's by Steven
Weber of "The Producers" and Jennifer Jason Leigh of "Proof."</LD>
<LD>   Unlike last year, when "The Producers" was favored to win in all
categories in which it was nominated, this year's race for best
musical is said to be the most competitive in years. A win is
important because it carries box-office clout.</LD>
<TE>   Competing against "Millie" is "Mamma Mia!," the ABBA tuner that
has become an international phenomenon; "Sweet Smell of Success," a
dark musical based on the 1957 movie about a demonic gossip
columnist; and "Urinetown," the quirky off-Broadway transfer
concerning the draconian measures of a drought-stricken town.</TE>
<TE>   "Urinetown," which premiered at the 1999 New York Fringe Festival,
received 10 nominations, while "Sweet Smell" garnered seven,
including two for stars John Lithgow and Brian D'Arcy. "Mamma Mia!"
received five nods (a touring production returns to L.A. this fall).</TE>
<TE>   "It's been an extraordinary voyage," said lyricist-composer Mark
Hollmann, nominee for "Urinetown," who with partner Greg Kotis began
writing the show in 1996. "Any number of things could've stopped us
along the way, but our lucky stars kept bringing us to new levels.
I'm glad there's space on Broadway for things that are a little
edgy."</TE>
<TE>   "Millie," which had its world premiere at the La Jolla Playhouse
and boasts Whoopi Goldberg as one of its producers, took a far more
conventional route to Broadway. Book writer Dick Scanlan, a nominee
for "Millie," got the idea for the show in 1988 and began work in
1992 with Richard Morris, the original screenwriter for the 1967
film, which starred Julie Andrews. Morris, who died in 1996, has been
posthumously nominated.</TE>
<TE>   "He was ornery and fiercely independent, but he'd be delighted
with the nominations," said Scanlan.</TE>
<TE>   Also nominated is Sutton Foster, the relative unknown who
originated the role of the title character in La Jolla.</TE>
<TE>   In the musical revival category, the Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine
musical "Into the Woods," which premiered at the Ahmanson Theatre
earlier this year, will compete against "Oklahoma!," the Royal
National production directed by Trevor Nunn and choreographed by
Susan Stroman.</TE>
<TE>   A lavish revival of the Rodgers and Hammerstein classic
"Oklahoma!" opened in March after a hugely successful run on London's
West End and was widely favored to dominate the Tonys. However, it
received only seven nominations, while "Into the Woods," which opened
on Broadway last week, received 10.</TE>
<TE>   "Morning's at Seven," a 1939 comedy by Paul Osborn, emerged as the
most nominated play of the season, with nine nominations, five of
which were in acting categories. It will compete for best revival of
a play with Arthur Miller's "The Crucible," Noel Coward's "Private
Lives" and the Michael Frayn farce "Noises Off."</TE>
<TE>   "Crucible" and "Private Lives," a London import, each brought in
six nominations, including nods for its respective stars, Liam Neeson
and Laura Linney, and Lindsay Duncan and Alan Rickman.</TE>
<TE>   In the best play category, Edward Albee's new "The Goat or Who Is
Sylvia?," about a man who falls in love with a goat, will compete
against "Fortune's Fool," a 150-year-old Russian melodrama by Ivan
Turgenev (ruled eligible in the category because the rarely seen work
had never played Broadway); "Metamorphoses," Mary Zimmerman's
irreverent take on Ovid myths that began as a university production;
and "Topdog/Underdog," a drama of warring brothers by Suzan-Lori
Parks that won the Pulitzer last month.</TE>
<TE>   Albee declared himself "delighted" to be taking on Turgenev and
Ovid. "I've competed with a lot worse people, who I won't name
because they usually win," said the playwright. "My plays usually win
in revival because by then people have figured out what it's about."</TE>
<TE>   While Mercedes Ruehl was nominated for her performance as the
long-suffering wife in the Albee play, Bill Pullman, who plays her
erring husband, was not. ("Maybe if he'd had an English accent he
would've been," Albee said.)</TE>
<TE>   This season's acting categories were very competitive, which led
to other omissions, such as Ian McKellen ("Dance of Death"), Chris
O'Donnell ("The Man Who Had All the Luck") and Kevin Bacon ("An
Almost Holy Picture").</TE>
<TE>   Most egregious to many insiders was the absence of George C. Wolfe
among the nominees for best direction of a play for "Topdog/
Underdog," though one of its stars, Jeffrey Wright, was nominated.
Wolfe's work on the drama was universally acclaimed and considered
key to the production's success.</TE>
<TE>   Less surprising was the shutout of "The Graduate," the
much-ballyhooed stage adaptation of the 1967 Mike Nichols film,
starring Kathleen Turner, Jason Biggs and Alicia Silverstone.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with huge advance sales of $5 million, "The Graduate" is in
better shape than its nominated counterparts, some of which are
struggling to stay afloat.</TE>
<TE>   Also overlooked in the best revival of a play category was Bernard
Pomerance's "The Elephant Man," the 1979 Tony and Pulitzer Prize
winner.</TE>
<TE>   Two of "The Elephant Man" stars, Billy Crudup and Kate Burton,
were nominated for their performances. Burton also was nominated for
her performance in the title role of Ibsen's "Hedda Gabler."</TE>
<TE>   The winners of the 2002 Tony Awards will be announced on June 2 in
a nationally televised broadcast on PBS and CBS from Radio City Music
Hall in New York.</TE>

Pacifica String Quartet. That future is already here, as demonstrated
by the three-part program sponsored by the Music Guild afternoon at
the University Synagogue in Brentwood.</LD>
<LD>   Formed in Los Angeles in 1996, the group is graced with depth and
unanimity that are all the more remarkable given that two of its
members--violinist Sibbi Bernhardsson and violist Masumi Per
Rostad--joined original members violinist Simin Ganatra and cellist
Brandon Vamos only within the last two years.</LD>
<LD>   Any of the three works, Haydn's Quartet in F, Opus 77, No. 2;
Mendelssohn's Quartet in A, Opus 13; and Beethoven's first
"Rasumovsky" quartet (Opus 59, No. 1) could provide abundant evidence
of the ensemble's subtlety, refinement and engagement. But
Mendelssohn's opus--composed, according to the program notes, when he
was 18 and in the flush of young love--turned out to be particularly
special.</LD>
<TE>   Inundated with pop culture images of raging hormones, we can
easily overlook the idealistic aspect of first (and not so first)
love. The Pacifica captured Mendelssohn's embodiment of that awesome,
urgent response to the beloved, from ardor to calm to emotional
quickening to jealously and turbulence. In their hands, the work
became as complex and gripping as a 19th century novel.</TE>
<TE>   The quartet members haven't forgotten their adolescence, and we're
all the richer for that.</TE>

<HD>Spectrum Shines With Vitality</HD>
<DH>Hit-and-run artistry rules in the series' latest
installment, featuring 15 pieces in less than two hours and
emphasizing commercial work.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The series Spectrum: Dance in L.A. continues to offer emerging local
choreographers and companies access to a young, enthusiastic audience
and the dance community as a whole a celebration of its own vitality.</LD>
<LD>   At the Ivar Theatre on Sunday, Spectrum #11 may have neglected
traditional world dance and overemphasized commercial work, but with
15 pieces in less than two hours, the program allowed no time for
creative self-indulgence or confusion. Hit-and-run artistry ruled,
and sometimes the results proved dazzling.</LD>
<LD>   Take "Cellove," Josie Walsh's (Myo Dance Company) wicked, witty
and technically demanding portrait of an artist obsessed with his
instrument and eventually overwhelmed by it. At once a parody of
ballet partnering conventions and an unorthodox classical showpiece,
it found accomplished interpreters in Claudia Velasco and,
especially, the charismatic Demian Boergadine.</LD>
<TE>   Equally obsessive in its own way, Brian Frette's commanding modern
dance solo "Stigmata" punctuated meditative and even lyrical passages
with sudden, unpredictable outbursts, notably high-speed backward
crawls and a number of punishing body slams to the floor.</TE>
<TE>   More subdued but remarkably fluent and expressive, Christine and
Nicole Baltes' (Jazz Spectrum Dance Company) modern dance solo "A New
Day" inventively physicalized female resilience through Nicole
Baltes' use of a chair as a spatial focus and partner.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes an otherwise ordinary piece grew memorable because of a
single component--Nalani Wilson's ravishing Hawaiian-style gestural
embellishments in her solo "In My Life," for example, or the gorgeous
liquid undulations by 13 women in Anna Djanbazian's (Djanbazian Dance
Company) "In the Garden of Soul."</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Kevin "Roscoe" Farnsworth's (Roscoe's Rascals) "Mr.
Zoot Suit" looked impressive whenever it stuck to Lindy Hop
partnering gambits, and Allan McCormick's (Synthesis Dance Company)
pop showpiece "Sadeness" capitalized effectively on his gymnastic
prowess, though it never topped the excitement of its opening image:
McCormick in a spectacular, contorted handstand with five women
clustered around him.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other pop choreographies, Kenji Yamaguchi's quintet
"Against the Wind" relied on a sense of atmosphere, infusions of
ballet bravura (not always well integrated) and a very versatile
cast, while Jessica Lynn's septet "Who Are We to Judge?" gained
impact from its sense of group solidarity.</TE>
<TE>   If you looked at this kind of work Sunday as an index to current
social attitudes, you'd have noticed lots of gender parity--men and
women used interchangeably in Jesse Abrescy and Arleen Flores'
hip-hop ensemble "Son of a Gun," for example, and even a male lifted
by a female in Cindera Che's multidisciplinary "Che Gelida Manina."</TE>
<TE>   Produced by Deborah Brockus and Daisy Kim of the Brockus Project
Dance Company, Spectrum #11 also included Brockus' duet "Jardin," a
homage to the old jazz-dance status quo in which a male existed to
lift, a woman to be lifted and they didn't need steps as long as the
former could keep the latter hoisted high above his head.</TE>
<TE>   Brockus also contributed "Dunes," in which three women gestured
and swayed atop a stage-filling cloth sculpture. The initial
impression proved striking, but the movement possibilities turned out
to be cruelly limited.</TE>
<TE>   Ellen Rosa's solo "Danza" and Nicole Dougherty's (Metropolitan
Ballet Company) ensemble "Kodo" completed the program.</TE>

<HD>Arthur Miller: Three Plays, Similar Theme</HD>
<DH>Fathers and sons mix it up in 'Death of a Salesman' at
Interact, 'All My Sons' at Actors Co-op and 'The Price' at the
Odyssey.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A father raises his two sons to bask in the promise of the 20th
century American dream. But the dream falls apart, accompanied by
aching guilt, bitter anger, searing recriminations.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, we're in Arthur Miller territory. And three small L.A.
theaters are exploring this particular corner of Millerland--the
father-and-two-sons plays.</LD>
<LD>   Interact Theatre is offering a wrenching production of Miller's
masterpiece, "Death of a Salesman." Actors Co-op approaches but
doesn't quite reach the same league with Miller's first major
success, "All My Sons." The Odyssey Theatre has taken on a later,
weaker play, "The Price," and hasn't found a way of making it seem
nearly as significant.</LD>
<TE>   Let's start at the top. "Death of a Salesman" is one of those rare
plays that can move audiences to tears in productions of radically
different sizes. One reason the staging at the Ahmanson Theatre in
2000 was thrilling was because it was so big. It was exciting to hear
the hushed silence of so many people hanging on every word that Brian
Dennehy spoke.</TE>
<TE>   Yet to see the same play in the intimacy of the Interact Theatre
offers equally compelling rewards. To be just a few feet away from
the hangdog face of Eddie Jones' Willy Loman lets you look deeply
into his eyes and witness the regret behind his brusque vocal
delivery. To be so close to the actors during their slashing
arguments makes you feel like a visiting relative who arrived just as
the family was cracking up.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the surfaces are photo-realistic. The element of
"Salesman" that raises it firmly above the other two plays is the
interpolation of flashbacks into Willy's final hours. These scenes
generally begin as sunny fantasies within Willy's mind but end with
intimations of his darker side.</TE>
<TE>   Director Anita Khanzadian, abetted by lighting designer J. Kent
Inasy, respects the almost surreal quality of these scenes. She
probably realized that in such close quarters, the actors obviously
won't look as young as their characters were in those earlier years,
so she uses these scenes to emphasize that something is amiss. The
seeds of future destruction are literally visible in these
reconstructions of the past.</TE>
<TE>   The entire cast is in top form. Besides Jones, the Lomans are
Marilyn McIntyre as the wife who walks the perilous line between
cheerleader and taskmaster, Don Fischer as the anguished wanderer
Biff and Thomas Vincent Kelly as Happy, the son who still believes
that the old illusions can come true. The smaller roles are equally
blessed. Thomas Buderwitz's set suggests how shrunken Willy's world
feels.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the suburban backyard of the war profiteer Joe Keller
in "All My Sons" should feel expansive. The worst thing about Kevin
R. Kelley's staging for Actors Co-op is that it's crammed into such a
tiny, low-ceilinged space that it's hard to appreciate Joe's
affluence--which ultimately is related to his guilt. The tree that
the Kellers planted in memory of their missing son is barely a twig.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, "All My Sons" packs a powerful punch even in these
reduced circumstances. Although it lacks the extra dimension that the
flashbacks bring to "Death of a Salesman," "All My Sons" is even more
cathartic in the sense that Joe Keller more fully understands his
tragedy by play's end than does Willy Loman.</TE>
<TE>   At Actors Co-op, David Schall's Joe appears a little too nervous
too early; he signals the man's coming collapse too soon. But by the
end, as he's assaulted by his enraged son, played by fiery John
Allsopp, Schall's terrified demeanor is a heartbreaking glimpse into
a man's contaminated soul.</TE>
<TE>   Bonnie Bailey-Reed's Kate Keller could be Linda Loman's
sister--pasting on a feverish smile for purposes of morale, then
turning stone-cold somber when the occasion demands it. Again, the
small roles are well-hewn.</TE>
<TE>   "The Price" suffers from the physical absence of the father. He's
long gone when his middle-age sons--a dutiful cop and a more
independent surgeon--meet to sell his belongings and rehash the past.
The play intentionally lacks the moral clarity of "All My Sons";
Miller was ambivalent about both sons' choices. This need not have
derailed the play, but it made it too easy for the conversation to go
around in circles. The absence of the father allows the conflict to
degenerate into virtual whining.</TE>
<TE>   The play's best character is an elderly antiques dealer who
bargains for the belongings. George Murdock is superb in the role, as
is Laurie O'Brien as the cop's impatient wife. Barry Primus is solid
as the cop, but Lyle Kessler's surgeon is monochromatic in both
voice--thin and high-pitched--and gesture; he thrusts his right arm
to his side so often that it seems a distracting tic rather than a
way of emphasizing a point. Anthony Caldarella directed on a
lustrously detailed set by Victoria Profitt.</TE>

<HD>'Nova' Takes On West's Wildfires</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Can we control the forces of nature?</LD>
<LD>   Based on the battles depicted in the "Nova" report "Fire Wars" (8
p.m., KCET, KVCR), the answer remains in doubt. Every year wildfires
scorch the American West, and armies of firefighters mobilize to save
threatened land and communities. Despite technological and strategic
advances, the war on wildfire has been as frustrating as the war on
drugs.</LD>
<LD>   "Nova" follows the men and women of an elite crew known as the
Arrowhead Hotshots during the ruinous summer of 2000, during which 6
million acres burned.</LD>
<TE>   The season started in Los Alamos, N.M., when a prescribed burn
designed to clear combustibles spread out of control. The Arrowheads
fought one blaze, in Clear Creek, Idaho, that raged for two months.
Harrowing footage shows the Arrowheads trapped by a crown of fire
that lighted trees like torches and sent tornadoes of flame skyward.</TE>
<TE>   This thoughtful and exhaustive--if at times exhausting--two-hour
show also looks at a century of fire-policy trial and error. The war
on wildfire dates from 1910, when millions of acres in the Rockies
burned and scores of firefighters died. Determined to avoid another
such tragedy, officials adopted a policy of "100% suppression,"
throwing all resources at wildfires.</TE>
<TE>   That policy led to overgrown terrain, and the deadly wildfires
continued. Ecologists also now recognize that many of our most
cherished landscapes depend on fire to recycle nutrients.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the prescribed burns now favored pose risks of their
own, and the smoke has spurred protests in many communities.</TE>
<TE>   As narrator Stacy Keach says, experts still are seeking "an
elusive balance." The war continues.</TE>

<HD>Seeing Spot Jump</HD>
<DH>Canines and their dedicated owners compete together in Dog
Agility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS RUBIN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As jets scream into the sky from nearby Burbank Airport and kids on
'blades whack pucks around an adjacent roller hockey rink, the
athletes and their trainers--dogs and humans--stream in to Ralph Foy
Park in Burbank before 8 a.m. There are Pomeranians, Great Danes,
Yorkshire terriers, Italian greyhounds; nurses, homemakers, high
school students, engineers.</LD>
<LD>   This is not some casual Saturday morning outing to the park. The
dogs have spent months to years training to do things like walk
across a teeter board and jump through a hoop with a signal from
their owners. The barking throng has been brought together for a
weekend of competition in a sport known as Dog Agility.</LD>
<LD>   It is nothing less than "America's fastest growing dog sport,"
says Karen Moureaux, who notes it has caught on in most states,
notably California, Illinois and Texas. Moureaux is at the Burbank
competition with Ravin, a female border collie, who with 282 other
dogs will compete this day--in tandem with their owners--as they run
a pair of obstacle courses and are judged on time and accuracy.</LD>
<TE>   There are other dog sports, from greyhound racing to sheepherding
and dogsledding. But this one is somehow more personal, more about
the connection between dog and dog's best friend. Dog Agility
competitions, launched nearly 20 years ago in England, were given
their start in Los Angeles about 13 years ago by a group including
Moureaux, for whom it has become a full-time job. Now, there is a
competition somewhere in the area virtually every weekend.</TE>
<TE>   As the teams arrive at Foy park, folding chairs and tent-like
structures are set up around the courses to create home bases in what
will be a two-day competition. As owners stretch to prepare
themselves and get their dogs warmed up or relaxed, depending on
breed and temperament, the event's organizers are busy setting up the
two courses: standard, and jumpers with weaves.</TE>
<TE>   The course--each has about 20 obstacles--is different for every
competition, so the human walks through in advance to learn it. Then
dog and human go through, with the human sprinting alongside the dog,
steering it through in proper order, and cheerleading. Classes are
determined by size of the dog and level of experience--beginning with
novice and graduating to open and excellent.</TE>
<TE>   Obstacles include jumps, tunnels (both collapsible and open, or
"pipe"), a tire to jump through, weave poles (think slalom), a teeter
board and an A-frame. It takes about 40 to 75 seconds to race through
the standard course, 25 to 45 for jumpers with weaves.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you walk this course?" exclaims one frustrated contestant
who, like many others, feels it's too tight, meaning the obstacles
are too close. "It's an extremely tight course made for a dog this
size," says Marilyn Bennett, holding her thumb and forefinger close
together. Her dog Shilo, an Australian shepherd, definitely doesn't
fit the description.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Shilo quickly knocks over a bar on her first jump and is
disqualified, but Bennett runs her through all the obstacles anyway.
Breathless at the end of the run, she takes the blame for the
mistake. "It was probably my fault," she pants. "It's usually the
handler's fault."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Szabo, a septuagenarian, walks the course, preparing for his
run with Csilla, his 5-year-old Belgian sheepdog. "This is a
difficult course," Szabo says in Hungarian-accented English. An
engineer who works with robotic systems and has been competing in Dog
Agility since 1988, Szabo is analytical: "You have to go for a clean
run or go for time. There's no way to do both today."</TE>
<TE>   Szabo walks through, studying the flow of the course. Numbered
cones indicate the route each dog must traverse, guided by his
master's voice and hand signals. No touching is allowed, but owners
point the way for their dogs, and many yell out the name of the next
obstacle: "Tunnel!"</TE>
<TE>   When their time comes, Szabo guides Csilla through the course.
Szabo runs along gamely, if not as quickly as some, but he's
efficient and methodical, and Csilla reaches the end of the course
without any mistakes. Her reward? A hunk of cheese, and a "Q," or
"qualifying" score and accompanying green ribbon.</TE>
<TE>   Rocky, an Australian shepherd, nabs first place on the standard
course with a flawless, speedy run, led by Rachel De La Torre. For
their efforts, they receive a coveted blue ribbon--and a squeak toy.
At 16, De La Torre is one of the youngest competitors but no less
enthusiastic than the others. "I compete at least twice a month," the
10th-grader says. Sometimes, school gets in the way, she admits. "I'd
rather do agility than homework." She is among those who aspire
eventually to compete in national and international events.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone has a successful run. Baldwin, the No. 1-ranked Puli
(Hungarian sheepdog) in the open category in the U.S., recently
graduated to excellent, a tougher division where even one mistake
means disqualification.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Hartzler plays with Baldwin before his run on the jumpers
with weaves course, revving him up. But during the run, Baldwin
scoots past a table where he's supposed to sit still for five
seconds, racing instead into a tunnel, disqualifying himself.
Breathless after the event, Hartzler tries to figure out what went
wrong. "Why'd he go through the tunnel?" she asks, as much to herself
as those around her. "I said, 'table.' Was my body off line?"</TE>
<TE>   Despite Baldwin's failure to qualify today at either event,
Hartzler maintains her enthusiasm for the sport.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Dog Agility can get addictive, says Hartzler, who
estimates she has spent as much as $7,000 on the sport over the last
two years and suffered a broken ankle while training Baldwin at home.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a drug," she says. "You become one with your dog. It's
a rush. When you and your dog are tuned in, it's like nothing you've
ever felt before."</TE>

<LD>The airplane hangar was crowded with luxury. Shimmering antique
jewelry, rare folk art, ancient Chinese artifacts and French Art Deco
furnishings transformed the cavernous structure into a labyrinthine
gallery. One guest made her way through the masses, squeezing past a
rare Edward Hopper and the first lady of California, Sharon Davis,
nearly elbowing the $14-million painting. A friend spotted her and
shouted: "You break it, you buy it!"</LD>
<LD>   A few steps away, designer Tracey Ross hovered near jeweler Neil
Lane's glass case, eyeing the vintage baubles priced in the hundreds
of thousands. "I've been wearing this piece for the last hour," she
said, touching her throat and pointing to a stunning necklace
encrusted with diamonds.</LD>
<LD>   Ross was among the hordes of rich and famous collectors and their
decorators who were lured to the Barker Hangar in Santa Monica on
Thursday night for a preview of the L.A. Antiques Show. The three-day
event raised nearly $900,000 for women's health programs at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.</LD>
<TE>   On the other side of the hangar, Texas art dealer Joel Cooner
congratulated himself on selling $9,000 worth of African artifacts in
two hours. "It's a good day's work," he said, chuckling. Furniture
dealer Anne Hauck embodied the essence of her Art Deco furnishings as
she stood tall with enviable posture, wearing a calf-length black
coat, a severe bob haircut and black-framed glasses. "Everybody is
looking for this," she said in a clipped German accent, pointing to
an elegant hand-painted armoire. "Everybody."</TE>
<TE>   A few booths down, another dealer, J. Mark Sublette, showed off
his rare Georgia O'Keeffe, priced at just under $1 million. Business
for Sublette was slow on Thursday, with promises of a big deal the
following day. "Diane Keaton called me to say she's coming by
tomorrow," he said. (Alas, no sale.)</TE>
<TE>   Keaton is a regular at the antiques show. Ross is credited with
bringing in a younger clientele this year, including Duran Duran
bassist-turned-actor John Taylor and his wife, fashion designer Gela
Nash-Taylor, actress Gina Gershon and singer Robbie Williams, among
others. "These people have money they might as well cultivate
themselves," she said. The show, Ross said, "is as New York as it's
going to get for L.A."</TE>
<TE>   Poses and Patter From Two Yogis</TE>
<TE>   When gurus to the stars Sharon Gannon and David Life visited the
Center for Yoga on Larchmont Boulevard last week, about 30 women and
20 men squatted on pink, green and blue mats to hear the word:
Jivamukti.</TE>
<TE>   Created by Gannon and Life, the talk-intensive yoga method, which
stresses spirituality and ethics as much as physicality, has
attracted a number of celebrity students, including Sting, Monica
Lewinsky, Donna Karan, Beastie Boy Mike D and Def Jam Records founder
Russell Simmons. (Simmons, a frequent visitor at Gannon and Life's
yoga center in New York, has long tried to get his friend Rev. Al
Sharpton to join, they said--so far, to no avail.)</TE>
<TE>   Wearing gray tights and a black tank top advertising Jivamukti
yoga, Life explains the couple's mission. Rather than build yoga
centers around the country, the two have focused on writing and
teaching, and they were in L.A. to promote their most recent book,
"Jivamukti Yoga." "Our dream was never to have the Starbucks of
yoga," Life says. They just want to spread the word. And his
appearance is full of words, each yoga pose the starting point for an
observation.</TE>
<TE>   As the group assumes the "cobbler's table"--torso like a tabletop,
balanced on hands and feet--Life asks: "What is my table set with? If
there's a big pot roast in the middle," adds the vegetarian, "it's
not good."The "blossoming lotus" occasions visions of harmony:
"Larchmont is going to become the vortex of world peace."The "night
sky," on the other hand, is a foray into the extraterrestrial. "You
all think all this stuff comes from India," Life says. "It's from
Egypt. It was channeled by the UFOs from outer space."</TE>
<TE>   A cell phone rings inside a black knapsack. "Every little cell
carries cosmic consciousness."</TE>
<TE>   The bodies in the room, including one in traditional Hasidic
dress, take the fish pose. "Fish are very sensitive creatures
....Eating seaweed, everybody can be happy," Life says. Then,
reaching a crescendo: "We can set the chickens free, we can liberate
the cows!"</TE>
<TE>   Time for meditation.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the cosmic vortex, someone sneezes. Outside, a construction
worker revs up his drill. A car starts up. A bird sings. Then,
silence.</TE>
<TE>   Life chants:</TE>

<LD>STILL LOVE IN STRANGE PLACES</LD>
<LD>   A Memoir</LD>
<LD>   By Beth Kephart</LD>
<TE>   W.W. Norton</TE>
<TE>   224 pages, $24.95</TE>
<TE>   "Words are the weights that hold our histories in place. They are
the stones that a family passes on, hand to hand, if the hands are
open, if the hearts are," writes Beth Kephart in "Still Love in
Strange Places," a prose-poem of a memoir focusing on her fascination
with her husband's native El Salvador. Though Kephart ("A Slant of
Sun") had little interest in that Central American country prior to
meeting her husband, Bill, her imagination was fired by Bill's tales
of his upbringing and his extended family.</TE>
<TE>   She is particularly interested in giving to their son Jeremy the
fully imagined world of his father's roots, and in doing so, writes
lovingly and thoughtfully. It is through stories, she finds, that we
reconcile and embrace our heritage.</TE>
<TE>   El Salvador's "prosperity and poverty and politics, its murders,
reprisals and grace all had tracers back to coffee," she suggests of
the strife-torn land and provides a fair amount of historical and
geographical background on the region. Her in-laws, who own large
coffee farms high in the mountainous jungles of El Salvador, are also
defined by the crop, and the family's coffee plantations make up the
vivid backdrop of the narrative. The tale moves gracefully between
Kephart's visits to El Salvador, with luscious scenes of day-to-day
existence on the coffee farms--portraits of beauty and awe on one
hand, danger and extreme poverty on the other--juxtaposed against the
life she shares with her husband and son in suburban Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   In creating scenes of her husband's land, Kephart relies as much
on her imagination as on facts, piecing together, for example,
numerous stories of her husband's grandfather, re-imagining for the
reader what his life may have been like. Don Alberto founded the
family farms and died before Kephart married into the clan, yet she
artfully joins the tales told by her husband and his Aunt Adela with
torn photographs and her own conceptions to construct a narrative,
admittedly closer to hagiography than biography, but fascinating
nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   Though the intent of the book seems to be to introduce readers to
the intrinsic beauty of El Salvador and its culture, a splendor
obscured in recent decades by violence and political unrest, its most
intriguing subtheme (and perhaps an unintended one) converges on
Kephart's seemingly uneasy relationship with her spouse.</TE>
<TE>   She writes of Bill as if his being born abroad makes him exotic
and unknowable. The longing she feels in the face of his
mysteriousness impels her story and forces her to dig deeper into his
past in order to possess a piece of him. "I want Bill and his
brothers ... to know more about their histories than they do ... I
persist. I ask. I supplement," she writes of this drive to know his
family better without addressing the deeper question of why?
Certainly, it's human to want to fully know one's spouse, to enter
his childhood, to hear stories of his life before you came on the
scene. The unequal nature of her drive, though, becomes apparent when
she acknowledges that he has no interest in knowing about her past.
"Years ago, Bill concluded that the suburbia of my youth was ...
benign," she writes, and thus, her stories were deemed neither
interesting nor worthy of exploration the way his life, in the wilds
of El Salvador, has captured her attention. A foreign land and
language clearly add a layer to what is unfathomable in another's
life, but they are not the only impediments to entering that life,
though Kephart writes as if they were.</TE>
<TE>   She photographs, documents, researches and questions his family
tree, becoming essentially the family historian. Meanwhile, the
reader detects the low flame of resentment burning, her exasperation
over his lack of interest in her personal history. "His stories have
become the habit with us--his childhood photos the ones I study. His
memories the ones I tap. He asks me little about where I come from
...." Yet Kephart refuses to confront this disparity. Prodding Bill
to ask about her own life, to wonder about her beginnings, her failed
efforts are tinged with guilt. "My facts do not disturb him .... He
is there, inside the land he left, and I am not there, I am nowhere
in his incubated memory .... I want to tell a single story. I want my
husband to look back and keep looking until he finds me inside the
things he loves.... " In many ways, this memoir seems designed to
fill that desire, to place the author within her husband's memories.</TE>
<TE>   As lush as the mountainous terrain it depicts, "Still Love" is a
poetic evocation of Salvadoran life, its magic and tragedies. The
book is also--by design or not--a sketch of the disparities in this
one cross-cultural marriage, and a sidelong view of how women's
stories have been silenced for eons.</TE>

<LD>This stone statue, carved about 1,200 years ago for a temple in
Thailand, represents Buddha, the spiritual leader of the Buddhist
religion. Buddhism started in India many centuries ago and has
millions of followers today throughout the world.</LD>
<LD>   Buddha, who was born Prince Siddhartha, left behind his wealthy
family and the world of material comforts to gain understanding of
the universe (this is called enlightenment).</LD>
<LD>   The sculptor who made this statue provides many clues to tell us
about Buddha. His long earlobes refer to his wealthy status as a
prince who wore heavy earrings. The "bump" on top of his head is not
part of a hairstyle, but is a raised part of his skull (called an
ushnisha). What looks like an indentation between Buddha's eyes was
once inlaid with a jewel to suggest a tuft of hair (the urna). All
these features remind us of Buddha's wisdom, power and goodness.</LD>
<TE>   Notice that Buddha has a big, broad smile. When and why do you
smile like that? Do you smile when you are happy? Happiness can
result from many different events, things, experiences and
interactions with people. It is a feeling that we enjoy and sometimes
work hard to achieve.</TE>
<TE>   For Buddhists, a life of peacefulness, quiet and meditation leads
to perfect happiness. Buddha taught that we should let go of desire
and attachment to material things. Buddhism's message is that
ultimate happiness comes only when we do not want anything at all.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Buddhists will observe Wesak, a religious festival
that celebrates Buddha's birth, death and enlightenment. In honor of
Buddha, his followers will make kind and generous gestures to all
people. This large statue of Buddha with its warm smile greets you at
the entrance of the Norton Simon Museum. You can see it and other art
from Southeast Asia, India and Europe. For more information, call
(626) 449-6840 or visit www.nortonsimon.org.</TE>

<HD>Dating in a Family Way</HD>
<DH>Avoid going out just because they're single and pregnant?
Not a chance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA ROSEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some men like the idea. They see the opportunity for an instant
family or love the perceived taboo of dating a pregnant woman. But
not all. Take the guy caught so off-guard when he got the news of his
date's pregnancy that he ruined a tablecloth:</LD>
<LD>   "Somehow 'Hi, I'm using a sperm bank' didn't seem like first-date
conversation, and our second date was a dinner party with several of
his friends," she said. Then her suitor went away on a business trip
for a few weeks. When he returned, he invited her out to a fancy
French restaurant and ordered a glass of wine. "I had a seltzer and
told him why I wasn't drinking--that I'd just found out I was
pregnant. He spit his merlot all over the table." When he recovered,
he gallantly wished her luck, paid for dinner and was never heard
from again.</LD>
<LD>   Not everyone spits up--or splits--when confronted with a pregnant
date, or the idea of dating while pregnant. In fact, as more single
women are making the express decision to have a child without a
permanent partner, the subject is increasingly in the open, which is
to say it's a topic on Web sites and a plot point on sitcoms.</LD>
<TE>   "If you're dating while you're pregnant, you have to have a sense
of humor about it," said Ariel Gore, single mother, creator of the
zine Hip Mama and author of "Hip Mama's Survival Guide." "People will
have interesting, intimate reactions to you as a mother. If you think
it's funny, that's great. If you freak out, it will make things
difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Dating, and all it implies--from dinner and a movie to
companionship and sexual intimacy--is certainly more complex for the
unattached pregnant woman. Safe sex concerns take on additional
significance even as worries about getting pregnant fly out the
window. Emotional attachments have deeper resonance for dater and
datee, and behavioral codes haven't yet been covered by Miss Manners.</TE>
<TE>   Television recently addressed the subject on two popular shows.
This season, developments with the characters of Miranda on "Sex and
the City" and Rachel on "Friends" (Cynthia Nixon and Jennifer
Aniston, respectively), led to both single women choosing to have
babies.</TE>
<TE>   Recent episodes further showed both characters overwhelmed by
heightened libidos--which is a side effect of pregnancy that many
women report experiencing. Miranda turned to a casual date and later
to the father-to-be, whom she was no longer seeing romantically, to
fulfill her sexual urges; Rachel was left to suffer it out alone.</TE>
<TE>   There is an underlying dilemma: In addition to the societal
pressures attending single motherhood (remember the flap 10 years ago
between then-veep Dan Quayle and fictional character Murphy Brown for
choosing to bear a child on her own?), there is the not-always
acknowledged reality that a pregnant woman and a sexual woman can
exist in the same person. In fact, those who work with pregnant
women, single and otherwise, estimate that half or more report
experiencing heightened libido during at least part of their
pregnancy.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question the hormones affect one's sexual feelings,"
said Jane Mattes, a psychotherapist who founded Single Mothers by
Choice after the birth of her son in 1981. It has grown from a small
networking organization into an international group with more than
2,000 members. (Her son, Eric, now 21, designed the Web site
singlemothersbychoice.com.) The organization features e-mail lists
where members can turn to each other with their concerns about
pregnancy and motherhood. Mattes said that in the middle trimester,
after the months of morning sickness and before the discomfort of
late pregnancy, many women say they are the most sexual they've ever
felt in their lives.</TE>
<TE>   The single pregnant woman who wants to date, said Anne Semans--who
is single, pregnant and dating--ends up having to be "publicly and
aggressively out there about [her] singlehood, because most people
assume you have a partner somewhere." Semans, who is co-author with
Cathy Winks of "The Mother's Guide to Sex," (Random House, 2000),
said pregnant women date for all different kinds of reasons. "A lot
of them just want to be held, touched, they want to have sex, they
want someone to pamper them," she said. "When you're not partnered,
it's very hard to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the women interviewed for this story have used online
dating services as a way to meet men who weren't put off by their
mother-to-be status. It was easier, they said, to let potential dates
know of their pregnancy via e-mail before meeting.</TE>
<TE>   One New York woman who belongs to Single Mothers by Choice said
she waited to tell her date about her pregnancy after they met. "It
was awkward all along, but he seemed to roll with it." As the
relationship progressed, however, he made it clear he could not see
himself in a long-term relationship with a woman with a child.  "This
started to bother me the more intimate we got sexually, and the more
confident I grew about the pregnancy," she said. They recently agreed
to stop dating.</TE>
<TE>   Sex without commitment can get complicated, especially for
pregnant women. "Every time someone has sex, a connection is made,
there's a certain kind of intimacy even if it's not emotionally
intimate, and it's hard for most people to keep things completely
casual even if they intend to," said Laura Berman, therapist and
co-director of the Female Sexual Medicine Center at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   During pregnancy, many woman feel particularly vulnerable and want
to protect themselves emotionally when looking for that kind of
intimacy. Based on her experience with patients, Berman hypothesizes
that if someone were to do a study, they would find the majority of
pregnant women who were sexually active were doing so with someone
they already knew because of those elements of safety and support.
Many single pregnant women choose not to date all, but those who do
often speak of reconnecting with old beaus or trusted friends for
more intimate sexual involvements. "He was 100% safe physically and
emotionally," said an L.A.-based business consultant of the former
boyfriend she started seeing again during her pregnancy. As a bonus,
sex with him was far better than it had ever been when they had gone
out years earlier. "He'd never been with a pregnant woman, and the
whole thing--both my body and the idea of it--was a huge turn-on for
him."</TE>
<TE>   Another Californian speaks of getting together with a good friend
whenever he came into town. She notes that "it was wonderful to be
with a man, particularly this very dear old friend." She had been
experiencing an extremely heightened sexual desire, but didn't want
to date anyone she didn't already know well.</TE>
<TE>   That choice coincides with some basic medical advice offered to
women by doctors concerned about the mother-to-be and the
child-to-be: practice safe sex, and make sure you know your partner
and his sexual history--you can't afford to risk exposure to sexually
transmitted diseases.</TE>
<TE>   The warnings and cautionary tales are moot  for some women, who
report that their interest in sex declined during pregnancy. And some
who were still interested in sex said that other concerns outweighed
those desires.</TE>
<TE>   Randie Golkin of Orange County, a member of Single Mothers by
Choice, said that she enjoyed dating a man she met while pregnant but
didn't become sexually intimate, to his dismay. She was sympathetic
to his feelings but said that when choosing to become a single
mother, "you go through an awful lot of trouble to get pregnant; you
don't want to blow it on one night of fun. So I didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Vanessa Stefanelli, dating in San Francisco, also decided not to
be sexually active. "The stakes were much too high at that point for
me to get involved in a casual relationship." As the first pregnant
woman in her circle of friends, she found herself the object of great
interest and curiosity. "Men always wanted to feed me, which was
great," she said. "At the time, I was working 60 hours a week and
going to school. It was so nice to come home to some guy at my door
with flowers saying, 'Hey, can I take you out to dinner?' I was,
like, sure you can. I milked it," she said, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   Her experience isn't universal: Some men seem oblivious to the
idea of a child on the way.</TE>
<TE>   Nicole, a Hip Mama zine and hipmama.com subscriber from Denver,
said she dated a man for four months who kept forgetting she was
pregnant. He wanted to take her out to loud, raucous parties. "We
would constantly have to reroute that; I didn't want to party and be
around that stuff any more," she said. "I wanted to do more PG-rated
dates, Beaver Cleaver kinds of things, like picnics."</TE>
<TE>   Semans said it's an odd thing to have to repeatedly remind someone
that you're pregnant. "You don't want to be focusing on it all the
time, but it invariably comes up. No 10-mile hikes!" Meeting at a bar
for a few drinks isn't a good option, nor is hanging out at a smoky
club. Ditto going out for sushi--pregnant women are advised not to
eat raw fish.</TE>
<TE>   On the other end of the spectrum from the guys who can't seem to
remember the pregnancy, are the men looking for an "instant" family.</TE>
<TE>   "In some ways your appeal as a damsel in distress goes up," said
Gore of Hip Mama. "People think they're going to save you.''</TE>
<TE>   Erica Kaplan of Portland can attest to the insta-family
experience. While pregnant, she dated a man she didn't think was that
interested in her pregnancy one way or another--until he took her to
his grandparents' house at Christmastime. "I realized maybe
three-quarters of the way through the visit that they thought I was
carrying his baby." Her date hadn't told them otherwise. He acted
proprietary in public as well, apparently liking the idea that he
looked like a married man with a pregnant wife, she recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Stefanelli noticed that she was attracting people who assumed that
she wanted a partner/father for the baby. "Suddenly I had all these
guys who wanted to get married and buy a cocker spaniel and a station
wagon," she said, "which was weird, because I had never necessarily
attracted those types of men before."</TE>
<TE>   None of the women interviewed found permanent partners during
their pregnancies, but then, that wasn't the point. As one explains,
her unborn child was the focus of her life: "Dating was certainly a
nice extra, but it was never a priority to me at that time."</TE>
<TE>   Many said they found that just as the decision to have a child on
their own was empowering, so was dating while pregnant. They found
themselves being more straightforward with men and learning how to
clearly ask for what they did and didn't want, without the usual
dating games. "I think that translates really well into other areas,"
Semans said. "Once you figure out what you need and how to ask for
it, you're going to be better off in any kind of relationship."</TE>
<TE>   At some point during pregnancy, the whole idea of dating--and just
about everything else save perhaps nesting--seems to lose its appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Kaplan recalls having the energy to get dressed to the nines for a
New Year's Eve outing but falling asleep in her living room while
waiting for her date to arrive.</TE>
<TE>   "He knocked on my door for almost 20 minutes before I woke up,"
she said, "and I couldn't go anywhere, I was so exhausted. That was
the last time we tried to go out."</TE>

<LD>It's one of those memories that should probably be relegated to a
file labeled "Good Old Days."</LD>
<LD>   Reader Jeff Marlin recalls when he was a boy about the age of
Richard Pena, the 15-year-old from El Cajon who ran off last week
with his science teacher. Marlin and his kid brother had their own
off-campus liaisons with a teacher 22 years ago, but they involved
trips to Dodger games, not rendezvous at Las Vegas motels.</LD>
<LD>   "My brother and I loved going to Dodger games, but neither of us
could drive," Marlin recalled. "So my mother would drive us to Dodger
Stadium, sit in the car in the parking lot until the game ended, then
drive us home. Then I came up with an idea. My math teacher and I hit
it off real well ... and I knew he liked sports. So I asked him if,
in exchange for us buying him a ticket to the game, he would drive us
to and from Dodger Stadium." The teacher talked to Marlin's mother
and the deal was made. "We ended up attending a bunch of games in the
company of an adult who looked after us ... and one of the nicest men
I've ever known," Marlin said.</LD>
<TE>   I doubt that Richard will feel the way Marlin does 20 years from
now, when he looks back on his escapade with Tanya Hadden, the
33-year-old teacher who was arrested and charged with one count each
of a lewd act upon a child and child stealing (she still faces
charges in Las Vegas of kidnapping and "statutory sexual seduction")
after the two spent three days on the run in the wake of a police
investigation over whether Hadden had furnished alcohol to minors.
And I know Richard's parents won't feel the same sense of gratitude
that Marlin's mother felt, knowing her boys were in their teacher's
care. The Penas may still be asking the question parents seem unable
to avoid these days, as we confront accounts of teachers having sex
with students, priests molesting altar boys, police officers
assaulting women in their patrol cars.</TE>
<TE>   Priests, teachers, police officers ... whom can we trust anymore?</TE>
<TE>   None of this is new, of course. Everyone can probably remember a
teacher or two who was inappropriately chummy, whose behavior with
one student or another kept the gossip mill running.</TE>
<TE>   An old friend, reminiscing recently, confided that he smoked his
first joint in junior high, courtesy of our seventh-grade algebra
teacher. And I recall accepting a ride home in eighth grade from our
glee club teacher, then having to scramble out of his car after he
slid his arm along my seat and caressed my shoulder. As kids, we
never told anyone. These were our teachers, after all, and we didn't
feel we had the right to complain. And perhaps we understood--as we
should still today--that they were the exception, not the rule.</TE>
<TE>   Now I hear stories from my daughters, of behavior by teachers that
is, at least, inappropriate and, at times, profane. Teachers who
touch too much, tell off-color jokes, seem to reserve special
treatment for the best-looking girls ... or boys.</TE>
<TE>   There are the sensational stories that catch our eye: The male and
female Pasadena math teachers accused of having sex with a pair of
girls for two years; the San Fernando Valley special-education
teacher who had a month-long affair with a 16-year-old boy from her
class; and the infamous Mary Kay LeTourneau, who is now in prison,
after having two children with her sixth-grader paramour.</TE>
<TE>   But there is little reliable data on how often teachers and
students become sexually involved. Anecdotal evidence, however,
suggests it happens far more than we'd like to admit.</TE>
<TE>   In a survey of North Carolina high school students and graduates
10 years ago, a shocking 13.5% said they'd had sexual intercourse
with a teacher. Other studies put the number much lower, suggesting
that about 15% of teenage students are subjected to harassment or
abuse--ranging from sexual acts to leering--by their teachers.</TE>
<TE>   The most comprehensive study--a survey of 2,000 high school
students by the American Assn. of University Women last year--found
that 38% said they'd been sexually harassed by teachers or other
school employees. That's frighteningly high, but it's five percentage
points down from a similar survey in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   That may be progress, but it's not worth celebrating.</TE>
<TE>   Hadden told a reporter from jail last week that she and Richard
were not lovers, merely best friends, soul mates. He was an A-student
in her class, they began hanging out together, and she started
thinking "with my heart ... not my head," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers who pursue inappropriate relationships with their
students tend to be immature and self-centered, experts say. Some are
using sex as a means of power and control; others crave attention and
are trying to fill an emotional void. They may overidentify with
their young students, and seek acceptance and approval so desperately
that they ignore the boundary between grown-up and child.</TE>
<TE>   I suppose that's no surprise. Boundaries between children and
adults are fuzzier everywhere these days. Moms dress like their
daughters, dads sport earrings and blast rap CDs. Our children's
friends call us by our first names; our kids' teachers and coaches
use the kind of language my parents used to say belonged in the
streets.</TE>
<TE>   But the good news is our children are also becoming less
malleable, less afraid of authority. They're more willing to speak
out, we're more likely to believe them and everyone is more aware of
the damage that can be done. Students abused by their teachers, just
like kids abused by priests, suffer from a sense of betrayal and
confusion that can haunt them for life.</TE>
<TE>   We need to realize that it's not enough to pass along to our kids
the timeworn conventional advice: Don't let anyone do anything to you
that makes you feel uncomfortable. Many young people are vulnerable
enough that contact with a teacher does not make them feel
uncomfortable, but special, beautiful, a cut above ordinary
classmates. Better to tell them that it's just plain wrong. That no
matter how good it makes you feel, some boundaries are not meant to
be crossed. That your teacher is not your friend, your lover or your
soul mate. That an A in science does not a romance make.</TE>

long, braided pigtails and honk like a duck. Boody always made me
laugh.</LD>
<LD>   I walked over to the counter and shouted, "Watcha making today?"</LD>
<LD>   "One of your favorites," Boody sang. "Jellies!"</LD>
<TE>   Her silvery hair made curves around the small, yellow visor she
wore. I watched her skinny arms lift the bags of flour and sugar over
to the mixing machine. She added the ingredients and flipped on the
switch. The machine spun the powdery mixture into a thick, white
batter.</TE>
<TE>   Boody looked over at me and said, "Tell me a story, kid."</TE>
<TE>   I told her about how our class rat got loose and chased my teacher
around the room the day before.</TE>
<TE>   Boody laughed and laughed. "You're funny, Lucy," she said, turning
off the mixer. Boody walked slowly as she carried the heavy steel
bowl to the counter.</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks," I said, grinning. I loved the way Boody listened to me.</TE>
<TE>   My mom and dad owned a restaurant, and I spent hours there just
sitting at a booth, waiting for them to finish working. But here at
the doughnut shop, Boody made time for me. She made me feel like I
was special.</TE>
<TE>   Boody began to stretch out the dough onto three metal sheets. She
grabbed her tool and cut 24 round shapes.</TE>
<TE>   After the dough had risen, Boody dropped the gooey circles into
the bubbling oil of the deep fryer. The round doughnuts sizzled and
floated to the top. Boody used metal grabbers to pluck them out of
the oil.</TE>
<TE>   She looked over at me again through the glass. "Are you bored?"</TE>
<TE>   I shrugged my shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   I could see a little grin come over her face. "Come here, Lucy.

<HD>Bellying Up for a Beer With James Joyce</HD>
<DH>UCLA grad students, faculty and celebrities gather for a
271/2-hour fund-raising reading of 'Ulysses.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For a late-night literary pub crawl, it was remarkably clear-headed.
Elizabeth Graham had just bellied up to the "bar" and launched into
the "Sirens" section, some erudite blarney about Leopold Bloom, Big
Ben Dollard and a "candlestick melodeon oozing maggoty blowbags,"
whatever that means. Shadows loomed in the trees and doorways
surrounding UCLA's Rolfe Hall Sculpture Courtyard, and the nippy air
had a touch of old Eire about it.</LD>
<LD>   It was almost midnight, nearly 12 hours into a marathon reading of
"Ulysses," James Joyce's madly inventive 1922 novel, and so far a
raucous band of UCLA graduate students, faculty stalwarts and a
Hollywood celebrity or two were managing to keep the meandering story
on its wayward track. But stately, plump Kevin Patrick Cooney (OK,
he's really kinda laid-back and svelte) knew that in the wee small
hours to come it would be hard to stay focused on the epic task at
hand. Where's Jerry Lewis when you need him?</LD>
<LD>   "Once we get to 7 a.m. we've pretty much made it, because there's
a coffee shift that comes in," said Cooney, a third-year grad student
and chair of the event. Gazing around at the dozen or so people who
hadn't nodded off, he added, "This is a pretty good audience for this
time of night."</LD>
<TE>   As things turned out, Cooney's scholarly confidence wasn't
misplaced. The Thursday-into-Friday round-robin recitation went off
with nary a glitch, as scores of readers plowed through Joyce's
740-page Modernist masterpiece in a snappy 27 1/2 hours.</TE>
<TE>   That's roughly the amount of time that elapses during "Ulysses"
itself, an episodic distillation of the events of a single day in
Dublin--June 16, 1904--as played out in the lives of three main
characters: Stephen Dedalus, a smarty-pants young teacher; Leopold
Bloom, a bumbling Jewish ad salesman; and Molly Bloom, his lusty,
acerbic spouse.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, whether spoken out loud or lying flat on the printed page,
reading "Ulysses" has never been for the faint of heart or the short
of patience. For generations, Joyce's alternately bawdy and
transcendent book has been confounding scholars and baffling
undergraduates, some of whom in despair have pronounced its title
"Useless."</TE>
<TE>   "Joyce himself was famous for saying that he'd put so many puzzles
and conundrums in it that it would keep scholars busy for centuries,"
said UCLA English professor Jack Kolb, who gave a talk on "Ulysses"
on the first day of the marathon. "It took the remainder of the 20th
century to recognize the achievement of 'Ulysses,' that it was
coherent, that it did hold together, and that it wasn't, as some
early critics said, 'unreadable.'"</TE>
<TE>   Now in its seventh year, the fund-raising marathon was expected to
net about $15,000 to support scholarships and study grants for UCLA
grad students in English. In years past, the annual event has tackled
such size XL works as "Moby-Dick," "Bleak House" and "Gravity's
Rainbow." Over the years, the marathons have raised more than $60,000
for graduate activities and generated plenty of their own folklore.</TE>
<TE>   There was the time the lawn sprinklers accidentally went off in
the middle of "Bleak House," dousing the audience along with a
painted backdrop of London houses that had been loaned by Paramount
studios. "It woke everybody up, believe me," said Annie Reynoso, a
Hollywood producer and coordinator of the Friends of English, an
alumni support group.</TE>
<TE>   Another year, a young man and woman, apparently overcome by the
anarchic ethos of "Gravity's Rainbow," went streaking nude through
the courtyard--and straight into a bicycle cop. They barely managed
to throw their clothes back on before backup officers arrived on the
scene.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing that sensational occurred at this year's marathon, which
got underway at noon on Thursday. But there were some memorable
moments. The first was a cameo appearance by actor Elliott Gould, one
of a half-dozen celebrity readers, who took the opening crack at
Chapter 1. "Isn't the sea what Algy calls it: a grey sweet mother?
The snotgreen sea. The scrotumtightening sea. Epi oinopa ponton, "
Gould intoned in a fine stage-Irish brogue.</TE>
<TE>   To lend authenticity, the reader's podium was decked out as a
replica of Barney Kiernan's, the bar that figures prominently in the
novel, complete with fake beer taps and a large mirror. To one side
hung an oversized map of turn-of-the-century Dublin, showing all the
key landmarks of Joyce's book: Martello Tower, the Bloom residence at
7 Eccles Street, and so on. Portraits of the artist as a young man
stared out from a nearby pair of trees.</TE>
<TE>   Asked later whether he considered "Ulysses" to be the 20th
century's greatest novel, as many scholars claim, Gould pondered for
a moment. "I would select 'Charlotte's Web,'" he said finally. "E.B.
White was a nice guy."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe he wasn't joking, because "Ulysses," with its
stream-of-consciousness interior monologues, obscure historical
references and parodies of various literary genres, can be a bit of a
slog--despite its author's high-minded intentions. In telescoping the
action of the book and elevating its characters to mythic levels,
Joyce was recasting (tongue in cheek) everyday modern life as an
epic. Well-versed readers would also recognize strains of Homer's 8th
century BC narrative poem "The Odyssey," in which Ulysses, a Greek
hero of the Trojan War, undergoes 10 years of tribulations before
reuniting with his long-suffering wife, Penelope. "It's the old
boy-gets-girl story," said grad student Sean Silver, who was sporting
a tweedy knit cap and raffish wool vest for the occasion.</TE>
<TE>   Though the marathon was broken into roughly 15-minute reading
segments, some participants lasted only a fraction of that time.
Several readers confessed they'd never made it through the entire
novel. Journalist Lawrence Grobel, who read immediately after his
friend Gould, used a phonetic cheat sheet to help him with the Latin
phrases sprinkled throughout the book. Actor David Birney admitted
that he couldn't make much of the book when he read it for the first
time in college. Reading it aloud, Birney said, made it easier to
glimpse the story behind Joyce's pyrotechnic style. "When you read it
on the page you're experiencing only the ghost of the author's
voice," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet actor Peter Dennis, who said he'd never seen a page of the
book before, confirmed its oral suppleness with a note-perfect
sight-reading. "It's the magic of the words and the rhythm of the
words," he observed. "Joyce is rhythm."</TE>
<TE>   Among those listening on a small emerald-green patch of grass were
a group of sixth-graders from Gael Blair Academy, a private Pasadena
school. "There are funny things. I caught myself laughing," said
Alexandra Haffner, 12. A few feet away her teacher, Nick Love,
sprawled on the turf, following along in his book. "We read the whole
'Odyssey,' the Fagles translation, most of Virgil, most of the
'Aeneid,' a lot of Ovid," said Love, who'd doffed his shoes, socks
and black leather jacket. "I think they're not paying much attention,
but I think something soaks in."</TE>
<TE>   As the afternoon ebbed and the audience dwindled to a couple dozen
intrepid listeners, the reading took on the feel of a college dorm
bull session-cum-performance art piece. Bottles of Harp beer
materialized. Sweaters, wool coats and sleeping bags were hauled out.
Votive candles were lighted and placed around the courtyard,
enhancing the ceremonial feel. The smell of clove cigarettes mingled
with ribald stage directions and other unsolicited advice from the
crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "C'mon baby, work it!" yelled grad student Peter Terpinski as his
fellow student Elizabeth Graham, back for another 15-minute round,
waded through one of Joyce's interminable lists. Graham obligingly
whipped off her scarf, then her topcoat, without skipping a beat.</TE>
<TE>   Terpinski whooped and hoisted his bottle of Foster's in salute.
"That's one of the things that's great about Joyce," he said. "With
all his disgusting frat-boy humor, he never really grows up, despite
his erudition. Joyce just loves to [mess] around. The other thing I
admire about this book is Joyce's stamina. There's this boundless
energy."</TE>
<TE>   Somehow, the students' energy held up as Friday morning dawned and
the campus slowly started coming back to life. By 3 in the afternoon
they were heading down the home stretch, as Irish actress and L.A.
resident Bairbre Dowling, the last of 215 readers, took the podium to
cap off Molly Bloom's famous soliloquy. "I was a Flower of the
mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian
girls," Dowling read, her warm, husky voice dissolving the ornery
syntax into sensual poetry.</TE>
<TE>   Recapping the long day's journey, English department chairman
Thomas Wortham noted that, "the extravagance of staying up all night
is something one remembers having done in sweet retrospect."</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe next year we'll just get a book on tape and play it and
everyone can go home," he joked.</TE>
<TE>   All in all that seemed unlikely--as unlikely as the thought that
one perfect summer day in Los Angeles could be spent remembering a
summer day in Dublin long, long ago.</TE>

<HD>Hollywood's Star Yet to Shine</HD>
<DH>Mega complex at Highland fails to turn around district as
lots sit empty and office vacancies rise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite a booming night life and a bright long-term outlook, the
Hollywood district's much- touted turnaround has slowed in the face
of a sluggish economy and the complexities and politics of urban
development.</LD>
<LD>   The Hollywood office market, for example, is among one of the
weakest in the region, with a vacancy rate hovering around 25% and
some newly renovated buildings sitting empty. At the corner of Sunset
Boulevard and Vine Street, giant piles of dirt and debris mark the
spot of one of the area's many long-delayed retail developments.</LD>
<LD>   Even the giant Hollywood &amp; Highland shopping center, which was to
have heralded Hollywood's comeback, has struggled as foreign tourists
remain scarce and locals have been put off by parking rates that run
as high as $10 a visit.</LD>
<TE>   Many boosters concede that pinning Hollywood's comeback on the
opening of a single mega project such as the 6-month-old Hollywood &amp;
Highland development was naive. It will take several more years
before private and public redevelopment efforts begin to pay off with
a broader and long-lasting Hollywood recovery, real estate and urban
development specialists say.</TE>
<TE>   "Hollywood had suffered for so long that people wanted one
project, with the snap of a finger, to turn Hollywood back to the
height of its heyday," said developer Larry Bond, who is building a
housing and retail project in the area. "That's simply not reality."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood has gone through this before. In the early 1990s,
several massive redevelopment projects were expected to turn the area
around but didn't materialize after the region sank into a deep
recession.</TE>
<TE>   Urban renewal "just takes a long time, a lot of money, and then
these economic factors come up and blindside you," said broker John
Tronson of Ramsey-Schilling Commercial Real Estate.</TE>
<TE>   Determined business and civic leaders as well as residents have
made great strides in cleaning up blight and crime and attracting
trendy nightclubs, bars, restaurants and edgy retailers. In recent
years, developers seeking to turn the often tawdry and tattered
center of Hollywood into an urban playground have built or unveiled
plans for nearly $1 billion in major projects ranging from Hollywood
&amp; Highland to renovation of the landmark Cinerama Dome. Developer
Legacy Partners announced plans in February to build housing and a
hotel at the Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street subway stop.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I go down Hollywood Boulevard I see new storefronts,"
said John McCoy, who oversees the Hollywood area for the Los Angeles
Community Redevelopment Agency. "We are seeing significant
development of smaller properties."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood has a long way to go, though, before it can approach the
commercial and economic success of New York's rejuvenated Times
Square or even Old Pasadena and Santa Monica's Third Street
Promenade. Visitors strolling Hollywood Boulevard will be
disappointed if they expect to find a wide selection of high-end
national retailers, boutiques and restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   "You still have a lot of people in the Greater L.A. community who
are not convinced that Hollywood is back," said economist Jack Kyser
of the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood's largest office building owner, Meringoff Equities,
last year went from having virtually no vacancies and a waiting list
of potential tenants to 200,000 square feet of empty space--about
one-third of the company's Hollywood portfolio. Meringoff has seen
leasing pick up lately, but that was partly because it offered
tenants up to six months of free rent at one of its largest
properties.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been pretty bad," said Rob Langer, managing partner of
Meringoff. "A lot of the tenants just turned in their keys and went
into bankruptcy."</TE>
<TE>   Problems in the Hollywood office market were compounded by the
renovation of several older office buildings in expectation of a boom
that has yet to materialize.</TE>
<TE>   "We had all this new space coming online just as the market dried
up," said Leron Gubler, president of the Hollywood Chamber of
Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, many of Hollywood's major retail projects have yet to
break ground years after being announced.</TE>
<TE>   It was five years ago that Beverly Hills-based Regent Properties
and city officials unveiled plans for a major retail and
entertainment center and renovation of the historic James A.
Doolittle Theatre as part of a development at Sunset Boulevard and
Vine Street.</TE>
<TE>   Regent scrapped the Sunset &amp; Vine project a few years later after
a dispute over parking with a neighboring property owner and movie
theater operators pulled out of the project. Bond's group took over
Sunset &amp; Vine--which had been reduced in scope and now included
apartments--and planned to break ground last fall.</TE>
<TE>   After a lengthy review of the unique mixed-use project by city
inspectors, Bond has postponed construction until next month and
plans to open the first part of the center by the end of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   On Hollywood Boulevard, CIM Group, known for successful urban
retail developments in Santa Monica and Pasadena, has had mixed
results from the numerous properties it purchased in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Although CIM has leased up most of an office building, the firm is
as much as two years behind on its retail projects, some of which
have been hamstrung by the shakeout in the movie theater business as
well as the economic slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that the pace and the amount of leasing has obviously
gone a little slower on the retail front," said John S. Given, senior
vice president of development for CIM. But, "I think the prospects
are still very, very good. We are not terribly concerned."</TE>
<TE>   Given and others remain confident about the area despite the
misfortunes of Hollywood &amp; Highland, the giant that was to symbolize
Hollywood's comeback. Instead, only six months after opening, a few
stores have already pulled out of the development and its owner,
Canadian real estate firm TrizecHahn Corp., is giving some tenants
rent breaks to keep them in place and has reduced the value of the
approximately $600-million project by 40%.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood &amp; Highland officials said they expect conditions to
improve as tourism rebounds and a recent decision to lower parking
prices attracts more residents.</TE>

<HD>Jurors Picked as Andersen Trial Gets Underway</HD>
<DH>Courts: Each side unfolds its strategy during the selection
process. Opening arguments slated today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Attorneys selected a federal jury Monday to determine whether
accounting giant Arthur Andersen obstructed justice by shredding
documents from its audit of Enron Corp. last year.</LD>
<LD>   The selection of 12 jurors and four alternates came at the end of
the first day of a trial that could determine the fate of the
89-year-old accounting firm. The case also marks a crucial opening
move in the Justice Department's broader investigation of the
meltdown last year of Houston-based Enron.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors and Andersen attorneys began unfolding their
strategies during the selection process, defining the dimensions of
the legal skirmishes that lie ahead. Prosecutors asked U.S. District
Judge Melinda Harmon for permission to introduce Andersen's previous
run-ins with regulators as a motive for the alleged obstruction.
Harmon said she would rule today on the motion, which is being
opposed by Andersen.</LD>
<TE>   The panel of nine men and seven women was chosen from a pool of
more than 100 prospective jurors who squeezed into an 11th-floor
courtroom here.</TE>
<TE>   In questions to the jury pool, the two sides took markedly
different approaches and squared off over divergent views of document
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Matt Friedrich, in polite but formal tones,
quizzed the jurors about whether any of them had made a "mistake" at
work, asking whether any had ever destroyed documents to keep them
from authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Rusty Hardin, Andersen's lead attorney, struck a far more
conversational tone.</TE>
<TE>   "Why do you think he asked you that?" Hardin said of the
destruction question. "Once you throw that skunk into the jury box,
it's hard to take it out."</TE>
<TE>   Hardin pressed jurors to agree that companies often shred
unnecessary documents for legitimate reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Each side also introduced some digs at the other's case.
Prosecutors, for example, told jurors that the notion that only a few
employees destroyed papers isn't a valid defense, while Andersen's
team took pains--even putting up placards on an easel--to suggest
that the Justice Department had to prove several technical elements
to win a conviction under the obstruction statute.</TE>
<TE>   The selection process underscored the effect Enron's collapse has
had on the Houston marketplace. Of the 106 prospective jurors, about
20 told the court they knew people who worked for the fallen
energy-trading giant. Other jurors said they remained "angry" about
the financial fallout from the demise of the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the two sides are expected to present their opening
arguments today. Prosecutors plan to call their first witnesses,
including at least one Securities and Exchange Commission official.
The Justice Department's star witness, ex-Andersen partner David
Duncan, is expected to testify this week. Duncan has pleaded guilty
to obstruction of justice and is cooperating with the federal
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Also Monday, Andersen reached a new $217-million agreement to
settle civil cases stemming from the collapse of the Baptist
Foundation of Arizona, which lost $570 million belonging to 13,000
mostly elderly investors.</TE>
<TE>   On March 29, the accounting firm backed out of another
$217-million settlement after saying its insurance carrier, Hamilton,
Bermuda-based Professional Services Insurance Co., was unable to pay
it.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, attorneys said all the pending cases would be resolved
in court. The Baptist Foundation's lawsuit went to trial April 29.
Under the new settlement, Andersen must make an initial payment of
$11 million by June 4, then pay off the rest in installments by Oct.
25.</TE>

<HD>Providian to Shed an Additional 2,600 Jobs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Troubled credit card issuer Providian Financial Corp. said Monday
that it expected to eliminate 2,600 more jobs as a new management
team continues to dig out from loan losses that nearly buried the
company last year. The plan was revealed after the San Francisco firm
reported a first-quarter profit of $10 million, or 3 cents a share, a
96% drop from $230.5 million, or 81 cents, a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   If not for a series of one-time gains and losses recorded in the
first quarter, Providian said, it would have made $6.8 million, or 2
cents a share. The results outstripped the consensus estimate among
analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call of a loss of 6 cents
per share.</LD>
<LD>   Before the company announced its results Monday, Providian's
shares declined 25 cents to close at $6.35 on the New York Stock
Exchange. The shares surged by 71 cents in after-hours trading.</LD>
<TE>   Other earnings from California firms, excluding one-time items:</TE>
<TE>   Chicago Pizza &amp; Brewery Inc., a Huntington Beach restaurant
operator, reported net income for the first quarter of $736,000, or 6
cents a share, down 4% from the $763,000, or 10 cents, posted a year
ago. Revenue increased 13% to $17.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Global Outdoors Inc. reported net income of $507,937 or 9 cents a
share, compared with $14,796 or 0 cents per share a year ago. The
Temecula-based operator of the Outdoor Channel on cable television
said revenue was up 26% to $4.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Panavision Inc. reported a net loss of $3.3 million or 38 cents a
share, compared with a loss of $1.4 million, or 15 cents a share, a
year ago. Revenue for the Woodland Hills-based maker of cameras for
the movie industry was $45.6 million, down 15% from a year ago.</TE>

<HD>2 More Small-Stock Funds Closing</HD>
<DH>Mutuals: Successes have given managers more money to invest
than they can handle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The advisors of two popular small-stock mutual funds said Monday they
will close them to new investors, the latest in a series of closures
affecting one of the market's few profitable sectors this year.</LD>
<LD>   Boston-based Fidelity Investments said its Fidelity Low-Priced
Stock Fund won't accept any new investors for six months starting May
16, while Chicago-based Harris Associates said its Oakmark
International Small Cap Fund is closing indefinitely starting Friday.
Existing shareholders will be able to continue investing money in
both funds.</LD>
<LD>   The problem is too much of a good thing: The funds' success is
attracting more money than the managers can invest prudently, the
companies say. Fidelity Low-Priced Stock is up 10.3% this year while
Oakmark International Small Cap is up 15.5%.</LD>
<TE>   Smaller stocks have held up far better than larger ones during the
bear market of the last two years. So far in 2002, the Standard &amp;
Poor's small-cap 600 index has gained 8.5% and the S&amp;P mid-cap 400 is
up 3.7%, while the large-cap S&amp;P 500 is down 8.3%.</TE>
<TE>   Net inflows and appreciation have combined to swell assets of
small-cap equity funds by $64 billion since the market's September
lows, to a total of $244 billion, said strategist Thomas McManus at
Banc of America Securities in New York, noting that small-cap value
funds have been especially hot. Inflows measure purchases minus
redemptions.</TE>
<TE>   Hot small-cap funds that have closed in recent months include
Buffalo Small Cap Fund, Wasatch Core Growth and Franklin MicroCap
Value.</TE>
<TE>   Fidelity's closing will give manager Joel Tillinghast time to
invest the cash pile that poured in as the fund beat 89% of its
small-cap value peers in the last 12 months, according to Morningstar
Inc. Fidelity Low-Priced Stock grew to $15.7 billion as of March 31
from $6.8 billion on Dec. 31, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "While a portion of the increase is due to appreciation of the
fund's holdings, Low-Priced Stock also has experienced very heavy
investor inflows, and its cash position rose to 19% by the end of
March," said Abigail Johnson, chief of Fidelity's money-management
arm. The fund focuses on stocks selling below $35 a share.</TE>
<TE>   Manager David Herro, whose Oakmark International Small Cap had
$324 million in assets as of March 31, offered a similar explanation:
"Limiting asset growth allows us to remain true to the fund's
mandate--to invest in small-cap companies based outside of the
U.S.--and to maintain investment flexibility."</TE>
<TE>   For existing shareholders, such closures can be beneficial.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the fund industry has learned the hard way that it's
better to close a fund earlier rather than later," Kinnel said.</TE>
<TE>   Putnam Funds, American Century Investments and AIM Capital
Management are among the families that have been quicker to close
their funds in the last two years, he said. Over the years asset
bloat has led many small-cap funds to sluggish returns or forced a
change in their investment style.</TE>
<TE>   For investors with a long-term horizon, a fund's reopening is
probably a better time to buy than when it closes, Kinnel said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you've been in the market for a while and you've only just
discovered small-cap stocks, you may be coming late to the party," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, investors have plenty of standout small-cap funds to
pick from, Kinnel said.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 517 small-cap funds rated four or five stars by
Morningstar, or above average based on performance in recent years,
452 are open to new investors. Among small-cap funds favored by
Morningstar analysts: Royce Total Return, Third Avenue Value, William
Blair Small Cap Growth and RS Diversified Growth.</TE>

<HD>Record Sales of Condos in 1st Quarter</HD>
<DH>Housing: Low mortgage rates and mild weather spur purchases
of such units and cooperatively owned apartments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sales of U.S. condominiums and cooperatively owned apartments rose
17% to a record in the first quarter, as low mortgage rates and mild
weather spurred purchases, according to the National Assn. of
Realtors.</LD>
<LD>   Sales rose to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 838,000 units
from 719,000 in the fourth quarter, said David Lereah, chief
economist for the Washington-based trade group. The previous record
was 773,000 in the third quarter, he said.</LD>
<LD>   The record came as the 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 6.97%,
compared with 7.01% a year earlier, according to Freddie Mac. The
average U.S. temperature was 37.4 degrees Fahrenheit, compared with
36.9 degrees a year earlier, according to the National Climatic Data
Center.</LD>
<TE>   "We've had unseasonably mild weather throughout the United States,
and that, combined with the low mortgage rates, made for a strong
first-quarter market," Lereah said.</TE>
<TE>   The median price for condominiums was $135,300, compared with a
single-family home median price of $150,900, Lereah said. Condominium
prices appreciated at almost double the pace of single-family homes,
rising 15% from a year earlier, compared with an 8% gain for
single-family homes.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeing higher demand for condos from the two market
extremes--the empty-nesters in their peak earning years who are
selling their big houses, and the first-time buyers who are just
starting out," Lereah said.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of existing homes also rose during the first quarter to an
annual rate of 5.78 million. The total, which is 8.5% ahead of the
same time last year, is the largest sales volume for any quarter on
record, the realtor's group said.</TE>

<HD>McQuary Resigns EarthLink Post</HD>
<DH>Tech: Announcement that president is leaving job for
personal reasons sends Internet firm's shares down 11% to $7.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>EarthLink Inc. said Monday that President Mike McQuary resigned for
personal reasons.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement came only weeks after the Internet service
provider posted a wider-than-expected first-quarter loss.</LD>
<LD>   The move jolted investors, sending shares of the Atlanta-based
company down 11%, or 87 cents, to $7 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.</LD>
<TE>   "The stock is off sharply because it is a shock of an announcement
but as people filter through the announcement and realize there's not
another coming later and it is what it is--McQuary leaving because
his job was done and done very well--the stock should rebound," said
Frank Gristina, analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, who has a
"buy" rating on the stock.</TE>
<TE>   Youssef Squali, a FAC Equities analyst who also rates EarthLink a
"buy," said McQuary's resignation "as far as we can tell, is driven
by both personal reasons--he recently [had] triplets--as well as
professional ones, as EarthLink has been moving toward a less
top-heavy management structure."</TE>
<TE>   The company is not searching to fill his position, leaving Chief
Executive Garry Betty to assume McQuary's day-to-day
responsibilities, a company spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   McQuary came on board when EarthLink merged in early 2000 with
rival Internet company MindSpring, where he was the chief operating
officer.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts said McQuary's resignation suggested that the
integration of MindSpring and EarthLink was finally complete.</TE>
<TE>   McQuary also resigned as an EarthLink board member.</TE>
<TE>   He will contribute to special projects for CEO Betty and
EarthLink.</TE>

<HD>American Trans Air Alleges Hotwire.com's Ads Deceive</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James F. Peltz</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>American Trans Air on Monday accused online travel agency Hotwire.com
of using misleading and deceptive radio advertising that ATA claims
puts the airline in a poor light as a travel option. Hotwire said it
stands behind the ads.</LD>
<LD>   ATA alleged that Hotwire's ads quote bogus sample fares for ATA
that are intended to show that ATA's prices are relatively high and
that suggest the carrier is a "no-name airline" even though ATA is
the nation's 10th largest carrier. Based in Indianapolis, ATA serves
Los Angeles International Airport and is a major carrier serving
Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   The ads at issue involve consumers taking the Hotwire Travel
Challenge, in which they first get a fare from another travel agency
and then compare it with Hotwire's fares. In one, a consumer wants to
fly to Boston and is quoted a round-trip ATA fare of $586 on
Expedia.com, then gets a much cheaper price using Hotwire on an
airline that's not identified.</LD>
<TE>   ATA complained that because Hotwire doesn't indicate the
originating city for the flight, a listener in Chicago might think
the fare applies to a Chicago-Boston flight, when in fact "that's
totally not true," ATA spokeswoman Angela Thomas said. The quoted ATA
price is thus deceptive, she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Hotwire defended its ads. "All the fares are actual," and the
firm doesn't identify the originating city so as not to suggest "this
is a guaranteed fare that will always be found on the site,"
spokeswoman Amy Bohutinsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Hotwire, based in San Francisco, was formed two years ago by six
other major airlines and the investment firm Texas Pacific Group.</TE>

<LD>A top official at the Export-Import Bank offered his assistance to

company was careening toward bankruptcy, newly released documents
show.</LD>
<LD>   "As I read the newspapers day in and day out, I know that these
must be trying times for you and your family," wrote Eduardo Aguirre,
who at the time was awaiting confirmation as vice chairman of the
Export-Import Bank, an agency that helps U.S. companies expand
overseas. The Houston banker was nominated to the post by President
Bush.</LD>
<LD>   "Please remember that I value our friendship and that I'm only as
close as the phone if there is anything I can do for you," according
to the e-mail, obtained by The Times under a Freedom of Information
Act request.</LD>
<TE>   The federal agency has provided $650 million in loans and loan
guarantees to Enron-related projects overseas since 1993. About $515
million is still outstanding.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the e-mail, Aguirre was serving as an advisor to
the bank as he awaited Senate confirmation. A bank spokeswoman said
Aguirre's e-mail was of a personal nature, unrelated to the loans.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a personal relationship with Ken Lay," bank spokeswoman
Cheryl Crispen said. "It was not related to bank business."</TE>
<TE>   Enron executives also served on the bank's advisory board,
documents show.</TE>
<TE>   Contacts between Enron executives and Bush administration
officials have been the subject of numerous government inquiries
since the beginning of the year, when it was revealed that Lay
reached out to U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Commerce
Secretary Don Evans as his energy company was about to collapse.</TE>
<TE>   There has been no evidence that administration officials offered
any assistance to the company, which was a major Bush campaign
contributor.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department recently ordered the Export-Import Bank to
preserve all records related to Enron.</TE>
<TE>   A similar U.S. agency, the Overseas Private Investment Corp., is
investigating whether Enron misrepresented its finances in obtaining
loans for several projects.</TE>
<TE>   Crispen said the bank is cooperating in the investigation, but
officials are optimistic that the bank's Enron-related loans--which
are separate from the company's bankruptcy filing--will remain in
good standing.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), ranking member on the Senate
Finance Committee, one of several committees investigating Enron,
suggested Monday that Aquirre should distance himself from
Enron-related inquiries.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any reason to believe that Eduardo Aguirre's
friendship with Kenneth Lay is inhibiting the Ex-Im Bank's disclosure
of its dealings with Enron," Grassley said in a statement.
"Nonetheless, it's appropriate for Mr. Aguirre to revisit whether he
should limit his involvement in investigative matters regarding Enron
to avoid leaving any appearance of bias toward the company."</TE>

<HD>Profit Doubts Send Stocks Down Again</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Nasdaq closes below 1,600 for the first time
since October on concern over economy and corporate earnings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stock prices plunged again Monday on worries about the economy and
corporate profits, driving the Nasdaq composite index to its first
close below 1,600 since early October.</LD>
<LD>   "Investors are trying to figure out whether Wall Street is a game
of confidence or a confidence game," said Al Goldman, chief market
strategist for A.G. Edwards in St. Louis. "There is confidence in the
economy, but confidence in financial statements and Wall Street is
waning."</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 198.59 points to 9,808.04,
nearly a 2% drop. The Standard and Poor's 500 index ebbed 20.76
points, or 1.9%, to 1,052.67, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq
composite index fell 34.55 points, or 2.1%, to 1,578.48--pushing its
year-to-date loss to 19.1%.</LD>
<TE>   Losers swamped winners by 2 to 1 on Nasdaq and the New York Stock
Exchange. The selling intensified as the day wore on and the major
averages closed at or near their lows for the session. On the bright
side, the selling came on relatively weak volume.</TE>
<TE>   It was the third straight session in which Nasdaq's loss has
approached 2% or greater, and the 13th time in the last 16 trading
days the widely followed tech barometer has closed in the red.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened today was a continuation of what happened last
week," said Gerald Appel, president of Signalert in Great Neck, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Tech stocks have been weighing on the market as investors fret
that capital spending on technology won't pick up any time soon. On
Monday, bellwethers such as IBM, down $5.78 to $76, Microsoft, off 94
cents to $48.62, and Sun Microsystems, down 69 cents to $6.08, all
lost ground. A key index of semiconductor stocks slumped 1.5% and the
Amex index of telecom shares fell 3.3% to a new 52-week low.</TE>
<TE>   Appel believes the S&amp;P index could fall an additional 10% and that
even the brightest lights in this market are likely to get crushed
along the way. Indeed, he expects small-cap value stocks--the one
sector that's held up fairly well--to tumble in coming months.</TE>
<TE>   "When the strongest sectors get hit, that's when the decline
usually ends," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Appel doesn't expect any serious rally attempts until June or July
when second-quarter earnings begin to roll in. But if those earnings
prove as disappointing as first-quarter earnings, the market could
continue to spiral downward.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no way of predicting this thing, and I don't know that
anyone does," he said. "But the market appears to be saying that
earnings are not likely to increase enough to support today's
valuations."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, while this year's biggest market hits were largely caused
by big dramas--the scandals involving Enron, Arthur Andersen and
Merrill Lynch--Monday's sell-off was spurred by fundamentals, said
Esther Berger, managing director of Berger &amp; Associates in Beverly
Hills.</TE>
<TE>   "Today was sound reasoning versus hysteria," she said. "There is
widespread and genuine concern that corporate profits are not going
to be particularly strong, that we could have a recovery without
profitability."</TE>
<TE>   Berger said her firm is maintaining about 20% of its assets in
cash, believing that today's market prices still are too high for
most stocks.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a shopping list of stocks that we want to own, but we
believe we'll be able to own them at slightly more attractive prices
if we're patient," she said. "I would not exit the market stage left.
But the economic climate is not what it was two or three years ago,
and it's not going to be for some time."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Monday's light volume was due in part to investors
sitting on the sidelines in advance of today's Federal Reserve policy
meeting. The central bank is expected to stand pat on interest rates
because the evidence of a recovery by the U.S. economy is still
spotty and there are few signs of inflation.</TE>
<TE>   In other markets, yields on longer-term Treasury securities rose
as the government prepared its biggest quarterly bond sale since
1999. The dollar rose against the yen. Gold prices slipped.</TE>
<TE>   * Oil shares pushed the market lower after Iraq said it will
resume daily oil exports after a monthlong embargo and crude prices
dropped 50 cents to $26.12 in New York trading. ExxonMobil dropped
$1.34 to $39.25, dragging on the blue-chip Dow. Oil driller
Transocean Sedco sank $2.64 to $36.01. The oil and gas index had the
biggest percentage loss in the S&amp;P 500 index, dropping 6.0%.</TE>
<TE>   * Hewlett-Packard, trading on the NYSE under the new stock symbol
HPQ, rose 78 cents to $18.22 in the first day of trading since the
company completed its acquisition of Compaq Computer.</TE>
<TE>   * Cisco Systems shed 25 cents to close at $12.89 on Nasdaq,
erasing earlier gains. Analysts expect the Web gear giant to triple
last year's weak results as the technology bellwether's reliance on
large customers outside of the telecom industry helped it weather the
meltdown in spending by telephone companies.</TE>

<HD>Toyota May Build 2nd Mexico Plant</HD>
<DH>Autos: Factory would be in addition to a Baja facility
breaking ground next month, government officials say. Company says
plans are not final.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AGUASCALIENTES, Mexico</DL>
<LD>Japanese auto giant Toyota Motor Corp. is seeking to build a second
major auto manufacturing factory in Mexico to add to the Baja
California plant that will start construction next month, government
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Top state and federal officials who asked not to be named said the
second Mexican factory would make vehicles for the U.S. and Mexican
markets, receive $120 million in investment to start and cover a
minimum of 375 acres.</LD>
<LD>   Several states are vying for the plant, including Aguascalientes,
Jalisco, Guanajuato and San Luis Potosi.</LD>
<TE>   Already home to a giant facility operated by Nissan Motor Co. and
Renault, Aguascalientes has high hopes of snagging Toyota.</TE>
<TE>   The project shows that Toyota is serious about supplying the North
American market from nearby factories rather than with distant
exports. Toyota has the largest U.S. market share--10.3% year to
date--of any foreign auto maker and is growing quickly, said Jeff
Schuster, an analyst with J.D. Power &amp; Associates in Troy, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really part of the overall expansion that continues from
Toyota in North America," said Schuster, who is Power's director of
hemispheric forecasting. "Toyota's plants are running at capacity or
close to capacity."</TE>
<TE>   The factory site, which probably won't be announced for several
months, would be Toyota's second manufacturing venture in Mexico. The
auto maker will break ground next month on a factory southeast of
Tijuana on more than 715 acres.</TE>
<TE>   The Baja plant, due to begin operations in 2004, will start by
providing parts to a Tacoma truck assembly line at the Fremont,
Calif., plant that Toyota co-owns with General Motors Corp. But
industry and government officials expect the Baja facility to
graduate to full vehicle assembly, probably for pickups.</TE>
<TE>   A Mexican federal official involved in negotiations with Toyota
said he expected the auto giant to announce at the groundbreaking
that "more than a dozen" auto suppliers will follow Toyota to the
Baja site.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota's Baja facility will bring at least 1,000 jobs to the area
and ignite what Baja California officials hope is a higher level of
industrial activity to replace the light assembly plants called
maquiladoras whose numbers have decreased in the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about a second Mexico factory, spokeswoman Barbara McDaniel
of Toyota Motor Manufacturing North America in Erlanger, Ky., said:
"Nothing has been finalized yet. We have been talking about the
potential for something additional in Mexico, but nothing is decided
at this point."</TE>
<TE>   The second plant would be located more toward the center of Mexico
and closer to principal north-south highway and rail transportation
arteries to supply the U.S. and Mexican markets with mainstream
models.</TE>
<TE>   Although Toyota's U.S. market share has been steadily climbing
since 1995, sales took a big leap last year with its share of sales
rising to 10.15% of all vehicles sold from 9.3% the year before,
according to J.D. Power figures. Leading the growth are truck sales.</TE>
<TE>   After announcing the Baja project in January, Toyota called
officials of several Mexican states to assure them that "Toyota will
choose another site" for a second manufacturing facility, said a top
official with the Aguascalientes state government.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to supplying the U.S. market, Toyota also is
interested in establishing a strong presence in Mexico's domestic
market, the official said. A recent study by auto consultants A.T.
Kearney of Mexico City showed that there is ample room for new-car
sales growth, based on income and relatively light ownership levels.</TE>
<TE>   After an absence of more than 20 years, Toyota last month returned
to the Mexican new-car market by opening half a dozen dealerships in
large cities to sell Camry and Corolla sedans.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the Fremont plant, Toyota's North American
factories are located in Princeton, Ind.; Cambridge, Canada; and
Georgetown, Ky.</TE>

<HD>Telefonica Buys 65% of Wireless Provider Pegaso</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Purchase ends Qualcomm's money-losing foray into
Mexico's highly competitive market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Spanish giant Telefonica has bought control of Mexican wireless
telephone company Pegaso, ending the money-losing foray by San
Diego-based Qualcomm Inc. and its offshoot Leap Wireless
International Inc. into Mexico's highly competitive market.</LD>
<LD>   In acquiring 65% of Pegaso and access to its 1 million clients
concentrated in and around the capital, Telefonica accomplishes its
goal of expanding its coverage area from northern Mexico into this
dense metropolitan area, where more than one-fifth of all Mexicans
live.</LD>
<LD>   Adding to the 1.2 million customers it already has, Telefonica
becomes Mexico's second-largest cell phone company.</LD>
<TE>   But it still ranks far behind leader America Movil, the wireless
spinoff of Telefonos de Mexico whose Telcel brand has upward of 18
million customers.</TE>
<TE>   Telefonica is paying $87 million for stock owned by several equity
investors including Leap Wireless, Qualcomm, Sprint PCS Group, Nissho
Iwai Corp. and investment fund LAIF.</TE>
<TE>   It also is assuming 65% of Pegaso's outstanding $1.25-billion
debt, about half of which is owed to Qualcomm, according to recent
government filings.</TE>
<TE>   Qualcomm and Leap Wireless, which was spun off by Qualcomm in
1998, are exiting from a market that proved much more difficult than
expected. They and their partners hoped Pegaso would become a major
competitor to Telcel, but they ran into problems early on.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of building out Pegaso's coverage proved to be much
greater than expected against a competitor such as Telcel, whose
market share has increased to 80% from 70% since Pegaso was launched
in 1998, said Bryan Prohm, senior analyst at Gartner Dataquest in
Raleigh, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   "Telcel's advantages are brand, legacy, distribution, history.
Everything you can think of," Prohm said. The preference of Mexican
consumers for prepaid service has meant much smaller revenue streams
than service providers had expected, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The upshot is that the Pegaso partners have lost enormous sums.
Although Leap Wireless will receive $33 million in cash for its
Pegaso stock, it has written off some $120 million in Pegaso
investment.</TE>
<TE>   According to its recent filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Qualcomm lists some $700 million in loans to Pegaso, some
of which are in technical default.</TE>
<TE>   The company has not charged off any of the debt as losses but late
last year stopped booking loan interest as revenue, Qualcomm
treasurer Dick Grannis said Monday. He would not comment on whether
loan write-offs are forthcoming now that the long-awaited sale has
closed.</TE>
<TE>   Leap Wireless spokesman Dan Pegg said the sale frees the company
to concentrate on its rapidly expanding U.S. wireless business called
Cricket, which has 1.4 million customers in 20 states.</TE>
<TE>   Telefonica already is Latin America's second-largest wireless
operation, with units in eight countries and 17 million customers,
more than any company in the hemisphere except America Movil.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Telefonica bought a foothold in Mexico's cell phone
market by acquiring controlling interest in four regional wireless
telephone operations from Motorola Inc. for $1.8 billion in
Telefonica stock.</TE>
<TE>   Those four comprise a service area stretching from Baja California
to the Gulf of Mexico.</TE>

<HD>Mexico Taps Oil Reserve Fund to Cover Deficit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mexico tapped deeply into its $840-million reserve fund of oil
proceeds in the first quarter to cover costs as tax increases failed
to meet expectations and government spending rose.</LD>
<LD>   Mexico withdrew from the fund for the first time since it was
created in 2000 as the first-quarter budget deficit widened after the
government overestimated the country's growth prospects and its
ability to collect new taxes. Mexico had reported a surplus in the
first quarter each year since 1990.</LD>
<LD>   The government pulled $726 million from its $840-million Petroleum
Revenue Stabilization Fund, which was set up to provide the country
with a financing cushion after oil sales soared in 1999, the Finance
Ministry said.</LD>
<TE>   The use of the fund underlines the difficulties President Vicente
Fox is having in diminishing Mexico's reliance on oil revenue as its
spending gap widens. His tax increase proposal was derailed by the
opposition-controlled Congress last year, and analysts say he may be
forced to attempt new spending cuts to shore up finances.</TE>
<TE>   "There will definitely have to be some corrections on problems we
didn't foresee," said Manuel Minjares, a lower-house deputy from the
president's National Action Party who served on the congressional tax
commission.</TE>
<TE>   Total tax revenue in the first quarter rose 8% to $20 billion.
Still, the increase missed government estimates by $1.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The shortfall occurred as gross domestic product shrank 1.6%
during the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The government had expected the economy to recover from a
recession that began in late 2000, and it increased spending by 1.8%
from the same period last year to spur a revival.</TE>
<TE>   "The changes to the tax structure weren't substantive," said
Lawrence Krohn, chief economist for Latin America at ING Barings
Corp. "Combine that with a weak economy, and you get a tax
disappointment."</TE>
<TE>   Collection also fell short as attempts to raise revenue by taxing
leather goods, sports cars and jewelry backfired. The government
collected $23 million from the luxury tax, or 10% of what was
promised when tax legislation was passed last year. Fox was forced to
exempt Mexico's border states from the tax as consumers left the
country to buy goods in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Already, the government has announced plans to cut spending by $1
billion this year. Economists said more cuts may be needed to
maintain the government's target deficit of 0.65% of GDP.</TE>

<HD>TRW Opening Its Books to Northrop</HD>
<DH>Aerospace: Analysts say the compromise indicates TRW may
not have a rival bidder as it has implied.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>TRW Inc. agreed Monday to share detailed financial information with
Northrop Grumman Corp., ending weeks of acrimony and moving Northrop
one step closer to acquiring TRW on more friendly terms.</LD>
<LD>   In the latest twist to a $6.7-billion bid that has been marked by
increasing hostility, Century City-based Northrop said it had signed
a confidentiality agreement that would allow it to conduct due
diligence of TRW's financial documents.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement, terms of which had been a point of contention since
Northrop first launched the bid in February, was signed just hours
before Northrop was scheduled to announce whether it would proceed
with its offer.</LD>
<TE>   In seeking confidential financial documents, Northrop officials
are particularly interested in internal revenue projections for TRW's
classified programs, such as spy satellites and other weapons systems
that may have gotten a boost since Sept. 11. It also wants to verify
cost-reduction projections and whether there are any "change of
control" restrictions placed on TRW products that are often signed
with key customers.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the move by both companies to reach the last-minute
compromise signaled the possibility that Northrop could boost its
offer once again and that TRW may not have a rival bidder as its
officials have recently implied.</TE>
<TE>   "Last week, it became apparent to the rest of the world that there
is no other bidder out there," said Paul H. Nisbet, defense analyst
for JSA Research Inc. "Over the weekend, TRW came to the realization
that if [Northrop Chairman] Kent Kresa didn't extend the bid there
could have been quite a drop in TRW stock price."</TE>
<TE>   On the New York Stock Exchange, TRW shares rose 6 cents to $55.06,
while Northrop shares fell $2.75 to $119.63 on concerns that the
company would raise its bid price, making a deal potentially more
expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop raised its offer from $47 a share to $53 a share last
month as Kresa suggested that the bid could rise if the company found
"hidden value" during due diligence. TRW, which also makes aircraft
and automotive parts, is one of the last major defense contractors to
have avoided the industry consolidation wave of the last decade. TRW
directors have rejected both Northrop offers and have instead
proposed breaking up the company by itself.</TE>
<TE>   "We are pleased that we have reached a mutually acceptable
agreement with Northrop," TRW Chairman Philip A. Odeen said. "We are
confident that each of these avenues can deliver value to TRW
shareholders in excess of Northrop's $53-per-share offer."</TE>
<TE>   Northrop officials declined to comment, but sources familiar with
the deal said that Al Myers, the company's top official for mergers
and acquisitions, flew to Cleveland on Monday afternoon with a
contingent of lawyers and financial advisors to begin reviewing TRW's
nonpublic records.</TE>
<TE>   Until Monday, Northrop and TRW officials could not come to terms
over a portion of the confidentiality agreement known as the
standstill, which would have precluded Northrop from making another
bid for a certain period of time if talks collapsed. TRW wanted a
three-year standstill agreement, but Northrop sought a 75-day
provision.</TE>
<TE>   Early Monday, TRW and Northrop agreed to a compromise that reduced
the standstill period to about five months, sources familiar with the
discussions said.</TE>

<HD>State Deal Adds to Oracle's List of Woes</HD>
<DH>Software: The outcry over the $95-million contract is just
one of the firm's many headaches.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL LIEDTKE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The political flap over software giant Oracle Corp.'s $95-million
contract with the California government represents another headache
for a company already smarting from a sales slump, stiffer
competition and a three-year low in its stock price.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not a catastrophic event, but when you are already operating
in a difficult environment the last thing you need is more
difficulty," said industry analyst Mark Verbeck of ThinkEquity
Partners.</LD>
<LD>   Just how much the outcry over the deal hurts the world's
second-largest software company probably won't be known until state
Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer and the Legislature complete an investigation
into the circumstances leading up to the controversial contract.</LD>
<TE>   Lockyer and lawmakers are looking into whether a $25,000 political
contribution made by Oracle to Gov. Gray Davis' campaign influenced
his administration's decision to buy the company's database software
at a time the company was scrambling to drum up sales. A state
auditor criticized the deal as a waste of state money.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle has denied any wrongdoing and offered to cancel the deal if
it and its business partners can reverse the financial steps already
taken to carry out the six-year contract. Davis wants out of the
contract.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle easily can afford to refund the money. The $95-million
contract represented less than 1% of the company's $10.9 billion in
revenue during its fiscal year ended in May 2001--the period when the
state signed the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle probably is most concerned with how the furor will affect
its past and future sales to government agencies, a key market for
the company, said Sam Singer, a San Francisco public relations
representative specializing in corporate crisis management.</TE>
<TE>   The fallout from the California contract might make government
decision makers more cautious about dealing with Oracle in the future
and lead the company's own sales representatives to behave less
aggressively, Verbeck said.</TE>
<TE>   A more circumspect approach could open the door for Oracle's
biggest rivals in the database market, IBM Corp. and Microsoft Corp.,
to lure away customers.</TE>
<TE>   The company's shares fell for the fifth consecutive session on
Nasdaq on Monday, shedding 21 cents, to close at $8.22.</TE>

<HD>Peregrine Execs Quit as Probe Begins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Peregrine Systems Inc. disclosed Monday that it launched an internal
investigation into "potential accounting inaccuracies" involving up
to $100 million in revenue and that its two top executives resigned.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement sent shares of the San Diego software maker
plunging 65% and came a month after it fired accounting firm Arthur
Andersen as its auditor.</LD>
<LD>   The new auditor, KPMG, came across the irregularities during a
year-end review, said John Moores, who became Peregrine's chairman on
Monday. The amount in question represents nearly 20% of Peregrine's
2001 revenue of $564.6 million. The transactions in question occurred
in fiscal 2001 and 2002.</LD>
<TE>   Peregrine has notified the Securities and Exchange Commission of
the situation, said Moores, who owns the San Diego Padres baseball
team.</TE>
<TE>   "These transactions were recorded initially as revenue ... and may
have been written off in later quarters," Moores said in a conference
call. He declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Moores did not say which company executives, or how many, were
leading the investigation or when it would be completed.</TE>
<TE>   Chairman and Chief Executive Steve Gardner, who had been with the
company since its 1997 initial public offering, and Chief Financial
Officer Matt Gless resigned Monday. They could not be reached for
comment. Fred Gerson, who is finance chief of the Padres, was named
acting CFO.</TE>
<TE>   Peregrine was the second- biggest percentage loser on Nasdaq,
falling $1.68 to 89 cents in heavy trading Monday. The stock fell 50%
last week when the company disclosed that its quarterly results had
been delayed. Monday's close left the company with a market value of
$171 million, down from $2.8 billion in January and down from a
split-adjusted peak of more than $12 billion in March 2000, when its
shares traded at $33.</TE>
<TE>   Company representatives said the possible irregularities concerned
sales of Peregrine products from resellers and other third parties,
which accounted for about 40% of the company's annual revenue.
Peregrine, founded in 1981, makes software that allows users to track
and manage inventory, equipment and other assets.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen was dismissed because of its inability "to assure us
they'd be able to deliver on our audit, just because of the separate
things they have been going through," said Rick Nelson, Peregrine's
acting chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting firm is embroiled in the record bankruptcy of Enron
Corp., for which it served as auditor and in-house financial advisor.
Andersen went on trial in Houston on Monday on a federal charge of
obstruction of justice.</TE>
<TE>   In the post-Enron era, several high-profile companies have
announced they are revisiting their past financial statements. But it
is highly unusual for the top executives of a company to step down
concurrently with the announcement of an accounting review.</TE>
<TE>   When Peregrine severed ties with Andersen, there were no
indications of irregularities, Nelson said. At least three senior
executives at Peregrine--Louis Blatt, Thomas Smith and Gary
Lenz--previously were partners at Andersen, according to the
company's latest annual report.</TE>
<TE>   For 2001, Peregrine paid Andersen $185,000 for auditing and
$863,500 in "all other fees," according to a company filing.</TE>
<TE>   Peregrine has been struggling since 1998, having reported eight
consecutive quarterly losses after buying 12 companies. The
acquisition binge left Peregrine short of cash. In March, the company
said it would get rid of a unit with 550 workers. On Monday, company
representatives said Peregrine had less than $100 million in cash.</TE>
<TE>   "They went on a buying spree and didn't really properly integrate
all the acquisitions they made," said Mike Romanowski of Orbitex
Management Inc., who sold his Peregrine holdings during the last
several months.</TE>
<TE>   Peregrine also has said it may be unable to borrow more money
because it failed to comply with the terms of a $150-million,
three-year revolving line of credit. That loan required the company,
which lost $88.3 million in the quarter that ended Dec. 31, to be
profitable.</TE>
<TE>   The company temporarily restructured the loan to avoid being in
violation and had planned to make permanent changes to the loan after
reporting earnings for the recent quarter.</TE>

<HD>Pitt Meeting Reopens Conflict Issue</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Top U.S. markets regulator Harvey Pitt--dogged by controversy over a
private meeting with the head of an accounting firm that once
employed him and that is under investigation by his agency--said
Monday that he would now think twice about holding such sessions.</LD>
<LD>   On April 26, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Pitt met
with the head of KPMG , a Big Five firm being probed by the SEC for
audit work at Xerox Corp.</LD>
<LD>   KPMG was a client of Pitt's when he was a corporate lawyer.</LD>
<TE>   Reopening nagging questions about his judgment and his close ties
to an embattled industry he now polices, the session was the first
time Pitt met Eugene O'Kelly, who became KPMG chairman and chief
executive last week.</TE>
<TE>   Calling the brief conference merely an introductory courtesy call,
Pitt said in a statement: "Neither Mr. O'Kelly nor I discussed any
enforcement matter, including Xerox."</TE>
<TE>   But O'Kelly, in a separate statement, said he did raise the topic
with Pitt: "I referenced a potential proceeding against KPMG at the
very end of our meeting and that KPMG would take all necessary steps
to protect our firm and its reputation."</TE>
<TE>   SEC spokeswoman Christi Harlan said Pitt agreed to the meeting
with O'Kelly only after establishing ground rules putting enforcement
issues off-limits.</TE>

<LD>Major U.S. airlines completed just 78.6% of flights on time in March,
their worst showing since August as air travel recovers after the
Sept. 11 attacks, a Transportation Department report said.</LD>
<LD>   Major airlines have cut fares to boost traffic and recover from
the attacks and a slump in corporate travel. Miles flown by paying
passengers fell 8.8% in March, the smallest drop from a year-earlier
month since the hijackings.</LD>
<LD>   March's on-time rate fell from 84.7% in February and was the
lowest since a rate of 76.2% in August. Still, the rate was up from
75.2% in March 2001 and marked the 12th straight month of improved
results from a year-earlier month.</LD>
<TE>   Continental Airlines Inc. and America West Holdings Corp.'s
America West Airlines led the 10 biggest carriers in March by
completing 84.8% of flights within 15 minutes of their scheduled
arrival time. Northwest Airlines Corp. had the lowest on-time rate of
70.7%, followed by Alaska Air Group Inc.'s Alaska Airlines with at
73.3%.</TE>

billion in six-month bills was sold at a rate of 1.85%, down from

<LD>General Electric Co.'s broadcast of the Winter Olympics on its NBC

Broadcast Cable Financial Management Assn., based on figures compiled
by Ernst &amp; Young. Sports ads rose 67% to $1.45 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Revenue from advertising in the other television categories fell.
Ad sales during prime time declined 22% to $1.36 billion, partly
because of fewer viewers for entertainment shows during the Olympics.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Vietnam's Communist government gave its clearest road map yet for
reform of its inefficient state-owned enterprises, issuing guidelines
to privatize most of them while retaining full ownership of
industries ranging from cigarettes to power transmission.</LD>
<LD>   The government will retain full ownership of enterprises in five
categories, including publishing and enterprises that improve rural
living conditions. It also will retain major state corporations
involved in key industries such as oil and gas and mining.</LD>
<LD>   The guidelines, signed by Prime Minister Phan Van Khai, take
effect this month.</LD>
<TE>   Reforms began in 1992 but quickly bogged down because of
resistance from managers at state enterprises and debate over whether
privatization would threaten the country's socialist system.</TE>

<LD>After a recent rating cut by Moody's, the short-term credit rating of
Vivendi Universal was cut one notch by Standard &amp; Poor's on concern
that a tumbling share price will trigger payments and derail the No.
2 media company's debt-cutting plans.</LD>
<LD>   S&amp;P lowered Vivendi's short-term rating to A-3 from A-2, and
changed its outlook to negative from stable. The credit service
affirmed Vivendi's long-term BBB rating, two notches above junk
status.</LD>
<LD>   Vivendi shares fell for a 10th straight day, dropping to a 4
1/2-year low, as investors question the strategy of Chief Executive
Jean-Marie Messier and fret about liabilities that didn't appear on
the financial statements.</LD>

<LD>Tesoro Petroleum Corp. has renegotiated the price it will pay Valero
Energy Corp. for a refinery and 70 service stations in California,
and the deal will close this month, the companies said.</LD>
<LD>   The San Antonio-based oil companies said they agreed to trim the
purchase price by $50 million to $1.075 billion and defer payment of
$150 million.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, Tesoro Chief Executive Bruce A. Smith stunned Valero
executives and analysts when he announced that Tesoro might back away
from the refinery purchase.</LD>
<TE>   The comment sent Tesoro's stock down 30% on Thursday. It rebounded
by 17% on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   News of the renegotiated deal lifted Tesoro shares by 52 cents to
$9, but it sent Valero shares down $1.36 to $41.63. Both trade on the

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unocal Corp.'s bid to collect at least $300 million from major
refiners might be delayed for months to allow U.S. officials to
review a patent for cleaner gasoline at the center of the case.</LD>
<LD>   The Patent and Trademark Office last year began reexamining the
validity of Unocal's patent on the gasoline formula at the request of
refiners. The agency rejected Unocal's patent in a preliminary review
in February.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Christina Snyder in Los Angeles agreed to
grant refiner Valero Energy Corp. a suspension of Unocal's lawsuit
until July. She was expected to rule by Friday on Unocal's case
against BP, ChevronTexaco Corp., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal/Dutch
Shell Group.</LD>

<HD>'Spider-Man' Raises Bar for New Films</HD>
<DH>Hollywood: The new weekend benchmark of $114.8 million
makes for a coveted target for studios.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAUDIA ELLER and JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spider-Man has set himself up to be either the Joe DiMaggio or Mark
McGwire of Hollywood films.</LD>
<LD>   With a three-day take of $114.8 million at the box office--making
it the first film to eclipse $100 million in that time--the question
now is whether the film will prove as enduring as DiMaggio's 56-game
hitting streak or resemble the seemingly insurmountable record of 70
home runs slugged by McGwire, which soon fell to Barry Bonds.</LD>
<LD>   The new weekend benchmark, as lofty as it is, makes for an
irresistible target for Hollywood studios, for which bragging rights
seem to matter as much as profits.</LD>
<TE>   "It's new territory for all of us," MGM marketing chief Bob Levin
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, it changes the whole idea of how big a movie can
open. The side effect will be increasing pressure on all of us who do
these jobs to get those big weekends."</TE>
<TE>   All told, three out of four moviegoers nationwide went to see the
screen adaptation of the classic Marvel comic books that follow the
adventures of the superhero. That made "Spider-Man" an instant
blockbuster, shattering all of Hollywood's previous assumptions about
how many people it can pack into theaters in a single weekend,
drawing moviegoers across generations.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anyone can answer 'How high is up?'" said Tom
Borys, president of EDI/Nielsen, which tracks box office numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Dergarabedian, president of another box-office tracking firm,
Exhibitor Relations Co., calls the "Spider-Man" accomplishment "the
Holy Grail of box office."</TE>
<TE>   "It creates a new paradigm in terms of what a move can do. It puts
a lot of pressure on all these films. Now 'Spider-Man' is the movie
everybody is going to be judged against," Dergarabedian said.</TE>
<TE>   This summer alone, a host of big-muscle films will hit multiplexes
such as George Lucas' "Star Wars: Episode II--Attack of the Clones,"
"Men in Black 2" and such other potential blockbusters as Steven
Spielberg's "Minority Report," "XXX" and "Austin Powers in
Goldmember."</TE>
<TE>   Later this year will come "Harry Potter and the Chamber
of Secrets" and "Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," with such
anticipated powerhouses as "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines" and
"The Hulk" coming next year.</TE>
<TE>   Opening weekend profits have steadily climbed for a decade, thanks
in part to ticket prices that rose nearly 30% during the 1990s. In
1993, Steven Spielberg's "Jurassic Park" became the first film to
gross more than $50 million in a three-day weekend, a number that had
seemed unthinkable.</TE>
<TE>   But much of the recent growth in opening weekends is owed to
studios' flooding theaters with as many as 8,000 prints of its films
nationwide, a growth in the number of multiplex theaters and the
costly blitzkrieg marketing strategy that blankets TV networks,
newspapers, radio stations, buses and billboard with film ads.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, demographics are working in the industry's favor.
Teens are Hollywood's most coveted audience, and today they have more
disposable income than ever, spending on average $84 a week overall,
according to Teenage Research Unlimited. Census projections also show
the number of 12- to 17-year-olds--Hollywood's prime movie audience
and repeat customers--is growing at a fast clip, rising an estimated
7% in the next five years.</TE>
<TE>   In November, studio executives got a hint that a $100-million
weekend was possible when "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"
came within spitting distance by grossing $90.3 million in three
days. Given its 2 1/2-hour running time, which limited the number of
shows at theaters, that box-office take convinced observers that more
was possible.</TE>
<TE>   Executives at Sony Pictures Entertainment, which released
"Spider-Man," knew as early as Saturday morning they were heading
into new territory.</TE>
<TE>   Results for the previous night showed the film had already grossed
$39 million, a record. "Spider-Man" not only sold out most of the
seats available in theaters, but with a playing time half an hour
shorter than "Harry Potter," theater owners squeezed in additional
screenings.</TE>
<TE>   "We had kids come back two and three times to see the film
over the weekend," said Jerry Pokorski, executive vice president for
Pacific Theatres in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   National Assn. of Theatre Owners President John Fithian also noted
that "Spider-Man" played to full theaters through its late showings
because it also appeals to older moviegoers.</TE>
<TE>   "You had a lot more people at midnight for 'Spider-Man' than you
did for 'Harry Potter,'" Fithian said.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the weekend, "Spider-Man" averaged a record $31,000
per screen for a major Hollywood release. "Spider-Man" out grossed
the No. 2 film, "The Scorpion King," by $105 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Can we look forward to this again?" asked Universal Pictures
distribution chief Nikki Rocco. "Who knows? It's an anomaly, but it
raises the bar. It's all about the competitive marketplace."</TE>
<TE>   Shari Redstone, president of Boston-based National Amusements,
estimates that 80% of the movie chain's business last weekend came
from "Spider-Man" on one-third of its 1,100 screens.</TE>
<TE>   Redstone believes that it will be hard for films to eclipse
"Spider-Man" for now. "You're fairly well reaching the limits," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   For studios, a new benchmark means added pressure because of how
critical a film's opening weekend is in a market crowded with new
titles stacked on top of each other like cars trying to get through a
traffic jam.</TE>
<TE>   Studios spend more than $31 million a picture to market
their films to fill seats on opening weekend, largely because under the
terms they have with theater owners, studios keep a bigger chunk of
the early receipts to defray those costs. Studios also face a growing
trend in which films open to huge numbers, but plunge the next week
because fans are moving on to the next must-see film.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, with weekend box-office results now a mainstay of
Sunday night television newscasts, falling short of any record risks
tarnishing a film.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, "Pearl Harbor" opened to $59 million but was labeled
a major disappointment given the high expectations for the film that
had been built up by the hype.</TE>
<TE>   "Spider-Man" has a long way to go to scale the industry box-office
heights set by 1997's epic "Titanic" from Paramount Pictures and
Twentieth Century Fox. That film grossed $1.8 billion worldwide, of
which a record $600 million was in North America, and remains the
only film to occupy the top spot at the box office for 15 straight
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   As for opening weekends, Paramount Pictures Vice Chairman Rob
Friedman said "Spider-Man" results show "that for a really highly
anticipated, well-marketed and well-positioned movie, the sky's the
limit."</TE>

<HD>Qwest Is Violating Merger Laws, AT&amp;T Says</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Qwest Communications International Inc. is violating federal law by
selling long-distance phone services in 14 Western U.S. states, rival
AT&amp;T Corp. told the Federal Communications Commission.</LD>
<LD>   When Qwest bought US West Inc. in 2000, the company agreed to sell
its long-distance operations in those markets to Touch America
Holdings Inc. Qwest has not complied, said AT&amp;T, the biggest U.S.
long-distance phone company.</LD>
<LD>   "It's our position that Qwest has been deliberately violating,"
merger conditions and providing long-distance services illegally,
said AT&amp;T spokeswoman Claudia Jones. Qwest denies wrongdoing.</LD>
<TE>   Qwest can't sell long-distance services in the 14 states until it
proves the local markets are open to competitors. AT&amp;T and Touch
America say Qwest has leased capacity on its long-distance network
and never turned over control to Touch America.</TE>
<TE>   Denver-based Qwest is also under investigation by state regulators
for failing to disclose agreements that gave local phone rivals
cheaper access to its network in exchange for their silence as it
sought to sell long distance. Qwest shares fell 19 cents to $4.86 on
the New York Stock Exchange. AT&amp;T dropped 16 cents to $13.70 also on
the NYSE.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Moving further from its roots as an Internet market for mom-and-pop
collectibles, EBay Inc. is working with Accenture Ltd. on a service
aimed at helping big companies unload excess merchandise on the site.</LD>
<LD>   The consulting firm will operate the Connection to EBay service,
which is scheduled to be fully up and running this autumn. The
platform will be geared toward large companies that want to sell
discontinued or out-of-season products on EBay but need someone else
to deal with the details.</LD>
<LD>   Accenture estimates that U.S. companies try to sell off $80
billion worth of excess merchandise each year, usually through
multiple vendors and distributors. The firm will try to show that
EBay offers a far more efficient system.</LD>
<TE>   Accenture will get a fee for each product listed, and EBay will
collect its usual fees as well. Financial terms of the partnership
were not disclosed, but it included a licensing fee from Accenture to
EBay.</TE>
<TE>   EBay already has smaller-scale arrangements with other companies
that facilitate multiple product listings for big sellers--part of
what EBay calls its "preferred solution-provider program."</TE>

<HD>A Bitter Experience for German Novice Investors</HD>
<DH>Securities: Deutsche Telekom's losses five years after a
flashy IPO have citizens howling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BONN, Germany</DL>
<LD>When Deutsche Telekom floated its first shares five years ago in the
flashiest stock launch ever witnessed in Europe, public enthusiasm
exceeded the management's wildest expectations.</LD>
<LD>   Millions of schoolchildren watched the buying and selling on
virtual trading floors on the Internet. Mounted police had to keep
order outside Frankfurt's thronged Stock Market Square, the epicenter
of an earthquake of hype and celebration for the stock launch. Three
million of Germany's notoriously conservative savers raided their
passbook accounts and bought "the people's shares," giving birth to a
new community of small investors.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, the stock has lost more than 85% of its March 2000
peak value, hitting a record low Monday. The company posted a
breathtaking loss of $3.2 billion last year. And its much-criticized
investment in third-generation mobile licenses and its acquisition of
U.S. company VoiceStream Wireless have pushed debt close to the
company's total value.</LD>
<TE>   Germany's "baby shareholders," as Telekom Chairman Ron Sommer
calls those swept up by the initial public offering, are now
squalling. One group has sued Telekom and the federal government,
which remains the biggest stockholder. Others have been howling for
Sommer's head to roll. Some have even lambasted the TV personalities
hired to promote the IPO, accusing them of luring loyal fans into bad
investments.</TE>
<TE>   Like hundreds of thousands who jumped on the Telekom bandwagon too
late, Petra Pankoke, a 31-year-old fashion designer from the Munich
area, regards the investment experience as a bitter lesson about
getting infected by "stock fever."</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed like a good alternative to the meager returns of a
normal savings account," she said of her more than $5,000 stake in
Telekom. "My main reasoning was that this was a good, solid German
company that would be a sure bet. I just blindly trusted everything
that was being said," said the first-time investor who has lost about
half of her savings.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew it was a risk, but it didn't seem like such a big one when
we all bought our first shares and they went straight up for more
than a year," recalled Friedrich Geyer, a retired electrician in the
eastern town of Auerbach.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts and litigators accuse Telekom of overly ambitious
acquisitions and excessive borrowing.</TE>
<TE>   "It is certainly to Sommer's credit that he took a state-owned
company into the stock market with the success he did," said Lars
Labryga, an attorney for the Society for the Protection of Small
Shareholders, which keeps tabs on nearly 900 publicly traded
companies in Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Labryga said he recognized that the global economic stagnation of
the last year has been a key influence on stock markets, but he
contended that much of the problem with Telekom has been caused by
bad management.</TE>
<TE>   Chief among those missteps, professional analysts and disappointed
investors insist, were the company's staggering bids for
third-generation mobile licenses and early-retirement buyouts that
pushed it deep into debt.</TE>
<TE>   Telekom's flagging fortunes provoke some comparison to the fate of
Enron Corp., the Texas-based company whose bankruptcy filing last
year left employees and small shareholders with almost worthless
investments.</TE>
<TE>   But there are differences. For example, the German government's
generous retirement provisions are still relied on by most people in
this country to cover the bulk of their golden-years expenses. It was
the government's push to get savers to put more of their money into
shares that probably is Telekom's chief victim.</TE>
<TE>   Pouring salt on investors' wounds, Telekom announced in March that
it was slashing its 2001 dividend by 40% to cut costs. Many of the 3
million small investors in Telekom have been further infuriated by a
proposed 89% increase in salaries for the eight board members, to a
collective $16 million, that shareholders will vote on and probably
approve at the May 28 annual meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Sommer conceded in an interview that the last year has put a
damper on Germans' enthusiasm for putting their money into stocks.
But he blames a lack of experience for the widespread disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   "On one side, we were the ones who convinced Germans to invest in
stocks and not just bonds. The problem was in the baby investors.
They felt it was very easy to make money by investing in stocks in
the boom market that followed the IPO, that they didn't have to work
to make money," Sommer told The Times. "Experienced investors like
those in the U.S. know that this isn't the case. They know that
markets have cycles."</TE>
<TE>   Though there has been much hand-wringing over the stock's value,
Sommer insisted Telekom was never pushed as a short-term investment
and shareholders are best advised to ride out what he sees as a
temporary trough. He also predicts small investors will regain their
confidence in the market if Telekom can deliver on its forecast of
10% growth this year and debt reduction from $56.8 billion to $45.8
billion by the end of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a clear strategy. We have to do what is right for the
long term, even if painful in the short term," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sommer insisted that analysts' guarded outlook on his company's
stock is "unfounded."</TE>
<TE>   "They think in segments, and the telecommunications segment of the
stock market is not seen as ascendant at the moment," he said. "But
this is because of a few black sheep. Deutsche Telekom is a strong
company with a strong future, and the reaction of investors is not
justified."</TE>
<TE>   It is the company's long-term growth strategy that has forced it
into debt. Ongoing restructuring has cost the company dearly in
early-retirement write-offs, and Sommer recently said the 3G
mobile-phone services would be marketable only in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Telekom also was hit last year with the "flowback" of shares it
used to pay for its acquisition of VoiceStream to get a foot in what
it sees as a promising U.S. market. The deal allowed those shares to
be cashed in last summer, putting a strain on resources.</TE>
<TE>   Savvy investment managers at Deutsche Bank foresaw the flowback
effect and sent the stock plummeting by 20% last August when they
sold 44 million Telekom shares on behalf of an institutional client.</TE>
<TE>   Just that kind of bruising of the babies by the big players is
what has dealt an incalculable setback to the hopes--so high just two
years ago--for nurturing a nation of equity investors.</TE>
<TE>   "The Deutsche Telekom experience has been a gigantic
disappointment for many people, and I can imagine it makes them very
wary of stock ownership," Labryga said. "And not just Deutsche
Telekom but the whole market."</TE>

<HD>'Spider-Man' Fails to Save Day on Wall St.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Bloomberg News, Times Staff</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even Spider-Man couldn't save Wall Street on Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Sony Corp.'s movie about the web-slinging superhero smashed box
office records over the weekend. But the stocks of several companies
that stand to benefit from spider-mania turned in decidedly unheroic
performances during Monday's market sell-off.</LD>
<LD>   Sony's American depositary receipts fell 2 cents to $54, even
though the movie's weekend gross of almost $115 million was the
fastest trip past $100 million in ticket sales in cinematic history.</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps anticipating the movie's success, shares of Sony (ticker
symbol: SNE) are up almost 20% this year.</TE>
<TE>   The film's success also failed to boost other spider-related
stocks. Toy maker Grand Toys International Inc. (GRIN), which has the
rights to produce Spider-Man action figures, lost 4 cents to $2.80,
and CKE Restaurants Inc. (CKR), which is selling collectors cups at
its Hardee's and Carl's Jr. hamburger chains, slumped 72 cents to
$11.55.</TE>
<TE>   Even Marvel Enterprises Inc. (MVL), publisher of "Spider-Man"
comic books, climbed only 4 cents to $7.70--and it was in the red
until the last few minutes of trading.</TE>

<HD>Venture Fund-Raising Falls to Six-Year Low</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News, Times Staff</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. venture capitalists, saddled with new funds they haven't
invested, slowed fund-raising to a six-year low in the first quarter,
according to Venture Economics and the National Venture Capital Assn.</LD>
<LD>   A total of 44 funds received $2.2 billion in commitments last
quarter, down 87% from $16.5 billion a year earlier, according to a
joint study.</LD>
<LD>   It marked the seventh consecutive quarterly decline from a peak of
$30.3 billion in 2000's second quarter and the least since the third
quarter of 1996, when the industry raised $1.3 billion.</LD>
<TE>   Venture capital firms haven't been able to sell investments and
distribute proceeds to the investors who supply capital because of
slumping stock markets and decreased demand for initial share
offerings.</TE>
<TE>   That's making investors, many of whom reached their allocation
limits to private equity, hesitant to commit to new funds.</TE>
<TE>   The shrinking appetite for money follows several years in which
venture firms raised record amounts.</TE>
<TE>   Some firms even gave back a portion of the commitments they got
because they couldn't invest the money fast enough.</TE>
<TE>   The slowing investment pace drew complaints from investors that
firms weren't earning their management fees.</TE>

<HD>NYSE Chief Offers Help With Merrill Settlement</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New York Stock Exchange Chairman Richard Grasso has offered his help
in bringing about a resolution to the investigation of Merrill Lynch
&amp; Co. stock analysts by New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer.</LD>
<LD>   Grasso called Spitzer on Friday, offering to arrange a meeting
with Merrill Lynch Chairman David Komansky to craft a settlement
without lawyers present, said NYSE spokesman Rich Adamonis.</LD>
<LD>   The offer was reported Monday by the Wall Street Journal, which
quoted Grasso as saying he is concerned about a growing perception
among small investors that "Wall Street is totally corrupt."</LD>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch officials and Spitzer couldn't be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer has said millions of investors lost money because of
too-rosy stock recommendations by stock analysts.</TE>
<TE>   Last month he unveiled a series of e-mails sent by Merrill
analysts showing they apparently had grave doubts about some stocks
that they were recommending to investors.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer and Merrill are negotiating a fine and payment to
investors who lost money based on the stock recommendations of the
firm's analysts, as well as larger-scale reforms for its stock
research division. The changes are expected to serve as an industry
model.</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission also is investigating, and
Spitzer has widened his investigation to include many of Merrill
Lynch's major Wall Street rivals.</TE>

<LD>PAKISTAN</LD>
<LD>   A Pakistani judge adjourned for two more days the trial of Muslim
militants in the kidnapping and slaying of Wall Street Journal
reporter Daniel Pearl.</LD>
<LD>   The trial had been set to resume Monday after the Supreme Court in
the morning denied a defense request for a stay pending a hearing on
its petition to move the trial from Hyderabad back to Karachi, where
Pearl disappeared Jan. 23.</LD>
<TE>   But the judge later adjourned the case until Wednesday because the
lawyer for three of four defendants, Rai Bashir, could not make it
back from Islamabad, the capital, where he had argued before the high
court.</TE>

<LD>   Army helicopters killed more than 200 rebels in airstrikes in
western Nepal, a government spokesman said, amid the deadliest
fighting since the communist insurgency began six years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Officials say security forces have killed more than 560 rebels
since Thursday. That claim could not be confirmed because of lack of
access to the battle zones in remote districts of Rolpa and Pyuthanc,
about 150 miles west of Katmandu.</LD>
<TE>   "It seems like a massacre has taken place. Whether of Maoists or
civilians, it's impossible to say," said the Amnesty International's
Nepal researcher, Ingrid Massage.</TE>

<LD>   The ILO said it was particularly alarmed at the fact that such a
high number--about 180 million--were trapped in what it called the

<HD>Chirac Names New Prime Minister</HD>
<DH>France: After his landslide victory, the president picks a
moderate, heeding the message of protest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Fresh from trouncing far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, President
Jacques Chirac named a grass-roots moderate from the provinces Monday
to govern France in the run-up to crucial parliamentary elections.</LD>
<LD>   Jean-Pierre Raffarin, 53, has six weeks as interim prime minister
to ensure the momentum from Chirac's landslide in Sunday's
presidential runoff translates into a center-right majority at
National Assembly elections on June 9 and 16.</LD>
<LD>   Little known outside Poitou-Charentes, the area of western France
around Poitiers where Raffarin heads the regional council, his
appointment signaled that Chirac had heeded the message of protest
from voters fed up with an unresponsive elite in Paris.</LD>
<TE>   "I have heard and understood your appeal for a republic which is
alive, for a nation that joins forces and for a change in the way
politics is conducted," Chirac said Sunday night in a victory speech
that pledged action on crime and jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "We won't forget the discontent the French people have expressed
... and this demand for action, this demand that we be closer to
them," Raffarin said after taking office.</TE>
<TE>   A graduate of a business school rather than the civil service
academy that traditionally grooms France's ruling class, the former
marketing executive was named after Socialist Lionel Jospin tendered
his resignation as premier.</TE>
<TE>   Final official results Monday showed that Chirac crushed his
National Front party challenger with 82.2% of the vote--the highest
in the 44-year history of France's Fifth Republic--in an outpouring
of disdain for Le Pen's xenophobia.</TE>
<TE>   But the result was more a referendum against Le Pen than an
endorsement of Chirac, 69, whose first-round score of just under 20%
was the lowest on record for an incumbent president.</TE>
<TE>   Le Pen, 73, got just 17.8% after capitalizing in the first round
on a surge of protest among voters that everyday concerns were being
ignored by the Paris establishment.</TE>
<TE>   Illustrating the stakes for Chirac and Raffarin, only 13% of
people questioned by the opinion polling agency Louis Harris in the
wake of Sunday's vote said they had backed Chirac because of his
program. Seventy-five percent said their main reason was to shut out
Le Pen. Forty-four percent did not even know who Raffarin was.</TE>
<TE>   Raffarin, who took over from Jospin in an emotional handover at
the prime minister's Matignon Palace, will now form an interim
administration that the Chirac camp hopes will give it an upper hand
in the National Assembly campaign.</TE>
<TE>   A Sofres poll last week gave 301 seats to the Chirac camp to
around 252 for leftist parties in the 577-seat assembly.</TE>
<TE>   It also said Le Pen's National Front could enter the lower chamber
for the first time since 1988 with up to three seats.</TE>

<HD>Colombia Asks U.N. to Probe Church Bombing</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>QUIBDO, Colombia</DL>
<LD>Even as government troops struggled Monday to reach a village where
110 civilians were reported slain, President Andres Pastrana called
for a U.N. commission to look into the bloodbath.</LD>
<LD>   Wooden boats carrying some of the wounded--men, women and
children--began arriving in Quibdo, a grimy port town upriver from
the jungle village of Bojaya, where the civilians, including about 40
children, died during fighting between rebels and paramilitary
gunmen.</LD>
<LD>   Many were killed Thursday when a mortar round allegedly fired by
rebels hit a church, where the villagers had sought shelter.</LD>
<TE>   "Hopefully, the United Nations will come and see firsthand what
the terrorists are doing here," Pastrana told reporters in Bogota.</TE>
<TE>   He rejected accusations that the attacks--some of the worst
against civilians in Colombia's 38-year war--could have been
prevented had authorities heeded warnings from U.N. and Colombian
human rights monitors.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in an internal conflict and we are trying to cover all the
national territory," said Pastrana, indicating that his U.S.-backed
security forces were stretched too thin.</TE>
<TE>   Army Gen. Fernando Tapias, head of Colombia's armed forces,
accused the rebels of intentionally targeting the civilians in
Bojaya.</TE>
<TE>   Those who survived the attack on the church there described a
hellish scene. Residents of the poor fishing village had agreed to
meet in the concrete-walled church in case of an attack. About 600
people were inside when the explosion occurred.</TE>
<TE>   "There was sound like thunder and then the mortar crashed down.
People's faces were destroyed, their bodies bloodied," said Oscar
Guzman, a teacher who was hiding in the church along with his wife
and 15-year-old son, who all escaped unharmed.</TE>
<TE>   Waving T-shirts and any other white cloth they could find, stunned
survivors fled the church, boarded boats and crossed the river to the
sister town of Vigia del Fuerte, from where Guzman was reached by
telephone Monday. Some fled on foot.</TE>
<TE>   "The people thought the church was a place that would be
respected," said Joaquin Palacio, a Choco State assemblyman in Quibdo
who said he lost two brothers and other relatives in the attack. "I'm
feeling so terribly impotent because I can't even go and bury my
dead."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Quits Treaty on Global Court</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: The Bush administration won't back the move for
a criminal tribunal. U.N. officials call the action unprecedented.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>Unilateralism is back--or at least that's what critics of two new
Bush administration initiatives here contend.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, the administration informed the United Nations that it
is nullifying the December 2000 U.S. signature on the treaty
establishing the International Criminal Court, a decision that U.N.
officials called unprecedented.</LD>
<LD>   Libya is the only other country that has remained consistently and
vociferously opposed to the court's creation. Although other
nations--among them China, Israel, Iraq, Libya, Qatar and Yemen--have
expressed opposition to aspects of the court, they have not joined
the U.S. in repudiating the treaty.</LD>
<TE>   The administration contends that the court could expose U.S.
soldiers and officials abroad to politically motivated "war crimes"
prosecutions.</TE>
<TE>   "We regret that this has happened, as we are in favor of the
universality of the treaty," said George Cunningham, a spokesman for
the European Commission here.</TE>
<TE>   The treaty was signed by the United States and 138 other countries
and has been ratified by 66--including every European Union member
except Greece, which plans to approve it soon.</TE>
<TE>   No other nation has ever voided a sovereign signature on a binding
international treaty, according to U.N. officials and international
law experts. "This action by the U.S. is unique," said Fred Eckhard,
spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. "It is
unprecedented."</TE>
<TE>   Also Monday, Bush administration envoys were at the U.N. seeking
to remove all references to "reproductive health services" from a
document being drafted for adoption at the U.N. Special Session on
Children this week--a fight in which it is opposed by most U.N.
members, including all its closest Western allies.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. delegates are urging U.N. members to promote sexual
abstinence rather than birth control among adolescents.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. delegation is also objecting to proposed references in
the document to the legal rights of children, as enshrined in the
U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child. That treaty was adopted
without dissent by the General Assembly in 1989, but the United
States subsequently refused to ratify the accord, because
conservatives in Congress argued that it undermined parental
authority.</TE>
<TE>   "They are not only against signing the [child's rights]
treaty--they don't want it to be the terms of reference for anyone
else," Adrienne Germain, president of the International Women's
Health Coalition, said recently. Somalia is the only other U.N.
member that hasn't ratified the convention on children's rights.</TE>
<TE>   "You have several important topics ... where we are getting these
quite disquieting messages," said Inocencio Felix Llamas Arias,
Spain's ambassador to the U.N. "The perception in Chile, in Morocco,
in India, in Finland, in Spain is that this is unilateralism, and
people don't understand why the leader of the whole world would be
embracing unilateralism."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration had been expected to announce its tough
stance on the criminal court and the U.N. children's rights
conference around the time of the U.N. General Assembly meeting that
was scheduled to take place in late September. But the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks forced the postponement of the assembly
session--and, more important, triggered a swift reshaping of U.S.
strategy in the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, these issues have simultaneously surfaced anew, and
some former U.S. diplomats contend that the Bush administration could
inadvertently jeopardize the status of other international agreements
that the U.S. supports.</TE>
<TE>   "This has very dangerous implications for the whole fabric of
international law," said Timothy Wirth, a former Democratic senator
and State Department official who runs Ted Turner's United Nations
Foundation. "If they do this, what does this mean for all the other
commitments we have made?"</TE>
<TE>   Monday's decision, however, was hailed by U.S. critics of the
international court and of the United Nations. "Actions taken today
by the Bush administration mark a clear victory for American
sovereignty over globalism," said Thomas Kilgannon, director of
Virginia-based Freedom Alliance. The U.N. was officially notified in
a three-sentence letter on Monday that the U.S. "does not intend to
become a party of the treaty."</TE>
<TE>   Some international law experts have questioned the legality of a
retroactive invalidation of a treaty signature, but the U.N. has
not--and doesn't intend to, officials here said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Some diplomats here who opposed the U.S. action said they
nonetheless considered it technically defensible, because signing a
treaty is presumed to imply endorsement. Yet even President Clinton,
who approved the signing three weeks before he left office, said that
he didn't support the treaty in its current form.</TE>
<TE>   "You could equally say Clinton was not playing by the rules,
because signing a treaty should signify an intention to ratify," said
a European diplomat here who asked not to be named.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials made the same argument Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton "made it quite clear from the start that he did not intend
to send it to the Senate for ratification and therefore obligate the
United States completely in that regard," said Richard Boucher, a
State Department spokesman.</TE>

<HD>Plenty of Good Eggs in This Serbian Town</HD>
<DH>Culture: Orthodox Christianity meets folk ritual at Easter
in Mokrin, where a good egg is a matter of pride.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOKRIN, Yugoslavia</DL>
<LD>A burly oil industry worker boasts of playing Easter egg games, even
when they were outlawed during Communist times.</LD>
<LD>   When bridges are washed away, egg trucks trundle along circuitous
routes to help ensure that major Serbian cities are supplied for the
holiday.</LD>
<LD>   A 34-year-old economist speaks with pride of what she went through
during the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's 1999 bombing of
Belgrade, the Yugoslav and Serbian capital: She set cooking alcohol
on fire in her living room so she could boil and dye traditional
eggs.</LD>
<TE>   "I remember thinking, 'If the United States doesn't set us on fire
with the bombs, I will, but we'll have our Easter eggs,'" said the
economist, Maya Jankovec.</TE>
<TE>   Through all the vicissitudes of this troubled country, eggs, and
the ancient folk rituals linked to them, have been a cultural
constant, particularly during Orthodox Easter, which this year fell
over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout many parts of the Balkans, the centerpiece of the
holiday is a cherished old game in which two people bang dyed
hard-boiled eggs together. The egg that cracks first is the loser;
the other goes on to bang again.</TE>
<TE>   It's serious competition, but there is great affection in the way
the competitors talk about their eggs. "The natural egg has a mystery
all its own. You can't give or take something from the egg. There is
just the egg," said Ladicorbic Ziva, 49, a tall, bearded dentist with
a gentle smile and one of the judges in the egg-banging contest that
this small town has become known for.</TE>
<TE>   But the red eggs of Serbian lore also have magical and sexual
connotations that are as much pre-Christian ritual as Orthodox rite.</TE>
<TE>   "The folk religion of Serbia is full of these folk elements, and
because it is so deeply rooted in the people, the church gave it a
Christian framework," said Jasna Mijailovic, a librarian in the
ethnology department at Belgrade University.</TE>
<TE>   The Orthodox Church has even integrated red eggs into the biblical
stories surrounding Easter, she said. When Mary Magdalene brought
news of Christ's resurrection to Rome, she is said to have carried
one red egg, "because the egg, when put under a chicken, creates
life--and therefore was a symbol of the resurrection," Mijailovic
said.</TE>
<TE>   The eggs are colored red to symbolize the blood of Christ, as well
as life and health, according to ethnologists. In the past women used
onion skins and the hawthorn plant to turns the eggs a rich, deep
hue.</TE>
<TE>   In some rural areas, red eggs are believed to have special powers
throughout the year: They are rubbed over a woman's freshly bathed
body to make her more beautiful or buried in fallow fields to produce
healthy crops.</TE>
<TE>   Around this time of year, every green market has fresh chicken
eggs piled high alongside more exotic varieties--especially prized
are the small, sleek Japanese quail eggs. Egg dealers say they sell
as many as 100,000 eggs, some of them pre-decorated for busy
customers, in the days leading up to Easter.</TE>
<TE>   Most Serbian families buy about 60 eggs for the holiday,
decorating them in the three days before the holiday, in accordance
with church rules. The first egg dyed is kept as the "guardian of the
house"; the rest are destined to be destroyed by the egg-banging
crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere is the passion for the game more pronounced than in
Mokrin, a town of 6,000 in the Vojvodina region of northern Serbia.
Here the village fathers hold what they have ambitiously named the
"World Championship Egg-Banging Competition." On Sunday the only
apparent foreign spectators present were some visitors from nearby
Slovenia, although some of the standing-room-only audience of 300
came from remote areas of Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic.</TE>
<TE>   Mokrin sits in the middle of the rich plain that stretches across
northern Serbia and into Hungary. It is Serbia's breadbasket, and to
listen to natives talk, the farming heritage is inseparable from the
egg competition.</TE>
<TE>   Early on Easter morning in the town's main square, groups of men,
many dressed in suits in honor of the holiday, gather to examine one
another's eggs. One man after another takes a brightly colored
specimen out of his pocket, taps it gently against his teeth, nods
soberly and exchanges his egg with his companion, who repeats the
operation. They then agree--or disagree--on whether the egg will be a
strong banger.</TE>
<TE>   The competition is intense, but there is an inescapable element of
sexual innuendo in what Mijailovic calls "saucy games." In Serbian
slang, the word for "eggs" also means "testicles," and "bang"
connotes sexual intercourse.</TE>
<TE>   The lore is unending. An egg laid in the afternoon is stronger
than an egg laid in the morning. Eggs gathered in December and
January are stronger than those gathered in spring, because in winter
the hens lay only one egg a week. One of the sexually loaded maxims
is that an egg fathered by a young rooster is particularly strong.</TE>
<TE>   "A champion egg needs to be big and have a thin sound when tapped
against the teeth," Belos Zarko, a 39-year-old oil field worker, said
firmly.</TE>
<TE>   "Nowhere in the world can you give someone two eggs and have them
tell you which is stronger, but here in Mokrin even a small child
will know, and that's what I want to pass on to my children," Zarko
said.</TE>
<TE>   Some Mokrin clans have created egg-banging dynasties, so it was no
surprise when a member of the Terzic family walked away with one of
the top prizes Sunday. What was striking was that the winner was
Kristina Terzic, 14, the only girl to reach the finals.</TE>
<TE>   She started banging eggs when she was 7, competing against her
father and older brother, but had never won before. She beamed as she
held up her winning egg and then watched confidently as the judges
sliced it to ensure that it was a genuine chicken egg. (It was.)
Sometimes people try to cheat by sneaking in duck eggs, which are
stronger. Her prize was a letter proclaiming her the 2002 winner in
the youth competition and a grocery bag full of flour.</TE>
<TE>   The festival also draws a crowd of vendors to Mokrin's main
street, hawking an incongruous collection of wares. Hair barrettes
and stuffed animals lie next to women's underwear and toy guns--a
staple for Yugoslav children. It was a long way from Easter and a
reminder of the region's other face.</TE>
<TE>   Ziva, the contest judge, hopes that children will be more
interested in the eggs than in the commercial side of the festival.</TE>
<TE>   "This commercialization is a necessary evil that follows us," he
said, "but the eggs, they get under your skin. It lives in me. When I
hold eggs in my hand, it calms me down, and to learn how to do it
[bang the eggs], you have to invest a bit of yourself."</TE>

<HD>A Crafty Con Gives Israel the Slip, Again</HD>
<DH>Crime: A notorious Palestinian thief and accused terrorist
makes a shocking escape from a prison bus, stunning the nation but
also earning a bit of respect.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>As Israel and the rest of the world focused Monday on the 150
Palestinians and clerics trying to get out of Bethlehem's Church of
the Nativity, a very different escape story was competing for
headlines, generating bemusement, concern and even a modicum of
respect among Israelis for the skills of a Palestinian.</LD>
<LD>   Early Sunday, while thief extraordinaire and accused terrorist
Mahmoud abu Jamous was being transported inside a special locked cage
in a fortified police bus, pinned down with handcuffs and leg
restraints, accompanied by two other security vehicles and overseen
by 10 elite Israeli prison guards, he managed to escape.</LD>
<LD>   What's worse, no one in the convoy realized that he had slipped
away until a motorist called police to report that he'd seen sneakers
popping out of the bus' barred window as the vehicle waited for a
stoplight in a northern Israeli town. The motorist said he saw a man
drop to the street and disappear in a flash.</LD>
<TE>   It was 20 minutes before police figured out what had happened and
were able to mobilize a search using helicopters, dogs and hundreds
of officers. By that time, Abu Jamous was long gone.</TE>
<TE>   "What else do we need to make sure prisoner Jamous leaves point A
and reaches point B?" asked a columnist in the daily newspaper
Maariv. "Fighter jets?"</TE>
<TE>   In a nation weary after months of terror and bloodshed, the
absurdity of the Abu Jamous escape was embraced by some for the rare
moment of levity it provided.</TE>
<TE>   "We've gone through so much. If you can, you have to laugh a bit,"
said Tamar Meshulan, a 31-year-old industrial designer. "He's
probably a genius. He certainly knows his business."</TE>
<TE>   But others wondered how a state with such a sophisticated
military, which prides itself on its vigilant police and security
forces, could be so humiliated by a common criminal being transferred
from one prison to another.</TE>
<TE>   "Our whole society, our mind-set, our political system--everything
in this country is organized around security," said Doran Rosenblum,
a social commentator and columnist with Haaretz newspaper. "Yet here
we have an example of a very dangerous man managing to escape in a
country with the biggest army in the Middle East. It just shows how
real security evades us."</TE>
<TE>   Then again, Abu Jamous is no ordinary thief. According to Israeli
press reports, he has long been known as a champion pilferer, a
burglar's burglar who possessed almost magical power to slip into
vehicles and apartments without notice. He was also known for leaving
his business card, plastered with fingerprints, behind in an apparent
taunt to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a cat with nine lives, a real devil," said one of his
guards, who was quoted anonymously in Maariv. "He certainly deserves
the title as the Champion of Israeli Escape Artists."</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, Abu Jamous, 24, was arrested on charges of
burglarizing dozens of Israeli homes. As he was being brought to
court, he delivered a swift kick to a guard, then vanished into the
crowded streets. Media reports say that, for several weeks, he lived
in the apartment of an elderly woman, who was unaware the whole time
that she had a roommate.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Jamous reportedly joined Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat's Fatah group, according to reports in the newspaper
Yediot Aharonot. He is accused of using his skills to help armed
Palestinians dodge security sweeps and slip past roadblocks to enter
Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Jamous had reportedly once burglarized the house of an Israeli
navy colonel named Natan Barak; he is said to have returned in
October to plant a bomb in a fire extinguisher. Barak noticed the
device and called police, who detonated it safely in a nearby field.</TE>
<TE>   Police set up a special investigative unit to catch Abu Jamous,
and he was finally recaptured in November after being shot in the leg
during a chase. Late last month, he was convicted and sentenced in
the Kfar Saba Magistrates Court to 68 months in prison for the
burglaries and car thefts. And he was due to be tried in a military
court for membership in a terrorist organization and for the
attempted murder of the colonel.</TE>
<TE>   Even with his injured leg, Abu Jamous was declared a "high escape
risk," which meant that his transport was to be handled by the elite
Nahshon prison security unit.</TE>
<TE>   Oded Leibowitz, the driver who reported the great escape to
police, told Yediot Aharonot that he could barely believe his eyes.
"It was so strange that it took me some time to realize what I'd just
seen," he told the newspaper. "Everything seemed planned, like in a
movie."</TE>
<TE>   As for Abu Jamous, he's apparently already back at work. Three
burglaries were reported Sunday around the area where he escaped, and
police believe he was stocking up on clothes and provisions.</TE>
<TE>   Commentator Rosenblum said Abu Jamous' bold move against great
odds has turned the tables a bit in Israel, where many Israelis tend
to see themselves as smart and, when required, cleverly
mischievous--and to view Palestinians as largely bereft of such
qualities. "With this guy, the Palestinians now have their own myth
in the making," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Many young people will look up to him as a hero," agreed Mustafa
Barghouti, a Palestinian and director of the Center for Political and
Media Analysis. "He managed to escape through the whole of the
Israeli security system."</TE>
<TE>   The media and top security officials are calling for heads to
roll. The 10 escorts have been suspended pending an investigation,
which could include polygraph tests and will almost certainly include
a look into whether the guards had fallen asleep during the trip.</TE>
<TE>   Betty Zaroom, a 29-year-old student, believes the guards are being
made scapegoats, however. "Every occupation makes mistakes," she
said. "Politicians make them all the time, and they don't get blamed.
The police are trying their best, and it's ultimately the
government's fault for not giving them enough resources to do their
jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Like a good mystery story, the case has left many Israelis trying
to figure out how the Palestinian Houdini pulled it off.</TE>
<TE>   Albert Dahan, a 39-year-old construction worker, thinks Abu Jamous
must have had some inside help in the detention service. "There was
probably some bribery," he said. "Bribery works everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Eli Eta, a 42-year-old shop owner, says he believes the guards
just did something stupid, like forgetting to handcuff Abu Jamous,
and are making him look superhuman to hide their mistake. "If we
weren't in the middle of the intifada, it wouldn't be such big news,"
he added.</TE>
<TE>   Unnamed defense establishment officials termed the escape a
complete disgrace in the local media. Enormous resources were spent
to catch Abu Jamous, they said, only to have him slip through their
hands again.</TE>
<TE>   "We were sure he would no longer be a danger," one senior security
official told Maariv. "Now we have to start everything from scratch."</TE>

<HD>Palestinians Describe Deal to End Standoff at Church</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Official says 13 men would be sent to Italy and 26
to Gaza. The Israelis, however, deny that a final agreement has been
reached.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER and CAROLYN COLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>BETHLEHEM, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Palestinian gunmen holed up inside the Church of the Nativity
accepted a deal early today that would send 13 of them into exile,
bringing a monthlong standoff to its end.</LD>
<LD>   "A deal has been reached," the Palestinian governor for Bethlehem,
Mohammed Madani, said from inside the church. "The implementation
will take place within hours."</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for the Israeli defense minister, however, said a deal
had not yet been struck. Final details remained unresolved, he said
without elaborating. "They are still talking," Lt. Col. Yarden
Vatikay said early today, referring to U.S., European, Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators.</LD>
<TE>   But the Palestinians were more definitive. Madani spoke to The
Times after a mediator arrived inside the darkened, besieged church
with a list of names. By candlelight, he read out the names of 13 men
who would be exiled to Italy. Twenty-six other men would be banished
to the Gaza Strip. The rest would go free under terms of the deal,
being brokered in long hours of negotiation.</TE>
<TE>   One man inside burst into sobs. Others gathered under an icon of
the Virgin Mary with the baby Jesus and discussed the names or made
preparations to leave the church where they sought refuge April 2.
Several made cellular telephone calls to their families to say
goodbye.</TE>
<TE>   Madani said the 13 men, whom Israel considers senior militants
guilty of attacks on Israelis, will be transported to Cairo under
U.S. protection and then go on to Italy, where they were to remain
for an unspecified duration. It wasn't clear when the men would begin
leaving the building.</TE>
<TE>   It also wasn't clear what, if any, legal proceedings the 13 men
will be subject to. Israel has demanded that at least some of the men
face trial.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement appeared to grant Israel's request that 13 men be
exiled, instead of only eight, which had been the Palestinian demand.
Palestinians inside the church sent a message late Monday to
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat urging him to resolve
the long standoff.</TE>
<TE>   Deporting Palestinians is a sensitive matter for a people who
count millions of their number in the diaspora.</TE>
<TE>   "I am angry," said Rami Kamel, a gunman inside the church. "But I
will accept."</TE>
<TE>   Kamel, 22, a militant from the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade who lost
his hand in fighting, said he hoped he would be safe in Italy.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only have I lost my hand, but now I lost my country," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   On the list of 13 men are three members of the radical Islamic
movement Hamas, four Palestinian security officials and six members
of the Al Aqsa brigade, according to Mohammed Thabet, a Palestinian
security official inside the church. Ibrahim Abeiyat, the top
commander of Al Aqsa for Bethlehem, was among those who will go to
Italy, Palestinians said.</TE>
<TE>   Arduous negotiations aimed an ending the standoff at the revered
church had bogged down over these final details.</TE>
<TE>   Haggling had also continued until early today over how the
militants in the church would hand over their weapons. Israel has
said that as soon as the 123 Palestinians and 30 clergy members
emerge from the 4th century basilica, it will pull its troops out of
Bethlehem, where the army has kept residents under a military curfew.</TE>
<TE>   Bethlehem is the last Palestinian-controlled town occupied by
Israel since it launched its massive West Bank offensive March 29 in
response to a wave of Palestinian suicide bombings. Arafat has said
that he will not negotiate a broader cease-fire until Israel pulls
its troops out of all areas occupied during the operation.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials said they were eager to resolve the standoff at
the church before Prime Minister Ariel Sharon meets today with
President Bush at the White House, where Sharon intends to present
his own peace plan and hear Bush's ideas on holding an international
peace conference.</TE>
<TE>   The government underscored Monday that, even if Israel withdraws
from Bethlehem, its troop deployment in the West Bank will remain
very different from what it was before March 29. Troops and tanks
tightly blockade Palestinian cities, and soldiers routinely raid
Palestinian-controlled areas to hunt down militants.</TE>
<TE>   Troops surrounded the West Bank town of Tulkarm on Monday, in what
the army described as an operation to prevent a planned attack in
Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the army issued a second apology for killing a
Palestinian woman and her two children, ages 4 and 6, as they picked
grape leaves near the West Bank town of Jenin on Sunday. Initially,
the army said troops opened fire after an explosive device went off
next to their tank.</TE>
<TE>   But the army said Monday that it found no evidence of an
explosion. Investigators said a tread came off the tank, making a
loud noise that the soldiers inside believed was a bomb. They
responded with heavy gunfire, killing the woman and her children.</TE>
<TE>   In Bethlehem, Israelis and Palestinians have traded blame for what
each side describes as the defilement of the Church of the Nativity,
built on the site where Christians believe Jesus was born.</TE>
<TE>   The weeks of negotiations, played out as gunfights and fires
periodically erupted in the compound and Palestinian casualties
mounted, have frustrated the Bush administration and strained
Israel's relations with the Vatican and other Christian groups.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. diplomat confirmed that a CIA officer--identified in the
Israeli newspaper Maariv as the Tel Aviv station chief--has joined
efforts to resolve the standoff, conducting talks with Mohammed
Rashid, a senior Arafat aide. Sharon's government also dispatched a
"senior Israeli" to negotiate directly with Arafat late Monday,
Israel Television reported. It did not identify the envoy.</TE>
<TE>   "It is only a question of mathematics now," said Vatikay, the
spokesman for Israeli Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer. "We are
waiting for Arafat's decision."</TE>
<TE>   But Father David Jaeger, spokesman for the Roman Catholic Church's
Franciscan order, said that talks between the two sides stalled
Monday. "They are at a stalemate," Jaeger said in a telephone
interview from Rome, before this morning's developments.</TE>
<TE>   Jaeger confirmed that the Italian government had reservations
about accepting militants from the Bethlehem church. But Jaeger said
that Italy's concerns were not a stumbling block to resolving the
standoff.</TE>
<TE>   "There is only one issue," Jaeger said. "It is the political will
of Prime Minister Sharon and President Arafat. Everything else is
just window dressing. If they have the political will to bring this
surreal situation to an end, it will be over in a few minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Ten international activists and a Los Angeles Times photographer
joined those inside the church late last week. In telephone
interviews Monday, militants and activists said they had little food
or water left.</TE>
<TE>   "There's weakness, tiredness. Everybody's frazzled due to the
circumstances," Madani said earlier Monday. "The lack of food and the
uncertainty have taken their toll. We hope it will be settled soon."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli snipers have killed at least seven men--most of them armed
militants--in and around the church since the standoff began. Several
others have been wounded. Madani said that inside the church,
"toilets are a disaster. It's inhumane. It's non-hygienic. The church
is beginning to smell in places."</TE>
<TE>   About 200 people sought refuge in the church April 2 as Israeli
troops invaded Bethlehem searching for gunmen. Palestinian policemen,
civilians and officials were swept into the cavernous structure that
day, along with militants.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides have compromised. Israel initially said it would allow
wanted men to choose only between standing trial in Israel and
accepting permanent exile abroad. The Palestinians said they would
never allow any of the men to be exiled or tried in an Israeli court.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians were claiming victory in the standoff, although
the gunmen have been criticized for bearing arms inside a church.</TE>
<TE>   "The Israelis didn't achieve any of their goals, while the people
inside were protecting themselves from death," Madani said. "No one
has been turned in to the Israelis."</TE>
<TE>   But Lt. Col. Olivier Rafowicz, an army spokesman, said Israel had
achieved the goal of protecting, as much as it could, the church
while ensuring that the gunmen inside don't walk free.</TE>
<TE>   Miller and Cole reported from Bethlehem. Times staff writers Mary
Curtius in Jerusalem and Rebecca Trounson and Mark Magnier in
Bethlehem contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>N. Korea Cancels Planned Meeting</HD>
<DH>Asia: The Communist state indignantly cites remarks made by
the South's foreign minister.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>North Korea abruptly pulled out of economic talks with South Korea
that were supposed to begin today, exasperating negotiators who had
believed that the unpredictable Communist state was becoming more
cooperative.</LD>
<LD>   Providing only a day's notice, North Korea issued an indignant
statement saying it wasn't sending a delegation to Seoul as planned
because of remarks last month by South Korea's foreign minister.
Those comments appeared to support the Bush administration's tough
stance toward the North.</LD>
<LD>   The sudden withdrawal was especially disappointing because it came
just days after a round of reunions between separated Korean
families, which was held at the North Korean resort of Mt. Kumgang.</LD>
<TE>   "It clearly takes the wind out of the sails for people who had
high hopes after the reunions of families," said Scott Snyder, Korea
representative of the nonprofit Asia Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   One possible explanation is mounting concern over a dam near Mt.
Kumgang that South Koreans believe is in imminent danger of collapse
and could cause flooding in the border areas.</TE>
<TE>   The South Korean delegation to the economic talks had been
expected to demand the right to inspect the dam--something that might
have caused objections from the North Korean military, which is
resisting the talks with the South.</TE>
<TE>   Puzzled North Korea watchers also suggested that the North had
decided to devote its energy not to talks with South Korea, but with
the United States. Last week, North Korea said that it would reopen
those talks, and U.S. special envoy Jack Pritchard is expected to
visit the capital, Pyongyang, this month.</TE>
<TE>   In its curt statement, the official Korean Central News Agency
decried comments made by Foreign Minister Choi Sung Hong during a
trip to Washington last month. Choi was quoted two weeks ago in the
Washington Post saying, "Sometimes carrying a big stick works in
forcing North Korea to come forward."</TE>
<TE>   The North said that Choi "locked the door to the resumption of
North-South dialogue with his reckless remarks." On Monday, the North
Korean newspaper Rodong Sinmun also described Choi as a "sycophantic
traitor."</TE>
<TE>   The canceled talks were supposed to have been a second round of
the inter-Korean economic cooperation discussions held in December
2000 as a follow-up to the landmark visit of South Korean President
Kim Dae Jung to Pyongyang earlier that year.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the main purpose of the talks was to discuss ways that
prosperous South Korea can help the North rescue its failing economy.
Among the specific items on the agenda were reconnecting rail and
road lines that had been severed during the Korean War, building an
industrial park near the border and the possible donation of South
Korean electricity to the North.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why they canceled, but this is the kind of thing we
are used to with North Korea," said Paik Jin Hyun, a North Korea
specialist at Seoul National University. "I suppose they didn't see
enough of an incentive at this time."</TE>

<DH>Mideast: Making the rounds in Washington, Sharon tries to
discredit Arafat. Saudis and Jordanians plead for a major political
accord to end the fighting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>It was a day of dizzying diplomacy even by Washington standards
Monday as Israeli and Arab leaders whizzed around the capital in
rival motorcades scrambling to have the last word as the United
States tries to jump-start the Middle East peace process.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon spent most of the day trying
to accomplish through diplomacy what couldn't be done with his tanks
and troops--get Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat bumped
from the peace process.</LD>
<LD>   Sharon's closed-doors talks at his hotel with Secretary of State
Colin L. Powell ran long past lunchtime. So Powell later had to grab
a chicken salad sandwich and Diet Coke on the go.</LD>
<TE>   Jordan's King Abdullah II, pushing his plea for a grand political
deal to end a half-century-old conflict, blitzed through sessions
with Powell, Vice President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald
H. Rumsfeld, as well as separate talks with Jewish Americans and Arab
Americans. The king crammed so much into his day that he didn't get
lunch at all.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al Faisal was such a late addition to
the State Department schedule that some in the administration didn't
know he was in Washington until he and Powell held a news briefing at
the State Department.</TE>
<TE>   All three Middle East officials have been here many times. For
Sharon, it was the fifth visit in 17 months. But this time, after a
massive Israeli campaign in the West Bank, the meetings carried the
hint of a possible turning point--of real advantage to be gained or
lost when Sharon sits down with President Bush for their face-to-face
meeting in the Oval Office this afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   The jockeying was frantic--and occasionally nasty. Although the
theme was peace, some of the delegations appeared most intent on
proving that the other side was an unworthy partner.</TE>
<TE>   The sense of tension was particularly prevalent between Israel and
Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli Embassy assembled Washington's diplomatic press corps
for a lengthy briefing to reveal documents alleging that millions of
dollars from Saudi Arabia was deliberately distributed to families of
Palestinian suicide bombers and to the militant Islamic organization
Hamas, one of three groups involved in the recent wave of terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "The Saudi Committee for Support of the Intifada was aware that
the funds it transferred were paid to the families of terrorists who
perpetrated murderous attacks in Israeli cities," said the thick
report handed to the press.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials traveling with Sharon charged that the Saudi
funds in effect provided a motive to carry out attacks--and made
Saudi Arabia a party to terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "If Saudi policy is to finance suicide bombers, then they probably
cannot be part of the peace coalition," Israeli Education Minister
Limor Livnat told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   The news conference took so long that reporters missed the
briefing with Powell and the Saudi foreign minister--at which the
secretary of State praised the Saudis for "important" recent
contributions to the peace process.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia sponsored the Arab League offer to Israel of
normalized relations in exchange for the Jewish state's withdrawal
from occupied territories. Powell said the proposal is one of the
elements of the new U.S. strategy.</TE>
<TE>   But by day's end, Saudi Arabia shot back angrily at the Israelis
with news releases faxed all over town.</TE>
<TE>   Calling the charges "shameful and counterproductive," Saudi
Ambassador Prince Bandar ibn Sultan said in a statement that the
allegations were "a smokescreen intended to distract attention away
from the peace process."</TE>
<TE>   "Israel wants to discredit Saudi Arabia, which has been ... a
catalyst for a peace plan that has been positively received by more
than 60 world leaders."</TE>
<TE>   The statement said Saudi Arabia is committed to aiding 3million
Palestinians "victimized by Israeli violence" by rebuilding schools,
restocking hospitals and restoring electricity, telephones and food
as part of its financial assistance distributed through the United
Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies.</TE>
<TE>   By day's end, Israel hadn't provided the State Department with
copies of its claims about the Saudi aid--leading U.S. officials to
discreetly suggest that the report was in part a public relations
ploy.</TE>
<TE>   A senior U.S. official who asked to remain anonymous said, "We
need the Saudis right now. [The Israelis] need the Saudis right now.
This doesn't make sense."</TE>
<TE>   The dispute illustrated the huge gap that the Bush administration
must bridge before it can organize its proposed international
conference that would include all the region's major players.</TE>
<TE>   In media appearances around town, Sharon advisor Danny Ayalon said
Arafat has "more than three strikes" against him and should be
"definitely out" of the peace process.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with CNN, Ayalon said that asking Israel to
negotiate with Arafat was like asking the United States to negotiate
with Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, during brief remarks while visiting a school in Michigan,
reiterated his disappointment in Arafat. But he made clear that he
believes Arafat still has a role to play. "He must lead," Bush said.
"He must show the world that he believes in peace."</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis also disagree with the administration over the scope
of the proposed conference. They want to avoid a focus on a final
settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and limit new efforts
to interim security arrangements that would be spread over several
years.</TE>
<TE>   "I am for peace, but I am first for security," Sharon said in an
address Monday night to the Anti-Defamation League.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan's King Abdullah, at each of his stops Monday, stressed the
urgency of moving to a final settlement with a well-defined timeline
so that the Palestinian people will have hope.</TE>
<TE>   "Sharon's idea of an interim arrangement and an open-ended process
simply does not work. We can't sell it to anyone in the region," said
a senior Jordanian official traveling with the monarch. "If there's
no commitment to an endgame very soon, then we're not going to be
able to help Arafat stop the radical organizations."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Johanna Neuman and Esther Schrader contributed
to this report.</TE>

<HD>Maverick Dutch Politician Is Slain Before Elections</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn, a populist maverick whose criticism of
immigration and Islam propelled his rapid rise, was shot and killed
Monday outside a radio studio in an Amsterdam suburb.</LD>
<LD>   The assassination, which Dutch authorities said was the first in
the modern history of the Netherlands, came nine days before
legislative elections in which the rightist politician's fledgling
party is a top contender.</LD>
<LD>   The killing was especially shocking because the 54-year-old
Fortuyn, an openly gay sociology professor, was an overnight
phenomenon who had shaken up a tranquil nation with his aggressive
and colorful style.</LD>
<TE>   Police arrested a suspect in the killing, whom they described as a
white man of Dutch nationality, but they didn't identify him or
provide other details. An eyewitness told The Times that the assassin
was a short, youthful man wearing a baseball cap who opened fire at
close range as Fortuyn walked to his car after an interview at the
Radio 3 FM station in the town of Hilversum.</TE>
<TE>   Fortuyn was hit six times in the head, neck and chest, authorities
said. He died on the pavement where he had fallen, surrounded by a
team of paramedics trying to revive him.</TE>
<TE>   His death transformed him into an instant symbol of a Europe
besieged by internal tensions and crises: immigration, street
violence, extremism of many stripes, anti-Semitic and anti-Islamic
sentiment and resentment of traditional leaders seen as out of touch
and unresponsive.</TE>
<TE>   "This was not an attack on Pim Fortuyn but an attack on
democracy," Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok said at a news conference.
"Political differences are resolved not with bullets but with words."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Vander Lugt, coordinator of the radio station, said he
escorted Fortuyn to the exit of the studio and shook hands with him
about 6 p.m. Fortuyn and his chauffeur had walked about 30 yards into
a parking lot when the gunman appeared and fired without a word,
Vander Lugt said.</TE>
<TE>   "I had just said goodbye to Mr. Pim," Vander Lugt said in a
telephone interview. "He walked to the car with one of my disc
jockeys. And a man with a baseball cap started shooting. He was very
close."</TE>
<TE>   Like other rightist leaders gaining ground in Europe, Fortuyn had
called for tough measures against crime and immigration, and curbing
a generous welfare state. He angered opponents with claims that the
country's Islamic community resists integration and poses a risk of
social conflict and that religious fundamentalism is incompatible
with the permissive and tolerant Dutch society.</TE>
<TE>   But he insisted that he wasn't a bigot. He repeatedly condemned
Jean-Marie Le Pen, the veteran far-right candidate who lost France's
presidential election Sunday, for his ties to neo-fascism and
anti-Semitism.</TE>
<TE>   "Right-wing in Holland is left of the [conservative] Tories in
England," Fortuyn said in an interview published in Britain's Daily
Telegraph newspaper Saturday. "I'm not anti-Muslim; I'm not
anti-immigration. I'm saying we've got big problems in our cities.
It's not very smart to make the problem bigger by letting in millions
more immigrants from rural Muslim cultures that don't assimilate."</TE>
<TE>   With his blunt eloquence, chauffeur-driven Daimler and flashy ties
and matching handkerchiefs, Fortuyn attracted voters across the
varied ethnic spectrum of his native Rotterdam, a decaying port town
whose population is about 40% foreign-born. The Netherlands has a
population of 16million people, including an estimated 2million
immigrants, about 800,000 of them Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   Fortuyn charged out of nowhere into Dutch politics when his
neophyte party, Livable Rotterdam, won 17 of 45 city council seats in
March. Saying it was simplistic to call Fortuyn a candidate of
reactionary nationalists, city officials pointed out that Fortuyn's
free-market, law-and-order message won 20% of the votes in a polling
place set up in a mosque.</TE>
<TE>   Admirers said Fortuyn forced a society renowned for tolerant laws
regarding gay marriage, euthanasia, prostitution and drugs to
confront the effect of immigrants on one of Europe's most densely
populated countries. Rather than demanding deportation of immigrants,
as Le Pen has, Fortuyn wanted the Dutch to close borders to new
entrants--"the Netherlands is full," he declared--and work harder at
assimilating foreigners already in the country.</TE>
<TE>   But critics said Fortuyn crossed the line in his best-selling book
about the "Islamicization" of the country and with his comment that
Islam is "a backward culture." He was expelled from his political
party and created a new movement, Pim Fortuyn's List, for the May 15
parliamentary elections.</TE>
<TE>   His charisma stoked the growth of his movement, which included
nonwhite candidates, leading to predictions that he would be a player
in the next government. His aides thought that his accelerating
popularity might propel him to the top. "The chance that he would be
prime minister was growing by the day," his spokesman, Warner Dam,
said in a television interview Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   Along with favorable poll numbers came insults and recent death
threats, "especially from the extreme left," Dam said. "Of course he
was afraid, but he didn't want it to rule his life."</TE>
<TE>   In one recent incident, two assailants hit Fortuyn in the face
with urine-laced pies. Although bodyguards are rare among Dutch
candidates Fortuyn moved with private security guards. The police
kept close watch on Fortuyn's villa in central Rotterdam, Dam said.</TE>

<HD>Milosevic, Kosovo President Face Off</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>THE HAGUE</DL>
<LD>Slobodan Milosevic argued in court Monday with the president of
Kosovo over the root cause of the Kosovo war: Was it an attempt to
create a Greater Albania, or a struggle for freedom by the province's
ethnic Albanian majority.</LD>
<LD>   The former Yugoslav president also argued that he once saved the
life of the newly elected Kosovo leader, Ibrahim Rugova, whom he said
was threatened by ethnic Albanian rivals--a claim that Rugova
disputed.</LD>
<LD>   Milosevic, cross-examining Rugova, who was appearing as a
prosecution witness in the former Yugoslav leader's war crimes trial,
displayed a copy of a map that he said proved the intention to unite
Kosovo, Serbia's southern province, with neighboring Albania.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a map of Greater Albania drawn up by Albanian
nationalists," Milosevic said, waving the map in front of the three
United Nations judges.</TE>
<TE>   "As you can see, it includes the southeast of Montenegro, southern
Serbia, western Macedonia and parts of northern Greece," in addition
to Albania and Kosovo, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Rugova, who led the campaign for Kosovo's independence from
Yugoslavia's larger republic, Serbia, dismissed it as "one of many
alleged maps" and said "there have also been Serbs who wanted to
create a Greater Serbia."</TE>
<TE>   Appearing for the second day at the U.N. war crimes tribunal,
Rugova described years of conflict between Serbs and ethnic Albanians
that escalated into war in 1998-99.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a popular movement, a result of desire by Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian majority to be free," Rugova said.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody has ruled out a future integration," Rugova said, but he
added that "we stride for an independent Kosovo. We cannot change
borders."</TE>
<TE>   Milosevic is accused of five counts of war crimes related to
Kosovo, among the 66 counts he faces, including alleged atrocities in
Croatia and Bosnia during the decade of Yugoslavia's breakup.</TE>
<TE>   Some 800,000 ethnic Albanians were expelled from Kosovo as Serb
troops rampaged from village to village in what Milosevic described
as an attempt to crush a terrorist uprising by Albanian separatists.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, NATO launched an air war to force out Milosevic's troops.
Kosovo is now an international protectorate, with self-rule under the
newly elected Rugova.</TE>

<HD>Activist Hails 'New Dawn' in Myanmar</HD>
<DH>Politics: Aung San Suu Kyi will travel the country to
promote democracy. U.S. lauds government's decision to release her.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>Democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, freed from house arrest Monday by
Myanmar's military government, called her release "a new dawn for the
country" and said she will continue her peaceful struggle for
political change there.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking publicly for the first time in more than 19 months, the
Nobel Peace Prize winner said the government had placed no conditions
on her release. She said she expects to travel soon to different
parts of Myanmar, which was known as Burma before the junta renamed
it.</LD>
<LD>   "I must do everything I can to make sure democracy comes to Burma
quickly, and comes in the right way," Suu Kyi, 56, told a news
conference hours after the regime announced that she was free to
leave her home in Yangon, the capital.</LD>
<TE>   Her release was welcomed by the United States and other nations
that have imposed economic sanctions on the Myanmar dictatorship
because of its suppression of democratic rights.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear, however, whether the regime has any intention of
bringing democracy to the impoverished nation. Some critics contended
that the government released Suu Kyi only to ease international
pressure on Myanmar.</TE>
<TE>   The country has been ruled by a military dictatorship since 1962.
In 1988, the regime ruthlessly suppressed a growing democracy
movement, killing hundreds of people.</TE>
<TE>   Suu Kyi, whose National League for Democracy swept parliamentary
elections in 1990, was never allowed to take power. The charismatic
daughter of Burmese independence leader Aung San was placed under
house arrest in 1989 before the vote and held until 1995.</TE>
<TE>   She was arrested again in September 2000 after she twice tried to
leave Yangon, which was previously known as Rangoon. On Monday, she
said, the military agreed that it will no longer try to prevent her
from leaving the capital.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no restrictions on my movements," she said. "I can go
anywhere I like. This was an agreement on both sides. The important
thing is that I shall be able to go out to meet my people in Rangoon
and around the country in due course of time."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the regime estimate that 1,800 political prisoners
remain behind bars, and have called for their release. Suu Kyi
reiterated that demand Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "I and my party have been disappointed by the slow rate of release
of political prisoners," she said. "Their release is not only
important in humanitarian terms but also political terms."</TE>
<TE>   Suu Kyi, who was mobbed by more than 1,000 supporters as she
arrived at her party headquarters for the news conference, was muted
in her criticism of the government and sought to set the stage for
future negotiations. "We are looking for solid agreement that will
lead to a better life for the people of Burma," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Col. Hla Min, a government spokesman, said Suu Kyi's release from
house arrest signaled "the end of the confrontation era" and a new
period of cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   United Nations envoy Razali Ismail, a Malaysian diplomat who
helped negotiate her freedom, predicted that the government will hold
elections in two or three years. Many of Suu Kyi's supporters,
however, weren't convinced that her release signaled a fundamental
change by the government. Critics of the regime predicted that there
will be no quick lifting of sanctions, which include an investment
ban, arms embargo and a freeze on aid from international donors and
lenders.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, the Free Burma Coalition, which has
pressured major corporations to pull out of Myanmar, cautiously
welcomed Suu Kyi's release.</TE>
<TE>   "The release by itself means very little," said Jeremy Woodrum,
director of the coalition's Washington office. "It's important to
remember she was released in 1995 after six years and nothing
changed. We don't want her release to be just her moving to a bigger
cage."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Cites Cuban Bioweapons Effort</HD>
<DH>Security: Havana might be passing germ weapons know-how to
'rogue' states, official says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A senior Bush administration official said Monday that U.S. leaders
have underestimated the security threat posed by Cuba, and he issued
a specific warning about the country's biological weapons program.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. officials believe that Cuba has "at least a limited offensive
biological warfare research and development effort," said John R.
Bolton, undersecretary of State for arms control and international
security. And they fear that the Cubans might be passing on their
germ weapons know-how to other "rogue" states, he said in a speech at
the Heritage Foundation, a conservative public policy center in
Washington.</LD>
<LD>   The comments represent a marked toughening of the official line on
Cuba. The Castro regime has long been listed by the U.S. government
as a state sponsor of terrorism, and officials have said that Cuba
was believed to have the capability to produce germ agents. But,
until now, government officials have given this danger little
emphasis. And they have not indicated that Cuba might be an important
source of germ-weapon knowledge for other countries.</LD>
<TE>   The new warnings brought charges from some analysts that the
administration was trying to strengthen its political support from
anti-Castro Cubans in Florida and other conservatives. Florida is
important to President Bush's reelection prospects, and his brother,
Gov. Jeb Bush, is facing an election in November.</TE>
<TE>   Bolton said that the worries about Cuba arise from its
"well-developed and sophisticated" biomedical industry, which until
1990 had substantial support from the Soviet Union. The equipment
used to manufacture pharmaceutical or agricultural products is
considered "dual use," meaning that it can also be applied to create
germ weapon agents, such as viruses and toxins.</TE>
<TE>   Bolton said Cuba "has provided dual-use technology to other rogue
states. We are concerned that such technology could support
biological warfare programs in those states."</TE>
<TE>   Bolton did not specify which nations Havana might have aided, but
he noted that Cuban President Fidel Castro visited Iran, Syria and
Libya last year. Bolton said that Castro told an audience at Tehran
University, "Iran and Cuba, in cooperation with each other, can bring
America to its knees."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have underestimated the threat posed by Cuba in
large part because of the work of Cuban spies operating in the United
States, Bolton declared.</TE>
<TE>   He cited Ana Belen Montes, a longtime Defense Intelligence Agency
analyst who pleaded guilty in March to spying for Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Montes was a contributor to a key 1998 Pentagon report that
reviewed Cuba's military capabilities. The report concluded that the
island did not pose a substantial security threat to the United
States--though then-Defense Secretary William S. Cohen acknowledged
that he was "concerned" about the germ weapons program.</TE>
<TE>   "Why was the 1998 report on Cuba so unbalanced? Why did it
underplay the threat Cuba posed to the United States?" Bolton asked.
"A major reason is Cuba's aggressive intelligence operations against
the United States."</TE>
<TE>   There is disagreement over how much proof exists that Cuba is
developing a dangerous germ weapons capability.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Johnson, a specialist on Latin American affairs at
Heritage Foundation, said some Cuban migrants have pointed to such
dangers.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said U.S. officials' suspicions have also been aroused by
the fact that Cuba has spent millions on sophisticated biomedical
gear, even though it often has shortages of basic medical products.</TE>
<TE>   Some other analysts scoffed at the suggestion that Cuba could be
trying to develop such weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a
Washington research center on Latin American affairs, said there has
been scant evidence that Cuba was developing such a program.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just nuts," he said. "If [Bolton] has any evidence for
this, he ought to make it public. Otherwise it's just a smear
tactic."</TE>
<TE>   Julia E. Sweig, deputy director for Latin American studies at the
Council on Foreign Relations, a New York-based research center, said
the remarks indicate that the Bush administration, under pressure
from anti-Castro Cuban Americans to show stronger support for their
cause, is looking for a way to make its Cuba policy more distinctive
from the Clinton administration's.</TE>
<TE>   She noted that President Bush is planning an address May 20 in
Miami that is expected to make a major statement on Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   "I would read this politically," she said.</TE>

<HD>A Human Touch for Machines</HD>
<DH>The radical movement of affective computing is turning the
field of artificial intelligence upside down by adding emotion to the
equation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>If the face is a window into the soul, then Javier Movellan has
peered deeply into the human condition.</LD>
<LD>   His research team has studied more than 100,000 faces, analyzing
each one for the smallest shifts in facial muscles--a lexicon of
emotional expression. A computer scans the faces 30 times a second
and then squirrels away the information in a bulging databank.</LD>
<LD>   Pausing to gather his thoughts, Movellan rubs his eyes and
contemplates the face of the young woman on his computer screen. She
seems cheerful, but her eyes squint slightly--a hint of vexation?</LD>
<TE>   There is no quick way for Movellan to say, but somewhere in the
trillions of bits of information stored in his computer, he is
convinced, there is an answer.</TE>
<TE>   For the last decade, the UC San Diego psychologist has traveled a
quixotic path in search of the next evolutionary leap in computer
development: training machines to comprehend the deeply human mystery
of what we feel.</TE>
<TE>   Movellan's devices now can identify hundreds of ways faces
show joy, anger, sadness and other emotions. The computers, which
operate by recognizing patterns learned from a multitude of images,
eventually will be able to detect millions of expressions.</TE>
<TE>   Scanning dozens of points on a face, the devices see everything,
including what people may try to hide: an instant of confusion or a
fleeting grimace that betrays a cheerful front.</TE>
<TE>   Such computers are the beginnings of a radical movement known as
"affective computing." The goal is to reshape the very notion of
machine intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   It finds inspiration in Hal, the eerily alluring supercomputer of
"2001: A Space Odyssey," which transcended mere computation with
astute emotional skills and even a sense of duty. Compared with its
impassive astronaut companions, Hal seemed the most human figure in
the 1968 film.</TE>
<TE>   Affective computing would transform machines from slaves chained
to the limits of logic into thoughtful, observant collaborators. Such
devices may never replicate human emotional experience.</TE>
<TE>   But if their developers are correct, even modest emotional talents
would change machines from data-crunching savants into perceptive
actors in human society. At stake are multibillion-dollar markets for
electronic tutors, robots, advisors and even psychotherapy
assistants.</TE>
<TE>   With other pioneers of this new realm, Movellan, a quiet,
41-year-old Spaniard, is turning the field of artificial
intelligence, or AI, upside down.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, computer scientists have pursued the holy grail of
AI: a thinking machine. Their efforts have produced devices of
astonishing sophistication.</TE>
<TE>   Yet each new generation of technology follows a pattern set by the
first digital computer, the "analytical engine" designed by
mathematician Charles Babbage in 1833.</TE>
<TE>   Redefining What</TE>
<TE>   It Means to Feel</TE>
<TE>   Classical AI researchers model the mind through the brute force of
infinite logical calculations. But they falter at humanity's
fundamental motivations. Romantic love can be as irrational as it is
compelling. And every teacher knows the futility of logic for
resolving playground disputes, as do diplomats in conflicts between
nations.</TE>
<TE>   Movellan is part of a growing network of scientists working to
disprove long-held assumptions that computers are, by nature, logical
geniuses but emotional dunces.</TE>
<TE>   The ability to interpret markers for emotion--facial expressions,
vocal tones and metabolic responses such as blood pressure--may seem
like crude first steps.</TE>
<TE>   Yet experts see machine intelligence, unswayed by human frailty and
bias, as an eventual advantage.  They envision machines that know us
better than we know ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   No one can say whether such a goal will be achieved.  Some say that
without the ability to experience emotions--far beyond today's
technology--perceptive machines would offer simplistic, unreliable
readings of human feelings.  Others recoil at the prospect, suggesting
that if machines perceive, store and catalog people's emotional responses,
they would open a new assault on personal privacy.</TE>
<TE>   But if scientists are right about the potential of today's
research, emotion machines would force a debate that could redefine
intelligence, artificial or human, and shed new light on the core of
humanness--what it means to feel.</TE>
<TE>   "Modern AI is offering us [a] realization that ... the essence of
intelligence is in our capacity to perceive patterns, deal with
uncertainty and operate successfully in the natural world," Movellan
said. "Emotional processes may be a form of intelligence more complex
and important than we ever imagined."</TE>
<TE>   Affective computing updates an age-old fascination. In some
versions of the ancient Jewish myth, the clay creature Golem gains
human desires when a slip of paper inscribed with the name of God is
placed in its mouth. Like Pinocchio and Frankenstein's monster, Golem
is a touchstone for the often frightful preoccupation with turning
inanimate objects into sentient beings.</TE>
<TE>   The word "robot" (Czech for "forced labor") was coined in a 1920
stage play in which machines assume the drudgery of factory
production, then develop feelings and turn against their makers. Hal
in "2001" was programmed with intuition and empathy to keep
astronauts company, only to become a murderer.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists don't foresee machines with Hal's emotional skills--or,
fortunately, its malevolence--soon. But they already have debunked AI
orthodoxy considered sacrosanct only five years ago--that logic is
the one path to machine intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   It took psychologists and neuroscientists--outside the computer
priesthood--to see inherent limits in the mathematical pursuit of
intelligence that has dominated computer science.</TE>
<TE>   For Terry Sejnowski, director of the Institute for Neural
Computation at UCSD and Movellan's mentor, the pursuit of emotion
machines began a decade ago when he viewed Sexnet, a program designed
to distinguish male from female faces that had been stripped of
cultural cues such as hair and cosmetics. In a test against people,
the computer proved the better judge.</TE>
<TE>   Sejnowski began to imagine computers that see past faces to the
emotions behind them. Now he and Movellan are helping to create a
digital compendium of human emotion--"a catalog of how people react
to the world."</TE>
<TE>   The basis of that catalog is a coding system developed in the
1970s by UC San Francisco psychologist Paul Ekman, who classified
dozens of facial muscle movements into 44 discrete units--phonemes of
emotional expression.</TE>
<TE>   These "action units" define the meaning of raised eyebrows and
furrowed brows. Experts in Ekman's method recognize combinations of
movements that correspond to dozens of variations on basic
expressions--such as joy, surprise, anger, fear, sadness and
disgust--interpreted with remarkable consistency across human
cultures.</TE>
<TE>   Movellan's team videotapes subjects who show a range of emotions.
The researchers feed the images into a computer, then use
pattern-recognition software to train the computer to make Ekman
assessments and to generalize from one person to the next.</TE>
<TE>   Smiles and wrinkles are only first steps. Researchers are adding
body language, vocal tones, speech recognition and metabolic signals
to give computers a richer mix from which to draw conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have
fashioned earrings to measure blood volume pressure and shoes to
monitor the electrical conductivity of the feet--much the way a lie
detector works. About 80% of the time, a computer correctly relates
such data to emotional states, such as joy and anger.</TE>
<TE>   Perceptive machines soon may assist even top clinicians. The
keenest human observer often misses or misinterprets revealing yet
ephemeral expressions.</TE>
<TE>   The computer, however, never blinks. Recording a fleeting grimace
can solve a standard therapeutic dilemma: deciding what a patient is
really feeling, even when the patient is unsure.</TE>
<TE>   And computers are free of the psychological baggage that clouds
human perceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Cohn, a University of Pittsburgh psychologist and pioneer
in machine perception, said one of his researchers is exploring these
techniques to quantify conflict in schizophrenics, whose feelings and
expressions are often out of sync.</TE>
<TE>   "Clinicians may sense that something is not quite right but be
unable to describe it," he said. "By creating a tool that can perform
these kinds of analyses, we expand the therapist's repertoire."</TE>
<TE>   His colleague has found that while normal people raise their
eyebrows in surprise or delight, schizophrenics do so randomly. Such
insights could lead to early intervention for at-risk patients.</TE>
<TE>   From Helpful</TE>
<TE>   to Obnoxious</TE>
<TE>   Psychology provides inspiration for emotion machines, but their
success depends on commercialization. Consider Pod, a concept car
from Toyota Motor Corp. and Sony Corp., with features straight out of
the sci-fi cartoon "The Jetsons."</TE>
<TE>   Pod, short for "personalization on demand," is a cross between a
video game and a lie detector. It "attempts to monitor not only
driver preferences but the driver's state of mind," said Dave
Hermance, Toyota's top environmental engineer.</TE>
<TE>   At the driver's right, a silver joystick replaces the steering
wheel and pedals for complete one-handed control. The question is:
Who's controlling whom?</TE>
<TE>   Switch on the ignition, and the car begins to monitor your heart
rate and perspiration through joystick sensors. A computer records
your driving habits.</TE>
<TE>   "If over time it notices that your driving is erratic"--rapid
acceleration followed by sudden braking or sharp turns--"Pod plays
soothing music and blows air in your face, cooling you down from your
excited state," Hermance said.</TE>
<TE>   Hermance allows that some features may cross the line from helpful
to obnoxious.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are really driving badly, it pulls over to the curb. If it
did that to me, I'd shoot it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pod may not hit the freeways for a while, but the burgeoning
robotics market already is emotion-driven. Sony's dog-bot Aibo--an
expensive electronic "pet"--uses lights, sounds and gestures to
portray joy and fear in response to praise or scolding.</TE>
<TE>   Such primitive skills gradually will be replaced by accurate
perceptions of a broad range of moods and emotions.</TE>
<TE>   The largest commercial effect of emotion machines might be on
marketing, experts say--focus groups based not on what people say
about a product, but on what they feel.</TE>
<TE>   Skeptics see the potential of perceptive machines. But they view
computers that have genuine understanding and the ability to credibly
mimic a human response--a likely outcome of today's work, some
experts say--as farfetched if not dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   Critics See Danger</TE>
<TE>   to Personal Privacy</TE>
<TE>   Just as standard computers solve complex equations by chopping
them into millions of pieces, emotion machines divide human
characteristics--facial gestures, voice tones and sweat--into bits of
emotional data to categorize.</TE>
<TE>   But understanding is a far different and more difficult process.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't get emotions by manipulating 0s and 1s," said John
Searle, a UC Berkeley philosopher known for challenging the
intellectual underpinnings of AI. "Simulation of digestion won't
digest pizza."</TE>
<TE>   Psychiatrists say emotional responses that sometimes cause us to
misinterpret others' intent may paradoxically ensure that machines
never equal humanity's perceptive skills. How we feel about other
people suggests how they affect others.</TE>
<TE>   Ronnie Stangler, chairwoman of the American Psychiatric Assn.'s
technology committee, said top clinicians realize that "it's the
richness of our history, our personal experience and our
relationships that make us ... appreciate the emotional state in the
larger context of a person's life."</TE>
<TE>   But the ability of perceptive machines to quantify emotions provides a
strong incentive for corporations or governments to capture the data.</TE>
<TE>   Stangler said the prospect opens a range of new dangers concerning
personal privacy.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you imagine those same credit bureaus that know the size
of our mortgage and our credit card debt knowing also how anxious we
are?" Stangler said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, actual understanding of emotions may not be required to
fundamentally transform our relationships with machines.</TE>
<TE>   The last time humanity was forced to recast its assumptions about
technology was during the Industrial Revolution, when machines went
from enhancing human abilities to exceeding them--from helper to
replacement. The shock provoked generations of social and economic
dislocation.</TE>
<TE>   The digital revolution has been less disorienting. Today's devices
are still servants ruled by logic.</TE>
<TE>   Emotion machines could end that implicit social contract between
people and machines and create a perplexing new one.</TE>
<TE>   "If robots are visibly sad, bored or angry, humans, starting with
children, will react to them as persons," writes John McCarthy, an AI
pioneer at Stanford University and a critic of emotion machines.</TE>
<TE>   "Human society is complicated enough already."</TE>

<HD>Memo Shows Enron Role in Hiking Prices</HD>
<DH>Electricity: 'Smoking gun' document by company lawyers
reveals tactics that helped create energy shortage in California last
year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, THOMAS S. MULLIGAN and TIM REITERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Enron documents released Monday show the company sought to manipulate
power prices in California, creating artificial shortages through the
use of aggressive trading tactics during the energy crisis.</LD>
<LD>   The disclosure by federal energy regulators marks the first time
that a company's own documents have provided clear evidence of market
manipulation, critics said, which contributed to soaring prices and
blackouts.</LD>
<LD>   "What we have here is a blueprint of ... manipulation," said
Robert McCullough, a Portland energy consultant and economist. "It's
one thing for economists to state that these things are happening....
It's another thing for there to be internal documents on the table
stating these things are happening."</LD>
<TE>   The documents, uncovered as part of investigation by the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission into possible manipulation of
California's electricity market, are seen as strengthening the
state's hand in renegotiating costly long-term contracts with
electricity sellers that were reached during the worst of
California's energy crisis in early 2001.</TE>
<TE>   California Democratic Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein
both called for a Justice Department investigation, with Boxer saying
the documents "confirm what I've been saying for months, that Enron
manipulated the California energy market and needs to be held
accountable. It is high time we see some indictments handed down in
this case."</TE>
<TE>   Although Feinstein said the trading practices may violate federal
fraud statutes, energy experts saw the strategies as infractions of
market rules that are punishable by fines or suspensions rather than
criminal prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   The state's grid operator has sought a variety of remedies from
FERC for such practices and received some relief in June in the form
of price caps throughout the West and other mitigation measures.</TE>
<TE>   Enron lawyer Robert Bennett said company executives, under new
leadership after Enron's Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing, gave the documents
to the government and waived attorney-client privilege because "they
thought it was the right thing to do. The truth of the matter is, we
don't know what the truth of the underlying facts are" in the memos.</TE>
<TE>   Power shortages sent prices skyrocketing in May 2000, which pushed
California's two largest privately held electricity utilities to the
edge of ruin, caused six days of statewide blackouts and forced the
state to buy power for more than 10million utility customers.</TE>
<TE>   Enron and other power sellers have denied that they manipulated
prices or power supplies, contending that the energy crisis was
caused by a shortage of power plants and hydroelectricity.</TE>
<TE>   "These documents make it clear that Enron was trying to squeeze
every dime it could out of the market. It's not surprising that they
violated [California Independent System Operator] rules because the
ISO don't provide much punishment for violators," said Severin
Borenstein, a UC Berkeley professor and director of the UC Energy
Institute.</TE>
<TE>   One memo, dated Dec. 6, 2000, and prepared by an Enron staff
attorney and an outside lawyer in anticipation of investigations and
lawsuits, explained how Enron traders exploited loopholes or market
limitations to boost prices or to wring special payments out of the
agencies that operated California's electricity markets.</TE>
<TE>   Enron traders used such price-hiking techniques as sham congestion
on electricity lines or selling electricity to out-of-state
affiliates only to re-import it at higher prices, the memo said.</TE>
<TE>   One strategy, code-named Death Star, "earns money by scheduling
transmission in the opposite direction of congestion," the Dec. 6
memo said. "No energy, however, is actually put onto the grid or
taken off."</TE>
<TE>   A second undated memo, written by a different law firm, sought to
cast a more favorable light on the strategies discussed in the first
memo.</TE>
<TE>   The second memo defended the Death Star strategy, saying it
actually reduced congestion on electricity lines at times and
increased supply along underused electricity lines.</TE>
<TE>   The Dec. 6 memo also claimed that other traders had begun copying
Enron's techniques, many of which have been identified by California
officials, although without documented evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the smoking guns we always alleged," said Public
Utilities Commission President Loretta M. Lynch. "These documents
show their business plan was to game the California market so they
could suck every dollar out of California."</TE>
<TE>   Department of Water Resources spokesman Oscar Hidalgo said the
department hopes the release of the Enron documents will spur more
companies to renegotiate dozens of long-term contracts that DWR
signed after it became the power buyer for customers of financially
troubled utilities.</TE>
<TE>   The California Independent System Operator, which runs
California's last remaining official energy market, has asked FERC to
grant the state $9 billion in refunds because prices charged in 2000
and 2001 were unreasonable, although the regulators now are
considering a lower payment.</TE>
<TE>   The quirks of the California energy market presented Enron and
other market participants with myriad opportunities to take
profitable advantage.</TE>
<TE>   California had two markets: a "day-ahead" auction market through
the California Power Exchange--"the PX," in trader lingo--and the
"real-time" market run by Cal-ISO.</TE>
<TE>   Traders quickly found ways to play the two markets off each other.</TE>
<TE>   The day-ahead market was supposed to handle the bulk of the
electricity requirements, and the real-time market was meant only to
correct occasional imbalances.</TE>
<TE>   When the crisis hit, the real-time market grew in importance and
was the locus of wild price swings.</TE>
<TE>   Buyers and sellers who wanted to participate in the real-time
market were required to submit to Cal-ISO daily schedules of their
production and their "load," or the amount of power they intended to
use. The two were supposed to be in balance.</TE>
<TE>   But sometimes when power supply was tight, Cal-ISO paid
participants a premium when they happened to provide more power than
Cal-ISO required.</TE>
<TE>   One of Enron's basic strategies, according to the memo, involved
deliberately overstating its load. It would deliver as much power as
promised but then use less than scheduled and get a premium for the
difference.</TE>
<TE>   Another Enron stratagem was to take advantage of congestion in the
real-time market that Enron had helped create in the day-ahead
market, the memo said.</TE>
<TE>   During the energy crisis, the amount of power scheduled for
delivery into the California market sometimes exceeded the capacity
of the system's transmission lines.</TE>
<TE>   At such times, Cal-ISO would make "congestion payments" to market
participants that either schedule transmission in the opposite
direction or reduce their generation/load schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "Because the congestion charges have been as high as $750/MW [per
megawatt], it can often be profitable to sell power at a loss simply
to collect the congestion payment," the memo said.</TE>
<TE>   Enron traders, acknowledged as among the industry's most creative,
worked a number of variations on these two themes. In addition to
Death Star, other colorful nicknames for trading methods included Get
Shorty, Ricochet and Fat Boy to identify them in discussions with
traders from other firms.</TE>
<TE>   California imposed price caps to cope with the emergency, but even
these offered an opportunity for clever traders who realized that
prices weren't capped in neighboring areas that were affected by the
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 5, 2000, for example, prices soared to $1,200 per
megawatt-hour in the Pacific Northwest, while a $250 cap was in place
in California.</TE>
<TE>   Enron traders saw that they could lock in an instant $950 profit
for each megawatt-hour of electricity by buying power on the
California PX and selling it up north, according to the memo.</TE>
<TE>   "This strategy appears not to present any problems, other than a
public relations risk from the fact that such exports may have
contributed to California's declaration of a Stage 2 emergency
yesterday," the memo said.</TE>
<TE>   Cal-ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle said some of the behaviors
probably caused prices to rise, but the grid operator does not
believe they contributed to the six days of blackouts in early 2001.
The reason, she said, is that the blackouts were caused by a severe
shortage of power, not by phantom congestion.</TE>
<TE>   Cal-ISO has asked FERC to extend market protections that are due
to expire Sept. 30, including a price cap on electricity in the West.</TE>

<HD>Hollywood Sizing Up Firm's Grasp</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Deal with Ovitz gives music management
company a broader base of power.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFF BOUCHER and CORIE BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Firm, the generically named talent management company that began
in a Malibu apartment in 1997, has raced through the music industry
with the velocity of a bullet train, picking up some of the very
biggest names in pop music. Now, after scooping up entertainment
mogul Michael Ovitz's remaining empire, the wild ride is headed down
a new track: Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   The Firm has long been the talk of the music business because of
the aggressive style and unyielding appetites of its chief executive,
Jeff Kwatinetz, a lanky Harvard law graduate with a famous temper.</LD>
<LD>   To Kwatinetz's stellar list of music clients, including Limp
Bizkit, Korn, Mary J. Blige, Linkin Park and the Dixie Chicks, he
will add the Tiffany collection from Ovitz's Artist Management
Group--Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz, Samuel L. Jackson and Benicio
Del Toro.</LD>
<TE>   This latest deal comes after Kwatinetz has expanded his company
into everything from sneakers to teddy bears to record labels. Now
film and television players will be sizing him up. "You can't take
your eyes off the guy," one music manager said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Kwatinetz does not enjoy the scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday the 37-year-old declined to answer questions about the
nature and breadth of his plans and said he would prefer to emphasize
"the team" of the Firm, not the name of its CEO.</TE>
<TE>   "There's lot of work ahead. It's not an easy thing to take on a
lot of people and integrate two cultures," the Brooklyn-born manager
said. "I get uncomfortable when people focus on Jeff Kwatinetz. I'm
reluctant to speak about myself because the Firm and this deal ...
have nothing to do with Jeff Kwatinetz. They have to do with the
amazing team of people here. And things we believe we can do for the
best clients in the entertainment business."</TE>
<TE>   This week the Firm announced that it will gobble up much of
Ovitz's Artists Management Group, which Ovitz had hoped would
reinvent the basic blueprint of entertainment companies. Echoing some
of Ovitz's ambitions, the Firm will look toward becoming a venture
that not only negotiates record contracts, but also has its hand in
brand marketing and filmmaking.</TE>
<TE>   The Ovitz dream fizzled, in part, because much of Hollywood
delighted in thwarting his plan for a multifaceted company that would
produce and distribute movies and television shows for his clients.</TE>
<TE>   Although the boundaries of Kwatinetz's plans are still hazy, some
who have watched him scale the heights of the music business say he,
too, may have burned too many bridges to build a new-look empire.</TE>
<TE>   Two top music executives, for example, on Monday characterized
Kwatinetz's negotiating style as abrasive and, ultimately, damaging
to his own clients. They say he is known for behind-the-scenes
threats of litigation against record companies and regularly demands
exorbitant advances for his music acts.</TE>
<TE>   But other executives such as Jimmy Iovine, whose Interscope Group
releases music by Firm acts Limp Bizkit and Puddle of Mudd,
characterize Kwatinetz as a champion of his clients.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy is relentless," Iovine said. "He gives it all every
minute. His attention to detail is ridiculous. The dynamic between
him and [Bizkit lead singer] Fred Durst and [Geffen Records
President] Jordan Schur is something that I haven't seen in rock 'n'
roll in a long time. It's high octane. I'm glad it's in my boat."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Whalley, chairman of Warner Bros. Records, called the manager
unflinching and inventive. "Jeff has no fear to try things no one has
ever done," Whalley said. "He's not afraid of failure whatsoever--and
that is how he has become so successful so quickly."</TE>
<TE>   The trajectory of his success makes some critics wonder if
Kwatinetz can make it all last. His most lucrative client, the
Backstreet Boys, left the Firm two months ago. (They signed with
Irving Azoff, another hardball manager, who represents the Eagles.)
The Firm's overhead is rumored to be high, more than $2 million a
month, with 130 employees.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, the Firm, co-founded by Kwatinetz and Michael Green,
has compiled an impressive client list that at one time included
Michael Jackson. The meteoric success of acts such as Limp Bizkit and
Staind was credited by industry observers to the Firm's hands-on
detail work, and the company also crafted a successful path for the
Backstreet Boys.</TE>
<TE>   Although some of his critics say Kwatinetz is more concerned with
his reputation than his clients' career health, he has described
himself as a manager who wants to harvest the careers of artists, not
strip-mine them. In an interview with The Times last year, he said he
fought against promoters who wanted to book the Backstreet Boys in
stadiums instead of arenas. The larger venues would have made for a
bigger payday but would have failed to sell out, undermining the
group's health as performers.</TE>
<TE>   "That cost my company $6 million in commissions on the tour and
another $2 million in [merchandise] and I just wonder how many
managers would take $8 million out of their pocket to do the right
thing by their group," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kwatinetz, who bought out Green's partnership interest in the
Firm, wants his company to be far more than a music management
venture.</TE>
<TE>   The Firm bought the near-defunct Pony sneaker brand, a hot brand
in the 1970s after athletes such as Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier and
Earl Campbell sported the shoe.</TE>
<TE>   Firm officials now say Pony sales, $2 million last year, are
expected to reach $50 million in wholesale sales for 2002.</TE>
<TE>   After that deal, Kwatinetz took a 50% stake in the marketing
rights to Build-a-Bear Workshop, a mall-based chain with sales of
$158 million that lets kids design their own stuffed animals.
Kwatinetz also has a deal to merchandise Arthur, the polite cartoon
aardvark. And the firm is involved in a film production company and a
record label.</TE>
<TE>   Some wonder if the Firm may be spreading itself too thin.</TE>
<TE>   Haim Saban, the billionaire television mogul who cashed in on the
Power Rangers craze, said he opted not to invest in the Firm after
discussing business plans with Kwatinetz to build a far-reaching
entertainment empire.</TE>
<TE>   "The fundamentals weren't there," Saban said. "I believe this is
an industry of giants. You can do really well as a well-focused small
player, like [computer animator] Pixar, but to launch a multifaceted
company and really compete with the big ones, that was a battle that
... I didn't think I could win."</TE>
<TE>   Although Kwatinetz has been a successful fighter in the music
business, he also has suffered some bruises along the way. He had to
return $25 million to Robert Sillerman of media firm FXM after a
merger with the Firm turned sour.</TE>
<TE>   Kwatinetz's dream of reviving Michael Jackson's career fell short
and they parted ways in short order. There also was an ugly split
with former employer Sandy Gallin, who Kwatinetz claimed was a sexual
harasser in a lawsuit. Gallin denied the charges and the suit was
dropped.</TE>
<TE>   By the numbers, the Firm looks good. According to Forbes magazine,
the company has a stable of actors and musicians that in 2000
generated more than $1.5 billion in gross revenue. Kwatinetz hopes to
build on that.</TE>
<TE>   The harsh appraisals of Kwatinetz's plans are premature and
off-base, said Julie Silverman-Yorn, his new partner as a result of
the merger. Silverman-Yorn and her brother-in-law, Rick Yorn, are
taking 40 of their best managers--from the film, television, music
and publishing arenas--over from AMG to the Firm.</TE>
<TE>   "We will be judged by our work," Silverman-Yorn said. "I really
believe that this group is smart, entrepreneurial, young, thinks out
of the box, really protect their clients' interests. That's why we
did this."</TE>
<TE>   Others took a wait-and-see approach.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a very smart, ambitious guy," said Jim Wiatt, head of the
William Morris Agency. "A very successful music guy whose ambition is
to make movies." He'll be able to attract money to build something
interesting, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Talent manager Marty Bauer said he believes there will be a fair
amount of fallout from the merger of AMG and the Firm affecting both
agents and clients.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be a ripple effect," said Bauer, predicting, "A lot of
the managers that are let go will become agents and therefore they
will try to take their clients away."</TE>
<TE>   Bauer doubted that the balance of power and the management
business would be affected. "Not even close," he said. But he
acknowledged that Kwatinetz and company are creating conversation for
the power lunch set.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the perfect Hollywood story. It's something to talk about
and gossip about. It's fun," he said.</TE>

<HD>Court OKs Taping of Inmates</HD>
<DH>Ruling: State justices say prosecutors may order the secret
recording of calls and visits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Conversations between jailhouse inmates and their visitors may be
secretly tape-recorded in California to gather criminal evidence, the
state Supreme Court decided unanimously Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Ruling in a matricide case, the high court said that prosecutors
may order the taping of communications during jailhouse visits and
play the tapes at the inmate's trial as evidence. A 1982 state
Supreme Court precedent that barred such eavesdropping is no longer
valid, the court said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "California law now permits law enforcement officers to monitor
and record unprivileged communications between inmates and their
visitors to gather evidence of crimes," Justice Janice Rogers Brown
wrote for the court.</LD>
<TE>   The ruling comes at a time of increasing debate over efforts by
authorities to listen in on jailhouse conversations.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government recently granted federal law enforcement
officers limited authority to listen to inmates' conversations with
their lawyers in cases of suspected terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Communications between inmates and their lawyers will remain
privileged in California jails and prisons and are illegal to tape.
The 1982 precedent that prohibited the taping of other communications
in jail, De Lancie vs. Superior Court, was based on a state law that
previously gave inmates greater rights than they have today, the
court said.</TE>
<TE>   "Now in the wake of Sept. 11, when [Atty. Gen. John] Ashcroft is
attempting to tape visits between defendants and even their own
lawyers, we have come a long way since the day that De Lancie was
decided," said Michael McMahon, who represented an association of
criminal defense lawyers in Monday's case.</TE>
<TE>   An Alameda County prosecutor who had ordered the taping in the
case that was decided Monday said the ruling proves that he acted
ethically.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel vindicated and exonerated by the Supreme Court opinion,"
said Assistant Dist. Atty. Thomas Rogers, whom a lower court had
previously found committed misconduct by seeking the surveillance.
"They have held that not only was there no misconduct, but also that
I was correct in my belief that De Lancie had been overruled" by the
Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   In 1975, the Legislature passed a prisoners' bill of rights that
gave inmates the right to private visits. The Supreme Court, presided
over by the liberal Chief Justice Rose Bird, based its decision in De
Lancie on that law, ruling that taping could be done only for penal
safety--to prevent escapes, for example. The Legislature changed that
part of the law in 1994, paving the way for Monday's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers prosecuted Christine Loyd, 57, who was sentenced to 55
years to life for the 1991 murder of her mother and the 1994 killing
of a friend whose finances Loyd managed.</TE>
<TE>   Loyd was in an Alameda County jail on the 1994 murder charge when
Rogers, suspicious about the death of Loyd's mother three years
earlier, ordered the taping of Loyd's calls and visits.</TE>
<TE>   The death of Myrtle Loyd, 76, had been classified an accident. She
was found in a bathtub with several cuts on her head. Rogers believed
that Christine Loyd killed her mother for money, although friends and
family members said the two had enjoyed good relations.</TE>
<TE>   Without obtaining a warrant from a judge, Rogers had Loyd's
communications with visitors and her outgoing telephone calls taped
for three months in 1996. He said prosecutors frequently did such
taping in jails.</TE>
<TE>   Loyd objected to the tapes at trial, but the judge ruled for the
prosecution. A Court of Appeal in San Francisco later held that
Rogers had committed prosecutorial misconduct by ordering the taping
but left Loyd's convictions intact and imposed no sanctions on
Rogers.</TE>
<TE>   The state Supreme Court rejected the charge of prosecutorial
misconduct. "We find the prosecutor's request for and use of the tape
did not constitute misconduct under the law," Brown wrote for the
court.</TE>
<TE>   The court declined to decide whether the taping of Loyd's calls to
her brother and a friend outside the jail might have violated federal
law. Loyd's lawyer did not object on that point, and the issue was
not procedurally before the court.</TE>
<TE>   Although the court majority was silent on the federal law, Justice
Carlos R. Moreno wrote separately to warn that law enforcement still
must comply with Title III of the federal Omnibus Crime Control and
Safe Streets Act of 1968. That law prohibits the wiretapping of
inmates' telephone calls to people outside the institution unless the
prisoners have been told that such monitoring may occur.</TE>
<TE>   Notice could include warnings posted by jailhouse telephones, a
signed acknowledgment form or a recorded message that is heard by the
inmate when he or she picks up the telephone, said Moreno, who was
joined by Justice Joyce L. Kennard.</TE>
<TE>   In Loyd's case, a recorded warning system was malfunctioning at
the jail during the time some of her telephone calls were recorded.</TE>
<TE>   Although all inmates were supposed to have received pamphlets
warning them that their calls might be recorded, it was unclear
whether Loyd received the admonishment, Moreno wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Although prosecutors may now tape in-house conversations between
inmates and their visitors, which often occur between glass barriers
and with the aid of a telephone, law enforcement still must comply
with the federal law monitoring telephone calls inmates make to the
outside, Moreno said.</TE>
<TE>   "The demise of De Lancie does not signal a death knell for the
protections afforded under federal law," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Alameda County Deputy Dist. Atty. A. Mark Hutchins said most
California jails and prisons now have signs warning that outgoing
calls may be monitored, making it possible to tape conversations
without violating the federal law.</TE>
<TE>   Loyd even confirmed that she was aware that her calls might be
taped when she mentioned that possibility to a woman she called from
jail, Hutchins said.</TE>
<TE>   Hutchins, who represented a statewide association of prosecutors
in the case, said the ruling will make the state's prisons and jails
safer.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes it more difficult for gang members to communicate to the
outside and will cut down on smuggling attempts," Hutchins said.
"Gang members who are up to things like intimidating or killing
witnesses or communicating gang instructions in and out--those are
the people who will be hurt by this. And I say fine."</TE>
<TE>   Justice Kathryn Mickle Werdegar, in a separate opinion, agreed
with the result reached in the Loyd case but offered another legal
analysis.</TE>
<TE>   She said she believes that Loyd should have lost not because state
law on inmate rights has changed since the 1982 ruling but because
the court decision was incorrect at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "No objectively reasonable expectation of conversational privacy
can be maintained in prison or jail because of the pervasive and
constant monitoring to which incarcerated persons are subject,"
Werdegar wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Kennard, in another separate opinion, said Alameda County
prosecutors took a "considerable risk in instituting a surveillance
practice that this court had condemned in De Lancie."</TE>
<TE>   But Kennard said she agreed that the prosecution should not be
sanctioned because the Legislature changed the law before Loyd was
taped.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Atty. Gen. William Kuimelis, who argued on behalf of the
prosecution in the case, praised Monday's ruling in People vs. Loyd,
S092653. "The impact is that prosecutors are going to be able to
collect the information they need to prosecute some of these cases,"
Kuimelis said.</TE>

<HD>Record Donation to UCLA</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN and CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Entertainment industry mogul David Geffen will donate $200 million to
UCLA's medical school, the largest single gift ever to a U.S. medical
school or to the University of California.</LD>
<LD>   The gift, to be announced today, is a huge coup for UCLA, not only
because of its size but also because it is unrestricted. Geffen is
giving the medical school a free hand in deciding how to use the
money, an unusual step for a major donor.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a university's dream kind of gift," UCLA Chancellor
Albert Carnesale said.</LD>
<TE>   "Mr. Geffen has not asked for a specific building, or a specific
program, or a specific professorship, or the development of a
specific clinical procedure, or for the treatment of a specific
disease. What he's done is to ensure that the people best able to
make those decisions in the future are in the position to make those
decisions."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Geffen, 59, co-founder of the entertainment company
DreamWorks SKG, will have his name emblazoned on the prestigious
50-year-old medical school, which will be known as the David Geffen
School of Medicine at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   The entertainment executive, who holds no university degree,
declined to be interviewed Monday.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement prepared for release today, however, Geffen said
the purpose of his donation is "to support one of the most innovative
medical schools in the world," and "to inspire others to do the
same."</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angeles is my home, and I want to do my part in contributing
to its future," said Geffen, whose net worth has been estimated at
$3.9 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "I have great respect and affection for UCLA, and my hope is that
with this gift, UCLA's doctors and researchers will be better
equipped to unravel medicine's mysteries--and deliver the cures for
tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Andy Spahn, a spokesman for Geffen and president of his personal
foundation, said the gift--though vastly larger than any previous
Geffen donation--will continue his pattern of donations to
medical-related causes. These include gifts of $2.5 million to AIDS
Project Los Angeles, $2.5 million to the Gay Men's Health Crisis in
New York and $1.4 million to AIDS Action in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The $200 million is not Geffen's first gift to UCLA. . He is the
name benefactor of the Geffen Playhouse at UCLA, which is across the
street from UCLA's medical school and medical center.</TE>
<TE>   Geffen has other ties to the University of California as well: He
was appointed to the UC Board of Regents in 1980 by then-Gov. Jerry
Brown and served for seven years.</TE>
<TE>   Geffen's new gift will dramatically expand the UCLA medical
school's endowment, which amounted to $587 million as of last June.</TE>
<TE>   But the vast majority of the other funds are targeted for specific
projects, which is one of the main reasons that UCLA, like other
medical schools, struggles during economic downturns.</TE>
<TE>   The money drawn annually from the Geffen donation will go to
general purposes including student financial aid and training medical
scientists.</TE>
<TE>   It also will help expand research into such areas as genetics and
vaccines, said Gerald S. Levey, dean of the UCLA medical school and
UCLA's provost for medical sciences.</TE>
<TE>   Unrestricted funds, he said, "are one of the things that made
Harvard, for example, the great school that it is. One of my goals
has always been to have an unrestricted endowment, and now we have
it."</TE>
<TE>   Geffen's gift pushes forward what has been an already successful
multiyear fund-raising drive by UCLA. That campaign, launched in May
1997, initially was intended to raise $1.2 billion by the end of this
year, but pledges already have surpassed $1.7 billion, and UCLA's
latest goal is to garner commitments for $2.4 billion by the end of
2005.</TE>
<TE>   The Geffen donation eclipses the $150-million pledge to UCLA for
its new medical center and research facilities, which was facilitated
two years ago by Michael Ovitz on behalf of friends of former
President Reagan. Ovitz himself donated $25 million.</TE>
<TE>   In an era where major donations often involve long courtships and
complicated negotiations, UCLA officials said their dealings with
Geffen were remarkable for their simplicity.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA approached Geffen two or three years ago about donating to
the medical school, but the idea was put on a back burner. Then, in
April, Geffen contacted UCLA and met with Levey to express his
interest.</TE>
<TE>   "There were not very many discussions," Carnesale said. "This was
basically a decision that Mr. Geffen made, and then it was a matter
of filling in the details. It was almost just a matter of him
informing us of his interest in supporting the medical school, and
our responding with great enthusiasm."</TE>
<TE>   In Hollywood, Geffen is a major power broker, widely respected and
feared for his quick temper, keen eye for talent and love-hate
business relationships. His career began at age 20 as a mail room
worker at the William Morris Agency in Manhattan. He later
acknowledged he had faked a UCLA degree in theater arts on his resume
to land the job.</TE>
<TE>   From there, he earned a fortune and fearsome reputation in the
record and movie industries. During the 1980s he ran Geffen Records,
which assembled a talent roster including John Lennon and Yoko Ono,
Elton John, Donna Summer, Guns N' Roses, Aerosmith, Don Henley, Cher
and Peter Gabriel.</TE>
<TE>   Geffen's movie label, Geffen Pictures, produced a string of
features including "Personal Best," "Beetlejuice," "Interview with
the Vampire," "Risky Business" and "Little Shop of Horrors." He also
had a Broadway theater company responsible for many Broadway
musicals, including "Cats," "Dreamgirls," "Little Shop of Horrors,"
"Miss Saigon" and the play "M. Butterfly."</TE>
<TE>   These days, he helps run DreamWorks SKG, which he formed in 1994
with fellow Hollywood powerhouses Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven
Spielberg.</TE>
<TE>   According to the 2000 biography "The Operator," by journalist Tom
King, his feuds with other entertainment executives, including former
Disney executive Ovitz, are legendary. Equally notable are his
long-standing friendships and loyal partnerships, as well as his
philanthropy.</TE>
<TE>   Before he created DreamWorks, Geffen devoted 100% of the profit
from his movies and Broadway shows to charitable purposes. Since
then, he has given more than $50million to charity.</TE>
<TE>   But Geffen's largest individual charitable gifts until now
amounted to two $5-million donations to the arts. One went to the
498-seat theater now known as the Geffen Playhouse. The other went to
the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles' warehouse-like
facility in Little Tokyo, now called the Geffen Contemporary.</TE>
<TE>   The new Geffen donation nearly doubles the largest previous cash
donations earmarked for a university medical school. The previous
record was the $110-million gift to USC's medical school by the W.M.
Keck Foundation in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Geffen donation barely cracks the top dozen among all
categories of gifts to American colleges or universities. The
nation's leader on that score is Caltech, which last year received a
combined $600 million from Intel co-founder Gordon Moore and his
wife, Betty Moore, along with their Gordon and Betty Moore
Foundation. That same year, the Hewlett foundation gave $400 million
to Stanford University.</TE>
<TE>   According to UCLA officials, the largest gift given to the
University of California previously was a donation of $101.3 million
to UC San Francisco by the Catellus Development Corp. in 1999.</TE>

<HD>Pa. Death Row Inmate Acquitted at Retrial, Freed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Pennsylvania man, convicted of brutally murdering a woman and three
children, has been freed from death row after being acquitted at a
retrial.</LD>
<LD>   A jury in New Castle, Pa., found Thomas H. Kimbell Jr. not guilty
Friday after a trial that lasted nearly two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Kimbell became the 101st person to be released since 1973 from
death row after exoneration, according to the Death Penalty
Information Center in Washington, D.C.</LD>
<TE>   Kimbell, 40, a onetime crack addict, was convicted in 1998 of
viciously stabbing to death a woman and three small children in a
mobile home four years earlier in what prosecutors had portrayed as a
drug deal gone bad.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court overturned the
conviction and said Kimbell was entitled to a new trial because the
judge had refused to permit jurors to hear evidence that raised
doubts about his guilt.</TE>
<TE>   Although Kimbell, who lived near the murder victims, became a
suspect early on, he was not arrested until more than two years after
the killings.</TE>
<TE>   There were no eyewitnesses or physical evidence linking Kimbell to
the crime.</TE>
<TE>   The issue that led to the retrial involved the testimony of
Marilyn Herko, who was the sister-in-law of murder victim Bonnie
Dryfuse. In addition to Dryfuse, her daughters Jacqueline, 7, and
Heather, 4, and Herko's daughter, Stephanie, 5, were stabbed many
times and their throats were slashed on the afternoon of June 15,
1994.</TE>
<TE>   At Kimbell's first trial, Herko was called as a defense witness
and testified that she was on the phone with her sister-in-law
shortly before the murders. She said that Dryfuse ended the call,
saying, "I got to go, somebody just pulled up in the driveway."</TE>
<TE>   Then, defense lawyer Thomas W. Leslie attempted to ask Herko about
a statement she had earlier given to state police, saying that
Dryfuse told her she had to end the call because her husband, Tom
Dryfuse, was pulling into the driveway. The prosecutor contended that
Leslie could not impeach his own witness and thereby suggest that Tom
Dryfuse had been at the crime scene 40 minutes earlier than the time
he told police he had arrived and found the bodies. The judge agreed
with the prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   The state Supreme Court said there was "a significant difference"
between the two versions. "Defense counsel's inability to
cross-examine Herko regarding the statement" deprived him of the
opportunity to establish that the husband "was at the scene of the
murders during the time he claimed to be elsewhere.... This obviously
worked to the benefit of the prosecution," the court held.
Authorities dropped Tom Dryfuse as a suspect before the first trial.</TE>
<TE>   Kimbell had maintained his innocence despite testimony from
witnesses that he had been near the scene of the crime shortly before
the murders and despite the testimony of several individuals,
including three jailhouse informants, that he had admitted committing
the murders.</TE>
<TE>   At the retrial, jurors heard both versions of Herko's story. In
addition, one of the jailhouse informants had died and a second
recanted his earlier testimony, saying he had been pressured into
giving it.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyer Leslie said he was very pleased with the outcome
because "I felt all along that the prosecution did not have a good
case to begin with. I think it's always questionable to use jailhouse
informants because they are usually looking for something, and that
creates an incentive for the inmate to make up a better story."</TE>
<TE>   Anthony J. Krastek, Pennsylvania's senior assistant attorney
general, said he was very disappointed in the outcome and still
believes that Kimbell was the murderer. Krastek, who was the lead
prosecutor at both trials, said that Kimbell had told people details
of the crime that only the murderer could have known.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence County Dist. Atty. Matthew Mangino said his office would
reopen its investigation of the case.</TE>
<TE>   "There may not be anything more that we can do ... but it is
certainly our responsibility to take a close look and not just put it
on the shelf and say that's the end of it," Mangino said.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>A man carried two loaded handguns through a security checkpoint at
Louis Armstrong International Airport on Monday but was arrested
after a random check before he boarded a flight to Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   FBI special agent Julian Gonzales said the semiautomatic handguns
were found in the man's backpack at a Continental Airlines gate.</LD>
<LD>   The man, Carlos Stephens, 30, said he worked for No Limit Records
and told investigators he needed the guns in his work, according to
acting U.S. Atty. Jim Letten.</LD>
<TE>   Roy Maughan Jr., a lawyer for No Limit, said Stephens is not
employed by the company but is an independent producer who has worked
with the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Stephens was charged with attempting to carry weapons aboard an
aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Stephens carried the guns through an X-ray security checkpoint run
by St. Louis-based Huntleigh USA Corp., airport officials said. A
call to Huntleigh was not immediately returned.</TE>
<TE>   "I consider this a massive failure. Whoever is responsible is
messing up terribly," Letten said.</TE>

<HD>Pipe Bombings of Mailboxes Spread</HD>
<DH>Crime: Two devices are found in Nebraska and Colorado.
Warning goes out that more such incidents are likely.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>The string of mailbox pipe bombings that has rattled nerves across
the Great Plains continued west Monday, when a bomb was found in
Colorado, as well as another in Nebraska. Both bombs appeared similar
to 15 others found since Friday in Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities are confident the same person or group of people has
planted all the devices, six of which exploded, injuring four postal
workers and two residents.</LD>
<LD>   Law enforcement officials reiterated their calls Monday for
caution, telling U.S. Postal Service employees and rural residents on
a rough east-west line through the nation's midsection to assume the
worst--that more bombs were out there.</LD>
<TE>   The 16th bomb was found Monday in the south-central Nebraska town
of Hastings, within a few dozen miles of some of the other devices.
The bomb, which did not explode, was discovered by a resident who had
been out of town for the weekend, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Mail delivery resumed in the areas of Illinois and Iowa where it
had been halted Saturday, although postal workers in the affected
areas refused to deliver mail unless residents removed or propped
open the doors to their standalone mailboxes.</TE>
<TE>   In Illinois and Iowa on Friday, six bombs exploded and two others
were discovered that did not detonate.</TE>
<TE>   More than 550 miles to the southwest, a resident of the small town
of Salida, Colo., discovered a bomb just after noon Monday. It also
did not explode.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities spent much of the day Monday trying to determine
whether the Salida bomb was the work of the bomber or bombers working
in the Midwest or that of a copycat. Well after nightfall, they
decided it matched the 16 others.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a rather disturbing pattern where the subjects are moving
west rather quickly," FBI agent Mark Mershon said. "We're looking for
someone who is mobile. We're moving mountains to determine who that
is."</TE>
<TE>   Late Monday night, meanwhile, authorities were investigating a
report that a pipe bomb had been discovered in Pueblo, Colo., but it
had not been definitively linked to the other cases. "We've got a
knucklehead on our hands," said Rich Marianos, agent in charge of the
Colorado Springs, Colo., office of the federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms. "It's either a copycat or the real guy. Either
way, I'd love to nail him."</TE>
<TE>   In Nebraska, officials said they may have discovered why none of
the eight bombs in their state detonated.</TE>
<TE>   What may have been missing in the Nebraska bombs, authorities
said, was a length of duct tape.</TE>
<TE>   All the bombs were constructed nearly identically, of a 6-inch by
3/4-inch piece of steel pipe filled with combustible material and
ignited with the charge from a 9-volt battery. The Nebraska bombs,
however, lacked a piece of duct tape that in the other cases had
secured a triggering mechanism.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe that's why they didn't go off," said Peter Sakaris, an FBI
special agent based in Omaha. "Or maybe they were designed not to go
off, with the bomber thinking we already got his message and he
didn't need to blow any more up. But we certainly can't be sure of
that.</TE>
<TE>   "Other than the duct tape, they were identical" and fully capable
of detonating, he said.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear late Monday whether there was duct tape on the
triggering device on the bomb found in Salida.</TE>
<TE>   All of the devices came with a plastic zip-top bag and a folded
piece of paper on which was typed an antigovernment screed that
federal profilers say appears to have been written by an older male
who is perhaps obsessed with death.</TE>
<TE>   "You allow yourself to fear death!" the note reads at one point.
"World authorities allowed, and still allow you to fear death! In
avoiding death you are forced to conform."</TE>
<TE>   The note also promises more "attention getters."</TE>
<TE>   Before Sept. 11, a string of mailbox pipe bombings would hardly
have made even the local news, Sakaris said. But the Postal Service
was already on edge after anthrax-laced letters passed through its
system last fall, killing five people on the East Coast.</TE>
<TE>   With the threatening note and the FBI calling the bombings
"domestic terrorism," investigators--and the media--have swarmed to
the sites of the incidents.</TE>
<TE>   About 150 postal inspection agents, 70 FBI agents, more than a
dozen members of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and
several dozen more state and local officers were on the case by late
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the FBI's field office in Omaha were doing the
morning television shows, the evening television shows and, in
between, were answering calls from news outlets ranging from the
British Broadcasting Corp. in London to Voice of America.</TE>
<TE>   If the job of the spokespeople was hectic, at least it felt safe.</TE>
<TE>   In Tipton, Iowa, where a bomb exploded Friday, mail carrier Jim
Pelzer wore safety goggles and earplugs on his route. His wife had
given him the protective gear.</TE>
<TE>   "My feeling was when we had 9/11 and the anthrax scare, I was a
little concerned about my job safety," Pelzer said. "But now I'm
intimidated and scared."</TE>
<TE>   Times reporter Julie Cart in Denver contributed to this report.</TE>

<LD>WASHINGTON, D.C.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. regulators approved a device that provides a new treatment
option for women who have had a cancerous breast lump removed.</LD>
<LD>   The MammoSite Radiation Therapy System is designed to send
radiation directly to the site where the lump was taken out, with
minimal radiation to surrounding tissue, the Food and Drug
Administration said.</LD>
<TE>   The device, a hollow catheter with an inflatable balloon attached,
is made by Proxima Therapeutics Inc. of Alpharetta, Ga. Doctors must
implant the device into the breast at the lumpectomy site to deliver
doses of radiation. Treatment lasts one to five days, the company
said. The implant is removed after radiation therapy is completed.</TE>

<LD>   Since Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani left office Dec. 31, at least a
dozen police detectives have been protecting him, his family and his
girlfriend at a projected cost of nearly $1 million a year, a police
official said. The police detail is larger than Mayor Michael R.
Bloomberg's, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</LD>
<LD>   The protection extends to Giuliani's two teenage children, his
estranged wife and his mother.</LD>
<TE>   It is common for mayors to have police protection after they leave

<HD>Bush Defends His Call for Standardized School Tests</HD>
<DH>Education: Speaking to pupils in Michigan, he repeats his
pledge to demand accountability.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SOUTHFIELD, Mich.</DL>
<LD>President Bush returned Monday to one of his favorite, and most
politically potent, topics: the improvements that he said can come to
a public school when authorities are held accountable for academic
performance.</LD>
<LD>   Greater accountability through new annual reading and math tests
in the third through eighth grades is a key element of the education
reform law Bush steered through Congress.</LD>
<LD>   Visiting an extended-year elementary school near Detroit at which
reading and math test scores have improved significantly during the
last decade, Bush sought to respond to critics of such standardized
exams. "We must be wise enough to measure.... We must incorporate
accountability and then be quick enough to change when we find
failure. And mark my words what's going to happen: We're going to
start seeing great progress," he told several hundred people in the
gymnasium at Vandenberg Elementary School.</LD>
<TE>   The speech, at a school where about 60% of the student population
of 410 is Arabic-speaking, was one of the rare occasions in which
Bush did not devote a significant portion of his remarks to the war
on terrorism or the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Although much of his week will be spent on the Middle East--he
meets at the White House today with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon and Wednesday with Jordan King Abdullah II--he also plans to
focus on domestic issues in trips to Wisconsin, Ohio and Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan and these other Midwest states often are swing states in
presidential elections. And as part of building support for his
reelection, as well as helping Republican prospects in this year's
midterm elections, Bush periodically touts his commitment to and
record on education. His attention to the issue provides him the
chance to show his interests go beyond distant crises to include
subjects closer to home.</TE>
<TE>   "I will spend as much time as necessary to herald success in our
public schools," he said Monday. "We've got to get public schools
right."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's push for education reform was a central theme of his 2000
presidential campaign, and the bill he signed into law in January
included several of his proposals.</TE>
<TE>   The measure, which gained bipartisan backing, gives state and
local school districts more freedom in how they spend federal
dollars. But in return they must toughen teacher standards, offer new
options to parents whose children attend poorly performing schools
and impose the annual reading and math tests, beginning in the
2005-06 school year.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said that Vandenberg Elementary demonstrates the usefulness
of testing. "This school is a living example of great progress. Kind
of at the bottom of the measurement standards, if I'm not mistaken,
five years ago, and now you're soaring off the chart."</TE>
<TE>   Even as reliance on standardized testing appears to be spreading,
some critics complain that many exams are insufficient measures of
academic achievement. The critics also complain that the emphasis
placed on the tests forces teachers to spend too much time preparing
students, at the cost of exploring other subjects and curricula.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to the critics, Bush said, "If you don't want to
measure, it kind of makes me worry that maybe ... you're not
confident about either your teacher quality or your curriculum."</TE>
<TE>   The testing issue is a particularly hot topic in April and May,
when students in many school districts are taking standardized exams.</TE>
<TE>   Bush noted that, in the current fiscal year, federal education
spending includes a 25% increase in aid for secondary and elementary
schools and a 35% increase for teacher recruitment. Such spending
justifies the accountability demands, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you spend something, you ought to get results for it," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Several Democrats who supported the education reform bill have
accused Bush of short-changing schools in his proposed budget for the
2003 fiscal year. And they were quick to take exception to his
comments Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), chairman of the Senate education
committee, said Bush has "put forward the worst education budget in a
decade."</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy said the 2.8% increase Bush proposed for education was the
smallest in seven years. He said overall increases in federal
education spending had averaged 13% annually the last seven years.</TE>

<HD>GOP's Small Talk of '94 Fading</HD>
<DH>Politics: Pressure is off to shrink government, and Sept.
11 attacks are only part of the reason. Term limits, other tenets of
'contract' are passe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Bit by bit, Congress is undercutting the legacy of the Republican
"revolution," the Newt Gingrich-led movement whose aims included
ending federal aid to poor immigrants, government subsidies for
farmers and the federal budget deficit.</LD>
<LD>   Gingrich and his feisty band of conservatives realized much of
their agenda. But now many of the achievements are being dismantled,
even as a conservative Republican reigns in the White House.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush soon will sign a bill restoring food stamp benefits
for hundreds of thousands of legal immigrants who were cut off from
the aid six years ago. The Senate this week will join the House in
voting to vastly increase farm subsidies, including payments to
mohair and honey producers that had been cut off by 1996 legislation.
The federal budget that Congress had balanced now is awash in red
ink.</LD>
<TE>   GOP Revolution</TE>
<TE>   Losing Its Edge</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, some of the revolution's pillars are standing tall.
The House is expected to renew soon the landmark 1996 welfare reform
law, and the Bush administration has delivered on the mid-1990s
crusade for big tax cuts.</TE>
<TE>   But many other issues that defined the revolution have lost their
edge: Term limits? Career politicians increasingly ignore them.
Medicare? Republicans who once sought economies now want to expand
the popular program.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts argue that the policy changes reflect, in part, the
shift in thinking that has been led by Bush and his governing
philosophy of compassionate conservatism. Furthermore, his
business-oriented pragmatism has produced a less ideological
approach.</TE>
<TE>   "The 1994 Republican revolution was predicated on eliminating
agencies and scaling back government, but conservatism now is headed
in an entirely different direction," said Marshall Wittmann, a
political analyst at the conservative Hudson Institute think tank in
Washington. "We are seeing the beginnings of big-government
conservatism."</TE>
<TE>   When Republicans won control of the House and Senate in 1994, they
pursued an agenda that celebrated small government, limited terms for
politicians, a strong national defense, free enterprise and a
balanced budget.</TE>
<TE>   Part of that agenda fell by the wayside. Proposals to abolish the
Education Department and other Cabinet agencies did not advance
beyond the rhetorical stage. A constitutional amendment to require
term limits languished. Congress passed a law giving the president a
line-item veto of budget items, but it was overturned by the Supreme
Court.</TE>
<TE>   Other major elements of the GOP agenda, however, seemed to take
root. The 1996 Freedom to Farm Act was hailed as a seminal change in
policy that would wean farmers off New Deal-era government subsidies
and introduce a more market-oriented approach to agriculture. The
welfare reform law brought a new focus on getting the poor off the
dole and into jobs. And when Congress passed a five-year plan in 1997
for balancing the budget--including new limits on the growth of
Medicare spending--lawmakers were confident they had set the
government on a new fiscal course.</TE>
<TE>   The most durable of these achievements is likely to be the welfare
law. In renewing the bill this year, Congress may impose work
requirements that are, if anything, more stringent than those in the
1996 act. Democrats, however, are expected to force a debate on
whether the law went too far in cutting off welfare benefits to
illegal immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   In pursuing that issue, Democrats are encouraged by success on
another front: the pending enactment of the provision to restore
federal food stamp benefits to legal immigrants. House Republicans
initially resisted that retreat. But Bush supported restoration of
the benefits, in keeping with his efforts to bolster the GOP's
political appeal to Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Mann, an expert on Congress at the Brookings Institution, a
nonpartisan think tank in Washington, called the Republicans' shift
on food stamps "the triumph of tactical politics over ideology."</TE>
<TE>   The reversal on farm policy was also driven, in part, by practical
politics. Republicans were under pressure to abandon their
free-market experiment because so many crucial House and Senate
election fights this year are being waged in the Farm Belt.
Free-market advocates see it as a regrettable signal that erstwhile
GOP revolutionaries have lost the courage of their convictions.</TE>
<TE>   "The Republicans in power seem to be settling into a comfortable
existence" in which they are less willing to challenge the status
quo, said Chris Edwards, a budget analyst at the libertarian Cato
Institute, a Washington think tank.</TE>
<TE>   Far different forces have been at work in unraveling the balanced
budget agreement, but its collapse is just as striking. Republicans
who strongly supported the accord now are embracing policies that
will produce a deficit for years to come: increased spending for
defense and homeland security, along with continued implementation of
Bush's 10-year, $1.3-trillion tax cut.</TE>
<TE>   'It's an Open</TE>
<TE>   Buffet Table'</TE>
<TE>   The attacks of Sept. 11 bear much of the responsibility: Lawmakers
have concluded that defense needs are more important than balancing
the budget. Still, many spending increases that have been approved or
are being pushed have only a tenuous relationship to anti-terrorism
efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an open buffet table, and no one is checking tickets," said
Mike Franc, a former aide to House Majority Leader Dick Armey
(R-Texas), who now is an analyst at the conservative Heritage
Foundation think tank.</TE>
<TE>   And even before Sept. 11, Congress was steadily increasing
spending for domestic programs. Lawmakers had lifted some of the
spending curbs imposed on Medicare in 1997. Now their focus is on
providing a new prescription-drug benefit for the elderly rather than
on slowing the growth of health-care spending.</TE>
<TE>   The issue of term limits was an article of faith for many of the
Republicans first elected in 1994. One of the first acts by the new
House Republican leadership was to impose limits on the terms of
committee chairmen--a reform that has remained in place. But it had
less effect than proponents might have expected: Some lawmakers
forced from one chairmanship simply took the helm of another panel.
And many lawmakers who came to Congress pledging to serve a limited
term, such as Rep. George R. Nethercutt Jr. (R-Wash.) and Sen. Paul
Wellstone (D-Minn.), have broken that promise.</TE>
<TE>   Policy shifts in other areas have been driven largely by Bush.
While Gingrich &amp; Co. came to power calling for a smaller federal role
in education, Bush pushed his party to support a reform bill that
vastly increases the role of the federal government in the public
schools.</TE>
<TE>   Mental Illness Coverage</TE>
<TE>   May Be Mandated</TE>
<TE>   If Congress follows Bush's lead on other fronts, it will embrace
some items that would have been anathema to the GOP a few years ago.
These include requiring health insurers to improve coverage of mental
illness and expanding AmeriCorps, a program to promote voluntarism
that was a favorite of President Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   For some veterans of the GOP revolution, this is a time for
introspection. "I'm not going to sit here ... and suggest everything
we did was perfect," said Dan Meyer, a former chief of staff to
Gingrich. "There's always going to be tinkering and improvement."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Zack Wamp (R-Tenn.), who was first elected to the House in
1994, said the changing legislative landscape reflects a natural
evolution toward the political center of a conservative movement that
had to push hard against an entrenched and stubborn bloc of liberal
Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not an indictment of the past; it's more a dose of reality,"
Wamp said. "We have to be sensitive to changing times."</TE>

<HD>Flooding Closes Some W. Virginia Schools</HD>
<DH>Disaster: Muck covers classroom floors, and the foundation
of one building is destroyed. Eight are known dead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHARLESTON, W.Va.</DL>
<LD>Some southern West Virginia schools won't be able to reopen this year
because of damage from last week's deadly floods, officials said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Floods and mudslides caused by torrential rainfall were blamed for
at least six deaths in West Virginia and two in Virginia. Six people
were still missing Monday in West Virginia, and one man was
unaccounted for in Kentucky.</LD>
<LD>   Damages continued to mount Monday as residents braced for more
rain this week. The National Weather Service said flooding was
possible today through Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   Preliminary damage estimates released by state emergency officials
said about 2,400 homes and businesses in West Virginia's McDowell,
Wyoming, Mercer and Mingo counties were harmed by the flooding.</TE>
<TE>   Near the hard-hit southern West Virginia city of Welch, emergency
officials briefly evacuated about 25 residences in a mobile home park
Monday because state inspectors believed a reservoir in an industrial
park was in danger of failing. Residents were allowed to return
before noon, McDowell County officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to more than 500 homes and businesses damaged or
destroyed in the area, one elementary school in Supt. Mark Manchin
said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's conceivable we may not get some of these students back this
year," Manchin said by telephone from Iaeger High School, where 4
feet of water rushed into the school Thursday and left 4 inches of
mud and muck in classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   "You would not believe the devastation," Manchin said. "It defies
belief. I have never seen anything like it in my life."</TE>
<TE>   McDowell County schools had been scheduled to close June 4.</TE>
<TE>   Five feet of water rushed through the main hall of Panther
Elementary, which has about 160 students, and apparently moved the
building off its foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a total loss and cannot be salvaged," Manchin said.</TE>
<TE>   Flooding also struck the county last July, killing six people.</TE>

<HD>Judge Blasts State's 'Despicable' Handling of Missing Girl</HD>
<DH>Crime: The Florida agency reported her in good care months
after she was taken. Lawyers dispute responsibility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>A judge lashed out Monday at the state Department of Children &amp;
Families, calling their handling of the case of a missing 5-year-old
girl "absolutely despicable."</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, lawyers argued over who was taking care of Rilya Wilson
when she disappeared 16 months ago, adding another layer of confusion
to the case.</LD>
<LD>   In court Monday, Judge Cindy Lederman said that nearly two months
after Rilya was last seen in January 2001, caseworker Deborah
Muskelly told her the child was in day care.</LD>
<TE>   The juvenile judge also said that in a report submitted Aug. 31,
2001, Muskelly said Rilya's custodian was addressing her needs.</TE>
<TE>   "Aside from everything else, she misrepresented the child's
well-being to this court," Lederman said during the status hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives are now treating Rilya's disappearance, which went
unnoticed for more than a year, as a possible homicide. Investigators
are waiting for DNA test results from police in Kansas City, Mo., to
see if a girl found beheaded there in April 2001 was Rilya.</TE>
<TE>   The actions of Muskelly, who resigned in March over her
performance in other cases, are among of the targets of an
investigation into Rilya's whereabouts.</TE>
<TE>   "It is absolutely despicable what happened in this case," Lederman
said.</TE>
<TE>   Children &amp; Families Secretary Kathleen Kearney said, "This
particular case, unbelievably tragic, is an isolated event."</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Jeb Bush has named a four-member panel to examine the state's
child protection system in Miami-Dade County.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's hearing raised new questions about who was caring for the
child before her disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Wells, the department's top lawyer, said Pamela Graham had
been given legal custody of the girl. She is the sister of Geralyn
Graham, who has identified herself as the girl's paternal
grandmother. The state concedes that the identity of Rilya's father
is in dispute. The girl's mother, Gloria Wilson, has refused to
disclose his identity.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Shohat, a lawyer for the Grahams, said the sisters jointly
cared for Rilya. Geralyn Graham failed to bring her driver's license
on the day she was to sign the custody papers, Shohat said. Pamela
Graham provided her license instead, and the papers were signed
giving her legal custody.</TE>
<TE>   The judge said Rilya was ultimately the court's responsibility and
hinted that Muskelly could face charges of perjury and making false
statements.</TE>
<TE>   The agency said that it will now require supervisors as well as
caseworkers to visit every child's home, and caregivers and children
old enough to write will be required to sign a log after visits.</TE>

<HD>Ethanol Price-Fix Probed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>U.S. trade regulators said Monday that they have turned over a
price-fixing investigation of Archer Daniels Midland and other
producers of the gasoline additive ethanol to the Department of
Justice, in a sign the probe could turn into a criminal case.</LD>
<LD>   "After reviewing these materials, staff of the FTC's Bureau of
Competition has transmitted them to the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice," Federal Trade Commission General Counsel
William Kovacic wrote to Rep. Doug Ose (R-Sacramento), head of the
House subcommittee on energy policy, natural resources and regulatory
affairs.</LD>
<LD>   Late last month, Ose revealed internal memos by ADM and other
ethanol producers indicating collusion to set prices for alcohol
originating from surplus European wine to mix with the additive.</LD>
<TE>   During the April 23 hearing, Ose asked the FTC to investigate the
allegations. After a review, the agency turned the probe over to the
Department of Justice, a move Ose said implied illegal activity.</TE>
<TE>   ADM, which produces 41% of the ethanol in the U.S., has long
touted the benefits of ethanol as a boon to U.S. farmers and energy
security because most of it is made from U.S.-grown corn.</TE>
<TE>   However, the documents under review suggest that the company has
been rigging bids to buy wine alcohol before turning it into ethanol.</TE>
<TE>   In doing so, the company appears to have benefited from subsidies
in Europe and the U.S., Ose said.</TE>
<TE>   "It has to do with purchases of wine alcohol in the European Union
eight or 10 years ago," said ADM representative Larry Cunningham. "We
are doing fact-finding at ADM to determine what the facts are."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Authorities Question FBI Spy's Candor</HD>
<DH>Espionage: Some believe Hanssen has lied about the secrets
he gave Russia. But prosecutors intend to honor their plea agreement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal prosecutors charged Monday that convicted FBI spy Robert
Phillip Hanssen has "blood ... on his hands" and may have lied to
government interrogators about his two-decade career as a Russian
spy, but they grudgingly agreed to honor their plea deal with him
anyway.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities are "troubled and concerned" about assessments that
Hanssen has feigned memory loss concerning his finances and his
motives as a spy, officials said in a court filing. But they said
that there is a legitimate split among interrogators about his candor
and that there is not enough evidence to justify scrapping the deal
they struck with Hanssen last year that spared him a possible death
sentence in exchange for his guilty plea.</LD>
<LD>   That conclusion clears the way for Hanssen, one of the most
damaging spies in U.S. history, to be sentenced to life in prison
Friday in federal court.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't expect [the judge] will do anything other than give him
a life sentence. That's what we're expecting," said defense attorney
Plato Cacheris.</TE>
<TE>   "He gave something like 75 days of interviews over 200 hours, so
we think he has fully complied with the terms of his plea agreement,"
Cacheris said in an interview. "The fact that some people don't think
he's been fully candid, we don't agree with that."</TE>
<TE>   The previously undisclosed questions about Hanssen's candor
threaten to prolong efforts by U.S. intelligence agents to determine
how much damage he did to national security and what exactly he gave
the Russians.</TE>
<TE>   Hanssen's testimony is a vital part of that process, and questions
about his truthfulness "complicate it in the sense that it will
require more time to resolve issues where there are questions and
inconsistencies," according to a U.S. official involved in the
process.</TE>
<TE>   Another U.S. official who asked not to be identified said
officials conducting the damage assessment on behalf of the CIA are
seeking to corroborate Hanssen's testimony. The issue of Hanssen's
candor "colors how you view it, but you would never take what he says
at face value anyway," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone involved in the case agrees that the former FBI
supervisor did massive damage to U.S. national security by giving the
Russians information on U.S. nuclear capabilities,
intelligence-gathering systems, the identities of double-agents and
other secrets.</TE>
<TE>   In unusually biting and personal language for a government court
filing, prosecutors Monday branded Hanssen "a traitor" whose "brazen
and reckless conduct ... is almost beyond comprehension."</TE>
<TE>   "By his treachery, he made this a more dangerous and volatile
world in which to raise our families," prosecutors said in a
sentencing memorandum filed by the U.S. attorney's office in U.S.
District Court in Alexandria, Va., before Friday's hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "For his betrayal of our country, and for the unpardonable
consequences of his misconduct, Hanssen deserves to forfeit his right
ever to live again within our community and within our society," the
filing said. Noting two KGB double-agents who were executed by the
Russians after Hanssen helped reveal their identities, prosecutors
said: "Their blood is on his hands."</TE>
<TE>   The plea deal that Hanssen struck with prosecutors in July
required that he "cooperate fully, truthfully and completely with the
United States." It offered U.S. authorities the chance to find out
what state secrets Hanssen had given the Soviets beginning in
1979--without having to go through a trial that risked public
disclosure of national security data. It also allowed him to avoid
the death penalty while ensuring that his wife would retain an FBI
pension worth nearly $40,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Since the deal was struck, Hanssen has met almost weekly with
government debriefers.</TE>
<TE>   One session several months ago became heated, according to sources
close to the case, when interrogators grilled Hanssen about the
questionable results of a polygraph he had taken and Hanssen appeared
to lunge at one of his interrogators.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, two groups involved in the interrogation--the FBI and
the Webster Commission, which issued a report last month that was
critical of FBI security flaws--gave generally positive assessments
of Hanssen's cooperation, according to Monday's court filing.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI concluded that Hanssen was "in substantial compliance with
the terms of his plea agreement," the filing said. According to the
FBI, he "provided information during the debriefings that was
identical or consistent with independent investigative results, and
in some cases was previously unknown to us and damaging to himself."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, sources have previously told The Times that Hanssen
revealed to his debriefers that he had given up to the Russians the
identity of one of Washington's most valuable double agents--a
disclosure that U.S. authorities had not known about. The double
agent, a top Soviet intelligence official named Dimitri "Top Hat"
Polyakov, was later killed by the Soviets.</TE>
<TE>   But two other agencies involved in the Hanssen debriefings--a
CIA-led damage assessment team and the Justice Department inspector
general's office--had "serious reservations" about Hanssen's candor,
the court filing said.</TE>
<TE>   The damage assessment team "questioned Hanssen's claims of a poor
memory as an excuse for either not engaging fully in the debriefing
or as a means to hide facets of his activity," the filing said.</TE>
<TE>   And the inspector general "found that Hanssen's answers were often
contradictory, inconsistent, or illogical, and found Hanssen's
cooperation concerning his finances, the significance of his
espionage and his motives to be 'particularly problematic,'"
prosecutors said in the filing.</TE>
<TE>   Hanssen told Webster Commission members that money drove him to
become a spy, according to the group's report last month, but
questions have persisted about how much money he actually received
and what he did with it.</TE>
<TE>   The government charges that the Russians paid Hanssen $1.4 million
in cash and diamonds, but some of that was in a foreign bank account
that Hanssen may never have collected. He also spent large amounts of
cash on a Washington stripper whom he had befriended and tried to
turn to Christianity.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said evidence of "a complete failure to cooperate"
would be needed to try to void a plea agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not believe we have that here," prosecutors said. Given the
disagreements about Hanssen's candor, "the government cannot carry
its burden of proving a breach of the plea agreement."</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, who appeared eager to seek the death
penalty against Hanssen early in the case, signed off on the decision
to favor a life sentence, a Justice Department official said.</TE>

<HD>Victim Remembered in N.C. Jail Fire That Killed 8</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BAKERSVILLE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Jason Boston's friends and family gathered Monday to remember a
hard-working father taken away too soon, not far from the charred
jail where he and seven other inmates died.</LD>
<LD>   Boston, 27, was serving a three-day sentence for driving while
intoxicated when fire broke out Friday at the Mitchell County Jail.</LD>
<LD>   There were 17 inmates in the jail when it started, but jailers
couldn't open all the cells fast enough and eight victims were left
locked inside. Investigators are still searching for the fire's
cause.</LD>
<TE>   "These are tough times for all of us," the Rev. Chris Rathbone
told mourners at Boston's funeral. "It's tough for the family, for
the local government and for law enforcement officers."</TE>
<TE>   Some offices in the courthouse had reopened Monday, but the
building was closed later in the day when employees complained that
the fumes from the damaged area made them sick, Sheriff Ken Fox said.</TE>

<HD>Cardinal Ordered to Testify</HD>
<DH>Church: Voicing fears that Boston's Law will be called to
Rome, a judge seeks to depose him on sexual abuse cases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Expressing concern that the nation's senior Roman Catholic prelate
might be quickly summoned to Rome, a judge on Monday ordered Cardinal
Bernard Law to be deposed in the civil trial of defrocked priest John
J. Geoghan, accused of sexually abusing scores of children.</LD>
<LD>   Suffolk Superior Court Judge Constance Sweeney ordered the
cardinal to appear for the deposition at 9 a.m. Wednesday. The
session will be in a closed courtroom and is believed to be the first
time a cardinal has been deposed. It will be videotaped for court
records.</LD>
<LD>   Sweeney ruled that one of Geoghan's 86 alleged victims will be
permitted in the courtroom while the cardinal is questioned.</LD>
<TE>   The ruling comes on the heels of the decision late Friday by the
Boston archdiocese to back out of a $15-million to $30-million
settlement in the case. Church officials said the agreement would
cost too much.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Mitchell Garabedian, who represents the plaintiffs, said
he learned the archdiocese was reneging on the deal after church
officials held a news conference late Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "That is how sleazy they are," Garabedian said in his office
Monday. "At 4 o'clock they held a press conference. At quarter to 5
they told me."</TE>
<TE>   Garabedian and lawyers for the archdiocese negotiated for 111/2
months before the cardinal's council of financial advisors voted
Friday to reject the deal.</TE>
<TE>   In court Monday, Sweeney also was critical.</TE>
<TE>   "To say the rug was pulled out underneath the understanding of the
attorneys working on this case is an understatement," Sweeney said.</TE>
<TE>   The judge also expressed concern that Law might be called to Rome
by Pope John Paul II or be given a diplomatic post by the Vatican.</TE>
<TE>   Either situation could delay a deposition--or perhaps render it
impossible if Law were to be sequestered in the Vatican.</TE>
<TE>   "This court has significant concerns about whether the cardinal
will be available for deposition unless his deposition is taken
soon," Sweeney said.</TE>
<TE>   "His choice of whether his deposition is taken is not his alone,"
she continued. "It belongs to the pope in Rome. If the pope tells him
to go over there, he goes."</TE>
<TE>   However, Sweeney refused to impound Law's passport or to set a
steep bond for the cardinal.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson Rogers, the cardinal's lawyer, insisted in court that his
client will not dodge the deposition.</TE>
<TE>   "He is committed to participate in this process," Rogers said. "It
doesn't matter where he is."</TE>
<TE>   Law was scheduled to be deposed on four other occasions during the
lengthy negotiations in the Geoghan civil suits. Each time, the
procedure was postponed because both sides believed a settlement was
near.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal also is scheduled for deposition next month in the
case of Father Paul Shanley, another priest from the Boston
archdiocese accused of molesting children.</TE>
<TE>   Shanley on Monday was returned to Boston from San Diego, where he
has been living for several years. In addition to a series of civil
suits, Shanley faces three counts of child rape.</TE>
<TE>   The January trial and conviction of Geoghan, a priest in the
Boston archdiocese for more than 30 years, set off a sexual abuse
crisis that has rocked the Catholic church nationwide--and around the
world.</TE>
<TE>   Since this case was filed, Garabedian has been retained by more
than 50 others who claim Geoghan molested them. Geoghan is serving a
nine- to 10-year prison sentence for fondling a 10-year-old boy.</TE>
<TE>   Court documents published by the Boston Globe showed that church
officials moved Geoghan from parish to parish despite numerous sexual
abuse complaints against him.</TE>
<TE>   Law on Sunday explained that the proliferation of alleged victims
was forcing the archdiocese to rethink its settlement strategy.
Although he acknowledged that the change in plans might be difficult
for some abuse victims, he did not apologize for reneging on the
deal.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal has resisted calls for his resignation.</TE>

<HD>Lindh's Lawyers May Get Video Link to Cuba</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: A judge considers the move to allow interviews
of potential witnesses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.</DL>
<LD>A federal judge said Monday that he is considering a video hookup to
allow lawyers for American-born Taliban soldier John Walker Lindh to
interview detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III said defense requests for
interviews with the detainees present an unprecedented legal conflict
between a defense's right to speak with witnesses who could help a
defendant and the government's attempt to gather intelligence in the
war on terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Lindh's attorneys have demanded face-to-face interviews, but the
government has rejected such a procedure.</LD>
<TE>   Lindh, who is charged with conspiring to murder U.S. citizens,
appeared in the courtroom wearing glasses for the first time. His
mother, Marilyn Walker, sat in the second row, but Lindh's father,
Frank Lindh, did not attend the proceeding as he has in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Ellis, who set another hearing on the issue for May 28, said
defense lawyers seeking to interview potential witnesses would
normally have the right "to look them in the eye."</TE>
<TE>   But he said that, given national security concerns, that argument
"isn't going to persuade me for pretrial interviews."</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. John Davis said he wasn't sure the Defense
Department would even allow a video hookup because it could impede
intelligence gathering.</TE>
<TE>   If that were the case, the judge said, "the government would not
be able to proceed against this defendant."</TE>
<TE>   Ellis said he was thinking of allowing a video hookup so defense
lawyers could see the detainees and assess their credibility.</TE>
<TE>   The judge asked both sides to either reach an agreement between
themselves or present final legal briefs that would allow him to
resolve the issue.</TE>

<HD>Rescuer Nets His 'Angel of the Ashes'</HD>
<DH>Sept. 11: Firefighter, soothed by a caring backrub at
ground zero, returns favor with a ring.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>It all started with a Christmas Day massage at ground zero.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Dawna LoPiccolo, who soothed exhausted firefighter John Mraz
amid the debris of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, is planning their
wedding.</LD>
<LD>   "I met John in a 20-by-12 wood shack at ground zero. He was the
last man I massaged that day," said LoPiccolo, a massage therapist
who had volunteered to help rescue workers after the attacks.</LD>
<TE>   LoPiccolo, the single mother of a 2-year-old girl, and Mraz, the
widowed father of a 7-year-old boy, want to exchange vows under some
cross-shaped metal beams pulled from the debris.</TE>
<TE>   After volunteering her massages for months in the devastated city,
she asked to go to ground zero again in December.</TE>
<TE>   "I was driven. I said, 'I want to go back to ground zero on
Christmas.' Something kept pulling me," she said.</TE>
<TE>   As LoPiccolo walked past the debris on Christmas Day, she
recalled, she saw Mraz "sitting there, taking a break from raking
through the rubble."</TE>
<TE>   Having lost 25 firefighter friends, he was in a lineup of rescue
workers waiting for a massage. "It was cold, and I rubbed his
shoulders, his hands. I said, 'Don't worry, sweetie.'"</TE>
<TE>   Then, before returning to work, "he gave me this hug that knocked
my socks off!"</TE>
<TE>   He scribbled on her hardhat, "It was worth the wait," and signed
it "John, Engine 248."</TE>
<TE>   The 42-year-old firefighter, who lost his wife of 19 years last
May, said he "wasn't out looking for anybody." But he couldn't forget
the woman who had warmed his aching muscles on that winter day.</TE>
<TE>   Three days later, he phoned another firefighter who knew
LoPiccolo. Within 10 minutes, not knowing he was looking for her, she
called the same firefighter, "and I said, 'Do you remember that guy
John from Christmas?'"</TE>
<TE>   Their first date, just after New Year's, lasted 11 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Said Mraz: "It was like I knew her my whole life, like I knew her
from a past life. She is my angel of the ashes."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, she moved into his Brooklyn home. With a September
wedding in mind, he decided to give her an engagement ring.</TE>
<TE>   But the 35-year-old woman who grew up on Long Island didn't want a
diamond. Instead, her ring is set with a gold-charm Maltese
cross--the badge emblem of the New York Fire Department--and Mraz's
four-digit badge number.</TE>

<HD>Mouse Genome Is Offered Free on the Web</HD>
<DH>Science: It's a bargain for researchers, who use the rodent
to study many human ailments. A private firm charges thousands of
dollars for similar data.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSIE MESTEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Geneticists in the United States and Britain have completed a
sophisticated draft of the genome of the mouse, which they are making
generally available on the Internet--a boon to researchers who use
the rodent for studying a host of human ailments.</LD>
<LD>   The huge amount of data covers about 96% of the animal's genome.
The information will also be key to understanding the nearly
completed human genome because the two mammals are biologically
similar. Mice are important as a research tool--used to probe
everything from diabetes and Down's syndrome to asthma and
atherosclerosis.</LD>
<LD>   "It's totally cool. It's well ahead of where I think even the most
optimistic would have predicted," said Dr. Francis Collins, director
of the National Human Genome Research Institute, which co-funded this
latest phase of the mouse genome effort with the Wellcome Trust, a
British research-funding charity.</LD>
<TE>   A year ago, a group of scientists working for Celera Genomics
developed their own map of the mouse genome. But they only allow
other researchers to use it if they pay a fee of $8,000 to $13,000
annually for access--out of the price range of many researchers. The
new work, by contrast, is being made available free.</TE>
<TE>   "It's incredibly important to put this information into the public
domain," said Joe Takahashi, a geneticist at the Howard Hughes
Medical Institute at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., who
uses mice to study the nature of biological rhythms.</TE>
<TE>   Having the mouse genome will greatly speed up research, scientists
say--indeed, it already has, because portions of the data have been
dripping into the public domain for some time.</TE>
<TE>   Students used to spend entire graduate-school careers locating a
gene of interest or figuring out its structure.</TE>
<TE>   Now such steps can be accomplished within hours or days, said Marc
Tessier-Lavigne, a neuroscientist at the Howard Hughes Medical
Institute at Stanford University, who uses mice to study how nerves
wire up during development.</TE>
<TE>   "It represents an enormous, enormous timesaver," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A fully completed mouse genome, which will cover all but some
highly repetitive stretches of DNA that are too difficult to analyze,
is scheduled for 2005. But things are scurrying along so fast that it
probably will be wrapped up earlier, Collins said.</TE>
<TE>   The current draft was put together by a consortium of scientists
at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass., Washington University
in St. Louis, and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and European
Bionformatics Institute in Hinxton, England.</TE>
<TE>   The draft involved the assembly of data from 33 million different
chemical reactions, the scientists reported. It is more advanced than
was the human genome at an analogous stage, due to improved lab
technology as well as sophisticated software developed by members of
the consortium.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sort of a 'gee whiz' moment--we've got it, we're confident
of it and we're turning it over to everyone," says Dr. Robert
Waterston, head of the Washington University team.</TE>
<TE>   The consortium has not yet compared the mouse genome to the human
genome for clues to our strikingly similar biology yet obvious
dissimilarities in traits such as size, brain power and furriness.</TE>
<TE>   But they have noted some similarities and differences.</TE>
<TE>   The mouse genome, they report, is about 15% smaller than the human
genome. A total of 22,500 genes have been located so far. Scientists
predict they will ultimately locate about 30,000, a similar number to
that predicted for humans.</TE>
<TE>   There are some clear differences: Mice, for instance, have more
genes directing the production of smell receptors than do humans.</TE>
<TE>   But most of the genes appear structurally very similar to the
human set, implying that they do the same job. Differences between
mouse and man may depend more on how genes are turned on and off than
on the structure of the genes themselves, researchers say.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists are especially intrigued by a quarter-million genome
regions that are extremely similar in human and mouse but don't seem
to be part of traditional genes.</TE>
<TE>   Since these regions have been stable through 100 million years of
evolution--the time believed to have elapsed since the common
ancestor of mice and humans existed--they are presumably very
important, said Eric Lander, director of the Whitehead/MIT center.
But no one knows what they do.</TE>
<TE>   "It's exciting and humbling, as it should be," he said. "It's the
genome thumbing its nose at us and saying, 'There are lots more
mysteries than are contemplated in your philosophy.' "</TE>

<HD>Mideast 'Tilt' Also Vexed Nixon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>COLLEGE PARK, Md.</DL>
<LD>Richard Nixon, like other presidents, was dogged by perceptions that
U.S. policy in the Middle East was biased against Arabs. In papers
from his administration released Monday, he denied such a tilt.</LD>
<LD>   The long-tangled U.S. effort to broker peace in the region is laid
out in a trove of decades-old documents from Nixon's administration
that reads like headlines from today.</LD>
<LD>   In more than 107,000 pages of Nixon-era papers made public for the
first time, the president and his advisors are seen worrying over how
to prod Israel and its Arab neighbors toward peace in the Middle East
and trying to combat perceptions that the United States is anti-Arab.</LD>
<TE>   "Your help to Israel is seen as hostile to the Arab world," the
Saudi foreign minister tells the president in one 1973 meeting in the
Oval Office between U.S. officials and Arab leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Nixon, in response, acknowledges the perception that U.S.
administrations "are politically influenced too much on the side of
Israel." But he adds: "As far as I'm concerned I am not now, nor have
I ever been, nor will I ever be, affected by domestic politics in my
search for peace."</TE>
<TE>   He also assured Arab leaders that while Secretary of State Henry
A. Kissinger is Jewish, "he has the same goal as I have--a fair and
just settlement to all."</TE>
<TE>   "Some of my Arab friends, I know, have asked how they can trust
Dr. Kissinger," Nixon said. "But I can say that above all he wants a
fair and a just peace."</TE>
<TE>   Three decades later, the Bush administration is trying to counter
similar criticisms that U.S. peace efforts in the Middle East are
tilted toward Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "Talking points" for Nixon's 1973 conversation read like U.S.
policy statements from today.</TE>
<TE>   One recommended point for Nixon could be from current Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell's playbook: "Our position is that fighting
should stop and that it should be followed by a serious diplomatic
effort to reach a final peaceful settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "We stand willing to play a part in working for a just and durable
peace."</TE>
<TE>   The conversation took place weeks before Egypt and Syria attacked
Israeli forces in the Sinai and the Golan Heights in the Yom Kippur
War.</TE>
<TE>   The documents released Monday include records of Oval Office
conversations and telephone calls, papers preparing Nixon for
meetings and draft upon draft of evolving foreign policy initiatives.</TE>
<TE>   Nixon's handwriting is scrawled across some, telling aides "I
agree" or asking for specific follow-up actions or changes. Even now,
full pages are blacked out for national security reasons and stamped
"sanitized copy."</TE>

<HD>Missouri Stops Payments of Tax Refund Checks</HD>
<DH>Budget: The state cites a cash flow crisis in taking the
extreme measure. More than 400,000 have been told that they won't get
the money owed them any time soon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>The budget deficit is huge. Tax collection has been unexpectedly
skimpy. And the treasury is all but tapped out.</LD>
<LD>   So the state of Missouri has stopped sending out income tax
refunds. And there are no plans to put the checks in the mail any
time soon.</LD>
<LD>   State officials have told 415,500 taxpayers that their refund
checks--worth a total of $167 million--are on indefinite hold because
of an extreme cash flow crisis. "We really don't know how long it
will be," budget director Brian Long said.</LD>
<TE>   The move announced late last week is extreme. Illinois has delayed
refund payments a week or two because of a cash flow crunch. And
Alabama has put off paying most corporate tax refunds until the
economy rebounds. But several national experts on state finances said
Missouri appears to be alone in cutting off personal income tax
refunds.</TE>
<TE>   Or at least it's the only state to have announced such an
unpopular policy.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to think that the same discussion about at what point or
when [the treasury] can pay tax refunds is going on in several other
states right now ... because their circumstances are similar to those
in Missouri," said Harley Duncan, who directs the Federation of Tax
Administrators.</TE>
<TE>   Or, as budget analyst Arturo Perez put it: "Opening the [tax
return] mail can be slowed way down. That's the crude method of
delaying refunds."</TE>
<TE>   Several States Face Similar Fiscal Crunches</TE>
<TE>   Perez, a senior specialist with the National Conference of State
Legislatures, plans to start surveying budget directors today to find
out just how bad the April tax season has been--and how refunds are
being handled. California refunds are going out on schedule;
taxpayers who filed in mid-April should receive checks within six
weeks, according to the Franchise Tax Board.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence collected informally so far shows states across the
nation reporting an anemic tax collection season, at best.</TE>
<TE>   The reasons are obvious: With the economy in recession, many
people worked fewer hours or at lower-paying jobs last year, so they
owed the state less income tax. Even more significant, the drooping
stock market ensured that few investors had capital gains to
report--or pay taxes on.</TE>
<TE>   Budget directors anticipated such a downtick, of course,
especially after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks slammed an already
weak economy.</TE>
<TE>   But in many states the gloomy forecasts turned out to be not
gloomy enough.</TE>
<TE>   Missouri, for instance, predicted income tax collection in April
would run about $525 million, down 13% from the previous year.
"Frankly," Long said, "I thought we were being pessimistic enough."
He was wrong: The state took in just $420 million in April.</TE>
<TE>   Even in her small private practice, accountant Michelle Moon could
see the plunge. Client after client was getting unexpectedly large
refunds. Those who owed the state owed much less than in years past.</TE>
<TE>   "You could see the writing on the wall," said Moon, who works in
St. Charles, Mo. "You could tell the state was going to have to make
some drastic cuts because the money was not going to be there."</TE>
<TE>   'You Can't Spend What You Don't Take In'</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, despite a painful round of cuts last winter, Missouri is
facing a deficit of up to $250 million for the fiscal year ending
June 30.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers are now debating how to plug that hole. If they can
reach consensus, the state might have enough cash on hand to resume
refund payments next month. That's a big if, however, as the chief
proposal--to tap a rainy-day fund--has drawn ferocious opposition
from conservatives. House Republicans have already voted it down
once.</TE>
<TE>   Which leaves budget director Long in a tight spot.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't spend what you don't take in," he said, sighing.</TE>
<TE>   If the refund checks are delayed past Aug. 15, the state will owe
taxpayers interest at the rate of 6% a year. But that's small
consolation to the families who were counting on their money now, to
pay off credit card bills or remodel a bathroom or cover a summer
vacation.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Revenue estimates that 26% of those taxpayers
who are owed refunds are caught in the limbo.</TE>
<TE>   Among them is Tony Salvatore, an airline pilot from the St. Louis
suburbs who was expecting a $979 refund.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is terrible," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He's particularly steamed that lawmakers are considering a
$644-million plan to build a new baseball stadium for the St. Louis
Cardinals and refurbish stadiums in Kansas City when they cannot even
return him the $979 he overpaid in state taxes last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not an accountant," Salvatore said, "but it doesn't take a
genius to figure out that this state is going to get into serious
trouble if we keep going like this."</TE>

<HD>House Anti-Terrorism Plan Hikes Funding</HD>
<DH>Politics: A GOP leader proposes spending more than
President Bush requested for Pentagon and homeland security.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A leading House Republican on Monday proposed spending nearly $30
billion in an anti-terrorism bill, significantly more than President
Bush has sought.</LD>
<LD>   The plan by Rep. C.W. "Bill" Young (R-Fla.), chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee, is a sign of the mounting pressure on
Congress to expand funding for military operations overseas, security
programs at home and election-year political priorities.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal also will provide a critical test of how far Bush
will go to hold down spending--and how tough he will get with his own
party--as the federal budget returns to a deficit.</LD>
<TE>   With committee approval expected as early as Wednesday, the Young
plan appears likely to win backing from a large majority in the
GOP-led House. What's more, the amount of spending it proposes could
be raised by the Democrat-controlled Senate.</TE>
<TE>   In March, Bush asked for $27.1 billion to fund his war on
terrorism in an emergency spending bill for the 2002 fiscal year,
which ends Sept. 30.</TE>
<TE>   Young's $29.8-billion counterproposal, 10% more than the Bush
request, includes $1.8 billion more for the Pentagon, $500 million
more for homeland security and $650 million for an unrelated
priority: voting reform. It also includes some spending cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "The committee has developed a good, clean, responsible bill that
will enjoy broad bipartisan support," Young said. "The bill largely
reflects the president's request, with some improvements."</TE>
<TE>   The willingness by a leading Republican to raise the ante on
spending indicates the challenge Bush faces if he intends to contain
such efforts. So far, despite protests from fiscal conservatives in
his own party, the president has not issued an explicit veto threat
aimed at preventing an increase in his anti-terrorism proposal.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the White House Office of Management and Budget,
Amy Call, said Young's proposal was under review and would not
comment further.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) has
said he would prefer to simply approve what Bush asked for--and no
more. Armey spokesman Terry Holt said Monday that that is still his
position. But Holt said the GOP leadership would seek to gauge the
reaction of rank-and-file lawmakers to Young's plan.</TE>
<TE>   A springtime ritual on Capitol Hill, emergency spending bills have
become important legislative vehicles for congressional priorities,
and this year's version is sure to be no exception. House Republican
leaders have spoken, for instance, of attaching a controversial
provision that would raise the limit on the amount of money the
government can borrow. That debt ceiling has been tested in recent
months as the Bush administration has scrambled to meet government
obligations.</TE>
<TE>   The Young proposal includes money for voting reform, in
anticipation of final congressional approval of a landmark bill to
overhaul election procedures nationwide. The $650 million would help
states get a jump-start on fixing antiquated voting systems before
the 2004 elections.</TE>
<TE>   It also includes $1 billion to fix a shortfall in a federal
program for college tuition grants to low-income students. In so
doing, Young omitted a controversial administration proposal to fill
the funding shortage by changing a federal student loan program in a
way that could raise interest rates for many students.</TE>
<TE>   Other major provisions in the bill would:</TE>
<TE>   * Grant the Pentagon $15.8 billion for its operations in
Afghanistan and elsewhere. The money would help pay for call-ups of
military reservists, training expenses, spare parts, maintenance and
other costs. Three MH-47 special operations helicopters destroyed in
recent operations would be replaced for $93 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Spend about $5.8 billion on homeland security measures. More
money would be spent on the Coast Guard, the Army Corps of Engineers,
federal nuclear facilities and law enforcement. The Immigration and
Naturalization Service would receive an additional $25 million to
help track immigration violators.</TE>
<TE>   * Give Bush $5.5 billion in aid that he sought to help New York
recover from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The appropriations chairman sought to pay for the various
increases by cutting $1.5 billion in funds already approved and
scaling back some proposed spending. His spokesman declined Monday to
elaborate on the cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Young trimmed a Bush request for funding for airport security, a
potential area of controversy. The Transportation Security
Administration would receive $4 billion under Young's plan, $400
million less than the administration sought.</TE>

<HD>Army Chief Digs In Over Flap</HD>
<DH>Military: Defense Secretary Rumsfeld scrutinizes the
service over a weaponry dispute.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Army Secretary Thomas E. White has no plans to resign despite
criticism from Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld over the service
resisting cancellation of its controversial new $11-billion artillery
system, Army officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   But Pentagon officials said White is on a collision course with
Rumsfeld after last week's thrust to get support in Congress for the
long-range self-propelled 155-millimeter Crusader howitzer after
White was told it was being scrapped.</LD>
<LD>   "As far as I know, Secretary White has told aides that he has no
intention of resigning," one senior Army official, who asked not to
be identified, told Reuters.</LD>
<TE>   But two senior Pentagon officials, who also asked not to be
identified, said the Army's inspector general was expected to send
the results of an investigation to Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D.
Wolfowitz as early as today.</TE>
<TE>   "Secretary Rumsfeld has not accused Secretary White of anything,"
one of the officials said. "But the secretary is serious about
accepting decisions."</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon announced an inquiry Friday into whether the Army
tried to thwart cancellation of the system, which is at the heart of
a debate over how best to modernize the military.</TE>
<TE>   The conflict over the Crusader is part of Rumsfeld's effort to
cancel what he deems outdated weapon programs despite vested
interests.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon spokeswoman Victoria Clarke said last week that Rumsfeld
planned to hold accountable anyone found guilty of "inappropriate
behavior."</TE>
<TE>   White was told of the planned cancellation of the Crusader by
Wolfowitz on April 30. "Sometime after the deputy met with Secretary
White ... , there were people making comments, there were talking
points and fax sheets being sent around that did not support that
direction," Clarke said.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CONIFER, Colo.</DL>
<LD>Calmer winds helped firefighters slow the spread Monday of a 250-acre
wildfire that forced 2,400 people to flee their homes in the
pine-covered foothills west of Denver.</LD>
<LD>   The blaze had come within a quarter-mile of at least one house and
within two miles of subdivisions in the area. Officials estimated the
fire was only 10% contained.</LD>
<LD>   The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office evacuated everyone within
two miles of the fire Sunday, calling 1,700 homes in about five
subdivisions. The blaze is about 25 miles from Denver.</LD>
<TE>   Steve Nemeth and his wife, whose home is about a mile from the
fire, grabbed pictures, clothes and their dog and cat when the
evacuation order came. On Monday, they waited at a shelter.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of sentimental stuff we can't replace. We got the
family together. That's what counts," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the fire was not immediately known.</TE>
<TE>   Also Monday, grass fires outside Colorado Springs, Colo., burned
more than 6,000 acres and caused the local airport to adjust flight
patterns to avoid thick plumes of smoke. The fires also closed roads,
threatened structures and forced the evacuation of some farm animals.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Melissa Hartman, spokeswoman for El Paso County Sheriff's
Office, said the blaze was contained in about three hours.</TE>
<TE>   After a dry winter, more than 400 wildfires have burned about
15,600 acres in Colorado this year, according to the Rocky Mountain
Area Coordinating Center of the National Interagency Fire Center.</TE>
<TE>   In New Mexico, meanwhile, a fast-moving wildfire in the Santa Fe
National Forest burned up to 700 acres within several hours Monday.
Residents in Dalton and Pecos canyons were asked to leave, fire
information officer Claudia Standish said. Several campgrounds and
about 400 homes are in the area, state police said.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Herrera learned of the fire while at work in Santa Fe. He
rushed to his home and spotted flames on the top of a nearby ridge.</TE>
<TE>   Erratic wind fanned the flames, sending thick billowing clouds of
gray smoke into the sky about 15 miles east of Santa Fe. Fire
information officer Christa Orozco said the blaze was caused by
humans, but the exact cause was not known. Also in New Mexico, a
15,400-acre wildfire near Mayhill has destroyed 13 homes and 27
garages or other buildings and was 75% contained Monday night,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   It was started accidentally last week by a man who later committed
suicide.</TE>

<HD>Devil Ray Streak Hits 11 in Loss to Red Sox</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Tampa Bay Devil Rays didn't take any solace in playing the
first-place Boston Red Sox close again.</LD>
<LD>   The Devil Rays lost for a team record-tying 11th consecutive time
Monday night, falling to the Red Sox, 5-3, after loading the bases
with one out in the ninth inning at St. Petersburg, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Tim Wakefield, who pitched three innings to earn his second save,
got Russ Johnson to ground into a double play to finish a four-game
sweep. Boston won its sixth in a row and leads the majors with a 21-7
record.</LD>
<TE>   The ill-timed double play was the first the Devil Rays have hit
into during their losing streak. Tampa Bay has not scored a run in
the ninth inning this season.</TE>
<TE>   Boston Manager Grady Little normally would call on Ugueth Urbina
to pitch the ninth. But Little wanted to give his closer a rest after
Urbina earned saves in three consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   Rey Sanchez drove in two runs as the Red Sox increased their lead
in the American League East to five games over idle New York.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay's slide matches the club record set June 30-July 13,
1998, and also equals the longest losing streak in the majors this
year. Detroit opened the season with 11 consecutive losses.</TE>
<TE>   The Devil Rays have been outscored, 58-28, and outhomered, 11-5,
during the streak, and Tampa Bay has dropped four games after taking
a lead into the ninth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Daubach hit a solo homer off Tanyon Sturtze (0-4) in the
seventh inning, giving Darren Oliver (4-1) a 5-1 lead. Wakefield
replaced the Boston starter after Oliver gave up a two-run homer to
Toby Hall in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   The Devil Rays loaded the bases without getting the ball out of
the infield in the ninth. Greg Vaughn walked, then Wakefield threw
wildly to second after fielding Steve Cox's grounder and gave up an
infield single to Chris Gomez.</TE>
<TE>   But Johnson's grounder ended the threat.</TE>
<TE>   Oliver, coming off a shutout against Baltimore, gave up three runs
and five hits in six-plus innings.</TE>
<TE>   Brent Abernathy had the only hits off Oliver--two singles and a
solo homer--until Cox opened the Tampa Bay seventh with a double and
Hall followed with his first home run of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 6, Chicago 5--Gabe Kapler made up for two earlier errors
with a key defensive play and a game-winning sacrifice fly in the
ninth for the Rangers at Arlington, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Kapler's short fly to left field was deep enough to score Rafael
Palmeiro, who led off the ninth by drawing a walk from Antonio Osuna
(3-1). Palmeiro had gone to third on Rusty Greer's single, his third
hit of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Hideki Irabu (1-2), the sixth Texas pitcher, worked the ninth.
Magglio Ordonez, who earlier had hit his seventh home run, had a
two-out single in the ninth, but was thrown out by Kapler trying to
stretch the hit into a double.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 3, Detroit 1--Jacque Jones drove in three runs and the
Minnesota bullpen picked up for injured starter Rick Reed at
Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Reed (4-1) threw only 62 pitches in five innings but left with a
strained right forearm. He gave up five hits, a run and a walk while
striking out four.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Fiore, Mike Jackson and J.C. Romero held the Tigers scoreless
for three innings and Eddie Guardado pitched a perfect ninth for his
12th save in as many chances.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 9, Baltimore 4--Brady Anderson, making his return to
Camden Yards, doubled and scored the tiebreaking run on Jolbert
Cabrera's bad-hop single in the eighth to help the Indians win at
Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Thome, Russell Branyan and Matt Lawton homered for the
Indians, who have won three in a row following a six-game skid.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>For Spiezio, Walking Isn't a Contradiction</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First baseman Scott Spiezio came up in the Oakland organization,
which insists players master the art of taking a walk if they want to
advance through the minor leagues.</LD>
<LD>   Spiezio ranks second among the Angels in walks, even though he
spotted his teammates a week because of his season-opening
suspension, and ranks second among the starters in on-base
percentage, despite a .262 batting average. So does his training in
the A's system help explain his success?</LD>
<LD>   "Maybe subconsciously," he said. "It's not something I'm conscious
of. If it's a pitch I like, I'll hack at it. It's not like Oakland,
where I'm taking the first pitch and taking 2-0 and 3-1."</LD>
<TE>   The A's proudly point to their emphasis on drawing walks as one
reason for their recent success. In the minor leagues, Spiezio said,
the A's eliminate players without enough walks from consideration for
monthly awards, "even if you hit .400 with 10 home runs during the
month."</TE>
<TE>   In the majors, he said, "[General Manager] Billy Beane would even
come through the clubhouse after a game and say, 'Why did you swing
at the first pitch when the last guy walked on four pitches?'"</TE>
<TE>   In spring training, Angel coaches stressed the need for players to
take more pitches and get more walks, putting more runners on base
and tiring opposing pitchers. The hitters were receptive but Spiezio
believes that aspect of hitting is best taught in the formative years
in the minor leagues, the way the A's do it.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to start early," he said. "It's hard once you get to the
major leagues to start learning that."</TE>

<HD>Little Goes Long Way for Eckstein</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Angel shortstop, generously listed at 5 feet 8,
had to battle just to get to the majors. He isn't about to stop
working hard now that he's made it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The bus was rolling along the highway, carrying the University of
Georgia's baseball team back to campus after a weekend series in
Florida. The players were kidding the assistant coach about his kid
brother. They had seen the major league highlights on ESPN, which
showed the kid brother hitting a grand slam for the Angels, and they
had heard the announcers call the little guy a ridiculously unlikely
candidate to hit a slam.</LD>
<LD>   Rick Eckstein took the teasing in stride. He was used to it. The
Angels list David Eckstein as 5 feet 8, and they're rounding up.</LD>
<LD>   As the players laughed about the little guy hitting the big fly,
Rick's cell phone rang. Mom was calling. Rick nodded, smiled broadly,
and made an announcement to the players who could hardly believe
David had hit a grand slam.</LD>
<TE>   "He just hit another," Rick said.</TE>
<TE>   Two grand slams in two days, by a guy who had never hit one in his
life? This was great stuff, and the national media anointed the
Angels' shortstop the unofficial hero of the week. The New York Times
called. Major League Baseball featured him on its official radio
show.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN practically adopted him and turned him into a multimedia
sensation. You could chat with him on ESPN's Web site, read about him
elsewhere on the site and in ESPN magazine, hear from him on the ESPN
radio network.</TE>
<TE>   Many players relish their turn in the spotlight. Eckstein? He
would just as soon retreat to the shadows. He is pleasant and
cooperative but genuinely humble, and he doesn't believe his grand
slam exploits have made him--gasp!--a famous person.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as we keep winning games, that's all I care about," he
said. "What I've done in the past will not help me when I step on the
field the next day."</TE>
<TE>   Said Rick, "I don't think there's time in David's day to bask in
the glory. He's still fighting to prove he belongs there."</TE>
<TE>   His teammates do not begrudge Eckstein his moment in the sun.
Asked what the chances were of Eckstein's developing a big head,
outfielder Darin Erstad said, "Zero." He paused, then revised his
answer.</TE>
<TE>   "Less than zero," Erstad said. "He's worked so hard to get here
and beaten all the odds. He was just born with a gift to keep driving
himself."</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein, 27, says his parents are his heroes. He is the son of
teachers, Whitey and Patricia Eckstein, who instilled in their five
children the pride that compels David, the youngest, never to settle
for less than his best--in every swing, every practice, every game.</TE>
<TE>   He draws inspiration from his oldest brother, Kenny, and his
sisters, Christine and Susan. They all required kidney transplants,
for a condition for which David and Rick tested negative. Today, the
three siblings are healthy.</TE>
<TE>   But whenever yet another skeptic would taunt Eckstein about how
the big leagues were no place for such a little guy, he would smile
and think of his oldest brother and, especially, his sisters.</TE>
<TE>   He couldn't play baseball for a living? Doctors told his sisters
they could not be mothers, that the transplants would make
childbearing virtually impossible. Today, Christine has three kids
and Susan has two.</TE>
<TE>   "With everything my brother and sisters went through, those are
definitely people I look up to," he said. "Living life daily was a
chore for them."</TE>
<TE>   There is no facade in this family. Mark Ellis, a minor league
infielder for the Oakland A's, played shortstop for the University of
Florida when Eckstein played second base there. When the players
worked out together last winter in Sanford, Fla., Ellis moved in with
Eckstein and his parents.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the most genuine person I've ever met," Ellis said. "They're
the greatest family I've ever met."</TE>
<TE>   Good kid, good family, good job--but no girlfriend. Eckstein, 27,
insists he would have no patience for a woman interested in him
because he plays baseball.</TE>
<TE>   He says, almost apologetically, that he might not be too much fun
in a relationship anyway. He does not hit the town after games. He
won't take a chance on cutting back on his daily workout routine, so
he arrives at Edison Field by 2 p.m. for a 7 p.m. game.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my job, and I take it very seriously," he said. "I need
to get my sleep. I don't go out too much."</TE>
<TE>   All that hard work counted for little two years ago, when two
Boston Red Sox hitting coaches decided Eckstein needed to alter his
stance and swing. He had hit better than .300 in each of his three
minor league seasons, but he shrugged and adapted, at least until the
results became so poor he finally spoke up.</TE>
<TE>   "I was at .160 when I said, 'I can't do this anymore,'" he said.</TE>
<TE>   That was in June. He was at .246 in triple A in August, when the
Red Sox put him on waivers.</TE>
<TE>   The names of hundreds of players appear on the waiver wire each
season, and a lucky team can find a reliever or pinch-hitter there.
The Angels claimed Al Levine and Ben Weber on waivers. Starting
shortstops are not supposed to be found there.</TE>
<TE>   When Eckstein's name appeared on the waiver wire, Angel General
Manager Bill Stoneman nodded in recognition. Gary Sutherland, one of
his assistants, had recommended Eckstein after watching him in the
Arizona Fall League. Sutherland's brother Dale, an Angel scout, had
watched Eckstein in the Boston organization and recommended him. So
had another Angel scout, Jon Neiderer.</TE>
<TE>   Said Stoneman, "Gary just kept saying, 'Hey, there's something
about this guy.' He's not what you call a scout's player. He's not a
multi-tooled player. He just comes to play baseball."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels sent him to their triple-A club, where he hit .346 in
15 games. In spring training last year, they made a utility infielder
out of him. When second baseman Adam Kennedy suffered a broken hand,
Eckstein started the season at second.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels had projected a double-play combination of Kennedy and
Gary DiSarcina, attempting a comeback from shoulder surgery. "We were
hoping DiSar would come back to be DiSar," Stoneman said.</TE>
<TE>   The comeback failed, and they opened the season with a double-play
combination of Eckstein and Benji Gil. When Kennedy returned, 10 days
into the season, the Angels moved Eckstein and his .406 average to
shortstop.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone's always doubted him," said Ellis, his college teammate.
"No one ever thought he would even get drafted. Now he's a starting
shortstop in the big leagues. He always seems to get the job done."</TE>
<TE>   That he does, one way or another, in ways that do not usually
interest the national media but nonetheless thrill the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   He has started every game this season. He's not the fastest guy on
the team, but he's got the most stolen bases. He has not hit into a
double play. He leads the league in getting hit by pitches. In this
strikeout-happy era, he has as many walks as strikeouts and has the
best on-base percentage among Angel regulars. He batted twice Sunday
with runners on third base, producing a sacrifice fly each time.</TE>
<TE>   The grand slams startled him, and concerned him, because he
normally hits ground balls and line drives. He's not strong enough to
hit fly balls out of the park with any consistency, the grand slams
notwithstanding. The road to major league success was daunting enough
for him without his hitting a bunch of harmless fly balls to the
warning track.</TE>
<TE>   He figured that out as a little kid. The grand slams were his
first anywhere--majors, minors, college, T-ball, wherever.</TE>
<TE>   He might be the one ballplayer in America who never entertained
the grand-slam dream. The fantasy is standard-issue for just about
every kid who ever picks up a bat: Coming up with two out and the
bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth inning, then hitting the
game-winning grand slam.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Eckstein never imagined himself in that situation. He
did, and he dreamed about delivering the game-winning hit. And what
was that hit?</TE>
<TE>   He remembered, as best he could, and laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably," he said, "just a single up the middle."</TE>

<HD>Home Isn't Sweet for Griffey Jr.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ken Griffey Jr. is tired of how he's being treated in his hometown.</LD>
<LD>   The injured Cincinnati Red outfielder lashed out Monday at the way
fans and the media have kept him in the spotlight since he came home
in a February 2000 trade with the Seattle Mariners.</LD>
<LD>   With Griffey hurt again, some fans are questioning whether the
trade was worthwhile.</LD>
<TE>   "I get consistently beat up for no reason," Griffey said, sitting
in his locker after batting practice. "It's been happening since the
very first day I got here, and I'm tired of it. You try to bend over
backward to do the right thing, and it just seems to get thrown in my
face.</TE>
<TE>   "I came here to play baseball. I took less money. I didn't whine
or anything, and this is the thanks I get? I don't need that."</TE>
<TE>   Griffey tore the patella tendon in his right knee on April 7 and
is on the disabled list. There's no target date for his return, which
is expected sometime in the next few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Griffey said he has been treated worse in Cincinnati than he was
in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he wants to leave Cincinnati, Griffey said, "I just want
to play. I just want to get back on the field."</TE>
<TE>   He said his wife and children don't come to Cinergy Field very
often anymore because of comments they hear.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Texas Rangers' Chan Ho Park threw 80 pitches in a simulated
game and said he was ready to return. Park is on the disabled list
because of a pulled right hamstring, an injury he aggravated in his
Rangers' debut April 1. He initially got hurt in a spring training
game March 27.... The Chicago Cubs put catcher Todd Hundley on the
15-day disabled list because of a left thumb bruise and activated
third baseman Bill Mueller.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Englishman John Collinson, 36, made a modest living diving for lost
balls in golf course ponds and selling them for 20 cents each ... and
now he is in jail for trespassing.</LD>
<LD>   Police, ever vigilant, caught Collinson, equipped with a rubber
diving suit at a course in England several months ago.</LD>
<LD>   He told a jury last week he had even filed taxes on his earnings,
roughly $21,500 a year, but a judge jailed him anyway.</LD>
<TE>   "Rough justice," read an editorial in the Daily Telegraph. "On the
scale of human wickedness, John Collinson's crime registers barely a
blip."</TE>
<TE>   If that.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the record for scoring average in one NBA
playoff series?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   That's hockey: Hubert Mizell in the St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times:
"Let's ease off baseball's Bud Selig, with Gary Bettman of the NHL
becoming 'least courageous' among commissioners, refusing to
adequately hammer a sickening array of playoff thugs."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Mizell: "You may argue, but I think the top fight songs, in
order, belong to Michigan, Notre Dame, Southern California and
Wisconsin."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Up to date: Peter Clark in the Gallery column in the San Diego
Union-Tribune: "About 45 minutes after the Kentucky Derby was over,
the DJ on B94.9FM read the race results--from last year's race.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, Gallery realizes it's an oldies San Diego station, but that's
going too far.</TE>
<TE>   (Note: The DJ corrected himself about 10 minutes later)."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ever vigilant: Steve Hummer in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution:
"Reading about the Falcons' Chris Draft [a former Stanford player]
and his rescue of a motorist from a burning car, it is good to know
that if you ever run into trouble on the highway at 3:30 in the
morning, there are many brave professional athletes out at that hour,
on patrol."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Intimidated: Jerry Greene in the Orlando Sentinel: "Everybody
hates seeing the Florida Marlins play in an NFL stadium in
Miami--including Marlin slugger Cliff Floyd, who says, 'I hate
hitting at home. Just the park itself. It's huge and you feel like
you've got to crush everything you hit.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   He won't go away: Bob Molinaro in the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot:
"Just when you thought it was safe to turn on your TV, Mel Kiper Jr.
releases his top 15 picks for next year's draft."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Beneath him: Mike Bianchi in the Orlando Sentinel: "Jerry West
taking over the Memphis Grizzlies? Isn't that sort of like Bruce
Springsteen taking over the Monkees?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Jerry West of the Lakers, 46.3 points against
Baltimore in 1965, six games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: On HBO's "On the Record With Bob Costas," fight
promoter Don King said that after prevailing a few years ago in a
federal tax trial, he took the jury to London to attend a heavyweight
title fight and put the group up at a luxury hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Added King, "I not only took that jury to London, I took the next
jury to the Bahamas."</TE>
<TE>   Replied Costas, "Normally, people try to get out of jury duty, but
in your case they're lined up around the block."</TE>

<HD>Perez Making It Look Easy</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Carefree Dodger left-hander has proven to be much
more than a Sheffield trade throw-in.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A half hour before Sunday's Cinco de Mayo game against the Chicago
Cubs, a mariachi band played near the Dodger Stadium backstop. Dodger
pitcher Odalis Perez sidled up next to a guy strumming a guitar and
grooved to the music.</LD>
<LD>   An hour before Perez was to pitch against the Cincinnati Reds last
Thursday night, the 23-year-old left-hander, a huge grin on his face,
bobbed and weaved to the merengue tunes blaring on the clubhouse
stereo, forming a one-man conga line as he headed out the door to
warm up.</LD>
<LD>   Big league pressure? If this kid were any more carefree, he'd ride
his bike to the park with his glove on the handlebars, baseball cards
flapping in the spokes and a pocketful of bubble gum.</LD>
<TE>   "I've always been a happy-go-lucky guy, for as long as I can
remember," said Perez, who takes a 3-1 record and 1.75 earned-run
average into this week's series against the Atlanta Braves, the
organization he spent seven years with before being traded to the
Dodgers in January.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, I go through bad things in life, but at the same time,
I don't even think about those things. I just keep doing what I'm
doing."</TE>
<TE>   Perez has dealt with the bad. In 1999 he underwent Tommy John
surgery, an elbow reconstruction that forced him to miss the second
half of the 1999 season and the entire 2000 season.</TE>
<TE>   Last October, Perez's 26-year-old half-brother, Tomas, was killed
in an automobile accident in the Dominican Republic, leaving behind a
wife, a 3-year-old son and a number of grieving relatives.</TE>
<TE>   "We were tight," said Perez, who grew up with three brothers and
four half-sisters in Las Matas de Farfan, Dominican Republic. "Tomas
had a great relationship with my dad--he was the one who ran some of
my father's farms in the Dominican. He was a great kid, my brother,
and I wish he was alive. But at the same time, I can do nothing about
it, so I have to keep living, keep moving ahead."</TE>
<TE>   Perez has taken a quantum leap forward this season. A former No. 5
starter who shuttled between the Brave rotation and bullpen last
year, Perez, acquired with outfielder Brian Jordan for Dodger slugger
Gary Sheffield, has emerged as one of the game's best young pitchers
in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Mixing changeups and sliders with well-located 91-mph fastballs,
Perez has two complete games and one shutout and has struck out 30
and walked only three in 461/3 innings. He has limited opponents to a
league-best .159 batting average and a league-best .183 on-base
percentage and is yet to allow a first-inning hit.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the numbers is an air of confidence and maturity that belie
his age. Perez is aggressive and is not afraid to pitch inside--he
brushed back Giant shortstop Rich Aurilia and hit slugger Barry Bonds
in the shoulder in his first Dodger start April 4--and he's about as
unflappable as a Buckingham Palace guard.</TE>
<TE>   After hearing all the horror stories about the Coors Field
hitter's haven, Perez pitched a complete game against the Colorado
Rockies on April 15, limiting them to five hits in a 5-2 Dodger
victory.</TE>
<TE>   The following week, Perez, unfazed by 43-degree temperatures and
15-mph winds in frigid Wrigley Field, tossed a one-hit shutout
against the Chicago Cubs on April 26, facing the minimum 27 batters
and coming within one bad-hop single of a perfect game.</TE>
<TE>   "The way he walks around, he has a lot of confidence, but it's a
positive confidence," Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca said. "Some guys
think they're the best thing to walk the earth--that's a negative
confidence. Odalis isn't like that at all. He walks to the mound
feeling like he's the best pitcher ever, and that's how he pitches."</TE>
<TE>   Perez will not walk to the Turner Field mound Wednesday with the
intention of sticking it to the Braves, even though Atlanta coaches
always stressed working the outside corner when Perez knew his
strength was pitching inside, and even though Manager Bobby Cox
usually skipped Perez in the rotation if his spot fell on an off day.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not out to show them anything, because they didn't want to
trade me," Perez said. "I have nothing against the Braves. I'm a
professional."</TE>
<TE>   Perez went 11-15 with a 5.38 ERA in 52 games for the Braves, 33 of
them starts, from 1998-2001, but he never had the kind of confidence
that he has now. It was hard to get too comfortable when you were
always looking over your shoulder, wondering if this would be your
last game as a starter or how you'd ever measure up to the lofty
standards set by Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew if I got the opportunity to pitch every five days that I'd
do the job," Perez said. "When we came out of spring training and
[Dodger Manager Jim Tracy] told me I'd be the No. 3 starter, and I
knew I'd be out there every five days, it made me feel good, because
they believed in what I had and thought I could do the job."</TE>
<TE>   During trade talks for Sheffield, Atlanta General Manager John
Schuerholz pushed right-handers Kevin Millwood and Jason Marquis, but
Dodger General Manager Dan Evans wanted a left-hander, and his scouts
were persistent in their endorsement of Perez.</TE>
<TE>   "When the trade was made, a lot of people focused on Brian Jordan,
but with us, it was always Jordan and Perez," Evans said. "We thought
Odalis was on the brink of becoming a really solid major league
pitcher, and he's exactly what we thought he'd be, a real solid
left-hander. He knows his stuff is good enough to get people out, and
he trusts his stuff. I'm sure he'll hit some bumps, but he's on a
great run right now."</TE>
<TE>   Perez is on such a good run--he's 3-0 with a 1.33 ERA in his last
five starts--that if he continues to pitch like this, and Sheffield
(.230) and Jordan (.248) continue to struggle, that January deal may
come to be known as the Odalis Perez trade, and not the Gary
Sheffield trade.</TE>
<TE>   "You had to look at the trade as Sheffield for Jordan, because
they're established players, and I was one of the main guys in
Atlanta's future," Perez said. "But maybe now people will see the
trade differently. Maybe I'll be the guy who takes the Dodgers to the
World Series. You never know."</TE>

Dodgers are 5-0 against left-handed starters, and catcher Paul Lo

<HD>Generation Gap</HD>
<DH>Traditional Sports Don't Have Same Pull With Today's Teens</DH>
<SE>THE FUTURE  OF PRO SPORTS Third in a three-part series:
Traditional sports are losing young fans to everything from video
games to snowboarding. With fewer kids watching and, in some cases,
playing, the industry is scrambling to be relevant to a generation
unlike any that came before.</SE>
<AU>DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is still something of a kid in David Baker, his toothy grin,
the eagerness with which he recalls growing up in Downey in the
1960s. His childhood was marked by seasons: football in the fall,
basketball in winter, summer evenings with Vin Scully and the
Dodgers.</LD>
<LD>   "I had a transistor radio," he said. "I listened under the covers
because I was supposed to be asleep."</LD>
<LD>   A part of him mourns the passing of that era but, as commissioner
of the Arena Football League, Baker cannot spend too much time
looking back.</LD>
<TE>   "Now you have 500 TV channels and countless video games, film
rentals, computers," he said. "You have kids with cell phones and
Palm Pilots and they have schedules to keep."</TE>
<TE>   His teenage sons are prime examples, and Baker keeps them in mind
as he tries to attract new fans to his league. Forget the sheaves of
marketing research that cross his desk, he takes Benjamin and Sam to
games and asks their opinion.</TE>
<TE>   "What you have is a more informed, more sophisticated young fan
who has more things competing for his time," Baker said. "Kids
gravitate toward whatever grabs their attention."</TE>
<TE>   With rapid-fire scoring, players bouncing off walls and rock music
blaring from loudspeakers--football as an extreme sport--the Arena
game has made some inroads with this elusive audience. Other leagues
have not fared as well.</TE>
<TE>   The new generation is gradually losing interest in traditional
sports, according to several key indicators.</TE>
<TE>   While a majority of kids in the U.S. still follow pro football,
basketball and baseball, a national poll shows the 12- to 17-year-old
fan base eroding in the last six years.</TE>
<TE>   Children still flock to youth leagues, but teen participation has
dropped, especially when compared with the boom in snowboarding and
skateboarding.</TE>
<TE>   Even more important to the business of sport, television ratings
for the under-18 crowd are shaky. Data compiled by Nielsen Media
Research suggests the Big Four--the NFL, NBA, NHL and Major League
Baseball--are playing to older audiences.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the viewership for an average pro football game on
broadcast television. Over the last decade, the 50-plus crowd grew by
3% to almost a quarter of the total. The under-18 segment shrank from
13% to 10%.</TE>
<TE>   Add this demographic shift to a list of concerns for a
multibillion-dollar industry already facing a decline in overall
ratings and sluggish attendance. Baker is not the only one worried
about courting a generation unlike any that came before.</TE>
<TE>   "We will succeed or fail on how intelligently we work through
these developments," NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said at a recent
industry conference. "All of our fans in the 21st century are going
to be different than they were in the 20th century."</TE>
<TE>   Shorter Attention Spans</TE>
<TE>   It is difficult to take an exact snapshot of the situation because
different entities measure preferences differently. But the problem
appears to begin when kids go outside to play. As NHL Commissioner
Gary Bettman said: "There's a whole lot of competition out there."</TE>
<TE>   The number of U.S. children in youth football, basketball,
baseball and hockey leagues remained steady or increased during the
1990s, according to the National Sporting Goods Assn. But teen
participation fell off by as much as 23%.</TE>
<TE>   During the same period, the number of children and teens involved
with skateboarding, snowboarding and in-line skating jumped by as
much as 538%.</TE>
<TE>   This trend worries executives such as Tim Leiweke, president of
the Kings and Staples Center, who said: "If they're not playing
traditional sports, that means they're not watching traditional
sports."</TE>
<TE>   His fears are corroborated by the ESPN Sports Poll, which suggests
that fewer U.S. teens call themselves fans of the Big Four. The NFL's
popularity slipped by 3% from 1995 to 2001, the NHL's by almost 14%.</TE>
<TE>   Some industry observers suspect a backlash against pro sports'
corporate image, the astronomical player salaries and ubiquitous
sponsor logos. That would help explain the success of the upstart
Arena league, which showed a slight increase in the ESPN poll, and
extreme sports.</TE>
<TE>   Television ratings might be suffering for yet another reason.
Researchers in New Jersey have found that kids have so many
entertainment choices, they tend to flit from one thing to another.</TE>
<TE>   "They are used to video games and doing things quickly," said
David Tice, vice president of Knowledge Networks/Statistical
Research. "Kids just don't have the attention span to watch games
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Ratings for the under-18 crowd will continue to decrease, Tice
predicted, especially during the regular season when "so many teams
make it to the playoffs in most leagues, there's not a lot of
incentive to sit through a whole game when it's not really
meaningful."</TE>
<TE>   Baseball is considered vulnerable because of its unhurried pace. A
recent effort to speed up games might not be enough, said David
Carter of the Sports Business Group, a Los Angeles consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   "Where's the marketing sizzle?" he asked. "Just because a Royals
game is four minutes shorter...."</TE>
<TE>   Boxing also has suffered, lacking a marquee star and all but
disappearing from broadcast television. While showing an uptick in
the ESPN poll, it ranked below the likes of gymnastics and ice
skating in a Knowledge Networks survey of what kids watch.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking at an industry conference last month, HBO Sports
President Ross Greenburg joked that his network is doing everything
it can to hang onto its older boxing viewers: "We now have a research
and development team working in our labs to create immortality so no
human being will die, and everyone will continue to watch."</TE>
<TE>   They are testing the pill on Larry Merchant, he said.</TE>
<TE>   A Different Consumer</TE>
<TE>   Not all the numbers are ominous. When Knowledge Networks conducted
research for ESPN and the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles
last spring, 93% of boys and girls said they watch, listen to or read
about some kind of sports. The ESPN poll suggests, despite decreases
in popularity, the NFL and NBA still attract about three-quarters of
U.S. teens.</TE>
<TE>   The industry takes encouragement from these findings.</TE>
<TE>   "Sports are still pervasive," said Artie Bulgrin, an ESPN senior
vice president. "The difference is the way they are being consumed."</TE>
<TE>   His argument goes like this: When kids gather in the hallway at
school, they still want to talk about how Barry Bonds did last night,
just like their fathers once talked about Hank Aaron. But with their
attention pulled in so many directions, they need the information
delivered in new ways.</TE>
<TE>   Sports Web sites have succeeded in reaching a generation that
spends much of its time online. At ESPN, quick-hit highlight shows
such as "SportsCenter" and "Baseball Tonight" rank with the X Games
in attracting young audiences.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids get the same value without having to watch a 21/2-hour
game," Bulgrin said. "It allows them to squeeze all those other
things in."</TE>
<TE>   The networks aren't alone in trying to accommodate the new
generation. Hockey is considering three rule changes, including
quicker faceoffs, to speed things up. Teams have adopted hipper
uniforms and marketing campaigns. In Washington, the Capitals
enlisted a popular disc jockey to promote the team.</TE>
<TE>   Some in the industry even think they can attract young fans with
video games made realistic enough to show famous players' faces. Tice
said: "It's probably true, just as much as kids who played
Strat-O-Matic baseball grew up with a healthy interest in that
sport."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the Big Four have asked players to be more
fan-friendly by signing autographs and making community appearances.
They have spent millions on youth leagues such as NFL Flag, the Jr.
NBA and Jr. WNBA, the idea being that today's athletes become
tomorrow's fans.</TE>
<TE>   Skeptics question this assumption, arguing that a boom in youth
participation has failed to produce commensurate ticket sales or
television ratings for Major League Soccer. But researchers believe
soccer--and hockey--suffer from a peculiar dynamic.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of it has to do with what's important in our culture," Tice
said. "[Young players] move into high school and see the accolades
and big college scholarships go to the people who play the major
sports, the football and basketball and baseball players."</TE>
<TE>   Dallas Cowboy owner Jerry Jones believes this social conditioning
endures from when he played football on the 1964 Arkansas national
championship team.</TE>
<TE>   "They hold ticker-tape parades for war heroes, astronauts and
people who win ballgames," he said. "That's the [culture] we have."</TE>
<TE>   So the traditional sports seem eager to reemphasize their
historical underpinnings.</TE>
<TE>   Howard Schultz, chairman of Starbucks and owner of the Seattle
SuperSonics, reminisces about sitting in the rafters at Madison
Square Garden with his father, cheering for Walt Frazier, Bill
Bradley and the rest of the New York Knicks. The way to get
youngsters, he believes, is to lure families to the arena with
discounts.</TE>
<TE>   The SuperSonics reinforce this notion by having players go into
the stands after games and hand a basketball to a father and son or
mother and daughter. "It links old and new," Schultz said.</TE>
<TE>   Five Minutes</TE>
<TE>   Among the traditional sports, perhaps only boxing faces imminent
danger. "They've got an aging demographic they're not replacing,"
Carter said. With the controversial Mike Tyson and allegations of
fixed rankings, he said, "This generation of kids can see just how
ridiculous it is."</TE>
<TE>   Hockey's future is harder to read: Even as it slid down the ESPN
poll last season, it attracted a surge in young cable viewers. The
rest of the old order figures to hold its ground for a while,
football ruling the roost, basketball and baseball not far behind.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, extreme sports and other forms of entertainment are
expected to siphon away more and more fans.</TE>
<TE>   That would be good news for Arena football.</TE>
<TE>   The league's commissioner is a bull of a man, a former power
forward at UC Irvine, preternaturally optimistic enough to have
overcome past troubles: In a previous incarnation as mayor of Irvine,
he was convicted of misdemeanor check forgery while trying to keep an
underfunded congressional campaign afloat.</TE>
<TE>   Now Baker has reinvented himself as an up-and-comer in the
business of sport. Adaptability, he says, is the key to success.</TE>
<TE>   When his sons and their friends wanted more action on kickoffs, he
succeeded in eliminating the rule that blows a play dead if the
returner steps out of the end zone while catching the ball. Acting on
their suggestion to make extra-point attempts more exciting, he
persuaded the league to experiment with ways to benefit rushers.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at some of the more established sports, they're at
the mature end of their product life," he said. "We're at the
innovative end."</TE>
<TE>   Yet he doesn't want his league compared to a video game and
certainly not to the short-lived XFL. The Arena game is still
football, he said, embodying old-school values and the notion of
overcoming adversity that was critical to his own life. Thus the
nostalgic leanings.</TE>
<TE>   His previous career included a stint at a law firm that
represented Gene Autry, and Baker still has season tickets behind
home plate at Edison Field. A tinge of pride marks his words when he
calls himself "one of those woeful and disillusioned Angel fans."</TE>
<TE>   The problem is, his sons won't go to games with him.</TE>
<TE>   "They think it's too slow and too long," he said. "They come from
a video-game culture where everything has to be slam-bang-hit-boom."</TE>
<TE>   All the marketing research in the world cannot explain this
attitude any better than 19-year-old Benjamin Baker, who says: "If
something doesn't happen in the first five minutes, I'm gone."</TE>

<DH>Pro basketball: Overcoming an ear-splitting din from King
fans, Mavericks win, 110-102, to tie series.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK HEISLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Ask not for whom the cowbell tolls ...</LD>
<LD>   It tolled for the Sacramento Kings Monday night, as the
freewheeling Dallas Mavericks came from 13 points behind in the
second quarter, turned the game into the shootout everyone was hoping
for and won it with guns ablaze, 110-102, evening the series at 1-1.</LD>
<LD>   For the second series in a row, the Kings, No. 1 seeds in the
West, have surrendered their home-court advantage. Unlike the last
one, however, they aren't going on the road to play an old, slow
team, like the Utah Jazz, but the Mavericks, who are at least as deep
and as explosive as they are.</LD>
<TE>   "We know we have to watch out for the quick pace of their
offense," said the Kings' Chris Webber, "but we feel like they have
to watch out for the fast pace of ours.</TE>
<TE>   "But they were successful. You have to give the guys in that
locker room all the credit because it's not easy to come into Arco
Arena and do that."</TE>
<TE>   The Mavericks matched the Kings dunk for dunk, jumper for jumper,
and even tried to get into the cowbell competition, with owner Mark
Cuban incensed at courtside fans who came brandishing the popular
local farm implement, intent on deafening the Dallas traveling party.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant coach Donnie Nelson said his ears were ringing so badly
after Game 1, he had to see a doctor.</TE>
<TE>   Bent on protecting his own, Cuban procured a cowbell and hammered
on it, almost in the ear of a Sacramento writer at the press table,
asking him, "How do you think we feel?"</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, Cuban emerged from the Dallas dressing room,
carrying his cowbell, vowing to pay King Coach Rick Adelman and his
staff back in kind.</TE>
<TE>   "Just wait till we get back to Dallas," said Cuban. "Adelman will
wish he'd never seen a cowbell in his life."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the fans behind the King bench, who began targeting
Laker Coach Phil Jackson and are now directing their reign of terror
at the rest of the league, were warned before the game by an arena
security man about ringing the bells in the Mavericks' ears.</TE>
<TE>   Everything else, of course, was still OK.</TE>
<TE>   "Apparently, we got some people upset last game," said Greg
Ponath, a cowbell-bearing car dealer.</TE>
<TE>   "We've hit the limits. They gave us some ground rules. They said
during the quiet times, they don't want us to ring 'em, but if the
crowd's going nuts, ring away. We're not supposed to step over and
put 'em over their heads."</TE>
<TE>   For the Mavericks, the problem was, the din was going to get
louder before it got quieter.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings shot 70% in the first quarter and led, 40-27, early in
the second, at which time Steve Nash, the Dallas point guard--who'd
had a subpar 12-point Game 1, taking 10 shots and missing seven, and
was supposed to come out much more aggressive in this one--had four
points ... to 15 for the Kings' point guard, Mike Bibby.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, Nash started getting shots to go in, even if he had
to force them, and the Mavericks took off with a whoosh felt
throughout the metropolitan area.</TE>
<TE>   In a span of 1:17, Dallas went 10-0, with Nash hitting a runner, a
three-pointer and a fastbreak layup, and there went the rout. He had
10 of his 30 points in the second quarter. Nick Van Exel, who scored
19 off the bench, had 13 in that period.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to be aggressive and Nick was really on me before the
game," said Nash. "He just kept reminding me and reminding me and
telling me I've got to score, so ... "</TE>
<TE>   Nash would score 26 points to Bibby's seven the rest of the way.
Given the fact the Kings' stars were struggling--Webber shot 10 for
23, Peja Stojakovic five for 19 and Vlade Divac missed most of the
third quarter when his neck stiffened up--Sacramento was fortunate to
stay in the game as long as it did.</TE>
<TE>   "I overplayed [Nash, who went 41 minutes]," Coach Don Nelson said.
"There's no question that we knew this was really an important game
and we had to go after it.</TE>
<TE>   "If you lose the first two, it's not that you can't win the series
but when you think of the odds, they only have to win two remaining
games and you have to win four and there's not many left....</TE>
<TE>   "You live for games like this, competitive and exciting, and gosh,
it sure helps when you win.... The league should be proud of this
game and I'm sure they are."</TE>
<TE>   The series resumes Thursday night in Dallas, where the Kings are
advised to bring their jumpers and earplugs.</TE>

<HD>Absent West Still Fond of His Old Team</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jerry West has gained a new franchise, but hasn't yet lost his
rooting interest.</LD>
<LD>   He watched Sunday's Laker game, among the first without his
affiliation in more than four decades, from Memphis, Tenn.</LD>
<LD>   "It's really not that different," he said Monday night. "I want
them to win. I was a little nervous because they couldn't get
anything going. But, the more you watched the game, you had great
confidence they were going to win. It's great to watch them win.
That's never going to change. I'll pull for them always."</LD>
<TE>   He still likes what he built, and what drives it.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they'll win it all," he said. "They've got two of the
best five players in the league and a coach who knows how to motivate
people. He knows how to get the best out of them. The most remarkable
thing about watching [Phil Jackson] coach is he never looks like he
gets uptight. I don't know what's going on inside, but he's so calm,
and his players reflect that."</TE>
<TE>   West's contract with the Memphis Grizzlies is for $37.5 million
over five years. He also received an ownership stake in the
franchise.</TE>
<TE>   West, who left a $1-million consulting job after 42 years with the
Lakers, is believed to have made a salary of $3 million in his final
years as vice president of basketball operations with the
organization.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant said he awoke every two or three hours Sunday night
and Monday morning so he could measure the pain and the swelling in
his right knee, and ice it, and flex it.</TE>
<TE>   He'll continue the routine until game time tonight, Game 2 of the
Western Conference semifinals against the San Antonio Spurs, the
Lakers' chance to go to Texas with a two-game lead.</TE>
<TE>   By Monday afternoon, Bryant was convinced he would play, even if
it meant altering his game. He was aggressive in Game 1, twice
dunking over Tim Duncan to stir a subdued crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he expected to have full mobility, he said, "Hopefully
I'll be able to move around freely. But, if I can't, I'll make the
necessary adjustments and play around it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal spent substantial minutes guarding Duncan on
Sunday, usually when Malik Rose also was on the floor. In the past,
Jackson has preferred to keep O'Neal away from Duncan because of the
potential for foul trouble.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, however, Jackson said he had no problem with the
matchup. "Shaq felt comfortable guarding Duncan as opposed to chasing
Rose around. If Shaq doesn't get offensive fouls, he's going to be
fine defensively. Shaq usually saves his fouls for the offensive end.
That's where he's got to be careful."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have taken a 1-0 lead in 45 previous best-of-seven
series and have won 40 of them.... The Spurs have never won a
best-of-seven series after losing Game 1, in nine tries.... O'Neal
has 3,056 career points in the playoffs, 32 fewer than Julius Erving,
who is 14th on the all-time list. Michael Jordan, who scored 5,987,
ranks first, followed by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and West.</TE>

<HD>So Far, Hurt So Good for the Lakers</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: O'Neal, Bryant still in pain but expected
to be in lineup tonight when L.A. tries to take 2-0 series lead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We return you now to the adventures of Superman, Spider-Man, Kobe
Bryant and the Super Friends, hurting but up a game in the Western
Conference semifinals, facing their shortest turnaround of the
postseason and against the San Antonio Spurs, who might add a
seven-footer one of these nights.</LD>
<LD>   Suddenly these feel like the playoffs, and the Lakers worked in
earnest Monday morning to mend Shaquille O'Neal and Bryant and their
overall game, which hasn't looked particularly fluid for going on a
couple of weeks now. They play Game 2 tonight at Staples Center,
where Bryant is expected to play on a right knee that will be sore at
best, of little use at the worst.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm definitely going to play," he said. "It's a matter of getting
it under control and trying to treat the pain as much as possible."</LD>
<TE>   Bryant, who suffered a bruise on the inside of his right knee just
below the joint, did not practice Monday and even declined an
invitation by Coach Phil Jackson to shoot some free throws, extended
in part to make light of Bryant's six misses the night before.</TE>
<TE>   "He still didn't find any humor in it," Jackson said. "He was
still in his knee, I think. He wasn't in his head."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, who was wounded twice and required stitches both times
Sunday, once per super alter ego, participated in parts of a light
practice.</TE>
<TE>   He did not address the media and probably won't be happy to hear
he isn't the NBA most valuable player for a second consecutive year.
Various reports had the expected: that O'Neal will finish third,
behind Tim Duncan and Jason Kidd, in that order.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunate that Bruce Bowen's sneaker toe did not land a little
higher, where it would have severely limited his flexibility, Bryant
arrived in El Segundo feeling only moderate pain, and even that
subsided after therapy. He experienced stiffness after sitting for a
short period, however, and avoiding that will be Jackson's focus
tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant has played through various ailments and injuries in the
last several years, often performing his best when apparently
physically limited.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he'll play as well [as usual], probably," Jackson said.
"I think I'll play him longer minutes. He's a mid-40-, early
40-minute player, but I'll probably have to play him longer, just to
watch that he doesn't cool off so much that when he doesn't come back
on the court he's stiff.</TE>
<TE>   "I expect Shaq will be somewhat close to be capable of playing.
Now, whether he reopens the cuts or not, that's something entirely
different. But, he should have enough healing there to have some
feeling back in his finger."</TE>
<TE>   The day on Nash Street was considerably brighter after O'Neal and
Bryant showed up feeling somewhat capable and very optimistic about
Game 2. Jackson, after telling his players he'd never had a playoff
team perform so poorly for a half, had slapstick routines spliced
into Sunday's game film. That would be Shemp playing the knucklehead
after one of the nine first-half turnovers, a cake in the face
somewhere along in their 39% shooting, and, well, that's the general
idea.</TE>
<TE>   "What I did say that was really positive is that they were
competitive, they were tough, their defense was aggressive, they came
up with loose balls," Jackson said. "They were too headstrong for
their own good in the first half. They got it across in the second
half as to how to help themselves out, and how to help the other team
out.</TE>
<TE>   "They tried to do it on their own. Everybody was trying to do it
by themselves rather than playing together in a system ... that
creates shots for each other if they sacrifice themselves in the
offense."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers at times have lost the feel for their triangle offense,
which often has left O'Neal and/or Bryant with the basketball and
time running down. Fortunately for them, they've played enough
defense to hold on and win.</TE>
<TE>   "Our system is almost like a football team," Derek Fisher said.
"If you're running a dive right and the fullback goes left, it messes
up the whole system."</TE>
<TE>   Take Fisher, for example. He missed six three-pointers in eight
attempts in Game 1. Last year, in four games against the Spurs, he
missed five, in 20 attempts. He's not necessarily the one going left,
but when the Lakers talk about flow, they most often are talking
about keeping their supporting cast--Fisher, Rick Fox, Robert Horry,
Brian Shaw--in it.</TE>
<TE>   "The rest of us," Fisher said, "are living off the rhythm our team
has."</TE>
<TE>   It's a funny thing about these Lakers, tough enough again to win
while not at their best. After every postseason game they've
played--three against Portland, one Sunday--the other coach and
players have rued their own poor play and their rotten shooting and
the misfortune of one bounce or another.</TE>
<TE>   Coincidence, maybe. But, maybe they're on that season-opening 16-1
run, where they griped about how badly they were playing while
winning almost every night for six weeks. Then they lost for a while.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," Bryant said. "I don't remember."</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, these playoffs are not going to pass as easily as last
year's, when 15-1 brought the title.</TE>
<TE>   "We really have to forget about last year, what we did last year,"
Bryant said. "This is a new year. It's going to be a new path that we
take to defend our championship. We have to accept that."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charlotte's Jamal Mashburn will not play in Game 2 of the Hornet-Net
series. Jamaal Magloire will, and another big body could make a big
difference for Charlotte.</LD>
<LD>   Magloire will return from a one-game suspension tonight at East
Rutherford, N.J., when Charlotte and New Jersey resume their
second-round series. The Nets lead, 1-0, after winning a game that
showed just how important the backup center position can be.</LD>
<LD>   Net center Todd MacCulloch hurt the Hornets badly in the third
quarter after Elden Campbell went to the bench with his fourth foul.
With Magloire unavailable to step in and defend MacCulloch, New
Jersey's center had an easy time against 6-foot-8 Robert Traylor and
scored 11 points in the quarter.</LD>
<TE>   Mashburn, the team's leading scorer, has not played since Game 1
of the first round against Orlando. He remained in Charlotte on
Monday and will not play in Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   Mashburn has been suffering from anemia, vitamin deficiency and an
inner ear infection.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Amare Stoudemire, considered one of the best high school players

<LD>For all of his success, Andre Agassi has never won the Italian Open.
He did make the final once, in 1989, when Andy Roddick was 6.</LD>
<LD>   Roddick followed Agassi onto center court in the Foro Italico at
Rome on Monday, and both picked up straight-set victories in the
first round of the Tennis Masters Series clay-court event.</LD>
<LD>   The 32-year-old Agassi beat Nicolas Kiefer, 6-3, 6-2, before
Roddick eliminated Alex Calatrava, 6-2, 6-3, in the French Open
tuneup.</LD>
<TE>   No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt also dropped just five games en route to the
next round, eliminating Jonas Bjorkman, 6-2, 6-3.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Juan Carlos Ferrero, Pete Sampras and
three-time French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten play today.</TE>
<TE>   Other winners Monday included 2000 U.S. Open champion Marat Safin,
who beat Alberto Martin, 6-2, 6-2. Carlos Moya, Mark Philippoussis,
Sebastian Grosjean and Ivan Ljubicic also advanced. Greg Rusedski,
15th-seeded Guillermo Canas and 16th-seeded Alex Corretja lost.</TE>

<LD>Patrick Marleau saves his best for the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Marleau scored the tiebreaking goal in the third period at San
Jose, his NHL-leading sixth goal of the postseason, and the Sharks
beat the Colorado Avalanche, 6-4, Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   Marleau beat Colorado goalie Patrick Roy from the left circle with
6:34 left to break a 4-4 tie and give the Sharks 2-1 lead in the
best-of-seven Western Conference semifinal series.</LD>
<TE>   With six goals and four assists, Marleau has at least a point in
each of the Sharks' eight playoff games.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Blake scored two goals for the Avalanche, which had won five
straight in San Jose, dating back to Jan. 25, 2000. Roy turned away
34 San Jose shots.</TE>
<TE>   Owen Nolan scored two goals for the Sharks, including an
empty-netter with 15.5 seconds left, and Evgeni Nabokov, who was
pulled Saturday in San Jose's 8-2 Game 2 loss, stopped 29 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Teemu Selanne tied it for the Sharks with a power-play goal 3:31
into the third period.</TE>
<TE>   The Sharks had a five-on-three advantage early in the period when
Blake and Stephane Yelle were tagged with penalties. Just as Yelle's
holding penalty ended, Selanne hit a perfectly angled shot from the
right side that slid under Roy.</TE>
<TE>   Blake set the tone with a goal just 59 seconds into the game,
rebounding a shot that had Nabokov on the other side of the net.</TE>
<TE>   Blake hadn't practiced Sunday and played only 14 minutes in the
second game--he scored two goals--because of a sore leg. He missed
Game 1.</TE>
<TE>   Shark captain Nolan finally got his first goal of the playoffs
3:20 into the second period. Roy came way out of the net to send the
puck back down the ice, but made a bad clear. Nolan took advantage
with a 45-foot shot that went between Roy's legs.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 3, Toronto 2--Patrick Lalime fell three minutes short of an
NHL record, but it didn't matter because Magnus Arvedson scored twice
to seal the Senators' victory at Ottawa. The pair sparked the
Senators to a 2-1 lead over the Maple Leafs in the best-of-seven
series, which resumes at Ottawa Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Alfredsson had the game-winner for the Senators, who
nervously held off a late surge by the Leafs.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Roberts scored with 3:16 remaining, ending Lalime's bid for
what would have been a record fifth playoff shutout.</TE>
<TE>   Travis Green was credited with Toronto's other goal, banking in a
shot from behind the net off Ottawa's Radek Bonk with 34.5 seconds
remaining to make it 3-2.</TE>
<TE>   Lalime came up with two big saves to preserve the victory,
stopping Tomas Kaberle's point shot and then diving across the crease
to foil Alexander Mogilny's attempt with 12.2 seconds left.</TE>

<KH>Lonnie White ON THE NHL</KH>
<HD>Turning Ducks Around Will Be Mighty Tough</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At least Bryan Murray knew what he was getting himself into last week
when he decided to step down as coach of the Mighty Ducks and take
over as the team's senior vice president of hockey operations and
general manager.</LD>
<LD>   "It's really a big challenge," said Murray, who takes over for
Pierre Gauthier, the same man who hired him as a coach less than a
year ago. "We're going to have to do a good job of selling the fact
that we are going to be a very serious playoff contender."</LD>
<LD>   The Ducks and the playoffs?</LD>
<TE>   That's something that has happened only twice in the franchise's
nine-year history and the key reason why Gauthier was fired April 19
after Anaheim was left out of postseason play for the third
consecutive season.</TE>
<TE>   But turning a losing franchise into a winner is something Murray
has done before and that's why the Ducks never talked to any other
candidates, including former New York Ranger general manager Neil
Smith, before giving him the job.</TE>
<TE>   "With 30 teams and everyone knowing the players on each team, it's
a little harder than it used to be when you try and make the trade
that you want," the 59-year-old Murray said. "But I've taken over
non-playoff teams before and I think that experience will help me."</TE>
<TE>   Murray served as vice president and general manager for Florida
from 1994 to 2001, and helped turn the Panthers into a Stanley Cup
contending team that reached the finals in their third year of
existence. Murray also worked as general manager for Detroit from
1990-94.</TE>
<TE>   With the Panthers and Red Wings, Murray eventually combined
general manager duties and coaching. He said it wouldn't have been
fair for him to try to do both jobs with the Ducks, which is why his
top priority is finding a coach as soon as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been taking a lot of hockey calls and talking to a lot of
people already," Murray said from his home in Florida Monday
afternoon. "I will not interview 20 people for the job. I hope to get
the final list to three or four candidates before making a decision."</TE>
<TE>   Former Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock and former Buffalo coach Ted
Nolan are possible candidates, but Murray could turn his focus to
King assistant Dave Tippett, who interviewed for the Duck job last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Tippett's stock is on the rise after he helped lead the Kings to
the league's best power play during the regular season. Tippett, who
did a good job filling in for an injured Andy Murray after the
Olympic break, also has head coaching experience, having led Houston
to the International Hockey League title in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   One coach who will not be a candidate is Murray's brother, Terry,
who led the Philadelphia Flyers to the finals in 1997 and worked
under Murray with the Panthers. Which was not a great experience for
either.</TE>
<TE>   "Terry's an excellent coach with a great track record, but we
learned from our experience in Florida," Bryan Murray said. "I don't
think it would be fair for either one of us to have that happen
again.... When we got right down to it, it was a real negative."</TE>
<TE>   Although Murray hasn't ruled out a major player overhaul this
summer, he believes the Ducks have a strong core to work with. That's
a good thing because Murray doesn't expect the league's top free
agents to give the Ducks a legitimate look during the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   "Realistically, we will have a hard time this summer getting the
high-profile free agent to sign with us," Murray said about the
Ducks, who finished last in attendance this season and have had three
general managers and five coaches in nine years. "The majority of
them believe it is important to play for a team that they consider a
legitimate Stanley Cup contender, besides making money.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest issue will be addressing our power play [which
finished 30th in the league] and that does not necessarily mean
adding just one player.... I think having Disney behind the Ducks is
a real plus, but the hockey side will have to step up and convince
some of these players who might be available that we have a core of
people in place that give us a chance to win on a regular basis....</TE>
<TE>   "We just have to step up and do what we have to do.... Maybe we
haven't done it in the past, but we have to now."</TE>
<TE>   Dream Matchup</TE>
<TE>   NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman has to be rooting for a Stanley Cup
final four featuring Toronto versus Montreal in the East and Colorado
versus Detroit in the West because the NHL would definitely take a
hit by having a St. Louis versus Carolina final.</TE>
<TE>   With the league's popularity seemingly on the rise, based on the
increased attendance numbers of the playoffs, Bettman would love to
have interesting finals in both conferences.</TE>
<TE>   The NHL would have all of Canada glued to a Toronto-Montreal
series. The matchup not only would guarantee Bettman of having an
original six team in the finals but also a Canadian franchise for the
first time since Vancouver lost to the New York Rangers in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   The NHL could not lose with either team playing for the Cup. If
Toronto reached the finals, it would be the Maple Leafs' first
appearance since 1967. An appearance by Montreal, which last played
for the league title in 1993, would end the Canadiens' longest
Stanley Cup finals drought since a 12-season absence that ended in
1944.</TE>
<TE>   A Colorado-Detroit matchup in the Western Conference finals would
pit the defending Stanley Cup champion Avalanche, which would be
looking to become the third team to repeat since 1988, against the
Red Wings, who feature an all-star cast and league's best
regular-season record.</TE>
<TE>   If Detroit advanced into the finals and faced either Toronto or
Montreal, it would be the first matchup of original six teams since
1979, when Montreal defeated the Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   Double Standards?</TE>
<TE>   You can easily understand Carolina's frustration with the league
when the Hurricanes had to play Game 2 of their conference semifinal
series against Montreal without forward Jeff O'Neill, who was
suspended by Colin Campbell, the NHL's vice president of hockey
operations, for his Game 1 hit on Canadien defenseman Sheldon Souray.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill may have deserved punishment for his hit, but you have to
question whether his was any worse than the ones thrown by the Maple
Leafs' Gary Roberts and Darcy Tucker in their first-round series
against the New York Islanders.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts knocked New York defenseman Kenny Jonsson out of the
playoffs when he hit him from behind and sent him crashing into the
boards. Tucker ended Islander captain Michael Peca's season when he
low-bridged him and tore Peca's knee to shreds.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Roberts nor Tucker was punished by the league even though
Jonsson and Peca were seriously injured. But O'Neill sat while Souray
played in Montreal's Game 2 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina General Manager Jim Rutherford was not pleased.</TE>
<TE>   "It was early in the game, and for all intents and purposes
[O'Neill] missed [all of Game 1]," Rutherford said. "The league is
trying to protect players along the boards, but I do not think it
warranted a suspension."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Montreal's Richard Zednik continued to recover from a severe
concussion he sustained in Game 4 of the first round against the
Boston Bruins and is hopeful of returning to the lineup soon, perhaps
by the end of the Eastern Conference semifinal series against the
Carolina Hurricanes.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm feeling better every day," said Zednik, who in addition to
the concussion sustained a bruised throat and facial injuries when
struck by the elbow of Bruin defenseman Kyle McLaren.</LD>
<LD>   Zednik will be examined later in the week and can begin skating
again if he shows no symptoms from his injuries. That means he could
be ready if the series with Carolina goes the limit.</LD>
<TE>   Zednik led the Canadiens with four goals and four assists before
being hurt.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Odgers, who led the Atlanta Thrashers in penalty minutes this
season despite missing nearly half the games, re-signed with the team
for one year. Terms were not disclosed. The 32-year-old veteran
forward had been an unrestricted free agent. Odgers had four goals,
four assists and 135 penalty minutes for the Thrashers this season.
He missed 36 games with a broken leg.... St. Louis Blue forward Ray
Ferraro is questionable, with an undisclosed injury, for tonight's
Game 3 of their Western Conference semifinal series against Detroit.</TE>

<LD>Randy Johnson went back to work Monday night and lost for the first
time this season--on an unearned run.</LD>
<LD>   Second baseman Junior Spivey overthrew first base in an
ill-advised attempt to turn a double play in the seventh inning,
allowing Jason Kendall to score the go-ahead run in Pittsburgh's 3-2
victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks at Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   Kendall was three for four with a run-scoring double and Brian
Giles, one for 17 against Johnson entering the game, homered in the
first inning for the Pirates. Pittsburgh won for only the second time
in eight games and stopped Arizona's four-game winning streak.</LD>
<TE>   A lower back strain caused Johnson to miss his first start in
nearly two years last Wednesday. He wasn't at his best in his return
to the mound, although he grew stronger as the night went on.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson (6-1) struck out eight and walked none, scattering six
hits in seven innings. His last regular-season loss was Aug. 23 at
Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Josh Fogg (4-1) matched Johnson's performance before being lifted
for a pinch-hitter in the seventh. The Pirate rookie gave up two runs
and six hits in six innings. He struck out three, walked one
intentionally and hit a batter.</TE>
<TE>   Reliever Scott Sauerbeck shut down Arizona for two innings, and
Mike Williams pitched the ninth for his 12th save.</TE>
<TE>   With two out in the Arizona ninth, Craig Counsell turned what
appeared to be a routine single into a double with hustle and a
headfirst slide. After pinch-hitter Chris Donnels walked, Tony Womack
grounded out to end it.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 8, Milwaukee 5--Adam Dunn hit his first grand slam,
finished with five RBIs, and the Reds overcame starter Joey
Hamilton's hamstring injury to win at Cincinnati. Sean Casey hit
three doubles and a single as the Reds emerged from a scoring slump
and a four-game losing streak. Cincinnati had only six runs in its
last 35 innings. Hamilton pulled his left hamstring while covering
first base in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 6, St. Louis 5--Alex Gonzalez hit a solo home run with one
out in the bottom of the ninth and Bill Mueller homered in his first
game back from the disabled list to lead the Cubs at Chicago.</TE>

<LD>Taylor Wood, a USC-bound senior, shot four-under-par 68 to lead Santa
Margarita to the Southern Section Southern Divisional title Monday at
Los Serranos Golf Club in Chino Hills.</LD>
<LD>   Steve Harward shot 73 and twins Jeff and Steve Bullock had
matching 74s for the Eagles, ranked No. 3 by The Times, but the real
surprise was Long Beach Poly, which shot 377 and finished second. The
top two teams advance to the section finals Thursday at La Purisima
Golf Course in Lompoc.</LD>
<LD>   Poly's golf team is the only team at the school that has not won a
league or section title in the last 22 years. The Jackrabbits had not
beaten rival Long Beach Wilson since 1999, but, led by a 69 from
senior Jeffrey Hastings Monday, finished four shots ahead of the
Bruins for a berth in the section finals. Wilson is ranked No. 2 by
The Times.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a good start," said Wood, who had three birdies and an
eagle. "But we can go lower."</TE>

<TE>   In baseball:</TE>
<TE>   Woodland Hills El Camino Real 4, Chatsworth 3--Jeremy Boyle's
bases-loaded single in the bottom of the seventh gave the No. 10
Conquistadores (22-4, 10-1 in league) a West Valley League victory.</TE>
<TE>   Jesse Michel gave El Camino Real an early lead with a two-run home
run. Chatsworth (22-4, 7-4), ranked No. 11, took a 3-2 lead in the
sixth on consecutive home runs by Brian Lee and Jordan Sisson. The
Conquistadores tied the score on an RBI single by Christian Hariot in
their half of the inning. Joe Guntz (7-2) lost for only the second
time in his high school career.</TE>
<TE>   With two games left, El Camino Real has a one-game lead over No.
12 Birmingham (22-3, 8-2), which defeated Granada Hills, 8-3, as Raul
Campos (8-0) threw a complete game and hit a solo home run.</TE>

Coach Tim Mang said, and will be ineligible to compete for the

<HD>Bringing NFL Back to L.A. Is a Lose-Lose Proposition</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The next year or so should be a lot of fun, with the good citizens of
Los Angeles and San Diego meeting in a match race to see who will
emerge as the more miserable.</LD>
<LD>   They're just entering the starting gate, but San Diego has a
considerable advantage because it has already sat across the
negotiating table from Alex and Dean Spanos, the Donald Sterling-like
owners of the Chargers, and has been ripped off.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   SAN DIEGO will emerge more miserable if it loses its team, because
that will mean the big city up the road got it, and the small-town
citizens will hang their heads, believing everyone around the country
will think less of San Diego for not having an NFL team.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles will emerge more miserable if it gets the team, which
means it will have endured the exhausting, frustrating process of
pleasing the Spanos Goofs and the Anschutz Empire at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, there will be some satisfaction knowing the
Chargers and the Anschutz Empire will also be miserable--haggling
with each other.</TE>
<TE>   The Anschutz Empire has already made a number of changes to a plan
for a sports complex at Cal State Dominguez Hills so it can
accommodate a new training camp for the Chargers.</TE>
<TE>   But now the Chargers want to sign only a one-year lease beginning
next summer, unless they are assured a hotel will be built nearby to
house their players. They get that, and the Chargers will demand
mints on every pillow every night.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AS YOU know, there's talk of building a new playpen for a football
team in Los Angeles and filling it with a crummy team that is
essentially unloved elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   That would be the Chargers, who have gone 23-57 over the last five
years. They have won six games, total, the last two seasons and at
quarterback have Tom Thumb, who is hard to see from the upper deck of
Qualcomm Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego guaranteed Charger sellouts when the team insisted on a
renovated stadium, so the city has had to dip into the general tax
fund to buy millions of dollars' worth of unsold tickets. This has
generated tremendous animosity in the community.</TE>
<TE>   Now the Chargers are turning their back on San Diego. They ushered
the media out of their office space, because who needs good press
when the city guarantees sellouts.</TE>
<TE>   The team's general manager doesn't return phone calls to the beat
reporter of the city's biggest paper, which makes him a Mike Garrett
copycat.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers close practices, I presume because the guys just lie
around and do nothing. That would explain how this team has lost five
consecutive games in each of the last five seasons. That's hard to do
in this age of NFL parity. And these guys could be all ours in a
couple of years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE SPANOS Goofs have an escape clause in their rip-off deal with
San Diego to leave after 2003 if they can persuade another city of
dummies to make them richer. It doesn't appear that L.A. qualifies as
a city of dummies just now, but history is on the Chargers' side,
because every city that has lost an NFL team eventually goes stir
crazy and surrenders everything to get one back.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, it was Alex Spanos who said, after L.A. had lost pro
football, that all the NFL had to do was wait 10 years, and like
Baltimore and St. Louis, who had said good riddance, only to come
back and do whatever the NFL wanted, L.A. would come begging.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. will shortly begin season No. 8 without the NFL, and soon a
budding group of beggars, led by Anschutz Empire point man Tim
Leiweke, will go to New York to curry NFL favor. I believe Michael
Ovitz made 23 of those trips the last time around.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL is very good at welcoming all suckers and making them feel
as if they are just a blown-up football away from having a team.</TE>
<TE>   That's how they get you hooked before talks begin to drive up the
price. By the time Houston's Bob McNair bid on an expansion
franchise, the NFL had him overpaying by more than $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW YOU might have read in the newspaper last week that Leiweke
said we could have a team by 2003, which made it clear Leiweke has no
idea what he's talking about. The Chargers aren't available until
after 2003, and only if they satisfy a list of items allowing them
out of their lease, and only if the city of San Diego decides not to
match any offer made to the team to move.</TE>
<TE>   This is why you have to understand that Leiweke's greatest
strengths are Anschutz's wealth, Anschutz's unwillingness to speak
and Leiweke's own naivete.</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz can get the NFL's attention, but how far will he go with
Leiweke? Leiweke has no worry about being second-guessed, because
Anschutz runs from the media.</TE>
<TE>   We do know, however, he has yet to approve the plan to go after a
team, right now allowing Leiweke to pursue the idea only to see how
far he can get.</TE>
<TE>   He did the same thing with Ed Roski six years ago, telling Roski
he didn't think Roski could bring football to L.A., but in repayment
for Roski's making the Staples Center deal happen downtown when
Anschutz didn't think it would, he lent his name to the project. A
short time later, he pulled out.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke, meanwhile, thinks he can walk on water these days. That's
frozen water, of course, because he's the Kings' president, and there
might be a message there about missed expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke expects to announce soon that he has a team and will be
building a football stadium; he also expected to make that
announcement while the Kings were playing in the Stanley Cup finals.</TE>
<TE>   As a spectator, of course, I don't want to see Leiweke scratched
before the race begins, because I think it would be fun to have Shaq
and Tom Thumb playing in the same town.</TE>

<HD>Romario Not on World Cup Team</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brazil Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari ignored intense public pressure,
including some advice from President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, and
left 1994 World Cup winner Romario off the 23-player roster he named
Monday for Korea/Japan '02.</LD>
<LD>   The decision to omit the 36-year-old Vasco Da Gama striker is
likely to cause a furor that will abate only if Brazil wins the World
Cup.</LD>
<LD>   Otherwise, Scolari probably will pay with his job. Romario has
been the top goal scorer in Brazil for the last two seasons.</LD>
<TE>   As recently as Saturday, Scolari was sworn at and shoved by angry
fans outside the Brazilian soccer federation's headquarters in Rio de
Janeiro for continually leaving Romario off the national team for
what he claimed were "tactical and technical" reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Former coach Mario Zagallo bumped a then slightly injured Romario
off his team on the eve of the 1998 World Cup and was fired after
Brazil lost to France in the final. Similarly, former coach Wanderley
Luxemburgo refused to take Romario to the Sydney 2000 Olympics and
was ousted from his position after Brazil lost to eventual gold
medalist Cameroon in the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   The only other notable player left off Brazil's roster was
Djalminha, who did his cause little good last week when he
head-butted Javier Irureta, his coach at the Spanish club Deportivo
La Coruna.</TE>
<TE>   Scolari selected 11 European-based players and 12 who play in the
Brazilian league. Included in the team are the trio of Ronaldo,
Rivaldo and Ronaldinho, who are likely to comprise Brazil's attack.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil plays Turkey, China and Costa Rica in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Argentina Coach Marcelo Bielsa set up a potential confrontation
with Japanese immigration officials Monday when he included forward
Claudio Caniggia among the dozen players he said would definitely
make his World Cup roster.</TE>
<TE>   Caniggia, who injured knee ligaments Saturday while helping the
Rangers win the Scottish Cup final, was suspended for more than a
year by FIFA in 1993 for cocaine use. Japanese law forbids entry into
the country of those involved in drug use, which is why Caniggia's
former Argentina teammate, Diego Maradona, has consistently been
denied entry.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ecuador's World Cup team flew to the United States on Monday for
two warm-up games this week, against Yugoslavia on Wednesday at East
Rutherford, N.J., and against AC Milan on Saturday at New Haven,
Conn.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Dario Gomez's squad then travels to Spain for a game against
Atletico Madrid before continuing on to Japan, where it plays Italy,
Mexico and Croatia in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   Europe</TE>
<TE>   Germany Coach Rudi Voeller also named his roster Monday and caused
a surprise by selecting Carsten Jancker as one of his forwards
instead of Martin Max. Jancker, who plays for Bayern Munich, failed
to score a goal in the Bundesliga season that ended Saturday, while
Max, from TSV 1860 Munich, scored 18.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a body blow," Max said. "I don't really know what the
world has come to."</TE>
<TE>   Apart from defender Christian Ziege and midfielder Dietmar Hamann,
who play in England, and forward Oliver Bierhoff, who plays in
France, Voeller's entire roster is drawn from Bundesliga clubs.</TE>
<TE>   Voeller decided to take a chance and include talented midfielder
Sebastien Deisler, even though the 22-year-old Hertha Berlin but
soon-to-be Bayern Munich player had knee surgery in October, suffered
a groin injury in April and is not fully fit.</TE>
<TE>   The veteran squad, with eight of the players 30 or older, meets
Saudi Arabia, Ireland and Cameroon in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Spain became the latest country to lose one of its leading players
Monday when veteran defender Sergi was ruled out of the World Cup
after injuring his left ankle while playing for Barcelona last week.
He will undergo surgery today.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The club future of U.S. defender David Regis was cast into doubt
Monday when FC Metz fired Coach Gilbert Gress after the former
Switzerland national team coach had failed to help the French club
from being relegated to the second division.</TE>
<TE>   Asia</TE>
<TE>   South Korea, the U.S. team's second opponent at the World Cup, has
started final preparations by putting its players under armed guard
on the resort island of Jeju and also cutting off their access to
hotel telephones.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Guus Hiddink said the moves were intended to shield the
players from the increasing pressure of fans and the media.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Japanese police are investigating why the grass at Russia's
intended training site in Shimizu has turned yellow and died. World
Cup organizers said it appeared someone had overdosed the field with
pesticides. They promised to sow new grass and hoped that it would be
ready for the Russian team's May 26 arrival.</TE>
<TE>   Russia plays in the same first-round group as Japan, along with
Belgium and Tunisia.</TE>

<LD>For more than a year, Stephanie Varlotta tried to convince
administrators at Los Angeles University High that something was
seriously wrong with the Warrior softball program.</LD>
<LD>   Just weeks before the season was to start, there was no coach. The
pitching rubber was broken. The field was a health hazard, with
patches of grass growing in the all-dirt infield. There was no summer
program, not even an off-season class to teach fundamentals.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not fighting for anything exuberant or extravagant," said
Varlotta, a tenacious senior who pitches and plays infield for the
University softball team. "I just want our field to look like the
baseball field."</LD>
<TE>   Varlotta complained to the athletic director, the assistant
principal and the Los Angeles Unified School District's local
superintendent's office. She made repeated phone calls to maintenance
operations.</TE>
<TE>   No one took action. Finally, she had had enough.</TE>
<TE>   "I was fed up," Varlotta said. "Four coaches in four years, we
don't have dugouts, we've had a girl sprain her ankle because the
field is so bad. It was excuse after excuse."</TE>
<TE>   So, in January, she filed a Title IX complaint with the LAUSD
office of Educational Equity Compliance, which monitors and enforces
federal and state discrimination laws within the district. Varlotta
alleged that University was not providing equal athletic
opportunities for members of both sexes.</TE>
<TE>   Varlotta pointed out that the baseball team has a field that's
reseeded each year, has a scoreboard, dugouts and batting cage, a
summer program, an off-season baseball class and a stable coaching
staff.</TE>
<TE>   The problems aren't unique to University. Two other LAUSD schools
are facing similar mandates to correct inequities after Title IX
complaints. Woodland Hills Taft is building a softball diamond
adjacent to its baseball field, so it won't have to play its home
games at a park. Granada Hills Kennedy is scheduled to build a
softball field after its new gymnasium is completed this year.</TE>
<TE>   Those improvements are coming about because coaches intervened and
filed complaints.</TE>
<TE>   What is unique about University's situation is that it came to
light because of the courage of an 18-year-old student.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very simple idea," Varlotta said. "The boys get new grass,
the girls get new grass; the boys have dugouts, the girls have
dugouts."</TE>
<TE>   Varlotta documented her equity complaint so thoroughly, complete
with photos, that within days administrators started to pay
attention.</TE>
<TE>   "I was summoned by the principal, who was shocked I didn't go to
her first," Varlotta said.</TE>
<TE>   Varlotta recalled three times trying to meet Principal Cynthia Ann
Petty, only to be passed on to the assistant principal.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin O'Connell, specialist in the Educational Equity section,
conducted an investigation and determined that University was in
violation of LAUSD equity policy.</TE>
<TE>   By spring break, new dugouts were built on the softball diamond,
complete with wood roofs and enclosed fencing. A new pitching rubber
was put in.</TE>
<TE>   On April 17, Varlotta signed a compliance agreement, accepting the
school's commitment to make major changes to upgrade the softball
program. Among the changes:</TE>
<TE>   * A softball fundamentals class will be offered next year.</TE>
<TE>   * A softball coach must be hired no later than Oct. 31.</TE>
<TE>   * The school must close the softball field so that it can be
graded, reseeded and comparable to the field used by the baseball
program.</TE>
<TE>   * The school must allocate the burden of field damage between
softball and baseball.</TE>
<TE>   * The school must develop a plan to purchase and install a
scoreboard for the softball team.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to Varlotta, O'Connell concluded, "Because of your
tremendous determination and sense of fairness, girls in your school
and within your district who currently participate, or who someday
will participate in a softball program, shall benefit."</TE>
<TE>   All Varlotta wanted was as much chance to succeed in softball as
the boys have in baseball.</TE>
<TE>   She's the senior class president. She played youth baseball
growing up. Her boyfriend is former All-City pitcher Ethan Katz. She
never tried to ruin the baseball program to save softball.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm proud of her," Katz said. "Someone had to do it. She's
hard-nosed, demanding and isn't going to give up easily. She wasn't
going to stop no matter how far she had to go up the ladder to get
this done."</TE>
<TE>   Ray Blum, athletic director at University, said finding a coach
for softball "is difficult." He said the failure to build dugouts in
a timely manner was because of district bureaucracy. He said the
reason baseball has more amenities for its field than softball is
fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   But Deanne Neiman, director of the Educational Equity section,
said there were plenty of opportunities for the school to intervene
and correct the inequities.</TE>
<TE>   "The school could have pursued this had they paid attention and
taken it seriously," she said.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell can think of a good way to recognize Varlotta's
contributions to the school and the girls' sports program. "I think
they should name the field after her," he said. "She's a senior and
knows she's not going to benefit from this compliance plan, but she
knows other girls are going to come along and benefit."</TE>
<TE>   Varlotta is simply grateful that the system worked.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope other schools will follow suit," she said. "I've never
seen administrators turn around so quickly. It made me so happy and
so proud. I can't wait to come back next year and see a scoreboard
and green grass growing."</TE>

<KH>SPUR NOTES</KH>
<HD>Duncan May End Up With First MVP</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Stephens</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tim Duncan is expected to be named the NBA's most valuable player for
the first time, an honor that is bittersweet in this playoff season.</LD>
<LD>   The official announcement is expected to come Thursday at a news
conference in San Antonio, according to several reports. Duncan will
be honored before Game 3 Friday at the Alamodome.</LD>
<LD>   Duncan's father, William, died early last week after a long
illness.</LD>
<TE>   Duncan reportedly beat out New Jersey Net guard Jason Kidd in
balloting among 126 media members in the U.S. and Canada, and
Shaquille O'Neal was third.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, Duncan is downplaying the talk.</TE>
<TE>   "It'd be great if it does happen," he said. "Honestly, that's not
important right now. The important thing is the game tomorrow and
trying to win that one. The whole MVP thing, it's going to take care
of itself."</TE>
<TE>   Duncan posted career-highs in scoring (25.5 points) and rebounding
(12.7), which ranked fifth and second in the league. He was third in
blocked shots and averaged nearly four assists.</TE>
<TE>   Guard Terry Porter said Duncan deserves the award.</TE>
<TE>   "It will surprise me if he wins because everybody's been kind of
giving it to Jason Kidd," Porter said. "I think he should get it."</TE>
<TE>   Porter had a different take on Duncan's value to the team.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of guys were joking after the game at Seattle that we
earned him the MVP," he said, referring to the Spurs' 91-79 Game 4
loss, which the forward missed to attend his father's funeral. "I
don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Spur Coach Gregg Popovich said that a realistic return for David
Robinson would be Friday. An appearance in Game 2 today was unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   "He is making progress," Popovich said after Monday's practice at
the Staples Center. "We're a lot more hopeful for Friday. He's
getting close."</TE>
<TE>   Robinson, who has played in only one of the Spurs' six playoff
games, tried to practice, but pain in his right ankle has affected
his mobility. The ankle pain is a result of a herniated disk in his
lower back.</TE>
<TE>   "He was able to do a little scrimmage," Popovich said. "Again, it
got to the point where it kind of stopped working for him. That nerve
has been tough in getting it healed."</TE>
<TE>   Guard Antonio Daniels said the Spurs can function without their
center.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't control whether Dave is on the floor or whether he's not
on the floor," Daniels said. "Obviously, if he is on the floor, we're
a much better ball club."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Duncan certainly didn't have an MVP performance in Game 1, when he
missed his first 10 shots and 21 of 30.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to shoot the ball better," he said. "I have to make better
decisions out of double-teams."</TE>
<TE>   Simply put, San Antonio can't afford another 31.8% performance
from the field.</TE>
<TE>   "You need to shoot better than 32 [percent] to beat the Lakers
probably," Popovich said. "That'd be a good bet."</TE>

<LD>Where have all the adults gone?</LD>
<LD>   Maybe it all had to do with hearing about the exploits of one
teenager who made quite an impact in Monte Carlo last month. Or the
combination of hearing about that kid, and another teenager causing a
stir in Mallorca, Spain, last week.</LD>
<LD>   Each of these two youngsters is 15 years old. Now, 15 years old is
hardly shocking on the women's tour.</LD>
<TE>   But on the ATP Tour? Fifteen-year-old Richard Gasquet of France
beat Franco Squillari of Argentina in the first round at Monte Carlo
before losing to Marat Safin in the second and was recently awarded a
wild card into the French Open. The second youngster is Rafael
Nadal-Parera of Spain, who defeated Ramon Delgado of Paraguay in the
first round at Mallorca, then lost to Olivier Rochus of Belgium in
the second.</TE>
<TE>   Enough was enough.</TE>
<TE>   It was time to talk to Rick Leach, that noted doubles player.</TE>
<TE>   Considering all those on the tour who were born in the '80s,
there's a certain comfort in seeing a birth date in which the third
digit is a six, as in 1964. Not quite as satisfying as getting carded
at a club ... but close.</TE>
<TE>   Leach, refreshingly, is an adult. He returns phone calls, not only
the same day but usually within hours. He has a good sense of humor
about his (relatively) advanced age on the tour. He will turn 38 in
November and last year became the oldest player to win an ATP doubles
title since Sherwood Stewart, who won at 40 in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   This week, Leach is playing with Brian MacPhie at the Italian Open
in Rome because his regular partner, Ellis Ferreira is suffering from
nerve problems in his shoulder. MacPhie turns 30 on May 11, which,
compared to Leach, makes him practically a kid.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, Leach has taken his share of hits in the locker room,
but wide as the generation gap is, he isn't ready to quit playing and
become a coach, not even after his father, Dick, announced he was
going to retire as USC coach in June. After all, he won three
tournaments last year, earning $236,872, and reached the
quarterfinals at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open.</TE>
<TE>   Still ...</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so old, compared to these guys," Leach said. "The worst was
at the Australian Open. They say I'm going to keep playing on the
tour till I go straight into the 45s, and skip the 35s."</TE>
<TE>   Success, of course, helps him maintain a healthy perspective. But
he still sometimes has to put up with things others don't at
tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   At Monte Carlo, for instance, tournament workers didn't believe he
was a player and didn't want to give him a locker at first.</TE>
<TE>   What does he have to do? Carry around a resume?</TE>
<TE>   That would be a handful. Leach won his first Australian Open title
in 1988, his second in 1989 and his third in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The first two were with Jim Pugh and the third was with Ferreira.
In 1988, Leach and Pugh beat Jeremy Bates and Peter Lundgren, then
Darren Cahill and Mark Kratzmann in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Some perspective: In 2002, Cahill is coaching Andre Agassi, and
Lundgren has been working with Roger Federer.</TE>
<TE>   Leach, though, isn't the only thirty-something still finding
success on the doubles tour. Jeff Tarango is 33, and will turn 34 in
November. He won his 14th doubles title last year, with Australian
Michael Hill, and made five other finals.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as 1999, Tarango lost in the singles final of one
tournament and reached the semifinals in another. The next year he
represented the United States at the Olympics in Sydney, playing
singles.</TE>
<TE>   The best example of the latest doubles bloomer is Don Johnson, who
will turn 34 in September. He had his best season in 2001, leading
the circuit with seven titles, among them Wimbledon's, reached three
other finals, and also made his U.S. Davis Cup debut.</TE>
<TE>   Summer Swing</TE>
<TE>   Tickets will go on sale Monday for the JP Morgan Chase Open, Aug.
4-11, at Manhattan Country Club in Manhattan Beach, and the field
appears slightly stronger than last year's. Among those committed to
play are defending champion Lindsay Davenport, two-time champion
Serena Williams, Martina Hingis and Jennifer Capriati, who will be
appearing for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   The final two days of the event will be shown on ESPN. One
semifinal, the first, will be tape-delayed Aug. 10, and the final
will be on live Aug. 11, starting at 11:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Capriati also has entered the Acura Classic at Carlsbad, the week
before the Manhattan Beach tournament. This year's tournament will be
televised live on ABC on Aug. 4.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>David Robinson still feels pain. And this has nothing to do with his
lower back.</LD>
<LD>   This pain lingers from 1995, when his highest career achievement
preceded one of his lowest. Then, before Game 1 of the Western
Conference finals, Commissioner David Stern awarded Robinson the most
valuable player trophy.</LD>
<LD>   Hakeem Olajuwon promptly slugged Robinson with it.</LD>
<TE>   Another Spur now waits for his own trophy, with his own rival
poised to slug.</TE>
<TE>   The one who can stop the same from happening?</TE>
<TE>   The one who lived it before.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson.</TE>
<TE>   That's where Robinson's other pain comes into play. He has what
they call a "floating particle" in his back, and that never sounds
good.</TE>
<TE>   Seven years ago there wasn't a credible runner-up to Robinson.
Olajuwon was coming off an MVP season the year before, but he missed
a chunk of that season because of injuries. The Rockets finished as
the sixth seed, and rarely are trophies given for that.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the award presentation in the Alamodome, where Duncan's
presentation likely will be before Game 3. Mario Elie, then in the
Rockets' locker room, later told what happened.</TE>
<TE>   Olajuwon saw Stern and Robinson and the celebration, then turned
to no one in particular. "That man has my trophy," growled Olajuwon.</TE>
<TE>   Olajuwon followed with an athletic zenith. He spun Robinson,
tossed out the Dream Shake and won the series.</TE>
<TE>   "Who's the MVP now!" Clyde Drexler crowed in the aftermath.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson said he put the trophy in a closet and had a hard time
looking at it.</TE>
<TE>   "I had trouble enjoying [the MVP award] at all," Robinson said.
"You know, that trophy still has bad memories."</TE>
<TE>   It was supposed to represent success. It haunted instead.</TE>
<TE>   So does Duncan face the same now with Shaquille O'Neal?</TE>
<TE>   Robinson smiled. "No. I can see us beating the Lakers."</TE>
<TE>   And if that doesn't happen?</TE>
<TE>   "People know Tim deserves it. He's clearly the best."</TE>
<TE>   Robinson says Duncan still held his own Sunday, and the numbers
back that up. Duncan missed 21 of 30 shots, all right, but still
ended with 21 rebounds, four blocks and five assists.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that's another sign of the MVP. Even when he's off, he's
effective.</TE>
<TE>   But Robinson has another point, and this one was on his side too,
in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "Look who Shaq has around him," said Robinson.</TE>
<TE>   Olajuwon had Drexler. O'Neal has Kobe Bryant, another top-five MVP
candidate. The second-best Spur, in contrast, is arguably Tony
Parker, a 19-year-old in his first playoff season.</TE>
<TE>   But what if Robinson's floating particle floats into place
tonight? What if Robinson can give 25 minutes of defense on O'Neal,
and the Spurs even the series?</TE>
<TE>   And what happens if Duncan receives his award Friday, and he's
then joined in the starting lineup by a former MVP?</TE>
<TE>   A series changes. As does the perception of a trophy.</TE>

<HD>Artist Designs a Guardian Angel of Her Own</HD>
<DH>Statue: As many as 200 of the works will soon be set up.
Michelle Allen's butterfly-covered depiction has already lifted her
spirits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA RIVERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Art, insists Michelle Allen, has often provided relief from the
steely grip of her hard life.</LD>
<LD>   But it was persistence that recently propelled her cumbersome
wheelchair onto an elevator at the 7th and Figueroa shopping plaza
downtown, outmaneuvering several rude pedestrians who would have
crowded in front of her. She had wandered over from her apartment a
few blocks--and a world--away on skid row to explore and grab a meal,
but may instead have met her guardian angel.</LD>
<LD>   It was pearly white and unadorned, standing 6 feet, 6 inches in
the showroom of Community of Angels, the public art program that
began last year and features decorated life-size angel statues set
out in public and private places across Los Angeles. Allen happened
on the storefront the day before the deadline for this year's design
submissions.</LD>
<TE>   She worked through the night to come up with a sketch of
butterflies to cover an angel's fiberglass body. It was presented the
next day and accepted.</TE>
<TE>   She was more delighted to learn that the angel project benefits
youth programs of the Volunteers of America.</TE>
<TE>   Allen is staying in a single room apartment operated by the same
group on skid row. She is 45, afflicted with a degenerative joint
disease and dependent on disability checks for most of her income.
Off and on for three years she has been homeless, living in a rented
car and on the street.</TE>
<TE>   She has shown her colorful portrayals of mothers and children,
animals, African, Latin and Asian studies at craft fairs and
charitable events, but the returns have been too small to do more
than ease the financial strain for a time, never enough to make a
real difference.</TE>
<TE>   She will get $1,000 for the angel statue. But more important, she
hopes that this art project will be a means to mend her tattered
life; that the angel taking on the hues of exotic butterflies will
transport her to a better place. She is mindful of the formidable
odds.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like trying to find the energy to one more time pick
yourself up, and it's hard," said Allen, sitting at a desk in the
Community of Angels store. She referred to her home of three months
only a few blocks away, a gated residential community called
Ballington Plaza set in a squalid strip of open drug dealing,
urine-stained streets and much misery.</TE>
<TE>   "I know people who've been there for eight or 12 years," she said
and sighed. "People get trapped down here just trying to survive."</TE>
<TE>   Cal Winslow, executive director of Community of Angels, and his
staff are not art critics. They review the submitted designs--300
this year--to ensure there is nothing offensive or overtly
commercial. Individuals, businesses or organizations can look through
a catalog and choose designs to sponsor, at fees starting at $3,500.</TE>
<TE>   Modeled on public art projects in Zurich and Chicago, the Los
Angeles group hopes to display 200 of the 100-pound statues beginning
this summer for at least several months. The angels echo the city's
name and are intended to inspire civic pride and a sense of unity.</TE>
<TE>   Winslow said he was so taken with Allen's design of butterflies
and her story that he persuaded the Volunteers of America to sponsor
her statue.</TE>
<TE>   "My heart went out to her," Winslow said. "A lot of artists pick
up the templates for designs and never return, but Michelle was back
with bells on. People see these beautiful angels but don't know the
stories behind them and some, like hers, are really interesting."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, much like her talent for art, surviving seems to be a
thing that Allen does well. At 12, after reporting sexual abuse by a
relative, Michelle Ophelia Allen was placed by authorities in a Los
Angeles foster care group home, she said. She remained there until
she was 17, when she emancipated herself by fleeing.</TE>
<TE>   She endured, finding odd jobs and going to school. She graduated
from Azusa Pacific University and then trained to become a licensed
vocational nurse. She specialized in pediatric home care, working
with children recuperating from serious illnesses or permanently
tethered to ventilators.</TE>
<TE>   But by the time she was 25, Allen had begun to develop arthritis,
which deteriorated until the pain and frequent falls forced her a few
years ago to quit nursing. She also developed diabetes and other
illnesses.</TE>
<TE>   She lost an apartment, spent time in a friend's garage and took to
riding the bus all night, using fast-food restrooms to wash up.</TE>
<TE>   Through her life, art has been her buoy. She used to volunteer at
Los Angeles County/USC Medical Center and created paintings for
patients. Soon her work began to go up on the ward floors.</TE>
<TE>   Allen has sold her work at fund-raising events sponsored by CARES,
the nonprofit group that runs the hospital's gift shop and child-care
centers.</TE>
<TE>   "Even when she didn't sell a lot of work, everyone who saw her
paintings was uplifted," said CARESadministrative secretary Nancy
Castillo. "She would talk to patients and share how she was ill but
was still able to paint and keep her dream alive."</TE>
<TE>   The hospital used one of her drawings on T-shirts for a health
fair.</TE>
<TE>   Now she is painting an angel.</TE>
<TE>   Allen works in the Ballington lobby, usually late at night into
the early morning. She sketches patterns of butterflies and flora and
fills them in with acrylic paints. She then adds a sealing varnish to
protect the art from the elements. Much of the body was painted in a
four-day spurt.</TE>
<TE>   She is unsure where her statue will be displayed, but it could
travel to a number of places, including 7th and Figueroa or Pershing
Square.</TE>
<TE>   When it debuts in June with the other statues, Allen will join
artists such as Hiro Yamagata, Pierre Matisse, grandson of the iconic
French painter, and Rose Parade float designer Raul Rodriguez, who
designed angels last year.</TE>
<TE>   The rending from home continues to be a source of turmoil. Her
mother lives in Southern California, and Allen has two siblings. But
she is not in contact, she said.</TE>
<TE>   People who have encountered Allen describe a warm spirit.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a sweet person who has had a lot of unfortunate things
happen," said Vivian Washington, who works in the art and music
department at the downtown Central Library, where Allen frequently
does research. "What attracted me to her art are the colors. There is
a richness in the images that seem very lifelike."</TE>
<TE>   Allen will be showing some of her work on May 18 at the Hanson Dam
Recreation Center and July 23 and 24 at County USC Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Many have suggested that she call her angel "Hope."</TE>
<TE>   "Art is really sacred to me, and I believe it's God's path for
me," she said. "It's all worth being in this place, because the angel
has given me back my faith."</TE>

<HD>Caltrans Asks for Caution in 'Cone Zones'</HD>
<DH>Safety: A $3.5-million ad campaign alerts drivers that work
areas, affecting 20% of state highways, are hazardous to crews and
motorists alike.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With freeway work increasing under the state's largest transportation
budget, the California Department of Transportation has launched a
$3.5-million ad campaign warning motorists to be cautious around work
crews making road improvements.</LD>
<LD>   Since 1924, 157 Caltrans employees have been killed and hundreds
more injured in the line of duty, most of them victims of errant
motorists who have plowed into crews working on the freeways.</LD>
<LD>   Caltrans officials fear the death toll may climb with the increase
in freeway construction under the $5.3-billion transportation budget
approved by Gov. Gray Davis in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   By the end of the year, one in every five miles of state highways
will be under repair or improvement under the governor's budget.</TE>
<TE>   An average of two Caltrans workers die each year while on duty.
Their names are added to a plaque at Caltrans headquarters in
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   In April of each year, Caltrans officials hold a news conference
and a ceremony to remember the fallen workers.</TE>
<TE>   In past ceremonies, orange cones were used to represent each
Caltrans fatality.</TE>
<TE>   For each Caltrans death, said Caltrans spokesman Bob Connor,
nearly 50 motorists are killed in accidents at freeway work zones.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Caltrans has launched several campaigns to warn
drivers about the problem.</TE>
<TE>   The latest statewide campaign is Caltrans' most expensive effort
to spotlight the deaths, Connor said.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign began with television ads last month and will
continue with radio ads this month and billboards in the next few
weeks. The campaign will continue for 90 days in English and Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   The television spots show motorists speeding past orange cones and
Caltrans workers on the side of a road. A narrator says:</TE>
<TE>   "Somehow, the family and friends of people who have been injured
and killed in highway work zones see orange cones differently than
the average driver....</TE>
<TE>   "Please slow for the cone zone."</TE>
<TE>   The ad ends with a close-up of an orange cone and a handful of
flowers, representing a memorial to a killed Caltrans worker.</TE>
<TE>   The Caltrans campaign was designed by Glass McClure Advertising of
Sacramento, which is known for its ads for Amtrak and Sizzler
restaurants.</TE>

<HD>Some Oppose Giving Davis CHP Control</HD>
<DH>Security: The director of the agency that now manages the
Highway Patrol says the measure would harm interagency coordination.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A legislative plan to put the California Highway Patrol under tighter
control of Gov. Gray Davis as a response to terrorism is meeting
resistance from within the Davis administration.</LD>
<LD>   Davis has taken no position, but the legislation is vigorously
backed by the Assn. of California Highway Patrol Officers, a
political ally of the governor and a generous contributor to his
election campaigns.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, SB 1996, by Sen. Betty Karnette (D-Long Beach), would
transfer direct control of the CHP to the governor from the patrol's
current administrative parent, the Business, Transportation and
Housing Agency.</LD>
<TE>   Nobody in the Davis administration is on record as officially
opposed to the idea, but Maria L. Contreras-Sweet, director of
Business, Transportation and Housing, defended her agency's role in
managing the patrol.</TE>
<TE>   Transferring the CHP from her control would cripple the agency's
role in coordinating the many interlocking bureaucratic functions of
the DMV, Caltrans, the traffic safety office and the CHP,
Contreras-Sweet said.</TE>
<TE>   She praised Karnette as "a bright star" in the Legislature and
said she respects the Highway Patrol union. But she indicated she
opposes anything that would weaken her agency's ability to coordinate
actions and policies.</TE>
<TE>   "We play an important coordinating function every single day to
make sure these departments ... are working for the safety of the
people," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Karnette said the idea came to her in the aftermath of the
terrorist attacks on the East Coast. She said that as a consequence
of the attacks, the Highway Patrol has become California's front-line
law enforcement department in dealing with scores of terrorism
issues.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the patrol has added intensified surveillance of
roads, bridges and vulnerable public works to its normal traffic
duties. It also guards the statewide electricity grid and puts armed
plainclothes officers on airliners as marshals.</TE>
<TE>   Karnette said she knew of no cases in which the patrol had been
delayed or stopped from performing anti-terrorist duties by its
parent agency, which reports to Davis. But she said the new era
called for streamlining administrative changes.</TE>
<TE>   "With the new emphasis on security, the Highway Patrol should be
under the direct administration of the governor," Karnette said last
week. "I just think it might be more efficient."</TE>
<TE>   She praised the way the CHP handled swift mobilizations and new
security duties since Sept. 11. But Karnette said she believed the
CHP could be quicker and more flexible if it reported directly to
Davis instead of agencyConteras-Sweet, a Cabinet officer appointed by
Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Originally, Karnette's bill would have stripped the CHP, the state
Office of Traffic Safety and the departments of Motor Vehicles and
Transportation from the umbrella of the Business, Transportation and
Housing Agency and created a new agency to house them.</TE>
<TE>   The bill cleared the Senate Governmental Organization Committee on
April 9. But last week Karnette amended it radically in the
Transportation Committee, abandoning other provisions and rewriting
it to give the governor exclusive control over the patrol.</TE>
<TE>   The Transportation Committee endorsed the overhauled bill and
forwarded it to the Appropriations Committee, the final stop before a
vote of the full Senate.</TE>
<TE>   In its original form, the patrol had a "neutral" stance on the
bill.</TE>
<TE>   But CHP Commissioner D.O. "Spike" Helmick said that in the
aftermath of Karnette's rewrite he had been asked by superiors in
Contreras-Sweet's office to "reevaluate our position." He hinted that
the patrol's new position would be in opposition to the bill but
declined to discuss specifics.</TE>
<TE>   The 6,900-member Assn. of California Highway Patrol Officers,
which represents virtually every officer, from the newest rookie to
Helmick, is among Davis' strongest supporters. Records show it gave
him more than $167,000 in campaign donations since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The longtime lobbyist for the association, Aaron Reed, said the
CHP has little in common with other children of the parent agency,
including the Department of Corporations, California Housing Finance
Authority, Department of Real Estate and the Department of
Information Technology.</TE>
<TE>   Other government entities have long reported directly to the
governor. They include the Office of Emergency Services, Department
of Veterans Affairs, Department of Food and Agriculture, and the
Office of Criminal Justice Planning.</TE>

<HD>Digging Deep to Keep Classes Small</HD>
<DH>Schools: The Irvine district finds out today whether a
fund-raising campaign has saved a 20-student maximum, as well as some
arts and science programs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA BORGATTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>School officials in Irvine will learn today whether a three-month
campaign has rounded up enough money to keep the district in a
celebrated state program limiting class sizes in primary grades.</LD>
<LD>   To help balance a $5.2-million budget deficit, the Irvine Unified
School District's Board of Education in January announced plans to
cut the program, which limits class sizes to 20 students in
kindergarten through third grade.</LD>
<LD>   After hearing that the program was threatened, parents quickly
rallied behind the district, organizing several campaigns that have
raised more than $500,000 since February. That, coupled with another
half-million dollars the district would get from the state to help
fund the program, would be enough to spare class-size reduction in
kindergarten through grade two, Supt. Patricia Clark White said.</LD>
<TE>   This morning, the Irvine Public Schools Foundation was still
collecting donations in hopes of reinstating the program in
third-grade classrooms. That would take an additional $425,000, said
Tim Shaw, the foundation's executive director.</TE>
<TE>   But at least $500,000 for the other classes has already been
secured, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw said he is optimistic that the program will be spared in all
four grades.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not unrealistic, but it's going to take people honoring
their pledges," Shaw said. "So far, people have been good about
that.... We've even had some people say, 'Just double mine,' or 'Put
in an extra 50 bucks.'"</TE>
<TE>   It's not the first time private donations have saved district
programs. Two years ago, last-minute donations by the Irvine Co. and
Donald Bren Foundation, totaling more than $2 million, saved art,
music and science programs, which are also in jeopardy again.</TE>
<TE>   Parent Linda Roberts hopes the foundation's campaign succeeds. Her
daughter will be entering second grade in the fall. The Roberts
family has been upset since the district decided to close its
neighborhood school, Los Naranjos Elementary, which will save the
district about $400,000 a year. Losing the intimacy of a small class
would be a double blow.</TE>
<TE>   "When the decision came down to increase class sizes, it was
horrible," Roberts said. "First we lost our school, now this.... It's
been a long year, and everybody's tired--tired of fighting to keep
our schools open, tired of trying to get parents to donate money to
keep class-size reduction going, then to keep music and science."</TE>
<TE>   The money also means scores of jobs will be saved in the district.
In March, 130 layoff notices were mailed to faculty. The board is
expected to decide tonight whether to eliminate an additional 50
teaching positions that would no longer be necessary with larger
classes, and will determine which programs will be restored.</TE>
<TE>   "But if enough money is raised to continue with reduced class
sizes, we will begin to reinstate teachers from the list," White
said.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation also expects to collect enough money--roughly
$300,000--to reinstate the district's sixth-grade science program and
art programs in grades three through six.</TE>
<TE>   "But we can't from year to year be relying on philanthropy," Shaw
said. "And despite what we're going to be able to save, there are
still going to be cuts. We are going to lose some nurses in the
schools, counselors, some science and music teachers. This did not
solve our budget crisis--it didn't even come close."</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Unified isn't alone. Schools all over California are in
financial straits, the result of a $12.5-billion shortfall in the
state's budget.</TE>
<TE>   Later this month, Capistrano Unified School District officials
will consider $6 million in cuts, including administrative layoffs,
and delays in school construction and implementing new high school
graduation requirements.</TE>
<TE>   "But all this comes with the caveat that the state budget remains
the same," said Capistrano Unified spokesman David Smollar. "If the
governor does something drastic in his revised budget, and the
schools end up with substantially less, then the superintendent will
have to go back to the budget advisory board."</TE>
<TE>   Saddleback Valley Unified, which faced a $1.5-million shortfall
next year, has balanced the budget by sending layoff notices to 160
employees, including about 40 teachers, said William Manahan,
assistant superintendent.</TE>
<TE>   "We've done all the preliminary cuts to custodians and maintenance
of the grounds--we're at the bare bones," Manahan said. "But next
year, it's going to affect the hands-on science and music programs in
the first through third grades. We just don't see any new revenue
coming in."</TE>
<TE>   A group of Saddleback parents have rallied as well. Calling
themselves Project Hope, the group has raised about $100,000 for the
district. "But that's a far cry from $1.5 million," Manahan said.</TE>
<TE>   In Irvine, several heavy hitters stepped up to the plate in recent
months, including the city, which gave $100,000 to the foundation,
and the Maruchan food company, which gave $50,000.</TE>

<HD>Irvine Donors Saving Smaller Classes in 3, if Not 4, Grades</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>School officials in Irvine will learn today whether a three-month
campaign can round up enough money to preserve small class sizes in
all four of the earliest primary grades.</LD>
<LD>   To help balance a $5.2-million budget deficit, the Irvine Unified

pull out of the state-sponsored program, which limits class sizes to

$300,000--to reinstate the district's sixth-grade science program and
art programs in grades three through six.</TE>
<TE>   "But we can't from year to year be relying on philanthropy," Shaw
said. "And despite what we're going to be able to save, there are
still going to be cuts. We are going to lose some nurses in the
schools, counselors, some science and music teachers. This did not
solve our budget crisis--it didn't even come close."</TE>
<TE>   Irvine isn't alone. Schools all over California are in financial
straits, the result of a $12.5-billion shortfall in the state's
budget.</TE>
<TE>   Later this month, Capistrano Unified School District officials
will consider $6 million in cuts, including administrative layoffs,
and delays in school construction and implementing new high school
graduation requirements.</TE>
<TE>   "But all this comes with the caveat that the state budget remains
the same," said Capistrano Unified spokesman David Smollar. "If the
governor does something drastic in his revised budget, and the
schools end up with substantially less, then the superintendent will
have to go back to the budget advisory board."</TE>
<TE>   Saddleback Valley Unified, which faced a $1.5-million shortfall
next year, has balanced the budget by sending layoff notices to 160
employees, including about 40 teachers, said William Manahan,
assistant superintendent.</TE>
<TE>   "We've done all the preliminary cuts to custodians and maintenance
of the grounds--we're at the bare bones," Manahan said. "But next
year, it's going to affect the hands-on science and music programs in
the first through third grades. We just don't see any new revenue
coming in."</TE>
<TE>   A group of Saddleback parents have rallied as well. Calling
themselves Project Hope, the group has raised about $100,000 for the
district. "But that's a far cry from $1.5 million," Manahan said.</TE>
<TE>   In Irvine, several heavy hitters stepped up to the plate in recent
months, including the city, which gave $100,000 to the foundation,
and the Maruchan food company, which gave $50,000.</TE>

<HD>Shift in Clerk's Office Studied</HD>
<DH>County: Recorder claims a plan to take minutes and agendas
out of his control would lessen public access.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County Clerk-Recorder Richard Dean is blasting a proposal to
shift control of the Board of Supervisors' agenda, records and
minutes from his office to the county manager's office, saying it
would be like letting "a fox in the henhouse."</LD>
<LD>   Such a move would give supervisors "total control" over what
appears on meeting documents and could diminish the public's ability
to access government records, Dean argued in a letter to the Board of
Supervisors.</LD>
<LD>   "Appointed county managers who serve at the will of the board are
good people, but their jobs and livelihoods are on the line," Dean
wrote. "In the end, they will either do what they are told (right or
wrong), ignore the order and risk being fired, or they resign."</LD>
<TE>   Supervisors are expected to take up the issue at today's board
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Kathy Long in January asked County Executive Officer
Johnny Johnston to study the possibility of moving the clerk of the
board's duties out of Dean's office. Supervisors Steve Bennett and
Judy Mikels backed Long's request.</TE>
<TE>   Long said it makes more sense for those duties to be carried out
under the executive officer's authority--a model followed by 41 other
California counties.</TE>
<TE>   In his report, Johnston did not make a recommendation on the move
but laid out the steps that would have to be taken. Johnston said
there could be some cost savings.</TE>
<TE>   Dean could not be reached for comment Monday. But in his letter to
supervisors, he noted that the county's elected clerk-recorder has
had responsibility for the clerk of the board's duties for more than
a century. In addition to preparing the agenda for Board of
Supervisors meetings, the clerk keeps records of minutes and updates
the county government's Web page.</TE>
<TE>   "The current structure has served the citizens of Ventura County
very well for almost 130 years," Dean wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Mikels, however, said she has long been concerned about Dean's
management of the $329,000, four-employee division. The system of
public access to records has not been sufficiently modernized, Mikels
said.</TE>
<TE>   And there have been times when she has had difficulty placing
items on the agenda, the supervisor said. Mikels dismissed Dean's
claim that supervisors might try to keep controversial issues from
public view if the change were made.</TE>
<TE>   Several laws and regulations, including California's Ralph M.
Brown Act, protect the public's interests, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way that it's going to become unbalanced," she said.
"This idea that the board will manipulate the public's access to
information is absolute hogwash."</TE>

<HD>Israeli Detention of 2 Americans Questioned</HD>
<DH>Conflict: Anaheim physician, director of Dallas charity
held. Muslim groups ask for intervention.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Arab Americans were detained by Israeli authorities over the
weekend for unspecified reasons after visiting refugee camps in the
West Bank, government officials and associates of the pair said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Although a spokeswoman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry said she
could not confirm the detentions, U.S. government officials and
others said Dr. Riad Abdelkarim, an Anaheim physician, was taken into
custody Saturday at Ben Gurion Airport as he attempted to board a
plane heading home.</LD>
<LD>   Dalell Mohmed, director of the Dallas-based charity
KinderUSA--founded by Abdelkarim--was detained on Sunday morning at
her hotel in Jerusalem, according to interviews.</LD>
<TE>   Both Abdelkarim, a Santa Monica-born Palestinian American, and
Mohmed, a second-generation Lebanese American, went to Israel as part
of separate humanitarian aid efforts, family members and others said.</TE>
<TE>   Abdelkarim and Mohmed have connections to the Holy Land
Foundation, a Texas-based Islamic charity whose assets were frozen by
the U.S. government in December because of the group's alleged
support for the Palestinian militant organization Hamas. Abdelkarim
served on the Holy Land board for the last half of 2001 and Mohmed
worked for the group for almost two years, serving for a time as its
communications director.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law enforcement officials said Monday they had no
information indicating that the detentions of Abdelkarim and Mohmed
were connected to the ongoing U.S. investigation of the Holy Land
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not being done in conjunction with anything we are doing"
about the group, said Lori Bailey of the FBI's Dallas office.
"Whatever is going on over there [in Israel] is totally their
business."</TE>
<TE>   Another federal law enforcement source cautioned against any
conclusion that Abdelkarim or Mohmed had any part in the charity's
allegedly questionable activities simply because they belonged to the
group.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., American Islamic groups
Monday urged U.S. officials to intervene on behalf of the two
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a pattern of Israel blocking humanitarian aid to the
Palestinians. They did so during the siege, and now they are
hampering the efforts of Americans to provide aid," said Khalid
Turaani, executive director of the Washington-based advocacy group
American Muslims for Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless there is a serious intervention by the U.S. government,
those people are not going to be in very good shape," Turaani said,
noting that Abdelkarim has long suffered from asthma.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to maintaining a medical practice, Abdelkarim is an
author and lecturer who has long been openly critical of both
terrorism and America's "one-sided" support of Israel. He is in the
Middle East, according to family members and associates, as part of a
fact-finding effort by the Los Angeles-based International Medical
Corps, a nonprofit organization founded in 1984 by volunteer doctors
and nurses in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The trip was one of many that Abdelkarim, a married father of
four, has made to the region in recent years--a fact that made his
current detention all the more baffling for friends and family.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, the overriding emotion is one of fear,
apprehension and plain confusion," said Nidal Abrahim, a family
friend.</TE>
<TE>   There is no evidence, Abrahim said, that Abdelkarim is "anything
other than a doctor in a humanitarian mission. At this point we have
no clue why he's being held."</TE>
<TE>   Since his detention, family members have been pressing for answers
from politicians, the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, human rights groups
and attorneys. A family friend said an attorney in Jerusalem has been
hired, but so far he has been denied permission to see Abdelkarim.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) said that although details
of the situation are sketchy, he has been monitoring it and has been
assured that Abdelkarim has been allowed to speak with U.S. officials
in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "Guilty or innocent of anything, he is a U.S. citizen and it is
normal for our embassy to be given access," Cox said. "And that is
what I am told has happened here."</TE>

<HD>Downtown L.A. Thinks Big</HD>
<DH>Development: Plan would create thousands of homes and
possibly include a new stadium.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council is poised to adopt a massive
redevelopment district for downtown Los Angeles that would create
thousands of new homes--and possibly ease the way for construction of
a stadium for a professional football team.</LD>
<LD>   Local business officials and others hail the plan as key to
revitalizing downtown. However, advocates for the poor are concerned
that the proposal will lead to gentrification and skyrocketing
housing prices.</LD>
<LD>   County officials, meanwhile, complained last week that the county
would be illegally deprived of $278 million in tax revenue and raised
the possibility of a lawsuit to stop the plan.</LD>
<TE>   The district was proposed by the city's Community Redevelopment
Agency. The agency's goals are to create up to 12,900 new units of
housing--a quarter of which would be affordable housing, and up to
6.7 million square feet of new commercial and industrial development.
The agency also hopes the plan will attract businesses and jobs, help
the city's 11,000 homeless people and rehabilitate historic buildings
in an 879-acre swath--or 180 city blocks--in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The agency anticipates spending nearly $2.4 billion in tax revenue
and other funds to accomplish its goals over the next 30 to 45 years.</TE>
<TE>   The "City Center" redevelopment area--bounded by 2nd and 3rd
streets on the north; San Pedro Street, Stanford Avenue and Griffith
Avenue on the east; the Santa Monica Freeway on the south, and
Figueroa Street and the Harbor Freeway on the west--includes the
South Park, Historic Downtown and City Markets neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Spivack, deputy administrator of the agency, said the City
Council ordered the agency to put the project on a fast track. It
typically takes 18 months to create a redevelopment proposal, but the
City Center plan was formulated in less than half that time, he said.</TE>
<TE>   During a public hearing last week, many council members expressed
enthusiasm for the plan. The council is expected to adopt it at its
regular meeting Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   If approved, about 60% of future property taxes generated in the
district would be given to the agency to redevelop the area.
One-fifth would be set aside in a housing trust fund, and the
remaining 20% would be distributed to normal tax collectors--the
city, county and school district.</TE>
<TE>   The agency can condemn land and displace residents and businesses,
but it has to create an affordable housing unit for each one it tears
down and help relocate involuntarily displaced people.</TE>
<TE>   A previous redevelopment district existed in the area, but the
agency hasn't received any money from it since November 2000, when it
hit a legal cap of $750 million. The plan, known as the Central
Business District, led to the creation of Staples Center and more
than 20 million square feet of commercial and industrial development.</TE>
<TE>   "While a lot has been accomplished, a great deal still remains to
be done," Councilwoman Jan Perry said. "A new plan will generate
revenues and provide the necessary tools to positively spur
development in the downtown core of Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Philip Anschutz, who owns Staples Center and all or part of 18
sports franchises, is heading a coalition of L.A. business leaders
who want to build a football stadium in South Park, which advocates
say will bring the NFL back to L.A. for the first time since the
Raiders and Rams left in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   City officials say the stadium was never the goal of the proposal,
though it could facilitate land acquisition through the agency's
power to condemn and acquire private property. Perry emphasized that
the focus of the redevelopment project is providing housing and
helping the homeless.</TE>
<TE>   However, advocates for the poor are worried that three-quarters of
the new housing will be rented at market rate.</TE>
<TE>   "This is unacceptable," said Becky Dennison, an organizer with the
L.A. Coalition to End Hunger and Homelessness, at a council hearing
on the matter last week. "We are already severely impacted by
homelessness and a lack of affordable housing."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Bonar, of the Skid Row Housing Trust, added, "The plan fails
to address the needs of very-low-income people."</TE>
<TE>   Spivack countered that the plan will increase the amount of money
being spent on such issues.</TE>
<TE>   "Change is going to happen in these areas, and there is a need to
deal with providing affordable housing, particularly very low-income
housing and the needs of the homeless population," he said. "There
are no other revenue sources that are available to deal with these
needs, now or in the future," except for the redevelopment plan.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Los Angeles County is arguing that certain areas that
were in the old redevelopment district and a 30-acre parking lot
slated to be turned into a $1-billion sports and entertainment
district should not be included in the redevelopment district. The
county stands to lose $278 million over 45 years because it would
receive a sliver of the property taxes that it currently gets,
according to a memo written to county supervisors by county Chief
Administrative Officer David E. Janssen.</TE>
<TE>   The county filed an objection to the proposal last week, which
would allow the county to sue in the future. Martin Zimmerman, an
assistant division chief in the county Chief Administrative Office,
declined to comment on whether a lawsuit is likely, but noted that
the county has sued Los Angeles and Arcadia over prior redevelopment
projects.</TE>
<TE>   Spivack said he disagreed with the county's claims. His agency
will respond to the county's concerns and those of the advocates for
the poor at the meeting Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Perry said she hoped the county doesn't take legal action, but
instead works with the city and the agency to deal with the problems
of homelessness.</TE>
<TE>   Business, historic and other officials say the plan--coupled with
ongoing projects such as the Walt Disney Concert Hall and the
Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels--are key to revitalizing
downtown.</TE>
<TE>   "We are on the verge of such a renaissance in Los Angeles," added
Ken Bernstein, director of preservation issues for the Los Angeles
Conservancy. "This plan is about more than downtown's narrow
interests--it's in everyone's interest in the city of Los Angeles."</TE>

<HD>An Early Entrance Urged for Exit Exam</HD>
<DH>Education: Santa Paula superintendent believes the test,
which the state requires students to pass to graduate, should first
be taken in ninth grade.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fewer than one in four Santa Paula High School freshmen last year
passed a test they'll need to master before they can graduate in
2004, which has Supt. William Brand pushing state education officials
to allow his and other poor-performing districts to keep testing
ninth-graders.</LD>
<LD>   A new law now prohibits students from taking the California High
School Exit Exam until they reach 10th grade. California Department
of Education officials wanted to obtain a "pure sample" of teenagers
who have taken the test for the first time.</LD>
<LD>   But Brand, along with a handful of superintendents across the
state, said allowing districts to administer the exam to
ninth-graders could make a big difference in a place like Santa
Paula, where 35% of sophomores still struggle to speak English and
more than half the students come from low-income homes.</LD>
<TE>   "If I were superintendent of a high-achieving, affluent school
district, I'm not going to worry about it," Brand said. "But when you
have kids coming in at risk, you need to have all of the
opportunities available to them."</TE>
<TE>   The exit exam was taken voluntarily in March 2001 by 6,500 members
of the class of 2004. Only 34% passed both sections.</TE>
<TE>   This spring, those 10th-graders who either didn't take the exam or
didn't pass both sections were required to take the exam.</TE>
<TE>   The test results are expected to land in district offices and
parents' mailboxes within the next three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning with this year's sophomore class, all
students--including those in special education classes and
alternative programs--must pass the exit exam before they can earn a
diploma, even if all other graduation requirements are met.</TE>
<TE>   The language section of the test covers material students should
learn by 10th grade.</TE>
<TE>   The math section includes concepts taught through eighth grade,
plus algebra, which is generally taken by the sophomore year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Weak Results for English Learners</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, 73% of the freshmen who took the test in 2001
passed the language arts section, while only 53% passed math.</TE>
<TE>   But among English learners, fewer than one-third passed in
language and just 15% successfully completed the math section.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly weak results were found among economically disadvantaged
students.</TE>
<TE>   At Delano Joint Union High School District in Kern County, where a
high percentage of students live in poverty and struggle to speak
English, more than 80% of students enter ninth grade below grade
level, said Supt. Sherrill Hufnagel.</TE>
<TE>   "Those students are already behind, so it's going to be that much
more difficult to pass," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Hufnagel can see a difference in attitude about the test among
this year's sophomores, all of whom were given the exit test last
year, and the freshmen, many of whom are still oblivious to the
seriousness of the high-stakes exam they'll take next year.</TE>
<TE>   "My feeling is, the sooner we expose the students to the issue
that they need to pass the test, the better," she said. "Students
just aren't going to take the test seriously unless they get a chance
to look at it and, in their freshman year, know they are going to
have to work hard to pass it."</TE>
<TE>   Brand stresses that allowing students to take the exam as
ninth-graders gives officials one additional year to place those
lagging behind in after-school and summer programs.</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone agrees with that approach to raising the pass
rate.</TE>
<TE>   State education officials point out that sophomores will have
seven additional chances to pass the exit exam after they take it for
the first time, as well as one final opportunity the summer after
their senior year.</TE>
<TE>   Martha Tureen, an assistant superintendent in the low-performing
Fillmore Unified School District, said she does not see the logic
behind giving more assessments to students who are already heavily
tested.</TE>
<TE>   "If a kid is not prepared, testing him more times isn't going to
get him prepared," Tureen said. "I'd rather spend the time on
instruction."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   State Needs Data Before Adjusting Test</TE>
<TE>   Last year, about 78% of freshmen took the exam statewide. Those
who didn't had to do so this year, but that doesn't leave the state
with a full sample of students of the same age group taking the test
for the first time. That full sample of sophomores won't be available
until 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The resulting data are crucial because state officials are
considering adjusting the levels for a passing score.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, students must get 65% of questions correct to pass
either section, but that could change, said Jan Chladek, manager of
the high school exit exam office in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Such explanations do not satisfy local school leaders like Brand,
who remains committed to fighting for students who seem to be
consistently overlooked in the state's push for more and more
standardized tests.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything I've heard from the state has to do with the validity
of testing," Brand said. "They have never once talked about what's
good for kids."</TE>

<HD>Mystery Clouds Arson Case</HD>
<DH>Crime: Police have no suspects in the killings of four
relatives in the Hollywood Hills. Cause of the deaths has yet to be
determined.</DH>

<AU>LAURA LOH and RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Why anyone wanted to kill 16-year-old Tulsi Kumar, her brother,
mother and grandmother remained a mystery to police and relatives
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   With arson investigators, computer experts and homicide detectives
trying to reconstruct the events that unfolded before Saturday
night's blaze at the family's Hollywood Hills home, authorities said
there won't be a quick resolution to the crime.</LD>
<LD>   "It's going to a be a while," LAPD Capt. Jim Tatreau said. "It's a
real whodunit."</LD>
<TE>   Harish "Harry" Kumar told detectives who interviewed him all day
Sunday that he arrived home at 11:15 p.m. Saturday to find his house
engulfed in flames.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives said he remains dazed by the loss of wife Gita, mother
Sitaben Patel, son Paras and daughter Tulsi. Nor can they think of
any enemies the couple or their children might have had, relatives
said.</TE>
<TE>   "He just keeps saying, 'I've lost everything,'" said Chandu Patel,
a relative who comforted Kumar at another relative's house near the
charred Lakeridge Drive home.</TE>
<TE>   Tatreau said there are no suspects, and no one has been ruled out.
He said Kumar has been cooperative, but he would not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Kumar's cousin, Danny Patel, said police gave Kumar a lie detector
test, but the LAPD would not confirm that.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the coroner's office said dental records will be
required to identify the bodies. The cause of the deaths has not yet
been determined.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Collis, a Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman, said that
investigators found traces of a flammable liquid in more than one
location in the house and that the blaze began in two of the
bedrooms.</TE>
<TE>   An LAPD computer expert, according to sources, examined computers
in the home. B.N. Patel, another relative, said Tulsi Kumar was
communicating with a friend online before the tragedy. Detectives
also are examining financial records.</TE>
<TE>   Chandu Patel said he last saw Harish Kumar when Kumar dropped him
off at 10:30 p.m. at the Universal City Inn, one of the family's
three motels.</TE>
<TE>   He said Kumar then dropped off another man nearby before heading
home.</TE>
<TE>   At a memorial at Reseda High School, where Tulsi was a junior and
part of the school's magnet science academy, students prayed, cried
and shared stories about the girl they described as fun-loving and
humble. Robert Kladifko said she was "a very intelligent student" who
was on her way "to becoming a doctor or engineer or something
successful. She was well-liked by students and staff."</TE>
<TE>   A Hindu priest said a prayer before the memorial, and students
gathered at a makeshift altar to leave flowers.</TE>
<TE>   As about a dozen students wearing black read poems or recounted
experiences with Tulsi, sobs rose among relatives outside the school
gate. The memorial was a student-only event.</TE>
<TE>   Sagar Kumar, a cousin, said he had seen 18-year-old Paras Kumar
and his sister "every day since they were born."</TE>
<TE>   "We were like the Brady Bunch. I would call his parents Mom and
Dad, and he would do the same to my parents."</TE>
<TE>   Tragedy had struck the Kumars before, said Kirrit Bhikha, the
husband of Gita Kumar's youngest sister. He said more than a decade
ago, their eldest son was struck and killed by a car in Texas, where
the family lived for many years.</TE>

<HD>Defense Seeks to Bar Alleged Child Porn From Trial in Van
Dam Slaying</HD>
<DH>Court: Attorneys for David Westerfield say the images
seized at his home would prejudice the jury. Prosecutors contend
material shows motive in the killing of girl, 7.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Defense attorneys for David Westerfield are attempting to keep
alleged child pornography seized at his home from being introduced as
evidence in his upcoming trial on charges of kidnapping and killing
7-year-old Danielle van Dam, motions unsealed Monday indicate.</LD>
<LD>   The pornography is irrelevant to the kidnapping and murder charges
and liable to unfairly turn the jury against Westerfield because it
portrays children in "offensive" sexual activity, attorneys Robert E.
Boyce and Steven Feldman argued.</LD>
<LD>   But Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Dusek, in asking Superior Court Judge
William Mudd to reject the defense motion, said the child pornography
"is strong evidence of defendant's motive to kidnap, sexually abuse
and ultimately murder" Danielle.</LD>
<TE>   A pretrial hearing is set to begin today on a series of motions by
both sides. The trial has been scheduled for May 17.</TE>
<TE>   Boyce and Feldman said the pornography is irrelevant because there
is no evidence yet presented that Westerfield, 50, a self-employed
design engineer, ever looked at the images found on computer discs in
his garage. Also, they noted that Westerfield is not accused of
sexually molesting Danielle, whose family lived two doors away from
Westerfield in the upscale Sabre Springs neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   At an earlier hearing, the county medical examiner testified that
Danielle's body, found Feb. 28, 21 days after her parents reported
her missing, was too badly decomposed to allow him to determine how
she had been killed or whether she had been molested.</TE>
<TE>   At that hearing, prosecutors presented evidence that Danielle's
blood was found on Westerfield's jacket and that her fingerprints
were found in his recreational vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Boyce and Feldman are asking Mudd to keep the pornography from
being shown to the jury and also to order a separate trial on the
misdemeanor charge facing Westerfield of possession of child
pornography.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have alleged that pictures, cartoons and digital
images on discs found in Westerfield's garage show underage females
in sexual acts, in bondage and, in one case, crying for help.</TE>
<TE>   The defense attorneys conceded that the "cartoons and the
pornography depict extremely offensive sexual and nonsexual subjects"
and thus should be kept from the jury.</TE>
<TE>   "The subject of [Westerfield's] lifestyle is irrelevant on the
issue of guilt" on murder and kidnapping charges, Boyce and Feldman
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The defense also wants Mudd to exclude the tape-recording of the
tearful, panicky voice of Brenda van Dam calling 911 to report her
daughter missing.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors want Mudd to exclude evidence about drug use by Brenda
van Dam and her husband, Damon.</TE>

<HD>No Plans, No Graduation Rite, Seniors Told</HD>
<DH>Policy: Only students bound for college, a trade or
military can take part in ceremony.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 3,700 seniors at eight San Fernando Valley high schools may
have taken all the English, history and math classes required for a
diploma, but if they want to cross the stage at graduation, they'll
first need to take big steps for their future.</LD>
<LD>   Under a new, much-debated policy, those students will be allowed
to participate in graduation ceremonies only if they have committed
to post-secondary education or training--whether university,
community college, trade school or the military.</LD>
<LD>   Officials in the Los Angeles school system's local District C,
covering the southwest Valley, defend the policy as a way to
encourage more students to consider college or at least get them to
think about the future.</LD>
<TE>   Civil libertarians call the rule elitist, and students complain it
violates their right to graduate before parents and friends. Some
students said they obtained acceptance letters from community
colleges just to qualify for the graduation ceremony but have no
intention of enrolling.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nonsense," said Van Nuys High School senior Rafayel
Ambartsumyan, who also wrote an editorial against the policy in the
Mirror, the school newspaper. "A lot of students are going to lie
about [their plans for college]."</TE>
<TE>   While getting ready for the prom, seniors at Taft High scrambled
last week to meet a deadline to produce evidence of a post-secondary
commitment.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like [the policy]," said Kassie Finch. She got a letter
of acceptance from Pierce College in Woodland Hills so she can
participate in the graduation ceremony, but will likely work at her
mother's law office after graduation. "I'm not sure if I'm going to
college or not."</TE>
<TE>   Administrators acknowledge that the change is difficult for some
to accept, though no one will be denied a diploma if they don't
comply. But they stress that it has had positive results.</TE>
<TE>   Initial estimates show that 90% to 95% of District C seniors have
made a post-secondary commitment this year. Last year, without the
policy, 54% took that step. District C also has seen a 10% increase
in the number of students accepted into the University of California
system for next year, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "The policy basically says to our community that we hold very high
expectations of our graduates," said District C Supt. Robert Collins,
who first implemented the policy at Grant High School in 1987 when he
was principal there. "We feel all our graduates are ready and
recognize that to really be successful, you're going to need some
kind of post-secondary [education].... Is the policy harsh? I don't
think so at all. A harsh policy is when we ignore youngsters."</TE>
<TE>   Acceptance to a four-year college or university, a two-year
college, a trade or vocational program, an internship or
apprenticeship, or military service all qualify.</TE>
<TE>   The policy affects 3,764 graduating seniors at eight high schools:
Birmingham, Cleveland, Grant, Reseda, Taft, Van Nuys, Sherman Oaks
Center for Enriched Studies and Valley Alternative. None of the other
10 local districts in Los Angeles Unified has such a rule.</TE>
<TE>   Because some students did not realize they were eligible for the
ceremony, administrators are trying to reach and counsel the
estimated 185 students who have not complied. Three Birmingham High
School seniors who wanted to be chefs recently were persuaded to take
culinary courses, and a Cleveland High School student traveling in
France was declared eligible because he planned to learn French.</TE>
<TE>   Collins said the policy, announced in March 2001 for this June's
graduation, was cleared by the District C legal office.</TE>
<TE>   The rule was approved by Los Angeles Unified School District Supt.
Roy Romer, who called it an attempt to get kids focused. "And that's
a good intention."</TE>
<TE>   Kati Haycock, director of Education Trust, a school reform
advocacy group based in Washington, D.C., said the policy was "odd"
but important.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not unusual for high schools to be exploiting new ways to
[get students] thinking about college and preparing for college," she
said. "In this economy, if you don't have some post-secondary
education, the likelihood that you're going to get a decent job and
help support a family is nearly nonexistent."</TE>
<TE>   Teachers have discussed the policy in class and encouraged
students to write essays and letters  to elected officials. Melody
Separzadeh, vice president of Taft's senior class, said she has been
inundated with questions about the policy.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't want to do it," she said. "Some seniors don't even
know what they want to do after school. They feel like it's none of
the district's business."</TE>
<TE>   Still, many students are going to great lengths to comply because
they don't want to miss their graduation ceremony, Taft senior Mayra
Sanchez said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the whole reason we go to school," Sanchez said of
graduation. "My parents would have been very upset if I didn't walk
on stage."</TE>
<TE>   Elia Sheiner, a Taft guidance counselor, was skeptical of the
policy's long-term effect. "I don't know if it's going to make a
difference. I think the students who were already going to college
will, and the students who weren't, won't."</TE>
<TE>   But at the same school, Jeff Santana said he would have started
work at his dad's car transmission shop after graduation had he not
been made to think about college.</TE>
<TE>   Now he's planning to spend two years at Pierce College before
pursuing a degree in business administration at Cal State Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's actually pushing students to go to college," Santana
said. "Some kids wouldn't even know what they were doing if it wasn't
for [the policy]."</TE>
<TE>   Grant High School Principal Joseph Walker said the new rule seeks
to instill career ambition in students from impoverished
neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people are making a mountain out of a molehill," he said.
"What [Collins] did was encourage kids to think about what to do
after high school....The culture of going to college is foreign to
many here."</TE>
<TE>   District C serves a mixture of middle-class and low-income
communities, including Van Nuys, Valley Glen, Reseda, Woodland Hills,
Tarzana and Encino.</TE>
<TE>   Because many of the school district's students come from
working-class families, Ramona Ripston, executive director of the
Southern California chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union,
said she opposes the policy.</TE>
<TE>   Her group, however, won't sue to block it.</TE>
<TE>   "I approve of the aim, but I think it's unrealistic, because many
students probably are in families that are looking forward to their
children graduating so that they can get a job and help make ends
meet," she said. "It would be great if everybody could go to college,
but that's not always possible."</TE>

<HD>Beach Project to Face Voters</HD>
<DH>Redondo: Foes of redevelopment plan gather enough
signatures to put its fate on ballot. Council will reconsider its
earlier go-ahead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Redondo Beach activists have collected enough signatures to force a
controversial redevelopment plan known as Heart of the City onto the
ballot.</LD>
<LD>   The City Council will decide tonight whether to rescind the
resolutions that laid the groundwork for the project or let the
matter go to voters.</LD>
<LD>   "This is what the petitioners wanted, and they've complied with
the guidelines," said Redondo Beach Mayor Greg Hill, one of Heart of
the City's most vocal supporters.</LD>
<TE>   "People should have a right to vote, but I still believe this
isn't the way you do city planning," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Citizens for a Vote on Heart of the City was formed in late March
to protest the City Council's approval of the plan. The group
circulated two petitions against the project--one challenging the
zoning, the other the Specific Plan--and on April 18 submitted more
than 6,000 signatures for each initiative. The group needed about
4,000 signatures to force an election.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Cagle, the group's organizer, has said that the petitioners
are not looking to kill Heart of the City.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not every detail of the plan that people are uncomfortable
with," Cagle said. "Even if we vote no on this, that doesn't mean
they can't reopen the process and modify everything."</TE>
<TE>   Heart of the City, a massive redevelopment of the beachfront and
an aging power plant, would turn most of Catalina Avenue into a
residential neighborhood and transform the harbor into a seaside
village. Acres of parking lots would become a shopping district, and
a large portion of the 52-acre AES power plant would be leveled and
replaced with new offices and homes. The plan allows for 2,998 new
units and 657,000 square feet of commercial space, though AES is
planning to build only 1,100 units.</TE>
<TE>   If built to its maximum capacity, the project would produce about
3,500 extra vehicle trips during the evening rush hour. Heart of the
City detractors have said that Redondo Beach simply can't handle that
many cars and people.</TE>
<TE>   If the City Council does not vote to rescind the plan, it can call
a special election no sooner than Sept. 10 or hold the vote in
conjunction with the November general election.</TE>
<TE>   Combining the referendum with the city election next March also is
an option.</TE>
<TE>   Hill said he and other Heart of the City proponents will work to
ensure that Redondo Beach residents have accurate information before
they vote.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty easy to get people riled up against traffic and
congestion, but we're trying to get back the voice of reason," Hill
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The facts are being misconstrued," he said. "We're going to make
sure the truth is out there."</TE>

<HD>Huntington's Use-of-Force Suit Settled</HD>
<DH>Courts: The city pays $25,000 to a man who says an off-duty
officer punched and kicked him. The policeman denies any wrongdoing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Huntington Beach has paid $25,000 to a man who said he was punched
and kicked by an off-duty police officer during a confrontation at a
local pizza restaurant. The July 2000 episode was one of two within
24 hours that brought excessive-force allegations against Officer
Edmond Kennedy. A day later, a 17-year-old said Kennedy jumped on him
and threw him to the ground in response to a vulgar gesture.</LD>
<LD>   Kennedy has denied wrongdoing but acknowledged that his
supervisors disciplined him in both incidents. He said he is
appealing their decision.</LD>
<LD>   "They made a big deal out of nothing," he said, accusing the
department of overreacting to recent police misconduct scandals in
L.A. "They're looking for things that they normally wouldn't."</LD>
<TE>   Huntington Beach police officials said the two claims were so
serious that they took the unusual step of asking prosecutors to
review the cases for possible criminal charges against the officer.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office last year rejected the cases,
concluding that "there is a lack of sufficient evidence to support a
filing of criminal charges against Officer Kennedy," according to a
letter prosecutors sent the Police Department. Prosecutors declined
to provide more details.</TE>
<TE>   An Orange County Superior Court judge on Monday ordered the county
to release a second letter the district attorney sent the city about
the cases. But prosecutors said they will not provide the document
until the office decides whether to appeal the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest settlement, approved last month, Kristopher Scotten,
21, accused Kennedy of attacking him while he worked at a local Pizza
Hut.</TE>
<TE>   The two had a history of confrontation. A year earlier, Kennedy
had arrested the youngster after he drove slowly past Kennedy's home
blaring rap lyrics from his car that insulted police.</TE>
<TE>   Police reports say the two did not speak again until Scotten drove
past Kennedy's home while the off-duty officer was in his garage.</TE>
<TE>   Delivering pizzas, Scotten said he honked his horn at a friend who
lived nearby. The officer, however, called the Police Department,
told dispatchers that Scotten had shouted an insult at him and asked
for help. Kennedy chased Scotten to a Pizza Hut, where he told him he
was under arrest. Scotten refused to leave.</TE>
<TE>   The officer grabbed at his arm several times, but Scotten pulled
away, accusing Kennedy of assaulting him. The officer said Scotten
pushed him hard on the shoulder. "At that point, I believe the fight
was on," Kennedy recalled. "You don't struggle with a police officer
and then push him."</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy stepped back, kicked Scotten's stomach and punched him at
least twice in the face. Scotten did not strike the officer back, and
the two left together after a brief struggle.</TE>
<TE>   Scotten was arrested on suspicion of using offensive words in a
public place and resisting arrest, but the district attorney's office
declined to charge him.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy said supervisors told him he should have waited for other
officers before confronting Scotten. The officer would not say what
discipline they imposed.</TE>
<TE>   A day later, according to police reports, Kennedy was on patrol
when he spotted two teens walking on the beach, one of them smoking.
He cited the smoker, a 16-year-old girl, for being underage and
smoking.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy searched her companion, her boyfriend Adam McClain, and
found a cigarette lighter in his pocket. He ordered McClain to throw
it in a nearby trashcan. McClain threw it but missed. Kennedy ordered
him to pick up the lighter, but McClain walked away.</TE>
<TE>   The teen made an obscene gesture at the officer, according to
police reports. The officer said the boy also screamed obscenities at
him. As the teen walked through a throng of onlookers, Kennedy ran at
him and pushed him to the ground. Kennedy said the teen was unhurt
and that he acted because he feared McClain was about to become
violent.</TE>
<TE>   But McClain insisted that Kennedy struck him far harder than
necessary, causing a welt and back pain that lasted weeks.</TE>

<HD>Watchdog Gives LAPD Positive Marks</HD>
<DH>Report: Analysis praises disciplinary measures started
under Chief Bernard Parks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A decade after the Rodney King beating, the Los Angeles Police
Department has become "by and large successful" in curbing
misbehavior by following up on complaints, Inspector General Jeffrey
C. Eglash has concluded.</LD>
<LD>   The Eglash report, released just two days after the forced
retirement of former Chief Bernard C. Parks, gives a generally
positive appraisal of many of the changes in LAPD discipline during
his term and identifies areas in which improvement is needed.</LD>
<LD>   Investigations of officers accused of misconduct take too long and
are sometimes flawed, according to the report.</LD>
<TE>   Nonetheless, overall, LAPD's internal investigations are balanced
and objective, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, LAPD's disciplinary proceedings are slightly more likely
to produce findings against officers accused of misconduct than is
typically the case in police agencies, the report found.</TE>
<TE>   "With respect to the discipline system, I think we are doing
well," Eglash said.</TE>
<TE>   "But we need to go to the next level."</TE>
<TE>   Eglash is the Police Department's civilian watchdog, a position
created in 1995 following heightened public concern over officer
wrongdoing in the aftermath of the beating of Rodney King, the riots
and the Christopher Commission's report on police misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   The annual report, released Monday, is the first of its kind to be
completed since the office was created. It is scheduled for
consideration by the Los Angeles Police Commission today.</TE>
<TE>   Its release comes just weeks after the police commission decided
against a second term for Parks, who had come under fire over a
variety of issues, including his efforts to toughen officer
discipline.</TE>
<TE>   The commission is expected to name an interim chief today.</TE>
<TE>   Parks cherished his reputation as a disciplinarian, and his tenure
marked far-reaching changes in the LAPD's system of taking and
investigating complaints against officers.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Parks ordered all complaints to be recorded and
investigated, no matter how petty they seemed--a dramatic shift from
past policy.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, supervisors at the precinct level had broad discretion
to dismiss complaints they deemed too frivolous to be worthy of
further action.</TE>
<TE>   The result was that the number of investigations against LAPD
officers nearly tripled, creating a workload that nearly overwhelmed
the department's internal bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those investigations involved allegations of relatively
minor misconduct against officers, such as discourtesy.</TE>
<TE>   Administrative logjams meant many were resolved at glacial speed.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the new complaint system proved so controversial that
Parks was pressured to scale back some of his initial reforms.</TE>
<TE>   At its height, "the department went as far as any agency I'm aware
of in terms of recording or tracking complaints," Eglash said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Parks considered the complaint system one of his most
significant accomplishments, Eglash said the timing of the report's
release was unrelated to the decision to oust him.</TE>
<TE>   "All I can tell you is that this is something that we started work
on quite a while ago," Eglash said.</TE>
<TE>   The findings neither vindicate nor fault Parks, he said. "I don't
think it's really about him. It is a lot of statistical information,"
Eglash said.</TE>
<TE>   Allegations of discourtesy, nearly 22% of all public complaints,
were the most numerous.</TE>
<TE>   Complaints involving neglect of duty, unbecoming conduct and use
of force also were common.</TE>
<TE>   The most frequent allegation made by the department against its
own officers involved preventable traffic accidents.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer than one-third of all allegations against LAPD officers were
sustained from 1998 to 2001, the report found.</TE>
<TE>   The percentage of complaints made by the public that were
sustained is much lower, about 14%.</TE>
<TE>   Yet LAPD's internal investigations are still more likely to be
resolved in favor of the complainant than those at the San Jose, San
Francisco or San Diego County police departments, the report
concluded.</TE>
<TE>   The report also explores one of the most controversial allegations
frequently made against Parks, namely that his discipline system
favored some commanders over rank-and-file officers.</TE>
<TE>   The report identifies six questionable disciplinary
cases--including some in which it appeared high-ranking officers
received lighter penalties than lower-ranking officers for similar
offenses. It also noted mitigating circumstances in each case.</TE>
<TE>   "We found ... specific cases that raised concerns about disparity,
but we did not draw conclusions beyond that," Eglash said.</TE>
<TE>   In conclusion, the report recommended that the LAPD develop
greater flexibility in responding to citizens' complaints.</TE>
<TE>   The department should adopt a "customer service mentality," and
allow supervisors more discretion to respond informally to
complaints, Eglash said.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, he said, complaints should prompt "introspection" by
department brass, not just disciplinary proceedings, so that they can
be used as the basis for better policies, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Pete Trilling of the LAPD's Internal Affairs Group agreed
with the recommendations, saying the department, together with a
working group led by Police Commissioner Rose Ochi, is already at
work implementing similar ones.</TE>
<TE>   Although Police Commission President Rick Caruso said he had not
yet had a chance to read the report, he concurred with some of its
general findings about the disciplinary system.</TE>
<TE>   "We do a very good job in taking in complaints. We have that down
to perfection," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we need to have the same focus on disposing of them in timely
manner."</TE>
<TE>   In a separate report, Eglash also found that shootings by LAPD
officers have decreased, although the police are more likely to use
force to injure people in other ways.</TE>
<TE>   The number of officer-involved shootings has decreased from 97 in
1999 to 66 last year.</TE>
<TE>   The number of people injured by officers grew, but it was unclear
whether this trend reflects changes in police conduct, or improved
reporting policies.</TE>

<HD>Activists Criticize 4 McDonald's at LAX</HD>
<DH>Labor: Chain denies allegations it violated health and
safety codes and did not pay city fees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four McDonald's restaurants at Los Angeles International Airport
violated health and safety codes and employees there suffer dangerous
working conditions and intimidation by managers, according to a
report to be released today by a nonprofit worker advocacy group.</LD>
<LD>   McDonald's also failed to pay concession fees to the city agency
that operates LAX, according to the study by the Los Angeles Alliance
for a New Economy. The company has franchises in Terminals 1, 5 and
7, and the Tom Bradley International Terminal at LAX.</LD>
<LD>   A company spokeswoman disputed all the organization's claims and
said the restaurants have consistently received the county health
department's highest rating.</LD>
<TE>   The alliance has joined with several powerful labor unions in a
four-year campaign to improve working conditions at the world's third
busiest airport by unionizing employees and enforcing the city's
living-wage law.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's' 300 workers aren't unionized and the company is not
required to pay the city's living wage because its contract with the
airport agency predates the law's implementation in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The living-wage law requires companies that contract with the city
of Los Angeles to pay employees $7.99 an hour with benefits and $9.24
an hour without benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The alliance will present the report to the Airport Commission
today. The group hopes that the 16-page document will prompt the city
agency that operates LAX to reconsider a contract amendment it is
negotiating with McDonald's.</TE>
<TE>   "We want them to investigate whether this company should continue
operating at LAX," said Madeline Janis-Aparicio, alliance director.
"We think this is outrageous conduct and it cannot continue for one
day more."</TE>
<TE>   The McDonald's contract amendment would require the company to
resolve billing disputes with the airport agency and to institute the
living wage at its four LAX locations, said Paul Haney, an airport
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   The amendment may include an extension of the company's term at
the airport--which expires in 2005--but the length of this extension
hasn't been determined, he said.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's owes the airport more than $800,000 in concession fees,
according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   Haney could not confirm the number, saying that the amount owed is
in dispute.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's is committed to working with the airport agency to
resolve the billing disputes, said Lisa Howard, a spokeswoman at the
company's headquarters in Oak Brook, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   The health and safety violations cited by the alliance report and
based on Los Angeles County health department records include a
waste-water leak that shut down the McDonald's in Terminal 1 last
summer, and open chemical containers stored near food items in its
Terminal 7 restaurant last summer.</TE>
<TE>   The company disputed claims that it has ongoing health and safety
problems at its four LAX locations.</TE>
<TE>   "Since 1998 when the Los Angeles Department of Health Services
instituted a grading system, all four of our airport locations have
consistently received a grade of 'A,'" Howard said.</TE>
<TE>   The alliance report also mentions claims filed by McDonald's
workers with the California Occupational Safety and Health
Administration alleging dangerous working conditions at LAX
franchises.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's managers do not provide back support belts for workers
who carry loads of 35 pounds or more between terminals, and failed to
place rubber floor mats behind eatery counters--causing several
employees to slip and fall, according to the complaints.</TE>
<TE>   Managers also did not install first-aid kits in their restaurants,
forcing workers to use mustard to cool burns and coffee grounds to
soothe cuts, according to a complaint filed Friday.</TE>
<TE>   First-aid kits are available at all McDonald's restaurants and the
company isn't required by law to provide rubber mats--which can be a
tripping hazard--or safety belts to employees, Howard said.</TE>
<TE>   The report also includes several complaints of harassment or
intimidation by restaurant employees.</TE>
<TE>   Howard said she wasn't aware of any such problems at the airport
restaurants.</TE>

<HD>Masry's Accuser Testifies</HD>
<DH>Court: Former employee says Erin Brockovich's boss fired
her for refusing his advances. She is suing him for sexual
harassment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY THERMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An attorney tearfully told a Van Nuys jury Monday that she was fired
by the real-life employer of Erin Brockovich after refusing his
sexual advances.</LD>
<LD>   Kissandra Cohen made the allegation in her sexual harassment and
wrongful termination lawsuit against attorney Ed Masry, who is now
mayor of Thousand Oaks. Masry has denied that accusation and the
others in the suit.</LD>
<LD>   Cohen, 23, said that when she first walked into Masry's Westlake
Village office as a 19-year-old law student, she was awed by the
marble floors, expensive wood paneling and extravagant furnishings.</LD>
<TE>   She testified that on the basis of their conversation that day in
early 1999, Masry offered her a job as a $120,000-a-year attorney as
soon as she passed the bar exam. That December, after working for him
for several months, she said, "Mr. Masry fired me, basically because
I wouldn't have a personal relationship with him."</TE>
<TE>   Cohen said that her mistreatment at the law firm left her so
depressed that she attempted suicide twice. She testified she has
been unable to find employment since.</TE>
<TE>   Masry talked incessantly about women's breasts and used a steady
stream of sexual epithets to refer to women in the office and
clients, including actress Pamela Anderson, Cohen said.</TE>
<TE>   Her lawsuit also alleges that Masry and another lawyer in the
11-attorney firm, James Brown, hounded her with suggestive language
and crude jokes.</TE>
<TE>   Masry said during a break in the Superior Court proceedings that
Cohen's allegations are lies. He said that he gradually became aware
after hiring her that that she was "in over her head."</TE>
<TE>   He said he fired her after checking her background and learning
that she misrepresented herself as graduating "at the top of her
class" at Loyola Law School.</TE>
<TE>   Her ranking was nearer to the bottom of her class, Masry said.
"That does not get you $120,000 a year," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Masry said that Brockovich, the subject of a 2000 Hollywood film
that brought both her and Masry fame, will testify on his behalf to
rebut Cohen's allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen, the daughter of an eye surgeon, graduated from Duke
University at 17 and law school at 20. She seeks unspecified damages
in her suit.</TE>
<TE>   Masry said that in her final settlement offer before the trial,
she asked for $15 million.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Norm Watkins on Monday showed the jury a G-string
and a calendar with off-color jokes. Those were gifts Cohen gave
Masry at an office holiday party, just days before she was fired, he
said.</TE>

<HD>Riverside-L.A. Commute by Rail Cut to 90 Minutes</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>Rail commuters in Riverside County were greeted Monday with faster,
more direct service to Fullerton and Los Angeles on Metrolink's new
91 Line.</LD>
<LD>   Previously, Inland Empire commuters stopped at the Orange station
to switch trains to continue trips to Fullerton and Los Angeles. With
delays for connections and an added stop, the Riverside-Los Angeles
trip often took more than two hours each way. The new 91 Line will
get riders from Riverside to Los Angeles in about 90 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   "A lot of people have never tried [commuting by rail], perhaps
because it wasn't convenient," said Metrolink spokeswoman Sharon
Gavin. "Now this is an easier way to get in either direction."</LD>
<TE>   The 91 Line is Metrolink's first since 1995, when it opened the
Inland Empire-Orange County Line. The 91 Line will have 10 trains
each weekday, from Riverside Downtown and Union Station.</TE>
<TE>   Metrolink also announced that it is increasing service to
Oceanside and to its new station in Laguna Niguel/Mission Viejo. An
afternoon train from Los Angeles that previously stopped in San Juan
Capistrano will now go to Oceanside, and a morning Irvine-Union
Station train will now begin in Oceanside.</TE>
<TE>   Also, an evening train from Los Angeles will now continue to
Laguna Niguel instead of ending service in Irvine, and Laguna Niguel
will add an early-morning train to Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Holocaust Museum Imperiled</HD>
<DH>Collections: Already overshadowed by a well-financed rival,
the small, 41-year-old institution has had its budget slashed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Masha Loen had her share of close calls as a child--she was 14 when
Nazis yanked her out of a boxcar and tossed her into a concentration
camp, where her mother and two sisters were executed.</LD>
<LD>   Sixty years later she is facing another one: the threatened
closure of a museum she helped create to honor victims of the
Holocaust.</LD>
<LD>   Financial problems are jeopardizing the future of the Los Angeles
Museum of the Holocaust, the nation's oldest memorial of its type to
victims of Adolf Hitler's atrocities.</LD>
<TE>   The museum's paper-thin operating budget has been cut in half. And
volunteers and part-time employees who run it have been told it could
shut down by the end of the year if new financing isn't found.</TE>
<TE>   The museum at 6006 Wilshire Blvd. was established in 1961 by
Holocaust survivors as the "Martyrs Memorial Museum." Its artifacts,
photographs and exhibits starkly trace the tragic plight of Jews who
were seized and persecuted by Nazis during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   But since 1993 the modest museum has all but disappeared into the
shadows of its bigger and wealthier cousin, the high-tech, highly
promoted Museum of Tolerance, a few miles away at 9786 W. Pico Blvd.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas the glitzy, newer museum uses interactive and electronic
exhibits, the Museum of the Holocaust relies on more traditional
glass-case displays, photographic blowups and models arranged in a
ground-floor corner of a converted office building.</TE>
<TE>   The Holocaust museum has been kept afloat by the Los Angeles
Jewish Federation, an umbrella group for local Jewish organizations.</TE>
<TE>   That agency has had its own financing problems, however. Just as
it embarks on an emergency $10-million fund-raising campaign to help
Israel, the federation also is coping with $3million in cutbacks from
its own $43-million budget.</TE>
<TE>   The effect on the museum was immediate. Its operating budget was
slashed from last year's $120,000 to $60,000. In contrast, the museum
was allocated $189,000 in 1999-2000, according to its operators.</TE>
<TE>   "My fear is the museum will close. We're pretty darn close," said
Rachel Jagoda, its director, who is paid to work only 15 hours a
week. "Our rent is paid until December. If we can't raise our rent
for next year--$90,000--we're gone."</TE>
<TE>   Holocaust museum operators say they harbor no ill will against the
Museum of Tolerance. Operating on an $8-million annual budget, it is
run by the Simon Wiesenthal Center and has a paid staff of about 50.</TE>
<TE>   "They have an incredible educational program. It's a
youth-oriented museum," Jagoda said of the rival museum. "Ours is a
lot more historical in nature. But I think our problem is a lot of
people don't know we're even here."</TE>
<TE>   While the Museum of Tolerance has a $9 admission fee ($5.50 for
students), the Holocaust museum is free. About 500 schoolchildren a
month visit, compared with 1,000 students a day who tour the Museum
of Tolerance.</TE>
<TE>   "We like the intimate atmosphere here," said Sharon Gebhart, a
Venice High School teacher helping escort several dozen students
through the Museum of the Holocaust last month.</TE>
<TE>   Volunteer Harry Drotow of Park La Brea, whose father was a Nazi
prisoner, led the tour after youngsters discussed the Holocaust with
survivor Erika Jacoby, 73, of Valley Village.</TE>
<TE>   Tamara Aguilar, 16, cried as Jacoby spoke. "We'd read about the
Holocaust, but she really got to me," the 11th-grader said afterward.
"My ancestors went through slavery and were chained to boats. I'm
glad I met her."</TE>
<TE>   Jewish Federation officials say the museum's future could depend
on how it strengthens its connection with schools. It is important
"that the museum demonstrate there are a lot of kids going through
there and being touched by the program," said Michael Hirschfeld,
director of the federation's community relations committee.</TE>
<TE>   Hirschfeld said he said he hopes wealthy Holocaust survivors will
chip in and buy the Wilshire Boulevard building and donate it to the
museum.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some very comfortable people in the survivor community
who could make that museum take off," Hirschfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   Museum board of directors Chairman Dr. Gary Schiller, a
hematologist and oncologist at the UCLA Medical Center, said he is
looking for a $1-million endowment for the museum.</TE>
<TE>   "We think we cannot function with 1 1/2 employees. We cannot rely
on elderly volunteers," Schiller warned.</TE>
<TE>   If that is not possible, then officials might want to consider
moving the museum to the San Fernando or Conejo valley, "where you
have half the [Jewish] population" of the Los Angeles area, suggested
John Fishel, president of the federation.</TE>
<TE>   "Will you be successful reaching more people with two museums like
these in close proximity? I doubt it," Fishel said.</TE>
<TE>   But others think there is space for both the Holocaust museum and
the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles. Liebe Geft is one. She's the
director of the Museum of Tolerance.</TE>
<TE>   The Holocaust "truly warrants as many fine institutions as
possible," Geft said. "There's room for many more than two. This is a
very large metropolis. We encourage everyone to embrace the challenge
of teaching" and combating historical revisionists who claim that the
Nazi atrocities never took place.</TE>
<TE>   Those at the Holocaust museum agree.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a lot more modest than the Museum of Tolerance, but it
tells a story that must be told," said museum visitor Peter Rothholz,
an advertising executive who divides his time between homes in Santa
Monica and East Hampton, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, security guard Michael Aust--who is not Jewish--was
answering the phone and scheduling school tours between arranging
chairs and greeting visitors. He said the museum deserves to survive.</TE>
<TE>   "I see grown men leave here in tears," Aust said. "Teenagers come
in swaggering, and this place humbles them. They walk out of here
without the swagger."</TE>
<TE>   A nearby display case contains the only surviving photograph of
Masha Loen's family. Loen, of Valley Village, donated it after
helping lead a fund-raising campaign 20 years ago that helped pay for
the exhibits.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother and sisters died at the concentration camp at Stutthof.
It would be tragic, she said, for survivors' dreams of a permanent
memorial to die on Wilshire Boulevard.</TE>

<LD>A worker at a recycling plant was shot to death Monday, apparently by
robbers, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The man, whose name was not immediately released, was working at
CRT Inc. in the 10000 block of Knott Avenue when the shooting
occurred about 3 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   Two men in their 20s walked into the business, "and there was some
kind of confrontation with the employee there," said Lt. Jim
Amormino, a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department. The
man worked in an area where money was kept, he said.</LD>
<TE>   The robbers fled in a car driven by a woman in her 50s, police
said.</TE>
<TE>   Late Monday, officers had surrounded a house on Western Avenue
where one of the suspects may have been hiding.</TE>

<LD>A slow-moving brush fire scorched a half-acre of vegetation in
Anaheim Hills on Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators were looking into the cause of the fire, which
started about 3 p.m. in a field near Serrano Avenue and Canyon Rim
Road. Witnesses reported seeing juveniles in the area before the
fire.</LD>
<LD>   "Who knows what they were playing with out there?" said Maria
Sabol, a spokeswoman for the Anaheim Fire Department.</LD>
<TE>   About 50 firefighters took 45 minutes to contain the fire, which
caused only minor damage and involved no buildings. "We got a pretty
good handle on it pretty quickly," Sabol said.</TE>

<LD>Today's episode of stupid criminal tricks begins with two LAPD
officers observing a pair attempting to rob a shop. The suspects
notice them, make a run for it and are captured, reported the LAPD's
Blue Line newspaper. And what kind of a shop was it? Well, as the
newspaper quipped, "I guess these bandits forgot there are a few of
us who still hang out at Winchell's."</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Dum de dum dum: While we're on the subject, P. Chester Daley of
Porter Ranch heard this definition of a lawbreaker from the LAPD's
fictional Sgt. Joe Friday on a KNX radio rerun of "Dragnet": "Los
Angeles means city of the Angels. When an angel's halo slips, that's
where I come in. I carry a badge."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Moving on to spelling infractions: Joseph Granados of Oak View
writes: "I saw a sign on a telephone pole that read: 'Janet will you
merry me!'" Added Granados: "I didn't know if that was something of
an Elizabethan proposition or what...."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Almost like a life sentence: I spoke of how some hardy Dodger fans
had two chances to sing "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" during a recent
game--once during each seventh-inning stretch of a 14-inning game.
That reminded Joseph Clifford of Rancho Palos Verdes of a 16-inning
Dodger game that he attended. Clifford said the marathon inspired him
to come up with some special lyrics near the end of that night:</TE>
<TE>   Take me out of this ballgame, take me away from the park.</TE>
<TE>   I'm tired of peanuts and Crackerjacks, they don't care if I never
get back.</TE>
<TE>   So it's root, root, root for ... anyone.</TE>
<TE>   If this game won't end I will scream.</TE>
<TE>   So it's one, two, three strikes I'm away</TE>
<TE>   From this old ball game!</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sounds more like a dish for Joe Friday: Patricia Sullivan and E.A.
Condon Jr., both of Vista, came upon a killer ice cream dish (see
accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hey, mom deserves better! Steve Gabel of Long Beach noticed an
offer for a brunch this Sunday that seems likely to induce a hangover
(see photo).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of pain: Nothing tops the guillotine special spotted by
Barbara Wolff of Thousand Oaks a few years ago (see photo). A sure
way for an Angeleno to lose a halo.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fashion note: Over the years, I've received reports of street
people engaged in such unlikely activities as talking on a cell
phone, reading the Wall Street Journal and filling out an income tax
return. I didn't print the sightings because, well, I'm not sure I
could detect a street person by his or her outfit.</TE>
<TE>   Just the other day, Sue Lancaster of Rossmoor spoke
sympathetically of a shabbily dressed panhandler she saw. Retorted
her husband, Hal, an old college chum of mine: "Why, he doesn't look
any worse than Steve Harvey does!" You see my problem.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: The Huntington Beach Wave carried this police log
entry: "Golden West Street and Summit Avenue, traffic hazard: A
resident reported six to eight 'confused ducks' near McDonald's at
7:15 p.m." Maybe the quackers were wondering what happened to the
canceled 29-cent hamburger promotion.</TE>

<HD>Official Describes Rush to OK $95-Million Oracle Pact</HD>
<DH>Probe: Testimony comes on first day of hearings on deal,
approved with little study, no bidding.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO and NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- California lawmakers questioned the state's $95-million
computer contract with Oracle Corp. on Monday, hearing testimony from
an assortment of officials about how the state wound up making a
massive software purchase with no competitive bidding and little
study of whether it was needed.</LD>
<LD>   Cynthia Curry, a top attorney for the Department of General
Services, one of the state agencies that approved the deal, told
lawmakers that she was given the full Oracle contract to review the
day it was signed, and was so concerned about it that she went over
the head of her boss to complain.</LD>
<LD>   After the deal was signed, she recalled, General Services Director
Barry Keene got a call from Gov. Gray Davis' Cabinet secretary, Susan
Kennedy, to congratulate his "can-do agency" for getting the deal
done. Keene has since resigned, saying he should have scrutinized the
deal more closely.</LD>
<TE>   "I haven't seen a contract that had so many people pushing for it
in higher government," Curry said. However, she later added, "Nobody
told me Gov. Davis loves this contract or anything like that." And
the head of the State and Consumer Services Agency, where Curry said
she complained to another lawyer, said she never heard of Curry's
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Fraga-Decker, a former deputy in the Department of
Information Technology, the office at the center of the controversial
deal, told lawmakers she did not know that a consultant she helped
hire to advise the state on large-scale software deals later made
$28million on the Oracle contract until reading it in the newspaper.
The consultant, Logicon Inc., which now goes by the name of its
parent company Northrop Grumman, never completed its consulting work
for the state and was never compensated.</TE>
<TE>   And Deputy Finance Director Betty Yee testified that although her
department continued to have concerns about the contract until the
signing, it ultimately went along with the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's highly anticipated hearing started sluggishly, with
lawmakers debating the authority of their panel to fully investigate
the issue. A state audit found last month that state officials
approved the Oracle pact largely on an estimate from Logicon that it
would save the state up to $111 million, but auditors said the state
never independently verified that estimate, and they concluded the
deal would cost the state up to $41 million more than if it had never
happened.</TE>
<TE>   Republican lawmakers would like the probe to extend to the
governor's office following revelations that an Oracle lobbyist gave
a $25,000 campaign contribution meant for Davis to an administration
official days after the deal was signed. On Monday, the Republicans
demanded a sweeping list of information, from e-mails and video to
documents and memos. The request struck some Democrats as overly
broad.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon), in turn, publicly asked that the
review be followed to its full conclusion, regardless of whether it
loses its political sex appeal as the details become more mundane and
bureaucratic.</TE>
<TE>   "Because the focus is on politics," lawmakers often "miss the far
more serious issue of corruption, which I think is endemic in this
state," Peace said.</TE>
<TE>   A number of other top officials were expected to testify Monday
evening, including Department of Information Technology Director
Elias Cortez, who was suspended by Davis last week as details of the
deal unfolded. Also expected to testify was Debbie Leibrock, the
chief of a Finance Department team that reviews technology
investments and warned that state officials never examined Logicon's
savings claims.</TE>
<TE>   Cortez took copious notes while watching the testimony. In an
interview, he defended the type of agreement the state signed with
Oracle as a good way to save taxpayers money on software, but
conceded that California's first attempt at such a contract could
have been better handled.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obviously a learning situation for everybody," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cortez also denied he had ordered any documents shredded at the
Department of Information Technology. Davis dispatched the California
Highway Patrol to that office last week after reports of shredding.</TE>

<HD>Woman Seeks to Find Priest She Says Fathered Her Child</HD>
<DH>Abuse: Alleging she was impregnated by one of seven
clerics, she asks for cardinal's help.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A woman who alleges that she was made pregnant at the age of 16 by
one of seven Catholic priests who had sex with her 20 years ago said
Monday that she wants Cardinal Roger M. Mahony to help her daughter
identify which man is her father.</LD>
<LD>   Rita Milla said she was sexually abused by Father Santiago Tamayo
when she was attending St. Philomena Church in Carson. He allegedly
introduced her to six other priests who she said also seduced her.
When she became pregnant, she said, Tamayo sent her to the
Philippines, telling her parents she was studying there. Instead, she
secretly had the baby at Tamayo's brother's clinic.</LD>
<LD>   Mahony, who was released from the hospital Sunday after being
treated for blood clots in his lung, would not comment. But his
spokesman, Tod Tamberg, said the cardinal would be very open to
helping Milla identify the father of her daughter, who is 19.</LD>
<TE>   Tamberg said the archdiocese provided an annuity for the child
when she was born, but does not know how much was paid to the family.
Milla's parents learned of the child upon her return from the
Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   Tamberg said Mahony does not know where the accused priests are
located, nor does he know whether they are still in the priesthood.
Milla said she believes at least two of the men are dead.</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, Milla filed a lawsuit against the Los Angeles archdiocese
alleging fraud, clergy malpractice and conspiracy. Her attorney,
Gloria Allred, said the day the lawsuit was filed that "all seven
priests seemed to disappear from their parish offices." Allred said
she lost the lawsuit in the state Court of Appeal because the statute
of limitations had expired.</TE>
<TE>   In March 1991, Tamayo apologized face-to-face to Milla, telling a
news conference that he "had to go public and tell the whole truth. I
knew that cheap absolution would not undo the evil of the past. I had
her full trust and confidence, yet I got sexually involved with Rita.</TE>
<TE>   "Weakened by the sense of my own sins, I failed as a pastor to
rescue her from getting involved with the other priests."</TE>
<TE>   Tamayo has since died.</TE>
<TE>   Allred said she recently obtained letters that show Mahony was
paying Tamayo to remain in the Philippines for years after the baby
was born. Those letters were cited in a Los Angeles Superior Court
lawsuit filed last week alleging sexual abuse by another Los Angeles
archdiocese priest.</TE>
<TE>   In an August 1988 letter, then-Msgr. Thomas Curry told Tamayo he
was surprised to learn the priest was staying in the Los Angeles
area. The archdiocese "initiated salary payments to assist you while
you were pursuing the possibility of permanent settlement in the
Philippines," Curry wrote, saying that Tamayo was a liability to
himself, his family and the church. Copies of the letters were also
sent to Mahony.</TE>
<TE>   Allred said these letters indicated "a cover-up encouraged and
financed by the church in order to protect itself with callous
disregard for the rights of the victims."</TE>
<TE>   The payments were made public in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Tamberg acknowledged that the church paid Tamayo while he was in
Asia but said it was a salary, not payments to keep the scandal
quiet. "I don't see how that's a cover-up--telling someone to stay
away because of the liability they could cause by coming back here,"
Tamberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Milla's daughter, Jacqueline Milla, spoke in tears before
television cameras at a news conference Monday in Allred's law
office.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand that my biological father is a priest and that it is
uncertain who out of several priests he may be," she said. "I have
recently seen evidence that Cardinal Mahony knew of the whereabouts
of at least one of the priests. I am now asking that he reveal where
I may find my biological father.... Cardinal Mahony, please return my
father to me."</TE>
<TE>   Rita Milla appealed to Mahony to treat her daughter "with more
compassion and truth than they had for me."</TE>
<TE>   She said she only recently told her daughter about the priests'
abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "I never let her go to church--I didn't think it was a safe
place," Milla said.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles archdiocese, like many others around the country,
is facing lawsuits over allegations of past sexual abuse by priests.</TE>

<HD>Perez Given 2-Year Term in Federal Case</HD>
<DH>Court: The former Rampart officer gets the prison sentence
for framing a gang member whom he and his partner had shot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Los Angeles police officer Rafael Perez was sentenced to two
years in federal prison Monday for violating the civil rights of an
unarmed gang member who was shot by Perez and his partner and then
convicted on trumped-up charges.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Christina A. Snyder also placed Perez on three
years' probation after his release and ordered him to pay $246,392
restitution.</LD>
<LD>   But the judge rejected a defense request that she recommend his
assignment to a military-style boot camp for first-time offenders.
Assistant U.S. Atty. Mary Carter Andrues said such a recommendation
would be "inappropriate" under the circumstances.</LD>
<TE>   Perez, who sparked the Rampart police corruption investigation in
1999 after he was arrested for stealing cocaine from police evidence
lockers, declined an invitation to address the judge.</TE>
<TE>   His lawyer, Winston K. McKesson, said outside the courthouse that
his client "is happy to be putting all this behind him."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Andrues said: "It is important for the people of Los
Angeles and the justice system that Rafael Perez has finally been
held accountable for his civil rights violations."</TE>
<TE>   In a plea agreement reached with federal prosecutors last
December, the former Rampart anti-gang officer admitted that he and
his former partner, Nino Durden, conspired to fabricate evidence and
testimony against Javier Francisco Ovando.</TE>
<TE>   Ovando, an 18-year-old gang member, was shot in the head, shoulder
and hip on Oct. 12, 1996, when he walked into a vacant apartment west
of downtown where Perez and Durden were conducting surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   After realizing that Ovando was unarmed, the two officers planted
a short-barreled rifle beside him, claiming they fired in
self-defense.</TE>
<TE>   Ovando, who was left partially paralyzed from the shooting, was
subsequently tried, convicted and sentenced to more than 23 years in
state prison.</TE>
<TE>   The frame-up remained undetected until Perez was arrested for
stealing cocaine from LAPD evidence lockers.</TE>
<TE>   In a bid for leniency from the district attorney's office, he
disclosed his and Durden's role in the Ovando shooting. He also
implicated about 70 other Rampart officers in what he said was a
pattern of misconduct involving beatings, shootings and false
arrests.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of his allegations, more than 100 criminal
convictions, including Ovando's, were overturned.</TE>
<TE>   Ovando received a $15-million settlement from the city.</TE>
<TE>   More than a dozen LAPD officers resigned or were fired over
corruption-related allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Perez was sentenced to five years in prison for stealing cocaine,
but he was granted immunity from state prosecution for framing
Ovando. He served about three years of the state prison term before
being released last year.</TE>
<TE>   The deal did not protect him from federal prosecution, however.
Faced with a possible 15-year prison term on federal charges, Perez
negotiated a plea agreement with the U.S. attorney's office last
December.</TE>
<TE>   He admitted conspiring to violate Ovando's civil rights "by
fabricating evidence, falsely arresting and presenting false
testimony against him." He also acknowledged possessing a .22-caliber
semiautomatic rifle with obliterated serial numbers that he planted
beside the wounded Ovando.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange for a lighter sentence, Perez agreed to cooperate in
an ongoing federal probe of possible civil rights violations by LAPD
officers.</TE>
<TE>   The deal called for him to serve another two years behind bars.
However, each side retained the right to back out if the judge
departed from the proposed two-year term.</TE>
<TE>   Perez was to have been sentenced in March, but the proceedings
were delayed when a dispute unexpectedly arose between the U.S.
attorney's office and the federal probation office, which advises
judges on sentencing. The probation office recommended a 30- to
37-month sentence because of Perez's prior conviction and because he
lied during Ovando's criminal trial.</TE>
<TE>   Snyder indicated at the time that she was inclined to side with
the probation office. To resolve the matter, she asked defense and
prosecution lawyers to file further written arguments under seal.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the judge said she had decided to impose a two-year
sentence. "I do so," she said, "because the government urges that
accepting the agreement would be in the interest of justice."</TE>
<TE>   Snyder said the restitution payments will be used to cover the
costs of having tried Ovando in Los Angeles Superior Court and
housing him in county jail and state prison.</TE>
<TE>   Perez, who remains free on bail, was given 30 days to surrender to
authorities, but the judge said she would consider an extension
because he has been caring for his ailing mother, who lives in
another part of the country.</TE>
<TE>   Durden, his former partner, pleaded guilty last year to violating
the federal civil rights of Ovando and two other persons. He is
scheduled to be sentenced by Snyder on May 20.</TE>

<HD>Second Suit Names Costa Mesa Priest</HD>
<DH>Courts: Man alleges being sexually abused in 1978. Attorney
says the cleric denies molesting minors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A second accuser stepped forward Monday to file suit against a Costa
Mesa priest, alleging the cleric molested him more than 20 years ago
at a Northern California parochial school.</LD>
<LD>   A lawsuit filed last month accused the same Roman Catholic priest,
Father Jerome Henson, of molesting a boy at St. Dominic Church in
Benicia, Calif. The initial suit used an eyewitness police account of
one incident to corroborate the allegations.</LD>
<LD>   Henson's attorney, Gary Moorhead, said his client hadn't seen the
latest accusations, which were filed in Solano County Superior Court,
and has denied molesting any minors. Henson, the pastor of St. John
the Baptist Church in Costa Mesa, has been on paid leave since
November, when the initial allegations were brought to the Diocese of
Orange.</LD>
<TE>   Diocesan officials said there is no indication in Henson's
personnel file that he had a past molestation accusation when he
transferred to Orange in 1983. The diocese is not named in the suit.</TE>
<TE>   The second alleged victim, who sued under the pseudonym John Doe,
works as a scientist in the Bay Area and said he decided to come
forward after reading Henson's denials of sexual misconduct in the
media, said his attorney, Laurence E. Drivon.</TE>
<TE>   Now in his early 30s, he alleges that Henson molested him during a
single school year beginning in 1978. The priest would take him out
of his second-grade class and bring him to the rectory, where the
sexual abuse took place, according to the suit.</TE>
<TE>   On April 23, John Jacobs, now in state prison on a burglary
conviction, filed a suit accusing Henson of molesting him at St.
Dominic in the early 1980s. Jacobs used a police officer's eyewitness
account of one incident to bolster his allegations. A police sergeant
said he saw Jacobs and the priest in a compromising position at the
parish cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   After a short investigation, Henson was transferred out of state
to another parish.</TE>
<TE>   Henson is one of five Orange County priests in recent months to be
swept up in the nationwide Roman Catholic Church sex scandal. The
Orange diocese has about 285 priests.</TE>

information leading to the person behind a string of sexual assaults
dating back to 1996.</LD>

bag he had placed in the trash outside their house.</LD>
<TE>   Inside the bag, Frueh and Reno found photographs and videos of
naked women bound, gagged and bleeding. The men told police.</TE>

<LD>The city has paid $25,000 to a man who alleged an off-duty police
officer beat him during a confrontation at a local pizza restaurant.</LD>
<LD>   The July 2000 incident sparked one of two excessive-force
allegations leveled against Officer Edmond Kennedy within just 24
hours. A day later, a 17-year-old claimed Kennedy jumped on him and
threw him to the ground in response to a vulgar gesture.</LD>
<LD>   Kennedy has denied wrongdoing but acknowledged that police
supervisors disciplined him for his actions in both incidents.
Kennedy said he is appealing their decision.</LD>

<LD>A Santa Barbara man was convicted Monday of kidnapping a 15-year-old
West Hills boy, but found not guilty of killing him.</LD>
<LD>   After more than two days of deliberations, the jury found Jesse
Rugge, 22, guilty of kidnapping Nicholas Markowitz for ransom.
Nicholas, who was abducted from his San Fernando Valley home in
August 2000, was taken to Santa Barbara and shot to death two days
later.</LD>
<LD>   Rugge faces up to life in prison when sentenced June 4 by Santa
Barbara County Superior Court Judge William L. Gordon.</LD>
<TE>   Last November, a separate Santa Barbara jury convicted Ryan Hoyt,
22, of West Hills of killing Nicholas to avoid prosecution for
kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   The jury recommended the death penalty for Hoyt, who is awaiting
sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   Also charged with kidnapping and murder in the case are Graham
Pressley, 18, of Goleta and William Skidmore, 22, of Simi Valley.
They are awaiting trial in Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   During his trial, Rugge testified that Hoyt forced him and
Pressley to go to the campsite where Nicholas was shot, said Rugge's
attorney Michael A. Carty. He also testified that neither he nor
Pressley wanted Nicholas to die.</TE>

<LD>A Santa Barbara man was convicted Monday of kidnapping a 15-year-old
West Hills boy, but found not guilty of killing him.</LD>
<LD>   After more than two days of deliberations, the jury found Jesse
Rugge, 22, guilty of kidnapping Nicholas Markowitz for ransom.
Nicholas, who was abducted from his San Fernando Valley home in
August 2000, was taken to Santa Barbara and shot to death two days
later.</LD>
<LD>   Rugge faces up to life in prison when sentenced June 4 by Santa
Barbara County Superior Court Judge William L. Gordon.</LD>
<TE>   Last November, a separate Santa Barbara jury convicted Ryan Hoyt,
22, of West Hills of killing Nicholas to avoid prosecution for
kidnapping. The jury recommended the death penalty for Hoyt, who is
awaiting sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   Also charged with kidnapping and murder in the case are Graham
Pressley, 18, of Goleta and William Skidmore, 22, of Simi Valley.
They are awaiting trial in Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   During his trial, Rugge testified that he was in the van when
Nicholas was kidnapped, his attorney, Michael A. Carty, said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Rugge also told the jury that he was present when Hoyt shot
Nicholas nine times at a mountain campsite called Lizard's Mouth,
Carty said.</TE>
<TE>   But Rugge testified that Hoyt had forced him and Pressley to go to
the campsite, Carty said. He also testified that neither he nor
Pressley wanted Nicholas to die.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities allege that fugitive Jesse James Hollywood, 22,
orchestrated Nicholas' kidnapping and murder because the boy's
half-brother, Benjamin, 24, owed Hollywood $1,200.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas was held at Rugge's home in Santa Barbara for two days
before being moved to The Lemon Tree Inn on State Street, authorities
say.</TE>
<TE>   Rugge's father, Barron Rugge, a greenhouse manager at UC Santa
Barbara, has told The Times that he thought Nicholas was a guest of
his son. He said the boy showed no signs of being held against his
will.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Nicholas' parents settled a wrongful-death suit against
14 defendants, including Hollywood's parents, for nearly $350,000,
court documents show.</TE>

<LD>City leaders are looking for solutions after a rash of unrelated
weekend slayings left six young black men dead.</LD>
<LD>   "There are far too many African American men being killed in our
city," said City Manager Robert Bobb, who added Monday that the
city's black community should take more responsibility. "Our enemy is
inside us. It's not the KKK of years past. It's in us and we have to
rise up and take charge of our destiny."</LD>
<LD>   The weekend deaths bring the number of homicides in Oakland this
year to 37, which is 12 more than at the same time last year. The
city is on a pace to have more than 100 homicides this year, up from
87 last year.</LD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Opponents of a consumer financial privacy bill used nearly $5 million
in campaign cash to sink the measure in the final days of the
Assembly session last year, a watchdog group charged Monday.</LD>
<LD>   At stake in pending legislation was how easily consumers could
block financial and insurance companies from sharing private consumer
information, according to California Common Cause.</LD>
<LD>   During the 2000 election cycle and nine months last year when a
bill limiting dissemination of the information was being considered,
opponents gave $2.6 million to Assembly members, $1.3 million to
senators and more than $800,000 to Gov. Gray Davis, the group said.</LD>
<TE>   But insurance and financial companies gave to many supporters of
the bill, including the author, as well as to opponents, said Dan
Dunmoyer of the Personal Insurance Federation of California.</TE>

<HD>N. Hollywood High 6th at Science Bowl</HD>
<DH>Knowledge: The defending champions are bested in three days
of national competition in Washington.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Defending champions North Hollywood High School finished sixth Monday
after three days of competition at the National Science Bowl in
Washington, D.C.</LD>
<LD>   Virginia's Thomas Jefferson High School for Science &amp; Technology
took first place, Boulder High School in Colorado came in second and
Mission San Jose High School finished third.</LD>
<LD>   "We had some excellent teams out there," said North Hollywood
senior Julia Hu. "They were really fast, and I think we encountered a
lot of bad luck."</LD>
<TE>   The competition began Saturday with a round-robin session in which
North Hollywood won five matches and lost one. The school had
previously gone undefeated in the first round for four years in a row
at the national bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to pick up the pieces and start over again," said North
Hollywood coach Len Soloff. "You have to be positive, though there's
a part of me that's really sad. It was fun, and hopefully we will be
back next year."</TE>
<TE>   The first-round loss meant North Hollywood had to win all
subsequent matches to repeat as champions. In the second round of a
double-elimination tournament, they lost to Mission San Jose and
Thomas Jefferson, which dominated the competition.</TE>
<TE>   "That deflated our egos," Hu said.</TE>
<TE>   Sixty-four teams competed in the 11th annual competition. Students
are tested in a game-show format in which they must sound a buzzer
before answering a question. Speed is the key to victory, Soloff
said.</TE>
<TE>   For seniors like Hu, it was difficult to accept that the games
were over.</TE>
<TE>   "I've put three years into [science bowl] so I'm kind of sad," Hu
said. "I'm going to be nostalgic and suffering from buzzer
withdrawal."</TE>
<TE>   North Hollywood placed fourth in 2000 and second in 1999 and 1998.</TE>

<HD>14-Year-Old Girl With Knife Is Shot by Police</HD>
<DH>Disturbance: The teen allegedly lunged at an officer
inside her Ventura foster home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An emotionally troubled 14-year-old girl armed with a large kitchen
knife was shot three times in the abdomen after she allegedly lunged
at a police officer inside the Ventura home she shares with her
foster parents.</LD>
<LD>   The teenager was shot about 10:30 p.m. Sunday in her Opal Avenue
home by one of five officers who responded to a 911 call from her
foster father, Ventura Police Sgt. Brock Avery said.</LD>
<LD>   The girl was listed in stable condition late Monday at Ventura
County Medical Center.</LD>
<TE>   "A call came into the Police Department that the girl was out of
control in the house, and she had armed herself with a kitchen
knife," Avery said. "She was walking around the kitchen, not so much
yelling but not cooperating." The foster parents "had confronted her
earlier in the night about not following the house rules."</TE>
<TE>   The girl's foster father, Robert Worthley, his wife, Zaida, and
five other foster children left the house after the shooting and were
staying at a Ventura hotel Monday. They were unavailable for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Cristy Crawford, the couple's adult daughter, questioned the
methods used by officers. "I think the force used was not necessary,"
she said as she left her parents' home Monday morning on her way to
the hotel. "She is a child and she is very frail."</TE>
<TE>   Crawford said the girl was born in China and had moved in with the
Worthleys less than a month ago after living in foster homes outside
of Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   Officer Kristin Rupp, 23, who shot the girl, was placed on paid
administrative leave pending an investigation. Rupp joined the
department last year.</TE>
<TE>   Two officers specially trained in dealing with the mentally ill
were on the scene at the time of the shooting, but events unfolded
before they could get involved, Avery said.</TE>
<TE>   Officers said the situation developed so rapidly they were left
with no other choice but to shoot. County mental health specialists
who are part of the county's Crisis Intervention Team arrived just
after the shooting, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   When officers arrived at the house, they spoke briefly with Robert
Worthley in the frontyard, Avery said. Worthley said he put his wife
and other foster children in a back bedroom and locked the door for
protection.</TE>
<TE>   Two officers who initially responded to the call were joined by
three others, including the two with recent mental health training,
Avery said.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after, the officers entered the two-story home.</TE>
<TE>   One officer confronted the girl at the bottom of a stairway and
opened fire when the teenager, holding a knife, got within 6 feet of
her, Avery said. "The officer who did the shooting saw the girl and
told her to stop and put down the knife, which she didn't do," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting comes a month after a deadly confrontation between
Ventura detectives and a 19-year-old car-theft suspect in the parking
lot of a Thompson Boulevard motel. Randy Reeves of Ventura died of a
gunshot wound to the chest after he allegedly pulled a knife on an
officer during a fight.</TE>
<TE>   Officers from Ventura and other cities in Ventura County have been
going through a mental health training course since December. About
150 police officers are expected to complete the training this year.</TE>
<TE>   The course is designed to teach officers communication skills to
help defuse situations such as the one that occurred Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   But the training doesn't fit every situation, said Dr. Michael
Ferguson, acting medical director for the Ventura County Department
of Behavioral Health.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope to avoid these situations as much as possible, but
sometimes things can happen," said Ferguson, who helped design the
course's 100-page training manual. "We have to realize that it comes
to the point where an officer is directly threatened and they have to
protect the public and themselves. You can't always avoid a tragedy."</TE>
<TE>   County officials said the girl had spent time in recent months at
Casa Pacifica, a nonprofit board and care home in Camarillo that
cares for neglected and abused children.</TE>
<TE>   Others who work with foster children in Ventura County described
the Worthleys as a model foster-care family.</TE>
<TE>   "The Worthleys are a widely respected foster couple," said Ted
Myers, director of the county Department of Children and Family
Services. "This is a tragic situation. The Worthleys are respected
for their ability to handle difficult children."</TE>
<TE>   Myers said 30% to 40% of the nearly 800 foster children in Ventura
County have been diagnosed with severe emotional problems.</TE>

<HD>George Sidney, 86; Directed MGM Musicals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>George Sidney, among the last surviving directors of MGM's beloved
Technicolor musicals of the 1940s and early '50s, died Sunday of
lymphoma at his Las Vegas home. He was 86.</LD>
<LD>   At his side were his wife, Corinne Entratter Sidney, and his
stepson, Ben.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to becoming the master of lighthearted entertainment,
Sidney directed such Academy Award-winning short subjects as "Quicker
'n' a Wink" and "Of Pups and Puzzles" in the early 1940s, and was the
longest-serving head of the Directors Guild of America.</LD>
<TE>   Sidney, who retired from directing in 1968, was warm and charming,
but so unwilling to call attention to himself that his adoring public
knew him only through his movies they loved--musicals such as
"Anchors Aweigh," "Annie Get Your Gun," "The Harvey Girls," "Kiss Me
Kate" and "Show Boat;" swashbucklers such as "Scaramouche" and "The
Three Musketeers;" and the Esther Williams aquacades "Bathing Beauty"
and "Thrill of a Romance."</TE>
<TE>   At one point in his stellar, 29-feature career, Sidney had 15 box
office hits in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Howard Keel, who starred in Sidney's "Annie Get Your Gun," "Kiss
Me Kate" and "Show Boat," reached at his home in Palm Springs, called
Sidney "a wonderful, wonderful man, a great director with the camera,
which he knew in and out. He was very kind to me when I needed
kindness...."</TE>
<TE>   Kathryn Grayson, echoing her "Kiss Me Kate" and "Show Boat"
co-star, said: "George could do with the camera things that nobody
else could do. He did my first screen test when I was a teenager and
was wearing high heels for the first time. He was so great with me,
and I was a good friend to him through all three wives."</TE>
<TE>   Novelist and screenwriter Sidney Sheldon, who adapted "Annie Get
Your Gun" for the screen, remembered Sidney as "a gentle man--and a
gentleman, an absolute pleasure to work with. He was a giant."</TE>
<TE>   "He was Mr. MGM," Sidney's friend Robert Stack told a Las Vegas
newspaper. "He was the best. God knows his credits certainly prove
it."</TE>
<TE>   Sidney's interests and accomplishments extended far beyond his
flair for light, lively entertainment. At 34, he became the youngest
president of the Directors Guild, serving longer than anyone else,
from 1951 to 1959 and 1961 to 1967.</TE>
<TE>   For steering the guild through the bleak years of the Hollywood
blacklist era, Sidney received a unique gold medal, and in 1998
became the first recipient of the guild's president's award.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of the anti-Communist hysteria of the '50s, Sydney told a
Times reporter in 1986, "I was called a Communist by some people and
a reactionary by others. Someone called my father and said, 'What
happened to your son? Did you know he was a Communist?' My father
said, 'My son is a Communist? Three Rolls-Royces and he's a
Communist?'"</TE>
<TE>   Current guild President Martha Coolidge said in a statement
Monday: "The Directors Guild is extremely saddened by the passing of
our former president George Sidney. His distinguished career as a
director, along with his years of service and dedication to the DGA,
were an inspiration to us all. He will be greatly missed."</TE>
<TE>   Born into show business in New York, Sidney was the son of Hazel
Mooney, of vaudeville's headlining Mooney Sisters, and Lewis Sidney,
an executive with Loews Inc., parent company of MGM.</TE>
<TE>   He was only 5 when he took the title role in the 1921 Tom Mix
western "The Littlest Cowboy." Sidney went to work as an MGM
messenger boy when he was still in his teens.</TE>
<TE>   But he was soon directing shorts, including the "Little Rascals"
series and, by the age of 20, scores of screen tests. Among those who
stepped from Sidney's tests into major careers were--other than
Grayson--Barry Fitzgerald, Ava Gardner, Donna Reed, Ann Sheridan and
Van Heflin.</TE>
<TE>   By putting them in star-turn roles, he also played a crucial role
in the careers of such leading ladies as Ann-Margret and Esther
Williams.</TE>
<TE>   In 1937, Sidney directed an experimental 3-D short, and in 1953 he
directed one of the best 3-D features, "Kiss Me Kate," starring Keel,
Grayson and, in one of her best roles, Ann Miller.</TE>
<TE>   He was a pioneer in combining live action with animation, using it
to depict Alfalfa's grumbling stomach in a "Little Rascals" short
and, more famously, in having Gene Kelly dance with Jerry the Mouse
in "Anchors Aweigh."</TE>
<TE>   That led Sidney to financing and helping to found Hanna-Barbera
Productions in 1944, serving as its president for a decade.</TE>
<TE>   In the '50s, with MGM's golden era over, Sidney became head of
production for Harry Cohn at Columbia, where he directed "Pal Joey,"
"Jeanne Eagels" and "The Eddie Duchin Story."</TE>
<TE>   During bomb testing after World War II, Sidney was assigned by the
Air Force to supervise the Atomic Energy Commission Film Program at
Eniwetok Island.</TE>
<TE>   His work in using film to illuminate heart functions and diseases
earned his first honorary doctorate, from Hahnemann Medical College
in 1954. His latest honorary doctoral degree will be presented to his
widow in June by the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, where he had
recently lectured.</TE>
<TE>   In retirement, Sidney pursued interests in paleontology and art
history and earned a law degree at USC. A gifted photographer, he
shot more than a million photos, many featuring his stars, including
Judy Garland, Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra.</TE>
<TE>   Sidney's marriage to drama coach Lillian Burns ended in divorce.
He then married his close friend Edward G. Robinson's widow, Jane,
and lived with her in Robinson's Beverly Hills mansion until moving
to Las Vegas. Upon her death in 1991, he married Corinne Entratter,
whom he had known since she was the wife of his good friend, the late
Jack Entratter, president and entertainment director of the Sands
Hotel in Las Vegas. Corinne Entratter appeared in Sidney's film "The
Swinger," starring Ann-Margret.</TE>
<TE>   Sidney's final weeks were marked by visits and phone calls from
friends and colleagues, ranging from Bobby Rydell to Tony Curtis. On
the road with the musical version of "Some Like It Hot," Curtis
called him nightly to chat in Hungarian, the language of their
fathers. Singer Phyllis McGuire regularly read him Scripture at his
bedside.</TE>
<TE>   At the Mayo Clinic's Scottsdale, Ariz., branch, Sidney refused the
surgery or chemotherapy that might extend his life by two months.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in show business, we know how the script ends," he told his
doctors and his wife.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want a funeral," Sidney told his wife. Self-effacing to
the end, he said, "I've been to too many funerals, and I don't want
anybody to lose a day's work on account of me."</TE>

<HD>City Rec Leader Held in Alleged Molestations</HD>
<DH>Crime: The Newport Beach employee, 31, is accused of
sucking the toes of 45 boys. He has pleaded not guilty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN and STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To the parents and children involved in Newport Beach's after-school
recreation programs, Trenton Veches was a dedicated leader.</LD>
<LD>   The 31-year-old city employee organized events at parks and on
weekends helped referee basketball games. He was known for
encouraging kids to do their best and for ensuring the teams were
balanced so everyone would play.</LD>
<LD>   Then, a few weeks ago, a co-worker said he saw Veches crouched in
front of a boy, sucking one of the child's toes.</LD>
<TE>   Detectives launched an investigation and now allege that Veches
sucked the toes of more than 40 children, videotaping many of the
incidents. Veches is being held at the Orange County Jail on $500,000
bail and faces multiple counts of child molestation. Veches pleaded
not guilty and told the city last week he was resigning.</TE>
<TE>   The case has left parents and athletes alike feeling a mixture of
disbelief and betrayal.</TE>
<TE>   "For somebody who lives in a safe little community, this is all it
takes for me to be shattered," said Charlotte Baca, who has a
10-year-old son in the basketball program at Mariners Park.</TE>
<TE>   Baca and others said Veches seemed like a good influence on the

They said they trusted him because he was a city employee.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids seemed to enjoy him and were always flocking around him.
The parents thought he was very fair," Baca said. "You do build a
certain confidence, and we all believed we were in a safe community.
[The accusations] are horrifying and disturbing."</TE>
<TE>   Hired in August 1998, Veches supervised employees who ran the
Community Services Department's youth recreation programs. City
Manager Homer Bludau said Newport Beach had conducted a background
check on Veches before he was hired.</TE>
<TE>   Police believe the incidents occurred over a two-year period at
the Mariners Branch Library and at two other community centers that
Veches oversaw.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives searched his house and allegedly found a digital camera
loaded with images of Veches sucking the toes of 45 partially clad
children, all boys between the ages of 6 and 10 years old, Sgt. Steve
Shulman said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's different when a parent sucks on their 3-year-old's toe or
fingers," Shulman said. "When the person is doing it for sexual
[arousal], that's illegal."</TE>
<TE>   Although the allegations do not involve rape or fondling of sexual
organs, authorities considered them extremely serious, said Orange
County Assistant Dist. Atty. Rosanne Froeberg.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the multiplicity of victims, the surrounding circumstances
and his position as an administrator," she said. "Those kinds of
things, given the predatory aspect of his behavior, are a concern."</TE>
<TE>   Under California law, child molestation is any touching of a child
for sexual gratification, Froeberg said. Still, it's possible that a
toe fetish may not result in as harsh a sentence, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at it, it does not have the same psychological
trauma as your classic child molest," Froeberg said. "It's a
different type of sexual molestation, and that is definitely
something that will be a consideration when we're talking about what
type of sentence is imposed."</TE>
<TE>   The city is providing counseling for children and parents.</TE>
<TE>   But parents such as Baca said it will take a while to restore
trust. "I didn't have a problem with my children coming and going,
but now I have to rethink activities they're involved in," she said.</TE>

<HD>Rec Leader Held in Sucking of Boys' Toes</HD>
<DH>Crime: The arrest of a popular city employee on molestation
charges unsettles the Newport Beach community.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To the parents and children involved in Newport Beach's after-school
recreation programs, Trenton Veches was a dedicated leader.</LD>
<LD>   The 31-year-old city employee organized events at parks and on
weekends helped referee basketball games. He was known for
encouraging kids to do their best and for ensuring the teams were
balanced so everyone would play.</LD>
<LD>   Then, a few weeks ago, a co-worker said he saw Veches crouched in
front of a boy, sucking one of the child's toes.</LD>
<TE>   Detectives launched an investigation and now allege that Veches
sucked the toes of more than 40 children, videotaping many of the
incidents. Veches is being held at the Orange County Jail on $500,000
bail and faces multiple counts of child molestation. Veches pleaded
not guilty and told the city last week he was resigning.</TE>
<TE>   The case has left parents and athletes alike feeling a mixture of
disbelief and betrayal.</TE>
<TE>   "For somebody who lives in a safe little community, this is all it
takes for me to be shattered," said Charlotte Baca, who has a
10-year-old son in the basketball program at Mariner's Park. "I have
to rethink ... how I let my children participate in community
activities--whether I attend with them."</TE>
<TE>   Baca and others said Veches seemed like a good influence on the
children, noting that as a referee he was known for being judicious.
They said they trusted him because he was a city employee.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids seemed to enjoy him and were always flocking around him.
The parents thought he was very fair," Baca said. "You do build a
certain confidence, and we all believed we were in a safe community.
[The accusations] are horrifying and disturbing."</TE>
<TE>   Hired in August 1998, Veches supervised employees who ran the
Community Services Department's youth recreation programs. City
manager Homer Bludau said Newport Beach had conducted a background
check on Veches before he was hired and found no arrests or record of
inappropriate behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Police believe the incidents occurred over a two-year period at
the Mariners Branch Library and at two other community centers that
Veches oversaw.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives searched his house and allegedly found a digital camera
loaded with images of Veches sucking the toes of 45 partially clad

Shulman said.</TE>

<HD>Reservists Ousted From Training</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Los Angeles Police Department reserve officers say there wasn't
much tolerance shown them when they showed up for a "Tools for
Tolerance for Law Enforcement" training program last week.</LD>
<LD>   The two contend they were humiliated when they were kicked out
halfway through an eight-hour seminar at the Museum of Tolerance
because their $200 seminar fees had not been paid.</LD>
<LD>   The state-funded program has taught tolerance to about 42,000
police officers and civilian police department employees for five
years.</LD>
<TE>   But more than 200 Los Angeles police reservists, who work as
patrol officers, are not covered by the funding. Reserve officers
Gary Becker and Jon Zvi discovered that when they took a day off from
their civilian jobs for the tolerance training.</TE>
<TE>   "In the middle, they tapped us on the shoulder and said we have to
leave. I thought it was part of the training exercise, to teach us
how we'd feel if we were discriminated against," said Becker, 47, an
Agoura Hills parts distributor who has worked as a West Valley
Division patrol officer since 1978.</TE>
<TE>   "But we weren't invited back in--they escorted us to the lobby. I
asked if it was a joke, and they said no, they weren't getting paid
for us to be there so we had to leave. It was totally embarrassing,
getting kicked out of the Museum of Tolerance. They treated us like
kids who snuck in the back of the theater to watch the movie for
free."</TE>
<TE>   Line reserve officers are unpaid but are trained as officers and
carry weapons and make arrests. They are required to meet the same
continuing-education requirements as regular officers. The tolerance
training is certified by the state and counts toward the 24 hours of
continuing education required every two years.</TE>
<TE>   Puzzled police officials who were investigating the funding snafu
Monday said the reservists were apparently placed on the wrong
training list by a department clerk.</TE>
<TE>   Museum program coordinator Sunny Lee said reserve police officers
are "not in the category of reimbursable" under the state plan and
cannot be invited in for training with regular officers and
civilians, such as fingerprint technicians and file clerks.</TE>
<TE>   But the pair's ouster "was deeply regrettable and a definite
mistake.... I'm not making any excuses whatsoever," said Liebe Geft,
director of the Museum of Tolerance. She said a scaled-down free
program is scheduled for June 2.</TE>
<TE>   But Becker said he and Zvi, a 60-year-old Woodland Hills
businessman in civilian life, won't be there. Still irritated by the
incident, Becker said he can't help but note one irony: Both officers
are Jewish.</TE>
<TE>   "And Jon's mother is a Holocaust survivor," Becker said. "Jon
could teach that program about tolerance."</TE>

<LD>Responding to concerns about relocating a gathering spot for day
laborers, the Thousand Oaks City Council will hold a second public
discussion on the issue tonight.</LD>
<LD>   The city proposes spending up to $50,000 to improve a strip of
land it owns on Royal Oaks Drive, next to the Ventura Freeway, to
create a new meeting site for laborers and the contractors who hire
them. The greenbelt would have picnic tables and a portable toilet.</LD>
<LD>   Several nearby property owners and tenants complained they didn't
know the council discussed the matter March 18 and felt they were
denied a chance to comment.</LD>
<TE>   The meeting begins at 6 p.m. at 2100 Thousand Oaks Blvd.</TE>

<HD>Seismic Work at John Wayne Means 800 Fewer Parking Spots</HD>
<DH>Airport: Two western garages are being reinforced in the
yearlong project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hundreds of parking spots will be temporarily lost over the next year
at John Wayne Airport as construction crews reinforce a pair of
four-story parking structures as part of a $2.9-million,
earthquake-safety project.</LD>
<LD>   The work at the airport's western parking garages, which began
Monday, will advance in phases, with two floors at a time closed for
12 weeks. Parking will be permitted on the remaining floors, in the
airport's eastern garages and in an overflow lot just north of the
airport.</LD>
<LD>   The parking structures were designed in 1990 to withstand a major
earthquake, airport manager Alan Murphy said. However, state and
federal earthquake standards were changed after the 1994 Northridge
earthquake.</LD>
<TE>   "What we're trying to do is maintain a facility that even after a
major earthquake wouldn't collapse and still would be able to
operate," Murphy said. "Obviously, we can't do all the work at once."</TE>
<TE>   The work involves wrapping concrete columns with fiber. The first
half of the work--to be completed in mid-October--affects parking for
Alaska, American, Continental and Delta airline passengers. The
second half, to be completed by next April, will affect America West,
Aloha, Northwest, Southwest, United and US Airways passengers.</TE>
<TE>   The airport's bridges are to be seismically upgraded after the
work on the western garages is completed. The eastern parking garages
were retrofitted in 1999. The terminal, itself, needs minor work,
Murphy said.</TE>
<TE>   The parking crunch should hit heaviest during midweek, when the
structures usually are full. There are 5,839 spaces along the sides
of the terminal. About 800 spaces will be closed at a time.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy said the seismic work is unrelated to problems that
surfaced in one of the western parking structures before the terminal
opened in 1990, part of a $310-million expansion of the airport.</TE>
<TE>   Inspectors discovered hundreds of cracks in a garage, built by a
contractor who was fired by supervisors after an eight-month delay
and his failure to renew a required permit. The cracks--which
appeared on ramps, floors and on columns supporting the four-level
garage--weren't considered a structural weakness at the time.</TE>
<TE>   On the top deck of the garage, concrete had to be torn out and
replaced because it was poured after it had partially hardened.
Executives with Taylor Woodrow Inc., which built the structures,
blamed the cracks on a faulty design. A second contractor completed
the repair work.</TE>
<TE>   Lawsuits filed against Taylor Woodrow and by Taylor Woodrow
against the county were settled in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   The county agreed to pay the company $9.6 million-- about
one-third the amount Taylor Woodrow and its subcontractors wanted to
complete the job.</TE>

<HD>School Parking Scofflaws Caught on Tape</HD>
<DH>Traffic officers armed with video cameras focus on safety
at 85 campuses in a fast-growing city enforcement program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michelle Nealy was dropping off her 11-year-old son at John Burroughs
Middle School in Los Angeles a few months ago when she noticed two
adults operating video cameras from the nearby sidewalks.</LD>
<LD>   "My first response was: Why are these people videotaping these
kids?" she said.</LD>
<LD>   A few weeks later, when Nealy received two parking tickets in the
mail, she realized the cameras were not trained on the children.</LD>
<TE>   The cameras, wielded by Los Angeles parking officers, were
collecting evidence against Nealy and other motorists who were
dropping children off at the school.</TE>
<TE>   One of the cameras got unflattering images of Nealy illegally
stopping in a red zone and later blocking a driveway. "I was very
upset," Nealy said, fuming.</TE>
<TE>   She is not alone.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Department of Transportation's video crackdown is
one of the city's fastest-growing parking enforcement programs,
expanding from eight schools at its inception in 1998 to 85 schools
today.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the city's 12 camera-wielding officers produced 18,900
citations, generating nearly $700,000 in fines for the city's
coffers. City transportation officials hope to add four cameras and
several more officers in the next few months.</TE>
<TE>   The program's growth has been spurred by the demands of school
administrators, who face ever-increasing traffic and parking problems
at the start and end of each school day.</TE>
<TE>   Most students in the Los Angeles Unified School District already
ride to school with mom or dad. The parking problems grew worse in
April as even more parents drove students to school during the bus
drivers' strike.</TE>
<TE>   The chaotic scene at the start and end of each school day can have
deadly results.</TE>
<TE>   In March, two young girls were killed outside an Anaheim school
when a car jumped a curb and crushed them against a wall near a
congested pickup and drop-off zone.</TE>
<TE>   City officials hope the video enforcement program will help
minimize such deaths in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "Every study will tell you that if you don't enforce the laws, you
won't get the level of compliance that you need to keep people safe,"
said Philip Recht, a Los Angeles city transportation commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   In the past when school administrators and parking officers tried
to confront parents about illegal parking, tempers would flare and
ugly altercations would erupt within earshot of schoolchildren.</TE>
<TE>   The video program claims several advantages: Most violators don't
know they have been cited until weeks later, thus eliminating many
face-to-face confrontations. The videotape evidence is nearly
irrefutable. Plus, a single video camera can document dozens of
violations in the time it takes a parking officer to write up a
single citation by hand.</TE>
<TE>   But many parents who have been caught on the candid cameras aren't
smiling. Instead of handing out tickets, these parents suggest that
city and school officials build driveways and loading zones to make
it easier for them to deliver children to and from school.</TE>
<TE>   "What we need in front of the school is a place to drop the kids
off," said Alan Ehrlich, who has been cited twice by the
camera-toting officers while taking his son to Hale Middle School in
Woodland Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at that school say they have studied the parking
problem, but don't have the money or real estate to make the needed
fixes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a concern of ours as well," said Assistant Principal
Larry Meyer. "But there is nothing we can do."</TE>
<TE>   The front entrance of Hale Middle School faces Califas Street, a
narrow, two-lane residential road.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Tuesday morning, the scene in front of the school made
a three-ring circus look orderly. Minivans, sedans, station wagons
and SUVs were bumper to bumper, filling the street in both directions
for several blocks. Children darted in between traffic, racing to
beat the school's opening bell.</TE>
<TE>   Standing on opposite sides of the street, Frances Rivera, a
15-year veteran parking officer, and Tony Yancey, a six-year veteran,
scanned the chaotic scene with handheld video cameras.</TE>
<TE>   For the two officers, catching parking scofflaws was like shooting
fish in a barrel.</TE>
<TE>   Rivera turned her camera to a Volvo that stopped in a bus loading
zone to deliver two youngsters to school. A few seconds later, a Ford
Expedition and a BMW pulled into the same bus zone to unload
students.</TE>
<TE>   Rivera then swung her camera around to a Buick that had just
stopped at a red curb to let out a young girl. Seconds later, she
trained the camera on a Chevrolet pickup truck that pulled in front
of a driveway to let two children out. Both ran across the busy
street only a few yards from a marked crosswalk.</TE>
<TE>   A few seconds later, a woman in a Toyota Camry pulled in front of
the same driveway to drop off a young girl. As the car pulled away
from the curb, the driver spotted Rivera aiming the camera in her
direction.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you get a picture of me?" the Camry driver asked through an
opened passenger window.</TE>
<TE>   Rivera nodded.</TE>
<TE>   "Why?" the woman asked.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't block the driveway, ma'am," Rivera responded.</TE>
<TE>   The woman shrugged and drove off, perhaps resigned to the fact
that she had been caught on tape in the act.</TE>
<TE>   But other parents have not given in so easily.</TE>
<TE>   Yancey said he has been the target of curses and rude gestures
hurled by parents whose misdeeds were captured on camera.</TE>
<TE>   "I was at Riverside Drive Elementary [in Sherman Oaks] last week
and this woman was cursing me out with her kids right there in the
car," he said, shaking his head in disbelief.</TE>
<TE>   Nealy, an auditor from Los Angeles, never refuted that she had
parked illegally in front of her son's school in December.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, she appealed her parking tickets by questioning the
legality of the program.</TE>
<TE>   In her appeal, Nealy noted that state law requires local officials
to post signs that warn motorists when cameras are used to catch
motorists who fail to stop at red lights.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts say parking officials who want to use video cameras
to catch scofflaws are not required to post warning signs.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, there are no legal procedures required for the use of
cameras for this type of traffic enforcement, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there is a constitutional problem," said Eugene
Volokh, a constitutional law professor at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Still, city officials said they warn parents by sending notices
home with students. Nealy claims she never received a notice and
objects to anyone relying on schoolchildren to deliver such warnings.</TE>
<TE>   Nealy won her appeal--on a technicality. An adjudication officer
waived her citations because a parking officer had included
inaccurate information about Nealy's car registration.</TE>
<TE>   Nealy suspects her tickets were forgiven to keep her quiet.</TE>
<TE>   But she said she won't keep quiet. Nealy complains that the
program has generated plenty of money for the city, but has not
changed the chaotic parking scene at her son's school.</TE>
<TE>   "If you come by the school now," she said, "the same thing is
still happening."</TE>

<HD>We Are Failing the Children of the World</HD>
<DH>Of the 100 born in the next 24 seconds, many will face a
bleak future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL BELLAMY</AU>
<BD>Carol Bellamy is the executive director of UNICEF. Web
site: www.unicef.org.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every 24 seconds 100 babies are born around the world. That is 100
infants whose futures are in our hands.</LD>
<LD>   Fortunately, we know exactly how to ensure that they grow up
healthy, educated and able to reach their full potential as adults.
Sadly, we also know that we are failing these children. Far too many
of them die from preventable diseases, never enter a classroom, are
terrorized by violence and conflict and are forced to work, often in
abusive conditions.</LD>
<LD>   To better understand the overall condition of the world's
2.1billion children, let us take a closer look at the 100 children
born in about the time it took to read the previous sentences. Some
of the following figures will shock, others will surprise. But many
of them, sadly, will be all too recognizable.</LD>
<TE>   The geographic dispersion of these 100 children is heavily skewed.
More than half are Asian, with almost 20 of them born in one country:
India. Only eight of them were born in the industrialized world. Most
will live longer than ever before, an average of 64 years. In the
industrialized world, that age rises to 78 years, while in the parts
of Africa most heavily affected by HIV/AIDS, it plunges to less than
40 years.</TE>
<TE>   Disease and ill health will plague a huge proportion of these 100.
Almost 27 will not be immunized against preventable childhood
illnesses, such as measles. And almost 20 won't have access to clean
drinking water. By age 5, 32 will have suffered from malnutrition. Of
the 100, 18 of them will not ever go to school, and 20 more will not
reach the fifth grade.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, lack of schooling is the handmaiden of child labor.
Once they are old enough--which can mean as young as 5--nearly 25 of
the 100 will be working. Of those who do become laborers, there's a
50% chance that they will work full-time. Of those born in Africa,
almost 40% will work between the ages of 5 and 14.</TE>
<TE>   Many of these dispiriting figures come from the 2001 U.N. report
"We the Children," which documents and analyzes the most
comprehensive statistics ever gathered on the status of children. It
was born out of the 1990 U.N. World Summit for Children, during which
world leaders gathered for the first time to commit to concrete
actions on behalf of children. This week, 60 heads of state or
government and 170 national delegations will gather at the summit's
follow-up, the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on
Children.</TE>
<TE>   The message of this meeting is simple and clear: Healthy and
educated children are a critical force to drive economic development.
If we want to overcome poverty, first and foremost we must invest in
children. Yet many governments simply don't give children the
resources they deserve--and that goes both for developing countries
and the donor nations that provide funds.</TE>
<TE>   It may be hard to fathom 2.1billion children, let alone the
desperate situations that ensnare so many of them. Instead, think of
those 100 children. In the world we envision, they would be vibrant
and growing, physically and mentally, in what we call "a world fit
for children."</TE>
<TE>   Supporting the conference's efforts can help today's children and
tomorrow's generations, who in turn will help us build a more
prosperous and stable world. Let's not waste this opportunity.</TE>

<HD>Winning Back the West, Goat by Hungry Goat</HD>
<DH>A natural solution to water-sucking, nonnative trees may
help restore the landscape.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ED MARSTON</AU>
<BD>Ed Marston is a contributor to Writers on the Range, a
service of High Country News, of which he is publisher, in Paonia,
Colo. Web site: www.hcn.org.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the early 1990s, Leslie Barclay bought a 3,100-acre ranch a
half-hour south of Santa Fe, N.M. She was from back East, and, like
many newcomers to the West with some money and energy, she was
romantic about the region and the land. She understood that the ranch
wasn't in great shape, but she thought it had potential. She had the
same dream that brought millions of us to the West over the last 150
years.</LD>
<LD>   Before long, however, she felt defeated by the almost five square
miles of desert she'd taken on. She said she came to understand that
her land was just another beaten-up piece of Western landscape, of
which there are several hundred thousand square miles.</LD>
<LD>   The presenting symptom, as the doctors say, was the thousands of
tamarisk, an exotic Asian tree, on her land, each of which sucked 200
to 300 gallons of water a day out of the ground.</LD>
<TE>   Like vampires at a feast, these trees line Galisteo Creek running
through the ranch. They also encircle five large, dry, man-made lakes
on the ranch.</TE>
<TE>   A bizarre sight on her land is a diving board that sits above one
of the lake beds. Barclay was shocked when she ran into a relatively
young woman who remembered diving off that board 30 years ago. Those
lakes once held water and fish. Only three decades ago, this piece of
the West was wet and alive.</TE>
<TE>   Going back further, beaver trappers described Galisteo Creek as a
narrow and shaded trout stream. Today, the "creek" is as wide as an
interstate. On the spring day I saw it, it held only a trickle of
water and no trout.</TE>
<TE>   To bring it back to life, the New Mexico fish and game agency
offered to bulldoze the tamarisk. Clearing the land would allow rain
and melting snow to soak into the ground, and the grasses would grow.
Then the water table would rise, the lakes would fill and Galisteo
Creek would flow once again.</TE>
<TE>   Even after that, though, the tamarisk probably would sprout again,
filling the ecological niche that was still empty, waiting for these
weedy trees.</TE>
<TE>   Barclay also didn't think she'd feel good about seeing bulldozers
root out the tamarisk. She wanted another solution.</TE>
<TE>   She found what she was looking for last winter at a seminar in
Pueblo, Colo., when she heard former Wyoming cattle rancher Lani
Lamming talk about her 2,000 goats.</TE>
<TE>   Lamming said her herds loved chewing the limbs of tamarisk and
ripping off their bark. Their narrow, triangular, tough mouths will
even devastate a cholla cactus, and they chew weed seeds so
thoroughly that the seeds become fertilizer rather than a source of
new plants.</TE>
<TE>   So this spring, Lamming and 604 cashmere goats appeared at
Barclay's ranch. Lamming says that if the goats return to the ranch
for a few weeks at a time over the next three to five years, the
tamarisk will weaken and die. As the tamarisk retreat, grasses and
willows and cottonwoods alongside the river and lakes will gradually
come back.</TE>
<TE>   Lamming, thanks to her ranching background, makes handling the
goats look easy. She knows how to put up the temporary fences to
contain the goats until they've trashed the tamarisk. She knows how
to train her border collies. And she knows how to deploy her burro to
protect the goats against their main enemy--other people's dogs.</TE>
<TE>   It takes patience. It takes skill. And it costs 30 cents to $1 per
day per goat.</TE>
<TE>   So this is not a quick fix. But why should it be? We have spent
150 years, give or take, destroying the West's middle elevations--the
land above desert and below alpine characterized by sagebrush and
pinon pine and juniper trees and ponderosa pine. This was once the
West's working landscape.</TE>
<TE>   We've reduced that landscape to a condition where it's good mainly
for ranchettes for ex-urbanites who think desert with small trees and
broad washes is "pristine."</TE>
<TE>   But here and there, as on Leslie Barclay's ranch, the Old West and
the New West come together to try to restore the land to health. It's
a gallant effort.</TE>

<LD>By abandoning a settlement worked out with dozens of alleged victims
of a convicted pedophile priest, Boston's embattled Roman Catholic
Cardinal Bernard Law and his finance advisors are in essence telling
the victims, "So sue us."</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps archdiocesan pencil pushers--who rejected as too expensive
the $15 million to $30 million that Law promised for the settlement
of 86 claims of rape and molestation--believe they can get by more
cheaply if each victim has to sue painfully and individually, or if
they can renegotiate the settlement to include dozens of new reported
victims. The Boston officials should study the decades-long,
multibillion-dollar disaster of the asbestos industry's liability
lawsuits and quake in their churchly boots.</LD>
<LD>   The Boston settlement would have established a mediation system to
determine individual awards for alleged victims of convicted
pedophile former priest John J. Geoghan, now suspected of abusing
scores of boys over several decades. Law has admitted that he
transferred Geoghan from parish to parish long after learning of the
sexual abuse allegations.</LD>
<TE>   The alleged victims and their families bought the promises of Law
and diocesan lawyers who arranged the deal. Now that they see what
those promises are worth, how likely are they, or new claimants who
come forth in Boston, to take part in any other deal with the
archdiocese? The fallout is sure to damage settlement attempts in
other parts of the country as well. An early sign of the growing
mistrust engendered by Law's decision is a judge's demand in Boston
that Law appear for a deposition Wednesday in the Geoghan civil
trial. Such a deposition by a Roman Catholic cardinal would be
unprecedented.</TE>
<TE>   Apart from the Geoghan case, there is a growing number of sex
abuse claims involving Father Paul Shanley, arrested last week in San
Diego on a Massachusetts warrant. Law had sent Shanley off to San
Bernardino in 1990, calling him a priest "in good standing in Boston"
despite the knowledge that he advocated "man-boy" sex.</TE>
<TE>   If some of the alleged victims in the Geoghan case go to court,
they will face the church's formidable lawyers, who will surely try
to avoid or limit payments by invoking charitable immunity or
statutes of limitations. But the public-trust losses to the church
will be immeasurable as every accusation is dragged into the
courtroom. And juries, if the cases get that far, may make
stratospheric awards.</TE>
<TE>   Asbestos was used for decades as insulation in ships, schools and
homes across the country. Many workers exposed to asbestos years ago,
sometimes only briefly, developed severe and disabling injuries,
including a fatal respiratory cancer. By the 1930s, scientists had
linked asbestos exposure and disease.</TE>
<TE>   In cases that began in the 1970s, the major producers of asbestos
at first fought nearly all claims, denying that asbestos caused the
plaintiffs' conditions and then refusing to settle, insisting on
trials. By 1982, the asbestos companies and their insurers were
buried in lawsuits and were out an estimated $1 billion for victim
compensation and litigation costs. Later attempts to strike a
universal settlement with all past and likely future claimants have
largely failed to stem the tide. Billions of dollars later, the
lawsuits keep coming.</TE>
<TE>   The sex abuse scandal could be even worse, because of the nature
of the alleged crimes and the possible size of jury awards. Law and
the Boston archdiocese have set out on a path that could endanger not
only the reputation but the finances of the U.S. church itself.</TE>

<HD>A Stain on Jefferson Group</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Monticello Assn.'s 74-6 vote Sunday to bar the kin of Thomas
Jefferson's lover and slave, Sally Hemings, from membership brings to
mind Groucho Marx's quip about not wanting to belong to any club that
would accept him. The association, which represents the documented
descendants of America's third president, prefers to hold Jefferson
frozen in a historical time warp. Jefferson's legacy--which includes
being one of the nation's greatest statesmen and a slave owner--can't
be selectively remembered.</LD>
<LD>   The myth of the founding fathers as paragons of virtue has taken a
beating over the years. Still, many were shocked by the 1998
publication, in the British journal Nature, of DNA analysis that led
many scholars, including those who run the Monticello estate, to
conclude that Jefferson was the father of Hemings' youngest son,
Eston. Southern biographers such as Dumas Malone were aghast at the
idea that their moral hero might have stooped to have sex with, of
all people, a slave.</LD>
<LD>   The true nature of Jefferson's relationship with Hemings will
never be known, partly because it is inevitably viewed through the
filter of modern concerns. Was Jefferson a ruthless predator abusing
his power over a slave for several decades? Or was it an example of
interracial love? In the movie "Jefferson in Paris," Nick Nolte even
portrayed him as a wimp mesmerized by Sally's sexual powers.</LD>
<TE>   If Jefferson did not quite match up to all of the enlightened
ideals he espoused, the Monticello Assn.'s refusal to grant his black
descendants a place at the table adds insult to injury.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the association have hired public relations consultants
and issued gag orders. The result has been endless bickering and
hairsplitting, all toward the end of excluding relatives of African
heritage. This behavior is particularly galling since Jefferson was
the most radical and democratic of the founding fathers, at least in
rhetoric.</TE>
<TE>   What Hemings' descendants really want is recognition. They should
see no stigma in being rejected by the Monticello Assn.; the stigma
belongs to the group that purports to honor Jefferson's legacy but
that instead shames it.</TE>

<LD>An intoxicating "build it and they will come" mentality led the
telecommunications industry to the meltdown that has vaporized $2
trillion in investor funds--so far. The swift demise followed years
of heady growth as WorldCom and other highflying companies raced to
add long-distance capacity and fiber-optic cable for an anticipated
tidal wave of demand from Web-based movie channels, long-distance
medical diagnoses and videoconferencing, among other things. Demand
was way overestimated, and an oversupply of high-speed digital pipes
led to fierce price wars. Low prices are still sapping profits.</LD>
<LD>   The telecom story line already includes bankruptcies (Global
Crossing with more than $12 billion in debt), SEC investigations
(Qwest Communications International) and abrupt leadership changes
(WorldCom Chairman Bernard J. Ebbers, who resigned last week). More
troubling chapters will be written, but Ebbers seems the perfect
example of what has gone wrong.</LD>
<LD>   Using his force of personality and a single-minded vision, Ebbers
transformed a small Mississippi long-distance company into a
telecommunications giant. Ebbers leveraged WorldCom's stock price to
fund a string of acquisitions. Then regulators forbade a $129-billion
merger with Sprint, and Ebbers' deal-making machine halted. WorldCom
was stuck with $30 billion in debt.</LD>
<TE>   Many people are feeling WorldCom's pain. When WorldCom sold $12
billion in investment-grade bonds last year, investors lined up for
what seemed a safe harbor after the dot-com meltdown. What they got
was Mr. Toad's Wild Wall Street Ride; the bonds are now trading at
half their initial value.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom already has shed 9,000 jobs. Last month, it announced
plans to cut 3,700 more--or 4.7% of its remaining work force.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom won't easily escape Ebbers' shadow. The Securities and
Exchange Commission is investigating a $366-million loan that
WorldCom's board of directors recently granted to Ebbers. The SEC
inquiry turned out to be yet another excuse for rattled investors to
hang up on WorldCom, whose stock price has plummeted roughly 80%
since the beginning of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Fate and risk weren't the only forces at work in the telecom bust.
The self-serving shenanigans of Ebbers and other telecom executives
should have been caught earlier. That's the job of Congress and the
Federal Communications Commission, which need to constantly update
laws and regulations in the tech world. Fair markets, especially in a
swiftly changing business like telecom, depend on well-aimed and
-enforced regulation.</TE>

<LD>Re "Mascot Bill May Snare Normans, Saxons Too," May 6: I attended
Venice High School in the 1970s and remain a proud Gondolier to this
day. Our mascot was complete with a droopy mustache and striped
shirt, designed, I suspect, to reflect the name of the town in which
the school was located.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking as an American of Italian and Swedish descent, I can tell
you that it never occurred to me to be offended. I have no problem
with the Vikings across town, either. Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg
(D-Los Angeles) seems to have a lot of energy; maybe she should
devote it to something that matters.</LD>

<TE>   I am very disappointed in The Times' suggestion that the school
mascot issue should remain a local one (editorial, May 2). I am a
graduate of Stanford University and a member of the Potawatomi tribe
and have seen firsthand the efforts needed to rid Stanford of the
Indian mascot. Outside influences tried many times to bring the
Indian back, and again we were fighting an old fight and wasting
energy on this issue.</TE>
<TE>   I support Goldberg's groundbreaking efforts to rid California of
racial and ethnic mascots. No longer will any tribe or Indian people
or ethnic group have to worry about being used as a sports or school
novelty symbol. We are not symbols to be dragged around; we are the
survivors of the original inhabitants of this country.</TE>

<LD>Re "Nike Can't Just Say It, Court Rules," May 3: So the California
Supreme Court has ruled in the Nike case that "speech is commercial
in its content if it is likely to influence consumers in their
commercial decisions," and so it must be truthful. Too bad the court
can't apply the same standards to speech by politicians and elected
government officials who seek to sell their policies in order to
influence the consumers/citizens (i.e., voters). Maybe then we might
get some truth in advertising, political style.</LD>

<LD>I found your April 30 story about the Wiccan religious ceremony that
was disrupted by a group of Christians disturbing. Christians would
be outraged if their Easter sunrise services were interrupted. It was
only a few hundred years ago that many Christians came to this
country fleeing religious persecution. How soon we forget. Maybe
that's why Christ said, "Judge not lest ye be judged."</LD>

<LD>Michael Ramirez's insightful cartoon showing Crown Prince Abdullah of
Saudi Arabia lecturing President Bush on the Middle East (Commentary,
April 30) is a powerful reminder that Osama bin Laden and 15 of the
terrorists who destroyed the World Trade Center were Saudis. Ramirez
correctly highlighted the fact that Saudi oil money is being used to
finance homicide bombers. America must be vigilant to determine who
are friends and who are enemies.</LD>

<HD>No News From Oracle: Davis Likes Money</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis' denial of any knowledge of the Oracle
contract-for-contribution scandal rings hollow in light of his
legendary micromanagement of all aspects of California government
("Hearing Set on Oracle Deal," May 6). This, coupled with his
voracious campaign fund-raising, requires informed observers to take
his plea of ignorance with a grain of salt.</LD>
<LD>   Even if Davis was ignorant of this particular back-room deal, he
has created the atmosphere of a Middle Eastern bazaar in Sacramento,
in which there is the perception not only that contracts and votes
are for sale to special interests but also that groups will be
punished by the potentate if they do not contribute tribute to his
campaign. It is time to replace Davis with a governor who recognizes
that the government must serve the people of the state and that
Californians do not exist just to fill the coffers of his campaigns.</LD>
<LD>   John L. Dodd</LD>
<TE>   Tustin</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I don't know which is worse: "not knowing" about a $95-million
contract with Oracle or not admitting to it. Perhaps Davis should
spend more time governing than raising campaign funds for ... what?
What does he do?</TE>
<TE>   Gregory Polito</TE>
<TE>   Whittier</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Times reports that Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer is probing the
Oracle deal. One has to wonder if Lockyer's acceptance of $200,000
from Oracle since 1999 will affect his perspective.</TE>

<LD>Re "Oversee the Power to the People," Commentary, April 29:</LD>
<LD>   In arguing for regulated electricity for small consumers and a
deregulated system for big business, Bill Ahern and Michael McCauley
get it half right. They are correct in pointing out that electricity
deregulation devastated California's consumers, but the hybrid system
advocated in their commentary would impose unnecessary costs on the
very residential and small-business consumers who were victimized the
most by California's disastrous policy experiment. The theoretical
advantages of such a proposal would be obliterated by the practical
reality of Sacramento politics.</LD>
<LD>   The powerful big-business lobby would see to it that no meaningful
"exit fees" were imposed on companies that escaped the state's
long-term power deals and residential and small-business consumers
would pay more to cover the large industrial companies' share of the
contracts. California's public policy should move us in the direction
of cleaner, cheaper power that is regulated in the interests of all
ratepayers.</LD>

<HD>Ethanol Takes Energy to Produce</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With regard to "Emphasize Ethanol," letter, May 4: Producing ethanol
from corn is a net energy loser. The amount of energy needed to
produce a gallon of ethanol--fuel for mechanized equipment to plant
and harvest the corn, and subsequent fermentation and
distillation--is more than the energy obtained from the ethanol
produced. The energy to produce the ethanol is obtained from oil.
Thus, increased reliance on ethanol does not decrease our dependence
on oil, it increases it. If only 10% of U.S. fuel needed to be
ethanol, the necessary corn would have to be grown on 500 million
acres of land, more than the total arable land area of the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Ethanol producers have long been aware of these facts and have
largely abandoned this "alternate fuel" approach to their pork
barrel. Instead, they are promoting it as a clean-air additive,
however unnecessary that may be.</LD>

<HD>Reparations: When the Political Is Personal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After reading "Slave Owners and Their Insurers Are Named" (May 2), it
occurred to me that I too have a case for reparations. You see, my
mother's side of the family is Chiricahua Apache. If anyone deserves
a little payback, it should be the descendants of a people who were
nearly eradicated from the face of the Earth. After coming to this
revelation, I began to wonder whom I should sue.</LD>
<LD>   I could sue the Army, since the Army rode roughshod over my
forefathers throughout the Southwest. Or I could sue the federal
government for loading my surviving ancestors onto boxcars and
shipping them east, like cattle, to open their land for settlement.
Or I could sue the descendants of the settlers, since it was their
ancestors who pushed the government to open the West in the first
place. The Irish, for example, immigrated to this country and often
found their land of opportunity inconveniently in the hands of
savages.</LD>
<LD>   However, I then remembered that my father's ancestors immigrated
to America from Ireland in 1705, gradually pushed westward over the
next 200 years, held various positions in the government along the
way and occasionally served in the Army. I have, therefore, decided
to sue myself.</LD>

<TE>   The Japanese received money for being subjected to concentration
camps, and Bill Simon Jr. states that "we cannot right the wrongs of
history by handing out money generations later." As a working person,
I think that comment is obnoxious. Mr. Simon, by sending, say,
$20,000, to the head of every black household in the U.S. we can
right a wrong, and with a much cheaper price tag than 40 acres and a
mule.</TE>

<TE>   While I do not take issue with the importance of this information
(in fact, I find it interesting), I do not understand why California
is expending public funds on this issue--other than the political
capital some would gain. Most of the research was paid for by the
insurance companies to fulfill the directive they were given, but the
Legislature passed a bill and the Department of Insurance expended
resources to collect the information and issue the reports.</TE>
<TE>   Reading the report and list of slave owners, I don't see
California as a participant in the activity at issue. So why is
California expending resources on this? Most of the slave owners and
the slaves listed in the report were in Kentucky, Georgia, Virginia
and North and South Carolina. Why aren't these efforts concentrated
in those states?</TE>

<LD>I want to make note of the excellent May 2 editorial on street gangs,
"No More Duck and Cover." At its conclusion, I could not help but
recall John Balzar's May 1 commentary, "Too Many Officials, No
Leaders," on the ungovernable nature of overgrown L.A. communities
and their problems. It was one of the best, most directly applicable
columns ever printed in The Times. It is just as applicable to the
street gang editorial as it is to the San Fernando Valley secession
movement. As Balzar states, it takes more than housing tracts and
shopping centers to make cohesive, self-governing communities.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, most of California has just grown without attention
to what is really required to govern.</LD>

<TE>   Some people say that Los Angeles is too large to govern
effectively. While our population has swelled to 3.7 million, our
geographical boundaries have remained basically the same for 90
years. Clearly we could govern ourselves back then when we were a
physically large city, so it's not a matter of surface area.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's population? I don't think so. Whether we like it or
not, our young city is a world city and should be compared with other
world cities. We are tiny compared with New York's nearly 8 million
and London's 7 million, and on par with Berlin's 3.5-million
inhabitants. They have been effectively governed for hundreds of
years, and we can do it as well.</TE>

unfettered access to air travel throughout the country. This may be a
security risk that California's leaders are willing to take, but what
about the other states and the federal government? Don't they have a

<LD>Two maintenance workers were injured, one critically, when an
electrical panel exploded Monday at an Irvine processing plant,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The men, both 43, were changing a circuit breaker in the main
electrical room at Valley Processing, a rubber-processing plant in
the 17000 block of Eastman Avenue, when the explosion occurred about
8 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   "Something fell, causing a short arc," said Capt. Stephen Miller,
a spokesman for the Orange County Fire Authority. That caused the
explosion, he said.</LD>
<TE>   The burned workers were taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange.</TE>
<TE>   One was reported in critical condition with second- and
third-degree burns over 30% of his body, Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   The other was in moderate condition with burns on 20% of his body.
The names of the two men were not immediately released.</TE>

<LD>Curtis Williams, 24, paralyzed from the neck down while playing
football for the University of Washington in October 2000, died
Monday at his brother's home in Fresno, Washington athletic
department spokesman Jim Daves said. He gave no additional details
about any cause of death.</LD>
<LD>   Williams, who played safety, was injured in a helmet-to-helmet hit
in a game against Stanford. He had spinal cord surgery and was left
with no voluntary muscle movement.</LD>
<LD>   The Washington Huskies dedicated their victory over Purdue in the
Rose Bowl in January 2001 to Williams, wearing his initials on their
jerseys. He attended the game.</LD>
<TE>   Williams returned to the school last month to watch the Huskies'
annual spring game, his first trip back since the injury.</TE>
<TE>   He was six classes short of earning his degree from Washington in
American Ethnic Studies. He had hoped to take correspondence courses
and complete the work in about a year.</TE>

<HD>J.R. Stork, 85; Flier in Daring Raid on Tokyo</HD>

<LD>"No, I'm not a hero. I just did the best I possibly could. And I was
lucky to get through it ..."</LD>
<LD>   --J. Royden Stork for "A</LD>
<LD>   Veteran's Story" on Military.com Web site</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What he got through was Lt. Col. James H. Doolittle's daring raid
on Tokyo on April 18, 1942, the first successful American retaliatory
strike after Japan's bombing of Pearl Harbor, which brought the
United States into World War II.</TE>
<TE>   J. Royden Stork was co-pilot of the 10th of 16 land-based B-25
bombers to take off from the deck of the Hornet--a feat never before
attempted and considered by many a suicide mission for the 80 men
aboard.</TE>
<TE>   Flying at tree-top level, Stork's plane correctly bombed its
assigned chemical plant and flew on until, like the others, it ran
out of gas over occupied China.</TE>
<TE>   Stork, who not only survived the raid but the rest of the war and
went on to become a Hollywood makeup artist, died Thursday at Century
City Hospital of a heart attack. He was 85.</TE>
<TE>   "The 16 planes didn't do much damage, but we sure screwed up their
war machine," Stork told the Boston Herald last month during 60th
anniversary observances of the raid. "They had to pull back some of
their forces to protect the [Japanese] homeland, and some of their
military leaders were so humiliated that they committed suicide."</TE>
<TE>   President Franklin D. Roosevelt orchestrated the raid, not for the
limited bomb damage it could cause, but to boost sagging American
morale and to shock the Japanese, who thought distance protected them
from attack. Not only had the Japanese sunk most of the Pacific Fleet
at Pearl Harbor, but in the intervening 132 days, they had also
defeated American forces at Wake Island and in the Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   Doolittle's Raid made Americans believe they could win the war and
step up their efforts to do it.</TE>
<TE>   Not one of Doolittle's planes was lost to enemy fire. Of the 16,
one crash-landed, three were ditched in coastal waters, one landed in
Russia and the other 11 in China. Two of the 80 men drowned, and of
eight captured, three were executed by Japanese and one died in
prison camp.</TE>
<TE>   Stork was among a dozen or so of the fewer than two dozen members
of the Doolittle Raiders Assn. still living who gathered last month
in Columbia, S.C., for the group's 60th anniversary reunion.</TE>
<TE>   He described his harrowing Doolittle Raid experience many times
over the years, beginning with an article published by The Times
shortly after the attack and datelined China. Before parachuting out
of the gasless plane, he said in that interview nearly six decades
ago, he stuffed his pockets full of candy bars and cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   "Those bars were flung in every direction, my parachute gave me
such a flip," he said. "It was pouring rain and in no time my chute
was soaked with water, and I was falling very fast. I couldn't see
anything in the dark so I was in a completely relaxed condition when
I hit the ground. Otherwise I might have been hurt. I must have been
knocked unconscious as I don't remember anything until I found myself
lying against a tree. I lay in the rain until morning before starting
out."</TE>
<TE>   The downed co-pilot walked for a day until he was befriended by a
local Chinese magistrate who helped him get to the pre-assigned
rendezvous point an additional three days away. Stationed afterward
in India with the Army's 10th Air Force, Stork flew missions over
Japanese occupied territory in the China-Burma-India theater for 16
months.</TE>
<TE>   But Stork was grounded from combat flying, along with the other 73
surviving Doolittle Raiders, when U.S. intelligence learned that the
Japanese had put a $5,000 bounty on each of the fliers' heads.</TE>
<TE>   Stork returned to the U.S. and spent the remainder of the war
flying for the Air Transport Command and evaluating equipment for use
in the war abroad. He was discharged in early 1946 with the rank of
captain, after earning the Distinguished Flying Cross; the Air Medal;
and the Chinese Army, Navy and Air Corps Medal Class A First Grade,
which had been presented to him by Madame Chiang Kai-shek.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Frost, Minn., Stork grew up in San Diego and attended San
Diego State before joining the Army Air Force Nov. 25, 1940. He
completed advanced flight training the following April, a year before
he found himself aboard the Hornet with his destination unknown.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Stork made his career in Hollywood as a makeup
artist for Fox Studios. Among his credits were such feature films as
the 1949 "Twelve O'Clock High" starring Gregory Peck commanding
American pilots in England during the war.</TE>
<TE>   Stork may have revealed a personal identity with that film in his
interview on the military Web site concerning his "luck" over Tokyo:
"There were plenty of ... fellows I graduated with from flying school
that ended up in the major league in England, where ... they'd send
out a hundred B-17s, and they'd only get 30 back.... I think that
those guys are [the] heroes."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his Hollywood career--which also included work on such
feature films as "For Heaven's Sake" in 1950 and "Gargoyles" in 1972
and such television series as "The Beverly Hillbillies"--Stork
continued to speak out for the reality of World War II heroes and
events.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, he was among veterans who attended the Honolulu
premiere of the blockbuster movie "Pearl Harbor." He was also one of
eight surviving Doolittle Raiders to meet with scriptwriter Randall
Wallace to complain that both Doolittle and the raid were incorrectly
depicted in the film.</TE>
<TE>   Stork is survived by his wife of 44 years, the former Kay Adelle.</TE>
<TE>   No services are planned.</TE>
