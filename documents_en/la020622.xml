<DH>Sammy Hagar and David Lee Roth are touring together,
without Van Halen. 'Together' being a relative term.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFF BOUCHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>You can tell a lot about a rock star by the way he serves drinks to
his fans, and that is especially true of rock's strange bedfellows of
the moment, David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar. The rival voices of Van
Halen are touring as an uneasy alliance, and their approaches to
music and life are as different as a high-priced strip club and a
beach bar where the regulars get a free shot.</LD>
<LD>   Roth's set is a fast, tight race through the Van Halen hits,
presented with his gyrating martial arts kicks and raunchy films
looping on a rear screen.</LD>
<LD>   Sweating, bare-chested and wearing skin-tight cerulean pants, Roth
is a rock star always at a distance from the fans--except when he
feigns masturbation with a bottle of Jack Daniel's and empties the
whiskey on two shocked young men in the front row. Shivering, the
pair appear uncertain whether they have been christened or
humiliated.</LD>
<TE>   The booze in Hagar's set, on the other hand, is served with a
smile. Two bleachers at the rear of the stage are filled with fans
who are served margaritas throughout the show. Hagar performs
barefoot, chats betweens songs and projects a "man of the people"
ethos. While Roth leaves the stage nearly naked, Hagar trudges off
weighted down with clothes tossed by fans--a ball cap, a hockey
jersey, beads and an American flag that he wraps around himself like
a sarong.</TE>
<TE>   The mercurial Roth chuckles at the idea of the tour as a tale of
two bars and offers another thought: "If you want to split a bottle
with a friend, then Sammy is your guy. But if you want to split your
friend with a bottle, then call me."</TE>
<TE>   No one would be surprised if this tour also ends in broken glass
and bruises, but so far, at the UMB Bank Pavilion outside St. Louis,
it's been only a mildly grumpy affair with no injuries.</TE>
<TE>   The Roth-Hagar tour, which begins a Southern California stint
tonight at the Glen Helen Blockbuster Pavilion, seems a match made in
purgatory. The two have little in common, either personally or
musically, other than a grudge against their former bandmate, Eddie
Van Halen, for exiling them from the group. For the guitarist, whose
band is now in limbo, the Roth-Hagar teaming must be as endearing as
an ex-wives club.</TE>
<TE>   "Those guys are sitting there without a record deal and Dave and I
out on tour," Hagar says. "It's crazy. Ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   Roth offers a different description: "The way I make decisions is
based on what makes good drinking stories. This is compelling, not
competitive. There's no real rivalry here."</TE>
<TE>   Rivalry or not, the two can seem like bickering castaways sharing
a career raft, each hoping against hope that the good ship Van Halen
returns to pick him up.</TE>
<TE>   "Where the hell is Dave?" The usually personable Hagar, guitar in
hand, is fuming and prowling the backstage corridors in search of
Roth.</TE>
<TE>   Hagar wants to do a joint interview and photo session for The
Times, but after a long delay, word comes back that the Roth won't
emerge from his tour bus. Hagar groans, offers a few choice
descriptions of Roth's personality, then shrugs and plops down on a
couch. "Ah, who needs him?"</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, Hagar and Roth do appear to need each other, if
either wants a spotlight remotely as intense as that of their Van
Halen days.</TE>
<TE>   The pair have received the most press attention either has enjoyed
in years, and the tour has been a strong seller. Reviewers have been
generally kind, and their critiques have steadily grown more
favorable as the tour has picked up some polish.</TE>
<TE>   Each singer does a 90-minute set with his own band, alternating
the closing spot each night. Don't expect these disparate performers
to perform a duet tonight or at their Monday and Tuesday visits to
the Universal Amphitheatre: They have yet to appear on stage together
at any show, they travel separately and, if the St. Louis stop is any
indication, they never set eyes on each other backstage.</TE>
<TE>   Hagar estimates that he has been in the same room with Roth only
four or five times ever, just a few hours' worth of shared time for
singers whose names and fortunes have been linked for years.</TE>
<TE>   Roth's history with Van Halen began in 1973, when he auditioned
for a young Pasadena band called Mammoth that featured brothers Eddie
and Alex Van Halen on guitar and drums, respectively. Bassist Michael
Anthony joined a year later and by the end of the decade Van Halen
was a monster success. Eddie's guitar style changed the template of
heavy metal for a generation; Roth's playful raunch and jungle cat
athleticism made him an ideal frontman; and singles such as "Runnin'
With the Devil," "And the Cradle Will Rock ... " and the No. 1 hit
"Jump" became defining songs.</TE>
<TE>   By the mid-1980s, though, the band's relationship soured and Roth
was out, replaced by Hagar, an arena-rock veteran as a solo performer
and with the band Montrose. Many doubted the move, but the first
Hagar-era release, "5150," was a hugely successful album, and the
music moved to a new place. The Roth lyrical irony was replaced with
heartfelt Hagar in singles such as "Dreams," "Why Can't This Be Love"
and "Right Now," and the Van Halen fans stayed on while Roth's solo
career floundered.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that really hurt Dave," Hagar says. "It made him angry.
It made him dislike me. When his career wasn't doing so good--and I'm
not dissing him here, that's a fact--and, well, if I was him I would
have been the same way. If Gary Cherone came in and sold 7 million
copies with his first Van Halen album, yeah, I would have been mad,
too."</TE>
<TE>   Roth did rejoin Van Halen in 1996, but it was a disaster,
culminating in Hagar's departure (whether he was fired or quit
depends on who you ask) and Roth's second exit from the band.</TE>
<TE>   Cherone was the singer who replaced Hagar, but only long enough to
record one album, 1998's "Van Halen III," by far the worst seller of
the band's 13 releases. Cherone was canned and the Van Halen brand
name has been on hold ever since. Eddie Van Halen had a bout with
cancer but has now been given a clean bill of health, and the band
split with its longtime label, Warner Bros., last year.</TE>
<TE>   Hagar and Roth both have sought to get Van Halen back on the road,
but other than Anthony's pitching in as an infrequent guest on this
tour (he is expected to play the Southern California shows), the
reunion looks no closer to reality. "I don't know what's going on
with them," Hagar says. "I don't know if they have the heart for it
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   At 54, Hagar is fit and affable and exudes the self-contained
satisfaction of a longtime surfer on his board at sunrise. His father
was a steelworker and onetime boxer, and the blue-collar roots show
in both Hagar's work ethic and his carousing. He is an admitted
sentimentalist and says he's changed little since the days before he
became a rock star who owns a jet, a tequila company and a bar in
Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the same guy. I still want the same things out of my life. I
haven't changed, and most people do change. And I'm kind of proud of
it."</TE>
<TE>   If Hagar is a man of constants and obvious compass points, Roth is
slippery and ironic, a Cheshire cat in spandex. An intense martial
arts maven, the 47-year-old singer walks with an athletic gait,
shoulders back and elbows out, like a gunslinger ready to draw. The
familiar mane of bleached blond hair has a balding spot now but,
sitting on his bus after his St. Louis show, he covers it with a cap.</TE>
<TE>   After hours of stalling, Roth has agreed to be interviewed at the
precise moment that Hagar steps on stage for his set--perhaps
suggesting that Roth is less than candid about the lack of rivalry
here. In conversation, Roth is tangential, bristling with odd
references and one-liners. When asked if he is having a good time on
tour, he answers, "In many cases it's like I imagine sailing would be
or someone in military or an extreme academic.... Art is struggle. I
love the struggle more than ever before. It's about dangerous waves
of consequence. If there's no conflict I seem to create it, doc. Once
something is stabilized, go bigger. We aren't innocents but we are
abroad."</TE>
<TE>   Roth does not want to excavate his Van Halen past during the brief
interview. But the singer does say he believes there is something
"very wrong" in the hearts and heads of the Van Halen brothers. "I
just know that they're not competing. I'm competing. I'm out here."</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Van Halen could not be reached for comment, but he has said
in recent months that he has a vast storehouse of new material in
various stages of completion. Scotty Ross, the band's tour manager,
says he has spent four years waiting for the brothers. "I talk to
them all the time; they're doing good," Ross says. "They just can't
figure out what they're doing. They just can't decide what to do
next."</TE>
<TE>   Could their next incarnation include Roth or Hagar? "Never say
never," Ross says.</TE>
<TE>   At the show here, Don Pruitt, a longtime friend of Hagar, follows
him around with a tape recorder. The two have been working on the
singer's autobiography off and on through the years, and this night,
it turns out, will be the final anecdote in the book. At least that's
the plan for the moment.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope there will be another chapter," Hagar says. "Someday the
whole thing will come together, or otherwise it doesn't make any
sense. The whole thing is Eddie, Alex, Michael, Sammy and Dave, all
of us, together. That's all I want. I don't want to be in Van Halen.
I don't even really want to be on tour with Dave. It's just the
second-best thing. It's the choice I got. But the real thing would be
all of us to do it. One time for the big time."</TE>

<HD>Bill Maher Wraps Up a Few Thoughts</HD>
<DH>Television* As 'Politically Incorrect' departs, its host
says the format is played out. He insists that he'll return to TV
soon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You could cast a dozen Hollywood blockbusters with the celebrities
who never did "Politically Incorrect With Bill Maher."</LD>
<LD>   The show, which debuted on Comedy Central on July 25, 1993 (guests
on the first broadcast were Jerry Seinfeld, Larry Miller, Robin
Quivers and Ed Rollins), moved to ABC in 1996. It was canceled a
month ago, to be replaced weeknights at 12:05 a.m. with a show hosted
by Jimmy Kimmel. But that program won't debut until after the 2003
Super Bowl; in the interim, ABC will run an extended version of its
11:30 p.m. "Nightline."</LD>
<LD>   Maher's last show is Friday, when he will have on "the four best
friends I made from the show": Arianna Huffington (who will have done
the show 42 times), Christopher "Kid" Reid, Ann Coulter and Michelle
Phillips.</LD>
<TE>   This is not a booker's dream, but then, it has always been thus
for a talk show that asked its guests to have an opinion, all while
someone like Ted Nugent was free associating into their left ear.</TE>
<TE>   Publicists worried that star clients would misspeak, get insulted
or, worse, appear bereft of thought as a conversation went whizzing
over their heads. For Hollywood, the business at hand--plugging the
movie, the CD, the TV series, yourself--was more easily accomplished
on any number of more high-profile talk shows. Plus, Maher could be
cantankerous and unpleasant. He could never bring himself to watch
the show, he said, but evidently he would look disgustedly at his
guests.</TE>
<TE>   Over lunch recently, as he prepared to take "a long vacation,"
Maher played a game of "Did the Celebrity Ever Do Your Show?"</TE>
<TE>   Julia Roberts? No. Jennifer Aniston? No. George Clooney? Once.
Brad Pitt? Close, around the time of "Fight Club," but no. Matt
Damon? No. Ben Affleck? "Ben Affleck is truly a great guest," Maher
said, brightening. "Even if he was the third lead on a crappy sitcom,
I would say, 'Rebook him.' " Gwyneth Paltrow? No. Bill Murray? No.
Dustin Hoffman? No. J.Lo? Maher laughed. John Travolta? "He took five
minutes one night to tell me he watches it. He at least made an
effort to tell me why he felt uncomfortable." Jim Carrey? "Those are
the ones that really hurt," Maher said. "Robin Williams has never
done the show. All my comic buddies." Madonna? "She wasn't even very
nice when I asked her," Maher said. "I asked her at a party once."</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, as the show was dying on the vine amid ABC's attempts
to woo David Letterman from CBS, Barbra Streisand (who also never did
the show) issued a statement from her Malibu compound, calling
"Politically Incorrect" "an important forum for the dialogue that is
the foremost foundation of democracy."</TE>
<TE>   Maher, who called Streisand "a wonderful patron of the show," said
he understood why the star never actually came in-studio to
participate in this "foundation of democracy." "She is a
perfectionist about everything; it's not a situation she can control.
And as a control freak myself, I do understand."</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, Maher will be honored by the L.A. Press Club. On the one
hand, it's a bit difficult to cast him as a First Amendment martyr,
given that he lasted five years on Walt Disney-owned ABC, which
didn't like it when he talked up drugs but otherwise gave him a
pulpit. Maher, 46, still has a soapbox in stand-up comedy (he
continues to tour). He insists he'll be back on television in the
near future but declined to offer specifics, hinting a deal was in
the works (HBO is his rumored next home).</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, Maher said he feels the "Politically Incorrect" format
has been played out and that 22 minutes is too confining. He
disagrees with the perception that he grew more arch, that the Comedy
Central years were freer in spirit and easier to watch.</TE>
<TE>   What he's decided is that people want a more streamlined program,
more of Maher talking about the president and less, say, of Carrot
Top talking about the president. He gets a lot of feedback when he
does CNN's "Larry King Live," Maher said. "What I'm gonna do is to
purify it more, so that there's a little less clutter," he said. "I
think that's what the audience is telling me. A little less clutter."</TE>
<TE>   In a preamble on the show last month, in the days after his
cancellation became official, Maher outlined some of the views he's
espoused over the years--the ideology that, by degrees, moved him
away from Bill Maher the comedian to Bill Maher the network nuisance
and iconoclast.</TE>
<TE>   "I think America causes cancer, longevity is less important than
fun, and young people should be discouraged from voting.... I think
children are not innocent, God doesn't write books and Jesus wasn't a
Republican.... "</TE>
<TE>   He is against "Big Food" ("Food is never neutral. It's either
helping you or hurting you," he said) but not for suing Big Tobacco.
Maher, presumably, could take this act to cable, home to any number
of political chat shows and shouting heads, and where pulling in
fewer than 1 million viewers a night is not necessarily a problem,
provided you perpetuate media attention and "brand" your network.</TE>
<TE>   "I do have more original, better takes on any issue that comes
along than I find anywhere else in television," Maher asserted.
"People who comment on television say the same predictable,
doctrinaire things."</TE>
<TE>   Maher's unpredictability has brought its share of trouble.
On-camera and off, he can be uncouth with the best of them. Last
year, he drew an analogy between pet dogs and retarded children,
saying "they're sweet. They're kind. But they don't mentally advance
at all." He later apologized.</TE>
<TE>   And on Sept. 17, of course, on his first broadcast after the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks, Maher touched off a bigger backlash when,
countering the notion that the hijackers were cowards, he said of the
U.S. government's military strategy: "We have been the cowards,
lobbing cruise missiles from 2,000 miles away."</TE>
<TE>   Maher had run afoul of sponsors and affiliates in the past, but
his Sept. 17 remarks--delivered in the face of the nation's
trauma--seemed to signal he'd overstayed his welcome. Sears Roebuck &amp;
Co. and FedEx Corp. pulled their ads, and some ABC affiliates--most
notably the one in Washington, D.C.--refused to air the show.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever goodwill remained between "Politically Incorrect" and ABC
vanished as well. With the show's contract up for renewal, divorce
was in the air, anyway. Amid regular management shuffles at the
network, "Politically Incorrect" had lost the executive who brought
it to ABC years ago--a key reason for its demise, insiders say.</TE>
<TE>   But after Sept. 17, Maher said, he was officially regarded as "the
crazy aunt in the attic" by ABC. After some prodding, the network
issued a statement saying it is "extremely proud of the fact that,
for the past five years, ABC has afforded Bill Maher a national
platform for his unique take on the world," calling the show's run
both "challenging" and "rewarding."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any animosity toward the network," he added. "I knew
who I was dancing with when I accepted the date." His show's ratings
had shown some attrition--down from a little more than 3 million
viewers in 1996-97 to about 2.5 million viewers in 2001-2002,
according to Nielsen Media Research.</TE>
<TE>   After losing out on Letterman in the spring, ABC grabbed Kimmel,
of Comedy Central's "The Man Show," hoping to create a more
profitable, younger-skewing show. While "Nightline's" Ted Koppel
refused to tease "Politically Incorrect," ABC is hoping Kimmel will
pull in viewers even less apt to be watching the network at midnight.</TE>
<TE>   Predictably, Maher pits the evolution of his show alongside the
devolution of the networks. And he wonders how a show as substantive
as his can fit in the current climate in network suites.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the broadcast networks know where they're going,"
he said. "They have this schizophrenia where on the one hand they're
very snobby, because I've pitched them various shows over the years,
and they're very snobby. And on the other hand they put on the most
base sort of reality [shows], basically torturing people for money.
So, they're hypocritical and schizophrenic, and more than that I
think they're in a panic. They don't know what to do."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone, of course, regards the death of "Politically
Incorrect" as proof that the networks are disengaged from serving the
public trust.</TE>
<TE>   Matthew Felling of the Center for Media and Public Affairs, a
nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank in Washington, said those who
consider "Politically Incorrect" vital to political discussion
probably feel "Bulworth" should be shown in political science
classes.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Felling said: "All the experts talk about blurring the line
between news and entertainment. And 'Politically Incorrect' embodied
that blur, for better and for worse. It brought with it the merit of
news and it brought the mindlessness of entertainment. But it has to
be commended for trying."</TE>
<TE>   "Politically Incorrect," Maher said, was not simply about trying
to get celebrities to expound on abortion. He pointed to the
citizens' panels the show did one year.</TE>
<TE>   "One guy said we should napalm the border to stop immigration,"
Maher recalled. "You're not going to get that out of Sharon
Lawrence."</TE>

<LD>I saw the final dress rehearsal of "Follies," and it seems like I saw
an entirely different production than the one Reed Johnson reviewed
(" 'Follies' Remains Marvelous Contradiction," June 18).</LD>
<LD>   To imply that Patty Duke might have to "win over" the audience in
order to be a "keeper" in the lead foursome was totally unfair. Her
acting, as always, was superb. She also sang and danced (and did a
great, campy job of it, judging by the audience reception the night I
attended).</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps Johnson is too young to appreciate the abilities of the
performers in the starring roles, or the midlife crisis they portray.
At any rate, I applaud Duke for her performance--and feel it's
Johnson's "folly" not to recognize talent when he sees it.</LD>

genius of the previous three and a half hours--not only does a great
disservice to a truly brilliant and innovative theatrical experience
but to the Los Angeles cultural community and its audiences as well
("A King-Size Challenge in Experimental 'Lear,' " June 17).</TE>
<TE>   It has been more than a decade since this kind of radical
redefining of theatrical performance on this scale has even been
attempted in this city, and it merits a more illuminating discussion
than Segal's own cranky negativity. It's no wonder we have had to
wait so long for such daring endeavors.</TE>

<TE>   I have just finished reading Kenneth Turan's review of
"Windtalkers" ("Unable to Crack the Code," June 14). He seems to have
fallen into the same trap as your opera reviewers, to wit: Line after
line about the director (John Woo) and a nod toward the script and
photography, but, except for mentioning him, there is nothing to tell
us whether Nicolas Cage's performance is worthy of another Academy
Award. Or how the others in the cast succeeded or failed.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Mr. Turan, I'd like to know whether or not these actors
turned in a good, mediocre or execrable performance. Or were you
being kind?</TE>

<TE>   Howard Reich's article asks "Where Exactly Have All the Great Male
Jazz Singers Gone?" (June 17). They are alive and well, Howard, but
you have to get out more and listen.</TE>
<TE>   On the Maxjazz label there's a marvelous singer named Philip
Manuel who just drips with "hip." If you miss Sinatra, pick up a copy
of James Darren's "Because of You" album on Concord Records. You'll
hear great big band arrangements, top-drawer material and a voice
that is incredibly Sinatra-esque. On Columbia Records you'll find
Steve Tyrell, who's a great interpreter with just a little edge. The
venerable Ben E. King on Half Note Records is a great example of what
a jazz singer with a lot of soul can do.</TE>
<TE>   Great talent isn't found around every corner--you have to look for
it. But you also have to recognize it when you've found it. It seems
to me that Reich is incapable of either.</TE>

<LD>Deborah Hornblow is on target in her June 14 article, "A Double
Standard for Male and Female Emotions on Film." I for one am tired of
these male character-dominated films being accepted as worthy of
"general" audiences and consider the majority of them "boy-joy" (for
a male audience) flicks.</LD>
<LD>   It is annoying to me, as a woman, to watch the perennial
self-aggrandizement of men through the sanctification of male bonding
and war in Hollywood films, while listening to them haughtily refer
to works like "The Joy Luck Club," "Sense and Sensibility" and
"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood" as "chick flicks."</LD>
<LD>   VICTORIA VIDAL</LD>
<TE>   North Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps male suffering and male bonding in such movies as "Saving
Private Ryan" is ennobling in a way that female suffering and bonding
in "Ya-Ya Sisterhood" is not because men in such movies are risking
death and fighting for something much larger than themselves--the
defeat of the Nazi war machine--while Sandra Bullock and the women in
"chick flicks" are picking the lint out of their emotional navels.</TE>
<TE>   One looks outward and sacrifices for a greater good. The other
looks inward in order to shore up a withered self-esteem. That one is
more profound than the other no one seems pressed to understand
except disgruntled feminists stretching for a grievance.</TE>

Hanks in his mid-40s is a joke. Does he have a terminal illness we

<LD>It takes courage these days to have convictions, especially regarding
homosexuality if one differs with Howard Rosenberg's opinions
("Valuable 'Nick News' Examines Gay Parenting," June 18). He brands
us as "haters," even when we harbor goodwill toward gays while
rejecting the act of homosexuality.</LD>
<LD>   We once had as neighbors a lesbian couple that we enjoyed, helping
each other with projects, being together on the ball diamond and,
yes, even going to church together on occasion. But I reject the
endorsement of this lifestyle on "Nick News," even in the face of
Rosenberg's self-righteous liberalism. I only wish I could agree with
Rosenberg; it takes less courage.</LD>

<LD>   CNN Envoy Smoothing Ruffled Feathers</LD>
<LD>   Eason Jordan, CNN's president of news gathering, arrived in Israel
on Friday on a peace mission of sorts--a response to criticism of the
network's Middle East coverage and calls to have the network taken
off that country's airwaves.</LD>
<TE>   Jordan visited the sites of the last two terrorist bombings and
planned to meet with academic leaders, Israeli journalists, terror
victims, Palestinians and government officials.</TE>
<TE>   He said legitimate concerns have been raised about a handful of
instances in which the CNN International network juxtaposed comments
from victims of suicide bombings with people who applauded the acts.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a difference between fair and balanced when it comes to
terrorism," Jordan said. "Certainly, all sides should be heard, but
we're not giving as much time to terrorists and their supporters."</TE>
<TE>   A memo has been sent advising the news staff not to televise such
statements "without an extraordinarily compelling reason to do so."</TE>
<TE>   Recent remarks about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by CNN
founder Ted Turner added fuel to the fire, despite the fact that he's
since apologized. "I would make the case that both sides are engaged
in terrorism," Turner told a London newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly his comments aggravated matters," Jordan conceded.</TE>
<TE>   The situation has provided an opening for CNN's chief U.S.
competitor, Fox News Channel. This week, Israel's YES satellite
company, with 310,000 subscribers, started airing Fox News
programming--months sooner than Fox executives had expected.</TE>

<TE>   Citing complaints from "Morning Edition" listeners, KCRW-FM (89.9)
pulled "The Tavis Smiley Show" from its morning lineup after only one
week.</TE>
<TE>   Smiley's show, a one-hour newsmagazine, is the first National
Public Radio production originating from Los Angeles and is the
network's first signature program by an African American host. It
debuted nationwide in January and went on the air in L.A. on June
3--on KCRW at 5 a.m., in the middle of a 3-9 a.m. block of "Morning
Edition," and on KPCC-FM (89.3) at 8 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "The audience simply wouldn't accept" [the "Morning Edition"
interruption], said Ruth Seymour, KCRW general manager. "I've been
well-known for changing programming, but this was too pervasive. The
outcry was just enormous."</TE>
<TE>   Seymour said she had no plans to reinstitute Smiley elsewhere on
the schedule. He remains on KPCC weeknights at 8.</TE>

<TE>   Getty Buys 'Lost' Gauguin Sculpture</TE>
<TE>   The J. Paul Getty Museum has bought a Gauguin sculpture of a man's
head with horns that experts believe is partly a self-portrait. While
the museum label says the work was bought from a private collection,
it was actually purchased from Wildenstein, the Manhattan gallery,
for more than $3 million, the New York Times reports.</TE>
<TE>   "Head With Horns," (1895-7) is particularly valuable because it
was thought to be lost and was known to scholars only through
photographs. The Getty's first sculpture by the artist, it is now
being displayed in a Gauguin exhibition at New York's Metropolitan
Museum of Art. After the show closes on Oct. 20, it will head west to
the Getty, where it will be joined by "Head of a Tahitian Woman," an
1892 drawing the museum bought last year.</TE>

longest-running production on Broadway, will be the first Western
musical to play in China. The production, to be performed in English
with Chinese supertitles at the top of the stage, begins a 16-day run
today, according to Eonline.... Jackie Chan will star in a remake of
the 1956 movie "Around the World in 80 Days," with Frank Coraci
directing. He'll play Passepartout, who guides and defends inventor
Phileas Fogg, a role yet to be cast, as he traverses the globe in an
effort to win a bet.... TBS will air "American Prince: The JFK Jr.
Story" next winter, according to the Hollywood Reporter, with
Jacqueline Bisset as his mother and Portia de Rossi as his wife,
Carolyn.</TE>

<HD>Sexy TV Reduces Ads' Appeal, Study Finds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHANKAR VEDANTAM</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Watching a movie or TV program with strong sexual references
interferes with people's ability to remember the commercials in such
programs, according to research announced this week.</LD>
<LD>   In the first study to measure empirically whether programming with
sexual content helps or detracts from marketers' messages,
researchers found that people watching shows packed with sexual
innuendo, performers with revealing clothes or sexual scenes were
much less likely to remember the ads both immediately after the show
and a day later.</LD>
<LD>   The steep declines in memory after the shows were seen among
adults of all ages, among both men and women and among those who
liked the programs and those who did not.</LD>
<TE>   If the research is replicated and confirmed, it could mean that
the popular notion that more sex in shows equals more watchers and a
wider response to advertisements is fundamentally flawed.</TE>
<TE>   "If advertisers find out the most popular programs make the ads
less successful, it will revolutionize the TV business," said
Jonathan Freedman, a social psychologist at the University of
Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   The study was reported in the Journal of Applied Psychology and
was conducted by psychology professor Brad Bushman and graduate
student Angelica Bonacci at Iowa State University in Ames. Similar
findings have been reported for violent programs.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers say their work could show advertisers and
programmers that sex and violence do not sell. Perhaps most
tellingly, the effect on memory was seen in people between ages 18
and 25, a group that advertisers covet as malleable consumers and
that programmers try to attract with risque shows.</TE>
<TE>   "The simplest explanation is that people who watch a sexual
program are thinking about sex instead of about the ads," Bushman
said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   "People who watch a violent program are thinking about violence,
not laundry detergent or soda pop. If you don't pay attention to the
ads, you won't encode them in memory," Bushman said.</TE>

<HD>Playing Hide-and-Seek With Conventional Wisdom</HD>
<DH>Movies* The creators of 'Lilo &amp; Stitch' departed from
Disney's animation formulas--a gamble that, they say, was supported
from the top down.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES SOLOMON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At a time when most major Hollywood films seem to be formulaic
additions to one franchise or other, Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois,
the directors of Walt Disney Studios' "Lilo &amp; Stitch," have managed
to make an animated feature that is unconventional, if not downright
quirky.</LD>
<LD>   The story of a destructive alien who crashes on Earth and is
adopted by a lonely little Hawaiian girl, "Lilo" reflects the
personal vision of Sanders and DeBlois. They not only directed the
hand-drawn animated feature, they wrote the script, working from an
idea of Sanders', and storyboarded the entire film.</LD>
<LD>   Ordinarily, those duties would be divided among a dozen or more
artists. But in this time of Disney cutbacks in animation, that was a
luxury the film couldn't afford--and that may have worked to its
benefit.</LD>
<TE>   "We made a commitment to turn out a film that would be unusual,
but that would be made very efficiently," says Sanders. "We knew how
much time and energy could be bled off if the director, writer,
editorial crew and story crew weren't working in perfect sync. We
thought if we could close those gaps, we could make the leading end
of the production much more efficient."</TE>
<TE>   DeBlois says that by sheltering their film from the "levels of
reinterpretation that normally occur during the process," they could
give "Lilo" a consistent voice--for better or worse.</TE>
<TE>   That original voice represents a gamble on Disney's part, even
though Walt Disney's early animated features were considered boldly
innovative when they were released. Conventional wisdom maintains
that modern children have grown so accustomed to formula
entertainment that they won't accept anything that breaks the
familiar patterns. Proponents of this view cite Warner Bros.' "The
Iron Giant," which failed to connect with family audiences despite
being one of the best-reviewed films of 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "Lilo" is also bucking the trend toward computer-generated
animation, which has produced most of the blockbuster hits over the
last few years ("Shrek," the "Toy Story" films). And the film faces
stiff competition through the summer from DreamWorks' animated
"Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron," which continues to do solid
business a month after its release.</TE>
<TE>   DeBlois and Sanders say that from the outset, they had the support
of Disney feature animation chief Thomas Schumacher for "Lilo," which
was produced in the studio's Orlando, Fla., animation facility for
far less than the cost of Disney's recent animated features, and that
he allowed them a great deal of freedom to follow their vision. Says
DeBlois: "I think everyone's aware that the decision-by-committee
approach to filmmaking leads to recycled cliches."</TE>
<TE>   Recalls Sanders: "We took a risk by making this a real, believable
family that had arguments and did strange things: A lot of things
that Lilo does are completely illogical and yet very believable. The
first thing Tom said was, 'I love the damaged nature of this
character,' and from that point on, he was a champion of it and
protected it and created an environment where we knew we were safe to
experiment."</TE>
<TE>   The experiment seems to be working, at least critically; "Lilo"
opened Friday to generally rave reviews.</TE>
<TE>   Although Sanders had toyed with ideas for a children's book about
a Stitch-like monster since 1987, the film grew out of a studio
retreat where executives and artists met to discuss animation and its
future. Many artists expressed a desire to move away from the epic
scale of recent features and make a smaller film that would be closer
in tone to "Dumbo." Sanders pitched his idea to Schumacher, who told
him to start developing it.</TE>
<TE>   The artists had worked together as co-heads of story on "Mulan,"
but it wasn't until "Lilo" was underway that they discovered that
their work habits were distressingly similar. "When it comes time to
storyboard, we both wait until the last second," says Sanders.</TE>
<TE>   "One night Andreas Deja, who animated Lilo, invited us over with
some other people. Suddenly Dean looked at his watch and said, 'Oh,
it's 9 o'clock. I really should get home and start storyboarding so I
can be crying by 2.' And I said, 'What? I do that too!' We start
storyboarding the night before the assignment's due, and by about 2
a.m. we each reach a point where we're sobbing, 'I can't do this.
It's impossible.' "</TE>
<TE>   Although they clearly enjoy each other's company, the directors
offer a study in contrasts. Blond, athletic-looking Sanders radiates
a nervous energy that suggests a toy that's been wound a few turns
too tightly. DeBlois is taller, darker and huskier; he sits quietly
with his hands folded while Sanders fidgets. Yet they worked
comfortably together, with little friction.</TE>
<TE>   "For the most part, we divided the film up sequence by sequence,
and whoever felt passionately about a sequence took the lead on it,"
explains Sanders.</TE>
<TE>   Both artists wanted to push the boundaries and make a film that
would be unlike other recent animated features: no spunky teenage
heroines, no misunderstood heroes, no wisecracking sidekicks, no
scheming villains.</TE>
<TE>   "Neither of us likes slapstick humor very much, and we don't like
cheap sitcom one-liners," says DeBlois. "In 'Mulan,' we felt we
created a character who was very accessible because she wasn't
particularly good at anything. She wasn't born into the aristocracy,
she acted on instinct, she made stupid decisions, she was often
impulsive, yet she had a nobility. We wanted all the characters in
this film to exist in that kind of gray zone without archetypical
heroes and villains."</TE>
<TE>   Sanders agrees: "The scale of a story has nothing to do with the
feelings inside it. We felt a small story would be a better
environment for big feelings and deep feelings. It's harder to
connect with a film where the villain is out to destroy the world
than with a film where a bully tramples the school project some
little kid spent all night working on. We wanted this film to draw on
emotions that are more personal and believable and thus more
powerful."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his other duties, Sanders provided the grunting
noises and guttural voice of the alien Stitch. "When I was a kid, I
used to do this weird voice to entertain myself and to annoy others."</TE>
<TE>   DeBlois suggested that Sanders do that voice on the temporary
soundtrack. When they had to record the final sounds, the directors
felt it would be awkward to ask a "real" actor to squeak and grunt,
so Sanders did. But when the story required Stitch to speak a few
lines of understandable dialogue, he got nervous.</TE>
<TE>   "I really relied on Dean to coach me through it. It's the only
time in my life I really had to act, so it was a very, very tense
moment."</TE>
<TE>   Although DeBlois provided temporary voices for several characters,
his only contribution to the final voice track is an indirect one.</TE>
<TE>   "Dean has a little dog named Theodore that looks a lot like
Stitch," says Sanders. "We brought Theodore in, and he ate cookies
and drank water and grunted and panted and made slobbery noises in
front of a mike. We mixed a little of that in where Stitch is being
horrid and licking stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Sanders and DeBlois would like to see "Lilo &amp; Stitch" initiate a
new era of animation production, in which major studios produce
smaller, more personal works as well as musical adventure-romances.
The watercolor artwork is dazzling, but the animation lacks the
polish and depth of such recent Disney features as "Tarzan" and
"Beauty and the Beast"--and also the price tag.</TE>
<TE>   Although Disney never releases the budgets of its animated
features, sources within the animation industry place the figure at
less than half of the usual $100-million cost of a studio feature
animation release.</TE>
<TE>   DeBlois concludes, "We hope this film opens the door to less
conventional story lines and gutsier storytelling with less financial
risk, because we've proven it can be done."</TE>

<HD>There's Little Spark in HBO's 'Point of Origin'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Point of Origin" is an arson mystery laced with violence and
eroticism, but the biggest surprise is how little heat it generates.</LD>
<LD>   Ray Liotta stars as a Ray Liotta type, a firefighter on the edge,
in this HBO movie inspired by a true story. He plays John Orr, a
veteran investigator from the Glendale Fire Department who hunted a
serial arsonist during a rampage that killed four and caused millions
of dollars of damage across Southern California in the late 1980s.</LD>
<LD>   Designed as a psychological thriller in the style of "Manhunter,"
"Tightrope" and other cop-on-the-edge films--to catch a psycho, you
have to think like one--"Point of Origin" suffers from a predictable
script by Matthew Tabak and excessive razzle-dazzle from director
Newton Thomas Sigel.</LD>
<TE>   Orr, known for his uncanny ability to pinpoint the causes and
points of origin of suspicious fires, is nicknamed "The Professor" by
his enthusiastic protege (John Leguizamo). After surveying the scene
of a blaze, Orr can visualize what happened.</TE>
<TE>   In the smoking rubble of a hardware store fire that police believe
was caused by accident, he knows otherwise and starts assembling a
profile of the sadistic firebug. For one thing, Orr figures, this
torch targets crowded stores so he can watch the victims scurry in
panic from his handiwork.</TE>
<TE>   "This is about ego, not fire," Orr tells his colleagues. "Your
strategy should be to get under this guy's skin."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, this shrewd adversary gets under Orr's skin as
well.</TE>
<TE>   Orr's personal life unravels in the stress of the chase, and as he
carries on an affair with a blase cop (Illeana Douglas) while
neglecting his wife (Bai Ling) and kids, his grip on reality begins
to slip. As his visions get weirder, the question becomes whether he
will crack the case before his sanity cracks.</TE>
<TE>   Liotta and Douglas, both dynamite pros, spark little chemistry in
these roles.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind the points of origin--by the time this film gets to the
last twist you might just wonder: What's the point?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Point of Origin" airs tonight at 8 on HBO. The network has rated
it TV-MA (may be unsuitable for children under age 17).</TE>

<HD>Temptation on Both Sides of the Law</HD>
<DH>In the effective 'Street Time,' debuting Sunday, a parolee
and his parole officer battle demons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOWARD ROSENBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Television's most bountiful genre in weekly drama remains crime,
which multiplies in prime time far out of proportion to its actual
menace to society. How fortunate that it yields some of the small
screen's best work.</LD>
<LD>   Joining this elite group Sunday is "Street Time," a fine Showtime
series about parole officers and parolees, following by just three
weeks the premiere of HBO's superior new crime venture, "The Wire."</LD>
<LD>   "Street Time" broadly tracks "Straight Time," a 1978 film about a
habitual criminal who leaves prison only to return to his old haunts
and be dogged mercilessly by a nasty parole officer.</LD>
<TE>   A major difference is that "Street Time" focuses about equally on
ex-con Kevin Hunter (Rob Morrow) and parole officer Jimmy Liberti
(Scott Cohen). And although Hunter is getting sucked back into drug
smuggling, he's more sympathetic than Dustin Hoffman's parolee in the
movie. Liberti's hassling of him tilts much nearer to job-hardened
tough love than the villainy of M. Emmet Walsh's corrupt parole
officer in "Straight Time."</TE>
<TE>   Hunter and Liberti do not occupy this risky tinderbox alone. While
Hunter is awash in temptation, Liberti is drawn to the evening,
walking streets seething with night crawlers and other activity. Also
prominent are the two men's families, plus Liberti's fellow parole
officer, Dee Mulhern (Erika Alexander).</TE>
<TE>   Watch out, especially, for parolee Sam Cahan (Red Buttons), an
elderly ex-mobster with one wobbly foot in kindly codgerdom, the
other.... Well, let's just say he's a human shell game and that his
battles of wits with Liberti are a twisty highlight of the first
three episodes.</TE>
<TE>   "Street Time" is crime and grime deluxe, its major characters
densely written, its acting excellent from top to bottom, its tone
gray, as if director Marc Levin's fluid camera had consigned to a
smoky haze this urban odyssey created by executive producers Stephen
Kronish and Richard Stratton.</TE>
<TE>   Within this milieu are a pair of protagonists with flaws like
potholes, with Morrow on point as a college-educated felon and Cohen
underplaying persuasively while dotting every I as the complex
Liberti.</TE>
<TE>   The story's catalyst is Hunter's parole and resumption of activity
with his crooked brother and their fugitive pal, coinciding with his
attempt at a relatively normal home life with his common-law wife
Rachel (Michelle Nolden) and their young son.</TE>
<TE>   Rachel is a measure of the show's good writing even for supporting
characters. Not merely another long-suffering spouse, she's blemished
herself, at one point trying to get Hunter as stoned on pot as she
is, while knowing that a drug trace in his required urine tests will
send him back to prison.</TE>
<TE>   Liberti is especially intriguing. From the shadows of his life
comes a cash-eating gambling habit that threatens his family; he also
has a rigid side, as when, his mind on Sept. 11, he stalks and comes
down hard on an Arab parolee he believes to be a terrorist.</TE>
<TE>   "It really bothers me the way you lump people together," says his
boss (Allegra Fulton). "My grandparents were lumped together once, on
a cattle car in Poland."</TE>
<TE>   That strong third episode rebounds from a second one, whose pace
slows notably. Levin is too cute with some of his transitions in the
premiere, moreover, as when fast-cutting from a thug breaking down a
door to Liberti's son in a karate match. Plus, having Hunter and
Liberti encounter each other while walking their sons to the same
school seems just too convenient.</TE>
<TE>   A more significant parallel is executed masterfully, for both
parolee and parole officer are demon-battling junkies, one apparently
hooked on crime, the other on gambling.</TE>
<TE>   "I get my money, and I'm done," Hunter insists when reluctantly
agreeing to one last drug score with his brother. "I'm through,"
Liberti assures his bookie later, after collecting his winnings.</TE>
<TE>   The likelihood that neither is through makes "Street Time" all the
more seductive.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Street Time" premieres at 10 p.m. Sunday on Showtime. The network
has rated it TV-MA (may be unsuitable for children under the age of
17).</TE>

<HD>Canceled 'Adventures in Television': Was the Hook Too
Quick?</HD>
<DH>Perhaps it was too much of an inside joke, television
spoofing television. Whatever the reason, it had precious little time
to find an audience.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALLAN JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ABC's hapless "My Adventures in Television" certainly has lived up to
its name (its second), and in the process has become a case study in
how a network series fails.</LD>
<LD>   Most recently scheduled for 9:30 p.m. Wednesdays, it was removed
abruptly from the ABC schedule Monday and replaced with "Drew Carey"
reruns.</LD>
<LD>   This echoes its original debut as a replacement sitcom on the fall
schedule, when it aired only twice under the name "Wednesdays 9:30
(8:30 Central)" before ABC pulled it for low ratings, changed the
name and rescheduled it for after the May sweeps to work off its
remaining four episodes amid the new "reality" and game shows that
dot the summer listings.</LD>
<TE>   The last original episode was scheduled to air July 3, but this
time it looks as if the hook will be final, illustrating once again
how a television sitcom with bright prospects becomes perceived as a
failure and is quickly discarded.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, "Wednesdays" was a look at the backbiting world of
network TV, as seen through a fresh-faced executive (Ivan Sergei) of
fictional network IBS (nice initials!).</TE>
<TE>   Rival exec Mike McClarren (James McCauley) tells David Weiss
(Sergei) there's "only one thing you need to know about this
business: Everybody is lying." Weiss swears that won't be the case
with him, but on his first day on the job, he does just that to Lori
Loughlin ("Full House"), who is on a fictional IBS sitcom--and whom
he winds up sleeping with. She later tells him she hasn't had sex
with a network exec "this season."</TE>
<TE>   The comedy was seen by about 7 million viewers on March 27 and
April 3.</TE>
<TE>   ABC quickly decided it wasn't going to grow from these perceived
low numbers, and the rest, as they say, is history.</TE>
<TE>   "Wednesdays" (the confusing original title quickly was considered
symptomatic of the show's inability to connect with viewers) failed,
as do most new network shows, but not in the eyes of Peter Tolan, the
show's creator, who also produced "The Larry Sanders Show" and "The
Job."</TE>
<TE>   "We had a great time," he says.</TE>
<TE>   And in the eyes of some, the show isn't that bad. "I thought it
was funny and insightful and a little goofy, and I was going to keep
watching it," says Michael Niederman, chairman of the television
department of Columbia College Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   There were even some television critics around the country who
considered it promising.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the idea of trying to do a television spoof on
television," says USA Today television critic Robert Bianco. However,
Bianco also says the comedy "failed for all the reasons that sitcoms
fail all the time. It wasn't funny enough, and it was silly where it
should have been sharper and smarter. It was indifferently cast,
other than John Cleese [as the head of IBS]. It had no strong voice
and no point of view about what it was satirizing."</TE>
<TE>   And it had absolutely no chance to address its weaknesses. In the
current ad-starved economy, no TV network can afford to grow a series
slowly. Part of this show's bad luck was in appearing on ABC, the
"sick man" of TV programming. ABC finished the recent season in third
place behind NBC and CBS with a 9.7-million-viewer average, a loss of
almost 3 million viewers from a year ago. The top creative executives
were sacked and next fall's mission will be to avoid being overtaken
by Fox and dumped into fourth place.</TE>
<TE>   "They're desperate at this point," Tolan says. "And desperation
leads to shows being on for two weeks." (ABC, more intent on
trumpeting its fall schedule than talking about a canceled series,
wouldn't comment.)</TE>
<TE>   Niederman notes that ABC is just the most extreme example. With
cable, the Internet, DVDs and more competing for viewers' attention,
all networks usually can't wait for a show to find an audience, even
if it might eventually be there.</TE>
<TE>   Coming up with some guidelines a sitcom should follow for success
isn't foolproof, because there are too many variables, says
Chicago-based sitcom and sketch comedy writer Michael Fry.</TE>
<TE>   "I can tell you five or six things that I think should be in a
great sitcom, but there are sitcoms that have applied these things
and still get canceled," says Fry, a former writer for "The Fresh
Prince of Bel-Air" and "The Parent'Hood."</TE>
<TE>   "It's such a fickle marketplace. And television is a purely
sponsor-driven medium. You can put together a terrific sitcom and get
great reviews, like 'Sports Night' by Aaron Sorkin, and still get
canceled."</TE>
<TE>   Some felt what doomed "Wednesdays" was that much of the humor was
insider jokes about an industry every viewer thinks he knows, but
whose actual workings may be unfamiliar.</TE>
<TE>   For example, one joke was made at the expense of a young
television network head named Jordan Levin. But there is such an
executive, who runs the WB network.</TE>
<TE>   "When I interviewed Peter Tolan," says Eric Deggans, TV critic for
Florida's St. Petersburg Times, "I mentioned the joke about Jordan
Levin. And I understand his point that viewers will understand that
it's just some young guy who's promising. But it wasn't that funny."</TE>
<TE>   Tolan admits the show "may be" too insider for a mainstream
audience, but Bianco disagrees.</TE>
<TE>   "It could have been any office comedy, which was more of the
problem than anything," Bianco says. "Nobody looked at 'The Mary
Tyler Moore Show' and said that was too inside about TV news, because
it worked."</TE>
<TE>   Fry says the series showed an underbelly of Hollywood he thought
viewers were too uncomfortable watching.</TE>
<TE>   "People do not understand, nor really want to know, about all the
dirt that's behind the shows that they depend on to cheer them up,"
he says. "It's like seeing a clown smoke a cigarette."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Niederman felt "Wednesdays" had that intangible something
that could have meant success, which he finds interesting given the
show's abrupt fate.</TE>
<TE>   "In trying to look inside that world," he says, "the only thing I
can guess is sometimes people don't like jokes being made about them.
So having TV executives decide the fate of a program about TV
executives maybe wasn't so good a scenario."</TE>

<LD>Mark Swed correctly pointed out ("Truly Operatic," June 15) the
problems with sight lines in "Turandot," but I can add that this has
been a problem in at least three of the four productions of Los
Angeles Opera this season. It raises the question of whether the
designers, directors and company in general have a general disdain
for the balcony-sitters (although it appears that even those in the
orchestra section couldn't see around the pillars).</LD>
<LD>   There really is no reason for not placing the entire production in
full view of the entire audience. Overcoming limitations of stage
layout is the challenge ably met by the best designers. It seems to
me that sight problems could be easily avoided if someone sat in the
balcony during the design phase.</LD>

<HD>Once-Powerful Fetishes Open the Door to Their World</HD>
<DH>In 'Fetish: Art/Word,' contemporary works are juxtaposed
with African artifacts in a look at the power of symbols and the
history of the word.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PAGEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not many people know the etymology of the word "fetish," but if
anyone ever called you a fetishist, you probably didn't take it as a
compliment. Even if you weren't sure exactly what the word means, its
dismissive tone was probably enough to convince you that its speaker
had no respect for something near and dear to your heart.</LD>
<LD>   At the UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History, a small exhibition
juxtaposes a handful of antique African artifacts with a smattering
of contemporary artworks to outline the way the word "fetish" has
been used or misused over the last 600 years. Titled "Fetish:
Art/Word," the handsome show was organized by graduate student Nizan
Shaked. It begins clearly but gets muddled as it moves into the
present.</LD>
<LD>   The oldest objects are three solid gold mid-19th century ornaments
made by the Asante, an Akan people who live in what is now Ghana.
Although these embossed pieces resemble a necklace and a pair of wide
bracelets, small holes at the edges of two suggest they were once
attached to stools.</LD>
<TE>   Wall-labels and a well-written pamphlet inform visitors that the
decorative patterns hammered into the gold often represent proverbs,
tales and riddles that formed an essential part of Asante history and
identity. But rather than providing a single example of one of these
stories (or even stating that their meanings have been lost), the
exhibition's educational texts take us further back in time.</TE>
<TE>   In the 15th century, gold ornaments like these were among the
first items Portuguese traders and clergymen called fetisso or
fetiche. With roots in the Portuguese feitico, meaning magical
practice, and the Latin factilius, denoting artificiality, the term
was derogatory. It went hand-in-glove with European imperialism,
which squashed various forms of idolatry and culture in order to
extend the domain of scientific rationality, not to mention
capitalist economics.</TE>
<TE>   But the way the Asante ornaments are displayed makes the
imperialists appear to be the real fetishists. Set in velvet-lined
leather cases that have been handcrafted in the shape of their
contents, these pillaged treasures are treated like rare jewels whose
value is enhanced by their mysteriousness. To the Asante, however,
they were not mysterious. They were powerful. There's a big
difference.</TE>
<TE>   The people who originally used them knew exactly what stories they
told and how they functioned. But the British, who shipped these
examples to England when they sacked the Asante capital in 1874,
didn't. They either melted them into ingots or ensconced them in
decorative cases. Torn from their social fabric and stripped of their
power, they became exotic emblems, mute souvenirs of a way of life
that was being vanquished.</TE>
<TE>   The point of this half of the exhibition is that the word "fetish"
was coined by outsiders, who did not have an intimate relationship
with the objects they appropriated. A dozen carved wood figures--made
by the Yombe and Songye peoples in the late 19th and early 20th
centuries in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo--drive the
point home.</TE>
<TE>   Ranging in height from 6 inches to 4 feet high, they originally
functioned to resolve social disputes, negotiate deals between
generations and enhance individual and collective fortune. People
cemented their ties to a community by nailing strips of cloth to
some, stuffing symbolic objects into small packs carried on the backs
of others and encasing personal mementos in the glass-covered bellies
of still others.</TE>
<TE>   Today, these figures function as fascinating time capsules,
windows to a world that looks magical from our perspective but was
perfectly normal to those who lived in it. Visually, they're the
highlight of the show. Adorned with shells, feathers, mirrors and the
hides and horns of animals, they carry the silent wishes of the
people who first used them.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't take a great leap of the imagination to see the
connection between these enchanting artifacts and the eight
contemporary works of art. All were made as vehicles for the desires
of their users. All promote public interaction, representing the
aspirations and fantasies of social groups. And all live or die by
their capacity to have consequential effects on the lives of people
who come into contact with them.</TE>
<TE>   But that's not how the exhibition links them. Rather than relating
the contemporary works to the African artifacts, it argues that the
eight contemporary artists use their works to analyze the idea of
fetishism. Which is exactly what the first half of the show does.
"Fetish: Art/Word" claims that there is no fundamental difference
between making a work of art and organizing an exhibition.</TE>
<TE>   In this way, it ignores the visual power of the best contemporary
works, which are more like the Asante, Yombe and Songye artifacts
than the curator lets on.</TE>
<TE>   Only the weakest works make fetishism their subject. Mary Kelly
(Shaked's instructor) has printed four diagrams about the topic from
psychoanalytic textbooks on four baby shirts and encased them in four
shallow plastic boxes. Barbara Bloom has printed dozens of copies of
her signature on two sheets of Letraset. And Naomi Talisman has
photographed three shiny metal squares held between the lips of an
anonymous sitter.</TE>
<TE>   In order to ensure that no one mistakes what they have made for
fetishes, all strive to eliminate mystery from their works. But such
rationality doesn't generate powerful art. Their tedious pieces
merely illustrate academic ideas.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, sculptures by Marcel Duchamp and Yayoi Kusama make
fun of all forms of fetish analysis. Duchamp's "Objet-Dard" is a limp
lump of plaster covered with a golden coat of galvanized metal.
Kusama's "Silver Shoes" consists of 27 unmatched shoes from which
sprout lumpy forms that resemble life-size sweet potatoes, tiny
rhinoceros horns and overgrown moles. If either of these pieces could
speak, it would say "Yeah, I'm a fetish, but that tells you next to
nothing about me." At once sexy and silly, enigmatic and obvious,
each is more fascinating than anything said about it.</TE>
<TE>   The works by the remaining three artists are not about fetishism
at all.</TE>
<TE>   Renee Petropoulos' doughnut-shaped painting is an abstract
portrait of her grandmother. Monica Majoli's sensuous depiction of a
small cut on someone's bare abdomen embodies the risks and thrills of
extreme devotion. And a painted lithograph by Lari Pittman (also on
the faculty at UCLA) is a multilayered Pop pictograph. Depicting an
upside-down owl (the symbol of wisdom) with large ears, ample breasts
and a pair of pure white hearts peeking out from behind, it tells
viewers to look for meaning by turning knowledge on its head and
remembering that love counts.</TE>
<TE>   The only way to diminish the effect of these potent pieces is to
pretend that they prefer detached analysis to subjective engagement.
That's tantamount to treating them as fetishes--exotic objects that
are mysterious because they are misunderstood.</TE>
<TE>   Contemporary art is a fetish only to people who don't know it
intimately and insist on keeping their distance from its real power.</TE>

<HD>Tale of Blood Ends With a Dire Warning</HD>
<DH>'Red Gold,' a compelling PBS documentary series, builds
from a slow start to a frightening forecast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If your knowledge of that liquid life called blood has not been
updated since the classic Disney-Frank Capra-Bell Labs documentary
"Hemo the Magnificent," you might take a look at "Red Gold: The Epic
Story of Blood," which begins Sunday on PBS.</LD>
<LD>   Based on Douglas Starr's acclaimed book, "Blood: An Epic History
of Medicine and Commerce," this strong, compelling, four-part series
by WNET-TV in New York explores the myths, mysteries and challenges
of blood from ancient times until today.</LD>
<LD>   "Red Gold" ends with an ominous warning: Mad cow disease in
Britain and new restrictions on the importation of blood from Europe
threaten to undermine decades of progress in the U.S. blood bank
system at a time when New York imports 25% of its blood from Europe
and 4.5 million would die annually in the U.S. without transfusions.
What's worse, after an initial surge in the wake of the Sept 11
terrorist attacks, blood donations have dropped.</LD>
<TE>   But "Red Gold" does more than just deliver the bad news about the
future. It also dissects the hard work--and folly--of centuries of
schemers and dreamers who pondered what to do with this red stuff
that so captivates us.</TE>
<TE>   Take Galen, the Roman physician who did his groundbreaking blood
observations while serving as team doctor to the gladiators.</TE>
<TE>   "The bloody business of mortal combat gave Galen a unique insight
into the human body," says the narrator.</TE>
<TE>   If "Red Gold" ends with a sock to the belly--the blood supply
crisis, the AIDS catastrophe, the imperialistic conduct of U.S. blood
gatherers in the Third World--it starts somewhat languidly in Episode
1, "Magic to Medicine."</TE>
<TE>   Faculty politics at the University of Padua during the Renaissance
are interesting, but only mildly so, as is the bloodletting of a
dying George Washington.</TE>
<TE>   A more journalistic approach might have worked better: Lead with
the newest stuff, then go back into the history.</TE>
<TE>   The stronger half of the Sunday package is Episode 2, "Blood and
War," a look at how 20th century carnage forced innovations in the
collection, storage and distribution of blood to save lives.</TE>
<TE>   Among the gems is a mini-profile of Janet Vaughn, a British doctor
who bucked the establishment during World War II and ended using a
converted ice-cream truck to deliver blood for Londoners hurt by the
German terror bombing. She believed in the storage of blood for
emergencies when others did not.</TE>
<TE>   "Science is exciting," says a chipper Vaughn. "I don't think
people understand that."</TE>
<TE>   Episode 3, "Tainted Blood," chronicles the rise of blood as big
business, including the opening of 10 plasma collection shops on skid
row in L.A. that lured donors with chits good for cheap booze. The
U.S. had become the "OPEC of plasma."</TE>
<TE>   "Red Gold" suggests that the 1979 downfall of the Nicaraguan
dictator Anastasio Somoza may have been hastened by popular anger at
the "house of vampires," a U.S.-owned plasma center.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes a phrase like "blood feud" is more than a metaphor.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The first two episodes of "Red Gold: The Epic Story of Blood" can
be seen Sunday from 9 to 11 p.m. on KCET-TV and KVCR-TV. The second
two can be seen June 30 at the same times.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stand back: The "Monster Garage" is open. Lurking inside are
powerful, mechanically altered machines that will never be for sale
on a used-car lot.</LD>
<LD>   "Monster Garage" is the Discovery Channel's new four-part series,
premiering with two episodes Sunday from 9 to 11 p.m. It concludes at
the same time Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The series features renowned custom motorcycle builder Jesse James
of Long Beach as its host. James, who says he is a descendant of the
Old West outlaw, rounds up a gang of mechanics, welders, hydraulics
experts, painters and graphic artists for each vehicle
transformation. He prods the group into completing the job in one
week, offering expensive tool sets to all as an incentive.</LD>
<TE>   You don't have to be a mechanic or a blowtorch professional to
enjoy the series. Its opening episode, titled "Ford Explorer/Garbage
Truck," has wide appeal. It is entertaining, with deadpan humor that
borders on high camp.</TE>
<TE>   At first glance, some members of James' team, which includes a
tattoo artist, look like they barely passed high school auto shop,
but when they turn a 1993 Eddie Bauer Ford Explorer into a trash
collector, equipped with a hydraulic system that powers a metal arm,
a rooftop-hinged door and a trash-smashing compactor, they show
imagination and ingenuity to rival NASA engineers.</TE>
<TE>   The episode concludes with the Explorer challenging a 10-wheel
L.A. city garbage truck to a trash-collecting duel.</TE>
<TE>   The other installments focus on a limousine that becomes a fully
functional fire engine with a pressure hose; a floating Volkswagen
Beetle/swamp airboat; and a Mustang GT fitted with lawnmower blades
that cut grass at 60 mph.</TE>

<HD>Adelphia May File Chapter 11 Monday</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cable operator Adelphia Communications Corp., facing regulatory and
criminal probes for its accounting practices, may file for bankruptcy
protection as early as Monday, sources familiar with the matter said
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The company is close to an agreement to borrow up to $1.5 billion
from a group of banks led by J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and Citigroup
Inc. for debtor-in-possession financing, which is designed to keep a
company solvent while it works to restructure under Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection.</LD>
<LD>   Adelphia's board is expected to meet Sunday. A source close to the
company said that not all the financing arrangements are in place and
that they could still unravel.</LD>
<TE>   Adelphia, under federal investigation over its accounting
practices, has been on the verge of bankruptcy since defaulting on
more than $7 billion in bank debt and missing more than $100 million
in interest and dividend payments. Lenders have held off demanding
repayment, a move that would have forced a filing sooner, as the
company tried to line up new loans.</TE>
<TE>   "Bankruptcy was made for this company," said Van Greenfield, a
managing member of Blue River, which holds Adelphia preferred stock.
"It needs a timeout from all the allegations to avoid having a death
spiral in its value."</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission and two federal grand
juries are investigating Adelphia after the company guaranteed more
than $3 billion in loans to partnerships run by founder and former
Chief Executive John Rigas and his family. Rigas stepped down last
month, and other family members have left the company in recent
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia, the nation's sixth-largest cable operator, probably will
bring in new management and shed some assets after the expected
Chapter 11 filing, investors said. The company has been trying to
sell about half its assets, including cable systems in Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Brazil's Bonds, Currency Take Renewed Hit</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Stocks also drop as concerns rise on fears
the country is losing access to capital and on election worries.
Other Latin markets fall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>SAO PAULO, Brazil</DL>
<LD>Brazil's bonds, stocks and currency led declines across emerging
markets on concern Latin America's largest country is losing access
to capital markets and may have trouble paying its debts.</LD>
<LD>   Brazil's 8% bond maturing in 2014 fell 1.37 cents to 57.13 cents
on the dollar, yielding almost 21%, up from 20.3% on Thursday,
according to J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. Friday's yield on the benchmark
bond was the highest since early 1995, in the wake of Mexico's
currency crisis.</LD>
<LD>   The Bovespa stock index dropped 4.7% to 10,397.55, its lowest
since Oct. 9. The real dropped 1.2% to 2.83 per dollar, its weakest
since Sept. 21.</LD>
<TE>   "There's contagion across emerging markets," said Carlos Rojas,
money manager at Rimac Internacional in Lima. "Even Mexico and Russia
had the flu."</TE>
<TE>   Investors, unnerved by Argentina's $95-billion default in
December, are selling Brazilian securities on concerns that leftist
presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva would raise spending
and abandon a low-inflation policy in search of faster growth if he's
elected in October. He has a wide lead in polls.</TE>
<TE>   Also scaring the markets was the announcement that Argentina's
central bank President Mario Blejer will resign five months after
taking over the post. Central bank Vice President Aldo Pignanelli
will take over the bank temporarily after the resignation June 30.</TE>
<TE>   The plunge in Brazilian securities has raised concern the country
is losing access to capital markets, making it hard for companies and
the government to refinance debts. Brazil's $330-billion public debt
dwarfs that of Argentina, accounting for three-quarters of gross
domestic product.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds, stocks and currencies tumbled across the region for a
second day as investors sold securities in a bid to limit potential
losses in Latin America. Investors are worried soaring interest rates
in Brazil may make it hard for companies and the government to meet
obligations after Oct. 6 elections.</TE>
<TE>   "The view of international investors toward Brazil is
catastrophic," said Rodrigo Campos at Opportunity Asset Management.
"They don't understand well the mechanism Brazil uses to roll over
the debt. They just see we have a huge debt, high interest rates and
a great political risk this year."</TE>
<TE>   Brazilian asset prices tumbled to their lows for the day after
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said the U.S. would oppose more
International Monetary Fund aid for Brazil. He said the two-month
slump in the country's financial markets was due to political
concerns, not economic ones.</TE>
<TE>   "Throwing the U.S. taxpayers' money at a political uncertainty in
Brazil doesn't seem brilliant to me," O'Neill said.</TE>
<TE>   Finance Minister Pedro Malan said in a speech Friday that Brazil's
economy is sound and that declines in the country's bonds may be more
closely related to sinking U.S. markets.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing really happened on the real side of the Brazilian economy
in the past weeks that would justify a surge in the Brazilian
sovereign risk," Malan said. "I wouldn't dismiss the possibility that
some of this selling, mainly the larger volumes in most-traded bonds
for emerging markets, is associated with soaring default rates in the
U.S. corporate debt market."</TE>
<TE>   Brazil's central bank president, Arminio Fraga, acknowledged that
his efforts to stem declines in currency and bonds by selling
dollars, exchanging Treasury bills and keeping interest rates high
have failed so far. "The market hasn't reacted yet the way I would
like it to," he said at a news conference in Sao Paulo. "The central
bank has been acting daily and adjusting its policies."</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican peso declined 1.2% to 9.93 per dollar, while its stock
index dropped 1.2% to 6,502.97. In Argentina, the peso fell 2.1% to
3.67 to the dollar and the Merval stock index fell 2.4% to 313.11.
Chilean and Peruvian currencies also dropped.</TE>

<HD>Recall Pressure Rises Against Ford</HD>
<DH>Autos: 10 police officers in Arizona have died in fiery
crashes in Crown Victorias. Firm says fuel system is safe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRON LEVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ford Motor Co. is under mounting pressure to recall hundreds of
thousands of Crown Victoria police cruisers amid reports of
rear-collision gas tank fires in which at least 10 police officers
have died since 1992.</LD>
<LD>   Ford, the dominant producer of police cars, faces what amounts to
a boycott in Arizona, where emotions reached the boiling point last
week with the fiery death of a policeman in the Phoenix suburb of
Chandler.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Nielsen, 25, became the third police officer in Arizona to
die in less than four years when the fuel tank of his Crown Victoria
burst into flames after a crash. An officer in the state survived a
similar crash last year but suffered burns over most of his body.</LD>
<TE>   Nielsen's death "was the final straw," said Det. Tony Morales of
the Phoenix Police Department, which immediately suspended an order
for 200 new Crown Victoria cruisers. Rather than wait for Ford to
act, Phoenix plans to install new, and purportedly safer, fuel
systems in the 735 Crown Victorias in its fleet.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona Gov. Jane Dee Hull has told the state highway patrol not
to place new orders with Ford until the issue is resolved.</TE>
<TE>   Ford executives said that the cruisers have a great safety record,
and that their fuel systems meet the federal government's minimum
standard, as well as the company's tougher internal guidelines. Ford
said the tank fires are so rare and involve such violent
collisions--typically 70 mph or faster--that they do not reflect a
design problem.</TE>
<TE>   The Crown Victoria "is one of the safest vehicles you can be in,"
and "there are no safety issues with the fuel system," said Ford
spokeswoman Sara Tatchio.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona Atty. Gen. Janet Napolitano is scheduled to meet Tuesday
with top safety executives of Ford in Dearborn, Mich. In a stern
letter in March to Ford Chairman William Clay Ford Jr., Napolitano
said the company's failure to take "affirmative action ... is highly
disturbing."</TE>
<TE>   Tatchio declined to say what may come out of the meeting with
Napolitano--only that Ford plans "to do what's right."</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very important business to us," Tatchio said. "Police
work to keep us safe, and we want to make sure we're working to keep
them safe in their vehicles."</TE>
<TE>   Ford also faces a class-action lawsuit in New Jersey that seeks
reimbursement to police departments for safety modifications.</TE>
<TE>   The growing flap has featured complaints of foot-dragging by
federal auto safety officials, who have been investigating the cars
since November but waited several months before opening their probe.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began its
investigation after receiving a copy of an internal Ford memo stating
the agency had agreed not to investigate.</TE>
<TE>   With about 80,000 of the cruisers sold each year, Ford has 85% of
the police market. About half a million of the cars, known as Crown
Victoria Police Interceptors, are on the road.</TE>
<TE>   The car is a more powerful version of the regular Crown Victoria
and has essentially the same fuel system as other Ford Panther
platform cars--including the Mercury Grand Marquis and Lincoln Town
Car.</TE>
<TE>   The car's gas tank is behind the rear axle rather than above or
forward of the axle, which is a safer location, according to safety
groups and lawyers for families of dead officers.</TE>
<TE>   According to these critics, the design is marginal at best for
civilian owners and unsuitable for cars marketed to police, who face
the risk of getting rammed from behind when they stop on road
shoulders to direct traffic or help motorists. Some, though not all,
of the deaths and injuries from burns have occurred under this
scenario.</TE>
<TE>   The tank "is in a bad location, so what did they do to protect the
tank? They did nothing," said Glenn C. McGovern, a lawyer for the
family of Hung Le, a Louisiana state police officer who allegedly
burned to death after being rear-ended in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   In October, Ford issued a service bulletin advising repair shops
to change a bolt and a metal tab that are thought to have punctured
or ripped fuel tanks in some of the wrecks.</TE>
<TE>   Critics called the action inadequate, noting that Ford did not
notify all police and civilian owners and did not agree to pay for
the modifications as it would do in a formal recall.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, they said, the fixes are too minor to solve the problem.
They have called on Ford to add protective shields or install new
tanks with a bladder, or protective inner liner, as Phoenix plans to
do.</TE>
<TE>   Ford has resisted, saying the measures might create safety
problems, such as a shield that might puncture the tank in a crash.</TE>
<TE>   Although the debate has become more shrill in recent days, the
controversy has been around for years.</TE>
<TE>   In August 1999, the Florida Highway Patrol sent Ford a report of a
yearlong investigation of rear-collision fires. The report
highlighted the tank's behind-the-axle position and suggested
reinforcement with a safety shield or bladder.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, after two Arizona police officers were killed and a
third severely burned, the head of the state Fraternal Order of
Police demanded in a letter that Ford "stop ignoring the problem and
fix it, even if these vehicles need to be recalled."</TE>
<TE>   A ticklish issue for Ford is how to reach an accord with police on
safety improvements without having to do the same for civilian cars.
Along with at least 10 reports of police burn deaths in the last
decade, there have been several reports of similar fatalities of
civilians in Panther platform cars.</TE>
<TE>   For their part, NHTSA officials aren't saying when they might
complete their investigation. The agency began receiving reports of
fuel tank fires from plaintiffs' lawyers and safety groups early last
year.</TE>
<TE>   An NHTSA document dated June 5, 2001, said the agency had reports
of six deaths and two injuries and recommended opening an
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   But for reasons that have not been explained, the probe did not
begin for nearly six months. An internal Ford memo said that in July
2001, Ford executives had spoken to NHTSA and "got an agreement NHTSA
will not open" an investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, the memo was obtained by David Perry, a Texas lawyer
who represents some of the fire victims. He sent it to NHTSA in late
October. The investigation began the following month.</TE>
<TE>   Allan J. Kam, a former senior attorney for NHTSA and a consultant
to Perry, said NHTSA officials must have been "disturbed to learn
that a manufacturer had asserted that NHTSA had made such an
agreement."</TE>
<TE>   But NHTSA Administrator Jeffrey Runge could not be reached for
comment, and agency spokesman Rae Tyson said NHTSA's investigation is
continuing and "we have nothing further to say about it at this
point."</TE>

<HD>Gemstar's Patent Strategy Backfires</HD>
<DH>Cable TV: Judge finds misuse and rejects programming firm's
infringement claims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A complaint filed by Gemstar-TV Guide International Inc. to protect
its patents backfired Friday, undermining the company's ability to
dominate the electronic programming arena.</LD>
<LD>   An administrative law judge for the International Trade Commission
ruled that the Pasadena-based company misused one of its patents. The
judge also rejected a claim that Pioneer Electronics Inc.,
Scientific-Atlanta Inc. and EchoStar Communications Corp. had
infringed three patents by importing set-top cable boxes using
competing guide software.</LD>
<LD>   The case brought by Gemstar in February 2001 revolved around
technologies for navigating through program listings on television
screens--the electronic equivalent of TV Guide.</LD>
<TE>   "There has been no violation" of international trade regulations
concerning patents, Administrative Law Judge Paul Luckern stated in
his ruling.</TE>
<TE>   The ramifications of the ruling were not immediately clear because
only the conclusion of Luckern's decision was made available, and it
offered no details about how Gemstar misused its patent. The judge's
complete 461-page decision is expected to be released next week.</TE>
<TE>   The five-member trade commission is scheduled to review Luckern's
recommendation and vote on the matter in October. But analysts said
Luckern's ruling on its own could seriously undermine one of
Gemstar's key growth strategies and hurt its ability to sign new
contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "The scope of the victory for the respondents is surprising," said
Lowell Singer, an analyst at Robertson Stephens. "This will impair
Gemstar's ability to compete and also raises questions about
contracts signed with other cable companies."</TE>
<TE>   The company has become the dominant supplier of guide software to
the cable and satellite industry on the strength of its more than 150
U.S. patents covering the on-screen guide technologies.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar's interactive programming guide is available in about 15.7
million homes, including 8.2 million with cable set-top boxes and 7.5
million that have the guide incorporated in their TV sets. Its
biggest cable customers include AT&amp;T Broadband, Comcast Corp. and
Charter Communications Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "We're obviously disappointed," said Jonathan Orlick, chief legal
officer and general counsel for Gemstar.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's ruling will not detract from the company's long-standing
policy to assert patents against infringing parties."</TE>
<TE>   Although much of Gemstar's $1.4 billion in annual revenue comes
from its TV Guide magazine, the company's future is based on
licensing the electronic programming software to cable and satellite
companies and selling advertising on that platform.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts believe that consumers someday will get most of their
information about what to watch on television from electronic rather
than printed guides. Indeed, the circulation of TV Guide has steadily
declined as the number of TV channels has grown.</TE>
<TE>   Even before Friday's ruling, Gemstar had been beset by a series of
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Relations with cable and satellite operators had been strained by
Gemstar's reputation for using its patents as a way to force
potential customers to sign contracts for the guide.</TE>
<TE>   Those that resisted risked being sued by Gemstar, which has
several pending patent infringement cases in California and Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   "This [victory] should have a very persuasive impact on those
other cases," said Paul Dempsey, president of business solutions at
Pioneer, a manufacturer of set-top boxes. "We feel very vindicated."</TE>
<TE>   Singer said the judge's decision made it less likely that Gemstar
could sign deals with new customers including AOL Time Warner, Cox
Communications, DirecTV, Scientific-Atlanta and EchoStar that account
for more than 40 million households worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar shares are down 70% this year because of
slower-than-expected deployment of digital set-top boxes that use its
guides, questionable accounting practices by the company and a
destabilizing feud between the company's top two shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar shares rose 10 cents to $8.20 on Nasdaq on Friday.
After-hours trading was halted before Luckern's decision was issued.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar's complaint sought to block imports of certain
program-guide equipment and components from countries such as China,
Japan, Malaysia and Mexico. It said rival companies were stealing
Gemstar's technology to challenge its dominance in an industry it
helped create.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar had counted on winning the case. It was so confident, in
fact, that it had booked about $114 million in revenue from
Scientific-Atlanta, accrued since the set-top box manufacturer
stopped paying license fees to Gemstar when its contract expired
about two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The aggressive accounting maneuver created friction between
Gemstar's controlling shareholder and Chief Executive Henry Yuen and
the company's leading outside investor, News Corp., which owns about
42% of the company.</TE>
<TE>   News Corp. chief Rupert Murdoch forced Yuen to disclose the
accounting practice to investors when he learned about it in March,
causing the stock to plunge and damaging the company's credibility on
Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   News Corp.'s holdings, valued at about $7.5 billion in 2000, after
the company merged its TV Guide with Gemstar to become a major
shareholder, are worth about $1.4 billion today.</TE>
<TE>   Sources say the patent ruling will further fray relations between
Murdoch and Yuen.</TE>

<HD>Australian Firm to Buy Skateboard Company</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>An Australian shoemaker plans to acquire El Segundo-based Kubic
Marketing Inc., one of the world's largest skateboard companies, in
the latest effort to push the edgy sport of skateboarding into the
mainstream and commit deeper corporate dollars to fuel its growth
globally.</LD>
<LD>   Globe International Ltd. plans to pay up to $46 million to buy
Kubic, parent of bad-boy brand World Industries, the companies said
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The acquisition will move another large corporation into Southern
California's once tightly knit youth market scene, while adding
another dose of corporate respectability to a sport that was born of
rebellion. Earlier this year, Beaverton, Ore.-based athletic shoe
giant Nike Inc. purchased Hurley International, a Costa Mesa-based
youth apparel designer that is popular with skateboarders and
surfers.</LD>
<TE>   Globe, which already distributes a stable of youth brands in
Australia, will issue about 47 million shares to raise money for the
purchase. The acquisition is expected to spur production of apparel
and shoes bearing Kubic brands, which include Blind, Darkstar, Tensor
and enjoi. It also allows Globe to move into skateboard and hard
goods in a major way, insiders said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big deal," said Miki Vuckovich, editor of Transworld
Skateboarding magazine. "It's a great opportunity for [Globe] to own
several of the top brands they've been distributing. They can now
control the licensing, distribution and how those brands are managed
globally."</TE>
<TE>   The deal also will strengthen the Kubic brand and could make life
tougher for companies that make skate shoes, including Santa Fe
Springs-based Vans Inc. and Sole Technology Inc. in Lake Forest,
industry insiders said.</TE>
<TE>   Management will remain in place at Kubic's two divisions, World
Industries and Dwindle Distribution, and no layoffs are anticipated,
the company said. Other than planned expansion, nothing is likely to
change, said Robert Valerio, Dwindle's president.</TE>
<TE>   "They're still going to appeal to youths' interest in rebelling,"
he said. "We're just happy to have a larger parent company that can
fund our growth."</TE>
<TE>   "We are joining up with one of the largest shoe companies in
skateboarding," Valerio added. "That means together we have the
opportunity to be one of the leaders in the action sports industry
for the entire world."</TE>
<TE>   The popularity of skateboarding has grown steadily in recent
years, swiping some of the sheen from the surf wear apparel market.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the nation's 16 million skateboarders--or skateboard
wannabes--generated $1.4 billion in sales, up 27% from the year
before, according to Skateboarding Business Magazine. Those numbers
don't include lower-priced boards sold by mass merchants such as
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Toys R Us Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Kubic claims to be the world's largest high-end, hard-goods
skateboarding company. It has 20% of the market for skateboards
priced more than $100, Valerio said.</TE>
<TE>   As the sport infiltrated suburbia and rolled into middle America,
more businesses tried to reap profits from it, pouring money into the
industry and cranking out clothing and shoes geared to skaters.</TE>
<TE>   Kubic was founded 15 years ago by professional skateboarders Steve
Rocco and Rodney Mullen. Then called World lndustries, it operated
for years in Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   As the brand gained favor with youths, World irked parents with
skateboard designs featuring crack pipes, decapitated babies and the
pope on fire.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, an Orange County couple led a letter-writing campaign
against World over a promotion that offered a free board to people
who "relinquish their souls."</TE>
<TE>   As it grew, the company also had difficulty with product
shortages, which at times cost it sales. Globe's heft and experience
should help going forward, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Globe has a pretty strong global network and could probably aid
World in the globalization of their hard goods," said Mitch Kummetz,
an analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities.</TE>
<TE>   The purchase will not change how Kubic's brands are distributed,
which largely has been through small stores that sell surf and skate
products, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   But Kummetz said Globe may broaden the distribution of World
Industries shoes for youth by selling them in large department
stores, such as J.C. Penney Co., Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., and Kohl's
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "If you really want to go after kids' shoes, I believe you have to
go through department stores and the moderate chain retailers," he
said. "Now they have the muscle behind them to go after it."</TE>

<HD>Marriott Sells Stake in Laguna Project</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE HARRIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marriott International Inc. said Friday that it sold its majority
interest in the new Laguna Beach Colony hotel for $190 million, the
highest per-room price paid for a U.S. hotel this year.</LD>
<LD>   The purchase by Laguna Beach Resorts eliminates Marriott as owner
and developer of the 30-acre, 260-room hotel--a Craftsman-style
resort under construction atop a 50-foot ocean bluff that is being
billed as the crown jewel of Southern California's "Gold Coast" of
luxury properties that stretch from Orange County to San Diego.</LD>
<LD>   "Our business model has long been in managing hotels, not owning
them," said Marriott spokesman Roger Conner, noting that of 2,600
hotels Marriott manages worldwide, only a handful are owned by the
Bethesda, Md.-based company. "In this case, clearly, it was
economically lucrative for us to proceed with the sale."</LD>
<TE>   The buyer is a partnership of Montage Hotels &amp; Resorts and Athens
Group, which is the original developer of the project.</TE>
<TE>   The price per room paid by the buyers is estimated to be about
$538,000--excluding land costs--which is the highest in the U.S. this
year and nearly double the highest in California last year, said Alan
Reay, president of hotel brokerage firm Atlas Hospitality Group. The
purchase price includes 14 lots for single-family homes and 14
condominiums that also are part of the resort complex.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Fuerstman, who formed Montage Hotels &amp; Resorts this year,
will oversee operation of the hotel, which is being renamed Montage
at the Laguna Beach Colony. Fuerstman is former vice president of
operations for the Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas. Before that he
managed the Phoenician in Scottsdale, Ariz., which under his
direction achieved status as one of the top U.S. resorts.</TE>
<TE>   "The city of Laguna Beach obviously wants a five-star operator at
the new property, and that's certainly what they're getting,"
Fuerstman said Friday. "It is absolutely a world-class piece of real
estate, and it is destined to be the most magnificent resort ever to
grace Southern California."</TE>
<TE>   Word that a purchase was in the works began spreading last month,
when Athens Group asked the city to modify its contract to give more
flexibility in choosing an operator that would maintain high
standards, said Laguna Beach Mayor Wayne Baglin.</TE>
<TE>   Marriott, the largest U.S. hotel firm, recently said it sold a
405-room Courtyard in San Francisco and a 347-room hotel in
Bridgewater, N.J., in a deal for about $143 million. It has sold
about $300 million in assets so far this year.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts and hotel industry experts said the sales are not
particularly unusual for Marriott, and called the Laguna Beach Colony
deal a sound move in an unsure market.</TE>
<TE>   By this time next year, dozens of new resorts either will be open
or under construction in Southern California and such a rapid surge
in supply could be problematic, said Donald Wise of Wise Hotel
Investments in Newport Beach. Since Sept. 11, the luxury hotel market
has taken a 25% hit in occupancy rates..</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, we don't know what's going to happen in this market
over the next couple of years," Wise said. "So for Marriott to bow
out now is actually perfect timing. They're selling the sizzle, not
the steak, because they're selling the future."</TE>
<TE>   The Laguna Beach resort is scheduled to open early next year.</TE>

<HD>Kaiser Chief Shakes Up Division</HD>
<DH>HMO: Amid restructuring, Chairman George Halvorson has
eliminated the California unit, forcing its president to leave by
month's end.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his first major move since taking the helm of Kaiser Permanente,
George C. Halvorson has engineered an organizational restructuring
that has effectively forced out the president of Kaiser's California
division.</LD>
<LD>   Kaiser said Friday that Dick Pettingill, the HMO's top operational
executive in California since 1999, will be leaving at the end of
this month. Kaiser said Pettingill resigned after Halvorson, the
chairman and chief executive, decided to eliminate the California
division and return to a structure of having a top manager in
Southern California and one in the north.</LD>
<LD>   Pettingill, who has been a prominent member of California's
health-care industry, helped to oversee Kaiser's financial turnaround
in recent years. But under his leadership, Kaiser's image was bruised
from a protracted battle with regulators over allegations that Kaiser
did not assess or treat ill patients in a timely manner.</LD>
<TE>   Kaiser spokeswoman Beverly Hayon declined to say whether that had
anything to do with Pettingill's departure.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Halvorson lauded Pettingill for his leadership and
major contributions. Pettingill made no statement through Kaiser, and
he could not be reached for comment. Kaiser said the restructuring is
intended to streamline operations and will not result in staff
reductions.</TE>
<TE>   Under the reorganization, Kaiser's eight regions will report to
headquarters in Oakland. Kaiser, the state's largest HMO, has more
than 6 million members in California and more than 2 million in eight
other states.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser said Dr. Bill Gillespie, executive vice president for
patient safety and clinical information systems, also has decided to
leave the organization. Dr. Louise Liang, chairwoman of the Institute
for Health Improvement, will replace him.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Leon D. Crandall, president of Kaiser
Permanente, announced he was leaving. But that was expected after
Halvorson's arrival in May.</TE>
<TE>   Pettingill's departure surprised observers. Pettingill, who joined
Kaiser in 1995, was seen as a public face of the HMO in California.
Although Kaiser has not clashed any more often with regulators than
other HMOs, it has been in a long-running battle with the Department
of Managed Health Care over a $1.1-million fine for alleged lapses in
patient care. Kaiser has challenged the fine, and the case is
pending.</TE>

<HD>New Woes, Old Story as Stocks Reel</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Major indexes decline for a fifth week as Merck
and Rite Aid accounting troubles compound fears over terror and weak
dollar.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Big-name U.S. stocks tumbled Friday, sending major indexes to their
fifth straight weekly losses and knocking the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
below 1,000 for the first time since September.</LD>
<LD>   Rising Mideast tensions, new warnings of possible terrorist
attacks in the U.S., deepening declines in the dollar and new
questions about corporate accounting sent blue-chip shares reeling.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow industrials sank 177.98 points, or 1.9%, to 9,253.79,
while the Nasdaq composite dropped 23.79 points, or 1.6%, to
1,440.96.</LD>
<TE>   Drug shares helped fuel the sell-off after the Wall Street Journal
reported that a unit of pharmaceutical giant Merck, a component of
the Dow, used an accounting method considered more aggressive than
those used by its rivals. Merck fell $2.22 to a four-year low of
$49.98, Pfizer fell $2.05 to $34.03, and Abbott Labs dropped $1.54 to
$36.13.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day it seems there's something new, and today it's Merck,"
said John Carey, manager of the Pioneer Fund. "I don't know if the
story is that big a deal, but it adds to the level of distrust. It's
another log on the fire."</TE>
<TE>   In a reminder of the Enron fiasco, current and former Rite Aid
executives were charged with what the Securities and Exchange
Commission called one of the most egregious accounting frauds ever.</TE>
<TE>   Investors also were unnerved by new clashes between Israelis and
Palestinians, and by the latest FBI warning: The agency said
terrorists could use fuel tanker trucks to attack American targets
domestically or overseas.</TE>
<TE>   In currency trading, the dollar plunged to a 26-month low against
the euro and to a seven-month low against the Japanese yen as
confidence in U.S. assets waned. The euro surged to 97.1 cents from
96.5 cents on Thursday, while the dollar dropped to 121.43 yen from
123.37.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar's drop in recent weeks has spooked some, but Stuart
Freeman, chief equity strategist at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons, called it
"normal for this point in the economic cycle" and said the decline
should eventually boost earnings for multinational companies in the
S&amp;P 500.</TE>
<TE>   But on Friday sellers dominated, clipping 1.7% off the S&amp;P. The
index closed at 989.14, its lowest since Sept. 21, the day stocks
bottomed after the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Heavy trading volume coincided with the quarterly "triple
witching" expiration of stock index futures, index options and
options on stocks.</TE>
<TE>   The S&amp;P and Nasdaq could be one or two down days away from
piercing their multiyear lows of 965.80 and 1,423.19, respectively,
set Sept. 21.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some strategists called the market's downside limited. Phil
Dow, managing director at RBC Dain Rauscher, said the second-quarter
earnings season was shaping up well, with a relatively low rate of
profit warnings to date. S&amp;P 500 profit overall is expected to rise
3% to 6% in the quarter from a year ago, he said.</TE>
<TE>   For the week, the S&amp;P 500 lost 1.8%, leaving it down 13.8% year to
date; the Dow sank 2.3%, leaving it off 7.7% in 2002; and Nasdaq
plunged 4.2%, widening its loss to 26.1% for the year.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the latest spate of bad news, so-called window dressing
exacerbated the sell-off late in the week, strategists said, as some
money managers dumped losing stocks to make their portfolios look
better at the end of the quarter, which ends next Friday.</TE>
<TE>   But the broader market has held up better than
capitalization-weighted indexes such as the S&amp;P 500. The Russell
2,000 index of smaller stocks inched 0.2% higher Friday and is down
5.6% year to date. Even within the S&amp;P 500, 50 of the 102 industry
groups tracked by Bloomberg News gained ground during the week.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday market breadth was mildly negative, with losers
outnumbering winners by about 9 to 7 on the New York Stock Exchange
but running about even on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   In the bond market, Treasury yields eased Friday as investors
sought safety in government debt. The yield on the benchmark 10-year
note eased to 4.77% from 4.79% on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Among other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Widely held stocks paced the selling. Microsoft lost $1.82 to
$52.28; GE fell 75 cents to $28.95; Wal-Mart Stores slid $1.52 to
$54.98; and IBM dropped $2.83 to $68.75 after Lehman Bros. analyst
Daniel Niles cut earnings estimates for the computer giant.</TE>
<TE>   Some stocks bucked the downtrend. Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond rose $1.76 to
$36.26 after reporting a surge in quarterly profit; Xerox jumped
$1.12 to $8.97 after renegotiating a $7-billion credit line.</TE>

<HD>Merrill Lynch Puts 2 Employees on Leave</HD>
<DH>Probe: The broker and his assistant handled a trade of
ImClone Systems stock for Martha Stewart.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. has suspended the broker who handled a trade for
Martha Stewart of shares of ImClone Systems Inc., a biotech company
whose former chief executive has been arrested on securities fraud
charges.</LD>
<LD>   In a statement released Friday, Merrill Lynch said it had put
Peter Bacanovic and his assistant, Douglas Faneuil, on paid leave
following an internal investigation.</LD>
<LD>   "There is some information that we discovered that we thought
should be turned over to the authorities for their evaluation," a
Merrill spokesman said. "It is not to say that these guys necessarily
did anything wrong."</LD>
<TE>   Bacanovic is the broker for ImClone co-founder and former CEO
Samuel D. Waksal and his daughter Aliza, as well as Stewart. Waksal
was charged June 12 with insider trading.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my understanding that Merrill Lynch uncovered some
discrepancies in the statements of these two employees as they
prepared to meet with our investigators next week," said Ken Johnson,
a spokesman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which is
investigating the ImClone case.</TE>
<TE>   "This action only confirms our suspicions that we are on the right
track and getting very close to the truth," he added.</TE>
<TE>   The committee asked Merrill Lynch in a letter Friday for several
documents related to the sale of ImClone stock by the firm's clients.</TE>
<TE>   The documents sought include trading records for all Merrill
brokers for ImClone stock from Dec. 3-Dec. 28, as well as telephone
records and client records of Bacanovic. The House investigators also
are seeking the names of Merrill Lynch employees who assisted
Bacanovic in trades of ImClone stock.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said Stewart was not the focus of the investigation, "but
we continue to pursue leads relating to public statements she has
made."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart has come under scrutiny by congressional investigators and
federal prosecutors over the sale of nearly 4,000 shares of ImClone
on Dec. 27, a day before federal regulators said they would not
consider the company's new cancer drug. ImClone's shares plummeted
after the news came out.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart has said her trade was perfectly legal and based on
information available to the public at the time.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Stewart did not immediately return a phone call
seeking comment on the suspension of the broker.</TE>
<TE>   Waksal, a friend of Stewart who once dated her daughter, allegedly
tipped off two people to sell ImClone stock before the drug
application was thrown out.</TE>
<TE>   Bacanovic is reported to have said that he and Stewart decided
after Dec. 10--not late November as Stewart told congressional
investigators--to sell shares of ImClone if the price fell below $60
a share.</TE>
<TE>   The timing of the discussion is crucial in determining whether
Stewart had nonpublic information about ImClone. By early December,
some top officials at ImClone knew that things were not looking good
for the application approval for the promising drug.</TE>

<HD>Panel Backs OTC Sale of Prilosec</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: The FDA is likely to follow the advice, a
boost for the popular AstraZeneca drug, which is facing generic
competition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Food and Drug Administration advisory committee on Friday
recommended that the heartburn remedy Prilosec, one of the world's
bestselling prescription drugs, be sold to consumers over the
counter.</LD>
<LD>   The FDA is not bound by the panel's advice but usually follows it.
The recommendation means that AstraZeneca, Europe's No. 2 drug maker,
is a step closer to preserving some market share for a blockbuster
drug that is facing competition from generic manufacturers.</LD>
<LD>   Prilosec, whose main patent expired in October, has brought
AstraZeneca $26 billion in sales since it was introduced in the U.S.
in 1989.</LD>
<TE>   The FDA action is significant for consumers and employers who have
complained about high Prilosec prices. The over-the-counter version
might cost one-fourth as much as the prescription version.</TE>
<TE>   The move to make Prilosec an over-the-counter drug, which was
initiated by Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and AstraZeneca through an
agreement in which P&amp;G will market the drug, could undercut its
generic competitors. Those rivals are locked in a bitter court fight
over the patents for prescription Prilosec. The fight also
illuminates the strategy of a powerful pharmaceutical company
fighting to preserve profit until it can bring another blockbuster
drug to market.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said P&amp;G and AstraZeneca would split profits 60-40,
favoring AstraZeneca.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA panel voted 16 to 2 in favor of the recommendation but
added two caveats: It wanted a more clearly defined label for the
nonprescription version and proof that consumers would understand how
the drug is to be used and for what purposes. The panel also
suggested just two or three 14-day regimens of the drug over the
course of a year. The lone consumer representative on the panel voted
against an over-the-counter version, fearing that advertisements
would persuade too many people to try it.</TE>
<TE>   The prescription version of Prilosec is the familiar, $4 purple
capsule prescribed for heartburn, acid reflux and erosion of the
esophagus that can occur in severe cases. At its height in 2000,
Prilosec accounted for $6 billion in one year of worldwide sales.
Sales last year were $3.7 billion in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   With so many blockbuster drugs at or nearing the end of their
patent protections, brand-name drug companies have employed a variety
of strategies to fend off generic competition.</TE>
<TE>   AstraZeneca has taken a three-pronged strategy on Prilosec based
on the knowledge that generics could eat up 80% of Prilosec sales in
a year or less, according to analysts who follow the company.</TE>
<TE>   First, AstraZeneca is running an aggressive direct-to-consumer
advertising campaign that is pushing new customers and current
Prilosec users to Nexium, a new version of the drug that the company
says is superior.</TE>
<TE>   The company also is suing four generic competitors in federal
court in New York--Andrx Corp., Merck KGaA, Schwarz Pharma  and Dr.
Reddy's Laboratories Ltd.--arguing in part that the capsule's coating
is integral to the drug's effectiveness and also deserves patent
protection.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, AstraZeneca is making a bid to bring the first of this
type of heartburn medication to drugstore shelves, where Prilosec
would compete not only against a future generic version but also
against traditional antacids such as Tums and nonprescription
medications such as Pepcid and Zantac.</TE>
<TE>   Andrea Hotz, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, said the effect
of an over-the-counter version of Prilosec competing against a
generic version would be "neutral to slightly positive" to
AstraZeneca's bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   "That maybe adds 1 cent in earnings per share over a year. It
would be higher, 4 cents a share, if a generic version does not come
to the market," Hotz said. She added that one benefit of an OTC
version would be to draw more customers to other AstraZeneca
heartburn drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Andrx Chief Executive Dr. Elliot F. Hahn said he expected at most
a minimal effect on sales of a generic version of Prilosec. Andrx and
GenPharm International are the two companies that share the lucrative
first rights to market the generic equivalent to Prilosec for six
months before other competitors can step into the market.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Coyne, AstraZeneca's senior manager of public affairs for its
gastrointestinal group, said the OTC version of Prilosec would be a
magnesium salt tablet with the same prescription strength--20
milligrams once a day--as the Prilosec prescribed by doctors.</TE>
<TE>   AstraZeneca shares closed at $40.35, up 64 cents. Procter &amp; Gamble
shares were unchanged at $93.85.</TE>

<HD>International Rectifier Stock Falls 26% After Downgrade</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>International Rectifier Corp. shares tumbled 26.4% Friday after a
downgrade by an analyst who said the company's fiscal 2003 guidance
was too aggressive.</LD>
<LD>   Banc of America Securities analyst Doug Lee downgraded the stock
of the El Segundo semiconductor maker to "underperform" from "market
performer," arguing that its financial guidance for the fiscal year
ending June 2003 is too aggressive. Lee said in a note to clients,
however, that he was not concerned about the company meeting guidance
it gave for the current fourth quarter.</LD>
<LD>   After Lee's comments, the company issued a statement saying that
it sees no change to the guidance it gave in April, when it forecast
a 10% rise in fourth-quarter revenue from $178.6 million in the third
quarter. However, the company did not reiterate its earlier guidance
for fiscal 2003, which called for revenue to rise about 35%, rather
than the 25% to 30% it had previously forecast.</LD>
<TE>   That was enough to send investors to the exits. The company's
shares fell $9.85, to close at $27.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts, on average, now expect International Rectifier to earn
$1.59 a share in fiscal 2003, up from an estimated 75 cents a share
this fiscal year, according to Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   International Rectifier, whose chips manage power in electronic
devices, also said it expects fourth-quarter gross margin, or the
percentage of revenue left after subtracting product costs, to widen
about 1 percentage point from 35.1% in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts expect International Rectifier to earn 23 cents to 26
cents a share, with a consensus of 25 cents, on revenue of $196.1
million in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson.</TE>
<TE>   Lee noted the difficulty in gauging the operations of three recent
acquisitions and their effect on results because "very few details
... have been revealed to investors."</TE>
<TE>   Lee also said that 38% of its revenue in the third quarter came
from what International Rectifier deems the information technology
end-markets, and that this sector continues to suffer from depressed
spending.</TE>
<TE>   The stock has also "performed incredibly well over the past
several quarters," Lee wrote, rising 7% this year, compared with a
25% decline in the benchmark Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.</TE>
<TE>   Because the stock has outperformed the index by such a wide
margin, and because of his concerns about an earnings shortfall over
the next year, Lee asserted that the stock is likely to fall to $25
to $30.</TE>

<LD>Leaders of United Airlines' flight attendant union rejected a company
proposal seeking a 5% wage cut, jeopardizing parent UAL Corp.'s
tentative agreement on concessions from pilots.</LD>
<LD>   A tentative agreement reached this week with pilots on a 10% pay
cut is contingent on United securing concessions from other unions.
UAL has said it needs to reduce costs to stem losses and to help win
support for a federal loan guarantee. The deadline to apply for the
guarantee is June 28.</LD>

small companies warned him he was under investigation, authorities
said.</LD>

stashing money in bank accounts in Lebanon after former FBI agent
Jeffrey Royer told him late last year he was being investigated by
federal authorities, Assistant U.S. Atty. Kenneth Breen told U.S.
District Judge Raymond Dearie. Breen asked Dearie to hold Elgindy
without bail.</LD>
<LD>   Elgindy also kept a "getaway stash" of $43,000 in cash, along with
jewels, gold coins and a passport, in his office safe in San Diego,
Breen said.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two former top executives of battery manufacturing company Exide
Technologies were convicted of scheming to sell defective merchandise
to thousands of consumers during the 1990s.</LD>
<LD>   Arthur Hawkins, 59, of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and Douglas
Pearson, 58, of New Hope, Pa., were found guilty of wire fraud and
conspiracy to commit wire fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Hawkins, a former Exide president, and Pearson, the company's
former vice president of North American operations, lied to secure a
large contract with Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. in 1994, prosecutors said.</LD>
<TE>   Former Chief Financial Officer Alan E. Gauthier, 54, of
Flemington, N.J., pleaded guilty to the charges early in the trial.
The three were fired in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said they bribed a Sears merchandise buyer to sell
batteries they knew were defective. Thousands of the batteries were
sold nationwide under the Die-Hard brand name until Sears broke ties
with the company in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government launched an investigation in 1998 after a
former Exide employee told officials about the payments.</TE>

<LD>Verizon Communications Inc.'s Bell Atlantic unit and other Baby Bell
local telephone companies may be subject to federal antitrust suits
by consumers complaining of inferior service, a U.S. appeals court
ruled.</LD>
<LD>   The decision by the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals opens the
Baby Bells to lawsuits by retail customers who may collect triple
damages if they succeed. Until now, only competitors were allowed to
bring antitrust claims over poor service against companies such as
Verizon, the biggest U.S. local phone provider.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling conflicts with another federal appeals court decision,
setting the stage for a review by the Supreme Court.</LD>

<HD>Merck Shares Drop on Medco Report</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Merck &amp; Co. said its Medco unit acted properly when it booked revenue
from patient co-payments to pharmacies that it never collected, but
its shares fell on a report that questioned the practice.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of Merck fell $2.22 to $49.98 on the NYSE, their lowest
level since late 1997.</LD>
<LD>   Merck declined to comment on how the report about its Merck-Medco
unit might affect the company's planned spinoff of about 20% of Medco
through an initial public offering, which Wall Street expects next
week.</LD>
<TE>   Pharmacy benefits managers such as Medco ensure that only drugs on
an insurance company's list of approved medications are dispensed by
pharmacies--a role meant to help keep drug expenses affordable.</TE>
<TE>   CareMark Rx, one of Medco's rivals, also recognizes co-payments as
revenue and defended that arrangement, saying the practice was
consistent with generally accepted accounting methods. But its stock
was off 45 cents at $17.34 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>R.J. Reynolds Ordered to Pay Smoker $15 Million</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge awards punitive damages to man who lost his
legs. Firm says amount is excessive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRON LEVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge in Kansas City, Kan., issued a scathing ruling Friday
against R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Inc., ordering the cigarette
maker to pay $15 million in punitive damages to a former smoker who
lost his legs to a circulatory disease.</LD>
<LD>   Amid a string of courtroom losses for the tobacco industry, the
ruling by U.S. District Judge John W. Lungstrum in some ways was more
of the same. But the award to former Camel smoker David Burton, 67,
was the first punitive damage award against a tobacco firm in federal
court, where stricter rules of evidence generally favor the defense.
And Lungstrum was savage in describing Reynolds' conduct, using such
words as "nefarious" and "insidious" to describe it.</LD>
<LD>   "It is not for making a dangerous product that [Reynolds] should
be punished," Lungstrum said in his ruling. "It is for concealing how
dangerous the product is that R.J. Reynolds merits punishment.... The
fact that Reynolds concealed the addictive nature of tobacco is
particularly nefarious."</LD>
<TE>   Executives with Reynolds, the second-leading U.S. cigarette maker
behind Philip Morris Co., called the award "excessive and
unwarranted" and said they would appeal. "As we showed during the
trial, Reynolds Tobacco had no information about smoking and health
that wasn't publicly known during the entire time that ... Mr. David
Burton smoked," said Daniel W. Donahue, senior vice president and
deputy general counsel.</TE>
<TE>   In February, Burton, a former janitor and railroad worker who
suffers from peripheral vascular disease, was awarded $196,416 in
compensatory damages by a federal jury, which further ruled that
Reynolds should pay punitive damages in an amount Lungstrum would
determine.</TE>
<TE>   He heard arguments last month on punitive damages, leading to his
Friday ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Before the verdict in February, cigarette makers had never lost a
case in America's conservative Midwestern heartland, had never lost a
case in federal court and had never been found liable in a case
involving circulatory disease.</TE>
<TE>   Tobacco companies are appealing six other pending punitive damage
awards in California, Oregon or Florida. Some analysts have suggested
that the industry's legal problems are confined to these areas of the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's ruling "underscores the reality that, regarding tobacco
litigation, the major tobacco companies are not facing a 'West Coast'
problem; they face a reprehensibility problem," said Edward L. Sweda
Jr., a senior attorney with the Tobacco Products Liability Project,
an anti-smoking group in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Reynolds executives, noting that the punitive award was about 75
times as great as Burton's compensatory damages, said the decision
ran afoul of suggestions by the U.S. Supreme Court that such damages
be in reasonable proportion.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, tobacco companies suffered their first defeat
in a secondhand smoke case when a Miami jury awarded $5.5 million to
Lynn French, 56, a flight attendant who was found to have developed
chronic sinus problems from breathing the air in smoky airline
cabins. She is one of nearly 3,000 flight attendants bringing
individual claims against the industry under terms of a 1997
class-action settlement.</TE>

<HD>Dell, Qualcomm Expect to Meet Profit Estimates</HD>
<DH>Earnings: Maxtor, the No. 1 computer disk drive maker,
warns of wider-than-anticipated loss on price reductions and less
demand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two technology titans, PC maker Dell Computer and cell phone giant
Qualcomm Inc., said Friday that they expected to meet or beat
earnings projections in the current quarter.</LD>
<LD>   But Maxtor Corp., the world's biggest computer disk drive maker,
said it expected a wider-than-forecast second-quarter loss and
lowered its sales estimate, blaming price cuts and less demand</LD>
<LD>   Dell spokesman Mike Maher said the No. 2 PC maker, which is based
in Round Rock, Texas, was "on course and we have not changed our
guidance."</LD>
<TE>   Dell said in May that it would have $8.2 billion in revenue and 18
cents earnings per share in its fiscal second quarter ending in July.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Chief Executive Michael Dell was quoted as saying that
his company had not seen the soft computer demand noted by other
companies in the industry, such as Apple Computer Inc. and
microprocessor makers.</TE>
<TE>   Shares in Dell closed up 5 cents at $23.98 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego-based Qualcomm said it expected earnings in its fiscal
third quarter to meet or exceed the high end of its previous
forecast, boosted by strong demand for its advanced wireless
technology that lets cell phone users surf the Web, swap pictures and
download music.</TE>
<TE>   Qualcomm had said it expected earnings for the quarter ending June
30 of 21 cents to 23 cents a share, excluding its strategic
investment unit and special charges.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street analysts, on average, had expected 22 cents a share,
according to Thomson First Call. The company posted earnings of 23
cents in the year-earlier third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Investors have expressed skepticism that Qualcomm will meet
forecasts after this quarter, in part because they say not enough
U.S. consumers will want new phones. Qualcomm may be benefiting from
a push by mobile phone carriers Sprint PCS and Verizon Wireless Inc.
to sell flashier handsets with color screens and faster Web access.</TE>
<TE>   Qualcomm shares closed off 21 cents at $26.12 on Nasdaq in a weak
market on turnover of almost 29 million shares.</TE>
<TE>   Maxtor said its loss would be as much as $90 million, or 38 cents
a share, excluding some costs, on sales of $880 million to $910
million. The shortfall doesn't include goodwill amortization from the
$340.1-million purchase of Quantum Corp.'s hard-drive business last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Some hard-drive makers are cutting prices and buying rivals
because sales of their data storage devices have slumped. Computer
makers, including Maxtor customers Dell, Apple and Gateway Inc.,
don't expect sales to rise for the rest of 2002. Hitachi Ltd. said
June 4 that it would buy IBM Corp.'s hard-drive business for $2.05
billion.</TE>
<TE>   "The magnitude was a surprise," said Hoefer &amp; Arnett analyst Mark
Miller, who owns Maxtor shares and cut his rating to "hold" from
"buy." Customers such as Hewlett-Packard Co., EMC Corp. and Dell are
demanding price breaks from suppliers such as Maxtor amid declining
sales, Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   Maxtor was expected to have a loss of 24 cents a share on sales of
$982.7 million, the average forecast of analysts surveyed by Thomson
First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Maxtor's profit estimate doesn't agree with generally accepted
accounting principals.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Shares Hit Low on Stock Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal's shares tumbled to their lowest level in more than
five years Friday after Deutsche Bank disclosed a complex stock
repurchase plan with the French entertainment company.</LD>
<LD>   In a deal reported to French market regulators Thursday, Vivendi
sold 12.7% of its water utility, Vivendi Environnement, to Deutsche
Bank on June 12 on the condition the entertainment giant buy back the
shares at a later date.</LD>
<LD>   Such stock repurchase agreements allow companies to raise cash by
borrowing money against the value of their shares. Vivendi said
Friday it was getting financing at a favorable rate.</LD>
<TE>   The unusual transaction fueled speculation among some investors
and analysts over whether Vivendi Universal was facing a cash
squeeze.</TE>
<TE>   Investors also wondered whether the arrangement would delay plans,
approved by Vivendi Universal's board on Monday, to sell 15% of
Vivendi Environnement to reduce the parent company's hefty
$30-billion debt load.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi wouldn't say how much it raised from the sale.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it still has 3.3 billion euros in available
credit from banks.</TE>
<TE>   Such assurances didn't sway investors who on Friday bailed out of
companies with high debts and complex accounts in a broad sell-off in
Europe. Vivendi Universal's shares on the Paris Bourse fell 8% to
their lowest level since September 1996.</TE>
<TE>   On the New York Stock Exchange, Vivendi's American depositary
receipts fell $2.11 to $23.21. Vivendi's shares have fallen 57% on
the NYSE this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Their track record is one that people just don't believe what
they say," said Michael Nathanson, an analyst with Sanford C.
Bernstein, citing $1.3 billion in off-balance-sheet liabilities that
Vivendi disclosed earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   "We as investors don't want to see any more complicated deals ...
with Vivendi," Nathanson said.</TE>
<TE>   The stock repurchase may delay Vivendi's plan to give up control
of its utility subsidiary but doesn't necessarily mean the company is
in a cash crunch, said Neil Blackley, an analyst with Merrill Lynch.
Credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's recently removed Vivendi from
its negative watch list.</TE>
<TE>   "They've given them a clean bill of health," he said.</TE>

<HD>Care Is Compromised by State's Nurse Shortage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>According to an American Hospital Assn. report, there are 126,000
nursing vacancies nationwide. A recent New England Journal of
Medicine article links this nursing shortage with an increase in
patient deaths and illnesses. KAREN KARLITZ spoke with a staff member
of the largest registered nurses association in California to learn
more about this problem and its resolution.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   DIANE HIRSCH-GARCIA</LD>
<TE>   Labor representative, California Nurses Assn.</TE>
<TE>   About 10 years ago, hospitals and medical corporations began
buying up other hospitals; emphasis shifted to meeting the bottom
line rather than providing quality patient care. That's when
unlicensed "assistive" classifications (groups of people given
minimal training to perform various tasks previously done by nurses)
began to sprout.</TE>
<TE>   Economic changes and changes in insurance coverages have also
resulted in people coming into the hospital who are sicker.</TE>
<TE>   Registered nurses are supposed to be patient advocates, but
because of working with large numbers of assistive personnel, nurses
found themselves unable to advocate successfully for safe patient
care. Nurses' stress levels intensified as bad outcomes for patients
increased; many RNs chose to leave the profession. At the same time,
fewer people were starting nursing careers.</TE>
<TE>   A big concern is the ratios regulating the number of patients
assigned to each nurse. In critical care units, nurses follow one or
two patients. But in other areas of the hospital, the number of
patients cared for by each nurse keeps growing. Compounding this
problem is that many patients who previously would have been placed
in intensive-care units are shifted to other sections of the
hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The California Nurses Assn. initiated a drive for better ratios
throughout hospitals with Assembly Bill 394. Gov. Gray Davis signed
this bill, but because of a required period of public hearings the
new ratios may not be implemented until as late as July 2003. In all
of our contract facilities, we are demanding that these ratios be
implemented now.</TE>
<TE>   Today, many more nurses are becoming members of collective
organizations like the CNA. Their issues include the problem of
recruiting and retaining nurses and the implementation of livable
retirement pensions. Most hospitals don't provide pensions for
nurses. But at the UC hospitals, RNs receive good pensions through
the state. These hospitals also have the lowest nurse turnover rates.
Retirement plans, nurse-to-patient ratios and salaries are key to
bringing nurses back into the field and retaining them.</TE>
<TE>   The nursing shortage affects patient care. At most hospitals, we
see patients not getting the care they need. Nurses are working
overtime to pick up the slack, but the workload of unlicensed
assistive classifications has also dramatically increased.</TE>
<TE>   Temporary or traveling nurses are being employed as well, but the
people doing these jobs have no loyalty to the hospital, don't come
back the next day for continuity of patient care and may or may not
have the skills necessary to work in the units where they are placed.
Sometimes, however, they make up the majority of the staff.</TE>
<TE>   Some nurses are advising people to stay with their loved ones in
the hospital to augment patient care. This isn't standard advice, but
it is being given more often, especially for patients recovering from
heart attacks or surgery in hospitals where nurses are assigned 10 or
more patients. These family members or friends sleep in the hospital.
Some hospitals have facilities for this. If they don't, many just
sleep in chairs. This obviously isn't a long-term solution to the
problem of an inadequate number of nurses.</TE>

<HD>Workers Lacking Health Insurance Need a Fair Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTA ZAMORA</AU>
<BD>Marta Zamora lives in Corona.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What's wrong with this picture? I make $25,000 a year working for a
small company that sells party supplies, and I cannot afford health
insurance for my family. U.S. Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV, a West
Virginia Democrat, makes at least $145,000 a year in salary--and is
worth millions personally--and he gets tax-free health insurance
through the federal government.</LD>
<LD>   But Rockefeller--who favors universal health insurance through a
government-run system--is blocking a bill in the Senate that would
provide a tax credit for people like me to purchase affordable health
insurance.</LD>
<LD>   It would be funny if it weren't so absurd. It would be funny if it
weren't so crucial for me, like 39 million other Americans, to insure
my family.</LD>
<TE>   Rockefeller is blocking a bill that is supported by members of
both parties in both houses of Congress. In the Senate, his
colleagues Zell Miller (Ga.) and Robert Torricelli (N.J.) are the
lead Democratic co-sponsors of the bill, along with Sen. Rick
Santorum (R-Pa.). In the House of Representatives, there are 17
Democratic co-sponsors of the same legislation.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, the Fair Care for the Uninsured Act, has broad appeal,
crossing party, regional and ethnic lines.</TE>
<TE>   It is especially popular among minorities, because minorities make
up a disproportionately high percentage of uninsured people in this
country.</TE>
<TE>   I happen to be Latino, and according to the U.S. Census, Latinos
are the largest minority group of uninsured people--one out of every
three Latinos is uninsured. About one out of every five African
Americans is uninsured as well.</TE>
<TE>   Fair Care provides up to $3,000 for families that do not receive
health insurance through their employers. It's called Fair Care
because it promotes health-care equity by providing benefits to low-
and middle-income uninsured workers.</TE>
<TE>   It would permit millions of Latinos and other minorities to have
access to preventive and routine health care and avoid costly
emergency room visits like the one I had last year.</TE>
<TE>   I spent four hours in the emergency room of a local hospital. A
prescription and two medications later, the hospital charged me more
than $7,700.</TE>
<TE>   Now I avoid the health care system because I am afraid of the
cost. It was actually cheaper for me to fly to Mexico to see a
holistic doctor.</TE>
<TE>   If I had had health insurance, I could have seen a mainstream
doctor rather than choosing between Mexico and the emergency room.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics may charge that $3,000 is not enough money to insure
a family for a year. They would be wrong. Here in Southern
California, I can buy health insurance for my family for $204 a
month. Fair Care provides $250 a month for a family, so I would have
enough money to cover the entire cost of health insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Fair Care is an excellent way to provide access to affordable
health insurance for millions of families.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has provided tens of billions of dollars in his
budget for Fair Care. One millionaire senator shouldn't be able to
deprive millions of working families the same access to care that he
enjoys.</TE>

<HD>Living a Monk's Life at Chinese Temples in a Quest to
Expand the Soul</HD>
<DH>JOURNEY TO HEAVENLY MOUNTAIN: An American's Pilgrimage to
the Heart of Buddhism in Modern China; By Jay Martin; Hohm Press: 244
pp., $16.95 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE MEYER</AU>
<BD>Mike Meyer is a writer at work on a memoir of his
travels through the Middle Kingdom.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Daytime visitors to China's Buddhist temples often walk away feeling
anything but spiritually cleansed. Fleeced is more like it. The
nation's ancient religious tradition, the Communist Party's official
atheism and a burgeoning market economy have produced a wealth of
restored temples that are at once revered, rebuked and
revenue-generating.</LD>
<LD>   At night, however, Chinese temples become themselves again, or at
least the best version of themselves that they can. After the tour
buses depart and the stall-holders pack up, the smell of incense
overpowers that of cash; tranquillity replaces bustle.</LD>
<LD>   It took me years of living in China to realize that temples should
be seen on overnight visits--that they are still religious
sanctuaries, not museums and fun fairs. Jay Martin is a much quicker
study.</LD>
<TE>   In 1998, the Claremont McKenna College professor embarked on a
summer-long stay in southeastern China's temples, a bit of spiritual
tourism documented in "Journey to Heavenly Mountain." Unlike most
recent books about China, "Journey" is neither a travelogue nor
memoir of the country's rapid economic evolution, but of its
spiritual one. "I haven't come to look at [China], but to be a part
of it," he writes.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the people and places Martin encounters and describes so
precisely--from venerable masters on mist-shrouded mountains to
island-bound, angelic tour guides and devilish boatmen--are only part
of the tale. "Journey" is about Martin's own quest to expand his soul
by merging into the breaths of the multitudes around him--including
those who turn temples into tourist traps.</TE>
<TE>   At his first stop, at Lingyin, the Temple of Inspired Seclusion,
he is momentarily taken aback by what feels like Disneyland mixed
with Notre Dame. A travel writer would stop the account there. Yet
Martin is after more than a description, a simile and segue to the
next adventure.</TE>
<TE>   "I could easily be cynical about Lingyin," he admits. "But
actually being plunged into it without preparation and premeditation
makes me see that I myself, and all of us, are put together in the
same way--a bit of commerce here, some shallow pleasures there, old
memories, new desires, new landscapes along with ancient plantings,
and all fused with an authentic heart and a sacred soul--we are made
of such assemblages. I came to China to live in Buddhist monasteries
and revisit my soul. But I see here, right at the outset, that my
quest is much more complicated than I thought.... I realize that if I
am to find myself at all, it must be in the multitudes and varieties
that I possess, the shallow along with the deep, and my very human,
superficial desires along with my yearning for a bottomless
divinity."</TE>
<TE>   Martin ensconces himself in the life of a monk, taking residence
in temples for two months, rising at 3 in the morning to pray. "I am
content. Warm, drawn in, bowing and kneeling, following the group.
The chanting begins, I am a Buddhist now. Then it is over. But--of
course--not over, since it will resume tomorrow and never end until
the world does. And if the Buddhists are right, the world will never
end."</TE>
<TE>   The monks accept him as part of the community. That Martin is an
American matters none; some monks aver that he lived at the temple in
a past life and came back. Nor does it matter that the order's newest
monk is Catholic. A colleague reasons, "Catholics are on their way to
becoming Buddhists. You are just a little bit ahead of other
Catholics in the journey."</TE>
<TE>   Buddhism, an abbot explains, holds that to reach the Buddha inside
ourselves, we must enlarge our kind heart by cleansing ourselves of
desires. Martin asks what desire is most difficult to give up.</TE>
<TE>   "Beauty, the beauty of women," replies the 71-year-old monk.</TE>
<TE>   Another abbot confesses that his greatest desire is his computer,
which he uses to download the spiritual precepts called sutras.</TE>
<TE>   "The desire to possess the attractions of society," says another.
Others say it's the desire to understand quickly and the wish to rise
above people.</TE>
<TE>   For Martin, the question vexes him. How can he read a book, for
instance, without desiring to read?</TE>
<TE>   By the end of "Journey to Heavenly Mountain," Martin realizes that
his deepest desire is the same one which drives the reader to turn
the page: to find out more. Yet he has no intention of giving it up,
for he concludes that "desires are inseparably woven into the mottled
tapestry of life." And the soul was not what he thought it was, nor
is China some enormous refueling stop where one can top off the
spiritual tank merely by pulling in and opening one's wallet: "A talk
with a tree can bring as fine a vision as an expensive journey to
consult the wisest man in the farthest reaches of the universe."</TE>
<TE>   Like the earthworm with which he boasts conversing on a forest
walk, Martin burrows deeper and more expansively than the creature's
form suggests. The worm doesn't get to respond, but the dozens of
Chinese that the author meets do. It is these touching encounters
that teach him, and us, the most about the soul; and they make
"Journey to Heavenly Mountain" a rare, refreshing temple trip.</TE>

<LD>Graduation month is a fine time for educators to convey a few
last-minute civics lessons, reminding students, for instance, why the
principle that allowed Martin Luther King Jr. to deliver his "I Have
a Dream" speech also protects adolescent criticisms of stinky school
bathrooms. Too often, however, the end of the school year becomes
censoring season.</LD>
<LD>   This spring, Palmdale High students passed out a series of
self-described underground newspapers, in which they decried the
deplorable state of school restrooms. They also railed against the
over-representation of popular students in the school yearbook. For
good measure, they threw in profanities and unflattering references
to a security guard and the school's principal, Michael Vierra--who
promptly suspended the students.</LD>
<LD>   The first suspension apparently had to do with what Vierra saw as
the potentially libelous nature of the fliers--a dubious
interpretation of the insults, in our view. The second followed the
students' refusal to submit another, toned-down flier for approval.</LD>
<TE>   Anyone past the age of 17 understands that running a public school
is a herculean task. Parents, teachers and the majority of students
have lost patience with the unruly few who disrupt teaching and
learning--and with brats who use the 1st Amendment to justify verbal
tantrums.</TE>
<TE>   School officials have leeway to reasonably control disruptive
speech on campus--courts, for instance, have confirmed teachers'
authority to stop students from swearing in class and to censor
material that is untrue, harms someone's reputation and is not a
joke. Still, a principal has no more right than the president of the
United States to set aside the Constitution whenever it somehow
offends him or gets in the way.</TE>
<TE>   Under California's own "Leonard law," schools may not punish
students for expressions protected off campus under the 1st
Amendment. When they do, reversals are as predictable as a
commencement speech.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, Fallbrook High School suspended two students for
publishing their own underground paper, then, in an out-of-court
settlement, the district paid the students $22,000, erased the
suspensions from their records and publicly apologized. In 1997,
courts rebuked school authorities in La Puente by allowing a senior
to graduate after he passed out a series of fliers comparing his
principal to infamous dictators.</TE>
<TE>   The greatest risk of school administrators failing to understand
or respect free-speech rights is that the students who depend on them
may stumble into the adult world with a warped grasp of democracy.</TE>
<TE>   As evidence, consider that every year some university--this time
it's UC Davis--erupts in a brouhaha when one student or group of
students takes offense at something tasteless and sophomoric (maybe
even vile) that appeared in a campus publication and demand
punishment--in the UC Davis case, diversity training--for the
offenders.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps now's a good time for someone to remind the Davis students
and the Palmdale principal that the Constitution does not protect
against inconvenience or hurt feelings but does very clearly enshrine
the right to criticize.</TE>

<HD>Too Much Hunger by Half</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Children in California go hungry because state and county officials
can't make the food stamp program work right. California's program,
though improving, is the most error-plagued in the nation, according
to U.S. data released in April.</LD>
<LD>   In the past fiscal year, nearly one in five households got the
wrong amount in the colorful booklets containing $1, $5 and $10
coupons that can be used like cash to buy groceries. An estimated
124,520 households got more than the amount to which they were
entitled; 68,486 households got less. In addition, less than half of
those who qualify for food stamps receive them in California--though
1.7 million people get a monthly allotment, an additional 1.8 million
do not.</LD>
<LD>   Working people qualify when their monthly income is 130% or less
of the federal poverty guideline, or about $1,533 a month for a
family of three. Some don't want the government handout or they want
to avoid the hassle and so shun the program, which every month
provides recipients with an average of $78. Some families lose out
because the breadwinner can't get off work to fill out the reams of
paperwork in person. Many miss out because they don't know they are
eligible.</LD>
<TE>   Regardless of the reasons, when low-income adults don't get food
stamps, children too often don't get enough to eat--as was the case
for a brother and sister living with their widowed father just west
of downtown. Until their father got food stamps, they lived on the
federally subsidized breakfasts, lunches and snacks their public
school provided. They told Times staff writer Carla Rivera that if
there was nothing to eat at home after school they had to "wait for
tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   No child should have to wait for tomorrow to eat. California
issues $1.5 billion worth of food stamps a year through county-run
programs. That number should be $3 billion. That figure should
continue to grow because Congress has restored the benefit to legal
immigrants who have been in the U.S. at least five years. Washington
has lost patience and is about to levy a $115.8-million penalty for
California's mistakes, which would only take more food from the
mouths of hungry children.</TE>
<TE>   Fixing the problem will largely require fixing the Los Angeles
County program, which leads the nation with an error rate of 23%. The
county blames that failure on an overly complex and glitch-prone
computer. But bedtime stories about a big, bad, bug-ridden computer
don't make it any easier for children with growling stomachs to fall
asleep.</TE>

<LD>Art's good for people. A Valley girl stumbles upon "Shiva as the Lord
of the Dance" at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and something
about those arms waving gracefully within an aureole of flame
inspires her to see Ventura Boulevard in a whole new light. A janitor
from El Salvador stops by the Getty on his way to work, and that
night his usually bleak graveyard shift is invigorated by the
raucous, unsettling crowd in James Ensor's painting "Christ's Entry
Into Brussels."</LD>
<LD>   Recently, Times art critic Christopher Knight urged LACMA to
eliminate its general admission fee. We have an even bolder
suggestion: How about the area's top museums declare Greater Los
Angeles a free art zone?</LD>
<LD>   Many museums don't charge admission fees--including Washington's
publicly funded National Gallery, the St. Louis Art Museum, which
includes public and private funding, and the private Menil Collection
in Houston. But the Los Angeles region could be the first to fling
open its museums' doors to anyone with a hankering for some Rembrandt
or Diebenkorn.</LD>
<TE>   The Getty is already free. If the Museum of Contemporary Art, the
Huntington Library Art Collection and the Norton Simon Museum joined
the campaign, financially strapped aficionados might enjoy a few more
visits to their favorite Henry Moore sculpture or Diego Rivera
painting. More important, whole new segments of the population might
make room for art in their lives.</TE>
<TE>   Five months after Britain abolished entrance fees at its national
museums, attendance grew 75%--quite a revelation to those who argued
that people don't appreciate what comes free. Conversely, when LACMA
began charging in 1978, attendance to the museum dropped 44%. A
quarter-century later, annual attendance remains at 500,000.</TE>
<TE>   Admission fees represent 3% to 10% of a museum's annual operating
budget, so letting people in free would not threaten ruin. Waiving
entrance fees might turn some people away from buying museum
memberships, since many patrons are motivated, in part, by the free
admission that comes with member status. But the bulk of most
museums' budgets already comes from the donations of people who think
art is important and want to share a cherished experience.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, many of those people--even truly poor ones--who won't spend
the $6 for an adult admission to the Norton Simon wouldn't hesitate
to spend $2.50 more than that to see "Scooby-Doo" or 10 times that to
watch Shaq slam-dunk. Which only underscores museums' need to make
art more tempting. "Free admission" signs would do just that.</TE>

<LD>It is not my place to question whether the two Kaiser Permanente
executives, Dick Pettingill and Oliver Goldsmith, can speak for the
many doctors employed by the HMO. However, I do take exception to
their effort to include in their "we" all of the registered nurses
who deliver care to patients in the system's facilities (letter, June
15). The criticisms leveled at Kaiser by health-care activist Jamie
Court ("HMOs Stalk Patients' Rights," Commentary, June 10), far from
"exist[ing] only in his mind" (and those of lawyers), are shared by
many nurses and other health-care providers and certainly are in tune
with the many and frequent complaints from patients.</LD>
<LD>   The California Nurses Assn., which represents 10,000 Kaiser RNs,
shares many of the concerns voiced by Court and other critics. We
deplore Kaiser officials' attacks on the new Department of Managed
Health Care. We are also outraged by the revelation that Kaiser was
paying bonuses to Advice Line clerks to steer patients away from
appointments and referrals. The same goes for Kaiser continuing to
defend its compulsory arbitration system that undermines the
patient's ability to seek legal redress of grievances.</LD>
<TE>   The issue here is not an attempt by the DMHC "to regulate
physicians and how they operate their medical practices"; it is the
responsibility of one of the nation's largest HMOs to the patients it
covers and for accountability to the public. There is enough in
Kaiser's recent history to warrant continued vigilance.</TE>

<LD>Early Tuesday morning at 6th Street and Vermont Avenue, joyous, young
Korean Americans flew stunningly beautiful flags and blew car horns
to celebrate a soccer victory. A marvelous scene, but traffic was
moving slower than usual for that time of day. The LAPD was out in
force by the time I walked back after breakfast, and the celebration
had been squelched. After all, we can't allow spontaneous, exuberant,
law-abiding celebrators to make Koreatown employees late to work. On
June 14, commuters from as far away as Long Beach and Riverside were
late to work because of the Lakers victory parade--but that's
different.</LD>

<LD>Re "Cloning Receives a Makeover," June 17: "Words, words, words! They
shut one off from the universe. Three-quarters of the time one's
never in contact with things, only with the beastly words that stand
for them." What Aldous Huxley once lamented as an existential
poverty, human cloning entrepreneurs are now employing as the path to
prosperity. By deploying sterile and bewildering jargon (e.g.,
"somatic cell nuclear transfer," "nuclear-transfer-derived
blastocyst"), biotech capitalists have cordoned off the American
public from the ghastly physical reality of cloned human beings.</LD>
<LD>   The latest result of this Rube Goldberg rhetoric is the derailment
in the U.S. Senate of a clear-cut ban on human cloning. We have
allowed such "linguistic cloaking devices" to blunt our instinctive
aversion to the deliberate creation and destruction of living human
embryos. As we pursue utilitarian impulses rather than moral
conviction we unwittingly feed researchers' insatiable desire to push
ethical boundaries.</LD>
<TE>   In the case of human cloning, that means first cloning human
embryos for cell extraction or to use as disease models--"guinea
pigs." As time passes in the drive for elusive cures, new rhetoric
will rationalize growing the human embryo into a fetus--and
conceivably, even a born baby--for organ extraction. Once the
frontier of revulsion has been crossed, each successive foray into
the ethical wilderness will prove easier, until finally we find
ourselves irretrievably trapped in a brave new world of our own
creation.</TE>

<TE>   Therapeutic cloning is not making a new person out of an existing
person. Therapeutic cloning is making new cells for the existing sick
person. Why is that so hard to understand? It's not just for
45-year-old women like me with Parkinson's disease, it's for little
children suffering with juvenile diabetes. Are you going to explain
to a child that you are just not "comfortable" with a concept that
may cure his disease so he can live a long, healthy life? If you want
to look into that child's eyes or the eyes of adults suffering from a
progressively debilitating disease and try to tell them you can't see
past your own bizarre fears, you go ahead.</TE>

Ted Kennedy in their sponsorship of the Human Cloning Prohibition
Act. This bill makes sense.</TE>

<LD>Re "School's Day Has Passed," editorial, June 17: I see that The
Times has bought the latest reasons that the LAUSD has given for
closing the Bellagio Road Newcomer Center in Bel-Air: that the
students are better off at their home schools and the district will
save money otherwise spent on busing. Well, maybe you need to
reconsider, because their home schools have no room for them and will
still have to bus them out. Parents of Bellagio Road students have
received letters from Virgil Middle School, one of their home
schools, telling them that their children will be bused to schools on
the Westside or in the Valley. So much for the "home school" and
"saving money on busing" arguments.</LD>
<LD>   In the past year, the school district has given an ever-changing
series of reasons for closing Bellagio, and as fast as they have been
shot down, new reasons have been invented. As a result, a wonderful
program that many people, including some board of education members,
feel should be replicated throughout the district has been destroyed.
The real losers are the children.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe The Times can do some investigative reporting and discover
the truth behind the closing of Bellagio. You might start by looking
at board member Marlene Canter's cozy relationship with a charter
school that covets the Bellagio Road campus.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Special School for Immigrants to Close" (June 13) and your
June 17 editorial: New West Charter Middle School welcomes all
comers, not just Newcomers. The new charter school has been
requesting a shared-use, temporary site at Bellagio Road since
January. This request shared the use with the Newcomer program. When
the LAUSD decides what program will replace the Newcomer program, New
West will request to share with it.</TE>
<TE>   New West Charter Middle School was founded three years ago. Many
parents have dedicated hundreds of thousands of volunteer hours to
trying to create a model, ideal middle school--one that can represent
trends in educational reform that can be mirrored in other public
schools. The outreach recruitment has been tremendous-- more than 550
applicants (to a school that doesn't exist) from 115 different
schools and a very high level of diversity.</TE>

<LD>Perhaps I was just in a really good mood the day my friends and I

downtown. I found the museum and the area around it to be vibrant and
beautiful. The Walt Disney Concert Hall going up across the street
lent an air of excitement, and the imaginative skyscrapers of L.A.
shouted that they were not just any staid, ordinary buildings.</LD>
<LD>   The Warhol show was fascinating and extremely well done, although
why so many chose not to pay extra for the insightful audio tour
mystified us. The museum is airy, light and inviting, and the cafe
has superb food and service. I think those who say Los Angeles has
nothing to offer just haven't spent any time in town lately. As for
the Warhol exhibit, it is among the best I have ever visited, here in
the U.S. or abroad.</LD>

<LD>Marshall Drummond uses the recent "dirty" bomb threat to help make
the case for moving ahead with the high-level waste repository at
Yucca Mountain in his June 16 commentary. In doing so, he claims that
"Yucca Mountain has been built using billions of taxpayer dollars. It
has been tested and is ready to do its job."</LD>
<LD>   Yucca Mountain has not yet been built and cannot be built until
the Department of Energy submits a license application to the U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, perhaps in late 2004, which the NRC
must then approve within three years. Not until then can the NRC
grant an authorization to the DOE to build the repository. After it
is built, the NRC must approve the as-built repository and issue an
operating permit (2010 at the earliest). The DOE has been conducting
tests at Yucca Mountain using "exploratory studies tunnels" and also
uses computer models to predict how the repository will perform over
thousands of years. However, many scientific and technical issues and
uncertainties exist, according to the NRC licensing staff and reviews
by federal oversight bodies. Yucca Mountain may prove to be an
acceptable site for nuclear waste, but much work remains to assure it
is safe for the public.</LD>

<TE>   Drummond's commentary is absent the solution to the growing
nuclear waste problem here and abroad. The first step should be to
stop producing nuclear waste at commercial power plants and at
government defense installations. Our nation's nuclear power plants
are brimming over with spent fuel that ultimately will have to be
shipped to a permanent storage facility. Each 1,000-megawatt nuclear
power plant produces the equivalent of 1,000 Hiroshima-size bombs of
radioactivity annually. Multiply this by 105 or so operating
commercial reactors in the U.S. and the problem takes on new meaning.</TE>
<TE>   Our leaders have been telling us for years that 100% containment
is achievable, but the disaster of leaking waste at the Defense
Department's Richland, Wash., reactor complex--with more than a
million gallons of radioactive waste seeping toward the Columbia
River--gives little hope that a viable solution is at hand.</TE>
<TE>   Enough other storage facilities around the country are suffering
from their own containment problems, albeit on a less grand scale,
that the old line "everything is under control" is becoming very
shopworn. "Stop producing the waste and plug the leaks" is the best
solution to a problem that is already out of control. As for
Drummond, it is time to start drumming to a different beat that
includes safe, decentralized power sources that are benign to the
environment.</TE>

<TE>   Drummond wrote: "The half-life of some of this waste is 5,000
years--meaning it is dangerous for close to 10,000 years."
Balderdash! Whatever this waste is--Drummond does not identify it--it
would still be "dangerous" after 10,000 years, because 25% of the
original waste would still be radioactive. Supporters of the Yucca
Mountain project have been trying to convince us that radioactive
waste can be safely stored in the mountain for 10,000 years and
beyond. Is Drummond attempting to say that at the 10,000-year mark
all dangerous radioactivity will simply vanish in Yucca Mountain?</TE>
<TE>   Let me identify an actual waste product from nuclear power plants:
plutonium-239. This isotope was employed in the Nagasaki bomb in
1945, is used in nuclear weapons and is routinely produced in every
nuclear power plant in the world. If the Yucca Mountain project is
approved, Pu-239 will be stored there. Its half-life is roughly
24,100 years. How many years of storage are required before the
remaining Pu-239 comprises less than 1% of the original Pu-239? More
than 160,000 years!</TE>

<LD>It looks as if President Bush and the rest of the people running this
country have decided to take a more proactive approach as a result of
9/11 and realize the importance of eliminating Saddam Hussein as he
continues to prepare weapons of mass destruction. Bush has declared
Iraq part of an "axis of evil." Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and
Colin Powell had a chance before, with George H.W. Bush, and came to
the same conclusion, but public opinion was against them.</LD>
<LD>   Now, taking it one step further, we are borrowing the plot from
Steven Spielberg's new movie, "Minority Report." Our government is
stopping the crime before it is committed by rounding up suspects
without charging them, throwing our Constitution out the window. The
implications of this practice are hard to imagine--just as is the
continuing existence of Hussein, who must be "removed" for the good
of world peace. In the process of capturing him, if we have to kill
him in self-defense, as Bush has evidently approved of, so be it.
Assassination or "self-defense," it's all semantics. It's obvious
that something has to be done. This is no Hollywood movie, and there
are no easy endings.</LD>

Going it alone in war against Iraq and other nations must come at
great sacrifice of the American people. Without the combined military
resources of our allies it would be folly to attempt war with our
present armed forces. The magnitude and duration of such a war are
unknown. Who else would jump on us while we were preoccupied in that
conflict?</TE>
<TE>   Going it alone means a military draft. Planning must be for the
worst possible military situation and conscription without deferments

<HD>Women Win With Title IX</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "The War on Football," Opinion, June 16: Jessica Gavora's article
claiming that Title IX has unfairly resulted in cuts in male sports
teams is legally inaccurate and based on gender stereotypes. First,
Title IX does not require schools to reduce male teams. Rather, one
of three ways a school can demonstrate Title IX compliance is to show
that the percentage of female athletes is proportionate to the
percentage of female students generally. Women are entitled to a fair
share of the sports budget "pie," not just what is left over once
male teams take their cut.</LD>
<LD>   In large part, Gavora's argument is based on the unsupportable
claim that football should be distinguished because it is
revenue-generating. However, 58% of Division I-A and I-AA football
programs do not make enough revenue to cover their own costs, let
alone enough to subsidize other sports. Second, Gavora alleges
incorrectly that women are less willing to play college sports and
ignores the fact that women's athletic interests and abilities do not
develop in a vacuum.</LD>
<LD>   Title IX has made strides toward creating an environment in which
girls and women have been allowed not simply to step up to the plate
but to win the game.</LD>

<TE>   The Department of Education is responsible for ensuring an
equitable education for our young people. As Gavora states, Title IX,
which calls for funding equity, including sports, has raised the
level of participation of women in 30 years from interlopers to just
under 40% of high school and college athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Football, the behemoth of sports, not only costs more per player
but uses more players, thus all component costs are
disproportionately much higher. Bigger is not better, especially in
education. College football has become the farm club for the NFL. We
need to recognize it has no place in higher learning, especially if
its reason for existence is to produce income. Let's reclassify it
into the fund-raising arm of colleges and universities. If it makes
money, it lives. Loses money, it dies. The accountants can make the
decisions.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't take a degree to see that the game of football crowds
out productive growth, even if it is great to watch. I love the Super
Bowl.</TE>

<TE>   Gavora outlined all the problems caused by Title IX with respect
to the fairness of resources allocated to women's and men's sports,
with the conclusion that football was somehow being shortchanged. I'd
like to point out another aspect to the football problem, and that is
how football often commands much greater resources than many other
equally deserving school activities at the high school level.</TE>
<TE>   When our son was in high school, he was a dedicated member of the
high school band and immensely enjoyed competitions with other high
school bands; however, his enthusiasm was not shared by the principal
or other members of the school's administration. While this high
school never had a winning football team, it had a strong band
program that won many competitions and awards. The football team was
so bad that the only spectators at most games were the parents of the
team members and "band boosters" like my wife and me, who came out to
carry the kids' equipment and serve them water after their halftime
performances. The football team got all the usual perks, including
several coaches and free uniforms. The band got a band director and
transportation to events. Other expenses, such as new uniforms
(infrequently purchased), marching coaches, choreographers and
equipment replacements, had to be paid for through fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   During the years our son was in band we purchased several
instruments that were donated to the band and bought all new cases
for the band's drums. It was only through donations like ours and
considerable fund-raising efforts that the band was able to survive.
The attitude of our school administrators indicated a clear bias in
favor of football.</TE>
<TE>   I would like to see a more balanced approach, particularly in high
school. At that level, there should not be a main sport that hogs all
the resources and publicity. Also, special efforts should be made to
ensure that not just football players receive recognition as being
important students.</TE>
<TE>   The kid who has mastered an instrument in band or displays great
talent in some other area should receive as much recognition from the
school's administration as the quarterback.</TE>

related to Title IX, that Division I college football is played

professionals normally play.</TE>

<LD>Re "No Panacea, but a Start," editorial, June 17: The simplistic
approach reflected in the prescription-drug bills mentioned, and by
most medical insurance programs, is that those who refuse to take
generic drugs do so deliberately and therefore should be made to bear
a cost many times greater.</LD>
<LD>   My wife's experience, and that of many others, should be given
consideration. She is required to take many medications to control a
variety of afflictions, and her body is sufficiently sensitive that
on occasion it rejects the different chemical base that is often used
by pharmaceutical companies that offer generics. In one instance she
almost died because of such an immune-system reaction to a very
common drug.</LD>
<LD>   I would suggest that punishing those who have such sensitivities
is itself insensitive to their very real needs. What then can be done
to control the greater costs of nongenerics? Perhaps requiring
rejection of a generic to be based on a physician's approval, but
covering the additional cost under such circumstances.</LD>
<TE>   That isn't a perfect solution, but it's better than what is
proposed in these bills and seems to be common practice in the
medical marketplace.</TE>

<TE>   In a June 17 front-page article on the relaxation of sexual
repression in Egypt, you report the likely lifting of the ban on
Viagra in that country. Mention is made that it is anticipated this
move will halve the current black market price of the drug, $10 a
tablet. The current retail price of this medication in the U.S. is
about $10 for a 100-milligram pill. Viagra is not the only widely
advertised medication sold at a significant premium in this country
when compared with the price in other countries.</TE>
<TE>   When considering the ever-growing cost of medication in our
country, our legislators should look to the role of far-reaching
advertising in driving up our pharmaceutical bills. Unfortunately,
the subsidy many of our representatives seek to preserve is the one
they receive from the industry's lobbyists.</TE>

stimulating discussion of difficult subjects...."</TE>
<TE>   What makes it revolting is the slant of the article: the
performance worries of Egyptian men on their wedding nights, with the
throwaway description of "genital excision," also known here as
"female circumcision." Well, it's also known as genital mutilation,
but The Times fails to mention that, or exactly what this barbaric
procedure is all about.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, your story offers the single sentence, a quote from one
physician in his 20s, who says that "excision, while catastrophic for
women, puts added pressure on already performance-conscious men."</TE>

<HD>Amtrak Losses Could Derail State Service</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's network of passenger trains--including the Los Angeles
area's Metrolink service and trains running to San Diego and San
Francisco--could come to a grinding halt if Amtrak doesn't receive a
loan from Congress next week to help cover its massive debt, state
officials say.</LD>
<LD>   The threatened stoppage is a byproduct of a tense dispute in
Washington over the fate of Amtrak, the fiscally hemorrhaging
operation reliant on federal support.</LD>
<LD>   In a Thursday speech, Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta
provided the Bush administration's blueprint for Amtrak: an agency
shorn of federal subsidies, open to privatization and reliant on the
kind of state investment that has made California a national rail
leader.</LD>
<TE>   But Amtrak's new president, David Gunn, upstaged Mineta. He told a
Senate panel that Amtrak's financial picture is much worse than
previously thought, that it needs at least an immediate $200-million
boost to make it through the summer, and that if he does not get the
money he'll begin shutting down the system.</TE>
<TE>   "We are at the point of no return," Gunn said.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak spokesman Vernae Graham said California may end up halting
its train service by July 1.</TE>
<TE>   "A shutdown is certainly on the table," added Jeff Morales,
director of the California Department of Transportation, which
oversees the state's transit systems. "Everyone is scrambling to
figure out what's going on, what the options are. It's not a
comfortable time."</TE>
<TE>   California is a hub of Amtrak activity. Four long-distance Amtrak
trains, such as the Coast Starlight connecting Los Angeles to
Seattle, run through the state. Three intercity routes--San Diego to
San Luis Obispo, San Jose to Sacramento, and Oakland to
Bakersfield--are among the most used Amtrak trains in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, Amtrak managers, dispatchers and operators staff
three of the state's commuter systems--the Bay Area's Caltrain, San
Diego County's Coaster, and Metrolink, which provides about 34,000
rides each weekday on a five-county rail network that feeds into Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   All of these trains could sit idle if Gunn follows through on his
threat.</TE>
<TE>   In downtown Los Angeles, that prospect sobered riders waiting for
trains at Union Station. Such a move, said Bruce Noldon, a Beverly
Hills commodity broker who travels Amtrak to San Diego once a week,
would "force people back onto the roads."</TE>
<TE>   "The trains are pretty much packed," he said, expressing his
displeasure. "I've never been on a train that's empty.... You can't
tell by the service that they're having financial problems."</TE>
<TE>   At Metrolink's downtown headquarters, Chief Executive David Solow
spent Friday planning how his agency will respond if Amtrak pulls the
plug.</TE>
<TE>   Solow said that at worst Metrolink will come to a complete halt
for "a month or two."</TE>
<TE>   Then the agency would be faced with two options. Metrolink could
either rework the contracts of the 145 key Amtrak workers, a delicate
task that would require union and federal approval of a contract that
totals about $18 million annually. Or it could hire new staff, a
difficult prospect, Solow said, since train operators would have to
learn Metrolink's 416-mile rail network and then pass rail safety
exams.</TE>
<TE>   "We're obviously hoping Amtrak will get the money they need," said
Solow. "But if not, we have to be ready.... Shutting things down is
going to aggravate the traffic environment. There certainly would be
a lot more cars on freeways."</TE>
<TE>   The shutdown threat comes as new figures show that Amtrak's fiscal
health is even worse than previously thought.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with mounting debt, former Amtrak chief George Warrington
contemplated putting an end to long-haul routes considered the
agency's biggest money losers, a spokesman said. But when Gunn began
looking at his budget after assuming Amtrak leadership early this
year, he quickly saw that more wholesale moves might be required.</TE>
<TE>   Gunn told the Senate committee Thursday that in the 2001 fiscal
year Amtrak lost $1.19 billion instead of the $900 million previously
reported.</TE>
<TE>   The $200 million Gunn is requesting now would help the agency meet
its budget targets for the short term, but would do nothing to fix a
system that has been underfunded and financially shaky since its 1971
inception, when the federal government created the quasi-governmental
agency to take the place of private passenger rail lines.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak's political support is now less certain than ever, with a
near-even number of proponents and critics in Washington. Some say
the system, largely regarded as underfunded and overburdened by a
mandate to pay its own way, should simply be the recipient of a
massive infusion of federal money.</TE>
<TE>   Others, such as a reform body set up by President Clinton when his
administration kept Amtrak afloat with a $2.2-billion grant in 1997,
argue that privatization should be introduced, management should be
restructured and states should start footing a greater chunk of the
bill.</TE>
<TE>   On that final point, California is far ahead of other states,
boosting the in-state Amtrak lines by spending at least $2.4 billion
since the 1970s on the three routes.</TE>
<TE>   That state money, some of it augmented by local governments,
bankrolls infrastructure: new trains and tracks, improved signals and
stations.</TE>
<TE>   The infusion has allowed Amtrak to concentrate on operations and
has paved the way for Amtrak in California to achieve a modicum of
success.</TE>
<TE>   With its new trains, the Pacific Surfliner, connecting San Diego
and Santa Barbara through downtown Los Angeles, carries a little more
than 1 million riders a year, making it the second busiest Amtrak
train line in the nation. The rail system serving the Northeast is
the busiest and most financially healthy.</TE>
<TE>   Morales said that if Amtrak fails, California may be forced to
consider breaking away and running its own service, contracting out
with private companies that would run the trains. Such a move would
be made difficult by laws protecting Amtrak workers and would be
contingent on federal legislation to allow companies other than
Amtrak to run trains on the nation's rail system.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just hoping this gets sorted out before anything drastic
has to be considered," said Morales. "Right now we are at the mercy
of Washington."</TE>

<HD>San Bernardino County Fire Is Ruled Arson</HD>
<DH>Safety: Investigators find several ignition points,
including one on Interstate 15, for flames that charred nearly 7,000
acres and forced dozens of residents to evacuate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A San Bernardino County fire that roared across Interstate 15 this
week was deliberately set by one or more arsonists, investigators
said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "There were multiple points of ignition," said U.S. Forest Service
fire information officer Ruth Wenstrom.</LD>
<LD>   "One of the locations was in the center divider of the freeway,"
said another forest service officer, Melody Lardner.</LD>
<TE>   The fire, which has charred 6,758 acres and cost nearly $2.6
million to suppress, was expected to be contained by Friday evening.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday and Tuesday, dozens of residents were evacuated from the
unincorporated areas of Oak Hills and Summit Valley, but no homes
were burned.</TE>
<TE>   The spot on the freeway where investigators believe the fire was
set is about three miles south of California 138 near the Cajon Pass.
Another ignition point was a private landholding in the San
Bernardino National Forest called Cosy Dell, Lardner said.</TE>
<TE>   Fire officials appealed to motorists and anyone else who might
have witnessed the blaze in the early stages to notify them.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't need to hear from everyone who came up over the pass and
said, 'Wow, look at those flames,' " Wenstrom said.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're looking for is people who may have driven through when
the fire was, say, as small as their living room.... Maybe what they
might have noticed is people in the area, vehicles in the area,
activities going on."</TE>
<TE>   Interstate 15 and California 138 were closed after the fire broke
out about 2:30 p.m. Sunday. Thousands of drivers were forced to make
their way along winding backcountry mountain roads, to detour for
miles or just sit and fume.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the people ended up parked and angry," Lardner said.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze, dubbed the Blue Cut fire, was named for a distinctive
bluish gray rock cut in a nearby hillside. Fire investigators
discovered several ignition points by retracing burn patterns and
examining which way grasses bent and how trees and brush were
charred, Wenstrom said.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,000 firefighters and support personnel from around the
state battled the blaze. Some of the brush had not burned for 40
years.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, a single-engine plane leased by the Forest Service
crashed in a Big Bear residential neighborhood about 7:30 p.m. as it
returned from the fire. The pilot was the only one aboard, and was
not injured.</TE>
<TE>   Two houses in the area of the crash sustained some damage to
fencing and landscaping. The crash is being investigated by federal
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Three firefighters were hospitalized overnight earlier in the week
after the fire passed over a truck they were sitting in.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, weary firefighters were waiting to be released, aware
that they are facing months of particularly dry conditions that could
feed more fires.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing the public can do is be particularly observant,"
Wenstrom said. "Pay attention, write down things like vehicle
descriptions, or license plate numbers, or descriptions of
activities. And take the time to phone it in. it may be just the tip
we need."</TE>

<HD>Political Profit in a Cause</HD>
<DH>Law: On behalf of charities, officeholders legally solicit
from those doing business with the state, which creates ethics issues
on two sides.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO and JON ORTIZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>California politicians are raising tens of thousands of dollars on
behalf of their favorite charities from special interests with
business before the state.</LD>
<LD>   Although the practice is legal, some government watchdogs say it
gives donors another way to influence the political process, and it
allows officeholders to burnish their image outside the normal
scrutiny applied to campaign finances.</LD>
<LD>   Since 1997, California legislators and statewide officeholders
including the governor have been permitted by state law to seek
donations for charities, school booster groups and other nonprofit
organizations, without having those donations count as gifts or
campaign contributions to them.</LD>
<TE>   In some cases, the donations exceed what the politicians would
have been able to collect for their own campaigns under state and
federal laws, or have come from tobacco companies and other groups
from whom they had publicly pledged not to take money.</TE>
<TE>   In the last two years, California Treasurer Phil Angelides has
raised more than $100,000 in charitable donations from New York
investment banks and underwriting firms working on the state's
$11.1-billion bond to finance electricity bought during the energy
crisis, state records show. The donations went to benefit the Michael
Dukakis internship at UCLA and the drama club at Sacramento's Luther
Burbank High School, among other causes.</TE>
<TE>   "They love the theater; we know that," joked Robert Stern of the
Center for Governmental Studies, a Los Angeles group that tracks the
flow of political money, referring to the Wall Street bankers. "They
are not doing this for altruistic purposes."</TE>
<TE>   Federal "pay-to-play" laws prohibit the underwriters working on
the lucrative bond deal from giving Angelides, a Sacramento native
and former Dukakis fund-raiser, more than $250 in campaign cash if
they want to do business with the state. But the laws do not cover
charitable contributions made at his behest.</TE>
<TE>   Angelides declined to discuss the donations but issued a written
statement defending them.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the last 25 years, my family and I have proudly contributed
to and raised funds for charitable causes," the statement said, "and
we will happily continue to do so."</TE>
<TE>   A number of politicians contacted about the practice made similar
statements, noting the benevolence of the charities and causes that
benefited from their actions. However, some of the solicitations
clearly benefited the politicians as well.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, for example, Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante solicited $150,000
from the Los Angeles Galaxy professional soccer team to cover
Spanish-language advertising for a goodwill soccer match at the Rose
Bowl between the Galaxy and Guadalajara's Chivas Rayadas club.</TE>
<TE>   He and Alberto Cardenas Jimenez, governor of Jalisco, presided
over the event, billed as a way to promote friendship and trade among
neighboring states, and the winner, Los Angeles, received ... the
Cruz M. Bustamante Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "This was an appropriate and legal event," said Bustamante
spokeswoman Deborah Pacyna. "It was more of an international trade
and goodwill event than a personal political event. If it was the
Irish Cup, I could see how it would be a political advantage, but
these are his people."</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Carl Washington (D-Paramount) raised money from Park
Water Co. of Downey to help finance his Operation Gobble, a campaign
to distribute 1,000 turkeys to constituents in his Los Angeles County
district before Thanksgiving. The donations he solicited went to a
variety of local groups that took part in his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "It's totally innocent," said Washington spokesman Angelo
Williams. "It's turkeys for the homeless."</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Tom Calderon, an unsuccessful candidate for state
insurance commissioner this spring, raised $25,000 from Allstate last
winter for the Southwest Voter Registration and Education Project, a
Latino advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   Calderon (D-Montebello) also solicited more than $100,000 from
companies, including Kaiser Permanente and Albertson's Inc., for the
Public Health Assn., 58th A.D., a group that held a diabetes
awareness event he attended, featuring raffles, food and mariachis.</TE>
<TE>   Calderon could not be reached for comment. A spokeswoman said he
solicited the money for the diabetes event after learning that there
were high rates of it in his district, and that he sought money for
the Southwest Voter Registration and Education Project because he
strongly believes in increasing Latino voter participation.</TE>
<TE>   In all, legislators and statewide elected officials have collected
more than $5 million on behalf of charities and nonprofits since the
law, passed by the Legislature in 1997, went into effect.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign finance watchdogs say they are pleased that politicians
have to publicly report raising the money. But some say they believe
the threshold for disclosure--$5,000 from a single source in a
calendar year--is too steep, while others say policing of the
little-known rule by the state's Fair Political Practices Commission
appears to be lax at best.</TE>
<TE>   "It is important for these types of payments to be disclosed,"
said Jim Knox, executive director of California Common Cause. "My
experience, however, leads me to believe that the disclosure has been
rather spotty, and enforcement has not been happening.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there is an undeniable political benefit" to many of the
solicitations, he added. "It's a gray area. Oftentimes, legislators
can be appropriately involved in raising funds for charities. The
danger is when it crosses the line and the donors are attempting to
curry favor."</TE>
<TE>   The FPPC, the state's official political watchdog agency, has
never taken formal action against a politician for violating that
law, a spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   California legislators created the reporting requirement out of
concerns that the donations they sought on behalf of nonprofits would
count as gifts or campaign contributions to themselves.</TE>
<TE>   State voters in 1990 had approved strict limits on the gifts
politicians could accept from special interests.</TE>
<TE>   Because of that and other changes in campaign laws, the FPPC
notified a top Senate official that it would review charity
solicitations case by case to determine whether they had political
overtones and thus needed to be listed on campaign filings.</TE>
<TE>   The result was a flood of letters to the agency asking for
preliminary approval of charity pitches--and state legislation to
ensure that the solicitations were not listed on the political
finance forms, which receive wide public scrutiny. Sen. Richard
Polanco (D-Los Angeles) carried the original legislation. It failed,
despite support from Common Cause, but an identical bill by Sen.
Betty Karnette (D-Long Beach) passed in 1997 and took effect that
same year.</TE>
<TE>   "One gets the feeling that at that point, the issue was swept
under the rug," Knox said. "Once [lawmakers] were freed from the
danger these contributions were to them," and the solicitations were
declared legal, the issue faded from public view.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike campaign finance statements, the information on charitable
donations is not available over the Internet, and until recently most
news reporters and campaign finance experts were apparently unaware
it even existed. The information is available in Sacramento and
provides the public with insight into the financing of some events
they might not otherwise have learned about.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis, for example, disclosed more than $1.5 million in
donations that his inaugural committee, a nonprofit, received from
special interest groups ranging from the California Teachers Assn. to
the Cabazon Band of Mission Indians.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and some prior governors had voluntarily made that
information public after inquiries from the press about the funding
of the lavish galas, but others had not, said Stern of the Center for
Governmental Studies.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, who pledged not to accept any more money
from tobacco companies during his successful 1998 campaign for the
state's top law enforcement post, did solicit a $20,000 donation from
Philip Morris through his inaugural committee, records show.</TE>
<TE>   The money was used to buy food for needy families in the Pasadena
area and to recognize Haven House Inc., a shelter for battered women.</TE>
<TE>   "He wasn't taking contributions," said Lockyer spokesman Nathan
Barankin, noting that his boss has not, in fact, accepted any
campaign contributions from tobacco companies. The Philip Morris
money, he said, "serves a potential public policy purpose, to give
funds to a shelter."</TE>

<LD>An elderly woman with Alzheimer's Disease was rescued from her
burning home Friday evening by her neighbor and a caretaker,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Maxine Collins, 82, had only minor injuries after her rescuers saw
her standing in her front window banging on the glass as the home was
consumed by flames. Her neighbor, Irv Peters, 50, and the caretaker
broke the window and dragged Collins to safety, witnesses said. Her
cat, however, has yet to be found, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Moments later, firefighters arrived at the home in the 13000 block
of North Myers Street in Burbank. The fire caused nearly $500,000
damage to the home and its contents, officials said.</LD>

<LD>An adult bookstore in Mission Hills must post two uniformed guards

<LD>   Talk of the Valley, in the 15400 block of Devonshire Street, also

<HD>Senator Threatens Budget Gambit</HD>
<DH>Politics: Steve Peace wants floor vote without Assembly
compromise. Upper-house Democrats seek tax hike for wealthy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>With negotiations over a new state budget at a standstill, a key
lawmaker said Friday that he'll ask the Senate to vote on its own
version of the spending plan regardless of whether a compromise plan
with the Assembly is complete.</LD>
<LD>   Senate Budget Committee Chairman Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) also
said the Senate proposal may abandon Gov. Gray Davis' plan to raise
the vehicle license fee, instead adopting a proposal by Senate leader
John Burton (D-San Francisco) to raise income taxes on the wealthiest
Californians.</LD>
<LD>   Peace described the Burton plan as the "option of choice" among
Democrats but emphasized a final decision on switching the taxes has
yet to be made. The Senate could vote on a spending plan, or at least
parts of it, as early as Tuesday, Peace said. "We're going to put a
budget on the floor next week with or without the Assembly," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Peace adjourned a legislative committee negotiating a compromise
budget on Thursday after Assembly Republicans thwarted a plan by
Davis to shift $1.7 billion in education funding to help get the
state out of the red. Republicans opposed the shift after Democratic
leaders refused a GOP request to earmark, beginning in July 2003,
about $1 billion to equalize funding among rural and urban schools
and help school districts pay certain retirement benefit
requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Peace took issue with what he described as the Republicans'
failure to raise equalization funding with the committee, which has
been meeting for three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "If they're not going to raise the issue in the conference
committee, what's the point of meeting?" Peace said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Peace said he will not call a meeting of the full committee Sunday
as he had planned unless there is an indication the matter in the
Assembly will be resolved.</TE>
<TE>   Removing the budget from the Senate-Assembly conference committee
and taking it up on the Senate floor would allow upper-house
lawmakers to insert the Burton plan to raise the highest individual
tax brackets to 10% and 11% from 9.3%. Estimates of how much the plan
would raise range from $2.5 billion to $3.2 billion a year.</TE>
<TE>   Davis prefers to raise $1.3 billion in the next fiscal year by
essentially doubling the vehicle license fees paid by motorists.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks said that
Republicans have pushed for better equalization in school funding for
years and that the $1.7-billion funding shift proposed by Davis
creates unallocated money that his caucus wants earmarked for
equalization. He also said because the change would not take place
until the following budget year he does not believe it's a matter the
conference committee needs to take up.</TE>

<HD>A Closer Look at What Bishops Hath Wrought</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last week, the nation's Roman Catholic bishops overwhelmingly
approved their first national policy to oust all priests from public
ministry who molest minors.</LD>
<LD>   In cases where a priest is not defrocked for abuse, he will be
subject to harsh restrictions that will virtually ban him from
face-to-face contact with parishioners. He will not be permitted to
wear clerical garb, celebrate Mass or publicly present himself as a
priest.</LD>
<LD>   Here is an excerpted version of the Charter for the Protection of
Children and Young People, approved June 14 on a 239-13 vote of the
nation's bishops:</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Preamble</TE>
<TE>   The church in the United States is experiencing a crisis without
precedent in our times. The sexual abuse of children and young people
by some priests and bishops, and the ways in which we bishops
addressed these crimes and sins, have caused enormous pain, anger and
confusion. Innocent victims and their families have suffered
terribly.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, secrecy has created an atmosphere that has inhibited
the healing process and, in some cases, enabled sexually abusive
behavior to be repeated. As bishops, we acknowledge our mistakes and
our role in that suffering, and we apologize and take responsibility
for too often failing victims and our people in the past.</TE>
<TE>   We also take responsibility for dealing with this problem
strongly, consistently and effectively in the future. From the depths
of our hearts, we bishops express great sorrow and profound regret
for what the Catholic people are enduring.</TE>
<TE>   To Promote Healing and Reconciliation With Victims/Survivors of
Sexual Abuse of Minors</TE>
<TE>   ARTICLE 1:</TE>
<TE>   Dioceses will reach out to victims/survivors and their families
and demonstrate a sincere commitment to their spiritual and emotional
well-being. The first obligation of the church with regard to the
victims is for healing and reconciliation. Where such outreach is not
already in place and operative, each diocese is to develop an
outreach to every person who has been the victim of sexual abuse as a
minor by anyone acting in the name of the church, whether the abuse
was recent or occurred many years in the past.</TE>
<TE>   ARTICLE 2:</TE>
<TE>   Dioceses will have mechanisms in place to respond promptly to any
allegation where there is reason to believe that sexual abuse of a
minor has occurred. Dioceses will have a competent assistance
coordinator to aid in the immediate pastoral care of persons who
claim to have been sexually abused as minors by clergy or other
church personnel.</TE>
<TE>   Dioceses will also have a review board, the majority of whose
members will be laypersons not in the employ of the diocese. This
board will assist the diocesan bishop in assessing allegations and
fitness for ministry, and will regularly review diocesan policies and
procedures for dealing with sexual abuse of minors.</TE>
<TE>   ARTICLE 3:</TE>
<TE>   Dioceses will not enter into confidentiality agreements except for
grave and substantial reasons brought forward by the victim/survivor
and noted in the text of the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   To Guarantee an Effective Response to Allegations of Sexual Abuse
of Minors</TE>
<TE>   ARTICLE 4:</TE>
<TE>   Dioceses will report an allegation of sexual abuse of a person who
is a minor to the public authorities. They will cooperate in their
investigation in accord with the law of the jurisdiction in question.</TE>
<TE>   Dioceses will cooperate with public authorities about reporting in
cases when the person is no longer a minor. In every instance,
dioceses will advise victims of their right to make a report to
public authorities and will support this right.</TE>
<TE>   ARTICLE 5:</TE>
<TE>   We repeat the words of our Holy Father in his "Address to the
Cardinals of the United States and Conference Officers": "There is no
place in the priesthood or religious life for those who would harm
the young." When the preliminary investigation of a complaint against
a priest or deacon so indicates, the diocesan bishop will relieve the
alleged offender promptly of his ministerial duties.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged offender will be referred for appropriate medical and
psychological evaluation, so long as this does not interfere with the
investigation by civil authorities. When the accusation has proved to
be unfounded, every step possible will be taken to restore the good
name of the priest or deacon.</TE>
<TE>   Where sexual abuse by a priest or a deacon is admitted or is
established after an appropriate investigation in accord with canon
law, the following will pertain:</TE>
<TE>   * Diocesan policy will provide that for even a single act of
sexual abuse of a minor--past, present or future--the offending
priest or deacon will be permanently removed from ministry. In
keeping with the stated purpose of this charter, an offending priest
or deacon will be offered professional assistance for his own healing
and well-being as well as for the purpose of prevention.</TE>
<TE>   * In every case, the processes provided for in canon law must be
observed, and the various provisions of canon law must be considered.
These provisions may include a request by the priest or deacon for
dispensation from the obligation of holy orders and the loss of the
clerical state, or a request by the bishop for dismissal from the
clerical state even without the consent of the priest or deacon.</TE>
<TE>   * If the penalty of dismissal from the clerical state has not been
applied (e.g., for reasons of advanced age or infirmity), the
offender is to lead a life of prayer and penance. He will not be
permitted to celebrate Mass publicly, to wear clerical garb, or to
present himself publicly as a priest.</TE>
<TE>   ARTICLE 6:</TE>
<TE>   While the priestly commitment to the virtue of chastity and the
gift of celibacy is well known, there will be clear and
well-publicized diocesan standards of ministerial behavior and
appropriate boundaries for clergy and for any other church personnel
in positions of trust who have regular contact with children and
young people.</TE>
<TE>   ARTICLE 7:</TE>
<TE>   Each diocese will develop a communications policy that reflects a
commitment to transparency and openness. Within the confines of
respect for the privacy and the reputation of the individuals
involved, dioceses will deal as openly as possible with members of
the community. This is especially so with regard to assisting and
supporting parish communities directly affected by ministerial
misconduct involving minors.</TE>
<TE>   To Ensure the Accountability of Our Procedures</TE>
<TE>   ARTICLE 8:</TE>
<TE>   To assist in the consistent application of these principles and to
provide a vehicle of accountability and assistance to dioceses in
this matter, we authorize the establishment of an Office for Child
and Youth Protection at our national headquarters. The tasks of this
office will include:</TE>
<TE>   * Assisting individual dioceses in the implementation of "safe
environment" programs.</TE>
<TE>   * Assisting provinces and regions in the development of
appropriate mechanisms to audit adherence to policies.</TE>
<TE>   * Producing an annual public report on the progress made in
implementing the standards in this charter.</TE>
<TE>   This report shall include the names of those dioceses which, in
the judgment of this office, are not in compliance with the
provisions and expectations of this charter. This office will have
staffing sufficient to fulfill its basic purpose. Staff will consist
of persons who are expert in the protection of minors; they will be
appointed by the general secretary of the [bishops] conference.</TE>
<TE>   ARTICLE 9:</TE>
<TE>   The work of the Office for Child and Youth Protection will be
assisted and monitored by a review board--including
parents--appointed by the conference president and reporting directly
to him.</TE>
<TE>   The board will also commission a descriptive study, with the full
cooperation of our dioceses, of the nature and scope of the problem
within the Catholic Church in the United States, including such data
as statistics on perpetrators and victims.</TE>
<TE>   ARTICLE 10:</TE>
<TE>   The membership of the Ad Hoc Committee on Sexual Abuse will be
reconstituted to include representation from all the episcopal
regions of the country.</TE>
<TE>   ARTICLE 11:</TE>
<TE>   The president of the conference will inform the Holy See of this
charter to indicate the manner in which we, the Catholic bishops,
together with the entire church in the United States, intend to
address this present crisis.</TE>
<TE>   To Protect the Faithful in the Future</TE>
<TE>   ARTICLE 12:</TE>
<TE>   Dioceses will establish "safe environment" programs. They will
cooperate with parents, civil authorities, educators and community
organizations to provide education and training for children, youth,
parents, ministers, educators, and others about ways to make and
maintain a safe environment for children.</TE>
<TE>   ARTICLE 13:</TE>
<TE>   Dioceses will evaluate the background of all diocesan and parish
personnel who have regular contact with minors. Specifically, they
will utilize the resources of law enforcement and other community
agencies.</TE>
<TE>   ARTICLE 14:</TE>
<TE>   When a cleric is proposed for a new assignment, transfer,
residence in another diocese or diocese in a country other than the
United States, or residence in the local community of a religious
institute, the sending bishop or major superior will forward and the
receiving bishop or major superior will review--before assignment--an
accurate and complete description of the cleric's record, including
whether there is anything in his background or service that would
raise questions about his fitness for ministry.</TE>
<TE>   ARTICLE 15:</TE>
<TE>   The Ad Hoc Committee on Sexual Abuse and the officers of the
Conference of Major Superiors of Men will meet to determine how this
charter will be conveyed and established in the communities of
religious men in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   ARTICLE 16:</TE>
<TE>   Given the extent of the problem of the sexual abuse of minors in
our society, we are willing to cooperate with other churches and
ecclesial communities, other religious bodies, institutions of
learning, and other interested organizations in conducting research
in this area.</TE>
<TE>   ARTICLE 17:</TE>
<TE>   We pledge our complete cooperation with the apostolic visitation
of our diocesan seminaries and religious houses of formation ...
these new visits will focus on the question of human formation for
celibate chastity.... We look forward to this opportunity to
strengthen our priestly formation programs so that they may provide
God's people with mature and holy priests.</TE>
<TE>   Conclusion</TE>
<TE>   We pledge most solemnly to one another and to you, God's people,
that we will work to our utmost for the protection of children and
youth. We pledge that we will devote to this goal the resources and
personnel necessary to accomplish it.</TE>
<TE>   We pledge that we will do our best to ordain to the priesthood and
put into positions of trust only those who share this commitment to
protecting children and youth. We pledge that we will work toward
healing and reconciliation for those sexually abused by clerics.</TE>

<HD>Oxnard Panel OKs Homes for Farm Workers</HD>
<DH>Construction: Villa Cesar Chavez development would contain
six houses and 52 apartments. City Council approval is expected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELENA GAONA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new housing development for farm workers that will be dedicated to
the late labor leader Cesar Chavez has received approval from Oxnard
planning officials.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a great victory," said a tearful Alfonso Villegas, whose
family has waited six years for a chance at owning a home. "It means
we can make our dream come true. And for other families too, not just
us."</LD>
<LD>   The Oxnard Planning Commission voted Thursday to approve
construction of the Villa Cesar Chavez development, which will
include six affordable single-family homes and 52 apartments
exclusively for farm workers.</LD>
<TE>   The City Council is expected to give final approval at its July 9
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The project calls for razing a collection of shacks in south
Oxnard that were built 60 years ago to house farm-worker families.</TE>
<TE>   The new development was made possible after former tenants won a
three-year legal battle over slum conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Tenants had reported that raw sewage flowed from broken pipes and
rain leaked into the small wooden houses that were infested with rats
and cockroaches. When they complained, their landlord tried to evict
them. The eight families involved then enlisted the help of legal aid
attorneys and fought to stay on the land.</TE>
<TE>   After winning a judgment against HR Inc. in 1998, the tenants
reached an out-of-court settlement in 2000 in which they each
received $10,000.</TE>
<TE>   The land was then sold to Cabrillo Economic Development, the
county's leading builder of low-income housing.</TE>
<TE>   Cabrillo officials said this is the biggest housing project for
farm workers in Ventura County since the development of Rancho Sespe
in Fillmore in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   That development houses more than 500 residents.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very significant because the farm workers themselves
identified the need for affordable housing," said attorney Barbara
Macri-Ortiz, who represented the eight families who will be given the
first opportunity to place bids on the new houses.</TE>
<TE>   "We could have gone to trial, and they would have gotten a lot of
money. Instead, they settled to be able to control the land and bring
home housing," said Macri-Ortiz.</TE>
<TE>   Construction could begin early next year, with completion set for
early 2004, said Yissel Barajas, project manager for Cabrillo.</TE>
<TE>   The six Craftsman-style houses included in the project are
targeted for families who earn 80% or less of the area's median
income. The apartments will be split between families who earn 50% or
less of the median income and those who earn 30% or less of the
median income.</TE>
<TE>   The price of the new homes will range from $162,000 for a
three-bedroom house to $172,000 for a four-bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   Apartment rents will vary from $439 to $980 a month, depending on
the size.</TE>
<TE>   Social services will also be available at the site through
partnerships with local agencies such as El Concilio and Clinicas del
Camino Real, Barajas said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a victory not only for Cabrillo but for all farm workers
in general," she said.</TE>

<HD>Probe Continues in Shooting Death of Man by CHP Officer</HD>
<DH>Crime: Authorities say the policeman fired in self-defense.
Victim is still unidentified.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles police and the California Highway Patrol continued their
investigation Friday into the shooting death of a man who attacked a
CHP officer at a vehicle-registration office in Tarzana.</LD>
<LD>   The 30-year-old man, whose name was not released pending
notification of his family, was trying to register a stolen
motorcycle on Thursday at the California Alternative Registration
Service office, which is linked to the Department of Motor Vehicles,
said CHP Officer Wendy Moore.</LD>
<LD>   After a computer identified the motorcycle as stolen, Officer
Daniel Margaris, a three-year veteran who works out of the CHP's West
Valley office in Woodland Hills, was dispatched to the scene in the
19300 block of Ventura Boulevard to investigate.</LD>
<TE>   When Margaris approached the man about 6 p.m., the officer was hit
in the head with a gun, starting a struggle, Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   "Fearing for his life, Margaris drew his weapon and fired at the
suspect," Moore said. The man died at the scene, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Darrell Pitts, 22, manager of the XS Sports store next door, said
he and co-worker Sean Hensley, 19, heard the scuffle and gunshots.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard a male voice shouting, 'Put the gun down! Put the gun
down!' Then we heard wrestling and then one shot," Pitts said. "Then
later, like two minutes later, we heard five or six shots and we all
hit the floor."</TE>
<TE>   Three registration office workers took cover in Pitts' store after
the first gunshot. No employees were hurt, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Margaris, who sustained a laceration on his forehead, a fractured
middle finger and several bruises, was transported to Encino-Tarzana
Regional Medical Center for treatment, Moore said.</TE>

<HD>William D'Angelo, 70; Producer of 'Love, American Style,'
'Alice'</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>William P. D'Angelo, producer of such television series hits as
"Love, American Style," "Room 222" and "Alice," who also created
innovative children's shows, including "Run, Joe, Run," has died. He
was 70.</LD>
<LD>   D'Angelo died June 8 in Los Angeles of pancreatic cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Raised in New York City, D'Angelo graduated from Fordham
University with little idea about what to do with his life. The Army
drafted him and assigned him to a film unit as a cameraman.</LD>
<TE>   After being discharged, D'Angelo worked briefly as an NBC page and
gofer, then moved to Los Angeles, where he was hired at Warner Bros.
as a story analyst. He worked his way up to writing and producing and
by 1966 was helping produce the television series "Batman."</TE>
<TE>   Within three years, he was producing episodes of "Room 222,"
"Love, American Style" and "The Young Lawyers." In the 1970s, he went
on to produce the series "Barefoot in the Park," "Alice," "Big John,
Little John" and "Turnabout" and the special "The Nativity." Along
the way, he worked for every major studio and helped produce episodes
of such favorites as "Maverick," "Cheyenne," "Lawman" and "Hawaiian
Eye."</TE>
<TE>   But D'Angelo wanted to start his own production company, and it
was children's television that gave him the chance in the mid-1970s.
The invitation came from Joe Teritero, then head of children's
programs for NBC, who wanted to add live-action shows to the standard
Saturday morning cartoons.</TE>
<TE>   Working with a tight budget, D'Angelo first delivered "Run, Joe,
Run." The show was something of a canine "Fugitive" starring his own
German shepherd, Heinrich, as the K-9 corps veteran of the Vietnam
War named Joe fleeing the former trainer he thinks is trying to kill
him.</TE>
<TE>   D'Angelo followed "Run, Joe, Run" with another children's series,
"Westwind." The show, which was filmed in Hawaii, was about an
underwater photographer who lived on a boat with his marine biologist
wife and their two teenage children.</TE>
<TE>   Building on such successes, D'Angelo wrote and produced a show
about his own background for "NBC Special Treat," an afternoon
dramatic series for young people. Aired in 1976, "Papa and Me"
centered on events surrounding the death of D'Angelo's grandfather, a
Brooklyn barber who loved getting his grandson in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Under what became D'Angelo-Bullock-Allen Productions, the producer
also created the children's series "The Monster Squad."</TE>
<TE>   D'Angelo is survived by his wife, Joan; son, William; daughter,
Christine; and a sister, Mary Rose.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. Wednesday at the
Writers Guild of America, 135 S. Doheny Drive, Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The family has requested that donations be sent to the Jonsson
Cancer Center Foundation, the Factor Building, Room 8-950, Box 95170,
Los Angeles, CA 90095, and designated for pancreatic cancer research.</TE>

<HD>Capistrano Question: Can Clothesline Stop a Train?</HD>
<DH>Protest: Residents show their opposition to plans for a
second track downtown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three dozen people protesting plans for a second railroad track
through San Juan Capistrano's historic downtown aired their laundry
Friday, stringing garments on a 15-foot clothesline across tracks at
the old depot.</LD>
<LD>   They waved signs and chanted "De-rail the rail!" as
law-enforcement officers and onlookers gathered around the orderly
demonstration.</LD>
<LD>   Demonstrator Boots Leone said residents who would be affected by
the project, including those in San Clemente and Dana Point, have to
make noise.</LD>
<TE>   "The city's hands are tied without us kicking up a fuss," said
Leone, in red long johns, a derby hat and mock sheriff's badge. "They
ain't going to ram it through here."</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans, one of the agencies working on the plan, has proposed
several options for more trains to travel at higher speeds along the
Southern California coast. San Juan Capistrano residents are
particularly upset about a proposed two-mile tunnel with double
tracks from north of the old mission to the city's Descanso Veterans
Park.</TE>
<TE>   "We welcome public input, and we want to know about all the
different issues that are out there in the community, because the
people who live and do business near the tracks will be the ones most
impacted by the project," said Caltrans spokeswoman Sandy Friedman,
who plans to hold a public meeting on the plan in August. "The
project is still in the conceptual phase."</TE>
<TE>   A downtown parking structure and possibly the historic train depot
would be demolished if the track is added.</TE>
<TE>   The tunnel is one of several ideas for the Los Angeles-San Diego
corridor as part of a $10-billion proposal for improving rail
transportation statewide. The current single track through south
Orange County frequently has to accommodate northbound and southbound
freight and passenger trains, and sidings have to be used.</TE>
<TE>   As blouses, skirts, jeans, shorts, shirts and dresses rustled on
the clothesline in the morning breeze, protesters voiced their
objections.</TE>
<TE>   Their tactics were reminiscent of those used by Modesta Avila, who
blocked the Santa Fe Railroad in 1889 by hanging a clothesline
crowded with garments across the tracks. Authorities tore down the
line and arrested Avila, 22, who was charged with "attempted
obstruction of a train." She became Orange County's first convicted
felon, according to local historians, and died at San Quentin prison
while serving her three-year sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Schwartze, organizer of Friday's demonstration, said early
mobilization against the project is essential.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to alert elected officials who are making the decisions
in Sacramento and Washington, D.C., because we don't think they
recognize the dramatic impact their decisions will have on our
historic and cultural community."</TE>
<TE>   Schwartz, who said he's been following the rail issue for 27
years, said the project has been "boiling along all those years, and
now we think things are starting to boil over."</TE>
<TE>   San Juan Capistrano, which draws flocks of swallows, artists and
tourists each year, is one of California's oldest cities and has
fought to maintain its small-town charm. Los Rios Historic District,
where original adobes still stand, is listed on the National Register
of Historic Places. The 226-year-old mission is the town's crown
jewel.</TE>
<TE>   Preservationists and residents said they fear that vibrations from
the added track would damage the old structures.</TE>
<TE>   Artist Luis Arturo Guevara set up an easel and painted protest
scenes. "I'm so very upset. I wish I could tie myself to the railroad
tracks if the police didn't stop me," said Guevara, 51, who has built
a wooden shed and planted a garden of wildflowers along the tracks.
"I don't want them to raze or disturb our historic landmarks and all
this quiet beauty. They're going to ruin the face of Capistrano with
more loud, noisy trains. It's the worst idea that anyone can come up
with."</TE>

<HD>Fire Crews Have 2 Angeles Forest Blazes in Hand</HD>
<DH>Control: Thanks to an assist from the weather, Gorman and
Wildwood fires should both be fully contained by this morning,
officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY THERMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Aided by unseasonably damp weather, firefighters declared victory
Friday night over two fires that chewed through 1,650 acres of brush
this week in Angeles National Forest.</LD>
<LD>   By 6 p.m., no flames were visible among the smoking ruins and
bulldozers finished cutting fuel breaks around the 1,500-acre Gorman
fire, about 50 miles northwest of Los Angeles. The 150-acre Wildwood
fire in Big Tujunga Canyon, about 15 miles northeast of the city, was
expected to be fully contained by early today.</LD>
<LD>   Crews remained at both scenes overnight to watch for flare-ups.</LD>
<TE>   Causes of the fires were under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   As the first day of summer dawned, crews battling the Wildwood
fire found themselves enveloped in heavy fog, U.S. Forest Service
spokeswoman Susie Wood said, adding that the drizzly weather "really
helped."</TE>
<TE>   The Gorman fire, also called the Copco fire, destroyed three
outbuildings. About 40 structures, including homes and recreational
cabins, were initially in the path of the Wildwood fire, but fire
officials did not feel the threat was sufficient to order
evacuations.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the cost of fighting the Gorman fire was about $1
million, and the Wildwood fire cost was about $300,000.</TE>
<TE>   Wood said firefighting crews are hoping for a respite from a
string of fires that has devoured brush land all over California. In
recent weeks the Forest Service has been continuously "moving crews
and equipment from one fire to the next," she said. "It's going to be
a rough season."</TE>
<TE>   Officials said Friday they were investigating whether a
21,000-acre blaze burning near Yosemite National Park was sparked by
a campfire used by U.S. Marine mountain warfare trainees. The blaze,
which began burning last week, was 30% contained Friday, but earlier
had forced the evacuation of the town of Walker. Three firefighters
were also killed in an air tanker crash.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in San Diego County, the Troy fire was expected to be
fully contained Friday night after burning 1,500 acres and three
cabins.</TE>

<HD>Plan for Gym Splits Groups in Little Tokyo</HD>
<DH>Dispute: Japanese American veterans and others want green
space to set off museums.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>K. CONNIE KANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite broad community support for a proposed gymnasium in Little
Tokyo, backers are facing stiff opposition from an alliance of
powerful arts groups and a Japanese American veterans organization.</LD>
<LD>   During a heated public forum Thursday night in Little Tokyo, about
500 supporters of the Little Tokyo Recreation Center, many of them
youngsters, urged city officials to approve the gym on the city-owned
land known as First Street North.</LD>
<LD>   But representatives of the Japanese American National Museum, East
West Players and veterans of the 100th Battalion/442nd Regimental
Combat Team said they wanted to see the site used as an "art
park"--green space to set off the existing and planned museums in the
vicinity.</LD>
<TE>   The session, called by City Councilwoman Jan Perry, whose district
includes Little Tokyo, gave a rare glimpse into a division in the
Japanese American community, this one in effect pitting grandchildren
against grandfathers and old friends against one another.</TE>
<TE>   "It's heart-wrenching," said Tony Ricasa, principal assistant to
Democratic Assemblyman Gilbert Cedillo, whose district includes
Little Tokyo. "They shouldn't be pitted up against each other. All of
them can benefit" from the project.</TE>
<TE>   Cedillo supports the gym at First Street North, which also houses
the Museum of Contemporary Art's Geffen Contemporary, the Japanese
American National Museum, the Go for Broke Monument to Japanese
American veterans of World War II, and the Union Center for the Arts.
It is also the site of the future city Children's Museum.</TE>
<TE>   Ricasa said the gym would expose youngsters to culture and art in
the museums and at the veterans monument.</TE>
<TE>   But Ted Ohira, who served in the 442nd, one of the most decorated
units in U.S. military history, argued that putting the gym there
would betray supporters of the Go for Broke Monument.</TE>
<TE>   "We veterans have always been assured by the city before we built
the monument that the place is going to be a park and a Japanese
garden to show the people our story--to tell our story," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Watanabe, executive director of the Little Tokyo Service
Center, whose organization eight years ago led the campaign to build
the gym, said there is enough land to accommodate the center and open
green space. He said the project would also be an economic boon to
Little Tokyo businesses and institutions, including those opposing
it.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Mayeda, board president of the East West Players, said noise
from the gym would disrupt the "nation's premier Asian American
theater." He told gym supporters to put themselves for a moment in
his shoes.</TE>
<TE>   "Suppose you invested millions of dollars to create a gymnasium,
and then a theater wants to come right next to you and said, "Oh, by
the way, no basketball on weekends because that's when we have
performances and need you to be quiet. Your reaction would be, 'We
were here first. Your use is incompatible with ours, so you have to
go somewhere else.' That's our situation."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Heller, project manager for the Children's Museum, who was
introduced as a speaker opposing the gym, surprised many by
supporting the center.</TE>
<TE>   "I may lose my job, but frankly, I think it is a great plan, said
Heller, who said he had seen the plan for the first time Thursday
evening. "I was supposed to come here to make it [the gym] smaller,
but after seeing the presentation ... maybe we should make ours [the
Children's Museum] smaller," he said.</TE>

<HD>Caroline Knapp, 42; Wrote of Alcohol Struggle</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Caroline Knapp, a journalist and author who detailed her struggle
with alcoholism with candor and eloquence in the bestselling memoir,
"Drinking: A Love Story," has died. She was 42.</LD>
<LD>   Knapp died June 3 at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. The
cause of death was complications from lung cancer.</LD>
<LD>   A slight book and one of relatively few in the literature of
alcoholism written from a woman's point of view, "Drinking" was a
bestseller when it was released in 1996 and earned generally positive
reviews. Knapp became a familiar figure on talk shows, including "CBS
This Morning" and "Oprah," and was profiled in People magazine and
the New York Times.</LD>
<TE>   Knapp was raised in Cambridge. Her father was a prominent
psychiatrist and professor at Boston University. Her mother was an
artist.</TE>
<TE>   High-strung and with behavior patterns that would later be seen as
obsessive, Knapp was a bright student who attended an exclusive prep
school. She later graduated with honors from Brown.</TE>
<TE>   She became a respected journalist, working first at the Boston
Business Journal and then the Boston Phoenix, an alternative
newspaper, where she was a writer and editor.</TE>
<TE>   At the Phoenix she wrote a column called "Out There" about a
semi-fictional professional woman in her early 30s named Alice K.,
which Knapp noted dryly was not her real middle initial.</TE>
<TE>   Her first book, "Alice K.'s Guide to Life: One Woman's Quest for
Survival, Sanity and the Perfect New Shoes," was a collection of her
Alice K. columns.</TE>
<TE>   She explored the boundaries of love in the book "Pack of Two: The
Intricate Bond Between People and Dogs," which detailed her
relationship with her dog Lucille.</TE>
<TE>   But "Drinking: a Love Story" was her most influential book. It
chronicled a life that to most outward appearances seemed orderly and
highly successful. "High functioning" is what she termed it.</TE>
<TE>   Knapp recalled that she had her first drink at age 12 or 13 and
was getting drunk periodically by her sophomore year in high school.
She was 16 when she got drunk in secret for the first time after a
troubling phone conversation with a boy she thought was going to
break up with her. She started a habit that was to steadily worsen
over the next 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   She was, she wrote, "smooth and ordered on the outside; roiling
and chaotic and desperately secretive underneath, but not noticeably
so, never noticeably so."</TE>
<TE>   And that desperate secretiveness was begging for some relief. She
found it in the bottle.</TE>
<TE>   "Drinking had a lubricating effect that altered the dynamic,"
Knapp said in an interview some years ago. "It turned me into the
person I thought I was supposed to be: more confident, less shy,
prettier."</TE>
<TE>   She also wrote candidly of her difficult relationships with men
and how alcohol contributed to the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "Alcohol felt like the cement in female sexuality, at least it did
to me: Over the years the two would become so deeply linked that for
the longest time I simply couldn't imagine one without the other. A
first kiss without drinks? Forget it. Sex without liquor? No way.
Drinking was as integral to my sense of sexuality as a body part: no
more, no less."</TE>
<TE>   But as her drinking progressed, her ability to manage it declined.
And although she never lost a job or went to jail because of her
drinking, she was caught in the downward spiral that most alcoholics
face.</TE>
<TE>   As she told it, her moment of truth came after a drunken incident
involving the young daughters of a friend on Thanksgiving weekend in
1993. After hoisting the older of the two girls onto her back and
bidding the youngest to hang onto her neck, Knapp started running
uncontrollably across the street and fell, lacerating her knee.
Although the girls were uninjured, Knapp was shaken by the
realization that the youngest girl, who was 5, had narrowly escaped
hitting her head on the curb.</TE>
<TE>   In early 1994 Knapp entered a rehab program and maintained her
sobriety with continued psychotherapy and Alcoholics Anonymous
meetings.</TE>
<TE>   She fought--and won--a battle with anorexia. She was less
successful breaking a serious cigarette habit. In that context,
"Drinking" is full of ironic passages, perhaps none so moving as
Knapp's account of a conversation she had with her mother about her
drinking.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother was the sort of person who chose her words with the
utmost care, and I understood that a wealth of meanings ran beneath
that simple phrase: more serious than smoking. Smoking causes cancer,
a disease that was killing my father, that had killed several women
in her family, that would kill her just a few years later. She
understood that drinking was more dangerous and she understood why:
smoking could ruin my body; drinking could ruin my mind and my
future."</TE>
<TE>   Knapp started smoking in her 20s and never stopped. She was
diagnosed with lung cancer in April, and married her longtime friend
Mark Morelli, a photographer, in early May, just weeks before her
death.</TE>

<LD>Police Friday night recovered a 10-month-old boy missing since
Thursday when his mother asked a transient woman she had met in
downtown Los Angeles to look after him for a few hours.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said Stephanie Havatone, 30, left Elias Chavez at 628
S. San Julian St. about 11 a.m. with Denise Sanchez, who is homeless.</LD>
<LD>   Police did not elaborate on why Havatone had asked a transient to
take care of her child. It's unclear how well the women knew each
other.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday night, Sanchez walked into the police department with
the child, who appeared to be in good health, police said. Police
were interviewing her.</TE>

<HD>UC Nurses Ratify Pact</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NERISSA PACIO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nurses at the University of California's five medical centers voted
overwhelmingly Friday to ratify a contract praised by union leaders
as historic.</LD>
<LD>   The contract, which received 95% approval from the system's 8,000
nurses, pays them based on seniority and boosts salaries an average
of 19% to 25% over the next three years. It eliminates the merit
pay-based system the nurses have battled.</LD>
<LD>   "This goes to the heart of recruitment and retention in the most
comprehensive agreement we've seen in this country," Rose Ann DeMoro,
executive director of the 45,000-member California Nurses Assn., said
after the vote. "Nurses are leaving hospitals in droves.... What we
sought to do in this contract is reverse that trend."</LD>
<TE>   The contract comes after four months of negotiations that were
sometimes marked by bitterness, charges of unfair labor practices and
the threat of a strike.</TE>
<TE>   UC officials had sought a restraining order against a strike,
which they said might force them to close trauma centers.</TE>
<TE>   But when agreement was reached in late May, UC officials said the
new program would benefit all sides, especially patients.</TE>

<LD>There are few things as annoying about life in Southern California as
the cutesy tones of ringing cell phones in public places, followed by
loud, one-sided conversations. I even had to listen to one yammering
idiot in a doctor's waiting room the other day.</LD>
<LD>   Well, Wally Schultz of Rancho Cucamonga knows of one restaurant
with a unique approach to avoiding such problems. The only catch is
that it's more than 6,000 miles away--in northern Italy.</LD>
<LD>   "The proprietor, a gruff grandpa-type, scrutinized each customer
before he seated them, demanding their cell phones," Schultz said.
"How did he keep 'em away from the customers? Take a look--each
compartment has its own lock, and the diners from each table get one
cubbyhole and the key to it (see photo).</LD>
<TE>   "The complete inscription on the cabinet is 'Deposito telefoni
portatili per la tranquillita di tuti,' which translates as 'Deposit
portable telephones for the tranquillity of all.' '' We hear you.</TE>
<TE>   Such a deal: Jerry Biggs of Redlands noticed that a carwash was
offering a $2 discount--not much when you consider the regular price
(see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Almost like home: So, when the Dodgers acquired Canadian-born
pitcher Paul Quantrill in the off-season, where did he make his home?
La Canada, of course.</TE>
<TE>   You beat us this time, Sacramento! The Lakers may have whipped the
Kings in the NBA playoffs, but Sacramento came out ahead of L.A. in
another competition: America's Sweatiest Cities. Sacramento ranked
21st, ahead of Fresno (36), L.A. (47) and San Diego (48) in a poll
released by the deodorant maker Old Spice. No. 1 was San Antonio,
where residents walking outside purportedly sweat as much as a liter
per hour on a summer day.</TE>
<TE>   The rankings were based on the average heights and weights of
residents and on the average temperatures and humidities of the
cities in the summer. Oddly, Seattle ranked right behind San Diego,
at 49. I wonder if the researchers mistook raindrops for sweat drops?</TE>
<TE>   Health update: I'm over my case of World Cup fever. Thanks for all
your cards and letters.</TE>
<TE>   Weak Cover Stories Dept.: In the "burglary" section of its police
log, the Beach Reporter said residents of a Manhattan Beach home
heard noises in the middle of the night "and found two men sitting on
the couch." The intruders started to leave, but when a male resident
"told them to sit back down on the couch, they complied. The two men
said they entered the residence through the kitchen window and
thought they were in someone else's house. When the residents asked
why they came through the kitchen window, they said they did not know
why." Nothing was taken. Police were summoned and arrested the
hapless twosome.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: I heard an ad that said of a new TV series: "No
script! No actors!" Isn't that the way most sitcoms are made?</TE>

<HD>Up Close and Personal With the Sea Gulls</HD>
<DH>Program takes fifth-graders out to Anacapa Island to learn
about the western gulls that nest there.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ANACAPA ISLAND, Calif.</DL>
<LD>"Don't run. Shuffle your feet," the naturalist tells the
fifth-graders. That's a tall order for 10- and 11-year-olds who have
been cooped up on a boat and are ready to scamper up the trails on
this wind-swept island.</LD>
<LD>   When they round the first bend, all of the rules make sense.</LD>
<LD>   Baby sea gulls are everywhere. Nests pop up every 20 feet.
Clueless chicks, camouflaged by downy, mottled black and tan
feathers, wander in every direction.</LD>
<TE>   It sometimes takes the squawking, swooping protests of a parent
gull to ward off disaster between wayward chick and oncoming foot.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at the babies!" squeals one fifth-grader in a pink
sweatshirt. She points to her discovery: a pair of fuzzy chicks
rising on unsteady legs. One stumbles and plops on its side in a
cartoonish pratfall.</TE>
<TE>   "Look how cute they are," another girl says, clutching her hands
to her heart. "I want to take one home."</TE>
<TE>   Every spring, thousands of schoolchildren stumble on to one of
Southern California's best-kept secrets: the western gulls that nest
in the little-visited Channel Islands National Park.</TE>
<TE>   It's the ultimate field trip, or so these students and their
teachers say. School groups make up about 25% of the park's 37,000
visitors, brought by boats run by Island Packers, the park's
principle concessionaire.</TE>
<TE>   On the 45-minute boat ride to Anacapa, students saw dolphins
frolicking in the waves off the bow. Often, these groups see whales.</TE>
<TE>   On the island, they took a virtual walk through the kelp forest
with Ranger Bill Faulkner. While Faulkner slipped into the chilly,
emerald water, the students stayed on land huddled around television
monitors. They watched him through underwater video cameras and
peppered him with questions, using a transceiver built into his dive
mask.</TE>
<TE>   When Faulkner climbed up the ladder to the landing, he was mobbed
by the fifth-graders. He held out his black swim fins for the
students to touch. Some of the braver ones felt his wetsuit. Yes, it
was wet. Their touch made it real. It was the same suit they had just
seen on TV.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of these students have no experience with the ocean," said
Andrea Moe, coordinator of the yearlong Los Marineros marine
education program. This year, it enrolled all of Santa Barbara's
fifth-graders.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of these schools are two blocks from the beach and yet these
kids never set foot on the sand," Moe said. "They'd never seen a tide
pool or ridden in a boat until we take them out."</TE>
<TE>   This time of year, students get a special treat. They get very
close--sometimes too close--to the nests of western gulls.</TE>
<TE>   "If the birds are squawking, keep on walking," naturalist Monica
Baker tells the 73 students on this trip from Franklin Elementary
School in Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   Ranger Dave Begun lays down some national park rules: Don't take
anything home with you. Be careful where you step. Don't chase the
fuzzy chicks, no matter how much you want to pet them.</TE>
<TE>   "The mother and father will see us as a threat and start
divebombing you," he warns.</TE>
<TE>   "Cool!" says an 11-year-old boy.</TE>
<TE>   "It may sound cool, but what comes out of sea gulls?" the ranger
asks the circle of children.</TE>
<TE>   "Poopie!" several of them shout in unison.</TE>
<TE>   "Right. If the sea gull divebombs you, they will try to get a
little poopie right on you."</TE>
<TE>   Message delivered.</TE>
<TE>   Anacapa Island, one of three spots on the Channel Islands used by
western gulls for nesting, offers unusual access to chicks born in
the wild.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many birds, gulls are fairly bold with humans. Just ask
anyone who has fed gulls at the beach, or watched these airborne
scavengers--sometimes nicknamed sky rats--squabble over scraps from
fishing boats or municipal dumps.</TE>
<TE>   On Anacapa Island, people see a different side of gulls. Western
gulls pair up and share parental tasks.</TE>
<TE>   While one guards the nest, the other goes fishing, returning to
regurgitate the catch.</TE>
<TE>   "By mid-July, all of the chicks will be the same size as their
parents," said Ranger Tom Dore. That's when they try to fly, with
spectacular and comical crash-landings.</TE>
<TE>   "By the end of August, there is not a bird left on the island,"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

Tuesdays and Thursdays through Labor Day. For park information, call

<HD>Antonia Pantoja, 80; Activist Helped Puerto Ricans in U.S.</HD>

<LD>Antonia Pantoja, a social worker by training and social architect by
instinct who filled a leadership void in the Puerto Rican immigrant
community by building several lasting educational and political
institutions, died of cancer May 24 in a New York City hospital. She
was 80.</LD>
<LD>   Her best-known contribution is Aspira, a national nonprofit
organization that she launched in 1961 to address the poor
educational attainment of Puerto Rican and other Latino youths. It
won a landmark class-action lawsuit in 1974 that led to bilingual
education in New York City schools and has trained several
generations of Puerto Rican leaders.</LD>
<LD>   "She really stands out as a unique figure in our history," said
Angelo Falcon, senior policy executive at the Puerto Rican Legal
Defense and Education Fund. "She was the single most important figure
in the development of the Puerto Rican community in New York City and
nationally."</LD>
<TE>   Aggressive, opinionated and articulate, she was awarded the
Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Clinton in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Born out of wedlock, Pantoja was raised by her grandparents in San
Juan, Puerto Rico, where childhood experiences awakened her to
injustice. In a memoir published last month, she recalled seeing her
grandfather, a factory foreman, carried into the house after he had
been burned with hot lard by strikebreakers.</TE>
<TE>   She trained as a schoolteacher at the University of Puerto Rico
and taught disadvantaged students for two years after graduating in
1942. Although she found teaching satisfying, she felt constrained by
social and cultural expectations. As an unmarried woman, she was
expected to support her mother, who had married and whose husband was
jobless because of a disability. "Suffocating with emotions and
responsibilities" and yearning for a freer life, she left Puerto Rico
for New York City in 1944.</TE>
<TE>   She found work as a welder on the assembly line of a radio
factory, and later as a designer in a company that made lampshades.
In the latter job she began to organize workers to improve conditions
in the factory.</TE>
<TE>   In 1950 she enrolled in Hunter College, where she earned a
bachelor's degree in sociology. In 1954 she obtained a master's in
social work from Columbia University. She later would earn a
doctorate from Union Graduate School in Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   At Hunter, Pantoja began to connect with other Puerto Rican
immigrants in New York--"Nuyoricans," she called them. Most people in
the growing number of immigrants were poor, lived in substandard
housing and were not well educated. But they lacked the influence to
draw policymakers' attention to their needs. In 1953 Pantoja formed
the community's first major advocacy group, the Hispanic Young Adult
Assn., which later was renamed the Puerto Rican Assn. for Community
Affairs. She served as its first president.</TE>
<TE>   In 1958, she helped establish another major group, the National
Puerto Rican Forum, which was conceived as a launching pad for
institutions to serve the Puerto Rican community.</TE>
<TE>   Its first offspring was Aspira, which was born out of discussions
Pantoja had with Puerto Rican high school students in New York.
Hearing about their poor self-images and problems with teachers,
gangs and the police, Pantoja wanted to find a way to empower them
and make them leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Aspira's name was taken from the command form of the Spanish verb
for aspire. "We all wished the meaning would be 'I will aspire and I
will attain,' " Pantoja wrote in "Memoir of a Visionary: Antonia
Pantoja," published by Arte Publico Press.</TE>
<TE>   Aspira fostered the development of high school clubs to support
students who wanted to attend college. To compete with the gang
fascination with initiations, Pantoja conceived a ceremony based on a
ritual of the Taino Indians in which students light candles and
pledge to pursue educational excellence. Her idea for the group's
insignia was the pitirre, a small bird known for its speed and
ability to soar to great heights.</TE>
<TE>   Today Aspira is a federation of clubs that serves 50,000 Puerto
Rican and other Latino students, providing career and college
counseling, financial aid and other support. Its graduates include
Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties
Union; Fernando Ferrer, a former Bronx borough president who ran for
New York City mayor last year; and the actor Jimmy Smits.</TE>
<TE>   Aspira's advocacy for Spanish-speaking students in New York City
resulted in a federal consent decree in 1974 that allowed them to be
taught some subjects in Spanish. The settlement affected as many as
65,000 of the city's 1.1 million pupils.</TE>
<TE>   Pantoja directed Aspira from 1961 to 1966, then turned her focus
to higher education. She founded the bilingual Universidad Boricua
(now Boricua College) and the Puerto Rican Research and Resource
Center in Washington in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   In 1974 she joined the faculty at San Diego State University's
School of Social Work. She later founded, with her partner and
colleague, Wilhelmina Perry, the independent Graduate School for
Community Development in San Diego, which trained activists to
analyze and build solutions to community problems.</TE>
<TE>   In 1984 she and Perry moved to Puerto Rico, where Pantoja intended
to retire. Instead, she created Producir, an organization devoted to
economic development in poor rural areas, and Pro-vivienda, which
concentrated on improving housing. She left in 1998 when she realized
that she belonged "in New York with Nuyoricans."</TE>
<TE>   She was an energetic activist leader until her death. Awarded a
grant to write her autobiography, she used the money as an organizing
tool.</TE>
<TE>   She convened a meeting of the founders of the groups she helped
establish, running essentially an oral history project of the
community.</TE>
<TE>   When she died she was working to organize a credit union and raise
funds for a building to house the city's Puerto Rican nonprofit
groups.</TE>
<TE>   She is survived by Perry; a brother, Esteban Lopez; and a sister,
Haydee Lopez.</TE>

<HD>Removed School Paper Advisor Says Opinion Pieces Did Her In</HD>
<DH>Education: Garden Grove instructor says she lost her
journalism post because of student writings. Principal can't be
reached.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The opinion pieces seem standard high school newspaper fare: The
cafeteria food stinks, the bathrooms are dirty and many teachers
aren't around when students need them.</LD>
<LD>   But Janet Ewell, journalism advisor for seven years to the
award-winning student newspaper at Rancho Alamitos High School in
Garden Grove, said those stories cost her her post.</LD>
<LD>   Principal Gene Campbell, who had taken her to task for those
stories, has told her that next year, instead of teaching the
journalism class that puts out La Nueva Voz, Ewell will teach only
English classes.</LD>
<TE>   "He told me the paper needed to take a new direction," Ewell said.
"He's given no other reason for my ouster other than the contents of
the paper. He would like it to be a public relations tool for the
school rather than a voice for the students."</TE>
<TE>   The 52-year-old teacher said the newspaper took up half her
workload although it was just a fifth of her assignment. "But having
said that, it is one of the most gratifying parts of my teaching."</TE>
<TE>   High school newspapers, like the rest of the media, are protected
by the 1st Amendment. In addition, the state Education Code prevents
administrators from censoring student papers unless the contents are
libelous, obscene or would pose a threat to students, said Jim Ewert,
legal counsel for the California Newspaper Publishers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   A principal cannot reassign an advisor solely because of
objections to the publication's content, Ewert said.</TE>
<TE>   Steve O'Donoghue, director of the High School Newspaper Support
Program, in Oakland, called the decision the "kill-the-advisor
strategy. When adults don't like what children write, they get rid of
the advisor."</TE>
<TE>   Campbell did not return calls. Alan Trudell, spokesman for the
Garden Grove Unified School District, said Ewell's removal was a
personnel matter and that he could not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Ewell met this week with district administrators. She said they
insisted she was a bad teacher because the stories didn't contain
both sides.</TE>
<TE>   She said she tried to explain that they appeared on the editorial
page, which is for opinions, and not the news pages.</TE>
<TE>   Ewell scheduled the journalism class at 7 a.m. so it wouldn't
conflict with students' other classes, and so she would get dedicated
students.</TE>
<TE>   Cindy Tran, heading to UCLA in the fall, has been business manager
for four years. "Mrs. Ewell is great," she said. "She shows up every
morning. That's part of the reason I show up every morning at 7 a.m.
I figure if she's going to show up at that time and put the time in,
I will too."</TE>
<TE>   The first controversial writing complained about bathrooms, the
second about the cafeteria, and the third about an alleged lack of
teachers at lunch and before and after school, Ewell said.</TE>
<TE>   She said Campbell asked for a retraction after the third, but the
students said no. They did print teachers' letters criticizing the
article.</TE>

<TE>   She said she tried to explain that they appeared on the editorial

<TE>   She Resurrected Paper</TE>
<TE>   Ewell was an English teacher and journalism advisor at Santiago
High in Garden Grove when she was transferred to Rancho Alamitos in
1995 to resurrect the school newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   She has scrambled for money and equipment for the paper, receiving
donations of computers and cameras and a $1,000 grant from the Orange
County Press Club.</TE>
<TE>   Ewell scheduled the journalism class at 7 a.m. so it wouldn't
conflict with students' other classes, and so she would get dedicated
students.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say of all my classes, I learned the most from her," said
senior Iris Pham, co-editor of the paper.</TE>
<TE>   Cindy Tran, heading to UCLA in the fall, has been business manager
for four years. "Mrs. Ewell is great," she said. "She shows up every
morning. That's part of the reason I show up every morning at 7 a.m.
I figure if she's going to show up at that time and put the time in,
I will too."</TE>
<TE>   Ewell said the story ideas and headlines come from her students.
She's there to instruct them and make sure they don't libel anyone.
"I teach them to research, and then they get dangerous," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The first controversial writing appeared Nov. 7, 2000, in an
editorial that complained there were not enough toilets and that the
bathrooms "are only suitable for barnyard animals, not humans." The
paper printed the addresses of school board members so students could
write to them, which upset Campbell, Ewell said.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 19, 2001, news editor James Le wrote an opinion piece
saying there were bugs and hair in cafeteria meals, that day-old food
was served, and prices weren't consistent.</TE>
<TE>   Ewell said Campbell told her the story had upset the cafeteria
staff and that there were several inaccuracies.</TE>
<TE>   She said she went over the story with her students and found it
accurate.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most controversial opinion piece appeared Jan. 29,
2002. This one said that too many teachers are not around before and
after school or at lunchtime to help students.</TE>
<TE>   Retraction Sought</TE>
<TE>   This time, Campbell asked for a retraction, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Ewell went back to her students and they said no. In the next
issue, they printed lengthy letters from six teachers criticizing the
story.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell told Ewell on April 22 that she was being reassigned from
the journalism post and losing the $1,800 stipend that comes with it.</TE>
<TE>   Ewell closed the door to her classroom the next day and told her
students.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Stephanie Baggert, 16, arrived late to class that day
and said she saw Ewell crying.</TE>
<TE>   When she learned why, she said, she and another student marched to
the principal's office.</TE>
<TE>   They asked him if the article on the teachers was the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "He said it was a piece, but it wasn't the final straw," Stephanie
said. "He said he wanted the paper to have different points of view."</TE>
<TE>   Ewell said she cannot afford to sue over the matter.</TE>
<TE>   All along, she has been hoping that she could resolve the dispute
by explaining things to district officials, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I've lost my cover as a sweet little English teacher," she said.</TE>

<LD>Mary A. Dieli, 46, who designed some of the first software to make
computers easier to use, died June 14 in Seattle after an 18-month
battle with breast cancer.</LD>
<LD>   The Brooklyn-born Dieli earned a doctorate in rhetoric at Carnegie
Mellon University before going to work for Apple Computer. At Apple
in the early 1980s, she helped design the Lisa operating system, one
of the first commercially available systems to move away from
commands that had to be typed.</LD>
<LD>   After moving to Seattle in 1988, Dieli established two computer
usability laboratories for the study of human-computer interaction at
Microsoft Corp. Her work was used in designing the Windows 2.1 and
Windows 95 user interfaces.</LD>
<TE>   Most recently, she started a consulting business and worked with
Cisco Systems, Netscape, Hewlett-Packard and Dow Jones Inc.</TE>

<LD>Guilford Dudley Jr., 94, an ambassador to Denmark in the Nixon
administration who later served as chairman of the trustees
established to liquidate President Richard M. Nixon's campaign funds
after his resignation in the Watergate scandal, died June 13 at his
home in Nashville of causes associated with old age.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Nashville, Dudley earned his bachelor's degree from
Vanderbilt University and was a naval officer in the Pacific during
World War II. After the war he returned to the insurance business in
his home state, eventually becoming president of Life &amp; Casualty
Insurance Co. of Tennessee.</LD>
<LD>   Named ambassador to Denmark in 1969, Dudley served until 1971 and
became a business consultant in the Nixon White House. He eventually
returned to Life &amp; Casualty as the firm's chairman.</LD>
<TE>   As chairman of the Campaign Liquidation Trust, Dudley was charged
with dispersing nearly $4 million contributed to Nixon's 1972
Committee for the Re-Election of the President or, as it was more
commonly known, CREEP. The trust completed the process in 1985, with
most of the money going to pay legal fees of those charged but not
convicted of wrongdoing in the Watergate scandal.</TE>

<LD>Wu Lengxi, 83, a former head of the official New China News Agency
and an ardent supporter of the late Communist leader Mao Tse-tung,
died Sunday in Beijing. The cause of death was not reported.</LD>
<LD>   Wu, who also served as editor-in-chief of the Communist Party's
flagship newspaper People's Daily and vice minister of propaganda,
joined the party in 1938 at its wartime base in the northern town of
Yanan. He started as a reporter with the New China News Agency and
the Liberation Daily, the predecessor to the People's Daily. During
the early years of Communist rule, he was appointed to run the two
party organs.</LD>
<LD>   Despite his loyalty to Mao, he was driven from power in 1966 at
the start of the Cultural Revolution. He resurfaced in 1972, and
eventually was made honorary president of the government-controlled
All China Journalists Assn. and the state broadcast and television
institute.</LD>

<HD>Marvin Paymer, 81; Pianist, Expert on 18th Century Italian
Composer</HD>

<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marvin Paymer, pianist, composer, musicologist and author who was an
expert on the 18th century Italian composer Giovanni Battista
Pergolesi, died June 14 in San Diego of cancer, according to his son,
actor David Paymer. He was 81.</LD>
<LD>   A native of New York City, Marvin Paymer earned degrees at the
University of Hartford, Queens College and City University of New
York. He taught at City University of New York's York College and at
Hunter College. In 1977, he co-founded and, until his retirement in
1993, served as associate director of the Pergolesi Research Center
at City University of New York Graduate Center.</LD>
<LD>   Managing editor of the 26-volume "The New Pergolesi Edition,"
Paymer also wrote "G.B. Pergolesi: A Thematic Catalog of the Opera
Omnia" and "The Instrumental Music Attributed to G.B. Pergolesi: A
Study in Authenticity" and co-authored "The Pergolesi Hand: A
Calligraphic Study." Paymer authenticated 13 Pergolesi compositions
among hundreds of fakes attributed to the posthumously famous
composer, who died at the age of 26. Paymer said he used stylistic
analysis in addition to such evidence as watermarks, ink, paper and
documentation to determine whether a score was written by Pergolesi.</LD>
<TE>   Paymer also wrote books about more recent music, including "Facts
Behind the Songs" in 1993 and "Sentimental Journey" in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   A musician in his own right, Paymer played in New York nightclubs
and with Louis Armstrong in his youth. In recent years, he gave
lecture recitals around San Diego and played piano at the Top of the
Cove in La Jolla. Among his many awards were fellowships from the
National Endowment for the Humanities and the Andrew W. Mellon
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Besides his son, Paymer is survived by his wife, Edythe; another
son, Jon Lach; a daughter, Madeleine Kessner; and seven
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial donations in his name may be made to the Wellness
Community-West Los Angeles, 2716 Ocean Park Blvd., Suite 1040, Santa
Monica, CA 90405.</TE>

<HD>Where Fields of Green Lead to Dirty Rivers</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: As more pesticides are found in Central Valley
waters, the state is poised to finally crack down on the use of
chemicals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTINA BOXALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CROWS LANDING, Calif.</DL>
<LD>The Central Valley's Holy Trinity of sun, dirt and water embraced Tom
Maring's baby tomato plants.</LD>
<LD>   Irrigation water snaked across the field, giving the transplants
their first drink of the season. The overflow spilled into a drainage
ditch and then on to the San Joaquin River a few miles away.</LD>
<LD>   The watering started in early May and will be repeated every week
or so until the mid-September harvest.</LD>
<TE>   As the irrigation runoff leaves the brown clay fields of the
valley's west side, it will carry the residue of the herbicides and
pesticides Maring sprays on his tomato plants to ward off weeds, bugs
and fungus. Ultimately, the chemicals will wind up in the chocolate
brown waters of the San Joaquin.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the river is contaminated with pesticides, as are hundreds
of miles of streams, sloughs and drainage canals in the Central
Valley's intricate plumbing system. Beyond, the chemicals foul parts
of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.</TE>
<TE>   The government has long looked the other way--or didn't look at
all. Preoccupied with industrial and municipal polluters, state and
federal laws for decades have exempted agriculture from water
discharge controls. Aside from making sure their topsoil didn't wash
away, most valley farmers haven't had to worry much about what rolled
off their fields.</TE>
<TE>   That is about to change. Some, like Maring, are already starting
to pay heed. Soon, thousands of other farmers may be following his
lead--whether they want to or not.</TE>
<TE>   Pressured by the Legislature, environmental lawsuits and mounting
evidence of pesticide pollution, the state is poised to crack down on
farm runoff, sending clouds of anxiety floating across the valley's 7
million acres of irrigated cropland.</TE>
<TE>   "It just makes you want to pull your hair out," said Paul Wenger,
a ruddy-faced almond grower, pesticide applicator and vice president
of the California Farm Bureau Federation. Wenger worries that runoff
controls will mean more paperwork and higher production costs--"with
nothing out the other side."</TE>
<TE>   California farmers applied 170 million pounds of pesticides to
crops in 2000. More than half of that was used on the fruit and nut
trees and vegetable rows that make the Central Valley one of the
nation's most productive food factories.</TE>
<TE>   When rain pounds the orchards in winter storms, pulses of dormant
season pesticides roll with it into the river systems that feed the
delta. When irrigation water runs off the slow-draining fields of the
valley's west side, the residue of summer sprays goes with it.</TE>
<TE>   Rivers Full of Chemicals</TE>
<TE>   Scientists for the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control
Board have been studying runoff for more than a decade, collecting
and testing water samples. Researchers at the UC Davis aquatic
toxicology lab and the U.S. Geological Survey have conducted similar
surveys.</TE>
<TE>   All have found pesticides. A federal study of the San
Joaquin-Tulare river basins, for instance, reported as many as 22
different pesticides in a single water sample.</TE>
<TE>   Concentrations of the chemicals are potent enough to kill aquatic
life.</TE>
<TE>   The findings prompted the state in 1998 to list hundreds of miles
of Central Valley waterways and parts of the delta as violating clean
water standards.</TE>
<TE>   Included were sections of such rivers as the San Joaquin,
Sacramento, Merced and Stanislaus, as well as the sloughs and drains
that are the workhorses of the valley's elaborate water grid. Late
last year, the regional water board staff recommended declaring eight
more pesticide-laden bodies of water in violation of clean water
standards.</TE>
<TE>   The problem extends beyond the boundaries of the huge Central
Valley. "Almost any agricultural watershed we go into, we see the
same thing," said Victor de Vlaming, director of the UC Davis aquatic
lab.</TE>
<TE>   Two parallel currents are forcing action on the issue. When a
waterway is listed as polluted, the Clean Water Act demands
contaminants be reduced until water quality standards are met.
Additionally, legislation passed in 1999 ended agriculture's
exemption from the state's clean water law as of January 2003.
Regional water quality boards could, in theory, renew the waiver, but
environmental litigation and the pollution listing make it highly
unlikely that a wholesale exemption from clean water standards will
continue.</TE>
<TE>   "[Agriculture is] being dragged kicking and screaming under the
regulatory umbrella," said Bill Jennings, whose Santa Claus-like
appearance and folksy Tennessee accent belie the intensity with which
his group, DeltaKeeper, has hammered the state to end the farm
exemption. "They're not happy about it. But I think the writing is on
the wall. Essentially, they're being asked to do the same things as
municipalities, business and industry. They're not being asked
anything special."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, a key researcher at the Central Valley water board said
that if industry put into the state's waters what farmers are, it
would be ordered to stop. "It's a double standard," said Chris Foe,
senior staff scientist at the board.</TE>
<TE>   Surface Water Polluted</TE>
<TE>   Pesticide pollution is hardly new--DDT contamination still lingers
across the country decades after that insecticide was banned.
Municipal drinking water wells up and down the Central Valley were
contaminated by the soil fumigant DBCP before it was outlawed in the
1970s. And California rice farmers were forced to treat their field
drainage after problems with herbicides in Sacramento Valley
waterways arose in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   But it is only in the last decade that evidence has emerged of
more widespread surface water problems tied to pesticides.</TE>
<TE>   As testing technology advances, scientists have been able to
detect chemicals at lower concentrations. Government agencies are
also taking a broader look at water quality, finding toxic levels of
pesticides in both rural and urban surface waters.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last decade or so, pesticides have been popping up," said
Kathleen Goforth, a scientist in the water division of the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency's regional office. "It's a
combination of people never looking before and improved science."</TE>
<TE>   Water quality officials say they do not know what form a cleanup
program will take. But it is likely the state will develop a system
in which agriculture can continue to release irrigation and storm
runoff while reducing contaminant loads. Steps might include water
monitoring, timing of pesticide applications to avoid rain or
irrigation cycles and construction of holding basins to trap the
first flush of storm runoff, which is typically the most polluted.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of this stuff is really up in the air," said Rudy Schnagl,
chief of the agriculture unit for the Central Valley water board.</TE>
<TE>   Agriculture is not exactly welcoming the scrutiny, which comes as
the state is also preparing to bring Central Valley farmers under air
pollution regulations they have long avoided.</TE>
<TE>   De Vlaming says his UC Davis lab, which performs work for state
regulatory agencies, has been accused by farmers of embarking on a
pesticide witch hunt. Farming associations have criticized the
toxicity testing methods and insisted that more water monitoring is
needed. They argue that pesticide loads in Central Valley waters
haven't been shown to kill anything more than water fleas--one of the
organisms commonly used in the laboratory toxicity tests.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers also say their pesticide practices are constantly evolving
and that if changes need to be made, they should be allowed to make
them without more government regulation. "Everybody is trying to do
the right thing," said Wenger, who grows almonds and walnuts outside
Modesto, where his family has farmed for nearly a century.</TE>
<TE>   "We farm differently today than we did 20 years ago, 10 years
ago," he added. "Are the amount [of pesticides] they're finding in
waterways something that has been there for years and years? We're
cleaning up our act."</TE>
<TE>   Effects on Wildlife</TE>
<TE>   Researchers acknowledge that it's difficult to assess the impact
of pesticide contamination on the broader range of organisms and
wildlife found in Central Valley waters. But they say dead water
fleas are like dead canaries in a mine shaft, a sign of trouble. "If
you kill off water fleas, what are the fish going to eat? Everything
is connected," said the EPA's Goforth.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists also point out that little is known about what happens
when a cocktail of pesticides is mixed together in field runoff. "We
need to be very concerned about delayed effects we don't see," said
De Vlaming.</TE>
<TE>   "There are articles in the literature showing the interaction of
pesticides--with one another or other substances--that make them a
lot more toxic."</TE>
<TE>   Although some pesticide-laced waters are used for human
consumption--delta waters supply more than 20 million
people--regulators say they know of no public health problems in the
state stemming from pesticides in surface water.</TE>
<TE>   Trouble in the 1980s with herbicides in Sacramento's water source
led to improvements that could offer a model of sorts for the rest of
the Central Valley's contamination problems. The herbicides, carried
into the Sacramento River from the area's extensive rice fields,
caused fish kills in drainage channels and left a metallic taste in
river water.</TE>
<TE>   The city sued the state, which then began requiring rice growers
to hold water on their fields before releasing it. That allowed
herbicide chemicals time to break down.</TE>
<TE>   The rice industry, at first petrified at the requirements, now
brags about the results, despite the price tag of about $25 million
over 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   "The rice growers are pretty proud now," said Kati Buehler of the
California Rice Commission. "They have a system that allows us to
farm healthy rice and a system to keep pesticide residues out of
water."</TE>
<TE>   No Quick Fix for Valley</TE>
<TE>   What works in the rice fields may not work in the orchards and
vegetable rows. "It's not just a simple, one solution here," said Art
Baggett, chairman of the State Water Resources Control Board. "We're
talking about millions of acres of land with a very complex water
system."</TE>
<TE>   Maring is already looking for the answer in his fields.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of a grant from his local water district, he and a
couple of neighbors are installing a system to capture some of the
irrigation runoff from their sun-drenched cropland and pump it for
reuse, rather than sending it off to the San Joaquin River.</TE>
<TE>   "The progressive growers don't have their heads in the sand,"
Maring said. "They know this is coming."</TE>

appeared to satisfy both liberals and conservatives.</LD>
<LD>   More than 550 delegates from the 2.5 million-member Presbyterian
Church (U.S.A.) are gathered in Columbus through today for the
denomination's 214th annual general assembly meeting.</LD>
<LD>   Delegates endorsed an eight-page document, "Hope in the Lord Jesus
Christ," on a 497-11 vote. The statement was drafted by the church's
theology and worship office in September after a divisive battle over
salvation and Jesus Christ at last year's convention in Louisville,
Ky.</LD>
<TE>   "Jesus Christ is the only Savior and Lord, and all people
everywhere are called to place their faith, hope and love in him. No
one is saved by virtue of inherent goodness or admirable living," the
document says.</TE>
<TE>   But, in an indirect reference to non-Christians, the document also
says: "We neither restrict the grace of God to those who profess
explicit faith in Christ nor assume that all people are saved
regardless of faith. Grace, love and communion belong to God, and are
not ours to determine."</TE>
<TE>   Conservatives were dissatisfied after last year's meeting, leading
to the growth of the insurgent Confessing Church Movement. More than
1,200 congregations have joined the movement by affirming, among
other things, salvation through Jesus Christ alone.</TE>
<TE>   The new statement garnered support from both the left and the
right, in part because it leaves some theological wiggle room on the
direct questions of salvation that have caused friction in the
diverse church.</TE>
<TE>   "It says modestly the things we need to say modestly, and it says
clearly the things we need to say clearly," said the Rev. Anna
Case-Winters, a theologian at McCormick Seminary in Chicago, who
chaired the meeting's confessions and Christology committee.</TE>
<TE>   Theology had become the newest area of contention in the
denomination, after years of back-and-forth battles over human
sexuality. Delegates to last year's meeting, sensing the discord,
appointed a panel to examine doctrinal divisions and report back in
2005.</TE>
<TE>   Case-Winters said the church is suffering from battle fatigue and
that this year's civil debate showed "we're moving to a different
place."</TE>
<TE>   "It's important for us to say together what we can say together,
and for those things that we cannot say together, to keep talking,"
she said after the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Delegates declined to formulate a "new Confession of Faith for the
21st century," opting instead to stand by the church's exhaustive
Book of Confessions, a collection of 10 doctrinal statements that was
last updated in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   Delegates also declined to approve an "authoritative
interpretation" of the ordination vow professed by new pastors. The
vow, which will remain intact, asks new pastors, "Do you trust in
Jesus Christ your Savior, acknowledge him Lord of all and head of the
church, and through him believe in one God, Father, Son and Holy
Spirit?"</TE>
<TE>   Conservative leaders said they were satisfied with the new
document. The Rev. Joe Rightmyer, executive director of Presbyterians
for Renewal, said his group gave the document a "hearty endorsement."</TE>
<TE>   "We're even more elated that at this year's general assembly ...
the Christology issue is a matter of an expression of Christian unity
rather than a source of great controversy and debate," he said.</TE>

<HD>Canadian Church Will Keep Its 1613 King James Bible</HD>
<DH>Treasure: A tiny congregation votes not to sell the rare
volume, a second edition with a colorful past.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOUGLAS TODD</AU>
<BD>RELIGION NEWS SERVICE</BD>
<DL>VANCOUVER, Canada</DL>
<LD>After a long and passionate debate, members of a remote church in the
Canadian Rockies have voted to keep a rare, 4-century-old King James
Bible that one congregant calls a "spiritual legacy."</LD>
<LD>   For almost a year, controversy had stirred among church members
and others over whether to keep the Bible, donate it to a university
or sell it for cash to help the poor.</LD>
<LD>   "It's been a contentious issue for some time," said Art Keith,
describing how members of the joint Anglican-United (Church of
Canada) congregation in Invermere, British Columbia, and people from
across the country, aired their views.</LD>
<TE>   Keith headed the panel that decided to poll the congregation's
roughly 125 members to decide what to do with the large book, often
called the Dort Bible after the Dutch city where it found a home
during the 1700s.</TE>
<TE>   It had been taken there by an English clergyman fleeing a
religious crackdown by British ruler Oliver Cromwell.</TE>
<TE>   On June 9, two-thirds of the members decided the Bible should
remain in Invermere, 500 miles northeast of Vancouver, as part of its
heritage and be displayed in the church.</TE>
<TE>   The others said the Bible, valued by antiquarians at $30,000 to
$100,000 in U.S. money, should be given to a scholarly institution or
auctioned to expand the church's ministry.</TE>
<TE>   "The good news is that it's no longer going to be stuffed in a box
anymore," said the Rev. Michael Rice, pastor of Christ Church
Trinity, after the vote. Currently it is kept in a vault.</TE>
<TE>   ship.</TE>
<TE>   It survived Cromwell, an escape to Holland, a church demolition,
an Atlantic voyage, absent-minded church custodians and a close call
with a fire.</TE>
<TE>   The book was published in 1613, which makes it a second-edition
authorized King James Bible, named after Britain's King James I, who
authorized 50 scholars to produce what turned into the world's most
famous Bible translation.</TE>

<HD>Oxnard Mini-City Project Advances</HD>
<DH>Growth: The development is the largest in Ventura County
history. Planners' OK of an environmental study is subject to council
review.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELENA GAONA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite concerns over increased traffic, the Oxnard Planning
Commission has approved the environmental report on the largest
residential and commercial project in Ventura County history.</LD>
<LD>   The commission Thursday unanimously endorsed the study on the
$750-million RiverPark mini-city. The City Council is scheduled to
consider the report July 16.</LD>
<LD>   The development plan includes about 2,800 dwellings, a town
square, movie theater and restaurants, a first-class hotel,
convention center, three schools and sports fields. The project would
be built at the Ventura Freeway and Pacific Coast Highway junction
and generate about 79,000 vehicle trips.</LD>
<TE>   Commissioner Albert Duff questioned why Oxnard Boulevard, which is
also Pacific Coast Highway in that area, could not be extended
farther north into the project site to ease traffic congestion that
would affect neighboring El Rio. Vineyard Avenue borders the project
site on the east and would absorb much of the traffic.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to cause a lot of traffic and they're not building
enough roadways to accommodate this development," Duff said. "There
will be congestion at the expense of the people who already live
there and that's not fair."</TE>
<TE>   Commission staff members said extending Oxnard Boulevard would be
costly and not significantly ease traffic. They said a new roadway in
that area could also reduce ground-water supplies because it would
require filling a gravel pit used for water storage and recharging
aquifers.</TE>
<TE>   Iris Yang, a Sacramento attorney hired by the city of Ventura for
consulting on RiverPark, also raised concerns about increased
spillover traffic in Ventura. She said the environmental study only
identified eight intersections that would be affected in Ventura,
while the city's own studies indicate dozens would be clogged.</TE>
<TE>   "To mitigate the impacts on county and Oxnard roads, the developer
is spending $17.7 million," Yang said. "We're just on the other side
of the river and the only mitigation that was proposed was the
restriping of Johnson Drive. That doesn't seem quite right."</TE>
<TE>   Yang said Ventura is negotiating with the developers to either pay
for roadway improvements or fix the roads. Also Thursday, affordable
housing advocates questioned whether the development would provide
enough housing for working families employed at the project's hotels,
restaurants and shops. RiverPark calls for setting aside 15% of the
project for low- and very low-income households.</TE>
<TE>   "In this instance, given the types [and number] of jobs created,
we'd like to ask for perhaps as high as 20%," said Eileen McCarthy of
California Rural Legal Assistance in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents also raised concerns over the proposed sites for
three schools the developer has agreed to build for about $47
million.</TE>
<TE>   But one of the development's partners said Rio Elementary School
District officials were included in the selection of sites.</TE>
<TE>   "We have taken the whole issue of funding, design and construction
of the schools very seriously," said developer Paul N. Keller, a
RiverPark partner. He said the schools would be constructed in phases
as the project is built out.</TE>
<TE>   Developers hope to break ground on the massive project this year
and open the first of five phases for occupancy by early 2004, after
construction of a new freeway interchange and the widening of the
adjacent Santa Clara River Bridge--a $100-million project that got
underway this month.</TE>
<TE>   After Thursday's hearing, Keller said he was encouraged by the
commission's endorsement.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very pleased," he said, "and we look forward to ultimate
approval of the development."</TE>

<HD>Sauna Closings Anger Fitness Buffs</HD>
<DH>Fitness: Members protest the YMCA's plan to close steam
rooms citywide. Health risks cited.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles fitness buffs were steaming Friday over the sudden
shutdown of saunas at workout centers operated by the YMCA of
Metropolitan Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   All saunas and steam rooms were ordered permanently shuttered
Tuesday by YMCA officials. The closure followed a June 4 fire that
authorities say began in a sauna and caused $1 million in damage to
the Westchester YMCA.</LD>
<LD>   But YMCA administrators claim that heath issues--not fire-safety
concerns--prompted the closure order.</LD>
<TE>   "For some time now, we have had serious concerns about the health
risks," said Larry M. Rosen, president of Los Angeles YMCAs.
"Furthermore, YMCAs are aware of no credible support in the realms of
science or health for the use of saunas and steam rooms."</TE>
<TE>   That explanation was raising the stress levels of YMCA members who
say they enjoyed the calming and cleansing effect of relaxing in
superheated saunas after a workout or a hard day of work.</TE>
<TE>   Those who use saunas and steam rooms contend that a short stint in
the 104-degree heat relaxes muscles, increases energy, improves skin
tone and even enhances memory and concentration.</TE>
<TE>   They are not recommended for pregnant women or those with high
blood pressure or heart disease, however. And YMCA officials said
there is no way to ensure the guidelines are followed.</TE>
<TE>   "From my standpoint, it's both a stretching heat applied to tired
muscles and a cleansing of impurities through sweating," said sauna
and steam room user Nick Press, an investment banker from Glendale
who is a member of the Ketchum-Downtown YMCA, which is near his Los
Angeles high-rise office.</TE>
<TE>   "People are grumbling that they are just using the fire as an
excuse to close these. They haven't spent money keeping them up. You
get the feeling they were just looking for a way to shut it down."</TE>
<TE>   Some YMCA members say they were told that the saunas and steam
rooms are considered a liability in the post-Sept. 11 climate where
insurance costs have gone up.</TE>
<TE>   Others worry that commercial fitness centers, which sometimes look
to the YMCA as a trend-setter as well as competitor, might also begin
shutting steam rooms.</TE>
<TE>   YMCA officials said Friday that while insurance costs have
increased, that was not an issue in the shutdown. The Westchester
fire, which closed the branch indefinitely, was apparently caused
when an outside cleaning crew left a floor mat on a sauna heating
element, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to lose a lot of members and goodwill, but this is
something we had to do," Rosen said. Saunas will be closed at YMCAs
in Hollywood, the Westside, Downey, Torrance, South-Central and San
Pedro as well as downtown and Westchester, he said. "We're concerned
about the health hazards these represent."</TE>
<TE>   Feeling the heat, officials are urging YMCA staff members to
"avoid wading into a debate" with angry sauna supporters, as J.C.
Holt Jr., executive director of the Ketchum-Downtown YMCA, put it. He
said the Y was prepared to refund membership fees to disgruntled
members and "take any necessary fiscal step to weather any outcome."</TE>
<TE>   But in terms of a long-term backlash, Holt indicated he isn't
sweating it.</TE>
<TE>   "Traditionally, issues of this nature will remain active for about
30 days ... about the length of time I have on the books for
vacation," he joked in a memo to staff members.</TE>

<LD>This cash-strapped city is mulling a plan to bill a property owner's
insurance company $2,500 for every house or business fire
extinguished by the Fire Department.</LD>
<LD>   Insurance officials warn that the fee probably would lead to
higher insurance premiums, and may well be illegal in California.</LD>
<LD>   City officials said the fee is designed to take advantage of
existing insurance policies, and is a small price to pay compared
with the losses that firefighters prevent.</LD>
<TE>   The city's $32-million budget for 2002-03 includes $30,000 in
estimated income from the fee.</TE>

<LD>A sick sea lion was recuperating Friday after it wandered across the
runway at San Francisco International Airport, prompting airport
officials to consider fencing off miles of the bay front. The runways
jut into San Francisco Bay.</LD>
<LD>   Because the sea lion was discovered about 4 a.m., it did not
interfere with passenger flights, an airport spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   But the disoriented animal did startle airport workers Tuesday
after it ended up in the American Airlines cargo area.</LD>
<TE>   The 6-foot-long sea lion appears to have been poisoned by domoic
acid, a naturally occurring toxin produced by algae.</TE>

<HD>Max Schneier, 85; Staunch Advocate for the Mentally Ill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Max Schneier, whose daughter's mental problems turned him into an
internationally known advocate for improved treatment and prompted
him to create innovative halfway house programs in New York and Los
Angeles, has died. He was 85.</LD>
<LD>   Schneier, who spent several years in semi-retirement in Southern
California, died of natural causes Monday in Lauderhill, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   A dress manufacturer in New York's garment district, he became
concerned about and involved in mental health treatment in 1969. His
youngest daughter, Denise, had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder
during her freshman year in college, and was about to be discharged
from a mental hospital with no place to go and no public help
available.</LD>
<TE>   He organized patients' parents into a powerful lobbying group to
demand more money for public facilities to treat the mentally ill. In
1972, he smuggled a young ABC reporter named Geraldo Rivera into New
York's Willowbrook State School for the Retarded to expose conditions
there, forcing the facility's closure and focusing national attention
on problems permeating the mental health system.</TE>
<TE>   Turning his garment business over to a son in order to become a
full-time mental health advocate, Schneier helped found the National
Alliance for the Mentally Ill in 1979, and created his own
Transitional Living Centers--halfway houses for ex-hospital patients
returning to the community--in Hawthorne and the New York borough of
Queens.</TE>
<TE>   The Southern California facility, which won a state Supreme Court
ruling rejecting neighbors' objections to its presence, initially
supervised about 70 young adults diagnosed with chronic
schizophrenia. The "clients" lived in private South Bay homes and
apartments supervised by Schneier's counselors, and attended daily
classes and workshops designed to help them relearn the basic skills
of daily living--from dressing and talking to others to using the
public bus system--and perhaps become employable.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when California and other states were vastly reducing
the numbers of hospitalized mental patients in favor of
community-based treatment, Schneier's program answered a crying need
and won general praise from authorities. Others criticized Schneier
for failing to meet his original estimates of patient job placements,
which he had predicted would be "even better" than the 52% achieved
in his Queens operation.</TE>
<TE>   After three years of running his Southland center here, Schneier
told The Times in 1982: "The mistake people make is that somehow they
get the idea that most of these people can be restored to competitive
employment. The legitimate end and purpose is to help these people
lead happier lives. We'd be lucky to get 7% or 8% restored to
competitive employment."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Kenneth Parker, in a statement on behalf of the board of
Transitional Living Centers of Los Angeles County, said Schneier "was
a pioneer, a tireless crusader and preeminent advocate on behalf of
the chronic mentally ill.... He founded programs ... based on what
has come to be known and widely accepted as the psychosocial
rehabilitation model. His programs were the forerunners for the best
that the public mental health system offers today. His boundless
energy was an inspiration to an entire generation of clients,
parents, advocates and providers."</TE>
<TE>   While Schneier was living in the Los Angeles area, he earned a law
degree in his late 60s at the University of West Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The volunteer crusader received numerous awards for his dedicated
efforts, including the Irving Blumberg Human Rights Award from a unit
of the United Nations' World Health Organization in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Leonard Rubenstein, director of the Bazelon Center
for Mental Health Law in Washington, D.C., told an interviewer: "Max
is a gift. He has a wonderful way of latching onto an important issue
that no one else has found and forcing everyone, through his
persistence, to pay attention to it."</TE>
<TE>   The international award was presented shortly after Schneier's
second wife, Suzanne, who worked with him in his cause despite her
own mental health problems, committed suicide. Schneier was so upset
by her death that he considered abandoning his work, but rallied and
remained a staunch advocate for the mentally ill until his own death.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration established an annual employee award and an internship
in Schneier's honor, hailing him as "a leading advocate of quality
rehabilitative services in the area of mental health, especially for
those dually diagnosed with mental and substance abuse disorders."
Schneier served on the agency's national advisory council for four
years and was a member of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Health Care Organizations. He fought for high standards in private
psychiatric hospitals and greater representation of consumers' and
patients' families on accrediting committees.</TE>
<TE>   Twice widowed, Schneier is survived by four children from his
first marriage, Deborah Bassman of Hollywood, Fla.; Denise
Schneier-Coke of Baltimore; David of Odessa, Ukraine; and Jeffrey of
Lancaster, Pa.; a brother, Dr. Monroe Schneier of Pennsylvania; 10
grandchildren; and nine great- grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   The family has asked that any memorial donations be sent to the
Max and Suzanne Schneier Memorial Trust Fund of the Broward Alliance
for the Mentally Ill Inc., 6193 Rock Island Road, No. 313, Tamarac,
FL 33319.</TE>

<HD>Developer Pledges Funds for New School</HD>
<DH>Education: The offer comes as welcome news to the Oxnard
elementary district, which has been unable to keep up with growth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIN GRENNAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The company behind the proposed Seabridge neighborhood has agreed to
provide up to $15 million to build a new grade school.</LD>
<LD>   "It is, for us, very extraordinary," said Oxnard Elementary School
District Supt. Richard Duarte.</LD>
<LD>   The district has been on a year-round, multitrack system for more
than 20 years to accommodate the maximum number of students possible,
but has not been able to build schools quickly enough to keep up with
recent growth, he said.</LD>
<TE>   There are few places left to build schools in Oxnard considering
that land in the coastal zone, in SOAR-protected areas and
surrounding Oxnard Airport is off-limits.</TE>
<TE>   In a deal announced Thursday, Mandalay Bay Partners agreed to pay
more than half of the approximate $27-million cost of buying land,
planning and building a school, said Bill Wynne one of the developers
of the 700-home subdivision.</TE>
<TE>   The school district hopes to receive matching funds from a state
bond measure on the Nov. 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Assuming the bond passes and the district receives a share, the
partnership--whose parent company built Rancho Santa Margarita in
Orange County--will pay the bulk of the remaining costs, up to $15
million, Wynne said.</TE>
<TE>   If the district does not receive the bond money, district lawyer
Marilyn Cleveland said the two sides will have to come up with a new
cost-sharing plan.</TE>
<TE>   By law, the 135-acre Seabridge project, located west of Victoria
Avenue near Wooley Road in the Mandalay Bay area, is required to pay
only about $4 million to the school district, Wynne said. Duarte said
most developers are only willing to pay the minimum required.</TE>
<TE>   While significant for the elementary school district, the
agreement doesn't quite compare to the one reached between the
developer of the $750-million RiverPark community and the Rio
Elementary School District earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   RiverPark backers agreed to donate the land and spend $47 million
to build and equip three schools, with or without the assistance of
state bond money.</TE>
<TE>   The Oxnard Elementary School District has worked with the
developers of the $100-million Seabridge project for three years,
Duarte said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to a desire to "do the right thing," Wynne said
providing substantial support for a new school would benefit his
company.</TE>
<TE>   With overcrowding such a concern in Oxnard, the addition of a new
school would be a selling point to prospective buyers, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wynne said the city and the school district made it clear from the
start that providing a school was a top priority.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing the city's concerns helped the company move through the
approval process relatively quickly at a time when the land available
for development is rapidly diminishing, he said.</TE>

<HD>Student Group Sanctioned for Clash During Protest</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Campus officials put Palestinian organization on
probation and halt funding. A Jewish group is warned after the
confrontation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Francisco State announced Friday that it placed a Palestinian
student organization on probation and cut off its funding for one
year because of a campus confrontation last month.</LD>
<LD>   The university also issued a letter of warning to a Jewish student
group whose pro-Israel peace rally ended in the clash with
pro-Palestinian demonstrators.</LD>
<LD>   Along with those disciplinary steps, the university announced
initiatives to promote civil discourse on campus.</LD>
<TE>   They include a three-day retreat for student organization leaders,
including heads of the two groups, and presentations for other
students and faculty.</TE>
<TE>   "We are using all our resources as a university to make the recent
tensions, which echo so painfully the whole Middle East situation, an
occasion for learning and growth," university President Robert A.
Corrigan said in a news release. "We believe firmly that the skills
and habits of open, yet civil, dissent can be modeled and taught. I
can think of no more critical work for us to do."</TE>
<TE>   No injuries were reported in the May 7 confrontation, but police
were called to escort participants in the pro-Israel rally to safety
after they came face to face with counterdemonstrators.</TE>
<TE>   The university said that it disciplined the General Union of
Palestine Students because its members interfered with the pro-Israel
rally.</TE>
<TE>   After reviewing videotapes and interviewing witnesses about the
incident, campus authorities concluded that the counterdemonstrators
had violated campus regulations by hurling racial and ethnic
epithets, using bullhorns and drums and refusing to remain in their
designated area.</TE>
<TE>   University spokeswoman Ligeia Polidora said school authorities
also took down the group's Web site earlier this week because it
showed an animated image throwing a rock against the Star of David
and because the site carried a link to a separate Web site that made
claims of "Jewish ritual murder."</TE>
<TE>   Polidora said the warning letter was issued to the Jewish student
group Hillel because members also shouted racial and ethnic epithets
and hung flags on the student center without permission and because
one member used a bullhorn.</TE>
<TE>   The university said disciplinary proceedings are pending against
three students, but would not identify their affiliations.</TE>
<TE>   The San Francisco district attorney's office has been reviewing
the events, but no charges have been filed.</TE>
<TE>   Nabeel Silmi, a San Francisco State junior serving as spokesman
for the General Union of Palestine Students, called the sanctions
against his group unfair.</TE>
<TE>   "Things were said on both sides. However, the whole GUPS [being
held] responsible for everybody's comments on May 7 is completely
unacceptable. We have sanctions put on us now, but we are going to
continue to work with the administration, let them know what our
opinion is, and where we stand. On an organizational level, we didn't
do anything wrong," Silmi said.</TE>
<TE>   Orli Bein, graduate program coordinator for San Francisco Hillel,
said the university "has taken some important steps" to improve the
atmosphere on campus.</TE>
<TE>   But she said the warning letter campus officials sent to Hillel
was inappropriate because of "the extreme care we've taken to abide
by the rules."</TE>
<TE>   Bein called the letter a misguided "effort to criticize both sides
to seem impartial."</TE>

<HD>Tribes Granted More Slot Licenses</HD>
<DH>Gambling: Casinos may now operate up to 51,300 machines,
even as confusion over state regulations reigns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTINA BOXALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state Gambling Control Commission this week authorized another
2,753 slot machines at Indian casinos, while leaving unresolved a
highly contentious debate over the number of gaming devices permitted
under state law.</LD>
<LD>   Ever since a torturously worded gaming compact was signed between
the state and California tribes, there has been wide disagreement
over the maximum number of slot machines allowed by the measure. Gov.
Gray Davis' office has given a figure of 45,000, the state
legislative analyst's office said 113,000, and some tribes have
argued for still more.</LD>
<LD>   Since gambling profits are at stake, the arguments are intense and
tediously detailed. About the only thing universally conceded is that
the compact's language will keep attorneys busy.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a real quagmire," said gambling commission Chairman John
Hensley. "It's a document free for interpretation and has many
conflicts."</TE>
<TE>   Consider the wording of section 4.3.2.2 (a)(1): "The maximum
number of machines that all compact tribes in the aggregate may
license pursuant to this section shall be a sum equal to 350
multiplied by the number of non-compact tribes as of Sept. 1, 1999,
plus the difference between 350 and the lesser number authorized
under Section 4.3.1."</TE>
<TE>   A recent commission staff report termed the section "sufficiently
obscure" that it will probably take renegotiation of the
compacts--scheduled for next March--to clear up the confusion.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Hensley said, "There are so many arguments out
there we felt we have to go where we felt the safest."</TE>
<TE>   Meeting in Los Angeles, the commission decided it could issue
another 2,753 slot licenses to Indian casinos.</TE>
<TE>   That will bring to about 51,300 the number of tribal slot licenses
available--although not all licenses have been used. Of the 62 tribes
that have a gaming compact with the state, 46 are actually operating
casinos, with a total of about 41,000 slot machines.</TE>
<TE>   Gaming on tribal lands has long been stuck in a legal thicket.</TE>
<TE>   The state Supreme Court voided a 1998 measure allowing gambling on
tribal land, concluding it violated a state constitutional provision
barring Nevada-style gambling in California.</TE>
<TE>   That ruling in 1999 prompted Davis to negotiate a deal with tribes
placing Proposition 1A on the March 2000 ballot. There was little
opposition to the initiative, which the tribes spent more than $21
million promoting. It passed by a hefty margin, amending the state
Constitution to allow tribes to run Nevada-style casinos on
reservations.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to disputes over the maximum number of slots
permitted, there is disagreement over whether the state even has the
right to issue the licenses.</TE>
<TE>   "The commission has no authority under ... tribal-state compacts
to assume control over the allocation and issuance of gaming device
licenses," Bernard Simons, an attorney for the Aqua Caliente tribe,
wrote to the commission last week.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Friday, Hensley emphasized the need to untangle
the gaming compact. "This language should really be clarified as soon

<TE>   Tribal attorney Howard Dickstein of Sacramento said he was
encouraged by the commission's action. "This is a show of good faith
and of independence from the governor. Those are good signs."</TE>

<HD>Council OKs Measures to Help Lure NFL Team to Los Angeles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although private investors have backed out of building a downtown
football stadium, the Los Angeles City Council approved several
measures Friday aimed at luring the NFL back to town.</LD>
<LD>   The council voted 9 to 1 to establish an ad hoc committee of
council members and a working group of city agency staff members to
evaluate stadium proposals.</LD>
<LD>   The Community Redevelopment Agency was ordered to scour the 36
blighted areas it is revitalizing throughout the city for potential
stadium sites, and to assess the benefits and impacts of a new
stadium.</LD>
<TE>   The moves come a week after Anschutz Entertainment Group President
Tim Leiweke announced that he and his partners were abandoning plans
to build a 64,000-seat, $450-million stadium in South Park. Many of
the motions approved Friday were prompted by that proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't the first time the NFL has been discussed around this
horseshoe," said council President Alex Padilla, who will chair the
ad hoc committee. "And it's not going to be the last."</TE>
<TE>   The committee will provide a public venue where such matters can
be thoroughly analyzed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Jack Weiss was the lone dissenter. He said the
proposals were a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we should set the wheels of government in motion at
all to help the NFL pick our pockets," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's face it: That's what the NFL is good at. They're good at
bleeding cities dry.</TE>
<TE>   "The NFL ought to come to Los Angeles and explain to us why it is
worth our while to have a football team here," Weiss said.</TE>

<HD>Man Accused of Taunting Police in Graffiti Is Held</HD>
<DH>Crime: The suspect is charged with 30 counts of late-night
vandalism in Sylmar over seven months. The damage has been put at
$42,000.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A cat-and-mouse game in which a graffiti vandal taunted police has
ended with the arrest of a 21-year-old Sylmar man, Los Angeles police
announced at a news conference on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   For about seven months, Sylmar residents have complained about a
late-night vandal who spray-painted his name, explicit messages and
caricatures on buildings, vehicles and freeway signs in the area.
Dubbing himself "This One," he caused $42,000 in damage, Los Angeles
Police Department officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Gary Long, a UPS worker arrested on June 12, defaced walls and
buildings "simply for the adrenaline rush," said Officer Kelly Mahon
of the Foothill Division's Tagger Task Force.</LD>
<TE>   "Graffiti in our communities is an eyesore and encourages acts of
lawlessness, so it must be stopped," said LAPD Cmdr. Michel Moore,
who praised Foothill officers for their work in Long's arrest. "The
excessiveness of this graffiti spree was deplorable."</TE>
<TE>   In a search of Long's home earlier this month, police said they
found dozens of spray-paint cans, marijuana paraphernalia and "piece
books," which are photo albums filled with pictures of a tagger's
best artwork.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted us to be a part of his game," Mahon said. "Well, we
played his game and he lost."</TE>
<TE>   According to police, some of Long's messages read, "Where you at,
vandal squad" and "I know who you are and I know where you live,
cease or be deceased."</TE>
<TE>   Long also allegedly left a message across the street from a
baseball field that encouraged children to take drugs, have wild sex
and kill their parents.</TE>
<TE>   To intimidate someone he suspected of talking to police, Long
allegedly left a graffiti message on the tailgate of the person's
pickup truck calling the person a traitor.</TE>
<TE>   Long, who is being held on $75,000 bail at the Pitchess Detention
Center in Castaic, is due in San Fernando Superior Court on Wednesday
for a preliminary hearing. He pleaded not guilty last week to 28
felony and two misdemeanor counts of vandalism, said Jane Robison, a
spokeswoman for the district attorney's office. He could face eight
years in prison if convicted.</TE>

<HD>Terror Funding Charges Rejected</HD>
<DH>Money: Judge rules U.S. method of finding that members back
violence against Iranian regime is unconstitutional. No other cases
will be immediately affected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON and DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge Friday dismissed an indictment against seven people
accused of raising money in Los Angeles for an Iranian opposition
group, ruling that the State Department's procedure for classifying
the group as a terrorist organization was unconstitutional.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors charged that the seven defendants--five Iranians and
two Iranian Americans-- were members of a cell of Moujahedeen Khalq,
also known as MEK, which is seeking to overthrow the current Iranian
government.</LD>
<LD>   In his 19-page ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Robert M.
Takasugi found that the process by which the State Department
designates groups such as MEK as terrorist organizations deprives
them of their constitutional due process rights. That, the judge
said, is in part because the groups are not allowed to challenge the
evidence against them before they are declared terrorist
organizations.</LD>
<TE>   "National security is certainly a matter of grave concern and
responsibility," Takasugi wrote. But, "the argument for national
security should not serve as an excuse for obliterating the
Constitution."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles had no immediate comment
on the ruling. But spokesman Thom Mrozek said the government was
reviewing its options, including a possible appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Steingard, an attorney for one of the defendants, hailed
the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "We have never understood why the government was prosecuting the
one group of people willing to stand up to the present regime in
Iran, which the president of the United States has described as part
of the 'axis of evil,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   Takasugi's ruling has no immediate impact on any other cases of
this kind. However, if the government appeals the decision to the
U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and loses, it would immediately
affect federal courts in many Western states.</TE>
<TE>   The defendants were accused of raising more than $1 million at Los
Angeles International Airport and funneling the money to the MEK.</TE>
<TE>   Although the U.S. State Department declared MEK a terrorist
organization in 1997, the group has attracted wide support among both
Democrats and Republicans in Congress. More than 220 members both
Houses signed a petition asking the State Department to drop the MEK
from its terrorist list.</TE>
<TE>   The MEK began in the 1960s, one of many groups opposing the shah
of Iran. But after the shah's downfall in 1979, it ran afoul of the
Islamist regime and went into exile. Outlawed in Iran, the group is
now based in Iraq, where it stages cross-border raids on Iran,
according to the U.S. State Department's biennial terrorist report.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles charged that the defendants
solicited money from Asian travelers, , saying they were from the
Committee for Human Rights in Iran, which authorities said was a
front for MEK. The government suspected some of the money could have
been used to buy arms abroad.</TE>
<TE>   MEK was classified as a terrorist organization following the
government's standard procedures: the State Department formally
determined that the foreign-based organization engaged in terrorism
that could threaten U.S. security.</TE>
<TE>   The way the process works, the State Department is required to
notify high-ranking members of Congress and provide
evidence--sometimes classified--that the group is engaged in
terrorist activity. Seven days after that, a notice designating the
group as a foreign terrorist organization is published in the Federal
Register. he group's assets may then be frozen and individuals may be
prosecuted for raising money for the group.</TE>
<TE>   The group in question is not informed that it is under suspicion
before publication in the Federal Register. Group members are also
not allowed to see any classified evidence against them.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the U.S. Circuit Court in Washington, D.C., found that
the MEK was denied its constitutional due process rights. But instead
of striking down the terrorist designation, the court created a
process by which the State Department could correct any due process
problem.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Takasugi said he disagreed with that court.</TE>
<TE>   "I will not ... allow this criminal case to proceed if the
evidence indicates that [the foreign terrorist designation] was
procured in violation of the Constitution."</TE>
<TE>   But one federal law enforcement source said, "I don't know how
anyone wouldn't think this is a big disappointment after all the time
spent on this case. Especially with all the terrorism stuff going on,
it's just stunning that this happened."</TE>
<TE>   Indicted were Roya Rahmani, 40; Mustafa Ahmady, 47; Hossein
Afshari, 44; Alireza Mohammadmoradi, 31; Mohammad Omidvar, 45; Navid
Taj, 51; and Hassan Rezaie, 47, all of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   They contended that the money they collected at LAX and through
other solicitations in the Iranian community was intended to help
feed starving Iranian children.</TE>
<TE>   The government alleged that the group raised as much as $10,000 a
day in Los Angeles, depositing more than $1 million into Turkish bank
accounts.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, according to prosecution documents, about $400,000 was
transferred from the Turkish accounts to a used auto parts store in
the United Arab Emirates and then used to buy rocket-propelled
grenades, mortars and other arms. The defendants were also accused of
using high-pressure tactics with foreign travelers at LAX, telling
some that they were "required" to give at least $20 to $50.</TE>

<HD>Defendant's Sex Claim Is Rejected</HD>
<DH>Courts: Jury denies woman's assertion that a judge forced
their relationship during trial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A jury on Friday ruled against a Monrovia woman who claimed she was
coerced into having sexual encounters with a Los Angeles judge
presiding over the criminal trial of her and her husband.</LD>
<LD>   The woman, Pifen Lo, sought up to $20 million from the state of
California for infliction of emotional distress--$1 million for each
time she said she was forced to have sex with former Superior Court
Judge George W. Trammell III. But the Santa Ana jury of six men and
six women concluded that their relationship was consensual.</LD>
<LD>   "They were both being used," juror William Price said. "She had
her reasons for doing this."</LD>
<TE>   Jurors said they were most swayed by audiotapes that both Lo and
Trammell secretly recorded during their encounters. In the tapes,
jurors said, Lo sounded aggressive and appeared to be trying to take
advantage of the judge in an effort to win leniency for herself and
her husband.</TE>
<TE>   While Lo's lawyer characterized the judge as a rapist, jurors said
he came off as more sympathetic and that Lo was frequently heard
laughing during encounters.</TE>
<TE>   "She was not credible," juror Connie Cura said.</TE>
<TE>   Another juror, who did not give her name, added: "He sounded
sweet.... He gave her advice, asked her how she was doing."</TE>
<TE>   The relationship between Lo, 42, and Trammell, 66, began in 1996,
shortly after authorities arrested Lo, her husband and their live-in
baby-sitter on charges of kidnapping a La Puente couple for ransom.
Lo's husband, Ming Ching Jin, faced a potential life sentence in
Trammell's courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   Lo claimed that the judge had called her into his chambers,
fondled and kissed her and told her that if she wanted her husband to
come home early, she would have to "pay the price." Lo claimed she
was forced into a four-month affair.</TE>
<TE>   Lo was sentenced to five years' probation by Trammell, over the
objections of prosecutors who had sought prison time. She pleaded no
contest to charges of child endangerment, counterfeiting and money
laundering.</TE>
<TE>   The relationship was discovered when prison officials intercepted
letters between Lo and her imprisoned husband.</TE>
<TE>   Trammell pleaded guilty Oct. 4, 2000, to federal mail fraud
charges related to his conduct while presiding over the criminal
trial of Lo and her husband.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Court Judge A. Howard Matz found that Trammell had
abused his power as a judge and that Lo was especially vulnerable
because she was a defendant in his courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   Trammell began serving a 27-month prison term last August in
Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Lo sought civil damages against California, which was Trammell's
employer. As the verdict was read Friday, Lo sat rigidly and clutched
a bottle of water. After the trial, she refused to speak with
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   "Pifen Lo is bitterly disappointed in the result of this case,"
said her lawyer, Larry Guzin.</TE>
<TE>   "She was terribly taken advantage of by Judge Trammell and will
feel the effects of his sexuality against her for the rest of her
life."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Hood, the lawyer representing the state, said he believed
jurors would see that Lo intended to use the judge and was not his
victim.</TE>
<TE>   "At least from what you could hear in the tapes, it seemed to be a
very normal relationship," Hood said. "She claimed that the judge's
conduct toward her made her feel like a prostitute."</TE>
<TE>   Lo's suit was tried in Orange County because all Los Angeles
County judges recused themselves,saying they were friends of
Trammell's.</TE>
<TE>   Trammell retired from the bench a day after learning he was under
investigation in 1997.</TE>

<LD>A Burbank man was sentenced this week to a year in jail in connection
with a credit card fraud operation at the Camarillo Premium Outlets,
prosecutors said.</LD>
<LD>   Tigran Petrosyan, 31, pleaded guilty in January to grand theft,
forgery and identity theft.</LD>
<LD>   During his sentencing, Petrosyan also was ordered to pay
restitution and spend three years on probation.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities believe that Petrosyan and co-defendant Gregorin
Babayan, 27, of Reseda used counterfeit credit cards in August and
September to buy $6,172 worth of merchandise at a jewelry store and
$1,933 worth of goods at a clothing store.</TE>
<TE>   Petrosyan also participated in using a counterfeit credit card to
buy $6,963 worth of goods from another retailer at the outlet mall.
Babayan was sentenced in February to 180 days in jail.</TE>

<HD>Salvation on the Horizon for a Century-Old Simi Valley
Chapel</HD>
<DH>Worship: A benefit today will help fund a $215,000
renovation of the city's first church, St. Rose of Lima. 'It's been a
very long wait,' says a historian.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIN GRENNAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Simi Valley's first church is a broken shell of its former self. The
100-year-old clapboard chapel sits in three pieces. Missing are a
wall, bell tower and anything suggesting a spiritual past. No altar,
pews or crucifix--not even a shard of stained glass remains.</LD>
<LD>   But salvation has arrived.</LD>
<LD>   Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District, Simi Valley Historical
Society and the city of Simi Valley have rallied to save the tiny
blue-and-white building. A lawn party will be held today at
Strathearn Historical Park to raise money to help pay for the
$215,000 project.</LD>
<TE>   "It's been a very long wait for this," said Patricia Havens,
museum director and city historian. "Thank heaven we've reached this
point."</TE>
<TE>   The park district bought the chapel in December. The district,
with the Historical Society, paid $55,000 to relocate it from Simi
Valley's oldest neighborhood to Strathearn park two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   City staff members are drawing renovation plans and hope to find
an architectural firm to donate its services.</TE>
<TE>   Memories of the former St. Rose of Lima church fueled a 40-year
drive to save the chapel. People such as Connie Luna, 72, a
Historical Society board member, didn't want to let go.</TE>
<TE>   Luna attended the church from the time her family moved to Simi
Valley in 1935 until a larger St. Rose church was built in 1964. She
sang in the church's choir; her brother was an altar boy.</TE>
<TE>   "We grew up with it and it would be a very sad time if it was
destroyed. I had somebody paint a picture of it because it was so
special to me," Luna said.</TE>
<TE>   "It just seemed like I felt something when I went in there. It
wasn't cold like the new church. It was just a warm feeling."</TE>
<TE>   The redwood-and-pine chapel was dedicated as Simi Valley
Presbyterian Church on Aug. 10, 1902. The park district and
Historical Society will commemorate the building's centennial with an
evening celebration Aug. 9.</TE>
<TE>   Without enough Presbyterians to keep the church going, the
congregation moved out in 1908, Havens said. However, Catholics began
celebrating monthly Masses in the chapel soon after and bought the
building in 1912.</TE>
<TE>   The next year it was dedicated as the Chapel of St. Rose of Lima,
a satellite church of Santa Clara Church in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   Despite more than doubling the chapel's capacity--to 160 seats--in
the 1940s, the building couldn't hold its growing congregation by the
early 1960s. Luna remembers going to Mass early just to get a seat in
the back.</TE>
<TE>   "Pretty soon they had loudspeakers and people standing outside,"
Luna recalled.</TE>
<TE>   When the church's 1,500 families moved into a new church on Royal
Avenue in 1964, the Historical Society wanted to acquire the
building, but resident Armand Banaga, who drilled water wells for
area farmers, bought the church property in 1973, said his son, Ruben
Banaga.</TE>
<TE>   The chapel briefly housed other congregations and served as a
rehearsal studio for Ruben Banaga's Latin rock band, but remained
mostly vacant for the next 37 years. The Historical Society never
gave up and in December, the Banaga family sold the chapel to the
park district for $10,000.</TE>
<TE>   The renovation of the St. Rose chapel will include building a
foundation, restoring a vaulted ceiling and constructing a back
patio, pergola and garden. Construction of the foundation is expected
to begin in September.</TE>
<TE>   Havens hopes the refurbished chapel, along with two early Simi
Valley homes and the city's first library nearby in the park, will
enable visitors to visualize the town before tract homes and strip
malls.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so important to get people to slow down and recognize their
heritage," Havens said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawn party to raise money for restoration of St. Rose of Lima
church, 1 to 4 p.m. today at Strathearn  Historical Park, 137
Strathearn Place, Simi Valley. Lawn games, light lunch, entertainment
and door prizes. $15 for adults; $10 for children 12 and younger. For
information, call 526-6453.</TE>

<HD>Seldom Seen Beaked Whale Washes Up on Beach</HD>
<DH>Marine life: Scientists are hoping to learn more about the
species. It's been years since one has been recovered in the Los
Angeles area.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The discovery of a dead Cuvier's beaked whale Friday morning near the
Manhattan Beach Pier stoked the curiosity of scientists, who hope to
learn more about a rarely seen animal.</LD>
<LD>   The 18-foot-long male whale, probably in its puberty, was found on
shore by lifeguards about 7 a.m., said John Heyning, deputy director
of research and collections at the Natural History Museum of Los
Angeles County.</LD>
<LD>   The species, discovered in 1823 by a French anatomist, looks like
a large, dark slate-gray dolphin, he said. They can grow to 40 feet
and typically dive deep and far offshore.</LD>
<TE>   The last known Cuvier's whale to wash up in the Los Angeles area
was found in Marina del Rey in 1988. Like the most recent find, that
whale was taken to a museum warehouse in Vernon for research.</TE>
<TE>   "While it's sad, there's a benefit in that you learn so much about
these whales," Heyning said. "There's a natural curiosity, but these
discoveries are important later on issues of management and human
impact."</TE>
<TE>   Most beached Cuvier's whales are either newborns or adults,
Heyning said. So the discovery of a pubescent whale could be helpful
in gathering information on the animals at that stage of life, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists will try to determine if domoic acid poisoning, which
has killed 80 dolphins and hundreds of sea lions in recent months,
may have killed the whale, Heyning said.</TE>
<TE>   Heyning said he will also try to find out if the whale may have
died as a result of noise pollution. A federal study in December
found that Navy sonar tests were what probably caused 16
whales--including five Cuvier's beaked whales--to beach themselves in
the Bahamas in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   High levels of sound can annoy or displace whales, or cause
varying degrees of deafness or even death through hemorrhaging,
Heyning said.</TE>
<TE>   "People are putting a lot more sound in the water and a lot of
people are trying to find out what impact that has in terms of noise
pollution," he said. The beached whale could yield clues in that
controversy, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Before the whale was trucked away from the beach, Heyning schooled
some curious children nearby about the discovery.</TE>
<TE>   "They were very excited, asking lots of questions. When kids see
something so impressive, it can leave a lasting impression," he said.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Tollway Is Set for Widening</HD>
<DH>Transportation: Four miles of northbound Foothill-Eastern
will gain a lane as part of a $12.9-million project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County toll road officials held a ceremony Friday to
officially announce the widening of a four-mile stretch of the
Foothill-Eastern toll road between Santa Margarita and Bake parkways,
a project scheduled to get underway next month.</LD>
<LD>   Although its sister road, the San Joaquin Hills tollway, has
failed to meet traffic and revenue projections since it opened in
1996, the Foothill-Eastern is busy.</LD>
<LD>   During peak hours, the tollway serves more than 4,600 commuters
headed north from Lake Forest, Portola Hills, Mission Viejo and other
south Orange County communities.</LD>
<TE>   The $12.9-million project will add a northbound lane and widen
five bridges. The contractor, Irvine-based Ortiz Enterprises Inc., is
expected to complete the work by late 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo Mayor Susan Withrow, a member of the
Foothill-Eastern board of directors, called the widening a milestone
for the toll roads, "a testament to how far we've come since 1993."</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the Foothill-Eastern tollway this month agreed to
consider a merger with the ailing San Joaquin Hills toll road, which
might not be able to meet its debts if nothing is done. The
Foothill-Eastern and the San Joaquin Hills tollways are managed by
the Transportation Corridor Agencies, a government entity that is
based in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   The TCA's toll roads are financed independent of each other and
governed by separate boards of directors.</TE>

<LD>Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi launched a weeklong trip today to
meet with members of her pro-democracy party in her first political
trip outside the capital since her release from house arrest last
month, a top party official said.</LD>
<LD>   Among the places she will visit is Natmauk, the hometown of her
late father, Gen. Aung San, the country's founding father.</LD>
<LD>   Suu Kyi was put under house arrest in September 2000 for
attempting to leave the capital, Yangon, to conduct political
organizing. She was released May 6. The ruling junta had previously
kept her under house arrest from 1989 to 1995. Suu Kyi won the Nobel
Peace Prize in 1991.</LD>

<HD>Israelis Open Fire in Jenin, Killing 4</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>As Palestinians in the West Bank city of Jenin emerged from their
homes Friday and rushed toward the downtown market during what they
thought was a break in the military-imposed curfew, Israeli tanks
opened fire on a crowd, killing three children and an adult.</LD>
<LD>   The army promptly apologized for what it said was an error on the
part of soldiers who saw a throng of Palestinians approaching.</LD>
<LD>   But in the unforgiving climate of the current conflict, in which
mistakes are not easily brushed aside, the incident was brandished by
Palestinians as a "new massacre." It seemed almost certain to raise
the level of rhetoric and violence sweeping through the region.</LD>
<TE>   It was one of several deadly incidents Friday in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip that left 10 Palestinians dead--the highest daily death
toll on the Palestinian side since last month, when Israel concluded
a military operation designed to root out terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   In what was said to be a tumultuous closed session, the Israeli
Cabinet met to endorse a new policy announced this week to occupy and
hold pockets of Palestinian territory as a response to and deterrent
against terrorism. Government ministers reportedly discussed other
tactics--among them, expelling Palestinians believed to be supporting
terrorism and punishing family members of suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   But officials admitted after the meeting that they were
floundering in their efforts to come up with new ideas to stop the
suicide bombings and other attacks, which in the last four days have
claimed the lives of 31 Israeli civilians, including a settler and
three of her children who were killed Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many problems, so many questions and very few
answers," Communications Minister Reuven Rivlin said after the
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "All of these means have been tried separately in the past, but we
are looking at a cocktail of measures that, if used together, might
be able to stop the madness," said Raanan Gissin, a spokesman for
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   In Orlando, Fla., President Bush called the week's wave of deadly
suicide bombings and attacks "outrageous." The violence prompted the
postponement of a speech in which he planned to unveil a peace plan
for the region.</TE>
<TE>   "There are obviously some in the Middle East who want to use
violence to destroy any hopes for peace," he said while visiting a
seniors center. "And the world must do everything in its power to
prevent the few from creating misery for the many."</TE>
<TE>   Bush gave no sign that he intended to call on Israel for
restraint. "Israel has got the right to defend herself," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The president also brushed aside questions about when he would
deliver his address on the Middle East. "I'll give the speech when
I'm ready," he told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few days, the Israeli army has plunged deep into
Palestinian-controlled territory in the West Bank, rounding up
suspected terrorists and imposing curfews. But the military
operations have been accompanied by civilian casualties. Of the 10
Palestinians killed Friday, half were children.</TE>
<TE>   The army said in a statement that its troops were in Jenin trying
to locate an explosives laboratory. Maintaining that a curfew was
still in place, officials said the soldiers were surprised to see
Palestinians approaching, and they fired two tank shells to deter
them.</TE>
<TE>   "An initial inquiry indicates that the force erred in its action,"
the statement concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians saw the incident as part of a gruesome conspiracy,
with Voice of Palestine radio describing the alleged lifting of the
curfew as "a trap by occupation forces."</TE>
<TE>   Jenin was sealed off to journalists Friday, making it difficult to
confirm what happened.</TE>
<TE>   Jamal Shati, a Palestinian legislator, said by telephone that
shooting erupted as people were rushing out of their homes to take
advantage of a one-hour lifting of a curfew that had been in place
for three days. Most needed to shop, but others were headed to the
mosque to pray.</TE>
<TE>   "We did not expect they would shoot at us. We thought the lifting
of the curfew meant we could leave our homes, get our supplies and
come back safely," Shati said. "Everybody was out on the streets....
It is a miracle that there were not more people killed because of all
the shooting."</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed abu Ghali, a doctor at the Jenin Government Hospital,
identified the dead as a 5-year-old girl and two boys, ages 7 and 11.
The slain man was a 50-year-old teacher. About 20 people were
injured, hospital officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Before dawn, a 13-year-old Palestinian boy was killed in Jenin
when Israeli soldiers blew up a house and the boy's home next door
collapsed. Other members of the family were seriously injured.</TE>
<TE>   During a military operation Friday in the Gaza Strip, a
10-year-old Palestinian boy was killed. Although there were
conflicting versions of what happened, it appeared that the Israeli
army was shooting at a house where it believed Palestinian militants
had fired on the Jewish settlement of Netzarim, according to
Palestinian sources.</TE>
<TE>   At an industrial park in northern Gaza, a Palestinian threw a
grenade at soldiers. The Israelis fired back, killing the attacker as
well as two Palestinian workers nearby.</TE>
<TE>   In the West Bank, a 22-year-old Palestinian man was reported
killed during a rampage by settlers returning from the funeral of the
Israeli woman and three children who were slain Thursday by a gunman
who burst into their home.</TE>
<TE>   After the funeral, the settlers reportedly stormed through the
nearby Palestinian village of Hawara, randomly shooting and burning
cars.</TE>

<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>It was one of the greatest upsets in soccer history. Playing in their
first and only World Cup, the lowly North Koreans stunned the sports
world in 1966 by beating the favored Italian team and advancing to
the quarterfinals.</LD>
<LD>   "The fall of the Roman Empire has nothing on this!" proclaimed a
British newspaper, while a breathless television commentator was left
gasping: "They've won! Good heavens, they've won!"</LD>
<LD>   This year, the North Koreans are conspicuous only by their
absence.</LD>
<TE>   The reclusive Communist regime didn't try to qualify for the 2002
World Cup, which is being held in Japan and South Korea, and spurned
all efforts to get it involved. It declined when South Korea offered
to relinquish hosting duties for some matches so they could take
place in Pyongyang, the North's capital. It gave the South Koreans
the brushoff when they suggested that a few North Korean athletes
play with the South Korean team.</TE>
<TE>   The North Koreans didn't even bother to RSVP to an invitation to
send a symbolic delegation to the May 31 opening ceremony in Seoul.
Among those who had been invited was Pak Doo Ik, who scored the
winning kick in the 1966 match against Italy.</TE>
<TE>   The only solace for South Koreans who had wanted to celebrate the
World Cup with their estranged brethren is the mere fact that North
Korean television broadcast some matches--albeit illegally, with
pirated tapes, because it never paid for the broadcasting rights.</TE>
<TE>   "At least it indicates they have a keen interest," said Lin Byung
Taik, a spokesman for the South Korean organizing committee for the
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their standoffishness, the North Koreans are hardly
forgotten. Their brief shining moment in the 1966 World Cup has been
a constant point of reference in the 2002 games, especially when
South Korea beat Italy. During Tuesday's match in Daejon, South
Korea, fans held up placards reading, "Again, 1966," which so
irritated the Italians that they complained to the FIFA, the
governing soccer association.</TE>
<TE>   Fading memories have also been refreshed by a newly released
British documentary about the 1966 North Korean team that has been
airing on South Korean television.</TE>
<TE>   "The Game of Their Lives" set out to solve what had been a
long-standing mystery among devotees of the sport: What happened to
the North Korean team afterward?</TE>
<TE>   It was well known that the Italians slunk home to be pelted with
tomatoes by angry fans. (To this day, any disaster in Italian soccer
is referred to as "another Korea.")</TE>
<TE>   But at least as far as the outside world was concerned, the North
Koreans vanished into oblivion. They never played in another World
Cup. It was darkly rumored that the players had been sent to prison
camp as punishment either for drinking and womanizing or--the rumor
had many permutations--for losing to Portugal in the next match.</TE>
<TE>   The true story was far less dramatic. When the British filmmakers,
Dan Gordon and Nick Bonner, tracked down the players in North Korea,
they were living in a style befitting retired athletes of any
country--in comfortable, though not lavish, homes cluttered with
sports memorabilia. Most of them were working as coaches.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole story that they were purged was Cold War propaganda,"
Bonner said. "They returned to North Korea as national heroes. They
still are national heroes. People might not recognize their faces,
but they know their names."</TE>
<TE>   Members of the 1966 team were thrilled to talk to the filmmakers
about the glorious match against Italy, although they used the
opportunity as a platform to praise the North Korean system of
government and ideology.</TE>
<TE>   The players recalled that before leaving for the tournament, they
had a personal audience with North Korea's founder and then-leader,
the late Kim Il Sung, who urged them to win a match to overturn the
European domination of world soccer.</TE>
<TE>   "If I conceded a goal, the reputation of North Korea would fail.
We would have failed in the task set by the Great Leader. Therefore,
I guarded the goal with my life," goalkeeper Ri Chan Myong recalled.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, the North Koreans were only the second Asian team to
play in the World Cup and were viewed as a curiosity. The average
height of the North Korean players was 5-foot-5, and one sports
commentator, Dennis Barry, told the filmmakers that "it was like
watching a team of jockeys playing."</TE>
<TE>   Also, it was the height of the Cold War--the fact that a team from
a Communist country had qualified for a tournament taking place in
England caused a diplomatic uproar. In particular, the South Korean
government had lobbied the British not to admit the team from the
North.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the jealousy, South Koreans who remember the 1966 World
Cup say they cheered when the North Koreans beat Italy, and a
bootlegged film of the game sold in Seoul at the time for as much as
$500, according to Chang Heng Hoon, who was one of the few South
Korean journalists who covered the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Chang added, however, that the North Korean players today are not
nearly as good as the South Korean team because of their relative
lack of exposure to international matches since the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   South Korean President Kim Dae Jung had been eager to involve the
North Koreans in the World Cup as a means of promoting his Nobel
Peace Prize-winning "sunshine policy" of engagement with the North.
Numerous envoys from Seoul--as well as FIFA chief Joseph "Sepp"
Blatter--have traveled to Pyongyang in recent years with various
enticing propositions.</TE>
<TE>   There were ambitious dreams for flights between Seoul and
Pyongyang during the monthlong tournament so World Cup tourists could
also attend a festival marking the 90th anniversary of the late
leader Kim's birth. There was a plan to repair rail links that have
been severed since the end of the Korean War in 1953 so Chinese
soccer fans could use land routes to visit South Korea for the games.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing materialized.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing went any further than the drawing board. I think it was
just the wrong timing, and the whole business with the 'axis of evil'
speech didn't help matters," said filmmaker Bonner, a North Korea
expert who lives in Beijing, referring to President Bush's
characterization of North Korea, Iraq and Iran.</TE>
<TE>   The latest plan calls for North Korea's national soccer team to
visit Seoul on Sept. 6-9 to play a friendly match with the South
Korean team. The North Koreans have agreed, according to the European
Union Chamber of Commerce, which is sponsoring the match. Whether it
does indeed take place will be something of a litmus test for the
drift of North and South Korean relations.</TE>
<TE>   Sports enthusiasts here say that soccer and other sports might
just be the prescription for restarting the stalled North-South peace
process.</TE>
<TE>   "Football can be about nationalism," said Lin of the South Korean
organizing committee, "but it can also be a strong vehicle to promote
cooperation between countries."</TE>

<HD>Philippine Guerrilla's Body Sought</HD>
<DH>Asia: Bush hails the death of Abu Sabaya, who was
apparently killed in a shootout.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK and JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Philippine fishermen and soldiers searched today off
the coast of Mindanao island for the body of rebel leader Abu Sabaya,
who was reportedly killed Friday in a gun battle with Philippine
commandos.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush applauded Sabaya's death and Pentagon officials
here said Friday that their deployment of more than 1,000 U.S. troops
to the Philippines to train soldiers had paid off during Friday's
clash.</LD>
<LD>   The Philippine government announced a reward of $1,000 for the
recovery of Sabaya's body, which is presumed to have sunk with those
of two other rebels believed killed in the early-morning gunfight at
sea.</LD>
<TE>   Philippine military officials acknowledged that the body--and
absolute proof of Sabaya's death--might elude them. The battle took
place in shark-infested waters nearly a mile from shore where the
currents are strong and the water is about 1,500 feet deep. Sabaya
presumably was weighed down with ammunition and heavy boots.</TE>
<TE>   Four members of the Abu Sayyaf rebel group who were arrested
during the clash were identified by former hostages as being among
Sabaya's inner circle. One soldier reported shooting Sabaya from a
distance of three feet.</TE>
<TE>   Sunglasses like the ones Sabaya usually wore and a satellite phone
were found among the wreckage of the boat. Sabaya was known for
calling radio stations from a satellite telephone and taunting
Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has offered a reward of as much as $5 million for the
capture or killing of Abu Sayyaf leaders, including Sabaya. It was
unclear how the reward money might be parceled out with the report of
his death.</TE>
<TE>   Bush praised Arroyo for the government's campaign against the Abu
Sayyaf and the apparent death of Sabaya, saying she "did the world a
great service."</TE>
<TE>   Abu Sayyaf says it is fighting for the creation of an Islamic
state in the southern Philippines, but its main activity has been
kidnapping for ransom. The U.S. government believes that Abu Sayyaf
is linked to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist group.</TE>
<TE>   A group of Abu Sayyaf rebels led by Sabaya kidnapped American
missionaries Martin and Gracia Burnham in May 2001 and held them for
more than a year before Philippine commandos, trained in part by
American soldiers, rescued Gracia Burnham earlier this month. Martin
Burnham and hostage Deborah Yap, a Philippine nurse, were killed
during the effort.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. military advisors, who arrived in the Philippines in
February, have been limited to training large groups of soldiers,
although American commanders have urged the Bush administration to
let them join Philippine troops on jungle patrols in search of
guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   This month, Bush and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld agreed.
But military analysts said Friday's operation and the rescue of
Gracia Burnham suggest that the Pentagon's original, more limited
strategy has worked.</TE>
<TE>   The Philippine soldiers carried out both operations during a
two-week mission that was planned in part by American commanders.
U.S. surveillance and communications gear, American intelligence,
infantry tactics drilled by Green Beret trainers and night water
assault tactics taught by Navy SEALs were used in the operations.</TE>
<TE>   As Philippine troops fired on Sabaya, American soldiers waited out
of range. Then they swept in on two MH-47 Chinook helicopters to
search for survivors of the 4:30 a.m. firefight off the southwestern
coast of Mindanao.</TE>
<TE>   "What these two incidents suggest is that the administration's
approach is working rather well," said Daniel Goure, a defense
analyst and former Pentagon official now with the Lexington
Institute, a national security think tank.</TE>
<TE>   "This group has been a thorn in the side of the Filipino people
for a decade or more, and the Philippines government up to this point
was really unable to deal with this group," he added. "They have now
in two weeks struck two important blows to Abu Sayyaf as a result of
U.S. support."</TE>
<TE>   Though U.S. forces helped plan both encounters and shared
intelligence, it was Philippine intelligence that ultimately led to
the Burnhams and then to Sabaya.</TE>
<TE>   Reports of the success of the six-month U.S. training and advisory
mission, which is to end July 31, have not been unqualified. In
addition to the deaths of Yap and Martin Burnham, Philippine
commanders note that hundreds of rebel fighters remain on the
southern island of Jolo.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say they fear a resurgence of the conflict once the
Americans leave.</TE>
<TE>   Defense officials said the Philippine model reflects a measured
strategy by the Bush administration--particularly Rumsfeld--to keep
American soldiers as far out of harm's way in situations where allies
are willing to do most of the work in fighting terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to go around the world and be the ones that
address and tackle the problems of terrorism in every country, but
where we can and where the countries want us to we will go in and
help countries combat terrorism," Pentagon spokeswoman Victoria
Clarke said. "We're very much in the supportive role."</TE>

<HD>Ex-Chief of Serb State TV Gets Prison</HD>
<DH>Yugoslavia: Court finds him guilty of public endangerment
in the deaths of 16 workers killed by NATO bombing in 1999.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY and ZORAN CIRJAKOVIC</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia</DL>
<LD>The former head of Serbian state television was sentenced Friday to
nearly 10 years in prison for failing to protect 16 employees killed
by a NATO bomb in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   A Serbian court ruled that Dragoljub Milanovic caused "grave
danger to public security" by failing to evacuate the Radio
Television Serbia building in Belgrade after the bombing began.
Technicians, doormen and a makeup artist were killed in the precision
nighttime attack.</LD>
<LD>   "He failed to act according to regulations governing the safety of
RTS, even though he was aware this could provoke danger for the lives
of the people because NATO aggression had already started," said
presiding Judge Radmila Dragicevic-Dicic.</LD>
<TE>   The station formed a key part of former Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's power base. The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization hit it April 23, 1999, as part of a 78-day bombing
campaign aimed at forcing Milosevic to end his repression of ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo.</TE>
<TE>   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia, and is now under United Nations administration. Reformers
ousted Milosevic in October 2000 and eight months later sent him to
face a U.N. war crimes trial in The Hague.</TE>
<TE>   Some relatives of victims have charged that Milosevic's government
deliberately kept the television workers in danger because their
deaths would score a propaganda coup. Milanovic was a high-ranking
member of Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia.</TE>
<TE>   The Western alliance drew international condemnation after the
bombing for deliberately targeting journalists.</TE>
<TE>   "NATO's decision to target civilian broadcast facilities not only
increases the danger for reporters now working in Yugoslavia, but
permanently jeopardizes all journalists ... in international
conflicts," the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists
declared at the time.</TE>
<TE>   NATO defended its action with the argument that the state-run
station's employees were propaganda workers participating in
Milosevic's war effort.</TE>
<TE>   Radio Television Serbia "is as much a part of Milosevic's murder
machine as his army" because "it has stirred up nationalistic
passions in the country," Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon said
after the bombing.</TE>
<TE>   Even as she sentenced Milanovic, Dragicevic-Dicic disputed NATO's
argument. "I am not giving amnesty to NATO as the direct perpetrator
of a serious criminal act against humanity," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In the verdict, the judge said Milanovic had failed to obey a
federal government order that institutions able to move to more
secure reserve facilities during the state of war should do so.</TE>
<TE>   Such facilities were available to RTS in a wooded suburb of
Belgrade, the Yugoslav and Serbian capital.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not up to you to assess the danger," the judge said.
"There was an order, and you should have acted upon it."</TE>
<TE>   Milanovic argued in a closing statement Thursday that bombing the
suburban facilities would have been easier for NATO than hitting the
main building in Belgrade.</TE>
<TE>   "The indictment against me is beyond honor and reason," Milanovic
told the court. "I really believed that NATO would not dare to commit
a terrible crime against civilians. RTS was not a legitimate military
target, and it was protected by international conventions. I thought
that my employees, as civilians, were safe in a civilian
installation.</TE>
<TE>   "The legal representative of the families called me an
executioner, monster and man-eater," he added, "but I claim that very
soon the time will come when the prosecutor will be ashamed of the
indictment."</TE>
<TE>   Milanovic was sentenced to 9 1/2 years on the charge of failure to
evacuate the station. He was given an additional six months'
imprisonment for an unrelated financial charge.</TE>
<TE>   After sentencing, Milanovic reiterated his innocence and said
documentary evidence against him had been forged. He was not
immediately imprisoned, but the judge ordered him not to leave
Belgrade.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Branimir Gugl called the verdict "a disgrace to
the entire legal system" and said Milanovic would appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Milanovic "followed direct orders by the government and the head
of state," Gugl added.</TE>
<TE>   Some observers have interpreted this claim by Gugl as pointing a
finger at Milosevic.</TE>

<HD>Rite Aid Officers Indicted on Fraud</HD>
<DH>Courts: The U.S. charges three former executives of the
drugstore chain, alleging a massive accounting hoax that inflated
earnings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON and KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A federal grand jury indicted three former executives of drugstore
chain Rite Aid Corp. on Friday on charges of running a massive
accounting fraud that experts described as brazen even when measured
against other recent corporate scandals.</LD>
<LD>   The 37-count criminal indictment alleged that Rite Aid's former
Chief Executive Martin L. Grass and two other senior officers used a
variety of bogus accounting maneuvers to inflate the company's
earnings in the late 1990s and, in turn, the firm's stock price and
their own compensation.</LD>
<LD>   The hoax alleged by the government resulted in the biggest
restatement of earnings in U.S. history--$1.6 billion--when it
eventually unraveled.</LD>
<TE>   The Rite Aid indictment marks the third time in three weeks that
prominent corporate figures have been charged with criminal be-
havior, adding to the crisis of confidence that has enveloped
America's business leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, L. Dennis Kozlowski, the deposed chief
executive of Tyco International Ltd., was indicted on charges of
evading New York state and city sales taxes. Last week, Samuel
Waksal, former CEO of ImClone Systems Inc., was charged with insider-
trading violations.</TE>
<TE>   If the government's allegations prove true, what went on at Rite
Aid, the nation's third-largest drugstore chain, would far transcend
the aggressive accounting that helped cause the collapses of Enron
Corp., Global Crossing Ltd. and Adelphia Communications Corp., said
Seth Taube, a white- collar defense attorney at McCarter &amp; English in
Newark, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   At Rite Aid, the government alleged, a top executive simply
ordered underlings to alter bookkeeping records by tens of millions
of dollars to make the company's financial results appear better than
they were.</TE>
<TE>   When the Camp Hill, Pa.-based firm was in desperate need of a bank
loan to avert bankruptcy in late 1999, Grass allegedly told lenders
that a Rite Aid committee had agreed to pledge stock in a key
subsidiary as collateral. In truth, the committee had never met and
Grass had falsified the paperwork, the government alleged.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't pushing the edge of the ethical envelope," Taube said
of the Rite Aid charges. "Here the envelope was torn up and thrown
away. You can get a gun and rob a bank, or you can make up numbers at
a public company. Either way, it's a crime."</TE>
<TE>   The most serious charges were leveled at Grass; Franklyn M.
Bergonzi, Rite Aid's former chief financial officer; and Franklin
Brown, its former chief counsel.</TE>
<TE>   The charges against Grass and Brown include securities fraud,
conspiracy to defraud, obstruction of justice and witness tampering.
The Bergonzi charges include securities fraud, conspiracy to defraud
and making false statements to the Securities and Exchange
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Also named in the indictment was Eric S. Sorkin, an executive vice
president and the only current employee indicted. He was charged with
obstruction of justice and making false statements to a grand jury.
The company suspended Sorkin on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Timothy J. Noonan, Rite Aid's former president, cooperated with
prosecutors and agreed to plead guilty to concealing knowledge of
wrongdoing by others.</TE>
<TE>   None of the executives responded to requests for interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Grass said in a written statement that he had not read the lengthy
indictment, but he added that he "did not knowingly engage in any
illegal acts" and would "vigorously" defend himself.</TE>
<TE>   Bergonzi's attorney, Ira Raphaelson, said the real problem is
confusing accounting rules.</TE>
<TE>   "The rules are unclear," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC ended an investigation of Rite Aid itself without
assessing any fines against the company, which agreed to a
cease-and-desist order but neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.
Current management has cooperated with investigators, the SEC said.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC lodged civil fraud charges against Grass, Bergonzi and
Brown that parallel many of those in the criminal charges, which were
filed by the U.S. attorney's office in Harrisburg, Pa. The SEC
accused the men of masterminding the ruse to pump up Rite Aid's
earnings and share price, overstating profit by 5,533% in the second
quarter of 1999 alone.</TE>
<TE>   Between May 1997 and May 1999, the three men inflated the
company's income and understated expenses, frequently by cheating
vendors, the SEC alleged. Improved financial results helped boost
executives' performance-based pay, the government said.</TE>
<TE>   Grass also is accused of funneling $2.6 million from Rite Aid to a
real estate partnership he ran with his brother-in-law. Part of the
money, the government said, was used to buy an 83-acre parcel
supposedly intended for a new Rite Aid corporate headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   The company later spent an additional $1 million to improve the
property, even though the land was owned by the partnership, not Rite
Aid, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   When questioned by the media about the land, Grass transferred
$2.9 million back to the company, according to the SEC. None of the
transactions was disclosed to the company's board, the SEC said.</TE>
<TE>   Grass is the eldest son of Rite Aid founder Alex Grass. After
taking charge of what was a regional pharmacy chain in 1995, he
undertook an aggressive expansion plan that included the purchase of
the Thrifty PayLess drugstore chain on the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   But Rite Aid struggled to consolidate its new purchases and the
company's earnings suffered.</TE>
<TE>   In October 1999, Martin Grass was forced out as CEO as the company
announced it would restate results for fiscal 1999 and the previous
two years. A month later, the SEC launched a formal probe into the
company's finances. The agency had begun a review of Rite Aid's
accounting of acquisitions earlier that year.</TE>
<TE>   The company is under new management but has struggled to overcome
the financial strain caused by the late-1990s acquisition binge and
profit restatements.</TE>
<TE>   As with other financial scandals, Rite Aid shareholders have
absorbed a huge shock: The stock, which traded as high as $50.94 a
share in January 1999, closed Friday at $2.69, up 11 cents.</TE>
<TE>   In December 2000, the company settled with aggrieved shareholders
for $200 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Rite Aid indictments, in tandem with the arrests of Kozlowski
and Waksal, point to what may become a dramatic shift in the
prosecution of white-collar crime.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate executives convicted of financial crimes typically face
fines and sanctions on their ability to conduct business. But the
number of recent scandals and the magnitude of alleged fraud and
self-dealing make it likely that some executives will go to jail,
experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "For these people, being barred from their jobs and having to pay
fines can be very painful, but obviously going to jail is much more
painful," said Caren Pennington, assistant regional director of the
SEC's Northeast division, which brought the accompanying civil
charges.</TE>

<TE>   SEC Charges Against Rite Aid Officers</TE>
<TE>   A summary of Securities and Exchange Commission accounting fraud
charges against Rite Aid's former Chief Executive Martin L. Grass,
former Chief Financial Officer Franklyn M. Bergonzi and Franklin
Brown, former chief counsel. The U.S. attorney's office filed related
criminal charges:</TE>
<TE>   * Rite Aid systematically inflated deductions it took against
amounts owed to vendors for damaged and outdated products, resulting
in $36 million in overstatements of pretax income for fiscal years
1998 and '99.</TE>
<TE>   * Rite Aid did not record expenses from a program allowing
employees to get cash or stock tied to the company's stock price,
which should have accrued $55 million in expenses for fiscal years
1998 and '99.</TE>
<TE>   * Bergonzi told accounting staffers to make improper entries to
reduce the cost of goods sold and accounts payable in each quarter
except at year's end, when financial statements would be audited.
Such actions, for example, led to overstated pretax income of $100
million in the second quarter of fiscal year 1999.</TE>
<TE>   * Grass did not disclose his personal interest in three properties
the company leased as store locations or $2.6 million funneled from
Rite Aid to a partnership he and a relative controlled.</TE>
<TE>   * Grass fabricated minutes of a supposed meeting in which the
company finance committee accepted a pledge of Rite Aid stock in PCS
Health Systems Inc. as collateral, although no such meeting occurred
and the pledge was unauthorized.</TE>

<DH>Working in the shadow of abuse scandals, one longtime
priest presses on with untiring service to God and community.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 23rd anniversary of the Rev. Msgr. David O'Connell's ordination
would be marked by a partial solar eclipse. But when the alarm went
off at 5:30 that Monday morning, the priest was unaware of either
event.</LD>
<LD>   Thudding down the carpeted stairs in the rectory of St. Frances
Xavier Catholic Church in South-Central Los Angeles, O'Connell was
thinking about his dog.</LD>
<LD>   For years he had wanted a dog but had feared, he says, "that a
priest's dog would die of loneliness." Then one day, a big black dog,
mostly chow with some sort of shepherd mixed in, wandered onto the
asphalt lot that separates the rectory from the church's school.</LD>
<TE>   All night the dog sat behind the rectory, wailing like a
banshee--"Wailinlikeabanshee," O'Connell says again as he tells the
story, running the words into an onomatopoeic train as only a native
of Ireland can. So finally he broke down and let the dog in. "If you
want to join the priesthood," man told beast, "it's all right with
me."</TE>
<TE>   That was four years ago and since then the priest has begun his
morning by walking his dog at dawn. It is the high point of the dog's
day and one of the constant satisfactions of the man's.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell faces a working day that can last 16 hours in a place
where the problems seem unending. At the same time, the ideal image
of the priesthood--a vocation to provide spiritual guidance,
strength, succor--has been eclipsed by scandal just as the sun this
day will be eclipsed by the moon.</TE>
<TE>   The list of priests who have abused children is horrifyingly long;
the list of those who abetted them longer. Yet neither comes close in
number to the majority of this country's 46,000 Catholic priests who
strive daily to fulfill their vows--men who spend days and nights
aiding the poor, the ailing, the criminal, the troubled, even as yet
another of their own is revealed to have abused those entrusted to
his care.</TE>
<TE>   Like many other priests, O'Connell, who is 48, is appalled and
angered by the continual revelations of pathology and corruption, and
by what has seemed like a continuing attempt by the church to defend
the indefensible. But he remains a visible symbol of that church;
every morning he puts on the black shirt and white Roman collar
because it is the uniform of the work he still believes in--serving
God and his people.</TE>
<TE>   For 14 years, O'Connell has been pastor at St. Frances Cabrini,
and just recently he also became pastor of nearby Ascension. This
means overseeing, not only two congregations of roughly 4,000
families each, but also two schools that between them serve about 500
pupils in kindergarten through eighth grade. The parishes are less
than a mile apart, but there is a language and racial
division--Cabrini is mostly African American, Ascension primarily
Spanish-speaking Latino.</TE>
<TE>   Both neighborhoods are very poor and bogged down by issues of
survival, and so are the duties of their priest. O'Connell spends a
lot of time encouraging his parishioners to speak up for
themselves--to fight for new stop signs and safer playgrounds, to
demand that politicians keep their promises.</TE>
<TE>   What O'Connell considers his failures are starkly obvious and
irrevocable. Recently, in the space of one week, he said three
funeral Masses for victims of gang-related shootings.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids are organized," he says. "The adults are not. We have to
unite to show them a different way."</TE>
<TE>   But O'Connell is a priest, not a social worker. He absolutely
believes that the answers to human failings can be found in the
Gospel, that, sought or unsought, God is with us. And so on this
Monday morning, 23 years after he took his vows at All Hallow's
Seminary in Dublin, the priest returns from his walk, feeds himself
and his dog and spends an hour in the pale chilly silence of the
church, alone with his thoughts and his God.</TE>
<TE>   Then, under an overcast sky, he gets into his Saturn station wagon
and heads down Imperial Highway to 8 a.m. Mass at Ascension Church.</TE>
<TE>   Ascension is not a beautiful church. There are bars over the
stained-glass windows, the mosaic depicting the Ascension is faded
and pocked. It stands in the crook of the Century and Harbor
freeways, where a soaring transition road turns north, away from the
airport and toward downtown. The surrounding blocks are drab and
grim, full of small motels and impound lots.</TE>
<TE>   But the houses across from the school and rectory are bright with
grass and roses, and inside the small chapel where morning Mass is
said, the singing masks every other noise. Twenty or so people, most
of them women, have gathered amid the wooden chairs, several with
children in tow.</TE>
<TE>   When saying Mass here, O'Connell is often the only non-Latino in
the room, but his Spanish is as quick and melodic as his
parishioners'.</TE>
<TE>   In his homily, he speaks directly to the people he sees before
him, people he clearly knows. One has just lost a husband, another is
struggling to find work, and yet they too are blessed, he says. Can
they say how they feel blessed? The homily takes a turn, becoming a
conversation rather than a sermon. One by one, members of the
congregation admit their troubles, but also their joys--of family, of
faith, of community.</TE>
<TE>   "I want it to be a dialogue," O'Connell says later. "People need
to feel the Gospel is part of their lives, a real part of their
lives. They need to feel this about the church as well. They need a
say in it all, even the homily."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the day, O'Connell will say similar things to many
people in a variety of contexts. He believes that people have become
too withdrawn, isolated from one another, and in that isolation we
too often seek private solutions when the answers should be communal.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether it's violence or gangs or secession," he says, "people
would rather walk away. They have forgotten how to unite, how to even
talk to one another. I have learned this, that I cannot stand
separate as the priest. I have to go out and make things happen."</TE>
<TE>   After Mass, he walks to his office in Ascension's rectory where on
one wall hangs a large picture of an idyllic Irish landscape, on
another a black Madonna and child.</TE>
<TE>   For all his Cork brogue, silvering hair and bright blue eyes,
O'Connell is not the Hollywood version of a garrulous Irish priest.
He has a quiet voice and a restrained manner, as if he were pacing
himself. But he is quick to laugh, occasionally because it seems the
only thing a working priest can do these days.</TE>
<TE>   "Were you sent by the new PR firm then?" he asks when a reporter
requests an interview with him. "Ah, well, we'll say no more about
our fearless leaders and their tactics."</TE>
<TE>   Among priests, talk of the scandals is never initiated exactly,
because the conversation seems continual, inexorable, like the Earth
and moon as they move toward this day's eclipse.</TE>
<TE>   The diocese's recent decision to hire a public relations firm
especially seems to rankle; O'Connell mentions it often, with wry
humor that slowly wears thin until, in the evening, he will say
bitterly: "We don't need PR. We need to fix the problems. If they
don't see that now, what on earth will it take?"</TE>
<TE>   But now it's 9 a.m. and O'Connell has a meeting with other members
of Los Angeles Metro in the community room at Ascension. L.A. Metro
is a group of community and religious leaders from around the county
who have been trying for the past 18 months to organize around
various issues--immigration, education, crime and employment.</TE>
<TE>   A union leader, pastors from several faiths, a social worker, a
handful of organizers and activists, a nun and O'Connell all sit on
metal folding chairs at long tables.</TE>
<TE>   For more than two hours, the group talks of many things, but
mostly about organizing the various congregations and communities to
fight secession, which they see as an attempt to disengage from the
problems facing the city, rather than working together to solve them.</TE>
<TE>   The group wants the mayor to acknowledge that there are legitimate
reasons the Valley and Hollywood want to secede, that these
complaints are shared by other communities, including their own and
that secession is a symptom of a larger chronic lack of governance.
They do not hold out much hope that the mayor will do this.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not a great time for our leaders," Connell says after the
meeting. "In the church or in the city. The bureaucracies have become
too hierarchical, the people feel too removed, there is no
recognition of what the people's lives are really like. Our leaders
seem quite clueless."</TE>
<TE>   He is back in the car, on his way to the school at Cabrini to
attend a farewell assembly for Gilda Marchante, who has taught eighth
grade at the school for 30 years. Rows and rows of children sit
quietly in the gym/auditorium while various people, including
O'Connell, speak of the teacher's devotion and then shower her with
gifts.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward there is a hot dog picnic on the playground. Walking
among the children--the girls in their blue and white plaid dresses,
the boys in white shirts and blue pants--the priest's face brightens
visibly.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell is not a hugging priest, not the sort who naturally
embraces in greeting or parting. But wading through the lines of
children waiting for lunch, he touches a shoulder, a back or the top
of a head. It is impossible to watch this and not think of the
scandals, of the shadow they have thrown over this man and his
brothers. Yet O'Connell says nothing has changed in his interaction
with the children or their parents; he has not felt the people pull
away from him, has not sensed any fear.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they are angry that the church has not done the right
thing," he says. "I think they, like a lot of us, just want a simple
acknowledgment that things were done wrong, a sincere apology and a
promise to get to the real problems."</TE>
<TE>   Parishioners, the priest says, should have more say in the running
of their churches. Women should be ordained and clergy should be able
to marry. "If there had been some parents in there running things,"
he says, "none of this would have ever happened."</TE>
<TE>   In the Cabrini rectory, the priest looks for mail that hasn't come
and chats with Father Anthony Gonzalez, who is the pastoral
administrator. Between them, they say six daily Masses, as many as
eight Saturday Masses (including weddings and quinceanera) and as
many as eight Sunday services.</TE>
<TE>   In a polo shirt and khakis, Gonzalez is the model of a young
modern priest. Together the two men laugh ruefully about what they
see as the mayor's inability to connect with the people, especially
their people, about what they consider the cardinal's obfuscations.
They seem to feel the same amount of distance from one leader as from
another--like the city government, the hierarchy of the church is
"them," the working priests, "us."</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez has been at Cabrini for four years; before that O'Connell
spent several years living in the rectory alone. Two women O'Connell
has known since his first parish in Downey come every Monday to make
dinner for the two. But for the most part, O'Connell and Gonzalez
shift for themselves, eating out of Trader Joe's containers and the
microwave.</TE>
<TE>   "We're so rarely in," says O'Connell. Kept in a large black date
book as hefty and worn as any family Bible, his weekly evening
schedule is a patchwork of meetings--with parish councils, parents
groups, catechists and staff.</TE>
<TE>   After lunch, he heads back to Ascension where a couple who seem
very unhappy are waiting for him; he gives them food coupons and
then, in his office, makes a series of phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   Then at 3, it's on to another L.A. Metro meeting at nearby Locke
High School. Parents in both parishes approach him daily about the
state of the local schools--their children are being threatened or
getting bored, the teachers are dismissive and the administration is
unavailable.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to teach people how to talk to each other again
because, in conversation, solutions just occur naturally," he says.
"I've seen it happen over and over again."</TE>
<TE>   In the L.A. Metro meeting, there are more hard chairs and people
concerned with problems that seem insurmountable. Parents, teachers
and administrators describe issues of illiteracy, poor attendance,
violence and a culture that seems to disdain learning.</TE>
<TE>   It is unusual for the priest to have two such meetings in a
day--tomorrow he will spend much of the early afternoon on the porch
of a 91-year-old parishioner who can no longer attend Mass, listening
to tales of life as a chef on the Southern Pacific Railroad and what
it was like to be the first black family living in what was then the
white section of Watts. "Imagine living through all that and still
such faith, such goodness," O'Connell says as he drives down a
sun-scoured section of 112th Street.</TE>
<TE>   But today he is back at the Cabrini rectory by 5 p.m., where the
table is set for dinner--salad, chicken and rice.</TE>
<TE>   After dinner, he spends a few minutes upstairs in his study. It is
a nice room, with a fireplace and two comfortable armchairs before
it. The mantel is strewn with pictures of his family, especially the
young children of one of his brothers. He goes back to Ireland every
other year to visit them. After a week or 10 days, he says, he begins
to think longingly of Los Angeles, of the weather and the peace of a
solitary life.</TE>
<TE>   "People think the priesthood requires a lot of sacrifice," he
says, "And it does. But nothing like parenthood. You have to give so
much of yourself. Ah, but look at her," he says, picking up a photo
of his niece. "She's a crack she is. They're all lovely kids."</TE>
<TE>   He is the third of five children. A black-and-white photo on the
wall shows a straight-backed serious family; only one of the children
is looking off camera with a faint grin. "The problem middle child,"
the priest says of himself.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell says he knew all his life he wanted to be a priest,
although he still cannot explain why. Just before he entered
seminary, he thought about being a political scientist, but then he
met a priest who had a parish in Los Angeles, and "I thought that
sounded much more interesting."</TE>
<TE>   He took his vows at a time when it was the dream of every Catholic
mother to have a son in the priesthood. A photo on his bookshelf
shows a dark-haired woman kneeling before a young man in a cassock.
"My first blessing after my ordination," he says. "My mother."</TE>
<TE>   During the course of the day, he has remembered that it is his
anniversary, although he still knows nothing about the eclipse.
"Twenty-three years," he says. "I still can't believe it."</TE>
<TE>   He has never regretted his decision, he says, and he certainly
does not now. Most of his colleagues, he says, are determined to see
their church through this dark time. O'Connell believes in the power
of God and community as he believes in the sun; it exists even when
blotted out by human failing, and is larger and brighter than any
obstacle. "It is an honor to see God working in people's lives," the
priest says quietly. "To see people's lives changed by God's love, by
their faith."</TE>
<TE>   The meeting of the Pastoral Counsel of Ascension begins at 7, so
O'Connell leaves the rectory at 6:30 to set up. Stepping outside, he
is struck by the nature of the light. The sky has gone lavender as if
before a storm, and the sun shines darkly, iridescent like the inside
of an abalone shell. "Ah, it's lovely, isn't it," he says, turning
around in the fractured sunlight as if it were a fine rain. "So
strange and lovely."</TE>
<TE>   At the meeting, he leads the 20 or so men and women through
reflections on Matthew 9:36-10:8 in which Christ exhorts his
disciples to aid the lost sheep of the house of Israel. The light
grows darker, odder, as the group discusses the reading. It is a
bilingual group, black and Latino, and a bilingual conversation, with
O'Connell translating when he must.</TE>
<TE>   Halfway into the meeting, a young Latino man speaks of the sudden
surge of faith he has felt in recent months. "I am so surprised at
how much it means to me," he says in English, "How much it makes me
feel. I never thought it would. Never."</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell nods and says, "Now en espanol," and the group laughs.</TE>
<TE>   From behind the black shadow of the moon, the sun slides finally
beyond the horizon. By the time the meeting is over, it is past 9
p.m., but the priest is energized by the conversation. He mentions
the young man.</TE>
<TE>   "You see how it works," he says. "You see how the power of God is
there when you least expect it."</TE>
<TE>   There are still phone calls to be returned now, one from a young
man who wants to meet with him right away. In the priest's office,
the man makes a solemn vow to stop using drugs and O'Connell nods and
tells him it was good to make such a promise but that he was not
going to be able to do it alone. He gives him the numbers of several
recovery groups and sees the man out.</TE>
<TE>   He gets home in time to catch part of a Sarah Brightman concert on
television. His dog sits beside him and sings along. "It's
extraordinary," he says, like a parent of a child. "I don't know if
it means he likes it or he hates it, but it is something to hear."</TE>
<TE>   Then he puts the dog out back and goes to bed at 11. It isn't
until the next day that he realizes there had been a solar eclipse
that made the air shine purple.</TE>
<TE>   "Finally a sign," he says laughing as he walks from the rectory at
Cabrini to the school in the unbroken morning sunshine. "After 23
years, a sign. Do you think perhaps I've got a vocation?"</TE>

<LD>   The conjoined twins from a Guatemalan village were born with
skulls fused at the top, their faces tilted in opposite directions
beneath the thick black hair they share. On Monday, a team of
physicians at UCLA's Mattel Children's Hospital is scheduled to begin
the first attempt to change that, with a rare series of procedures to
separate the infants and grant them independence.</LD>
<LD>   Experts say that such cranial separations have been performed only
five times worldwide in the past 10 years, but not all those twins
survived long past the surgery. Because the two girls share only a
small amount of brain tissue and both their hearts are working well,
doctors at UCLA think their chances for full and unimpaired lives are
good.</LD>
<TE>   Their mother, Alba Leticia Quiej-Alvarez, 22, said she is not
following the medical details closely. She just wants the girls, her
only babies, to have normal childhoods in their hometown in southwest
Guatemala, where she is a housewife and her husband, Wenceslao, 20,
is a farm worker.</TE>
<TE>   "But I don't dream about it. I don't want to have any dreams,
because if you think and think, it doesn't change things," said
Quiej-Alvarez, who speaks Spanish and cannot read or write. She was
interviewed at UCLA, where she and the twins have shared a room since
they were flown in from Guatemala by an international charity last
month. The hospital and doctors are donating services whose cost is
estimated at $1.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Craniopagus conjoined twins, or those joined at the head, have the
rarest of an already rare condition. Conjoined twins occur once in
every 200,000 live births, and only 2% of those twins are
craniopagus, according to a 1990 study published in the journal
Gynecology and Obstetrics. While the girls could remain healthy if
they were unseparated, they would require immense amounts of care,
said Dr. Jorge Lazareff, director of UCLA's department of pediatric
neurosurgery, who is coordinating their treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "They certainly will have a very miserable life if they continue
[conjoined]. They are as aware as anyone else of their limitations,"
he said. "They will not die, although they will not be very happy."</TE>
<TE>   The girls were brought to UCLA by Healing the Children, a Spokane,
Wash., group that matches volunteer medical personnel with children
from developing nations who suffer from serious, yet curable,
conditions.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital, which has never separated conjoined twins before,
has scheduled a preliminary procedure on the girls' scalp for Monday.
The actual separation, expected to take 10 hours, is planned for
mid-July.</TE>
<TE>   Both the twins are fully developed for 11 months, although Maria
de Jesus is slightly smaller than her sister.</TE>
<TE>   The ways in which they compensate for their limitation are
astounding. Their faces contort while they try to roll over in
opposite directions until one, usually Maria Teresa, wins out.
Because their connection limits their shoulder movements, they often
use their feet to grab things.</TE>
<TE>   The sisters are intelligent, doctors say. They vocalize and even
say a few words: mama, dada and agua. But their consciousness of each
other remains a mystery to outsiders. Even when the girls look into
mirrors, they can't see each other's faces, which are angled 120
degrees apart.</TE>
<TE>   They have distinct personalities and desires. "Both are very well
developed. Both are very independent human beings," Lazareff said.
"That doubles the responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   One will cry while the other is calm, and one will sleep while the
other is awake. Their mother said Maria Teresa is the playful one and
Maria de Jesus is shyer, quietly observing.</TE>
<TE>   Every aspect of caring for the girls--diapering, cuddling,
feeding--requires two people. Otherwise, when they cry, "I can only
hold one and the other has to wait by herself," Quiej-Alvarez said.
During bathing, one girl has to be held upside-down while the other
is in the tub.</TE>
<TE>   Their hearts are the same size, which indicates that neither pumps
blood for both of them. Tests have showed that the twins share less
than 10% of their brain tissue. As a result, they have an equally
good chance of not only surviving surgery, Lazareff said, but of
achieving full mobility and intellectual growth.</TE>
<TE>   Other tests, however, confirmed Lazareff's biggest worry. Each
sister has a major vein in the front of her head that drains into the
back of the other's head. During the separation surgery, doctors will
block off these veins and hope that other blood vessels can pick up
the slack. If things don't go well with that procedure, the girls
might suffer strokes and brain damage, or die. There are other
complications. Once they are separated, the rectangular areas that
have connected the sisters will lack skin and will have little dura
mater, the spongy tissue found under the skull that protects the
brain from damage and injury. Artificial material will be inserted to
replace the dura mater during the main surgery in July. But without
enough skin to close the wound, Maria Teresa and Maria de Jesus could
be vulnerable to serious infection.</TE>
<TE>   So, Lazareff enlisted the help of Dr. Henry Kawamoto Jr., a
specialist in craniofacial reconstructive surgery. On Monday,
Kawamoto is scheduled to implant a deflated balloon, like the kind
used in breast reconstruction, just under the skin on each side of
the twins' shared skull. During the next three weeks, doctors will
inject the balloons with saline to stretch the skin, the way the skin
of a woman's stomach stretches during pregnancy, Kawamoto said. The
skin flaps will also grow hair, although slightly thinner than
before.</TE>
<TE>   After the balloons are put in, the twins' heads will swell at the
fused area, making them resemble extras on the set of a sci-fi movie,
but Kawamoto said it will not be painful. He worries, however, that
the twins could develop bed sores from resting on the balloons. A
UCLA occupational therapist is designing a doughnut-shaped pillow to
ease the pressure.</TE>
<TE>   The physicians predict that skull tissue will grow to close the
gap, but they will consider grafts of bone tissue later if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Next month, the main separation surgery will require four surgical
teams--two reconstructive, two neurosurgical--to work on the
children. "It has to be choreographed," Kawamoto said.</TE>
<TE>   For the twins' mother, the weeks of waiting for the surgery have
been the most time she's spent with her daughters.</TE>
<TE>   No one had expected twins, much less conjoined ones. Quiej-Alvarez
said she was in labor for eight days at home before a midwife
recommended that she go to a nearby clinic. There, she delivered the
twins, who weighed 4.4 pounds together, by Cesarean section.</TE>
<TE>   She and the babies were sent to a hospital far from home. After
recovering, Quiej-Alvarez returned to her village and the babies
remained in the neonatal intensive care unit. Until recently, they
were restricted to formula because they could not sit up to swallow
safely. (At UCLA, nurses prop the babies up to feed them strained
foods.)</TE>
<TE>   In Guatemala, Quiej-Alvarez and her husband made regular
pilgrimages to visit the girls. They would ride a bus for six hours
and walk an additional hour and a half to the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   They were allowed to enter the twins' room twice a day for 15
minutes at a time. Afterward, they would go home, because they had no
place to stay.</TE>
<TE>   The founder of Healing the Children, Cris Embleton, said
transporting children to the United States for treatment usually is
not as efficient as taking care to them in their own countries. But
the separation and recovery of the twins require the kind of
expertise available only at an institution like UCLA. For this case,
the group needed to find "doctors with extremely high skills," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lazareff has made several trips to Romania to treat children
suffering from conditions such as brain tumors or spina bifida. After
he heard about las dos Marias, as he calls them, his calls prompted
UCLA's Mattel Children's Hospital to donate its services.</TE>
<TE>   It's not easy to plan a trip for such unusual travelers. The twins
have individual passports, and in the passport photos it's impossible
to tell that they are conjoined. Naomi Bronstein, co-founder of
Healing the Children, purchased Velcro tape to hold the children down
during takeoff and landing of their charter flight to Burbank
Airport. It wasn't needed, however. Two seats were reclined to form a
safe bed for the twins.</TE>
<TE>   An ambulance brought the twins and their mother to UCLA. Nurses,
rarely confronted with infants who need a space four feet long,
quickly taped together two open-sided cribs.</TE>
<TE>   Now that she lives at UCLA with them, the mother has a firm
relationship with her daughters.</TE>
<TE>   "If they hear me leave, they cry and cry so I have to sneak out,"
she said. "And when I come in they scream, and they both want me to
hold them."</TE>
<TE>   It hasn't been easy. Every day, a steady stream of new
faces--doctors, nurses and reporters--comes to the babies' room.
Still, she is lonely without her husband, who stayed home to work,
and is tired of questions about her pregnancy and her personal life.</TE>
<TE>   The twins will stay at UCLA through their recovery, which could
take several months.</TE>
<TE>   No matter what happens, Dr. Michael Karpf, vice provost of UCLA
Hospital Systems and director of UCLA Medical Center, said he knew he
had made the right decision in approving the surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "They're two distinct personalities," he said. "They deserve a try
at being themselves."</TE>

<HD>Unions Ready to Fight L.A. Breakup Plans</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Organized labor, a muscular force in Los Angeles politics, kicks off
a fierce campaign today against San Fernando Valley and Hollywood
secession, a battle that union leaders consider crucial to preserving
hard-won gains for workers.</LD>
<LD>   The breakup proposals headed for the Nov. 5 ballot are rife with
unknowns for Los Angeles' 35,500 city employees, most of them union
members. With cost savings a major goal of secessionists, unions are
concerned that new cities in the Valley and Hollywood would try to
slash payrolls by contracting out jobs or trimming salaries and
benefits.</LD>
<LD>   Secessionists downplay the uncertainty, pointing to safeguards
that--at least initially--would protect union jobs. They also predict
that the new cities would eventually negotiate contracts that both
sides could support. Still, labor organizers fear that workers will
only stand to lose.</LD>
<TE>   Beyond the municipal work force, unions throughout Los Angeles
County are lining up to fight secession, concerned that the new
cities would do away with rent control, living-wage ordinances and
other protections now on the books in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Over and over again, we've been able to introduce progressive
legislation in Los Angeles. That may not be the case in a new city,"
said Miguel Contreras, head of the Los Angeles County Federation of
Labor, AFL-CIO, an umbrella organization with 810,000 members
including janitors, teachers, longshoremen and film and TV crews.</TE>
<TE>   The federation's might in local elections comes from its huge pool
of voters and volunteers and a healthy campaign treasury, although
the group has suffered its share of defeats at the polls. Its ground
offensive against secession begins today with a rally at Los Angeles
Valley College.</TE>
<TE>   Almost 250,000 of the federation's members are registered voters
in Los Angeles, Contreras said. A Times exit poll showed that 31% of
the voters in last year's mayoral election came from union
households.</TE>
<TE>   Even if they live outside the city and can't vote, thousands of
union members are expected to pitch in as volunteers, forming an army
of foot soldiers ready to walk precincts and staff phone banks. The
unions also plan to spend more than $1 million on the anti-secession
drive.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been talking to our members for well over a year on this,
and I have yet to find a city worker who thinks [secession] is a good
idea," said Julie Butcher, general manager of the Service Employees
International Union's Local 347, which represents 9,000 city workers.
The city's police and firefighter unions also oppose secession.</TE>
<TE>   Labor's political power looms large in a city noted for low voter
turnout in municipal elections. Local unions have helped elect a
number of candidates, including Council President Alex Padilla.</TE>
<TE>   "Unions will mobilize not just [their] members, but families and
friends of members," said Daniel J.B. Mitchell, a UCLA professor of
management and public policy. "They're a cohesive force in the city
where there aren't many."</TE>
<TE>   But labor has yet to show it can deliver a citywide race. In the
mayoral contest, the county federation backed former Assembly Speaker
Antonio Villaraigosa. Despite a $1-million push by unions,
Villaraigosa still lost to James K. Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   The stakes for labor could be even higher in the secession
campaign, especially in the Valley, where the independence movement
is supported by some business interests that are often at odds with
unions.</TE>
<TE>   If secession wins, the terms of the breakups will protect all city
jobs during a one-year transition and require the Valley and
Hollywood to honor existing labor contracts. But those agreements
expire in either 2003 or 2004. After that, Los Angeles employees
transferring to the Valley or Hollywood would have to negotiate new
contracts, possibly with city councils less sympathetic to labor.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists point out that the unions would face a similar round
of negotiations with Los Angeles anyway. "It's the same process that
goes on every few years in Los Angeles," said Richard Close,
president of the secession group Valley VOTE. "No one has any
guarantees."</TE>
<TE>   In Hollywood, union workers would feel more secure in a new city,
said Gene La Pietra, leader of the area's breakaway effort.</TE>
<TE>   "If any part of L.A. could be said to be the union capital of
L.A., it would have to be Hollywood,"' La Pietra said. "This is a
movie-making town. Hello!"</TE>
<TE>   No city employees would be transferred against their will to the
new cities. But if a slimmed-down Los Angeles finds itself with a
glut of workers, layoffs could follow, according to the state
commission that put secession on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Just as troubling to the unions are claims by some secessionists
that labor costs have gotten out of hand.</TE>
<TE>   "Unions don't recognize the fact that the overall job is to
deliver services at low costs," said Studio City attorney David
Fleming, a prominent secession backer and chair of the Economic
Alliance of the San Fernando Valley. If unions demand high
compensation for subpar service, he said, a new Valley city would
have an obligation to taxpayers to find cheaper labor, perhaps by
contracting with Los Angeles County or private firms.</TE>
<TE>   Such possibilities cast a long shadow of uncertainty over Los
Angeles firehouses, police stations, parks and maintenance yards.</TE>
<TE>   At the city's North Hollywood machine repair shop, a dozen men in
blue overalls gathered on the oil-spattered concrete floor to
criticize secession. These workers spend their days skittering under
15-ton asphalt pavers to patch hydraulic leaks and rolling to the
rescue of street sweepers that bust drive shafts. A few years ago,
Local 347 finally got them city uniforms and a laundry service so
they could stop stinking up washing machines at home with their
diesel-soaked shirts.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I had a job that was going to carry me through to my
pension," said Eric Guzman, a 49-year-old welder who repairs heavy
equipment.</TE>
<TE>   But he has only seven years on the job. If voters approve a
breakup, Guzman said, he could be cut loose.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of people with more seniority," he said. "I'm on
the bottom of the totem pole now."</TE>
<TE>   The workers bristled at the notion that their pay and benefits
could be too generous. Fleming, for example, has said a Valley city
could save money by scaling back retirement benefits for new hires.</TE>
<TE>   "Sounds like he's just trying to fill his pocket and take away
from us," said Frank Flores, a mechanic. "The rich always try to take
away from the poor."</TE>
<TE>   In the event of a breakup, police and firefighter pensions would
be especially vulnerable. Their retirement fund, separate from that
of other city workers, has no reciprocity deals with other funds.</TE>
<TE>   That means that unless Los Angeles amends its charter, workers not
yet vested in the pension plan could not transfer to another city
without losing a chunk of their savings. About 5,100 police officers
and firefighters aren't vested, which typically requires 20 years of
service.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists say public safety workers should rest assured.
Supporters of an independent Hollywood say they plan to contract with
the city's fire and police departments. Valley breakaway advocates
say a new city might hire more police officers and firefighters than
currently serve the area. But some secessionists are skeptical about
other city services.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's face it," Close said. "The municipal unions are part of the
problem. They control the City Council. Luckily, there are a lot more
people in the Valley who are concerned about quality of life in the
Valley rather than city employees' pension plans."</TE>
<TE>   The secession camp has some union supporters. Benny Bernal, a
union member who is also on the board of Valley VOTE, said chopping
Los Angeles into three cities would benefit workers.</TE>
<TE>   The 38-year-old bus driver, a lifelong Valley resident, was on a
lunch break after driving giggling elementary students to the La Brea
Tar Pits. Unlike now, Bernal said, council members in a new city
would pay attention to his northeast Valley neighborhood and unions
would care less about power and more about their members.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not the only one who feels this way," he said as a union
buddy nodded in agreement. "Problem is, most members are afraid to go
public."</TE>
<TE>   His union, SEIU's Local 99, opposes secession. Its president,
Janett Humphreys, sent letters and held meetings informing
members--many of them part-time workers who earn, on average, $20,000
a year--that a split could jeopardize job security and raise taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Bernal, who is considering running for a seat on a Valley city
council in the secession election, said he has met with dozens of
union workers who are devising a benefits package to pitch to a new
Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   "I have extended family all over Los Angeles," said Bernal, a
father of six whose wife also drives a bus. "I have to look out for
everyone. I wouldn't support this if I thought it would hurt one
person."</TE>

not lost jobs.</CP>

<HD>'Awesome' Wildfire in Arizona Could Grow to 300,000 Acres</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SHOW LOW, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>A forest fire that has amazed firefighters with its ferocity
continued to spread untamed Friday through the ponderosa pines of
eastern Arizona's high country, forcing 5,000 residents to flee and
reducing more than a dozen homes to their foundations.</LD>
<LD>   Temperatures at the front of the blaze are so extreme that 80-foot
trees "are bursting into flames even before the fire reaches them,"
said Jim Anderson, who works at Apache Sitgreaves National Forest,
which is being mauled by the blaze. "We're not just seeing flames
shooting up 400 feet, but balls of gas that are rising in the smoke
columns and, when they finally get enough oxygen, exploding in flames
at 2,000 feet."</LD>
<LD>   George Leech of the U.S. Forest Service flew over the fire to map
its march and said its behavior was extraordinary. Rising plumes of
superheated smoke collapsed at higher, cooler altitudes, creating
ground-level windstorms that drove 1,000-foot flames horizontal
across the forest floor, he said. "It was awesome."</LD>
<TE>   The Rodeo fire erupted Wednesday on a heavily wooded Indian
reservation and within a day grew to 48,000 acres; by Friday
afternoon it had enveloped 130,000 acres--nearly as large as the
massive Hayman fire near Denver that has bedeviled firefighters for
two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   A companion fire in Arizona, burning in a parallel direction about
10 miles west of the Rodeo blaze, has consumed 16,000 acres since it
started Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   About 3,500 people in its path have been evacuated; about 5,000
residents have fled the Rodeo fire, said Brenda Clark of the Navajo
County sheriff's office.</TE>
<TE>   Fire officials worry that if the two fires combine--a likely
possibility given the dynamics of the larger blaze creating its own
low-pressure system--the conjoined blaze would quickly grow to
300,000 acres.</TE>
<TE>   About 90 residents in the fires' paths have refused to leave their
homes, Clark said.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the larger blaze has skirted about six miles from Show
Low's west side and was being blown north by winds. Fire officials
say that if winds shift easterly, the fire will head directly toward
the 7,700 residents of this town--named after a poker game that
resolved which of two settlers could remain here. Today's winds are
forecast out of the southwest at 25 mph, with single-digit humidity.</TE>
<TE>   In three days, the fire has spread about 25 miles, blackening a
swath across one of Arizona's most precious sights--a ponderosa pine
forest uncluttered by underbrush, making its mountain grasses
especially popular among hikers, horseback riders and mountain
bikers.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, both fires were burning northward, where a mix of
pinyon, junipers and heavy brush will provide less volatile fuel. If
it blows eastward toward Show Low, it would have to march through
limestone canyons, where bulldozers worked Friday to clear land of
dry vegetation.</TE>
<TE>   Leech said the canyons would not be a big hurdle for the raging
blaze, and if they are breached, about 11,000 people living in Show
Low and neighboring communities would be evacuated.</TE>
<TE>   The two fires were the most active Friday among huge blazes in the
West, but not the most threatening.</TE>
<TE>   The Missionary Ridge fire, about 10 miles north of Durango in
southwestern Colorado, grew to 60,000 acres and burned 14 more homes
Thursday night, officials said. Earlier, 33 homes were destroyed and
more than 1,700 others evacuated. Heavy rain Friday afternoon slowed
the fire's progress.</TE>
<TE>   Near South Fork, Colo., 70 miles east of Durango, the Million fire
had burned 8,000 acres and destroyed 11 homes.</TE>
<TE>   And in the nation's largest blaze, firefighters southwest of
Denver tried to capitalize on a second consecutive day of mild
weather to better contain the 137,000-acre Hayman fire.</TE>
<TE>   It has destroyed at least 79 homes and has forced 8,900 people to
flee the area.</TE>
<TE>   But fire crews are gearing up for an expected onslaught of wind
and dry air this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "We've taken a lot of the snort out of this fire over the last two
days," said Steve Frye, who is commanding the fire crews on the
southern half of the Hayman blaze. "We've swung the momentum in our
favor at least for the last couple of days.</TE>
<TE>   "That will allow us to nail down a large portion of open fire
line. It will allow us to withstand the weather threats of the next
few days."</TE>
<TE>   Crews had cleared fire lines around about 45 miles of the blaze's
100-mile perimeter. It continued to burn unchecked in unburned parts
of its midsection.</TE>
<TE>   Friday night, firefighters were told that a van carrying fire
personnel had crashed along Interstate 70 near Parachute, Colo.,
killing four people. Colorado State Patrol spokesman Don Moseman said
the van was from La Grande, Ore., and was carrying 11 people. The
other seven passengers were injured, two critically.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the accident was under investigation, but Moseman
said it appeared that the driver was distracted or possibly was
reaching for something inside the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   The two larger Colorado fires have been declared a national
emergency by President Bush, and on Friday, Arizona Gov. Jane Dee
Hull asked for a similar designation.</TE>
<TE>   For now, fire strategists said they had enough personnel to battle
the Rodeo fire because so much of it was burning out of control,
racing through forests made brittle dry by the worst drought in
Arizona in 125 years.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,000 firefighters were working to contain the quieter,
older edges of the fire, but the front of the blaze was too hot to
attack with hot-shot crews, Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   "Even flames just 4 feet high are too dangerous to be attacked by
firefighters," he said. Instead, 21 bulldozers worked on the fire's
flanks, and fire retardant and water were dropped on the taller
flames by 11 firefighting aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Over the coming days, as many as 2,000 firefighters are expected
to arrive in Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   If this town was tense over the prospect of evacuating, the
anxiety was palpable among homeowners who already fled and don't know
if they have homes to return to.</TE>
<TE>   One video, made by a resident who got past fire lines, showed the
fire's capriciousness in reducing some homes to ashes while leaving
other homes unscathed.</TE>
<TE>   Car salesman Gordon Hillman was bitter that he was persuaded to
evacuate his home in an hour's time and learned later that legally he
could have refused.</TE>
<TE>   "An hour after the first evacuation notice, they came by and said
it was mandatory that I leave, and I pulled away with my 24-foot
trailer only half full," he said. "I could have gotten a lot more
stuff."</TE>
<TE>   He assumes his three-story forest chalet, with wood siding and
cedar roof shingles, has been destroyed--along with his prize
possession--a 1934 Ford street rod.</TE>
<TE>   The home was so enveloped by the forest, he said, that his back
porch was built with a hole in it to accommodate a 60-foot-tall pine.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, who has worked at the national forest for four years,
said he dreaded not just the destruction of homes, but the loss of
wildlife habitat.</TE>
<TE>   Most of Arizona's 35,000 elk live in this forest, he said. "And
there are deer, antelope and a high concentration of Mexican spotted
owl.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a beautiful forest. I've seen the tree where Teddy
Roosevelt carved his initials when he rode through here.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to have a 300,000-acre hole in our ecosystem,"
Anderson said. "I'm going to go home tonight, sit in my chair and
cry."</TE>

<HD>Promise of Ventura Era Disappears Into Oblivion</HD>
<DH>Politics: The Minnesota governor was often his own worst
enemy. Many are disappointed in him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. PAUL, Minn.</DL>
<LD>On Gov. Jesse Ventura's inauguration day, the resplendent Capitol
rotunda here became a theater of populism not seen at such a level
since the election of Louisiana Gov. Huey Long in 1928.</LD>
<LD>   A young mother in her "My governor can beat up your governor"
T-shirt stood near a man who worked the night shift at a gas station,
who was standing not far from an unemployed truck driver, who was
looking across the room at Ventura's movie pal Arnold Schwarzenegger.</LD>
<LD>   Not everyone there that day had voted for the former pro wrestler.
But nearly everyone seemed downright tickled that a loud-mouthed
muscleman who favored pink feather boas and effeminate sunglasses in
the ring had rolled state politics onto its back.</LD>
<TE>   Three and a half years later, that crazy magic is so far gone that
when Ventura announced this week he would not seek reelection, many
Minnesotans thought it was one of the wisest decisions he has made as
governor.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Passe was the unemployed truck driver at the Capitol on
Jan. 4, 1999, there with his wife and infant daughter. He's employed
now, has a second baby girl and is a political observer so astute
that he can name Ventura-backed bills and tell you how far they got
in the state Legislature--not very far, usually.</TE>
<TE>   On inauguration day, Passe, then 38, who had voted Republican for
20 straight years, had this to say: "They had their chance. Now it's
his."</TE>
<TE>   This is how Passe feels now: "I was hoping to get an outsider in
there," he said this week. "He wasn't really an outsider. He turned
out to be mostly personality, and his personality got in the way of
any effectiveness. I'm disappointed."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura was elected in a fascinating upset. A Reform Party
candidate whose only political experience was as the mayor of a
Minneapolis suburb, he refused to hold his tongue or read from a
script as he spoke to mostly young, disenchanted voters. Show up on
election day, he implored them at college campuses and on what was
then a groundbreaking political Web site, and show career politicians
that you really are fed up with their ways.</TE>
<TE>   They did just that. Sixty percent of voters turned out in
Minnesota on Nov. 3, 1998, the highest figure of any state. About 15%
of them were people who, under state law, were allowed to register
and vote the same day, many of them males under 30. Ventura defeated
two established politicians--Norm Coleman, the Republican mayor of
St. Paul, and Hubert H. Humphrey III, the Democratic state attorney
general and son of the late vice president--by taking 37% of the
vote.</TE>
<TE>   His inauguration party lasted several days, cost a maximum of $20
to attend and featured a teenage blues-rocker.</TE>
<TE>   Although he enjoyed what appeared from the outside to be a
two-year honeymoon, Ventura began upsetting people here right away,
including many who shared his views.</TE>
<TE>   He bolted the Reform Party for the Independence Party. He set up
what analysts agree has been a well-oiled administration, but he
handed almost all the important posts not to fellow independents but
to more experienced Democrat and Republican operatives.</TE>
<TE>   Not a single independent candidate has been elected to statewide
office since, and many onetime supporters think his inability to
fulfill his own dream--a viable third party--has been Ventura's
greatest failure.</TE>
<TE>   He derided organized religion. He made millions moonlighting as an
author, a football commentator and a pro wrestling referee.</TE>
<TE>   He seemed to leap at the chance to go on high-profile national
television programs but handed out press passes to local reporters
that read "Official Jackal."</TE>
<TE>   And what began to make it all come apart, some here say, was that
while he beat up on others endlessly and with apparent glee, the
hulking former Navy SEAL couldn't take a verbal punch himself.</TE>
<TE>   "He really has quite thin skin," said Alan Frechtman of Minnesota
Public Radio, who works with humorist Garrison Keillor.</TE>
<TE>   On his weekly show "A Prairie Home Companion," Keillor provoked
Ventura mercilessly with such lines as, "You couldn't pour water out
of a boot if the instructions were written on the heel."</TE>
<TE>   Instead of playing along, however, Ventura ridiculed perhaps the
last man Minnesotans like to see ridiculed, the folksy, bespectacled
and beloved Keillor.</TE>
<TE>   "Garrison was actually light-hearted," Frechtman said. "But the
governor didn't see it that way. I think if he would have played
along, a lot more people would have found him endearing."</TE>
<TE>   The more Ventura complained and hit back, the more people piled
on. And they too started taking off their gloves.</TE>
<TE>   At a rock show this week benefiting local groups that favor
abortion rights, it was difficult to find anyone with a nice word for
Ventura, even though he has been an outspoken advocate of abortion
rights.</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Shaw was at the show during a visit to her hometown. The
31-year-old grade school teacher moved to Arizona last year, "but I
was here for most of the pain," she said of Ventura's tenure. "The
rest I heard about. When I move back next May, this place will be
Jesse-free."</TE>
<TE>   Al Wires, the lead guitarist for a local band called Faux Jean,
was hardly more forgiving. "It's been an embarrassment," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Most Minnesotans give Ventura credit for pushing through a
light-rail plan for the Twin Cities, a novel property-tax reform
package and a few other bills. The thing pretty much everyone liked
most was the tax refunds he gave for three years--until the state ran
out of money.</TE>
<TE>   But politics can be a nasty business, and in the end, Ventura
decided one turn was enough for him.</TE>
<TE>   After three years of mocking other state politicians, he proposed
a tough, lean, and what many analysts saw as a completely viable
budget to address the economic slowdown here. The Legislature instead
passed its own budget, perhaps the political blow that dropped the
governor.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura is a dedicated family man, and his wife wasn't happy with
his run the first time around. By most accounts she staunchly opposed
a second.</TE>
<TE>   The man who reveled in the fame and show business of it all at the
same time complained repeatedly about his personality and family
getting more attention than his budget proposals.</TE>
<TE>   And following reports that his son had trashed the governor's
mansion during parties when mom and dad were away, Duluth political
scientist Craig Grau said Ventura appeared to move up the
announcement that he wouldn't run again, from late in the week to
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Most here say it would be a difficult race but that Ventura would
almost certainly stand a chance of winning a second term against a
deeply divided field of potential candidates. Even more, it seems,
say he made the right decision.</TE>
<TE>   "He wasn't the best governor, but he wasn't the worst," said
Passe, the truck driver. And then, echoing his inauguration day
sentiments of 1999, he added: "I guess it's time to give someone else
a shot."</TE>

<HD>Solo Act Doesn't Beat Ortiz</HD>
<DH>Angels: Right-hander surrenders his league-leading 24th
home run, but Anaheim defeats Brewers, 11-4.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>When the All-Star game is held here at Miller Park on July 9, Angel
right-hander Ramon Ortiz might be invited to participate.</LD>
<LD>   In the home run derby.</LD>
<LD>   Ortiz leads the majors in home runs allowed, and he added to that
total Friday night by surrendering his 24th, but the Angels still
beat the Milwaukee Brewers, 11-4.</LD>
<TE>   So despite the home run, his performance brought a smile to his
face, to the face of his manager, Mike Scioscia, and to many of his
teammates.</TE>
<TE>   With the combination of an overpowering fastball, a sharp curve, a
deceptive changeup, masterful control, unwavering focus and flawless
timing, Ortiz has become the Angels' top pitcher, those home runs
nothing more than faint blemishes on his shining record.</TE>
<TE>   Take Friday, for example.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Ortiz gave up a third-inning home run to catcher Robert
Machado in front of 20,289. But Ortiz also pitched seven strong
innings in the opener of a three-game series. He gave up two runs and
five hits, striking out seven and walking one to improve to 8-5, his
victory total leading the team.</TE>
<TE>   The high home-run total hasn't hurt Ortiz because 19 of the 24
he's surrendered have come with the bases empty.</TE>
<TE>   Machado's home run, the first hit given up by Ortiz after retiring
the first seven batters, was a solo shot.</TE>
<TE>   So were the four home runs Ortiz gave up last week against the
Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   "The solo shots don't mean anything," said Angel outfielder Garret
Anderson. "It means he's throwing strikes, not walking guys. That's
when you get in trouble, when you walk guys. Solo home runs? I
couldn't care less."</TE>
<TE>   Mention of the home run brought a smile to Ortiz.</TE>
<TE>   "One home run is OK," he said. "Three? Four? Omigosh."</TE>
<TE>   Now in his sixth big league season, Ortiz is more than halfway to
last season's 13 victories, the most in his career. He says his
success begins not with his arm, but with his head.</TE>
<TE>   "I have good focus, good concentration," he said. "I don't
overthrow anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Catcher Bengie Molina, sees the difference.</TE>
<TE>   "In years' past," Molina said, "he always worried about the last
pitch. This year, he's calm even after he gives up a home run."</TE>
<TE>   It helped Friday, of course, that Ortiz had strong backing. In
all, the Angels collected 12 hits, highlighted by home runs from Brad
Fullmer, his eighth, and Troy Glaus, his 14th.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels scored runs in the second and third innings, and blew
the game open in the fourth with five more; the seven runs coming off
starter Ruben Quevedo (3-6).</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't hurt the Angels to be playing a bad team that has hit a
low this week. Last in the NL Central at 26-47, the Brewers lost
outfielder Geoff Jenkins this week when he slid into third base at a
bad angle, dislocated an ankle and damaged ligaments. He's out at
least two months.</TE>
<TE>   That forced the Brewers to play Matt Stairs on Friday night even
though he has yet to fully recover from a hamstring injury. His
slowness afoot was evident.</TE>
<TE>   For the Angels, the timing couldn't be better. Having hit a bump
in their race for the AL West title by losing four in a row, they
salvaged the last game of three against the St. Louis Cardinals on
Thursday and began a stretch of eight games over seven days against
two last-place teams Friday. After two more against the Brewers, the
Angels will play five in Texas against the Rangers, last in the AL
West.</TE>
<TE>   Friday night, the Angels attacked with balanced hitting. Anderson,
Glaus, Fullmer, David Eckstein and Darin Erstad each had two hits.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia reserved special praise for Anderson, who is hitting
.309. His manager called him, "the best kept secret in the league."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, however, wasn't buying into that.</TE>
<TE>   "That's up to other people to say stuff like that," he said. "I'm
not going to parade myself around."</TE>
<TE>   Told that it merely meant he had been extremely consistent lately,
Anderson, modest to a fault, replied, "I don't know what you've been
watching."</TE>
<TE>   One thing Anderson won't dispute is that he has been watching home
run ball after home run ball sail over his head with Ortiz on the
mound.</TE>
<TE>   And, strangely enough, enjoying the view.</TE>

final decisions are made in the stands, not on the field. The Angel
manager knows it's often a popularity contest. And, with his team in
the middle of the pack in attendance with an average of 22,919 at
Edison Field, the votes haven't been there for his players.</LD>
<LD>   "The teams drawing well have more impact," Scioscia said. "Most
fans vote at the ballpark. Maybe some of our players are not getting
enough consideration and maybe the fans are not in tune, but, within
the baseball world, our players get the proper consideration."</LD>
<LD>   The Angel getting the most consideration for this year's All-Star
game, which will be played here at Miller Park on July 9, is Troy
Glaus, who is fifth in balloting among third basemen. With 248,482
votes, Glaus, who began Friday's game hitting .250 with 13 home runs
and 52 runs batted in, trails the leader, Shea Hillenbrand of the
Boston Red Sox, by 146,000 votes.</LD>
<TE>   Ask Scioscia who else deserves consideration, and, like any loyal
manager whose team is having a good year, he rattles off a list of
names, singling out Troy Percival, Tim Salmon, Darin Erstad, David
Eckstein and Garret Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of guys get squeezed out," he said. "I don't know why they
don't just make it 35 guys on each team."</TE>
<TE>   He might not be saying that if he had to manage such a team.
Nearly four full lineups jammed into nine innings? Talk about getting
squeezed out.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Utility man Shawn Wooten, recovering from a strained muscle on his
right side suffered on May 31, worked out before Friday's game and
aggressively ran the bases. The Angels hopes to give Wooten, who
reports no pain, a rehabilitation assignment by next week.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels hadn't faced the Brewers since Milwaukee left the
American League following the 1997 season. The Angels were 178-167
against the Brewers before they switched leagues, 83-89 on the road.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder/infielder Clay Bellinger was outrighted off the Angels'
40-man roster Thursday. Right-handed pitcher Bobby Jenks was
transferred from double-A Arkansas to Class-A Rancho Cucamonga.</TE>

Washburn says he has lost count of how many friends and relatives

Brewers.</TE>

time, for the first time. In the two previous meetings (2000 and

although tied for first in the Southern Division with Georgia and
Orlando, comes here on a three-game losing streak. The Cobras have
used three quarterbacks this season: Connell Maynor has been
released, and both John Fitzgerald and Aaron Sparrow could play
tonight. The Avengers, third in the Pacific Division, have lost their
last two games at home. It will help if offensive specialist Chris
Jackson, who sat out last week's 68-61 victory at Grand Rapids
because of a sore hamstring, is fit to play. Jackson and Greg Hopkins
form one of the league's best receiving tandems.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reliever Gabe White was hospitalized Friday with a major infection in
his pitching hand, leaving the Cincinnati Reds without a left-hander
in their bullpen.</LD>
<LD>   White got a small infection on the side of his left hand, possibly
the result of an insect bite, and squeezed it to clean it out before
the Reds' 3-2 loss to the Seattle Mariners on Thursday night.</LD>
<LD>   White developed a fever and the swelling started to spread up his
arm overnight, so he was admitted to Good Samaritan Hospital for
intravenous antibiotics. Doctors also made a two-inch incision to
clean out the infection.</LD>
<TE>   "This is dangerous stuff," Dr. Timothy Kremchek said. "It's the
type of infection that could be limb-threatening or life-threatening.
If he had let this go, I'm convinced he could be in real trouble."</TE>

<HD>Brazilians Give English the Boot, 2-1</HD>
<DH>World Cup: Free kick by Ronaldinho catches goalie Seaman
off guard and is the game winner.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ULSAN, South Korea</DL>
<LD>So another World Cup ends in tears for England? Soccer fans from
Europe to South America to Asia all could have seen it coming, even
if David Seaman didn't.</LD>
<LD>   Seaman, the old man with the usually sure hands in front of the
English goal, froze on a long Brazilian free kick that might or might
not have been a shot, twisting around and stumbling backward as the
ball carried over his head and into the net to send England out of
the tournament Friday in Shizuoka, Japan.</LD>
<LD>   Seaman's gaffe--and it will go down as one of the most infamous in
England's World Cup history--enabled Brazil to break a 1-1 tie and
advance to the semifinals with a 2-1 triumph despite playing the last
33 minutes with 10 players.</LD>
<TE>   Ronaldinho, who had assisted on Brazil's equalizer three minutes
earlier at the end of the first half, lined up a free kick from about
35 yards out in the 50th minute and curled it high over the English
wall and across the mouth of Seaman's goal. Seaman, playing
dangerously off his line, appeared caught by surprise by the flight
of the ball--and before he could scramble back to save at the far
post, the ball was skimming the underside of the crossbar and into
the net.</TE>
<TE>   Three minutes earlier, during first-half stoppage time, Ronaldinho
took advantage of two missed English tackles in his half of the
field, dribbled into the heart of the England defense, spun defender
Sol Campbell around and fed the ball to Rivaldo, whose hard
left-footed shot eluded a diving Seaman inside the far post.</TE>
<TE>   England, which had taken the lead in the 23rd minute on a Michael
Owen goal and playing intelligently to protect it, had suddenly given
up two preventable goals in less than five minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The first Brazilian goal, according to England reserve defender
Gareth Southgate, "completely changed the flow of the game."</TE>
<TE>   But the second goal shattered it.</TE>
<TE>   Backup England goalkeeper David James said Ronaldinho's free kick
"shocked" his team.</TE>
<TE>   Right back Danny Mills took it one step further.</TE>
<TE>   "It killed us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   England was never the same, even after Ronaldinho was ejected for
a rough challenge on Mills in the 57th minute--when's the last time
the man of the match in a World Cup quarterfinal was red-carded?--and
Brazil was forced to play short-handed for the last 33 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   For Seaman, 38, the miscue was a nightmarish flashback to the goal
he gave up at the end of the 1995 Cup Winners Cup final, when he was
lobbed from just inside the midfield line by Real Zaragoza's Nayim,
costing Seaman's Arsenal club the championship.</TE>
<TE>   Seaman broke down after the whistle sounded on Brazil's victory.
He put his hands to his face and began sobbing, with teammate David
Beckham and England goalkeeper coach Ray Clemence rushing over to try
to console him.</TE>
<TE>   Seaman was still wracked with emotion when he faced the English
media.</TE>
<TE>   "The main thing," he said, fighting back tears, "is that I just
want to say sorry to the fans."</TE>
<TE>   Beckham then stepped to the microphone to defend Seaman. He said
if the fans and media tried to make Seaman a scapegoat for the
defeat, "it would be an absolute disgrace, because it wasn't his
fault. He is one of the best goalkeepers ... a world-class
goalkeeper."</TE>
<TE>   Seaman had saved England repeatedly in the early phases of the
tournament, bailing out defensive errors in front of him in the 1-1
tie against Sweden and preserving the 1-0 victory over Argentina with
several crucial stops.</TE>
<TE>   England Coach Sven-Goran Eriksson was more disturbed by his team's
inability to capitalize against a short-handed opponent during the
final 33 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe we were a little bit tired," Eriksson said.</TE>
<TE>   If anything, Brazil gained inspiration after Ronaldinho was
ejected.</TE>
<TE>   "The team spirit was not spoiled by that," goalkeeper Marcos said.
"It is something that happens, whether we like it or not."</TE>
<TE>   Said Rivaldo: "Our first priority after Ronaldinho's red card was
to avoid conceding another goal. We were able to do that and I'm glad
about that."</TE>
<TE>   Brazil Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, whose team next plays either
Senegal or Turkey in a semifinal, pointed out, "We practice with 10
men sometimes. People have asked me why I do this, but now you see
why."</TE>

<LD>Tim Kurkjian of ESPN The Magazine writes that a conversation took
place on a quiet bus many years ago: "Frank Robinson, one of the
greatest players ever, one of the most confident hitters of all time,
was asked how he had done against Bob Gibson in his career.</LD>
<LD>   " 'I hit him good,' Robinson said. Don Drysdale? 'Good,' he said.
Juan Marichal? 'Real good,' he said. Robinson was stopped by the next
question. What about Koufax?</LD>
<LD>   " 'No one could hit that man,' Robinson said."</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which pitcher holds the major league record for

<TE>   Where's Brandi? Ron Rapoport in the Chicago Sun-Times, commenting
on the World Cup: "As for marketing opportunities for U.S. players,
don't hold your breath. Some experts doubt any of them will be able
to do as well in that department as Brandi Chastain did just for
ripping off her shirt after the victory over China in the Women's
World Cup three years ago.</TE>

<TE>   Get with it: Filip Bondy of the New York Daily News writes that
it's time for Americans to appreciate soccer: "You don't have to be
afraid of soccer. Really. If you just go out and learn a few names, a
few rules, you'll become one of America's great experts.</TE>
<TE>   "Soccer isn't morally reprehensible, like boxing. It's not
exploitative, like women's gymnastics. It's not going to steal your
NFL Sundays. It won't wreck the Mets vs. Yankees. Soccer is a niche
sport in this country, like hockey or tennis or golf."</TE>
<TE>   Are they breathing? Skip Bayless of the San Jose Mercury News
laments that no one is seriously challenging Tiger Woods: "But just
once, you'd love to see a member of the Bridesmaid Brigade show a
little get-him-next-time irritation.</TE>

<HD>Even in Defeat, U.S. Came Out a Big Winner</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL CALIGIURI</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul Caligiuri, whose decisive goal against Trinidad and Tobago in
1989 propelled the United States into the World Cup for the first
time in 40 years, started every game for the U.S. in the 1990 and '94
World Cups. He made 110 appearances for the U.S. during his
international career. He played six seasons in the MLS, the last five
with the Galaxy, before retiring after last season to coach the men's
and women's soccer teams at Cal Poly Pomona.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   It's a shame that the best effort of the United States at the
World Cup will be remembered as a loss. The Americans outplayed a
three-time world champion, dominating possession and offense, but
could not score a goal.</LD>
<TE>   Coach Rudi Voeller says he's not happy with the way the Germans
are moving on to the semifinal, but he has to be very relieved. I've
been reading the German newspapers online and our "cowboys"--as the
German media had taken to calling the Americans--rode herd on his
team for most of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Bruce Arena chose to bring Frankie Hejduk back into the
lineup, sitting Josh Wolff, the only change from the Mexico game.
Arena listed five defenders and only one forward, Brian McBride, in
what could have been, or should have been, a 5-4-1 formation. The
U.S. never really played that formation, with Arena sending Landon
Donovan to play alongside McBride, as in previous games.</TE>
<TE>   Hejduk ran from the midfield and the U.S. spent 58% of the time in
the German end. Donovan had played well before, but Friday he played
to his full potential and was unlucky not to score. Claudio Reyna
also had his best match of the Cup. Unfortunately, so did German
goalkeeper Oliver Kahn, who, with the help of Torsten Frings'
dangling arm, kept all six of the American shots on goal out of the
net. Germany had only two shots on goal, both sizzling headers. One
scored and one bounded off the post. The danger came where I thought
it would, high balls served in from the wings.</TE>
<TE>   The game got extremely physical. Emotions ran high for more
reasons than this simply being a World Cup quarterfinal.</TE>
<TE>   Respect is a word overused and misused in sports. But having
played for six years in Germany, I had a pretty good idea what guys
like Hejduk, who faced three of his Bayer Leverkeusen teammates, and
Tony Sanneh, who plays for FC Nuremberg, were feeling. Add to that
the experiences of Donovan, Reyna and McBride, who moved on after
failing to win significant playing time in the German Bundesliga or
second division, and there was substantial emotional subtext.</TE>
<TE>   Germany has always been one of the hardest places for an American
player to establish himself. Because of that, this game would carry
great weight.</TE>
<TE>   While the Germans may respect the improving technical skill,
athleticism and work ethic of American players, they have never been
open to accepting them as full-blooded members of the international
soccer community.</TE>
<TE>   That might have changed Friday. Sanneh's last four matches are the
best of his career; his defense was impenetrable against some of the
world's best and he demonstrated rare skill in keeping possession and
moving the ball forward into the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, his stock has risen at Nuremberg. Hejduk also performed
well and will go back to Leverkeusen with his head held high.</TE>
<TE>   The American success--and this tournament was an unqualified
success--leads to hard questions about Major League Soccer stars such
as Donovan, DaMarcus Beasley, Clint Mathis, Eddie Pope and Pablo
Mastroeni. Any one of them may be coveted by the money leagues in
Europe. At the same time, American soccer needs to continue building
an identity and developing the next wave of players.</TE>
<TE>   It will be a collective effort from U.S. Soccer, MLS and groups
such as Anschutz Entertainment Group that are committed to see soccer
succeed. Somehow, 2006 doesn't seem all that far away.</TE>

<HD>Castillo Reaches Another Milestone</HD>
<DH>Baseball: In extending his hitting streak to 35 games, he
breaks the record for Latin players. Marlins defeat Tigers, 4-1.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>The Florida Marlins' fax machine rang only minutes after the game
ended. It was a congratulatory note from Benito Santiago, commending
Luis Castillo on his latest accomplishment.</LD>
<LD>   Castillo extended his hitting streak to 35 games, tying Ty Cobb
and two others for the 10th-longest in major league history, as the
Marlins defeated the Detroit Tigers, 4-1, Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   The streak also is the longest by a Latin player, surpassing
Santiago's 34-game streak in 1987.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel good because that record is important to me," said
Castillo, a Dominican. "I want it to keep going."</TE>
<TE>   Leading off the third inning, Castillo drilled a 2-0 fastball back
at knuckleballer Steve Sparks.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't getting the knuckleball over, so I had to go with the
fastball," Sparks said. "It's making so many headlines and getting so
much attention; you want to be the guy who stops it, but a lot of
pitchers have been saying that for the last couple of weeks. That's
what makes it so incredible."</TE>
<TE>   The ball ricocheted off Sparks' glove and rolled toward second
base. There was no throw.</TE>
<TE>   "I got a piece of it," Sparks said. "It felt like my glove turned
with it. I thought it would be closer to me. Obviously, with his
speed it was going to be tough to get him out anyway."</TE>
<TE>   It was Castillo's 18th infield single during the streak. Florida's
switch-hitting second baseman also singled and scored in the fifth,
giving him 17 multihit games during the span.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo already owns the longest streak by a second baseman,
eclipsing Rogers Hornsby's 33-game streak in 1922.</TE>
<TE>   Two other players had one-season streaks of 35 games--Cobb (1917)
and Fred Clarke (1895). George Sisler also had a 35-game hitting
streak, but it spanned two seasons (1924-25).</TE>
<TE>   Only nine players have had a longer streak, including two since
1950--Pete Rose (44) in 1978 and Paul Molitor (39) in 1987. Joe
DiMaggio set the record of 56 games in 1941.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo got a standing ovation after his hit, and the baseball
was taken out of play to commemorate the Latin record.</TE>
<TE>   "I see the ball very good," Castillo said. "I never feel like that
before."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Tejera (2-1) gave up two hits and a run in seven innings,
helping the Marlins win their fourth in a row. Tejera gave up a
second-inning home run to Brandon Inge but was almost flawless the
rest of the way. He retired seven of the last eight batters he faced.</TE>
<TE>   Braden Looper pitched a perfect eighth, and Vladimir Nunez picked
up his 17th save in 21 chances.</TE>
<TE>   The Marlins evened the score in the second on Charles Johnson's
RBI single. They made it 3-1 with a pair of runs in the fifth.
Castillo scored on Mike Lowell's double, then Lowell came home on
Derrek Lee's double.</TE>
<TE>   The Marlins tied a season high with six doubles.</TE>
<TE>   Florida scored its last run in the seventh. Eric Owens singled,
stole second and later scored on Cliff Floyd's base hit that also
sent Sparks (3-7) to the bench.</TE>
<TE>   Sparks gave up 11 hits and four runs in 6 1/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo finished two for four and improved to six for 12 against
knuckleball pitchers. He is four for eight against Boston's Tim
Wakefield.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not much more he can do for us," Marlin manager Jeff
Torborg said.</TE>

<HD>Germany's Coach Wasn't Sure He Would Survive This One</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ULSAN, South Korea</DL>
<LD>Rudi Voeller, Germany's coach, was immensely relieved to hear the
final whistle Friday. For much of the match he had lived in dread of
the United States coming back to tie and then defeat his team.</LD>
<LD>   "I am absolutely happy to reach the semifinals," he said.
"Although I am not quite happy about the manner in which we made it.
From the beginning we didn't play as I wanted us to play.</LD>
<LD>   "We withdrew too much into our own half. The U.S. put a lot of
pressure on us and we just didn't get the combination play going as I
would have liked."</LD>
<TE>   Still, the Germans are where they always seem to be every four
years, in the semifinals of the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "Prior to the World Cup, people didn't think we had a chance of
doing anything at the World Cup," Voeller said. "Some even thought
that we wouldn't even survive the group stage.</TE>
<TE>   "We proved them wrong and I'm happy to have done that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defender Gregg Berhalter was angry that referee Hugh Dallas saw
fit not to award the U.S. a penalty kick when the ball struck German
defender Torsten Frings on the arm when Frings was standing on the
goal line.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to be a sore loser, but that was a clear handball,"
Berhalter said, "and the referee should have given him a red card."</TE>
<TE>   The rules say, however, that no penalty should be given on
accidental contact.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This might have been Claudio Reyna's final game with the U.S.
national team.</TE>
<TE>   The American captain, tired of repeated flights from Europe to
World Cup qualifiers in North and Central America, isn't sure he
wants to commit to another four years of travel.</TE>
<TE>   "It's probably something I'll decide on in the next couple of
months," Reyna said after the loss to Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Friedel, the U.S. goalkeeper, also isn't sure whether he'll
return for another four years. Friedel, who got married during World
Cup qualifying last year, will be 35 in 2006 and recently signed a
new contract with Blackburn Rovers of the Premier League.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ulsan Munsu Football Stadium where Friday night's game was
played is named after nearby Mt. Munsusan.</TE>
<TE>   The coastal city's tourism bureau has a slogan that reads: "From
Sea to Land and Land to Mountain, No More Boring Trips."</TE>
<TE>   The same might be said of the U.S. team after this World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   German goal-scorer Michael Ballack praised the U.S. players for
taking the three-time world champions to the wire.</TE>
<TE>   "Those guys really put [pressure] on us," he said. "We had trouble
getting away from their tight defense. They were physically very fit
and ran for the entire 90 minutes. They deserved to be in the
quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   "Many people thought it was going to be an easy game, but the U.S.
has showed us what they are made of and proved to be a difficult
opponent."</TE>

<HD>Gamecocks Win, 10-2, to Earn Title Shot</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>OMAHA</DL>
<LD>Now South Carolina gets to play in the ultimate elimination game.</LD>
<LD>   The Gamecocks clinched a spot in the College World Series
championship Friday by defeating state rival Clemson, 10-2, a week
after opening the tournament with an 11-0 loss to Georgia Tech.</LD>
<LD>   "We like the city of Omaha, and after we didn't open very well we
were doing our best to extend our stay," Coach Ray Tanner said. "We
battled back the hard way and now we get a chance to play in the
national championship game. It's a tremendous feeling."</LD>
<TE>   The Gamecocks (57-17) defeated their state rivals for the second
time in three days and won their fourth elimination game in a row.
South Carolina will play Texas (56-15) for the national title today.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Bondurant (7-4) scattered eight hits and struck out seven
in his second complete game. He also got unexpected offensive help
from the bottom of the batting order. South Carolina's last four
batters--Garris Gonce, Brian Buscher, Landon Powell and Kevin
Melillo--combined to go nine for 18 with nine runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys at the top of the order just needed a little break. They
were saving all their hits for tomorrow, so we thought we'd pick them
up today," said Gonce, who was three for six with three RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   South Carolina had 13 hits and took advantage of three errors and
three wild pitches. The Gamecocks completed a 4-0 run through the CWS
that was made necessary after the loss to Georgia Tech in the opener.</TE>
<TE>   USC in 1998 was the last team to lose its opener and make it to
the title game. The Trojans won it by defeating Arizona State, 21-14.</TE>
<TE>   Clemson (54-17) opened the CWS 3-0 and needed to beat the
Gamecocks only once to advance to the title game, but couldn't do it
after going 3-1 against South Carolina during the regular season.</TE>

<HD>Gagne Gets Rave Reviews After Stopping Red Sox</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: Reliever dominates, striking out all four hitters
he faces for his 26th save in a 3-2 victory over Boston.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At this rate, the Dodgers are going to run out of superlatives to
describe closer Eric Gagne by, oh, the All-Star break.</LD>
<LD>   The starter-turned-reliever has been dominant all season, but
never more so than Friday night, when he struck out all four batters
he faced for his major league-leading 26th save, nailing down a 3-2
interleague victory over the Boston Red Sox before 46,719 at Dodger
Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   "The stuff he's featuring now is the best stuff I've ever seen,"
Dodger right fielder Shawn Green said. "He's throwing a 97-mph
fastball wherever he wants it. He could hit a gnat right now. And his
changeup moves so much he can throw it for strikes or in the dirt so
hitters will chase it. It's incredible to watch and fun to play
behind. I'm glad I don't have to face him."</LD>
<TE>   Trot Nixon, Doug Mirabelli, Lou Merloni and pinch-hitter Jason
Varitek had to face Gagne Friday night, and the most they could
muster were a few foul balls. Gagne needed only 18 pitches to dispose
of the Red Sox, including three to Varitek--who swung and missed
badly at each--to end the game.</TE>
<TE>   "That was just pure filth tonight," fellow reliever Jesse Orosco
said. "He's on top of his game, he loves what he's doing, and he's
doing it with confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Gagne lowered his earned run average to 1.17 and has held the
opposition to a .138 average (18 for 130). He has struck out 56 and
walked only four, one intentionally, in 38 1/3 innings. He has not
walked a batter since the ninth inning of a May 4 game against
Chicago, a span of 24 1/3 innings and 81 batters.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not just a guy who throws hard and is firing the ball to the
middle of the plate," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said. "It's 95-98 mph
and going corner to corner. When you throw 98 and have a changeup
with depth to it, so much so that other teams think it's a
split-fingered fastball, that's as good a changeup as you'll see."</TE>
<TE>   Said Boston starter John Burkett: "That's the best stuff I've seen
all year."</TE>
<TE>   Gagne, the 26-year-old right-hander who struggled as a starter in
2000 and 2001 before moving to the bullpen in spring training, thinks
it can be better.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to throw more strikes, I want to be perfect," Gagne said.
"I'd like to throw nine strikes every inning and get three strikeouts
and not have anyone hit the ball."</TE>
<TE>   The velocity of Gagne's fastball jumped from 94 mph to 98 this
season, thanks to a winter strengthening program and his quick
adaptation to the let-it-all-hang-out-for-one-inning mentality of a
closer. But the key to Gagne's success has been his 88-mph changeup.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone can hit a fastball," Gagne said, "but if you can keep them
off-balance with another pitch, it's tough to adjust to."</TE>
<TE>   Gagne's performance preserved the win for Hideo Nomo, who gave up
one run and five hits and walked four in seven innings to improve to
7-5, and helped the Dodgers to overcome a monster night by Red Sox
third baseman Shea Hillenbrand, who had two solo home runs, a double
and a single.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo wobbled in the third inning, walking the bases loaded with
two out, he walked another to put runners on first and second with
none out in the fourth, he threw 48 pitches in the two innings ...
and he hardly flinched.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo is tied for the National League lead with 55 walks, and he
once walked 16--yes, in one game--for the Kintetsu Buffaloes during a
191-pitch complete-game victory over the Seibu Lions on July 1, 1994.
So this was nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo shook off early control problems, striking out Brian Daubach
after shattering two of his bats to end the third inning and wiggling
out of the jam in the fourth. Nomo has not lost since May 12 at
Florida.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers got a key contribution from struggling third baseman
Adrian Beltre, who homered in the second inning, and a big hit from
diminutive center fielder Dave Roberts, whose two-out, two-run double
over the head of Daubach in left field gave the Dodgers a 3-0 lead in
the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Though Gagne saved Dodger victories the two previous nights, he
threw only 24 total pitches, so Tracy didn't hesitate going to him
again Friday. Four Boston batters later, it was, as Roberts said,
"Lights out."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Apparently, He Wasn't Fragile</HD>

<LD>If it wasn't the worst trade in Dodger history, it was certainly in
the top two, the 1993 deal that sent a young, skinny, supposedly
fragile pitcher named Pedro Martinez to the Montreal Expos for second
baseman Delino DeShields.</LD>
<LD>   While DeShields spent three undistinguished years in Los Angeles,
Martinez became one of baseball's most dominating pitchers, a
right-hander with a 95-mph fastball, a snap-hook of a curve, a wicked
changeup and three Cy Young awards. It had to make the Dodgers cringe
when they saw Martinez in the Red Sox dugout Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   Martinez, who struck out the first five batters he faced in
Thursday night's 5-0 victory over San Diego and will not pitch
against the Dodgers this weekend, has a much different perspective on
the trade.</LD>
<TE>   "Whenever I have a reason to smile about something in baseball, I
have to think about the trade, because that's the only way this would
have happened," said Martinez, who is in his 11th season and has a
140-61 career record, "I don't think I would have developed into the
pitcher I am. I would have been a closer."</TE>
<TE>   Martinez pleaded with then-manager Tom Lasorda to make him a
starter in 1993, but Martinez, then 22, couldn't crack a rotation of
Orel Hershiser, Ramon Martinez (his brother), Pedro Astacio, Kevin
Gross and Tom Candiotti.</TE>
<TE>   The right-hander went 10-5 with a 2.61 earned run average in 65
games that season, primarily as a middle reliever. He lost his only
two starts, to Colorado and Houston in September.</TE>
<TE>   With the Dodgers in need of a second baseman, Martinez having
undergone surgery on his left shoulder in 1992 and doubts among the
medical staff and front office that the 5-foot-11, 175-pounder could
withstand the physical rigors of being a starter, then-general
manager Fred Claire shipped Martinez to Montreal that winter.</TE>
<TE>   "Just let the numbers, my outings, dictate whether they were wrong
or not," Martinez said. "You can't blame them for trusting their eyes
and the odds.... I don't blame anybody. At the time, it was the
manager's decision and the GM's decision to trade me.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't even know who the scouts were who said I was too small.
Was it Dr. Frank Jobe? As much as he knows, as much as I respect him,
it's different when you pitch, when you go out and play the game. I
know how I feel .... They have to live with it. I don't."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dodger outfielder Shawn Green on his mental gaffe that allowed
Toronto's Raul Mondesi to score from second base on a one-out fly to
right in the Dodgers' 2-1 victory Thursday night: "I thought there
were two outs. I was very close to flipping the ball into the stands
before I heard people yelling. I was praying no one would hit a home
run to tie the game or put them ahead.... As long as it didn't affect
the game, I can laugh about it." ... Dodger right-hander Darren
Dreifort, continuing his rehabilitation from a second elbow
reconstruction surgery, threw 67 pitches in the bullpen Friday and
hopes to throw live batting practice by the end of the home stand.</TE>

<HD>Immediate Help Will Be Hard to Find</HD>
<DH>Ducks: Thin draft means team will have to find player it
can develop with No. 7 pick.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bailing water does take extra manpower. Such is the task Mighty Duck
General Manager Bryan Murray and Senior Vice President Doug Moss have
on their hands these days.</LD>
<LD>   Both are trying to upgrade their ends of the front office to keep
the team from listing.</LD>
<LD>   Most general managers have spent the last couple of months
preparing for this weekend's NHL draft and evaluating the free-agent
market, which opens July 1. Murray, who took over after Pierre
Gauthier was fired in April, has had to retool management personnel
as well.</LD>
<TE>   Moss, brought on board to handle the team's business side, has
also been in a hiring frenzy, as the Ducks and Angels--both owned by
Disney--will operate their business departments separately for the
first time. Both teams will have marketing directors, a job that was
handled by one person for both teams in the past.</TE>
<TE>   This will be a sink-or-swim moment for the Ducks ... again. They
were tied for 13th in the Western Conference last season, although
they were encouraged by their 15-13-2 record in their last 30 games.
The team's attendance, which has been in a free fall for four
seasons, ranked last in the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to get the fans back," said Murray, previously the
general manager in Detroit and Florida. "The only way to do that is
compete and be entertaining every night and win your share of games."</TE>
<TE>   Players selected by the Ducks in this draft, which will be held
today and Sunday in Toronto, probably won't provide immediate help.
The Ducks have the seventh pick in a draft that is considered thin
beyond the top four prospects--defenseman Jay Bouwmeester, left wing
Rick Nash, defenseman Joni Pitkanen and goalie Kari Lehtonen.</TE>
<TE>   As for free agency, Murray admits attracting a high-profile player
is unlikely because the Ducks finished so far out of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, who scored the second fewest goals in the NHL last
season, probably will try to sign players with offensive skills, size
and toughness. In the last two weeks, Murray has signed two of the
team's recent top draft picks, forward Alexei Smirnov and defenseman
Mark Popovic, and is negotiating with another, forward Stanislav
Chistov.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting a free agent will be difficult," Murray said. "The cost
of free agents is so extreme that you are better off drafting your
own players and developing them."</TE>
<TE>   The draft-and-develop approach has been the Duck mantra for nine
seasons. Yet the team has only two postseason appearances in that
time.</TE>
<TE>   Murray said he did not anticipate a big trade, so the moves that
he hopes will put the Ducks on the road to success will be more
behind the scenes.</TE>
<TE>   He is trying to bolster the scouting department and is expected to
hire Chuck Fletcher, Murray's assistant general manager with Florida,
as director of hockey operations.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Larry Rucchin, brother of Duck center Steve Rucchin, died Thursday
in Hamilton, Canada. He was diagnosed with cancer two years ago while
playing hockey in Germany. He was 35.</TE>

<HD>Rivals Wage South-of-the-Border War</HD>
<DH>Boxing: Morales, Barrera bring traditional animosities
into their featherweight championship bout.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>To fully comprehend the cultural implications of tonight's Marco
Antonio Barrera-Erik Morales featherweight championship fight and to
understand the severity of the insults hurled between the two Mexican
fighters, you need more than a weekend crash course at your
neighborhood Berlitz.</LD>
<LD>   Living south of the border for an extended period may broaden your
horizons enough to get a handle on the goings-on. So too might
studying up in pre-conquest history.</LD>
<LD>   The crib notes version: The fighters come from different, often
rivalrous, regions of Mexico, spawning racial tensions. There is also
a perceived class distinction, with Barrera coming from a
middle-class upbringing in Mexico City and Morales coming from a poor
area in Tijuana.</LD>
<TE>   The enmity between the two goes back before they met in their
first fight on Feb. 19, 2000, a hotly contested 122-pound bout in
which Morales (41-0, 31 knockouts) was awarded a split decision.</TE>
<TE>   Many have heard the story about Morales and Barrera getting into a
shouting match while playing a pick-up soccer game many years ago at
the Otomi training complex in the mountains above Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   But Morales' father, Jose, told a little-known tale of the two
fighters getting into a heated exchange while they were sparring.</TE>
<TE>   Barrera (54-3, 39 KO's), still angry about losing to Morales in
their first meeting, will not take the belt should he win tonight at
the MGM Grand Garden Arena. Morales is the reigning World Boxing
Council 126-pound champion.</TE>
<TE>   If Barrera does win, the WBC's two top-ranked
contenders--currently Injin Chi and Juan Manuel Marquez--would meet
for that organization's title.</TE>
<TE>   Should Morales successfully defend his belt, Arum is looking to
set up a bout for him with Paulie Ayala in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Barrera intimated he has to knock out Morales to get the win and
gain undisputed respect.</TE>
<TE>   "Fighting here in Las Vegas, this is Top Rank's house," Barrera
said of the competing promotion's home base. "I've trained to box
more but be more powerful because it's very hard for me to fight with
my mouth. For me, it's easier to speak with my hands."</TE>
<TE>   To take the fight, in which each will earn a guaranteed $1.5
million, Barrera insisted upon his name being listed first in the
promotion and to choose the gloves used, luxuries usually afforded
the champ.</TE>
<TE>   "That's fine; he can have all of that. I have him in the ring,"
Morales said. "He couldn't take the fact that I was starting to get
more famous than him, more well known.</TE>
<TE>   "He couldn't believe that someone who wasn't from Mexico City was
getting the attention that he was getting."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With the controversy that arose after the last fight's split
decision, a list of potential judges was presented to both camps for
approval. Having crossed off names that neither side wanted, Mike
Glienna of Illinois and Duane Ford and Chuck Giampa of Nevada were
appointed. Morales' camp signed off on Ford despite him scoring the
first fight, 114-113, in favor of Barrera.... Fighting on the
televised undercard will be top prospect Miguel Cotto (9-0, seven
KO's) of Caguas, Puerto Rico, and Justin Juuko (36-9-1, 26 KO's) of
Las Vegas, who are meeting in a scheduled 10-round lightweight bout.
Pedro Alcazar (25-0-1, 14 KO's) of Panama City, Panama, is facing
Fernando Montiel (23-0-1, 17 KO's) for Alcazar's World Boxing
Organization super flyweight title in a scheduled 12-rounder.</TE>

<HD>Galaxy Thinks Sky's the Limit</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Team, which plays Dallas tonight, is optimistic it
can sustain interest from the U.S. World Cup run.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alexi Lalas and Peter Vagenas were in their cars before 4 a.m.
Friday, driving to Staples Center to represent Galaxy players at a
party where some 600 people watched the U.S. team's World Cup loss to
Germany.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight, Lalas, Vagenas and the rest of the Galaxy will be at the
Rose Bowl to play the Dallas Burn as Major League Soccer begins life
after the U.S. team's historic run to the World Cup
quarterfinals--once again hoping a burst of interest can be
sustained.</LD>
<LD>   "Those of us who have been around long enough understand that when
the World Cup's involved, the circus comes to town, and then it
leaves. And that's OK," Lalas said. "You still have to capitalize on
the momentum and the attention that this incredible feat has brought
to soccer."</LD>
<TE>   Cobi Jones, the Galaxy midfielder who played for the U.S., was
tentatively scheduled to arrive back in Los Angeles today but isn't
expected to be in uniform until July 4 against San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to give him some time basically to recover, because it's
mentally and physically a pretty straining tournament," said Coach
Sigi Schmid, who postponed Friday's practice from 9:30 a.m. to noon
so players could watch the game. "He'll be with us for sure by the
Fourth of July."</TE>
<TE>   That July 4 game against the Earthquakes could be a big one for
the MLS in L.A., not only because of Jones, but also because of San
Jose's Landon Donovan, the 20-year-old forward who landed on the
cover of Sports Illustrated after the U.S.'s victory over Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   It might be a good idea to catch Donovan in the MLS soon. On loan
to San Jose from the German team Bayer Leverkusen, he will probably
return to Europe after the MLS season.</TE>
<TE>   Lalas--who played in the world's top professional league in Italy
after the 1994 World Cup--has experienced the lure of European
glamour and money as well as the comfort of playing at home.</TE>
<TE>   "We talk about things like keeping the stars here. It's easier
said than done," he said. "People want to see the players they saw in
the World Cup. It's difficult when you're competing with great
leagues around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Some players feel their future is in Europe, more power to them.
But there are some that really enjoy playing here in the United
States and value the league and understand that their commitment to
the league will enable soccer to grow here."</TE>
<TE>   Vagenas, a former UCLA star who played for the U.S. team that
finished fourth at the Sydney Olympics, witnessed how the
international stage broadens the game's audience.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously the World Cup's a grander scale," Vagenas said. "But
the Olympic team doing so well, it definitely caught the people's
imaginations. People still come to Galaxy games so they can see me
take a penalty kick, I've been told."</TE>
<TE>   It might be that the World Cup will help the MLS. But many contend
the MLS already helped the U.S. in the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no doubt it goes hand-in-hand," Vagenas said. "It's not
like all of a sudden we've birthed greater soccer players in America.
I think the fact they have somewhere to perform day-in and day-out
and play at the top level helps them get to that level."</TE>
<TE>   Lalas, Vagenas pointed out, played in the World Cup before he ever
played a professional game.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Lalas said, the MLS "has made kids that are 18, 19, 20 years
old into professionals.</TE>
<TE>   "And that's not just about kicking the ball. It's how you conduct
yourself on and off the field. It's how you prepare yourself mentally
and physically. It's things you can't get from playing a college
season or playing in a travel league.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obvious in the results--not just from the actual scores, but
from the way the U.S. team is playing--that MLS has been a critical
part of that."</TE>

<LD>Davis Love III put his preparation for the U.S. Open to good use
Friday in the Greater Hartford Open at Cromwell, Conn.</LD>
<LD>   Love shot a bogey-free six-under-par 64 in breezy afternoon
conditions for a share of the second-round lead with Briny Baird and
Jonathan Kaye at eight-under 132.</LD>
<LD>   "I spent three or four weeks getting ready for the U.S. Open,"
said Love, coming off a 24th-place tie last week at Bethpage Black.
"I'm tournament sharp and tough ... and a little bit mad.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a lot more relaxing golf course than last week. There's
nothing wrong with eight under leading the golf tournament. The fans
don't want to see guys putting for par."</TE>
<TE>   He holed a 27-foot birdie putt on the short par-four 15th after a
poor chip from the swale in front of the green, and made four other
birdie putts from 12 to 15 feet.</TE>

<HD>Another Feather in McCarron's Cap</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Hall of Famer wins All-Star championship at
Lone Star Park. With nine mounts left, he has a win total of 7,139.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Riding for the last time outside California, 47-year-old jockey Chris
McCarron won two races Friday night at Lone Star Park to clinch first
place in the National Thoroughbred Racing Assn.'s All-Star Jockey
Championship.</LD>
<LD>   After McCarron won the last of four races in the competition, he
and his 11 rivals squirted one another with water bottles in the
winner's circle. McCarron, thinking the horseplay was over, turned
his back and then someone emptied a bucket of water on him.</LD>
<LD>   Ending a career that started in 1974, McCarron will ride three
races today and six more Sunday at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<TE>   In his last race, he will be aboard Came Home, the favorite in the
$100,000 Affirmed Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   The two victories at Grand Prairie, Texas, on Friday boosted his
career total to 7,139, which ranks him sixth on the list. With a
victory worth 12 points, McCarron finished with 24 points to overtake
Edgar Prado, who had a win and a second-place finish and went into
the final race with 18 points. Prado's mount finished last in the
final race. Mike Smith and David Flores also won races and finished
in a tie for third place with 12 points apiece.</TE>
<TE>   The 12 jockeys in the competition had a combined total of more
than 50,000 victories and their mounts have earned $1.4 billion.
McCarron won the first race with favored Prized Amberpro, a
5-year-old mare who beat colts going six furlongs. McCarron looped
the field on the turn for home as Prized Amberpro beat Coat Of Armor
by a neck and paid $5.40.</TE>
<TE>   McCarron's mounts finished ninth and 11th in the next two races.
But in the finale he rode Yoto Speakes, an 8-year-old ghostly white
gelding who made up 3 1/2 lengths from the eighth pole home to win by
1 1/4 lengths. Yoto Speakes paid $17.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way you can even dream it'd work out this good,"
McCarron said. "That would be awful greedy. I think this will make it
much more difficult on Sunday. But I've made up my mind. The
adrenaline through the stretch [with Yoto Speakes] was unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   McCarron has never found a track where he couldn't win. Since
breaking in on the Maryland circuit, he has been at the top of the
game. As a teenager, he rode 546 winners in 1974, breaking the record
of 515 that was set by California-based Sandy Hawley in 1973.</TE>
<TE>   That might have been a tough act to follow, but McCarron was up to
all the encores. Having conquered Maryland, he shifted to the big
leagues of Southern California in 1978 with nary a blip. His horses
have earned a record $264.1 million. He was a first-ballot inductee
into the Racing Hall of Fame in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   A week ago today, as McCarron puts it, he "pulled the plug." He
announced that Sunday's card at Hollywood Park would end his career.
When he first discussed the details surrounding his retirement
announcement with his wife, McCarron suggested that Friday night at
Lone Star would be a suitable forum for the windup.</TE>
<TE>   "Chris," Judy McCarron said, "you've just got to have your last
ride at Hollywood Park."</TE>
<TE>   McCarron agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I was beginning to lose my desire," McCarron said before Friday's
races. "My enthusiasm for the job had begun to wane. I had told
myself several years ago that if that ever happened, I would get out.
To go on wouldn't have been fair to my clients [horse owners and
trainers], the public or myself. With guys like Gary Stevens, Laffit
Pincay, Eddie Delahoussaye and Kent Desormeaux to go up against every
day, it's difficult to compete even when you've got your head screwed
on 100%."</TE>
<TE>   McCarron was to have ridden Ask Me No Secrets in today's Vanity
Handicap, but the filly is ill and wasn't entered. In Sunday's
Affirmed, McCarron will be reunited with Came Home. He has ridden the
colt in all eight of his races, including a victory in the Santa
Anita Derby and a sixth in the Kentucky Derby in the last two starts.
Gobi Dan, Kamsack, Tracemark, Fonz's, Calkins Road, Laffit, and True
Phenomenon are also entered in the Affirmed, which McCarron first won
with Journey At Sea in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   McCarron has said that it's unlikely he'll move on to a training
career.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to take a rest," he said. "I'm tired. Not tired
physically, but tired mentally."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Azeri gets better with every start for trainer Laura De Seroux and
the family of the late Allen Paulson.</LD>
<LD>   The best female main track runner in the country--and it isn't
even close--is having to carry more weight as the Grade I victories
continue.</LD>
<LD>   Seeking her fourth consecutive victory in a Grade I in today's
$250,000 Vanity Handicap at Hollywood Park, Azeri will carry 125
pounds, meaning she will be spotting her four opponents from 8-13
pounds.</LD>
<TE>   The weight assignment is three more than she carried in her
victory in last month's Milady Breeders' Cup Handicap at Inglewood,
eight more than when she won the Apple Blossom at Oaklawn Park on
April 6 and 10 more than she carried when starting her win streak in
the Santa Margarita Handicap at Santa Anita on March 10.</TE>
<TE>   If she wins for the seventh time in eight starts, the 4-year-old
daughter of Jade Hunter will become the highest-weighted Vanity
winner since Paseana carried 127 in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Her main rival is Affluent, who has been the runner-up in the
Apple Blossom and Milady and who has lost three in a row for trainer
Ron McAnally after winning three consecutive graded stakes.</TE>
<TE>   Starrer, making her first start for trainer John Shirreffs after
running 11 times for Dave Hofmans, Collect Call and Terna will also
run.</TE>
<TE>   Long before the Vanity, Johannesburg will make his first start
since his predictable nowhere finish in the Kentucky Derby, against
Caller One and 14 others in the Golden Jubilee Stakes, a Group I, at
Royal Ascot in England.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The fifth at Hollywood Park is a 5 1/2-furlong
race for older fillies and mares and the race is the final leg of the
Churchill Downs simulcast network pick four. The other races in the
sequence are Churchill Downs' 10th, the 12th from Calder and the
ninth from Arlington Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Voodoo Dancer. The classy Kingmambo filly will try for
her eighth victory in 13 starts in the $150,000 Locust Grove Handicap
at Churchill Downs.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: The field in today's second at Stockton. The eight
Arabians are seven for 95.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using McAdam, J.T.'s Song,
Expresso Bay and Calcupbound in the sixth, singling Top Honours in
the seventh and American Pastime in the eighth and Confess, War
Surgeon, Hit The Big Time, Brown's Champion and Demon Bob in the
ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners (through Thursday): Previous day/meet total: 3/113. Money:
Previous day/meet total: $18.20/$662.80. Total money bet: $722.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rod Barajas drove in the winning run with a bases-loaded grounder in
the bottom of the ninth inning, leading the Arizona Diamondbacks to a
4-3 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays on Friday night at Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   Quinton McCracken had three hits, including an opposite-field
single off Toronto closer Kelvim Escobar (3-4) to lead off the ninth.</LD>
<LD>   After two walks and a groundout, McCracken scored on Barajas'
grounder to third when Eric Hinske's throw hit him in the back as he
neared home plate.</LD>
<TE>   Byung-Hyun Kim (3-0) picked up the victory with a perfect ninth
inning, baffling Darrin Fletcher and Felipe Lopez with called third
strikes after handling a hard shot to the mound by Raul Mondesi for
the first out.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 9, New York Yankees 1--Rookie Oliver Perez, at 20 the
youngest player in the major leagues, won again in only his second
big league start as the Padres defeated David Wells and the Yankees
in a rematch of the 1998 World Series at San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Wells (7-5), who won the opener of the Yankees' sweep in '98, gave
up the first three runs. Ramiro Mendoza gave up four in the seventh,
including a three-run double by Wiki Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   Perez (2-0), who beat Seattle on Sunday in his major league debut,
gave up one run and six hits, struck out three and walked five.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco 4, Baltimore 3--David Bell hit a tiebreaking home
run with two out in the bottom of the eighth inning at San Francisco
and the Giants won their third in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Bell hit his 10th home run of the season on a 2-0 pitch from
reliever Rick Bower (3-3).</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 3, Cleveland 1--Brad Wilkerson scored the go-ahead run
from second on Wil Cordero's sacrifice fly in the sixth inning at
Montreal as the Expos won their eighth in a row. Montreal is on its
longest winning streak since tying a franchise record with a 10-game
winning streak in 1997. The Expos are 7-0 on their current homestand
and have won eight consecutive home games.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 3, Chicago White Sox 2--Rafael Furcal drove in the winning
run with a bunt single in the eighth inning and the streaking Braves
pulled off another unlikely victory, defeating the White Sox at
Atlanta. Todd Ritchie (4-9) was charged with all three Atlanta runs,
despite giving up only two hits in 7 1/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   New York Mets 4, Kansas City 3--Tony Tarasco hustled home from
second base when the Royals misplayed Mo Vaughn's two-out infield
single in the bottom of the ninth inning and the Mets won at New
York. The Royals lost their eighth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 5, Cincinnati 3--John Mabry hit a two-run homer and an RBI
single at Cincinnati, leading the Athletics over the Reds. Miguel
Tejada also homered as Oakland earned its fifth consecutive victory
and its 13th in 14 games.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 3, Minnesota 0--Brandon Duckworth and two relievers
combined on a four-hitter at Philadelphia to lead the Phillies over
the Twins. Tomas Perez, playing for the injured Scott Rolen, had an
RBI single and pinch-hitter Jason Michaels had a sacrifice fly.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 8, Houston 0--Jamie Moyer gave up three hits and struck
out 11 in seven innings at Houston, and Ruben Sierra hit a grand slam
to lead the Mariners past the Astros. The Mariners won their fourth
in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 2, Pittsburgh 0--Kenny Rogers limited the Pirates to four
singles in seven innings and Ivan Rodriguez hit his first homer of
the season, leading the Rangers at Pittsburgh. Rodriguez, sidelined
by a herniated disc for seven weeks before returning June 7, drove in
both Texas runs with a solo homer in the fourth and an RBI double in
the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 8, Tampa Bay 7--Larry Walker hit an RBI double during a
four-run rally in the ninth inning at Denver, then singled home the
winning run for the Rockies with two out in the 10th.</TE>

<HD>Re-Signing Boucher Top Priority</HD>
<DH>Kings: Defenseman would become unrestricted free agent July
1. Taylor says they're not close to agreement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While preparing for this weekend's NHL draft in Toronto, King General
Manager Dave Taylor also had several other matters to address.</LD>
<LD>   No. 1 is trying to come to terms with defenseman Philippe Boucher,
who if not signed by the end of next week will become an unrestricted
free agent July 1. He is expected to draw interest from other teams,
driving his price higher.</LD>
<LD>   Taylor also has held preliminary talks with Felix Potvin's agent
about extending the goaltender's contract. If the Kings exercise
their option on Potvin's current deal, as Taylor said they will,
Potvin will be eligible for free agency next summer unless the two
sides agree on an extension in the next 12 months.</LD>
<TE>   Having signed highly regarded forward prospects Jared Aulin and
Yanick Lehoux over the last two months, Taylor is hoping to reach a
deal with Russian left wing Alexander Frolov, generally considered
the club's top prospect, before July 15. If not, Frolov won't be
eligible to join the Kings until the 2003-04 season.</TE>
<TE>   One thing Taylor won't have to concern himself with is formulating
a competitive bid for a big-ticket, soon-to-be unrestricted free
agent such as Bill Guerin of the Boston Bruins, Bobby Holik of the
New Jersey Devils, Tony Amonte of the Chicago Blackhawks or Teemu
Selanne of the San Jose Sharks.</TE>
<TE>   Any of the four would fill the team's glaring need for a
top-of-the-line forward, but the budget-conscious Kings are not
interested.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not looking for a quick fix," President Tim Leiweke said,
"and we're not going to go out and ultimately throw our economics out
the window."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings hope that one or more of their young prospects--Aulin,
Lehoux, Frolov or Mike Cammalleri, who is contemplating giving up his
final year of eligibility at the University of Michigan--can crack
their lineup next season.</TE>
<TE>   Trades, of course, are always a big part of draft weekend, and
Taylor said the Kings will listen to offers.</TE>
<TE>   They hold the 18th, 50th and 66th picks in what is considered the
weakest draft in several years, and Taylor said they'd be interested
in trading up only if they could land one of the top five or six
picks.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a number of teams call with interest in our prospects at
the trade deadline [in March], but less so at this point," Taylor
said. "I suppose if the right deal was available, we'd consider
moving a prospect. It's difficult to gauge how these prospects will
turn out, but we'd like to give them the opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   As for locking up Boucher, who made $582,000 last season, Taylor
said the Kings have exchanged proposals with the defenseman's agent,
Pat Brisson, but "we're not really close at this point."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings seem to feel even less urgency regarding Potvin, who
posted a career-best 2.31 goals-against average last season while
establishing a club record by playing in 71 games.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor said that, if nothing else, the Kings will exercise their
$3.3-million option on Potvin's contract before the June 30 deadline.</TE>
<TE>   They have yet to offer Potvin an extension proposal, though
Potvin's agent, Jay Fee, said he expected to see one before the end
of the month.</TE>
<TE>   "Felix's view is that we're open to looking at a long-term
proposal now from the Kings," Fee said. "If we get in a situation
where they exercise the option as he approaches free agency, then
it's a little different dynamic....</TE>
<TE>   "When you get closer and closer to unrestricted free agency, I
think the clubs understand that players are more than likely going to
test the free-agent waters."</TE>

<LD>This is the one thing the rest of the world had on us. They
grudgingly admitted that we were dominant when it came to military,
cultural, political and economic matters, but they were always smug
with the knowledge that football (soccer), the one thing they are

<LD>   Much to their chagrin, this World Cup has knocked out this last
bastion of arrogance. The U.S. team has proven that while they might
not be among the elite of the elite (Brazil, Germany) they certainly
have evened things up and have shown the world that they can compete
with anyone now.</LD>

one room cheering for one team, feeling great about your country and

<TE>   The beautiful performance of the U.S. soccer team in the World Cup
warrants an official apology by your writer, Grahame Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Jones has ridiculed and berated U.S. soccer for years. In case
you missed it, please select any of his past articles at random. I
guarantee that it will include criticism of the U.S. players, the
national team coach, the Galaxy or anything else that could be called

<TE>   After witnessing the U.S. soccer team's incredible and historic
run over the past three weeks (ending with the disappointing 1-0 loss
to an outplayed German squad), I was dismayed to find Alan
Abrahamson's cynical commentary on the future of soccer in this
country in Friday's paper.</TE>
<TE>   Was it really necessary to print Abrahamson's disparaging view
precisely on the morning of the U.S.'s most important match in its
history? Couldn't you simply have allowed the U.S. soccer community
to enjoy a few weeks of overachieving glory without having to read
the misguided opinion of a soccer dad whose expertise on the sport
seems based on 5-year-olds "chasing butterflies or [looking for]
four-leaf clovers?"</TE>

<TE>   After reading Alan Abrahamson's commentary, I have come to one
conclusion. If a sport doesn't include influence peddling or a
judging and doping controversy to write about like his beloved
Olympics, it's not worth it.</TE>
<TE>   Loosen up, Alan, the World Cup is just like the Olympics--every
four years you can actually take time away from your indifference as
most Americans do with track and swimming (which are largely ignored
by fans--and the media--the other three years and 50 weeks).</TE>

<TE>   I'm a Mexican woman, married to an American, and therefore just as
happy to see either soccer team win the World Cup. However, the
American team deserves an apology from Mexico. Yes, I agree there was
a penalty in favor of Mexico that was not called by the referee, but
that did not justify the shameful behavior of the Mexican players.
They showed a total lack of class and sportsmanship.</TE>
<TE>   I went from rooting for Mexico to being happy they lost. From now
on, the USA team will have my support every time they face my
country.</TE>

<LD>I enjoyed Ross Newhan's article extolling the virtues of Dodger
Stadium. However, he failed to mention one major source of its charm:
its name. It's not Farmer John Stadium, it's not Union 76 Stadium,
it's not even Fox Stadium ... yet. I'm not sure how and why this is.
I'm just thankful that it's so.</LD>

<TE>   I understand that Dodger fans can't help but buy into the
overblown hype about their baseball facility at Chavez Ravine. Since
their earliest days, they have heard Dodger Stadium referred to as
the "Taj Mahal" of ballparks by every Angeleno media outlet. But if
they really took an objective look at that clay-covered infield and
wiped the Tommy Lasorda, blue-blooded propaganda from their eyes,
they would see it is just an average yard.</TE>

<TE>   She can only counter weakly with the likeness of Brett Butler, on
a wall that is bordered by a 2-foot-high fence a T-baller could homer
over, and bleachers covered with an awning that looks like it was
fabricated at Home Depot.</TE>
<TE>   Like the great old hotels in Vegas, Dodger Stadium's days of glory
are past and the kiss of the wrecking ball is well overdue.</TE>

<TE>   It's good to hear that the Dodgers' Kevin Brown is feeling better
after recent back surgery. However, his comment on the prospect of
returning to the rotation this year--"If this is what the Lord has
planned for me, I'll do everything I can to take advantage of it"--is
one more athlete's ludicrous reference to God.</TE>
<TE>   I can just see God sitting up there, sorting through the issues of
terrorism, starvation, disease, etc., and asking, "Let's see, should
I let Kevin Brown come back this season or not?"</TE>
<TE>   Kevin, the only plan is that the Dodgers continue to overpay you.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I fail to understand the ongoing debate about Phil Jackson's coaching
abilities when it's obvious that Red Auerbach is absolutely right in
his criticism. Without the current Laker roster, Jackson would be
nothing.</LD>
<LD>   But why stop with Jackson when history is replete with examples of
men whose success was due to other people's efforts? Sir Laurence
Olivier did fairly well at that soliloquy thing, but if he hadn't had
a supporting cast to play the other roles he'd have been booed off
the stage. Abe Lincoln just got lucky in having Grant, Sherman and
the rest of the Union Army behind him or little Bobby Lee would have
kicked his butt all the way back to Springfield. Charles Lindbergh
was called "the Lone Eagle," but he didn't change his own oil, and
Babe Ruth never would have even come to bat if he'd been forced to
play all nine defensive positions.</LD>
<LD>   Now that all those frauds have been exposed, I have only one
question. What was Red Auerbach's free-throw percentage when the
Celtics were winning their NBA championships?</LD>

<TE>   It is hard to say this, but after watching the Lakers' victory
parade, Chick Hearn needs to retire. He has done a great job
throughout the years, but during the celebration he acted and came
across as someone who can't do the job. Missing players and talking
angrily as if the mike wasn't on when receiving instructions are
signs that retirement should happen.</TE>
<TE>   I hope that in my profession as a pastor, someone would tell me if
I made such obvious mistakes that took away from all the good work I
had accomplished. Sorry Chick, but, for your own legacy, retire while
we can enjoy all the good you've done!</TE>

<LD>At a time when baseball fans are running away from the game in
droves, Donald Fehr had an opportunity to bring some respectability
back to the game of baseball and he blew it. I can't believe Fehr is
against random testing of his players for steroids in the name of
privacy. Hey, Donald, if privacy is such a big concern of yours, just
throw out all drug testing while you're at it. Bring back Steve Howe
and Dwight Gooden and Darryl Strawberry.</LD>
<LD>   And didn't Pete Rose bet on the Reds privately? Why not pass out
cocaine in the locker rooms along with the chewing gum and sunflower
seeds while you're at it. And watch those homers fly!</LD>
<LD>   I feel so sorry for all former baseball fans like myself who once
knew how great baseball used to be and have watched it be reduced to
a boring game whose team rosters change every year. Get with the

<LD>Great. Another victory for the politicians that "represent" Los
Angeles. Mark Ridley-Thomas and other enlightened members of the City
Council are again playing the Coliseum card, further delaying the
return of the NFL, if it returns at all.</LD>
<LD>   Let's check the scorecard. The Anschutz group rolls out a plan for
a state-of-the-art stadium that, like Staples Center, would
revitalize downtown and get fans excited again. Plus, league
officials have made it clear that the Coliseum is no longer a viable
NFL option. Yet, Ridley-Thomas and his drones continue to block a
great venture with the Coliseum Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, we're all aware of that stellar tradition that the
Coliseum Commission is striving to uphold. Over the years they've
succeeded in chasing away the Lakers, Kings, Bruins, Rams and
Raiders. Can't figure out why the NFL wouldn't be beating down the
door to deal with this group of Mensa candidates all over again.</LD>

<HD>Defending Champion Stewart Wins Pole at Sonoma</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SONOMA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Tony Stewart, buoyed by his first Winston Cup road race win at Sears
Point Raceway last year, came back Friday in one of Joe Gibbs'
Pontiacs to win the pole with a time of 93.476 mph in qualifying for
Sunday's Dodge/Save Mart 350K.</LD>
<LD>   "That wasn't bad," Stewart said of his run over the two-mile,
10-turn course set among the rolling hills of Sonoma Valley's
vineyard country.</LD>
<LD>   Stewart said his biggest problem was adjusting to the track's new
configuration, which included new grandstands and the elimination of
the track's drag strip as part of the road-racing course.</LD>
<TE>   "It was hard to find braking points with all the scenery changes,"
he said. "There used to be a bridge that I used as a gauge. The
bridge is gone and I about drove off the course the first lap hard
through there.</TE>
<TE>   "I was like, 'Where is my bridge at?' Other than that, the car ran
just as good as it did last year here."</TE>
<TE>   It was the first pole for Pontiac since April 2001 when Bobby
Labonte was fastest at California Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Busch (93.184) and Jeff Burton (93.166) were second and third
quickest, both in Jack Roush Fords. Three-time winner Jeff Gordon was
fourth, in the fastest Chevrolet at 93.141.</TE>
<TE>   Qualifying is one thing, running 112 laps is quite another,
Stewart said.</TE>
<TE>   "Sunday you have to make sure you're not overdriving the race
car," he said. "You can't run qualifying laps lap after lap or you're
going to wear your tires out and you're going to wear the brakes out.</TE>
<TE>   "Momentum is the important thing. It's so different here than at
the ovals where we usually run. When you go to an oval you're talking
about thousandths of a second. Here you're talking about tenths of a
second.</TE>
<TE>   "Every corner that you run, there is an opportunity to gain time
on somebody or lose time on somebody. But if you can get in that
rhythm and your car is driving good at a place like this with it
being as hard to pass, sometimes it is a little bigger an advantage
than at some of the ovals."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart plans to drive a sprint car tonight in a U.S. Auto Club
race at Altamont Speedway, east of Oakland, about 75 miles from here.</TE>
<TE>   What will Gibbs, owner of Stewart's Winston Cup team, think about
that?</TE>
<TE>   "We don't tell him," Stewart said, grinning. "We have learned it
is much easier to ask Joe for forgiveness than permission."</TE>
<TE>   Dale Jarrett, who had to change engines because of an oil pump
problem, did not try to qualify but will start in the rear.</TE>
<TE>   Jarrett was still excited about taking batting practice with the
San Francisco Giants on Tuesday night wearing uniform No. 88--his car
number.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how hard they were actually throwing, but it was too
fast for me," said Jarrett. "I sure got a better appreciation of how
talented these guys are at that level."</TE>

<HD>Boos Long Gone, Lowe Starts to Feel Good</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Derek Lowe has gone from bullpen to rotation, from boos to cheers,
from dreading going to the ballpark last year to reporting several
hours early this year, when he is the first-half favorite for the
American League's Cy Young Award that usually goes to Roger Clemens
or Boston Red Sox teammate Pedro Martinez.</LD>
<LD>   Lowe, who faces the Dodgers today with an 11-2 record and
league-best 1.85 earned-run average, also has gone from something of
a one-pitch closer who was so inconsistent last year that he would
wear his warmup jacket before games to hide his uniform number from
hooting Fenway Park fans (as if that alone could disguise his
6-foot-6 frame) to a four-pitch starter spotting his sinker, curve,
changeup and cut fastball almost at will.</LD>
<LD>   "He's reached the point where the team expects to win when he goes
out there," Manager Grady Little said. "He's getting to be the same
kind of pitcher, taking on the same kind of role, as Pedro."</LD>
<TE>   Revitalized in spirit and personnel, the Red Sox have the best
record in baseball. They have emerged from a divisive and traumatic
2001 season in the same way Lowe has, regaining what he calls his
"quirky and left of center" persona.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't call him flaky," catcher Jason Varitek said. "I'd just
say he's a left-hander in a right-hander's body."</TE>
<TE>   There was Lowe, all 78 inches, displaying some Mark Madsen moves
in accompaniment to the meringue sounds booming from the clubhouse
stereo in San Diego as he stood at his locker, bouncing through an
interview.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just very laid back," he said. "I don't take too many things
seriously. Through the course of a season, I'll do a lot of dumb
things that you normally see only a left-hander do. It's who I am."</TE>
<TE>   Lowe might be a maturing 29, but what pitcher hasn't forgotten
about the runner on second base and gone into a full windup, allowing
the runner easy access to third, and what pitcher hasn't delivered a
pickoff throw to first, forgetting his first baseman was in normal
position and not holding the runner?</TE>
<TE>   Potentially more damaging--and admittedly dumber--was a high
school incident in which Lowe, a touted pitching prospect expected to
be a high draft choice out of Dearborn, Mich., tried to dunk during a
pickup basketball game and ripped up his hand on a rusted rim.</TE>
<TE>   The sufficiently healed Lowe was eventually selected by the
Seattle Mariners in the eighth round of the 1991 draft and had worked
his way through the Mariner system to reach the majors in 1997, when
he and Varitek were traded to Boston for Heathcliff Slocumb in a deal
that evolved into a steal for the Red Sox.</TE>
<TE>   Varitek, once named to the all-time college team by the
publication Baseball America, became the regular catcher in a lineup
that includes former Georgia Tech shortstop and teammate Nomar
Garciaparra.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe, after appearing in 63 games in 1998 and saving 15 in 74
appearances in 1999, tied for the league lead by registering 42 saves
in 2000, when he also pitched a flawless inning in the All-Star game.</TE>
<TE>   As to what happened last year, hindsight isn't always 20-20.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Lowe didn't prepare well enough, thinking it wasn't
necessary for a closer who usually works one inning at a time.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe he relied too much on a fastball that isn't overpowering,
fearing criticism if he got beat with a secondary pitch.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe he still yearned to start, as he had done in the Seattle
system, and which he admits to having yearned for even amid his
closing success of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the reason, 2001 went bad from the start.</TE>
<TE>   He drew the loss on opening day and the loss in the third game.
Instead of dwelling on the positives of 2000, Lowe said he obsessed
on the losses and became something of a "mental wreck."</TE>
<TE>   "The saddest thing about it is that we're blessed and honored to
play in the major leagues," Lowe said. "When you dread coming to a
major league stadium, you know you've hit rock bottom. They booed me
in Boston from the time I got to the park until I went home. I
couldn't wait to go on the road. I knew that if I gave up a hit on
the road, at least somebody would be cheering me.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a year I thought would never end."</TE>
<TE>   Lowe blew six of 30 save opportunities and suffered 10 losses. No
other American League reliever lost more.</TE>
<TE>   He would eventually spend time with a sports psychologist, but the
turning point didn't come on a couch.</TE>
<TE>   It came on the mound, when Lowe received the opportunity to start
three otherwise meaningless games in September and responded, giving
up only two runs and 12 hits in 16 innings.</TE>
<TE>   It was a building block, a confidence boost, the job he wanted.</TE>
<TE>   "Those three starts," he says now, "were almost enough to erase
the previous five months."</TE>
<TE>   They were certainly enough to put Lowe to work in the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   "I ran more, lifted more, studied more, took it more seriously
than I ever have," he said. "The booing stuck with me. The failure
drove me.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I was better, and I wanted people in Boston to be able to
say that I had the courage to come back, that I didn't just fold my
tent."</TE>
<TE>   Lowe has pitched a no-hitter against Tampa Bay and a near
no-hitter against Baltimore. He has restricted opposing batters to a
league-best .186 average. Left-handed batters, who had hit .288
before this season, are hitting .193 and unable now to lean in
because of refinements in his cut fastball, which enables Lowe to
pitch inside against them.</TE>
<TE>   "Location, location, location," Varitek said. "As a starter, he
can throw a wider variety of pitches, and he's simply become more
confident and consistent with them. It all starts with his ability to
command the fastball.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't throw as hard as Pedro, but he has more movement.
Pedro is a strikeout, fly-ball pitcher. Derek is a ground-ball
pitcher. His infielders know they're going to be active. His record
speaks to how good he's been and how good his supporting cast has
been."</TE>
<TE>   The efficiency of Lowe's sinker is illustrated by the fact he has
given up only two home runs in 97 1/3 innings. He also leads the
league in ground-ball-to-fly-out ratio and, by inducing 15 double
plays, shares the lead in that category with Kenny Rogers of the
Texas Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   Life is a learning experience.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, at 23, Lowe was arrested on a domestic violence charge
involving his then girlfriend and now wife, Trinka. He went through
five months of counseling, the record was expunged, and Lowe has said
that he deeply regrets an incident that has not been repeated.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, he said, the learning experience of last year, when he
"tended to treat every batter as if he was Babe Ruth," should work
for him as he approaches what he called "the uncharted water" of the
second half.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really just a matter of being able to be more creative as a
starter," he said, "and at 29, when people say you should be coming
into your prime, I can do things that I've never been able to do
before, as far as pitching to both sides of the plate and sinking and
elevating pitches."</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox are still in the pitching market, but Lowe's emergence
is reflected in their record and their league-leading pitching
statistics. In addition, with Martinez's physical status still
tenuous to a degree, Lowe is critical to their continued success.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always said that Pedro is still our ace and I'm third
[behind Martinez and John Burkett] in a line of five guys," Lowe
said. "To be an ace, you've got to do it for a few years and win the
big games. Pedro has three Cy Young awards and has won in the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "I was at rock bottom and now I've dug out and can show my face
without people screaming negative things. I couldn't have predicted
or asked for a better start, but at this point that's all it is, a
start."</TE>
<TE>   As a left-hander in a right-hander's body, however, Lowe is
someone the Red Sox think is good enough and loose enough to keep it
going.</TE>

<HD>Lieber Makes Quick Work of Cardinals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Jon Lieber didn't have to worry about much offense but got what he
needed from Fred McGriff.</LD>
<LD>   McGriff homered twice, and Lieber pitched a three-hitter as the
Chicago Cubs defeated the St. Louis Cardinals, 2-1, Friday in the
major leagues' fastest game of the season so far.</LD>
<LD>   Lieber (6-4) struck out seven in his 21st career complete game and
third this season.</LD>
<TE>   "I want to finish every time I am out there," Lieber said. "It is
just my mentality."</TE>
<TE>   The game took only 1 hour 49 minutes to play.</TE>
<TE>   There were no walks and only six hits, three of which were home
runs.</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago right-hander made only one mistake, a home run to J.D.
Drew, the second batter of the game. Drew hit Lieber's first pitch to
him for his 11th homer of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Lieber retired the next 10 Cardinals. Between the fifth and the
eighth innings, he retired 15 of 16 and didn't allow any runners to
reach second base.</TE>
<TE>   Woody Williams (4-3) retired the first 12 Cubs until McGriff tied
it in the fifth inning with a homer into the right-field bleachers.
It was the first home run Williams had allowed in 22 innings.</TE>
<TE>   In the seventh, McGriff hit his second of the game and 13th this
season. It was the third time this season McGriff homered twice in a
game, the 39th multiple home-run game of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Williams gave up only three hits and struck out seven in seven
innings.</TE>

<HD>Hunter Passes on Free Agency and Will Stay With Lakers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lindsey Hunter notified the Lakers on Friday afternoon that he would
return to the team next season, a decision that could cost the club
as much as $8.1 million in the next two years.</LD>
<LD>   Samaki Walker reached the same conclusion last week, though for
considerably less, at $1.54 million, and so it appears most of the
players in Phil Jackson's regular rotation will return.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers' remaining free agents are Devean George, Brian Shaw,
Mitch Richmond, Slava Medvedenko and Jelani McCoy. According to NBA
regulations, the Lakers can negotiate with free agents beginning July
1 and can sign them on July 17.</LD>
<TE>   Hunter, who could have opted out of his contract, came to the
Lakers from Milwaukee last June in a trade for Greg Foster, a deal
that insured them against further injury to or a slow recovery by
Derek Fisher, who required foot surgery for the second consecutive
summer.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter played 82 regular-season games and started 47 of them, most
early in the season during Fisher's rehabilitation.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter made 38% of his three-point shots and averaged 5.8 points.
In the playoffs, he spent a majority of his playing time defending
Tony Parker and Mike Bibby, in particular, and averaged only 7.3
minutes.</TE>

<DL>ULSAN, South Korea</DL>
<LD>The chance was there, theirs for the taking. And this is what
America's band of soccer-playing brothers did with it:</LD>
<LD>   Appeared on Letterman and Leno.</LD>
<LD>   Made the cover of Sports Illustrated. Twice.</LD>
<TE>   Got "Good Morning America" interested enough to check in for
mid-game updates.</TE>
<TE>   Changed a nation's sleeping habits for three crazed and
caffeine-addled weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Broke through to the front page of some of the country's major
daily newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   Received a phone call from the president.</TE>
<TE>   Redeemed themselves, and their captain, Claudio Reyna, for the
disgrace of their last-place showing at the 1998 World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Proved to the world that men in the United States also play
soccer.</TE>
<TE>   Ran the Germans so ragged for 90 minutes Friday in Ulsan that
several of them, including the formidable goalkeeper Oliver (King)
Kahn, collapsed from exhaustion, clutching the ground for comfort as
their lungs heaved to take in more oxygen.</TE>
<TE>   Was it enough?</TE>
<TE>   Will this remarkable run through the 2002 World Cup be remembered
for all the gains and inroads soccer made into the U.S. mainstream
consciousness after decades of not-quite-passive resistance?</TE>
<TE>   Or will it be remembered more for what Team USA didn't do with the
chance it finally earned after 72 years of thankless laboring:</TE>
<TE>   Make the World Cup semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   As incredible as it is to read it, hear it and even type it, the
United States men's soccer team should have advanced to the World
Cup's Final Four on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   But didn't.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans outworked the heavily favored Germans so thoroughly
that Kahn finished the night on his knees, seeming to give prayerful
thanks for the final whistle, which finally meant a cease-fire from
everything Landon Donovan, Eddie Lewis, Gregg Berhalter and Tony
Sanneh threw at him, which was an awful lot.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike their World Cup meeting in 1998, when the Americans cowed
at the very sight of the glowering Germans and ran for cover before
being run out of the building, 2-0, this time, Team USA gave as well
as it received, and then some. When Germany tried to knock the
Americans around in Ulsan, fouling them 14 times, the U.S. retaliated
with 23 fouls.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike what happened in Paris four years ago, the only thing
yellow about the Americans' performance in the rematch was the color
of the cards they accumulated--five total, mostly in self-defense.</TE>
<TE>   The United States also outshot Germany, 11-6, put more shots on
net, 6-2, and controlled the ball for nearly 60% of the match.</TE>
<TE>   And lost, 1-0.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we were the better team," said Berhalter, whose lunging
volley in the 50th minute struck the arm of German defender Torsten
Frings while Frings was standing on the goal line, yet no penalty was
called, apparently because he made no play on it with his arm or
hand. "I think we played good enough to win."</TE>
<TE>   Germany's Kahn and Marco Bode conceded Berhalter's point.</TE>
<TE>   "We were lucky to win," Bode said.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans got the Germans' respect and stamp of approval,
which is nice. But the Germans are the ones going on to the semifinal
against either Spain or South Korea, which, ultimately, is the thing
that matters.</TE>
<TE>   It could have been the Americans. It should have been the
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   And it is an opportunity, months and years from now, the Americans
will want back, because real shots at the World Cup semifinals don't
materialize every day. Spain, home to one of the most intense soccer
cultures on the planet, has never played in a World Cup semifinal.
Neither has Ireland or Mexico. England, which invented the sport, has
been to the World Cup semifinals only twice.</TE>
<TE>   Given its chance, the United States did a good amount with it,
scaring Germany from start to finish, but could have done so much
more.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Coach Bruce Arena, who had squeezed so much out of this
much-maligned squad through four games, picked an odd time to keep
several key weapons in storage.</TE>
<TE>   Forward Clint Mathis, according to Arena, is "our best goal scorer
when he has a look at the goal," yet Arena didn't start Mathis and
didn't bring him on until the final half-hour. Instead, Arena opened
the game with Brian McBride, whose chief asset--heading the ball--was
neutralized by the taller Germans and failed to do much with the ball
at his feet during his 57 minutes. Midfielder DaMarcus Beasley would
have been the fastest man of the field, which might have caused
Germany, which had a handful with Donovan, severe problems. But
Beasley did not play a minute, which prompted reporters after the
game to ask if Beasley were injured.</TE>
<TE>   No, Arena replied, "DaMarcus could have played tonight. We thought
about bringing him in. But Eddie Lewis was having a good game on the
left side."</TE>
<TE>   Mathis did not have a shot in his 33 minutes. Instead, second-half
scoring chances fell to right back Sanneh, who knocked two headers
wide--one by only inches in the 89th minute--and left back Berhalter
and defensive midfielder John O'Brien, whose attempt from the top of
the box was hit straight at Kahn.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed," said Sanneh. "I don't want to blame ourselves,
but we missed chances to score."</TE>
<TE>   Reyna walked off the field wrapped in the American flag, fitting
after representing it so well Friday. His gritty all-purpose
performance earned him game most-valuable-player honors--along with a
respectful handshake and hug from his tormenter of 1998, Jens
Jeremies.</TE>
<TE>   So the Americans walked away proud, and out of the tournament, and
the Germans hobbled off relieved, and into the Final Four. A moral
victory still beats international humiliation any day of the World
Cup, but the U.S. leaves Asia with a nagging sense of not getting a
full return for its effort.</TE>
<TE>   Years from now, we might have the answer, but for now we can only
ask: Was the 2002 quarterfinal against Germany the one we'd been
waiting for?</TE>
<TE>   Or the one that got away?</TE>

<LD>As Thursday night bleeds into Friday morning, as Brazil and England
fight through the most anticipated match of the monthlong World Cup
tournament, Zabumba, a small, colorful dining and dancing place in
Culver City, played host to fans wearing the colors of Brazil's flag.</LD>
<LD>   Four miles away, in a drizzle fit for London, a hundred or more
mostly men pack a place called the Cock N Bull Pub. They drink
Guinness by the gallon and cuss colorfully at their beloved English
players and the confoundedly creative Brazilian opponents.</LD>
<LD>   The plan is to watch a half of Friday's World Cup quarterfinal at
a place where Brazilians have gathered and then to watch the second
half at a place where Englishmen have gathered.</LD>
<TE>   Zabumba, a small, yellow building with a gated courtyard outside
and a small, cozy dining room/dance floor/bar inside, is owned by
Monica Burgos. Burgos is an enthusiastic woman from Rio de Janeiro
who came here 12 years ago and opened her small club on Venice
Boulevard in Culver City eight years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Zabumba exudes an energy that is different from our normal
sporting events. Laker fans do not gather four hours before a game to
dance a sensual rumba or a sweaty meringue. Five hours before the
game, Nikki Collins, Sania Seedat and a group of friends have
commandeered a table near one of the four televisions that are set up
around the room.</TE>
<TE>   Collins and Seedat are West Los Angeles residents and have no
particular ties to Brazil. But they have fallen under the spell,
Seedat says, of the beauty, spirit and creativity of Brazilian
soccer. "It is soccer from the heart," Seedat says. "Sport from the
heart."</TE>
<TE>   An hour and a half before the game, more fans are standing outside
Zabumba than inside. They are pressed against the front door, hoping
to be the first in if someone leaves.</TE>
<TE>   Brian and Danielle Schween have driven from Tustin. Danielle is
Brazilian. She came here four years ago to go to school and now she
is married to Brian. California is home but Brazilian soccer is her
lifeblood. As a band plays a rowdy rhythm and the room grows hotter
by the second, Danielle pulls Brian from his chair to dance. "I get
my energy from the music," Danielle says.</TE>
<TE>   As the televisions, tuned to the Spanish broadcast, fill with
Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho, the Brazilian heroes, the band stops
and silence takes over. It is serious now. And when Michael Owen
scores the first goal in the 25th minute for England, the happy
colors of Brazil seem out of place.</TE>
<TE>   A few moments later, two members of the L.A. Fire Department enter
the room. Anyone not sitting must leave and the people standing
outside must go away. Police stand watch. Everyone obeys. If it's be
tossed or sit, sitting happens and so it is as if a giant pogo stick
is unleashed when Rivaldo scores the tying goal during the extra time
before the first half ends.</TE>
<TE>   At the Cock N Bull, there had been a collective groan, Tony says,
when Rivaldo scored that goal. Tony wears an Owen jersey and says his
last name doesn't matter. "I'm just a subject of the English football
team," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Tony's mood blackens further when, five minutes into the second
half, Brazil goes ahead on a free kick from Ronaldinho.</TE>
<TE>   Nervous men in tight England T-shirts pace outside the pub,
smoking cigarettes in silence.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the windows are steamed, the air heavy with the sweat of
fear and disappointment. The TVs were tuned to ESPN and the
English-language broadcast here. As the English failed to capitalize
after Ronaldinho was sent off and the Brazilians had to play 10
against England's 11, the cursing became louder. The final seconds
ticked away on Brazil's 2-1 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Back in Culver City, with the police and firemen gone, the Zabumba
hopefuls who had been shooed away returned from hiding. They waved
Brazilian flags and honked car horns. An angry neighbor stuck her
head out a window and yelled, "Shut up!" Someone shouted back, "Let
us be happy."</TE>
<TE>   There was one thing, though, that was the same at Zabumba and the
Cock N Bull. Whenever the TV announcers, be it the Spanish or English
broadcasts, promoted the Germany-U.S. match, a chant went up,
"U.S.A., U.S.A."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. team has become a common denominator in our multicultural
landscape. Spanish-language broadcasters and fans have taken to
calling the U.S. "el equipo de todos nosotros." The team of all of
us. That's a triumph almost as good as winning the World Cup. Almost.</TE>

<HD>America Turns Out for Sunrise Service</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Fans get up early for gatherings across the nation
to watch World Cup quarterfinals between U.S. and Germany.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sun had yet to rise when Ursula Souders and her two children got
up, pulled on their German soccer jerseys and headed for a German
restaurant not far from their home. What better place to watch their
beloved German team face the United States in a World Cup
quarterfinal match on Friday?</LD>
<LD>   Except the Loreley Restaurant in Anaheim was already crowded when
they arrived at 4:20 a.m. Crowded with people rooting for the other
side.</LD>
<LD>   "We didn't realize how many Americans would be here," said
Souders, a native of Wertheim, who chose seats in the back, near
trophies and plaques won by a local German club soccer team.</LD>
<TE>   Across the nation, Americans awoke at an uncommonly early hour to
watch an uncommon spectacle. The U.S. team had reached the
quarterfinal round for the first time since 1930 and, quite suddenly,
soccer was important to a society that had previously dismissed it as
an exercise for children and moms driving mini-vans.</TE>
<TE>   They lined up in the pre-dawn darkness outside the ESPN Zone, a
massive sports bar in Times Square in New York. About 4,000 of them
watched on a giant screen at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium in Washington;
5,000 went to a stadium in Columbus, Ohio. Six hundred shuffled into
the Arena Club at Staples Center, where they were joined by members
of the Galaxy.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not surprised by those amounts of people," said Alexi Lalas,
who played for the U.S. at the 1994 and 1998 World Cups and went to
Staples dressed--appropriately enough--in a bathrobe.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a soccer underground in this country that escapes every
four years," he said. "When that happens, we have a party and let the
outsiders in too."</TE>
<TE>   The various soccer gatherings were as different in ambience and
volume as the venues that hosted them.</TE>
<TE>   In Times Square, where the game began at a more manageable 7:30
a.m., the ESPN sports bar was filled with American flags and cheers
of "USA! USA!" from a partisan crowd. Ally Christianson, who played
women's soccer in college, was talking by cell phone to her roommate.
He was from Germany and had gone to a nearby German bar that was so
crowded, he had to watch from outside through the window.</TE>
<TE>   Joel Liestman, an actor who works in a law firm, made a night of
it, watching an earlier quarterfinal match before going to Times
Square.</TE>
<TE>   "I got up at 7 a.m. yesterday, went to work," he said. "We went to
a bar for England versus Brazil and then walked all the way up here."</TE>
<TE>   The goings-on were more stately in Washington, where, not far from
RFK Stadium, the German embassy invited a select group of government
officials, politicos and friends to join them at the consulate office
in the posh Embassy Row district.</TE>
<TE>   Bavarian rolls and danishes were served as the game was televised
on a 20-foot screen. Christoph Eichhorn, an embassy attache, wore
black-, red- and yellow-striped suspenders to show his support for
his country's team but, like others, tried to be sensitive to the
feelings of Americans in attendance.</TE>
<TE>   One German booster made a quick remark when a U.S. player received
a second yellow card, which would have made him ineligible for the
next match. "There won't be a next match," the fan said. Otherwise,
Eichhorn tried his best to smooth hard feelings after Germany's 1-0
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing you learn with soccer is patience," he said. "You'll
have a great American team in the future, which is something to look
forward to."</TE>
<TE>   Fans on the West Coast--three time zones away--were required to
make a greater sacrifice to get out and watch the game. Connor
Bohuslavizki, 9, got up at 3 a.m. so his father could paint his face
red, white and blue before they went to the Loreley Restaurant and
grabbed seats directly in front of the television screen.</TE>
<TE>   At Staples, some attendees sported tousled hair and morning
whiskers. They attempted to wash away the stupor from a short night's
sleep with juice and coffee, though some were not entirely successful
judging by the conversation between two fans unhappy about the
officiating of referee Hugh Dallas of Scotland, who gave five yellow
cards to U.S. players.</TE>
<TE>   Fan No. 1: "Where's this ref from?"</TE>
<TE>   Fan No. 2: "Dallas."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the mood was surprisingly upbeat and lively for the time of
day. Fans cheered loudly. Many of them--such as Jaco Van Broekhuizen
and his friends from Corona and Norco--adorned themselves in
everything from face paint to dyed hair and patriotic clothing.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody thought this could happen," Van Broekhuizen said. "We're
here to watch the upset of the century."</TE>
<TE>   His prediction did not come to pass, much to the relief of
Souders, a schoolteacher who had promised to bake cookies for her
students if the U.S. won.</TE>
<TE>   American fans expressed disappointment, but the scene at Staples
was festive enough that Lalas was prompted to call the match a
success, the final result notwithstanding.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important thing about this team is that it made an
impact on U.S. society and culture," he said. "The rest is gravy."</TE>

<HD>Leslie Back in Stride in Sparks' Win</HD>
<DH>WNBA: A 73-64 victory is L.A.'s 11th in a row over
Minnesota. Leslie has 23 points in return after one-game absence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Few teams trouble the Sparks as much as the Minnesota Lynx do.</LD>
<LD>   And few teams keep losing to the Sparks the way the Lynx do.</LD>
<LD>   Both teams followed the script, right down to the final dissolve
Friday. The Lynx made the Sparks work for everything they got,
including the 73-64 victory before 9,112 at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   The victory wasn't secure until the Sparks (9-1), clinging to a
60-59 lead with 3:15 to play, held the Lynx (4-6) to two field goals
the rest of the way.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's victory was the sixth in a row for the Sparks this
season. Since losing to Minnesota in their first meeting June 24,
1999, the Sparks have won 11 consecutive from the Lynx. It also was
the Sparks' 26th consecutive home win.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Leslie, back after missing one game because of illness, paced
the Sparks with 23 points and nine rebounds. Leslie was at her best
at the free-throw line, making eight of nine attempts. Minnesota
guard Katie Smith led all scorers with 27.</TE>
<TE>   Spark Coach Michael Cooper is glad his team has only one more
meeting with Minnesota--at least in the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate to play that team," Cooper said. "[Minnesota Coach] Brian
[Agler] is a very good defensive coach, and his teams make it
difficult because they always play in-your-face defense and won't let
you move freely around the court."</TE>
<TE>   But the Sparks, who trailed at halftime, 31-29, and could never
put a comfortable cushion between them and the Lynx, knew they shared
some blame for the game being tight.</TE>
<TE>   "We came out sluggish at the start," said Latasha Byears, who
supplied 12 points and seven rebounds off the bench. "And they are a
physical, aggressive team. They don't have all the athletes we do, so
they wanted to make the game ugly. We've got to start games more
aggressively."</TE>
<TE>   DeLisha Milton, who returned to the starting lineup Friday and
also had 12 points, said the Sparks were lagging defensively even
though Minnesota shot only 40.4% for the game.</TE>
<TE>   "We came into the locker room at halftime, looked at a couple of
clips, and saw we were just standing around with our arms in the
air," Milton said. "In the second half we were determined to at least
move our feet."</TE>
<TE>   But the Sparks, who shot 38.1% and barely edged the Lynx on the
boards, 31-30, weren't moved to put Minnesota away until the game's
final minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I said this last year and I'll say it again--sometimes I don't
think we know how good we are," Cooper said. "Last year we learned
how to win a championship. This year we're learning how to repeat. We
still don't know that, yet. But a win is a win."</TE>
<TE>   Agler would gladly take any win he could get against the Sparks.
And he was frustrated his team did not take one here Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "The Sparks are a very good team that knows what level it has to
rise to when it needs to," Agler said. "We're not there yet. We still
have to learn to take advantage of the opportunity we had tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll get a win against them eventually. I just don't know when."</TE>
<TE>   Before the game Cooper said he planned to give L.A.'s latest
addition, veteran center Marlies Askamp, some generous playing time
even though Askamp did not join the team from Miami until Thursday.
He wanted to keep from overworking Leslie, who missed Tuesday's game
in Seattle with flu-like symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   Askamp wound up playing six minutes and did not score. Because
Minnesota kept the game close, Leslie wound up playing 28 minutes,
which is still 10 minutes under her average.</TE>

<HD>Benko Is Still Going Strong</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The end of the road is still out of sight for Lindsay Benko. In fact,
the 2000 Olympic gold medalist believes her swimming career is just
picking up speed.</LD>
<LD>   Benko won the 100-meter freestyle and finished second in the 400
freestyle Friday, highlighting the second day of competition in the
TYR Swim Meet of Champions at the Marguerite Recreation Center in
Mission Viejo.</LD>
<LD>   Benko, 25, was the oldest swimmer to reach any of the championship
finals in the four women's events Friday. She looked strongest in the
100 freestyle, trailing 2000 Olympian Gabrielle Rose by half a second
at the halfway point before inching ahead to win in 57.02 seconds.
Rose, who swims for the Irvine Novaquatics, was second in 57.09.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know why I'm swimming as fast as ever," said Benko, a
graduate of USC who still competes for the Trojan swim club.</TE>
<TE>   Benko said she has renewed enthusiasm for her career, which took a
scary turn last July when she broke her kneecap while jumping into
the pool the first day she arrived in Japan for the world
championships. She bounced back to win the 200 freestyle at the
national championships a month later, then set a world record in the
event in April in the World Short-Course Swimming Championships in
Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   "Hurting myself made me realize how much I love to swim," said
Benko, who won a gold medal at the Sydney Games as part of the 800
freestyle relay.</TE>
<TE>   Benko plans to swim the 200 freestyle today, when the meet
continues with the men's and women's 200 breaststroke, 50 freestyle
and 400 individual medley.</TE>
<TE>   Benko's teammate, Joanna Fargus, won the 200 backstroke in
2:15.00. Emily Mason of Arizona Desert Fox won the 200 butterfly
(2:13.03) and 400 freestyle (4:15.32). Chad Carvin of the Mission
Viejo Nadadores won the men's 400 freestyle in 3:57.08.</TE>

<HD>Sprinter Greene Is Fastest for a Day</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PALO ALTO</DL>
<LD>With a dramatic dash and a withering stare, Maurice Greene
temporarily silenced the man who had questioned his claim as the
world's fastest human.</LD>
<LD>   Greene won his semifinal heat of the men's 100 meters at the U.S.
Track and Field Championships on Friday night in 9.99 seconds. As he
crossed the finish line, Greene looked over his left shoulder at Tim
Montgomery, who was second in 10.13.</LD>
<LD>   "Like I said, there's been a lot of talk. Now it's time to show
what you've got," Greene said.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the talk has come from Montgomery, who has the fastest
time in the world this year and has spent months questioning Greene's
speed. On Friday night, Montgomery paid homage to his rival.</TE>
<TE>   "That was great, I would have done it to him," Montgomery said of
the stare</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the two will face off again tonight in the final.</TE>
<TE>   In the women's 100, Marion Jones won her semifinal heat into a 5
mph headwind in 10.98 seconds--a quarter-second quicker than anyone
else in her heat.</TE>
<TE>   Chryste Gaines won the other women's semifinal in 10.96, but she
was running with a light tailwind.</TE>
<TE>   The first day of the three-day national championships offered
chilly conditions and strong winds.</TE>
<TE>   The temperature at the start of the meet was 63 degrees, but gusty
winds of 17 mph made it feel significantly colder.</TE>
<TE>   Serene Ross broke her U.S. record while winning the women's
javelin with a throw of 197 feet. She had a throw of 195-8 in May.</TE>
<TE>   Lance Deal, 40, who retired after the 2000 Sydney Olympics,
returned to win his ninth national title in the hammer throw with a
toss of 244-5.</TE>
<TE>   Savante Stringfellow won the men's long jump with a leap of 27
feet 11 inches, the best in the world this year; Brianna Glenn won
the women's long jump; Tisha Waller won her fourth national title in
the women's high jump, and Teri Steer won the women's shotput.</TE>

<TE>*--*
Top-five prospects for the NHL draft beginning today (10 a.m., EPSN2)
and Sunday. (Age in parenthesis):
JAY BOUWMEESTER (19)-- DEFENSE
* He is considered the top prospect in the draft and should be able
to make the jump from juniors directly to the NHL. He is a strong
skater, with exceptional acceleration. At 6 feet 4, he should fill
out from the 206 pounds he now weighs to be able to handle the
physical style of the league, as well as dish it out. The downside is
scouts worry that his development has leveled off since being a
16-year-old on Canada's world junior team
RICK NASH (18)-- LEFT WING
* There is no doubt that he has scoring abilities, as a 61-goal
season during his first Bantam Hockey season in 1999-2000 showed.
There are scouts who feel he has more potential than Bouwmeester
after an impressive showing at an under-18 tournament last summer.
Projected as a power forward, but there are concerns about his speed.
Still, he scored 63 goals the last two seasons with London of the
Ontario Hockey League
JONI PITKANEN (19) -- DEFENSE
* This is not your typical don't-hit-me European. He likes physical
play and excels in that style. Scouts have compared his skating
abilities to Detroit's Niklas Lidstrom. An impressive showing for
Team Finland at the world junior championships last winter did
nothing to damage that image. He had one goal and four points in
seven games during the tournament. He has played the last two seasons
with Karpat in the Finnish league
KARI LEHTONEN (19)-- GOALIE
* Rated as the top goalie in the draft and some feel he may be picked
right after Bouwmeester. As a rookie in the Finnish league last
season, he led Jokerit to the title. He had a 1.78 goals-against
average and a .940 save percentage in 11 playoff games. He stopped 55
of 56 shots in the final two playoff games and was named the MVP. At
6 feet 3, he has the size to fill up the net
RYAN WHITNEY (19)-- DEFENSE
* He rates a shade below Bouwmeester, Nash, Pitkanen and Lehtonen in
this thin draft. But scouts like his 6-foot-3, 200-pound frame. He
has a good shot and is very agile. Although not blessed with
exceptional skills, he has ice smarts, which he demonstrated as a
freshman at Boston University last season. He had four goals and 19
points in 31 games. He was a member of the U.S. under-18 team in
2000-01</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Laimbeer knew he had a lot of work ahead when he accepted his
first WNBA coaching job.</LD>
<LD>   Friday, he found out how much.</LD>
<LD>   Detroit extended its WNBA-record worst start to 0-11 with an 80-59
loss to the Orlando Miracle before a crowd of 5,862 at Auburn Hills,
Mich. It tied the league mark for longest losing streak in league
history.</LD>
<TE>   "Well, I knew this wasn't going to be easy," Laimbeer said. "I've
only had one practice with the team, so tonight was a chance for me
to watch and learn. ... The biggest thing I learned tonight is that
our offense needs a total overhaul."</TE>
<TE>   Nykesha Sales led Orlando (6-3) with 24 points. Detroit rookie
Swin Cash scored 20 points.</TE>
<TE>   "I think today is still a positive," Detroit's Dominique Canty
said. "Bill knows how to win, and he's a very laid-back, fun guy.
He's going to keep us up, and that's what we need right now."</TE>
<TE>   Houston 61, Phoenix 59--Sheryl Swoopes made a three-point shot at
the buzzer to give the Comets (8-3) the victory before 10,460 at
Houston. Lisa Harrison gave the Mercury (5-3) a 59-58 lead with one
second left in the game, but Swoopes took an inbounds pass from
Coquese Washington and made the winning shot from the corner. The
Comets were down by as many as 17 points before Swoopes scored 22 of
her 27 points over the final 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 65, Miami 60--Chamique Holdsclaw scored 19 points,
including two free throws with 19 seconds remaining, as the Mystics
(8-2) held off the Sol (2-7) before 10,412 at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 80, New York 69--Chasity Melvin scored a career-high 30
points and Jennifer Rizzotti doubled her previous best with 14
assists to lead the Rockers (3-5) before 9,601 at Cleveland. Vickie
Johnson scored 19 points for New York (7-5).</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 63, Indiana 51--Kamila Vodichkova scored 20 points and Sue
Bird added 16 as the Storm (5-6) snapped a three-game losing streak
with the victory over the Fever (5-6) before 5,232 at Seattle.</TE>

<KH>WORLD CUP QUARTERFINALS * GERMANY 1, U.S. 0</KH>
<HD>Not All Is Lost for U.S.</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Tested throughout, Germany and goalkeeper Kahn work
hard to make Ballack's goal in 39th minute stand up as Americans walk
away with a measure of satisfaction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ULSAN, South Korea</DL>
<LD>One goal was all that separated the United States from soccer history
here Friday night. One goal, nothing more.</LD>
<LD>   All it took was a first-half header by Michael Ballack off a free
kick by Christian Ziege--a play that took all of 10 seconds to
complete--to give Germany a 1-0 victory over the U.S. and a place in
the semifinals of the 2002 World Cup.</LD>
<LD>   For the other 89 minutes and 50 seconds, the Americans played the
Germans on even terms. The U.S. was perhaps even a shade better. And
it came within inches of tying the score.</LD>
<TE>   At the end, when referee Hugh Dallas of Scotland blew the final
whistle to signal the close of a remarkable World Cup run by the
U.S., it was the German players who collapsed to the turf in relief.
They knew that they had been tested to the fullest.</TE>
<TE>   "We're disappointed because we thought we could have won," said
U.S. goalkeeper Brad Friedel. "But that's why they're so good. They
can play games like this and win when maybe they're not the best
team.</TE>
<TE>   "The satisfying thing is knowing that we could have gone a little
further. It's frustrating, but it's satisfying as well. We can go
home with our heads held high."</TE>
<TE>   Germany, winner of the World Cup in 1954, 1974 and 1990, is the
first to admit that its 2002 team is not as strong as past German
sides. Nevertheless, it will be playing the winner of today's
quarterfinal between Spain and South Korea in the semifinals on
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   That's if the players can recover in time. By the end of Friday
night's match in front of 37,337 at the Munsu Football Stadium, they
looked utterly spent.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans ran at them all night but were unable to find a way
to beat goalkeeper Oliver Kahn, who came up with some key saves but
also enjoyed a measure of good fortune.</TE>
<TE>   Kahn was the difference in the game, the U.S. players and coaches
agreed, and at the end he was one of several who was stretched out on
the grass.</TE>
<TE>   "I was absolutely exhausted," he said. "You shouldn't
underestimate how stressful a match can be for goalkeepers, because
we cannot run, we just stand there. The mental stress on a goalkeeper
is immense."</TE>
<TE>   As he has done throughout the tournament, U.S. Coach Bruce Arena
threw a few wrinkles into his starting lineup, leaving expected
starters DaMarcus Beasley and Clint Mathis on the bench and bringing
Frankie Hejduk back into the lineup after he had missed the
second-round victory over Mexico because of suspension.</TE>
<TE>   Arena even moved players around. Instead of being at left back,
for example, Hejduk was in right midfield. Claudio Reyna, who had
played right midfield against Mexico, was shifted to the center.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm proud of my boys," Arena said. "We demonstrated to the world
that the U.S. deserved to be here. We've made a lot of progress since
1998."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. lost all three games at the France '98 World Cup and was
ousted in the first round, but this time it finished with a 2-2-1
record and advanced further in the tournament than at any time since
1930.</TE>
<TE>   "Overall, the Germans had two chances in the match and converted
one of them," Arena said. "That's the difference today."</TE>
<TE>   The first half was an intriguing affair, played at a good pace and
with both teams creating scoring chances.</TE>
<TE>   "We came out there and got after the German team, which was our
game plan," Arena said.</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Lewis, a dynamo all night, forced Kahn to look lively in
punching away a dangerous cross early on; Tony Sanneh caused panic in
the German defense with an overlapping run, and Landon Donovan
narrowly missed putting the U.S. ahead when he beat midfielder
Dietmar Hamann and then cut inside defender Thomas Linke before
firing a low, angled shot that Kahn appeared to barely touch as it
flashed just outside the left post.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S., which outshot Germany, 11-6, should have scored in the
36th minute when Brian McBride made a run down the left before
crossing the ball to Donovan, who played it back into the path of
Lewis. The former UCLA player's shot brought a fine reaction save
from Kahn.</TE>
<TE>   Friedel had no such luck two minutes later, however, when Germany
grabbed the lead. Lewis, was called for a foul and Ziege floated the
ball across the U.S. goalmouth. Ballack leaped and shouldered his way
between defenders Sanneh and Gregg Berhalter and headed the ball
powerfully downward from about six yards.</TE>
<TE>   Friedel dived to his right, but a fraction of a second late, and
the ball slipped beneath his arm and into the net, to the huge relief
of the German bench.</TE>
<TE>   In the second half, the Americans became increasingly physical,
and Reyna, Pablo Mastroeni and Berhalter all were cautioned by
Dallas. Germany made some forays, but as the half ticked away, its
players were content to protect their slender lead.</TE>
<TE>   The closest the U.S. came to putting the ball in the net was five
minutes into the second half when Germany had a lucky escape.</TE>
<TE>   Berhalter lunged at a corner kick and Kahn had to get down low to
his right to block the shot. The ball almost went over the line,
rebounded back up and hit Germany's Torsten Frings, who was standing
at the left post, on the arm before being cleared.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. players appealed for a hand-ball call, but there was no
foul involved because Frings had his arm down at his side and made no
move to play the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Arena sent Mathis on in place of McBride, Cobi Jones on in place
of Lewis and, finally, Earnie Stewart on in place of Mastroeni, but
the Germans withstood the pressure.</TE>
<TE>   The final U.S. chance came in the 89th minute when Jones crossed
the ball and Sanneh's header slammed into the side netting, bringing
a gasp from the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   It was a last gasp, however, and the final whistle brought both
the game and the Americans' 2002 World Cup saga to a close.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been incredible," Friedel said. "We've had a great ride."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Consulting the Rule Book</TE>
<TE>   In the 49th minute of Friday's Germany-United States World Cup
quarterfinal, a shot by American Gregg Berhalter bounced off German
goalkeeper Oliver Kahn and hit the left arm of German defender
Torsten Frings, who was standing on the goal line.</TE>
<TE>   Scottish referee Hugh Dallas did not call a hand-ball on Frings.
While Dallas might not have seen Frings touch the ball, even if the
referee had, he would not be obligated to issue the United States a
penalty kick.</TE>
<TE>   According to Law 12 of the International Football Assn. Board's
Laws of the Game, the rule book for soccer:</TE>
<TE>   "A direct free kick is awarded to the opposing team if a player
... handles the ball deliberately (except for the goalkeeper within
his own penalty area). ... A penalty kick is awarded if the above
offense is committed by a player inside his own penalty area,
irrespective of the position of the ball, provided it is in play."</TE>
<TE>   However, if in the referee's opinion the ball hit Frings' arm
inadvertently, then he need not make a call, as a later note
explains:</TE>
<TE>   "If the ball strikes the defender accidentally, no offense is
committed."</TE>

<LD>Car bomb explosions bearing the hallmarks of the Basque separatist
group ETA rocked two Mediterranean resorts and a major northeastern
city Friday as European Union leaders met under tight security in
Seville.</LD>
<LD>   A British tourist was critically wounded and five other people
were hurt by flying glass when the first explosion shook the Spanish
resort of Fuengirola, 90 miles southeast of Seville.</LD>
<LD>   Six hours later, a bomb detonated in the center of Marbella. It
caused no injuries.</LD>
<TE>   A blast Friday night rocked Zaragoza, 530 miles northeast of
Seville, the Interior Ministry said. Police said a security guard was
slightly injured in the explosion in a department store parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   As in recent ETA bombings, callers claiming to speak on behalf of
the outlawed group gave detailed warnings before each blast. Police
said they received warnings that ETA, which stands for Basque
Homeland and Freedom, planned to attack tourist targets during the EU
summit.</TE>

<HD>Probe of Consulate Blast in Pakistan Still Stymied</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>One week after a bombing attack on the U.S. Consulate in the port
city of Karachi left 12 people dead and more than 50 wounded, an
array of law enforcement agencies are still searching for their first
breakthrough, Pakistani police said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "We have no conclusive evidence yet that links anyone with the
bombing," said Syed Kamal Shah, chief of police for Sindh province,
which includes Karachi. "We have not arrested anyone, Arabs or
otherwise, in connection with the case."</LD>
<LD>   The involvement of so many U.S. and Pakistani agencies in the
investigation has generated confusion, according to police officials
who declined to be identified. Pakistani paramilitary units, the FBI,
the intelligence services from both countries and the Sindh
provincial police are all involved in the case.</LD>
<TE>   Another government agency, the province's Home Department,
announced Friday that the FBI had completed its investigation of the
site and that the road adjacent to the consulate, where the bomb
exploded, would be reopened to traffic before Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking privately, police said they were still leaning toward a
theory that the bomb was planted in a driver's education car and
detonated by remote control. That would suggest a higher level of
sophistication than a bombing in Karachi last month that killed 14
people, including 11 French technicians, and a suicide attack in
March on a church in the capital, Islamabad, that killed five people,
including two Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Police had expected earlier this week to receive the results of
FBI lab tests that they hoped would confirm which of two vehicles
involved in the explosion at the consulate carried the bomb, but as
of Friday there had been no public comment on the results. Both the
driver's education car and a small commercial van were blown apart.</TE>
<TE>   Senior police officers Friday evaded media questions about the FBI
report.</TE>
<TE>   Against the backdrop of denials about arrests, lower-ranking
police officials said that several foreign nationals--believed to be
Arabs--and at least two members of a Muslim extremist group have been
detained by other agencies in Karachi for questioning, apparently on
suspicion of possible ties to the Al Qaeda terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently acting on an FBI tip, Pakistani paramilitary units
raided buildings in an area of the city near the port and detained at
least three Arabs. According to one official who declined to be
identified, a laptop computer and software were seized during the
raids, which were carried out by Pakistani Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   But it was unclear whether the detainees were taken into custody
because of the bombing or were rounded up as part of a nationwide
search for remnants of Al Qaeda. Hundreds of the group's fighters
sought refuge in Pakistan after fleeing Afghanistan following the
collapse of the Taliban regime.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani federal counter-terrorism experts in Islamabad have
speculated that the consulate bombing could have been carried out by
Pakistani extremist groups with the help of Al Qaeda operatives
hiding in Karachi.</TE>

<LD>A bold experiment designed to reinforce a basic right in Russia's
Constitution--to be a conscientious objector--is in tatters after the
Russian parliament virtually assured passage of a bill that critics
say buries any meaningful alternative to the draft.</LD>
<LD>   Twenty-one young men in Nizhny Novgorod, about 250 miles east of
Moscow, were guinea pigs in the experiment--doing civil service at a
hospital for the last six months instead of military service.</LD>
<LD>   But the military's general staff demanded Thursday that they be
conscripted, as debate raged about the alternative-service bill,
which passed its second reading in the lower house of parliament
Wednesday. The measure must still pass a third reading, which is
usually pro forma, before it can become law.</LD>
<TE>   The bill mandates that those who do not want to serve two years in
the army must spend 3 1/2 years doing an alternative form of civil
service, such as hospital work or noncombat duties in the military.</TE>
<TE>   The 21 volunteers quit Thursday after they were warned that the
time they had served would not count against military service or
alternative service.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the argument over military service lies one of Russia's
most contentious and difficult reform proposals: oft-repeated but
never delivered plans to slim down the army and reduce its dependence
on conscripts.</TE>
<TE>   Under their constitution, Russians are entitled to an alternative
to military service. But for years, conscientious objectors have
faced jail terms.</TE>
<TE>   Three and a half years of alternative service is like a sentence
for a crime, said Viktor Gursky, who organized the Nizhny Novgorod
project. In a phone interview Friday, he described the bill approved
by the State Duma, or lower house, as the "last straw."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the young men involved are religious. Others, like Yevgeny
Nagornov, 26, call themselves pacifists.</TE>
<TE>   "Since I was a teenager, I have always felt panic at the idea that
I would be ground up by the state military juggernaut that turns
everyone into a cogwheel and kills your individuality," Nagornov
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to be somebody, a person with a face, not just an
inanimate cogwheel," he said in a phone interview, explaining why he
took part in the experiment. One of Nagornov's friends was killed
fighting Russia's war against separatist rebels in the republic of
Chechnya several years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Another volunteer, Yuri Khvalyov, 23, said in a phone interview
that the bill was designed to scare people away from doing an
alternative to military service.</TE>
<TE>   "What our government is offering us is not alternative military
service. It is punishment pure and simple. They are trying to punish
us for being different," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He described the Duma bill as "ridiculous and discriminatory."</TE>
<TE>   One of the main advocates of alternative service is liberal
politician Boris Y. Nemtsov, leader of the Union of Right Forces and
a former governor of Nizhny Novgorod. He argued that the bill would
impede changes in the military.</TE>
<TE>   "The bill, which was passed under direct pressure from the general
staff, runs counter to Russia's interests and those of civil society.
It is reactionary, and it hampers military reform," he said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning, the young men taking part in the experiment
have been under pressure.</TE>
<TE>   In February, a federal court ruled the project illegal, and
prosecutors warned that the time the men had spent washing out
bedpans and cleaning wards would not be counted against their
military service. Some of them gave up and submitted to the draft.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought that there could be some use from this alternative
service of ours," Nagornov said. "We thought that other people would
notice our experiment and follow suit."</TE>
<TE>   Conscientious objection aside, there are many reasons why two
years in the army is unattractive, not least of which is the conflict
in Chechnya, which continues to claim the lives of service members.</TE>
<TE>   Hazing is brutal. Conscripts are beaten and sometimes killed by
fellow soldiers. The rate of suicide among conscripts is high, but
activists like the Soldiers' Mothers Committee claim that many of the
deaths counted as suicides are the result of hazing.</TE>
<TE>   Conditions in the army are poor and food rations often inadequate.
Even in Moscow, conscripts sometimes approach passersby to beg for
money or cigarettes. Conscripts must work in the fields, growing and
harvesting their food.</TE>
<TE>   Khvalyov, a Seventh-day Adventist, said he abhors the idea of
weapons and killing, even in war.</TE>
<TE>   "The Russian armed forces are notorious for hazing practices that
claim hundreds of innocent lives a year. If draftees who prefer to do
the alternative service get sent to military units, the level of
hazing will skyrocket. Soldiers will terrorize and hunt people like
me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of objecting to military service and facing court, many
young men have dodged the draft or paid hefty bribes to military
enlistment officers or doctors to avoid service.</TE>
<TE>   Sons of wealthy Muscovites rarely serve. Most draftees are
villagers from the provinces whose parents lack the means to buy
their way out.</TE>
<TE>   Nagornov said he felt himself marching to a different tune than
the military.</TE>
<TE>   "When they think of a real man, they think of a macho man with
muscles of steel and a gun in his hands," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But if the entire squad is marching in step and only one soldier
is out of step, maybe he is hearing different music."</TE>

<HD>4 Slain Settlers Are Laid to Rest</HD>
<DH>West Bank: Mourners in Itamar demand revenge against
Palestinians and tougher action by the army.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ITAMAR, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Jewish settlers trudged through the smoldering remains of the Shabo
home Friday, gasping at shrapnel holes in the bedroom walls, then
converged on a hillside for the burial of Rachel Shabo and three of
her children.</LD>
<LD>   The settlers demanded swift revenge for the Shabos, slain the
night before when a Palestinian gunman slipped over this isolated
settlement's fence and burst into their home. A neighbor who headed
the community's emergency-response security detail was killed when he
rushed to save them.</LD>
<LD>   A volunteer gingerly swabbed blood Friday morning from the floor
of one of the Shabo children's rooms and sifted through mattress
stuffing that had spilled into heaps, seeking pieces of human flesh
for burial or removal.</LD>
<TE>   It was the second deadly attack here in three weeks, and the
settlers were both angry and eager to fight the Palestinians who
claim the same rocky hills and valleys of the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   "With God's help, the blood spilled here will be soaked in the
land of Samaria and will nourish the olive trees, and with God's
help, we will have revenge," Natan Chay, the settlement's rabbi,
preached before hundreds who came to bury the Shabos.</TE>
<TE>   On the fringes of the crowd, a group of settlers scuffled with
police and heckled the local army commander. "If you did your job,"
someone shouted at Col. Yossi Adiri as he waded into the mourners,
"you wouldn't be attending a funeral!"</TE>
<TE>   Others wept or prayed as they walked to the cemetery, carrying on
stretchers the shrouded bodies of Rachel Shabo, 40, and her sons
Neria, 16; Zvi, 12; and Avishai, 5.</TE>
<TE>   Later, some of the settlers leaving the funeral reportedly
rampaged through the nearby Palestinian village of Hawara, shot to
death a young Palestinian man, and burned cars and a house.</TE>
<TE>   The Shabos were killed after a Palestinian invaded the family
home, the largest on the block and sitting on the southern edge of
the settlement. Earlier reports had indicated that there was more
than one gunman.</TE>
<TE>   Adiri said the intruder apparently shot two or three of the
children shortly after entering the home. They were on the ground
floor, and their mother, upon hearing the shots, rushed downstairs to
see what was happening. She was shot then, Adiri said.</TE>
<TE>   Paramilitary border police hurried to the site, forced their way
into the home and began a room-to-room search while evacuating the
dead and wounded. A young daughter, injured, emerged from a
second-floor room where it turned out the Palestinian had hidden,
Adiri said. The troops flooded the room with hand grenades. The
Palestinian leaped from a window and was shot to death by soldiers
positioned on the ground below, Adiri said.</TE>
<TE>   The upper stories of the house burst into flames, probably when
gunfire hit a gas canister. The body of the youngest child, Avishai,
was not found until after the shooting had stopped and the fire was
put out, Adiri said.</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledged the possibility that one or more members of the
family could have been killed by Israeli fire, caught in the barrage
of bullets and shrapnel.</TE>
<TE>   Rachel Shabo's husband and two eldest children were not at home at
the time of the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian militants consider settlers to be legitimate targets
because of their presence on land that Palestinians want for a future
sovereign state. Settlements on land seized by Israel in the 1967
Middle East War are considered illegal under international law that
prohibits an occupying power from locating its people in occupied
territory.</TE>
<TE>   Itamar, home to about 90 families, is among the most hard-line of
settlements that dot the swath of the West Bank that runs north of
Jerusalem to Nablus. At the funeral, nearly every adult male was
armed, some with M-16 rifles slung across their backs, others with
pistols tucked into their waistbands.</TE>
<TE>   They complained Friday that the actions taken by the army and
government of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to battle the
Palestinians are insufficient, despite a large-scale military
campaign underway in which troops are occupying numerous Palestinian
towns. The settlers said they would like to be allowed to patrol the
region with their own armed squads.</TE>
<TE>   After the funeral, Adiri was confronted repeatedly by settlers
demanding tougher action.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to launch an attack. You can't be on the defensive all
the time," one woman reprimanded the commander. She held a baby in
her arms while two toddlers tugged at her elbow. "It's a scandal."</TE>
<TE>   "We are in Nablus," Adiri responded, referring to the nearest
large Palestinian city. "Do you know that? Do you know?"</TE>
<TE>   "If you claim you don't have enough men, then you should resign,"
she pressed.</TE>
<TE>   "I care about what's happening here, more than you think," Adiri
said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the recent attacks, settlers said they were determined to
hold their ground and expand it, to prove what they consider to be
their God-given entitlement to the land. They have taken extra
security precautions, they said. Some women are getting gun permits.</TE>
<TE>   Rinat Khabra, who lives across the street from the Shabos,
acknowledged that the fear of danger was taking its toll. Her
children, who had played with the Shabos and who hid in a back
bedroom of the Khabra home throughout Thursday night's shooting, ask
difficult questions and spent Friday speaking to a school
psychologist, Khabra said. Somewhat dazed, Khabra said she too was
experiencing symptoms of trauma.</TE>
<TE>   "When these things happen, you are scared," she said. "But
afterward you become stronger. If we don't get stronger, we
collapse."</TE>

<HD>Another Son of Kim Is Held on Bribery Charges</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>A month after arresting one of the South Korean president's sons,
authorities jailed another son Friday on charges of receiving bribes
from businessmen.</LD>
<LD>   Kim Hong Up, the second of President Kim Dae Jung's three sons, is
caught up in the latest corruption scandal to embarrass the South
Korean leader in his last months in office.</LD>
<LD>   In a statement, prosecutors said the younger Kim received $1.8
million in bribes from companies in exchange for influence-peddling.</LD>
<TE>   The president, who has not been implicated in any scandal, has
apologized repeatedly to the nation. But his political party was
defeated in most of the prominent races in local elections last week.</TE>
<TE>   "For the past months, I have felt deep regrets over failing to
supervise my sons' behavior. I feel embarrassed and guilty for
hurting the hearts of the people," the grim-looking president said
Friday in a nationally televised statement. "I again apologize."</TE>
<TE>   Kim Hong Up once worked as an executive of a research center that
was founded by his father to promote reunification with North Korea.
He did not comment while being led out of the prosecutors' office to
a car bound for jail.</TE>

<HD>Sale of Russian Cropland Imminent</HD>
<DH>Reform: A bill would allow private ownership for the first
time in more than eight decades. Foreigners would be able to lease.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>A compromise on the issue of sales to foreigners smoothed the way
Friday for a sweeping bill that would allow Russian farmland to be
bought and sold for the first time since the Bolsheviks came to power
more than eight decades ago.</LD>
<LD>   Giving its preliminary approval on the second of three required
readings of the bill, which is backed by President Vladimir V. Putin,
the lower house of parliament said foreigners could not buy farmland
but could lease it for up to 49 years at a time.</LD>
<LD>   "Common sense has prevailed,'' Agriculture Minister Alexei V.
Gordeyev said. "In my opinion, both farmers and the state will
benefit from this law.''</LD>
<TE>   Private land sales have been a goal among supporters of economic
reform in Russia almost since the collapse of the Soviet Union more
than a decade ago, but it has taken successive governments this long
to overcome entrenched opposition from Communist Party stalwarts and
agricultural interests linked to the old collective farm system.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers backed the bill to permit land sales 245 to 150.
Earlier, however, they amended the draft to say that foreigners and
foreign-owned organizations could only lease farmland.</TE>
<TE>   In a bow to populist fears of the reemergence of giant land
magnates such as existed in Russia in past centuries, the deputies
also voted to limit to 10% the proportion of farmland a buyer could
acquire in a single rural district.</TE>
<TE>   Final approval of the bill on the third reading is expected to be
a mere formality and could come as early as next week. After passage
by the State Duma, or lower house, the bill then has to be approved
by the Federation Council--the upper house, made up of regional
leaders--and signed by Putin to become law. Both are expected to give
their OK.</TE>
<TE>   Communist and Agrarian Party deputies had long balked at private
ownership of farmland, arguing in part that Russians would in effect
lose control over the motherland if wealthy foreigners were allowed
to buy up former collective farms, most of which are now technically
bankrupt.</TE>
<TE>   "This law has been written and passed first and foremost in the
interests of big capital and the upper bourgeoisie.... The investor
and the oligarch will come in and decide everything,'' said Nikolai
Kharitonov, leader of the Agro-Industrial deputies group.</TE>
<TE>   In the run-up to Friday's vote, economic reformers and advisors to
Putin denied that there were hordes of Europeans, Americans or
Chinese waiting in the wings to purchase and operate farms here.</TE>
<TE>   To the contrary, reformers are more concerned about shady insider
dealings involving Russian businesses with close links to local
authorities and say foreign participation in the farmland market
would help ensure greater openness in transactions.</TE>
<TE>   But Putin, sensitive to the populist sentiment against selling
land to foreigners, had begun to back away from the idea of a free
market in land.</TE>
<TE>   Private ownership of farmland would stand as one of Putin's main
economic reforms, completing a package begun last year when the State
Duma approved the sale of nonagricultural land.</TE>
<TE>   Reformers argue that if farmland was privately held, owners would
have an incentive to invest in it. It also could be used as
collateral for loans to rebuild the agricultural infrastructure.</TE>

<HD>Bush's Mideast Plan Nears Completion but Skirts Key Issues</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>After almost two weeks of intensive debate within the administration,
the details of President Bush's proposal to jump-start the Middle
East peace process is taking final shape, according to administration
officials.</LD>
<LD>   The current draft of Bush's speech, U.S. officials said Friday, is
steering away from any bold or risky initiative on two of the most
pivotal issues: the eventual borders of a permanent Palestinian state
and the timeline to achieve it. If the final version of the speech is
equally vague about those questions, it may anger Palestinians and
key Arab governments that have called on the White House to take a
more resolute stand.</LD>
<LD>   On the final borders of a permanent state, the draft does not call
for the return of all territory occupied by Israel during the 1967
Middle East War. Instead, it opts to adopt long-standing language
from United Nations Resolution 242, according to U.S. officials. The
resolution calls for the return of territory conquered by Israel, but
it does not stipulate "all" occupied land or define precisely the
territory it means. That has spawned controversy over the
resolution's interpretation for years.</LD>
<TE>   The current draft of Bush's speech is "very squishy" on final
borders, said a well-placed administration source who requested
anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   On the timeline issue, the draft offers a performance-based
progression toward a permanent state and does not stipulate the two-
or three-year deadline requested by the Arabs and Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "It places the responsibility on the Palestinians to fulfill
certain obligations and responsibilities that will lead to a state,"
said a State Department official who requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Other major issues remain to be sorted out, such as what rights a
new Palestinian state with provisional borders would have and what it
would be entitled to do, according to State Department officials.</TE>
<TE>   Questions that have been under debate all week include whether a
Palestinian state would be able to print money, issue bonds, become a
member of the World Trade Organization or join the United Nations as
a full member with full voting rights.</TE>
<TE>   A state with provisional borders would be charting new territory
in international law, particularly because there would be no
trusteeship by the United Nations or another country.</TE>
<TE>   Another issue still being discussed is Jewish settlements in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. Both the current and past administrations
have called for a freeze on such development but have largely been
ignored.</TE>
<TE>   As the week progressed, Bush's thinking about the details of his
peace plan has been heavily influenced by events in the region, U.S.
officials say. The White House does not want to be seen to be
rewarding the Palestinians at the very time militants have launched a
new round of attacks or asking Israel to make concessions under those
circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   "There is serious opposition to saying anything critical of Israel
in the wake of these terrorism bombings," the State Department
official said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's top foreign policy team met again Friday and is expected to
hold talks this weekend on the final points of the plan.</TE>
<TE>   The speech could come as soon as Monday, the sources said. But it
might be delayed until Bush returns late next week from a meeting in
Canada of the Group of 8 leading industrialized nations.</TE>

<DH>Secession: L.A. officials request a reconsideration of
LAFCO's decision to put Valley issue on the Nov. 5 ballot.</DH>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city of Los Angeles has formally asked the Local Agency Formation
Commission to reconsider its decision to place San Fernando Valley
secession before voters in November.</LD>
<LD>   In support of the request, which was made Thursday and released by
LAFCO on Friday, Mayor James K. Hahn and the Los Angeles City Council
cited their long-standing positions that secession would hurt the
city financially and leave the Valley unable to meet the costs of
independence.</LD>
<LD>   Friday marked the end of the period to seek a reconsideration of
LAFCO's action, taken May 22.</LD>
<TE>   LAFCO and its staff spent more than two years studying the Valley
proposal. The panel voted 8-1 to put it on the Nov. 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Another request for reconsideration was submitted Friday by North
Hills neighborhood activist Harry Coleman. It was not clear whether
it would be accepted, because Coleman did not pay the $4,000 fee
required by LAFCO.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman said he is concerned that secession would divide North
Hills into two City Council districts. He said LAFCO should do more
work on the plan, even if that meant missing the deadline for the
election.</TE>
<TE>   The 30-day period for requesting reconsideration of the Hollywood
secession proposal, which LAFCO has also placed on the ballot, ends
July 5.</TE>

of ownership of Grand Island and other islands in the Niagara River
near Buffalo.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling dismisses a 9-year-old lawsuit that residents of Grand
Island, a suburb of Buffalo, have long claimed has damaged business
and property values.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Richard Arcara's 215-page decision said the
Seneca Nation did not own the islands when it sold them to New York
in 1815, even though the Indian nation believed it did as a result of
a 1794 treaty.</LD>

<HD>Bush Promotes Fitness, Raises Millions in Florida</HD>
<DH>Politics: A fund-raiser will help his brother the governor,
who faces a tough reelection battle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>He was born in Connecticut, grew up in Texas and lives in Washington,
D.C., and his parents have a summer place in Maine. But these days,
President Bush could call Florida his second home.</LD>
<LD>   He was here a month ago, promoting a hard-line approach to Fidel
Castro's Cuba. He was back on Friday, this time telling senior
citizens that they can benefit from physical exercise--and reminding
the Republican Party faithful that his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush, could
benefit if they exercised their franchise.</LD>
<LD>   Since he took office, the president has made 10 visits to Florida,
a state that held the key to his 2000 election victory and is likely
to be important in 2004 as well. That's only three fewer visits than
he has made to his ranch in Texas.</LD>
<TE>   In Florida, as elsewhere, political fund-raising has become a
serious business for the president. Indeed, he devotes himself to it
with the intensity that his father, the 41st president, devoted to
golf.</TE>
<TE>   A Republican dinner he attended at the Universal Studios hotel
here was expected to pick up $2.5 million for the state party, deputy
White House press secretary Scott McClellan said.</TE>
<TE>   That brought Bush's fund-raising total over the 17 months of his
presidency to approximately $140 million--or better than $1.5 million
per week. This year alone, he and Vice President Dick Cheney have
helped Republican candidates and the party collect $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   Told by a reporter that his White House team has far outpaced Bill
Clinton in the money chase, Bush replied: "Thank you. I appreciate
that compliment."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Bush conducted presidential business--encouraging
senior citizens to take care of themselves--along with the politics.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the federal government will pay a share of his travel
costs. Otherwise, the Republican Party would have been charged the
full cost of his travel. It is a common approach used by other
presidents too.</TE>
<TE>   During a visit to the Marks Street Senior Recreation Complex, Bush
visited a class in aerobic "spinning"--high-speed pedaling on
stationary bikes.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, I want everybody exercising!" he said, and then wished one of
the participants, Julian Washington, a happy 86th birthday. Bush did
not take part in the workout.</TE>
<TE>   Later, he spoke to several hundred people, many of them elderly,
about the war on terrorism and, for five minutes of his 16-minute
address, the benefits of a healthy lifestyle.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to have a healthy life, you've got to be careful of
what you eat," the president said.</TE>
<TE>   "You need to eat your vegetables. And your fruits. We've been
working on Dad for a while on the broccoli issue," he said,
resurrecting his father's well-known distaste for that vegetable.</TE>
<TE>   "Take advantage of preventative screenings," he said. "And
exercise.</TE>
<TE>   "I sleep better, I eat better. I'm a lot more pleasant fellow to
be around after I exercise. And I encourage all Americans to do so,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Older Americans have more to gain from regular exercise than
younger Americans, but nearly 70% of those aged 65 to 74 engage in no
regular physical activity, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Just a stroll in the park for a reasonable period of time is
exercise, and it's good for you," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   The president is putting a spotlight on health and exercise this
week.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, he presided at a fitness exposition on the White
House South Lawn, as staff members and others went through exercise
routines. This morning he will be the star attraction in a three-mile
run at a Washington military base.</TE>
<TE>   His participation poses a pesky problem for the dozens of White
House aides and others who have signed up to take part: What protocol
governs passing the 55-year-old president in a three-mile race?</TE>
<TE>   "The president is looking forward to a competitive race. I think
he expects all the participants to run their hardest," McClellan
said.</TE>
<TE>   The propriety of outshining the president may be moot for many.
Bush claims a 6:45 mile, and McClellan observed that the president
has been running three miles in as little as 20 minutes, 35 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Bush was not always so gung-ho on the subject of a healthy
lifestyle. He has addressed gingerly his partying before he was 40.
Now he says he no longer drinks alcoholic beverages.</TE>
<TE>   His younger brother, the governor, said in introducing him here
that the president is the fittest member of the Bush family. But, Jeb
Bush couldn't resist pointing out, it wasn't always so.</TE>
<TE>   It was a sibling's poke at the senior Bush, who has been doing
everything he can to smooth his brother's way to a second term in the
governor's mansion.</TE>
<TE>   The president's chief political advisor, Karl Rove, made clear in
a private presentation to supporters this month, which found its way
into print, that the race in Florida was one of 15 contests this
November the GOP could well lose.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush sought Friday to help his brother, telling donors
at the evening fund-raiser that "anything I can do to help Jeb stay
in the governor's office, I'll do."</TE>
<TE>   Back in Washington, Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry
McAuliffe objected to the way Bush mixed fund-raising and fitness in
Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "From the $100-million man comes the $150,000 workout," McAuliffe
said. "Today, President Bush flew 800 miles, to raise [more than] $2
million, and expects the taxpayers to pick up the $150,000 tab
because he watched an eight-minute workout."</TE>

<LD>On a day when President Bush was promoting the benefits of a healthy
lifestyle--including a proper diet--here was one of the lunch
offerings aboard Air Force One: corned beef sandwiches, steak fries
and strawberry cheesecake.</LD>
<LD>   Bush flew from Washington to Orlando on Friday to speak at a
political fund-raiser and visit a senior citizen center, where his
theme was physical fitness.</LD>
<LD>   ''People need to be conscious of their diet. They need to be
careful not to be loading up with fatty foods all the time,'' he said
at the center.</LD>
<TE>   On the flight down, he passed on the corned beef and asked his Air
Force steward for an egg salad on toast and a diet Coke, deputy White
House press secretary Scott McClellan said.</TE>
<TE>   Others mindful of their intake of fats were offered tuna salad and
chicken salad.</TE>

<HD>Votes on Taxes, Abortion Put Key Issues in Spotlight</HD>
<DH>Politics: The House and Senate, focusing on November, take
up causes important to their bases. Making laws is not necessarily
the motivation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- With lawmakers keen to highlight political differences
rather than cut legislative deals, the House voted Friday to expand
retirement-account tax breaks while the Senate voted to support
abortion rights for women in the U.S. military.</LD>
<LD>   Neither measure is given much chance of becoming law this year.
But as is often the case with issues such as abortion and taxes--and
with fall elections approaching--lawmaking isn't necessarily the
point.</LD>
<LD>   ''This is red meat for the true believers,'' said Marshall
Wittmann, a congressional analyst at the Hudson Institute, a
conservative think tank. ''These are important votes to
constituencies that both parties need to turn out in November.''</LD>
<TE>   The bill the House passed was the latest in a series of
tax-cutting measures pushed through the chamber by the Republican
majority. But major tax legislation has gone nowhere this year in the
Democratic-led Senate, and no breakthrough appears imminent.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, for example, the Senate rejected an effort to extend a
repeal of the estate tax--a vote that appeared to bury the chances
that any further significant tax legislation will be enacted by the
107th Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Still, on a 308-70 vote, the House on Friday approved a bill
sponsored by Reps. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Benjamin L. Cardin
(D-Md.) that would make permanent provisions in last year's tax cut
related to retirement savings.</TE>
<TE>   Under the $1.35-trillion, 10-year tax cut enacted at President
Bush's urging, Congress gradually raised the amount of money
taxpayers can contribute to tax-favored retirement accounts.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the limit on transfers to individual retirement
accounts will rise in steps, from $3,000 currently to $5,000 a year
by 2008. And the annual limit on tax-deferred contributions to
employer-sponsored 401(k) and similar savings plans will rise from
the current $11,000 to $15,000 by 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Those and other retirement-related tax breaks, like the rest of
the sweeping tax cut law, are scheduled to expire on Dec. 31, 2010.
As a result, tax rules and rates in effect in 2001 will resume in
2011. For instance, annual contributions to IRAs will revert to
$2,000.</TE>
<TE>   That was the result of a political compromise that enabled Bush
and his GOP allies to bypass Senate obstacles last year on their way
to winning approval of the largest tax cut in a generation. But since
the law took effect, the federal budget has plunged back into
recession. For these reasons and others, Democrats have argued that
making key parts of the tax cut permanent would be irresponsible. But
House Republican leaders have forged ahead, positioning their party
as an advocate for more tax relief.</TE>
<TE>   ''This is the sixth bill that House Republicans have passed this
year to provide Americans permanent tax relief, and one more chance
for the Senate to do the right thing,'' said House Majority Leader
Dick Armey (R-Texas).</TE>
<TE>   In the vote, 115 Democrats joined 192 Republicans and one
independent to approve the bill. No Republicans were opposed.</TE>
<TE>   But House Democratic leaders also sought to score political points
by forcing a vote on an alternative measure that would crack down on
corporations and executives that seek to take advantage of overseas
tax shelters. Republicans provided most of the votes to defeat the
measure, 204 to 182, but House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt
(D-Mo.) claimed his party was on the right side of an increasingly
prominent issue: corporate accountability.</TE>
<TE>   ''By their continued opposition to strong, sensible steps and by
their continued allegiance to multimillion-dollar corporate special
interests, the Republican majority is guilty of enabling corporate
excesses that have done such harm,'' Gephardt said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Senate, Democrats spotlighted the issue of abortion rights
during debate on a $393-billion defense authorization bill. The
amendment, sponsored by Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), would allow
women who serve in the U.S. military to obtain privately funded
abortions at military installations overseas.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, those women who want an abortion must get approval from
a commanding officer to return to the United States for the
procedure--or must seek to have it in a nonmilitary facility in the
host country.</TE>
<TE>   Five Republicans--Sens. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, Arlen
Specter of Pennsylvania, Ted Stevens of Alaska and Susan Collins and
Olympia Snowe of Maine--joined 46 Democrats and one independent in
approving the amendment. California's two Democratic senators, Dianne
Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, both voted for it.</TE>
<TE>   The House has already rejected a similar amendment, however, and
the Bush administration does not support it. That makes enactment
highly unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   But the senators who voted for the measure got an immediate payoff
from abortion-rights supporters. Gloria Feldt, president of Planned
Parenthood Federation of America, hailed the Senate for taking ''a
key step towards protecting the health and rights of those
servicewomen overseas who protect our freedom.''</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, Friday's votes may ultimately serve more than
election-year purposes. Frequently, passage of major legislation
requires many roll calls over several years in Congress. But with
control of the narrowly divided House and Senate at stake in the fall
elections, many more votes in the coming weeks are destined to become
political fodder.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, for instance, the House expects to take up a bill to
help provide prescription drug coverage for the elderly. The bill was
approved Friday by the House Energy and Commerce Committee and sent
on to the full House. Although the Senate is likely to approve its
own version of that bill, lawmakers are showing little sign that they
are ready to cut a bipartisan deal to get the legislation to the
president.</TE>

<HD>Man Sought in Utah Found in W.Va.</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The drifter wanted for questioning in the kidnapping of 14-year-old
Elizabeth A. Smart was caught Friday at a West Virginia hospital
after checking himself in under a fake name with drug-related liver
failure.</LD>
<LD>   The capture of Bret Michael Edmunds, 26, shed no immediate light
on Elizabeth's abduction June 5. Edmunds was being held on a federal
warrant charging him with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution for
violating probation in Utah on charges unrelated to the Smart case.
He has been considered a fugitive since October.</LD>
<LD>   But authorities investigating the kidnapping said they hoped to
talk with Edmunds and search his car.</LD>
<TE>   "We are anxious to look at him in all aspects of this case to find
out if he's a suspect," Salt Lake City Police Chief Rick Dinse said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Edmunds was in serious condition in the intensive care
unit at City Hospital in Martinsburg, W.Va., more than 2,000 miles
from Salt Lake City. Authorities said he has been in and out of
consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a possibility that he could be critical to the point
where he might not survive," the police chief said. Relatives of the
Smart family said they hoped Edmunds might provide a break in the
case.</TE>
<TE>   "You've heard the term 'emotional roller-coaster,' " said Dave
Smart, Elizabeth's uncle. "We're not going to hang our hats on
anything until we have Elizabeth in our hands."</TE>
<TE>   The teenager was taken at gunpoint from her bedroom. Her
9-year-old sister, Mary Katherine, is the only witness to the
abduction.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities across the country had been looking for Edmunds
because a Salt Lake City milkman recalled seeing a suspicious car
near the Smart home two days before the kidnapping. The milkman
recalled part of the license plate number and passed it along to
police, who linked the information to Edmunds.</TE>
<TE>   Those license plates, stolen from another car, were found last
week on a road north of Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   In Martinsburg, hospital spokeswoman Teresa McCabe said Edmunds
showed up at the emergency room about 5:15 a.m. Thursday. He
allegedly gave hospital workers his mother's name and a valid
telephone number, which led to his identification.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Edmunds had given the hospital an alias. They
also said he was being treated for a possible drug overdose, but they
did not identify the drug.</TE>
<TE>   "All along, Mr. Edmunds is someone we've wanted to talk to," Dinse
said. "He's a question mark, and we want to put a period on that
question mark."</TE>
<TE>   Police have more than 400 leads, some of them promising, Dinse
said, but "we don't have a clear suspect in any one of them."</TE>
<TE>   A vehicle fitting the description of the Saturn sedan Edmunds was
driving was found in the hospital's parking lot. West Virginia state
police impounded the car, which will be searched for clues in the
case, Dinse said.</TE>

<HD>Priest Accused of Rape in N.Y. Is Held in Texas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A Roman Catholic priest was arrested Friday in Texas on charges of
raping a woman two years ago while working in the Brooklyn Diocese.</LD>
<LD>   Cyriacus Udegbulem, 39, a visiting priest from Nigeria, was on a
list of about 35 priests the Brooklyn Diocese gave prosecutors this
year because they had been accused of sexual misconduct.</LD>
<LD>   Udegbulem was arrested in Laredo, Texas, where he was living. The
bishop of Laredo, James Tamayo, issued a statement saying Udegbulem
had worked at the church's health center from March 2000 to August
last year, but that he was not employed as a priest in the Diocese of
Laredo.</LD>
<TE>   Udegbulem formerly worked in a parish in the Brooklyn Diocese. The
alleged victim said the priest raped and sodomized her during a
meeting in 2000, Dist. Atty. Charles Hynes said.</TE>
<TE>   The priest admitted to the diocese that he engaged in
inappropriate sexual behavior, but the woman said she did not want to
report the assault, diocese spokesman Frank DeRosa said.</TE>
<TE>   The diocese immediately revoked Udegbulem's authority to perform
priest duties there, and he left a few days later, DeRosa said.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't immediately known if Udegbulem had an attorney.</TE>

<HD>Thin Line on Rights in Federal Terror Probes</HD>
<DH>Security: FBI director Mueller testifies to Congress on
efforts to protect Americans without overstepping new authority.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As his agents chased new tips about possible terrorist attacks, FBI
Director Robert S. Mueller III vowed Friday that the bureau would
watch ''very, very carefully'' to ensure that agents do not abuse
their newfound powers to fight terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   ''We have to be tethered to the Constitution and to the statutes
that enforce the privacy rights of our citizens,'' Mueller told a
congressional panel.</LD>
<LD>   Top Bush administration officials have characterized the FBI's
broadened powers to track terrorist suspects--including monitoring
public events and surfing the Internet without evidence of a
crime--as an essential reform with little or no downside.</LD>
<TE>   When the new FBI powers were announced last month by Atty. Gen.
John Ashcroft, Mueller described the changes as an important step to
''help remove unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles.''</TE>
<TE>   But Mueller offered a more sobering assessment Friday when quizzed
by several members of Congress, who were worried that unshackled
agents could overstep their authority.</TE>
<TE>   Although Mueller expressed his belief that the broadened powers
granted the FBI were an important tool in fighting terrorism, he also
noted that he was mindful of the FBI's history of civil rights
abuses. During J. Edgar Hoover's 48-year tenure as director, the
bureau routinely spied on and kept records on Communists, blacks,
radicals and other controversial political figures.</TE>
<TE>   "I think most people recognize the awesome power that you have as
an FBI agent to harm people,'' Mueller said. ''It is critically
important that as we obtain new authorities, that we have in place
mechanisms to assure that they are not being abused.''</TE>
<TE>   Although he said he believes that current training and internal
safeguards are sufficient to guard against abuses, Mueller noted that
there is a fine line between spying on a possible terrorist and
infringing on the rights of an innocent citizen.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to watch that very, very carefully,'' he said. "I want to
make certain that that change does not trigger some activity that we
would not want to see down the road.''</TE>
<TE>   Mueller's assessment came as the FBI warned of another possible
terrorist threat it has received--the latest in a long list of alerts
that have rattled the public since the Sept. 11 hijackings.</TE>
<TE>   In an alert issued Friday to law enforcement personnel nationwide,
the FBI said it had received ''uncorroborated information'' from
intelligence sources that terrorists might be looking to use fuel
tanker trucks against U.S. targets, according to a law enforcement
official.</TE>
<TE>   The threat includes the ''possible targeting'' of Jewish schools
or synagogues, said the official, who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   FBI headquarters in Washington urged field agents nationwide to
contact Jewish leaders in their communities, as well as trucking and
fuel facilities, to pass along the threat.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Los Angeles office of the Anti-Defamation League,
a leading Jewish group, discussed the threat Friday with the Los
Angeles Police Department and local rabbis. The group urged local
synagogues to be alert to any suspicious activity.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to be vigilant in maintaining calm and taking the
warning in context,'' said Sue Stengel, Western states counsel for
the Anti-Defamation League.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD spokesman Sgt. John Pasquariello said police would provide
''extra patrols'' and personally meet with people at ''high-profile
Jewish facilities and fuel depots.''</TE>
<TE>   In Las Vegas, meanwhile, the FBI termed as "not credible" a report
from a man who said his cell phone had picked up a conversation last
weekend among several men speaking cryptically in Arabic about what
he took to be a possible attack on Las Vegas on July 4.</TE>
<TE>   According to Michael Hamdan, 54, a native of Lebanon and an Arabic
speaker, one of the men he overheard said, ''We are going to hit them
on the day of freedom.''</TE>
<TE>   Hamdan agreed on Friday to a polygraph test, after which Special
Agent Daron W. Borst called the investigation "substantially
complete." Hamdan, a resident of Henderson, Nev., subsequently told
Associated Press that he had failed the test. The FBI would not
comment on the results.</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials have picked up numerous bits of uncorroborated
intelligence about possible July 4 threats and have been anxious
about a possible attack, perhaps involving subways and chemical or
biological weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the issue at Friday's hearing before a subcommittee of
the House Appropriations Committee, Mueller said: "We are
investigating that threat.''</TE>
<TE>   Mueller, outlining his plans for a remodeled FBI that will focus
more squarely on counter-terrorism, told the panel that the FBI must
"learn much more than we have in the past about Arab American
communities, Muslim American communities, Sikh American communities''
in order to fight terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   But he stressed that ''we protect the civil rights of everybody in
the United States.''</TE>
<TE>   That issue was of deep concern to several committee members, who
pushed for greater training and safeguards to prevent abuses.</TE>
<TE>   The effort to broaden the FBI's powers in the fight against
terrorism ''is unprecedented in American history. It could allow you
to do great harm if agents didn't watch their step,'' warned Rep.
Jose E. Serrano (D-N.Y.).</TE>
<TE>   Civil rights groups complain that Arab Americans have been
unfairly targeted in the FBI's terror probe, particularly in the
secret roundup of hundreds of people on immigration violations in the
weeks and months after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge last month barred the Justice Department from
enforcing a blanket policy on secret deportation hearings in those
immigration cases. But on Friday, the Justice Department appealed to
the U.S. Supreme Court to keep closed the hearings for some suspects.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department maintains that public disclosure would
compromise national security. But in a May 29 ruling, Chief Judge
John W. Bissell of the U.S. District Court in Newark, N.J., said such
hearings may only be closed on a case-by-case basis by the
immigration judge conducting the proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   An appellate court in Philadelphia rejected a Justice Department
appeal earlier in the week.</TE>

<DH>Nature: As the largest wildfire in Colorado's history
rages, flames cut an imaginary line: That on one side is destroyed,
all on the other is spared.</DH>

<LD>There is no official name for the line in the dirt that divides the
rambling timber house--clean and unscorched--and the smoking, charred
remains of forest just 10 feet away, the line where the fire burned
and smoked and raged, and then simply turned and moved elsewhere,
sparing the house.</LD>
<LD>   Many would call it the line of sheer chance. How else to explain
what a firestorm kills and what it passes by? Here at the Mountain
Communities Volunteer Fire Department, these were lines of war--the
place where dozens of firefighters stood in or near their own
neighborhoods, hacked out fire lines, hosed down woodpiles, hauled
out brush, and dared the largest wildfire in Colorado history to take
their own homes.</LD>
<LD>   By Friday, two sides of the fire station were ringed with a line
of scorched earth, and volunteer firefighters from all over the
timbered hill communities near here fanned out into the canyons,
stamping out still-smoldering ash piles, cutting down trees that
nursed fire deep inside them, and driving by their own homes to see
which had been saved and which had not.</LD>
<TE>   "We actually thought we lost our home the first time. It was
pretty emotional. Then, the fire came back, and by that time, it was,
'OK, you're either going to take my house or you're not. Just get on
with it so we can get on with doing our jobs,' " said Mary Reeder, a
volunteer paramedic supervisor and the mother of a preschooler, who
was on mop-up duty Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The 137,000-acre Hayman fire--still raging along a 100-mile-long
perimeter--passed through these communities twice in the last week.
Each time, volunteers and professional firefighters from nearby
Woodland Park, Manitou Springs and Colorado Springs put up a
ferocious defense, sometimes fighting to save a house as a
150-foot-tall wall of flame sweeping through the crowns of trees
roared over their heads only a few feet away.</TE>
<TE>   They set up firebreaks around homes, hosed down houses as a
firestorm that sounded like a freight train marched on their backs,
sometimes dropped and ran for their lives when the fire got too
close, came back and fought for the same house again when the
firestorm started to move on.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the statements that's been made is that firefighters were
running. It made it sound like some were heroes, and some weren't.
No, that's not the way it was. I know, because I was one of those who
ran," said Mike Dannenberg, who strategizes housing protection for
the Northern Rockies National Incident Management Team.</TE>
<TE>   "The house we got chased out of, one tree torched, another tree
torched, and within seconds all the trees torched. Yeah, we ran. We
didn't even have time to unplug the hose from the engine. We took off
dragging the hose, because of the heat of the thing," Dannenberg
said. "But I want to tell you that the firefighters up here were some
of the bravest firefighters I've ever seen. They were protecting
their neighbors' homes, and in some cases their own homes."</TE>
<TE>   When it was over, at least two firefighters had lost their homes.
Reeder, who had dropped off her 3-year-old daughter with her
husband's parents and came back to work, returned to her house after
the fire passed and found the line of fire within 30 feet of the side
door.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Henson, an 18-year-old volunteer, watched as his parents were
evacuated from the neighborhood and stayed behind to fight with the
department. He dropped by the house with a video camera shortly after
the fire so he could tell his parents of the family's fate: The shed
is gone, he said, but "the house is fine."</TE>
<TE>   Henson said firefighters spent most of the first week of the fire
preparing the Westcreek neighborhood's 60 or more houses for the
inevitable approach of the fire, making sure as much brush, wood, and
other fuel as possible was cleared away. Then, on Monday, as the fire
began to burn along the ridges behind the fire station, they gathered
around the station and waited. When burning ashes rained down on the
station house and the fire roared less than a quarter of a mile
behind them, they climbed into the trucks and drove down to a staging
area.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the most intense fire I've ever seen," said Tyler Lambert,
a professional station captain from the Northeast Teller Fire
Department who has been volunteering his days off on the wildfire.
"It was moving fast. It came from Sheep Nose to Trail Creek--two
miles--in 15 minutes."</TE>
<TE>   In nearby Turkey Rock Estates, a combination of volunteer and
professional firefighters mounted a daylong stand against a massive
firestorm that swept through Tuesday. In some cases they fought house
to house as it roared through the wooded drainage.</TE>
<TE>   Crews had come in five days earlier and triaged houses in the
subdivision--figuring which ones were hopeless, which ones were safe
and which ones could be saved with a little preventive action. When
the fire roared in Tuesday afternoon, four-member units were
dispatched to designated areas; a safety zone was identified where
they could retreat if things went bad. Then the fight began.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked like a quarter-mile of just torching trees just coming
right at us, and at that point there were just too many houses to
save," said Shane Coyne, an Air Force captain and part-time character
education instructor at the Air Force Academy. Coyne volunteers with
the El Paso County Wildfire Team.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell you, for the rest of my life I may never see something
like this again--I hope I don't," he said. "The fire is just such a
massive creature, it pretty much does what it wants. They show you
videos about what to do when something like that happens, they teach
you in class, but I was pretty much relying on the more experienced
people. When they said hang in there, we hung in there. When they
said let's break and run, we did."</TE>
<TE>   Carrick Patterson, a driver-engineer with the Manitou Springs Fire
Department, was one of several members of the Colorado Springs Strike
Team that made the stand at Turkey Rock. He tried to describe "an
entire canopy of trees up in flames."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any words to explain it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The air was so hot, strike team members said, that the smoke
itself was ablaze, forming its own walls of fire. Visibility was so
bad at times that they could see only inches in front of their faces.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the professionals on the team were city firefighters, many
of them from Colorado Springs, who were used to rushing to a house
fire in town and making an all-out effort to save it. Here, houses
were threatened all across a burning landscape.</TE>
<TE>   "When we're in the city and we lose a home, that's a kick in the
butt to a professional firefighter," Matthew Clark said. "And to see
several of 'em go, it's just--oh. Really hard."</TE>
<TE>   Individual units were hosing down houses in Turkey Rock as fire
loomed up and crested in the trees, literally over their heads. They
would back away, wait for the fire to retreat, then advance to the
now-burning house and trying to extinguish the flames.</TE>
<TE>   "We were there at a house putting out a spot fire. The fire would
go up into the crowns and go over us, and at that point we'd pull
back," Clark said.</TE>
<TE>   "We backed out of one house twice because of a crown fire and went
back in twice, and still saved that house. It was just a very
emotional thing for me."</TE>
<TE>   With the water in their engine units depleted, firefighters turned
to nearby ponds, a cistern, even hot tubs to refill their tanks. In
all, they used more than 14,000 gallons of water--but saved, by their
own rough estimate, the majority of the houses.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Reeder, a mechanical engineering technician and chief of the
Mountain Communities Volunteer Fire Department (his wife is the
paramedic supervisor), said they also were able to save the majority
of the houses in Westcreek.</TE>
<TE>   It has not come easy to the department. Of 20 volunteers normally
available, only 12 offered to fight the Hayman blaze. By now, they
are down to five. Some left to recover what remained of their burned
houses. Some, after two weeks, had to return to their regular jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "For some people, the magnitude of the fire is more than some of
them can handle," Reeder said. "But if it hadn't been for these
people in this area, the losses would have been staggering."</TE>
