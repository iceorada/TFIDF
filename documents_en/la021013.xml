<HD>Staying Put Is Rough for Some in Shanghai</HD>
<DH>Many fight to stay in older Shanghai homes, which city
wants to update with high-rises. They find their utilities
disrupted--and worse.</DH>

<LD>SHANGHAI -- Zhang and his 67-year-old mother were watching TV one
morning when the electricity in their one-bedroom apartment suddenly
went dead. Then the water cut off.</LD>
<LD>   The same thing happened to his neighbors, some of whom also have
had interruptions in their gas and cable TV.</LD>
<LD>   They blame the disruptions on a government-owned demolition
company that wants to clear out their run-down neighborhood in
central Shanghai to make way for a Hong Kong-financed high-rise.</LD>
<TE>   "They told us we would have to move no matter what, but we never
expected them to take such shameful measures," said Zhang, a
34-year-old hotel worker who asked that his full name not be used. He
is one of about 200 people who still live in the neighborhood despite
city orders to move.</TE>
<TE>   The company, Wuxing Real Estate Demolition &amp; Removal Co., which is
owned by Shanghai's Luwan district government, denied having anything
to do with the utility disruptions.</TE>
<TE>   Such disputes have become common in Shanghai, where many say an
unresponsive city government roughly shoves aside people who are seen
as standing in the way of progress.</TE>
<TE>   Block after block of crowded, gray-brick tenement housing has
given way to glittering skyscrapers and shopping malls as this
once-decaying city of 17 million people transforms itself into an
international business center.</TE>
<TE>   Although most people agree that changes in the city have been
good, they believe progress is sometimes imposed with a heavy hand.</TE>
<TE>   Zhang and others say the first disruptions of utilities began
during soccer's World Cup in June, when cable TV service stopped
right before key matches -- and resumed immediately after the games.</TE>
<TE>   It goes beyond that, though. Entire neighborhoods' fates are
decided by developers and city officials behind closed doors.
Residents wake up to find eviction notices on walls and power poles.
Government officials say they try to be understanding, but the
neighborhoods must go.</TE>
<TE>   "We do our best to persuade them and offer them fair compensation.
But if they refuse, the government has no choice but to guarantee the
city's development," said an official in Shanghai's public complaints
office, who gave only her surname, Xu.</TE>
<TE>   The evictions highlight the contradictions of a vibrant,
for-profit economy emerging in one of the world's last communist
regimes.</TE>
<TE>   As in capitalist countries, the disputes often revolve around
money. Relocated residents receive government compensation, but they
say it is not enough to rent or buy in the new buildings springing up
in their former neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the government, which under communist law still owns
most land, reaps big profits selling leases on the sites to
developers, many based overseas.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, China's one-party state gives people no avenue
to redress grievances. The same officials in charge of receiving
residents' complaints can be involved in the deals, while China's
courts lack independence.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't defeat a government-backed project in court," said Yang
Huali, a resident of another neighborhood that is fighting
development plans by a large state-owned company.</TE>
<TE>   Yang says city authorities failed to consult the 3,000 residents
before approving a cluster of 30-story apartment buildings scheduled
to go up next to their homes. They complain that the project will
occupy green space and block sunlight.</TE>
<TE>   One way to protest is to refuse to move. But it has its risks.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, thugs have roughed up holdouts. In one incident four
years ago, witnesses said, an elderly man was pushed from a
second-story window.</TE>
<TE>   Zhang's neighborhood, near downtown's trendy Xintiandi restaurant
and shopping district, is a labyrinth of dim, two-story buildings
built a century ago, when that section of town was ruled by the
French before the 1949 communist takeover. Most of the cramped
apartments lack toilets or baths.</TE>
<TE>   Residents and the government say about 90% of the neighborhood's
2,000 households accepted government compen- sation of about $55 a
square foot.</TE>
<TE>   The money let them move to modern high-rises on the city's
outskirts. But rooms in the new building in their old neighborhood,
to be built by Hong Kong-based Shui On Group, will cost more than
$275 a square foot -- far beyond their reach.</TE>
<TE>   "Shanghai's downtown is turning into a club for the rich," said
one resident, who asked that only his surname, Li, be used.</TE>
<TE>   Zhang said he and other neighbors will not back down.</TE>
<TE>   "We will fight until the government gives us a fair hearing," he
said.</TE>

<HD>6 Die, 55 Hurt in Blast at Finland Mall</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Matti Huuhtanen</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>VANTAA, Finland -- An explosion collapsed part of a building at a
mall filled with shoppers Friday evening, killing at least six people
and injuring 55, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Police said they didn't know what had caused the blast at the mall
in Vantaa, 10 miles north of Helsinki, but said they haven't ruled
out anything, including a possible bombing.</LD>
<LD>   The glass-enclosed mall was packed with up to 2,000 shoppers when
the explosion erupted near a staircase between the second and third
floors, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   "Glass fell down from the third floor, and children and parents
were in total panic when they saw the injured people," shopper
Orvokki Neuvonen said. "Mothers were screaming. Among the shattered
glass were [the] injured and unconscious."</TE>
<TE>   The injured, including 12 who were seriously hurt, were rushed to
several nearby hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the most serious accident since World War II in [the]
Helsinki [region]," said Eero Hirvensalo, a physician at Helsinki
University Central Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, officials suspected that the explosion was caused by
gas cylinders. But mall officials later said it was unlikely that any
were at the site.</TE>
<TE>   Police bomb squads with sniffer dogs were surveying the area,
which was expected to be cordoned off for several days.</TE>
<TE>   "We are talking to lots of people and we are not ruling out
anything at the moment," Deputy Chief Inspector Seppo Kujala of the
Vantaa police said when asked if a bomb could have caused the blast.
He said no one had been detained.</TE>
<TE>   Kujala said authorities found "lots of metal debris" at the site,
but would not speculate if it was part of an explosive.</TE>

<HD>Japan's Resistance to Daylight Saving Wanes</HD>
<DH>Proposal aims to save energy in a nation that is heavily
dependent on imported oil.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Natalie Obiko Pearson</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>TOKYO -- Much of the industrialized world may have switched to
daylight saving time decades ago, but it's still seen as a radical
idea by many in Japan -- and strongly resisted.</LD>
<LD>   It's not just the hassle of resetting clocks. Farmers fret that
cows will be thrown off schedule and won't give as much milk. Social
critics fear that children staying up later at night will turn into
delinquents.</LD>
<LD>   And there are worries that Japan's office workers, under social
pressure not to leave before dark, will end up spending even more
time at their jobs.</LD>
<TE>   But attitudes may be changing.</TE>
<TE>   The government proposed going to daylight saving time in 1998 as
part of the energy-saving guidelines drafted to meet the Kyoto
protocol on climate change. And daylight saving is increasingly being
seen as an environmental issue.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the daylight saving debate is set to become more lively,"
said Satoru Matsuda, spokesman for the Environment Agency. "Private
groups are starting to come together on their own to discuss it."</TE>
<TE>   Possibly the biggest obstacle has been history.</TE>
<TE>   Daylight saving time was imposed in 1948 under the American
occupation after Japan's defeat in World War II, but was so unpopular
that the Japanese voted it out in 1952. Its association with Japan's
postwar humiliation continued to stir up bitter opposition for years.</TE>
<TE>   Matsuda says the government wants to adopt daylight saving by
2008, citing the deadline set by the Kyoto protocol under which Japan
has committed to a 6% reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases.</TE>
<TE>   Changing to daylight saving could save 130 million gallons of oil
a year -- the equivalent of every Japanese household keeping its
lights off for a month, according to a study by the Energy
Conservation Center in Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   That would mean $664 million worth of annual energy savings, the
study said. The figure is on par with the $600 million that Mexico
says it saved since adopting daylight saving time in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Such figures are likely swaying many Japanese, whose country is
poor in natural resources and dependent on oil imports.</TE>
<TE>   In the most recent government poll in September 2001, 51% of
respondents supported the idea. Only 29% were decidedly against it --
down markedly from the 1952 post-occupation poll, when 53% opposed
it.</TE>
<TE>   The main reason given for backing the change had nothing to do
with recreation. Some 67% said it should be adopted to save energy,
while only 45% believed that more hours of daylight in the evening
would widen options for personal activities.</TE>
<TE>   When asked what effects people expected daylight saving time to
have, the top reasons were environmental -- from using less air
conditioning to helping stop global warming. The personal benefits
aren't discounted, however.</TE>
<TE>   "You wake up at 5 a.m. and it's already very light outside -- it's
a waste of time," said Taikan Oki, professor of environmental
resources engineering at Tokyo University. If daylight saving were
adopted, "it could have a real impact on people's lives."</TE>
<TE>   For Shunji Tashiro, an employee at NEC, the issue comes down to
golf: "Being able to tee up at 6 p.m. and hit a round after finishing
work -- it's really a very efficient use of daylight hours."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is convinced.</TE>
<TE>   "It's called 'savings' time, yet getting up so early for work that
it's still dark outside and turning on the lights, where's the saving
in that?" wrote a participant in a Web forum started by Tashiro.</TE>

<HD>Black-Market Money-Changers Thrive</HD>
<DH>Some economists say the illegal practice shows a failure of
Egyptian policy. They suggest letting the pound fall to market rates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jasper Mortimer</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CAIRO -- Every few weeks, Hossam Fahmy commits a crime. He delivers a
large number of Egyptian banknotes to a black marketeer who exchanges
them for dollars.</LD>
<LD>   "I wish not to buy from the black market, but sometimes you have
nothing else to do," said Fahmy, a store owner selling European
goods.</LD>
<LD>   Thousands of merchants and factory owners resort to the black
market to change money, risking 15 years in prison with hard labor.
They say they have no choice because Egypt's Central Bank drastically
limits the quantity of dollars that importers can legitimately
purchase.</LD>
<TE>   Economists say the black market represents a failure of government
policy. The Central Bank has devalued the Egyptian pound seven times
since mid-2000, cutting its value against the dollar by 32%
cumulatively. Yet the black market survives, showing that the pound
is still overvalued.</TE>
<TE>   If you need foreign currency, "forget the bank," said Albert
Iskandar, a retailer of European clothes who depends on the black
market for 90% of the euros he needs to pay for the goods he imports.</TE>
<TE>   "Egypt's monetary and foreign exchange policy is not satisfying
the demand for foreign exchange, and the lack of foreign exchange
constitutes a serious impediment to economic growth," the U.S.
Embassy said in its most recent review of the Egyptian economy.</TE>
<TE>   The Ministry of Foreign Trade and two members of the Central
Bank's board of governors did not respond to repeated requests for an
interview.</TE>
<TE>   In Cairo, it is difficult to find an exchange bureau that will
sell dollars across the counter. The quoted price for the dollar is
4.63 Egyptian pounds -- the weakest Central Bank rate -- but traders
know that they can get about 5 pounds for a dollar on the black
market.</TE>
<TE>   The black market is believed to operate in the back rooms of
exchange shops, export businesses and travel agents -- places that
receive foreign currency legitimately and then resell some of it at
rates higher than the Central Bank's.</TE>
<TE>   The government could wipe out the black market by allowing the
pound to fall to market rates. But devaluations lead to price
increases, which have provoked riots in Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   The government has cushioned the seven devaluations since mid-2000
by raising wages and subsidies of basic foodstuffs and medicines. In
July, civil servants got a raise of 10%, about three times the
inflation rate.</TE>
<TE>   But the higher cost of imports has had an impact.</TE>
<TE>   Dry cleaner Badawi Said said the devaluations have increased the
cost of solvent by 30%. He has not raised his prices so as not to
scare off customers, but he uses less solvent to clean clothing.</TE>
<TE>   Carpenter Emad Hamdi, who makes furniture in a small workshop in a
low-income district, said the cost of pine, imported from
Scandinavia, has risen 33%. He is passing the added cost for
materials on to his customers, but has tried to soften the blow by
reducing what he charges for his own labor. Nevertheless, business is
down 50%.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, we never had time for a rest. Now, we work and then we
rest," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Shoppers pushing carts around a supermarket in an affluent
district said they're buying in smaller quantities and opting for
Egyptian cosmetics instead of French.</TE>
<TE>   Taher Gargour, a Middle East analyst at HSBC bank in London, said
the general slowdown highlights the flaw in the argument that letting
the Egyptian pound's value float on the open market would hurt the
poor.</TE>
<TE>   Devaluation does make people poorer in the short term, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But what people fail to realize is that the alternative -- of
having a nonworking exchange rate, as we do now -- actually causes
impoverishment also," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Payments are delayed, people don't receive their wages, the job
market shrinks and economic growth fizzles, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Egypt's economy grew by as much as 5% a year in the late 1990s,
but it is estimated to have expanded only about 1% in the fiscal year
that ended June 30.</TE>
<TE>   Not all economists believe that Egypt should let the pound float
freely.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmed Galal, director of the Egyptian Center for Economic Studies,
argues that speculators would drive a floating pound to
unrealistically low levels.</TE>
<TE>   But both Galal and Gargour believe the Central Bank could go a
long way toward solving the foreign exchange problem by making more
foreign currency available, devaluing the pound to the current black
market rate, and widening the band within which the pound is allowed
to float around the central rate -- Galal suggests a deviation of 5%
to 7% instead of 3%.</TE>
<TE>   Gargour said the one devaluation that came close to success
occurred in August 2001. That was the only time the government
dropped the pound's value to the black market rate and guaranteed
that anybody who wanted to buy dollars at the official rate would get
them.</TE>
<TE>   The black market disappeared. But then came the attacks of Sept.
11, and the Central Bank reimposed restrictions.</TE>

<HD>Hyper-Congested New Delhi Looks to New Metro</HD>
<DH>In the hyper-congested city, rail system is eagerly
anticipated. Just getting it built was a monumental achievement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Sullivan</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW DELHI--It's the evening rush hour on the New Delhi stretch of the
Grand Trunk Road, the centuries-old highway that slices through the
Indian subcontinent, and things are fairly normal.</LD>
<LD>   If that's what you'd call it.</LD>
<LD>   Horns blare, buses bursting with passengers spew clouds of rancid
fumes, bicycles and motorized rickshaws weave through a thicket of
trucks, cars and horse carts. Off to one side, oblivious to the
chaos, a bicycle-rickshaw driver sleeps soundly, feet on his
handlebars. He's the only peaceful sight around.</LD>
<TE>   "Transportation here, we have some problems," shrugged Aziz Narvi,
a doctor walking home along the road. "Most of the time, I'm afraid
to drive."</TE>
<TE>   But things are changing in New Delhi, with a transportation
technocrat preaching a gospel of rapid-transit rail lines and even a
subway through the city's hyper-congested, ancient heart.</TE>
<TE>   "People will come over to our system," said E. Sreedharan,
managing director of Delhi Metro Rail Corp., ticking off the promises
of his soon-to-open network: "The ease of travel, the safety, the
lack of pollution."</TE>
<TE>   A new commuter railway line--an above-ground line in this area--is
being built parallel to the Grand Trunk, and more lines are going up
around the capital, where 16 million people and 4 million vehicles,
more than half of them two-wheelers of various sorts, fight for space
in the crush of traffic.</TE>
<TE>   In December, the first five miles of the planned 37-mile commuter
rail network is scheduled to open. By late 2005, the entire system is
supposed to be working, including seven miles of subways under
downtown New Delhi. The rest will either be surface or elevated
rails. Up to 2 million riders are expected to use the system daily.</TE>
<TE>   And maybe, just maybe, it will work.</TE>
<TE>   "Surprised? Surprised? We are very surprised. How have they
managed to complete this project?" asked an incredulous Subhash
Agarwal, a businessman waiting for a bus along the Grand Trunk.
"Nothing here works."</TE>
<TE>   India has a sprawling and often corrupt bureaucracy notorious for
spending billions of rupees and accomplishing little. New Delhi's
past transportation projects, mainly highway improvements that can
take years, have nearly frozen traffic in some neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the electricity required to power the rail system.
With power questionable through much of Delhi, real estate agents
highlight homes near those of top officials. Those neighborhoods,
they note, normally stay lighted at night.</TE>
<TE>   When ground was broken on the Metro in 1998, that alone was an
achievement. The idea was first raised in 1950, and 35 sets of plans
were drawn up and forgotten before work finally started.</TE>
<TE>   The public adores the idea--"We love this Metro," said Narvi. And
newspapers and magazines celebrate it. "Victory of the technocrats!"
one magazine proclaimed. "The good times are coming," declared The
Statesman newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Ask along the Grand Trunk Road, the ancient highway where, Kipling
once wrote, "all the world is going and coming," and you'll
understand the excitement. People talk of fume-fueled throat
infections, of frenzied drivers who view red lights as mere
suggestions, of commutes that can take three hours each way.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day I go by bus and every day I'm waiting," said Agarwal,
keeping an eye on the road for his ride. "Every morning I wait; every
evening I wait."</TE>
<TE>   At the Metro, the public company building the $1.7-billion
network, officials speak messianically about changing not just
traffic, but India's corporate and political culture.</TE>
<TE>   "Our attempt is to see this Metro as a model project," said
Sreedharan, a former civil engineer and longtime executive with the
Indian railway system, "so this culture spreads to the rest of the
country."</TE>
<TE>   The chance of one project melting away decades of entrenched
bureaucracy is slim. But Sreedharan and his team have proven one
thing: that with the support of top government officials, subway
builders from around the world and millions of dollars in
low-interest Japanese loans, it is possible to stay on schedule and
withstand the political cronyism that plagues other government
projects.</TE>
<TE>   Not that politicians don't try: "Day in, day out, every day I get
the pressure," Sreedharan said, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   But if the public and Metro officials are waiting feverishly for
the first train, others are far more wary.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners whose land was seized for construction have filed more
than 200 lawsuits against the system, although so far courts have
sided with the Metro. Also, although Metro officials insist they have
taken care to protect historic architecture, some conservationists
fear what so much construction could mean for Delhi.</TE>
<TE>   "The heritage is so vulnerable," said architectural
conservationist Nalini Thakur. She said that while the ancient
monuments are mostly protected, there is plenty of more recent but
still historically important architecture that could suffer.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole Metro is such a massive project, it's running over all
of Delhi ... ," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Urban planners warn that the Metro will bring no miracles and say
much of the benefit will be to people who already travel directly
along the system's rail corridors.</TE>
<TE>   Commuters forced "to hang out of the bus now might feel they're
benefiting, but traffic is not going to undergo a sea change," said
A.K. Sharma, a traffic expert at New Delhi's School of Planning and
Architecture.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he concedes a Metro is desperately needed. Traffic is
growing so bad in Delhi that someday, he said, "the city will just
stop functioning."</TE>
<TE>   As for electricity, the vagaries of New Delhi's network don't
worry Metro officials, who say the system will link directly to power
suppliers and have multiple backup systems.</TE>
<TE>   But in New Delhi, it's impossible to completely escape the
outages.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon, senior Metro advisor S.M. Mittal sat at his
desk proclaiming the rail system's superiority.</TE>
<TE>   On his windowsill was a specially made digital clock counting down
the days until the first train rolls. The screen of Mittal's clock
was blank. "We've been having some power outages recently," he
explained.</TE>

<HD>Identifying MIA Remains Is an Uphill Task in Vietnam</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Thurber</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>HANOI -- Spread on the table in front of the Vietnamese army officer
are a corroded belt buckle, a few handmade buttons and a watch with
its hands frozen at 7:15.</LD>
<LD>   They are parts of a puzzle that Maj. Nguyen Thi Tien hopes will
help her identify the remains of some of the nearly 300,000 soldiers
her government says are still missing in action from the Vietnam War.</LD>
<LD>   The meager personal belongings found with unearthed remains are
one of the few ways that Vietnam can identify its dead since
communist forces kept only simple records for regular soldiers and
often none at all for guerrilla fighters.</LD>
<TE>   "It's very different from how American MIA investigators do it,"
Tien said. "We don't have much to go on."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. teams searching for the 1,905 Americans still listed as
missing in action from the Vietnam War -- including 1,441 inside
Vietnam -- can match DNA to medical records.</TE>
<TE>   But there are few such records for Vietnam's MIAs.</TE>
<TE>   When Vietnamese search teams are lucky, they find hastily carved
grave markers made from pieces of aluminum from downed American
planes or other metal scraps, Tien said.</TE>
<TE>   One soldier's body was identified after Tien arranged for a
photograph found in a shirt pocket to be published in a newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   It was seen by a family member and identified by the dead man's
mother, Tien said.</TE>
<TE>   Another soldier was identified through a New Year's card he
carried that carried the message, "I will keep waiting for you until
you return. New Year 1968."</TE>
<TE>   While Vietnam and the United States have held 71 joint
investigations to trace missing Americans, the United States has done
little to help the Vietnamese search.</TE>
<TE>   That is now changing, U.S. Ambassador Raymond Burghardt said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's finally a two-way street," he said. "About two years ago,
the Vietnamese side said they'd like to get serious about accounting
for their missing. Since then, we've provided technical assistance
and thousands of pages of documents."</TE>
<TE>   Vietnamese forensic specialists have had training in DNA methods,
and three archivists were brought to the United States to research
American files, said Lt. Col. Steve Hawley, commander of the U.S. MIA
office in Hanoi.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the United States turned over additional records of
"where we think we killed and buried Vietnamese," Hawley said.</TE>
<TE>   But Le Quang Bay, deputy director of the government's Department
of War Invalids and Martyr Affairs, said DNA training and documents
are of limited use.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if you have a piece of a bone to identify, Vietnam has no
records with which to match it," he said. "The war was a long time
ago, and the terrain has changed a lot because of weather conditions,
and many of the records have proved inaccurate."</TE>
<TE>   Although prospects for identifying most are bleak, Vietnam has
expanded its search in recent years for the many soldiers believed to
have been buried in temporary graves at old battle sites.</TE>
<TE>   In a country where ancestor worship is an unofficial religion,
identifying and properly burying the dead is a high priority. But
poverty, political turmoil and military conflicts with neighboring
Cambodia and China for years prevented Vietnam from launching a
full-scale search.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, 18,527 sets of remains have been repatriated from
Laos and about 3,600 from Cambodia, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   The government says about 3 million Vietnamese, including
civilians, were killed in the war. About 1 million were communist
combatants, and remains of about 700,000 have been recovered, Bay
said, but only 40% of these have been identified.</TE>
<TE>   Row after row of graves in more than 3,000 special war cemeteries
throughout the country are marked "Unknown Martyr."</TE>
<TE>   Vietnam's communist government does not keep records of missing or
dead soldiers who fought for the defeated South Vietnamese
government, and their bodies are not allowed in the war cemeteries,
Bay said.</TE>
<TE>   About 58,200 Americans were killed in the conflict. Accounting for
the 1,905 missing Americans has been a cornerstone issue in
U.S.-Vietnamese relations since the two countries began a tentative
detente in the late 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Tien, 46, is a quiet-spoken former teacher who says her seven
brothers and brothers-in-law fought in the war. One brother-in-law
was killed 1972 and his remains weren't found until 20 years later,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Tien said she became interested in identifying soldiers' remains
while working as a guide in an army museum in Vinh, a North
Vietnamese city that was almost destroyed by American bombing during
the war.</TE>
<TE>   She noticed that many belongings found with the remains of
soldiers were being reburied along with the bodies in war cemeteries,
and suggested two years ago that they should be kept for possible
future identification.</TE>
<TE>   In the first year, she was able to use the belongings to identify
38 sets of remains, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Each time I'm able to identify someone, I can't sleep, I can't
eat," Tien said. "It gives me strength to continue on. And I think we
may have to continue forever."</TE>

<HD>Some Visitors Do a Disappearing Act When Journeying to
Tijuana</HD>
<DH>Its seedier areas attract people who vanish forever.
Authorities can provide little assistance as desperate families
search for answers.</DH>

<LD>TIJUANA -- Stepping off a ship in San Diego, David Provost headed
south into this border city, where rowdy nightclubs have lured young
Americans for generations. But Provost, a 20-year-old merchant seaman
from Florida, never returned.</LD>
<LD>   More than a month later, authorities have found no trace of him in
hospitals, jails or the morgue. Relatives turned up disturbing clues
on their own, leaving them fearful and frustrated. His ship, the USNS
Bold, set sail without him.</LD>
<LD>   "If David was just out there roaming around, he would have called,
asked for money or something," said Pat Provost, his grandmother. "He
wouldn't just disappear."</LD>
<TE>   Now, as the family in Lutz, Fla., shops around for private
investigators and calls anyone they think might help find Provost,
they live in the anguished limbo that has become typical for
relatives of people who disappear in the often chaotic and
crime-plagued cities of the Mexican border.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows how many Americans are reported missing each year in
Mexico. In Tijuana alone, the U.S. Consulate gets about 1,200
requests a year to either find or check on U.S. citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Many of these requests are quickly resolved or become irrelevant
when someone who has been reported missing returns from a
longer-than-planned vacation.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes they never turn up and we never know what happened,"
said Al Anzaldua, the chief of the U.S. citizen services section at
the consulate.</TE>
<TE>   The citizen services section in Tijuana is busier than any other
U.S. consulate in the world. On average, five Americans are arrested
and one dies in its territory each day, leaving them little time to
spend chasing down an adult who has vanished in the sprawling
metropolis.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican authorities can offer only limited assistance. In Tijuana,
state police themselves are overwhelmed with a high murder rate and a
large number of missing adults, many of them migrants from the
interior of the country who disappear in the border region.</TE>
<TE>   The Provost family and many others also file missing persons
reports with the San Diego police, who can do little more than check
area hospitals and contact liaison officers in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't do anything. It's another country. Our jurisdiction ends
at the border," said Kathy Bolen, an investigator with the San Diego
police missing adults unit.</TE>
<TE>   The reports Bolen receives tend to involve men who were last seen
in the strip clubs and discos along the main tourist drag, Revolution
Avenue, or the even seedier Zona Norte, where prostitution is
practiced openly and alcohol is served all night.</TE>
<TE>   A 29-year-old construction worker and bartender, Jeffrey Scolny,
left his San Diego apartment for a night out in Tijuana in 1997 and
never came home. His mother flew out from New Jersey, posting fliers
with his photo and contacting all local authorities, but turned up
nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, a coroner's assistant read an account of Scolny's
disappearance in a Mexican newspaper and recognized the description
of his jewelry and tattoos of a tiger head and skulls. He checked the
records and discovered that the construction worker had been found
beaten to death in an alley but had been misclassified as a Mexican
and thus never reported to U.S. authorities.</TE>
<TE>   In March, Allen Bigham, a 43-year-old assistant manager of a Home
Depot in the San Diego area, took a taxi to Tijuana and hasn't been
seen since. His father took all the official steps and sent friends
down to post fliers with his photos.</TE>
<TE>   They found no trace of him, and his bank and retirement accounts
are untouched, said his father, also named Allen. "If he's been
killed, no one seems to know about it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Provost's family fears that he has been the victim of a crime.
Authorities won't speculate about his fate but acknowledge the
possibility, given the gritty reality of the border city, which is
the base of operations for drug traffickers and immigrant smugglers.</TE>
<TE>   "All kinds of things could have happened," Anzaldua said. "You get
everything here from homicides to drug overdoses to all kinds of
crime."</TE>
<TE>   In the city of about 1.5 million people, there were about 300
reported homicides last year, many a result of Tijuana's role in the
cross-border drug trade. Nearby San Diego, with a roughly equal
population, had 51 murders during the same period.</TE>
<TE>   There have been so many problems over the years that the U.S.
Marine Corps and the Navy now require junior enlisted personnel to
get permission before heading south of the border. They are urged to
travel in groups.</TE>
<TE>   Provost, like the rest of the crew on the USNS Bold, was advised
to avoid Mexico, according to police and officials with Maersk Line
Ltd., a Norfolk, Va., company that operates the ocean surveillance
vessel under a contract with the Navy.</TE>
<TE>   A crew member traveled to the edge of Tijuana with him, then
turned back when Provost headed off to the main tourist drag, said
Bolen, who spoke to the ship's captain. "I think he probably got in
over his head," she said. "I don't know where or how."</TE>
<TE>   He was last seen Aug. 21. Over the next two days, there were a
series of ATM withdrawals in Tijuana from his bank account, totaling
about $1,400. Then, nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "He would never spend that much money in two days. It's alien to
him," said Pat Provost, his grandmother, a retired bank clerk.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband and son-in-law traveled to Tijuana to search for him.
Someone used Provost's credit card in a hotel in a particularly
notorious section of the city known as a haven for smugglers and
gangs. But it was not the seaman's signature on the receipt.</TE>
<TE>   Oddly, his driver's license arrived by mail at his parents' home
in an unmarked envelope, bearing a San Diego postmark.</TE>
<TE>   The shipping company notified Provost's union but officials don't
know what to make of the disappearance of a seaman with a good
record.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope he turns up safe and sound somewhere," said Brad Sauer,
president of Maersk. "We did all we could with our resources."</TE>
<TE>   The consulate has dealt with kidnappings and fake abductions, in
which people try to extort money from their own families. He's heard
of cases in which people didn't want their families to know they had
been arrested and sent to a Mexican prison. Or they simply want to
disappear.</TE>
<TE>   The Provost family refuses to believe that possibility. They have
spread fliers around the area and plan to enlist the help of a
private investigator.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just so worried," his grandmother said. "I keep praying."</TE>

<HD>As Tough Firefighting Season Ends, Another Looms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BOISE, Idaho -- The multicolored drought map on the National
Interagency Fire Center's Internet site depicts an angry burn across
the face of the West.</LD>
<LD>   The shades run from yellow, indicating moderate drought in the
Midwest and Northern California, to the dark browns and reds of
extreme drought in the Rockies and Southwest. There is a similar,
smaller burn on the central Eastern Seaboard.</LD>
<LD>   Several years of parched weather set the stage for a firestorm
that took six months to end in the northern mountains. And long-range
weather forecasts warn of a warm, dry winter in much of the West,
suggesting another bad season in 2003.</LD>
<TE>   "In terms of major, large wildfires, it's probably over except in
Southern California," said Rick Ochoa, National Weather Service
meteorologist at the center, which oversees national fire
suppression.</TE>
<TE>   The dry Santa Ana winds that rush from the Great Basin of Nevada
and Utah and help incinerate the canyons and valleys of Southern
California typically blow until February. But even with drought,
cooler temperatures and early signs of winter, rain and snow have
lowered the immediate risk from the Northwest into the Rocky
Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   This year's fires blackened 6.6 million acres, less than the 8.4
million acres in 2000 but still about twice the 10-year average. Fire
Center spokesman Don Smurthwaite said 18,000 firefighters were on the
lines throughout the season.</TE>
<TE>   The 2002 fires in the West were notable for burning in the "red
zone," the new buzzword for the urban-wild land interface of homes
built into the forest.</TE>
<TE>   The largest, Oregon's Biscuit Fire, burned nearly 500,000 acres
and put 17,000 people on evacuation alert. Colorado fires scorched
about 500,000 acres, destroying 1,000 structures and forcing 81,000
people from their homes. The 469,000-acre Rodeo-Chediski fire in
Arizona destroyed at least 467 homes.</TE>
<TE>   Smurthwaite said about 2,600 homes and other buildings have burned
this year.</TE>
<TE>   "You take more risks when someone's life is on the line," said
Grant Beebe, whose smoke-jumping teams fought fires in the red zone
around Canon City and Pueblo, Colo. "With property, you try not to
take an extraordinary risk, but it happens."</TE>
<TE>   The fires of 2002 also raised issues of safety and prevention.</TE>
<TE>   Three people died in the June crash of a C-130A retardant tanker
on a fire at Walker, Calif., and two were killed when a World War
II-era PB4Y-2 broke apart in Colorado in July.</TE>
<TE>   Forest Service officials say a new blue-ribbon panel, led by Jim
Hall, former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, is
conducting the most thorough review ever of the agency's aerial
firefighting program to date. The average age of the fleet is
approaching 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   Many foresters say one reason the season was so severe was because
decades of firefighting allowed a buildup of brush and other fuels in
the forest that, centuries ago, would have burned off in smaller,
lightning-sparked fires before it could accumulate.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration is pushing its "Healthy Forests"
initiative, allowing private companies to cut some large trees in
exchange for thinning smaller trees and brush.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists call it a blanket exemption from public appeals
against logging on 10 million acres of high-risk forest. Bills
addressing the problem are pending in Congress, but are mired in the
debate.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials say a century of fire suppression helped
create that fuel build-up, but allowing small blazes to roar across
millions of acres in mid-August is not the solution either.</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa said the nation will experience the effects of a revived El
Nino, the temperature engine in the tropical Pacific Ocean that
affects weather across the globe.</TE>
<TE>   The fall outlook is for continued dry weather for the Pacific
Northwest. The desert Southwest and Southern California will be
warmer than normal.</TE>
<TE>   The winter outlook includes below-normal rain and snow from the
Northwest to the western Dakotas. Temperatures will be above normal
in the northern tier and southeastern Alaska.</TE>

<LD>SPACE CENTER, Houston -- As soon as Duane "Digger" Carey sat down for
his interview, the astronaut-selection committee popped the question:
What have you done since high school?</LD>
<LD>   It was a simple query meant to relax astronaut wannabes, but Carey
had fretted over his answer for days.</LD>
<LD>   Should he tell this roomful of strangers -- hotshot astronauts and
other NASA bigwigs -- how he slept through high school because he was
working 40 hours a week to save up for a motorcycle? How he hit the
road on his new Suzuki as soon as he got his diploma and spent the
next 2 1/2 years bumming around? How he hitchhiked and jumped freight
trains from state to state?</LD>
<TE>   Sure, Carey eventually became an Air Force officer, flew combat in
the Gulf War, racked up a pair of engineering degrees, and even
home-schooled his two kids in math and science. But would NASA want a
former railroad bum and eternal motorcycle nut for a space shuttle
pilot when all those straight-A, straight-arrow, strait-laced types
were available?</TE>
<TE>   Carey talked it over with his wife and stepfather. Be honest, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   It was Oct. 18, 1995, and the first week of interviews at Johnson
Space Center for NASA's Astronaut Class of '96.</TE>
<TE>   "I was telling them stories about one of my hitchhiking travels,
and hopping trains and traveling around as a railroad bum," recalled
Carey, 45.</TE>
<TE>   An hour passed and he hadn't even talked about college yet. He
hadn't talked about his professional accomplishments or being a pilot
in the Air Force.</TE>
<TE>   His time was up.</TE>
<TE>   "I told my wife that night, 'Baby, if they hire me, they know
exactly what they're getting.' "</TE>
<TE>   NASA did hire him, along with 34 other new recruits.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe some folks think they [NASA officials] have an elitist
attitude, but I'm here to tell you they don't," says Carey, a child
of the housing projects of St. Paul, Minn., and the first person in
his family to go to college -- let alone space. (His mother, who had
three children by age 21, never finished high school and worked as a
beautician.)</TE>
<TE>   In March, with his family proudly looking on, Carey flew to the
Hubble Space Telescope as the pilot of shuttle Columbia. The
successful repair job earned the crew a ticket to the White House and
a meeting with President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The moral of Carey's story, which he occasionally shares with
schoolchildren: A slacker can always shift gears and, with hard work
and lofty goals, go from goofing off to lifting off.</TE>
<TE>   There is one caveat. "Don't wait too long," cautioned the head of
NASA's astronaut-selection office, Duane Ross. He could see Carey
"had his head screwed on right" and had proven himself.</TE>
<TE>   Many candidates are alike, Ross said. "But Digger was different.
He had obviously learned a lot in the stuff he was doing, even though
it wasn't textbook kind of stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Seven years later, Carey remains unique among the 310 men and
women hand-picked over the decades as U.S. astronauts. Many space
fliers begin shooting for the stars almost straight from grade
school, stockpiling degrees and building resumes to wow NASA.</TE>
<TE>   Carey didn't even plan to go to college. All he wanted to do was
ride motorcycles, an obsession that began at age 13. By then, he had
sworn off shoplifting.</TE>
<TE>   His favorite courses at St. Paul's Highland Park High were "ones
that involved getting away from school."</TE>
<TE>   Instead of being the perfect student, Carey slept through most of
his classes. He worked from 5 p.m. until 1 a.m. as a busboy, got up
at 6 a.m. for a breakfast of iced coffee and No-Doz, went to school
and started the whole cycle over again.</TE>
<TE>   Now he jokes that it was good preparation for the long, exhausting
days he endured during the Hubble mission.</TE>
<TE>   Other would-be astronauts never would have slacked off or taken a
break for fun. But the young, transient Carey slept in strangers'
backyards, fixed typewriters and worked as a bartender to subsidize
his motorcycle trips. Thankfully, he didn't have any money left for
alcohol or drugs.</TE>
<TE>   After two years of this, his stepfather -- just 14 years his
senior -- asked him what he planned to do with the rest of his life.
That got him thinking.</TE>
<TE>   Carey so appreciated all the charitable Americans he'd met during
his travels, and the ease with which he'd found work, that he decided
to repay his country through the military. His stepfather urged him
to become an officer. Why, Carey asked. "Because when the enlisted
guys are drinking beer, the officers are drinking Scotch," his
stepdad replied.</TE>
<TE>   So Carey opted for college and Air Force ROTC.</TE>
<TE>   He'd forgotten so much during his time off that he had to hit the
books and relearn high school algebra and trigonometry. But it paid
off: He won a scholarship at the University of Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   Carey got his engineering degree in 3 1/2 years and went on for a
master's in the early 1980s. By then, he had married his motorcycling
sweetheart, Cheryl, and space shuttles had begun to fly.</TE>
<TE>   After Air Force stints in Korea, Spain and the Persian Gulf and
experience with A-10s and F-16s, Carey was accepted into test pilot
school in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   With an eye to becoming an astronaut, as unattainable as that
seemed, Carey applied to NASA in 1994. Not even a nibble. He tried
again the next year, at his wife's urging. This time, he was invited
for an interview and impressed the selection board with his
hard-knocks background. "I don't know why they hired me, quite
frankly," he said with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good to have a mix of different kinds of people," explained
Ross. "If everybody in the astronaut office looked exactly the same,
it would be boring and you wouldn't get near as much done probably."</TE>
<TE>   For most astronauts, flying in space is as good as it gets. And
although Carey says that nothing professionally has been as
satisfying as making the Hubble Telescope better, motorcycle riding
still beats space travel for him.</TE>
<TE>   Carey took into orbit an American Motorcyclist Assn. flag, which
he delivered -- by motorcycle -- to the group's Ohio headquarters in
May. It is on display along with his old association membership card,
which also accompanied him to space.</TE>
<TE>   The association, in turn, presented Carey with its brighter image
award for putting motorcycling in a positive light.</TE>
<TE>   "Duane Carey is -- the cliche would be role model, but not only
for motorcyclists but for just about anyone," said Tom Lindsay,
association spokesman. "Like there's no typical motorcyclist, there's
probably no typical astronaut. But his is certainly an unusual
story."</TE>
<TE>   Carey's astronaut pals accept his passion for bikes and motocross,
even those who find the sport dangerous. (Apollo 12 commander Pete
Conrad survived two lightning strikes on his way to the moon in 1969,
only to die after wiping out on his bike 30 years later. Carey, for
the record, has broken ribs and had other minor injuries in
motorcycle spills.)</TE>
<TE>   But cycles are a passion so deep that he turned down an
appointment to the Air Force Academy in the late 1970s because cadets
couldn't have vehicles their first two years. Now, 18-year-old son
Zachary, not nearly as zealous about the sport as his father, is in
his first year there.</TE>
<TE>   "Motorcycles have ruined my life in a sense," said Carey, who
rides a Honda ST1100 and Yamaha YZ250. His wife has her own bike, a
Suzuki Savage.</TE>
<TE>   The Careys hop on his motorcycle every Sunday morning in Houston
and ride a couple hundred miles to get breakfast, "just so we don't
forget how to do that." During a family vacation to St. Paul over the
summer, his wife drove the car -- and Carey rode his bike.</TE>
<TE>   Now a lieutenant colonel, the astronaut is counting down the years
and months to November 2004 when he can retire from NASA and the
military.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm stopping in the middle of really what for most people are the
most productive years of their career, and I'm going to stop because
I can't bear to go any more time in my life without going back on the
road full-time," he said. "I thought I would get that out of my
system, but now it's stuck. Our clocks are ticking.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a lot of money," he added, "but we have enough to
have the kind of lifestyle that we dream about later. And it's going
to involve jumping back on the bikes and traveling."</TE>

<HD>Study Seeks Ways to Retard Hearing Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Q. Haney</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BEAVER DAM, Wis. -- Naturally, the last thing older folks in Beaver
Dam want to hear is that they are going deaf. So 3,753 of them have
agreed to regular testing and probing to help people everywhere learn
some simple and unexpected things that may ward it off.</LD>
<LD>   Gradual hearing impairment -- long shrugged off as just another
inescapable indignity of aging -- is at last getting some serious
study, and the results from Beaver Dam suggest that something can be
done about it: having a drink, perhaps, or even just going for a
walk.</LD>
<LD>   Elderly hearing loss has a fancy name, presbycusis, but
surprisingly little is known about what underlies it. Changing this
is the goal of the Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study, the country's
largest project devoted solely to the sources of this seemingly
universal health problem.</LD>
<TE>   "People need to know that hearing loss might not be an inevitable
part of growing older," said Karen Cruickshanks of the University of
Wisconsin, the study's director.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1993, her team has measured the hearing and health of
two-thirds of people over age 48 in Beaver Dam, population 15,000, a
manufacturing city in the rolling dairy lands about 60 miles
northwest of Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   "This settles one thing," said John Landdeck, 61, president of the
community hospital and a study volunteer. "Everybody in town knows
when they can't hear their wife whether it's their hearing or her
mumbling."</TE>
<TE>   That, actually, is one of the study's more interesting findings.
It shows men have poorer hearing than women, even when a lifetime of
noisy jobs and hobbies like chain sawing and snowmobiling are figured
in. And as people get past retirement age, their hearing tends to get
worse. Over age 80, about 90% of the population has trouble.</TE>
<TE>   If Beaver Dam is typical -- and the researchers believe it is --
then hearing loss is considerably more common than experts would have
guessed. The usual national estimate is that one-third of older
Americans have some problem. This study puts the figure at nearly
half.</TE>
<TE>   But even if more whadya-say moments are hard to avoid,
Cruickshanks hopes her study will find ways to delay the problem or
keep it as mild as possible. Although the hazards of incessant loud
noise are well-known, this study is beginning to show the effects of
other less obvious health and living habits, including some people
can change.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very complicated subject," said Dr. James Battey, director
of the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication
Disorders. "A lot goes into it, and we are only beginning to sort it
out."</TE>
<TE>   Such as drinking, for example. Beaver Dam people who have a drink
or two a day are about 40% less likely than nondrinkers to have
hearing loss, although heavy drinking is bad for hearing, just as it
is for other partsof the body. Exercise also seems to prevent or
delay elderly hearing loss.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, smoking seems to be bad for the hearing. In
Beaver Dam, smokers are about 70% more likely than nonsmokers to have
some loss.</TE>
<TE>   All of this raises the possibility that what's good for the heart
-- or bad for it -- may have similar effects on hearing. Clogged
arteries are the underlying cause of heart attacks, and the
researchers suspect that decreasing blood flow to the inner ear
increases the risk of going deaf.</TE>
<TE>   They found that heart attack survivors are almost twice as likely
to have poorly working cochleas, the spiral-shaped organs in the ears
that convert vibrations into nerve impulses. And those whose hearing
worsened during the study tended to have more thickening of the
carotid artery.</TE>
<TE>   If preventing heart disease also saves hearing, it might offer
another reason to take cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins. So
researchers are watching the Beaver Dam residents who use the pills.</TE>
<TE>   Still, none of this proves a real link between bad hearts and bad
ears. Researchers outside the Beaver Dam project are divided on the
subject.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there absolutely is something there," said Sandra
Gordon-Salant, a University of Maryland hearing researcher. "Is it
the cardiovascular disease that causes hearing loss? Is it the
medications people take? That needs to be teased out."</TE>
<TE>   But Dr. George Gates, director of the Bloedel Hearing Research
Center at the University of Washington, is skeptical. He analyzes
data from the landmark Framingham Heart Study, the only other major
U.S. project to measure hearing over time, and sees no strong link
between hearing and hearts. Even if people with poor hearing really
do have more heart disease, he says, it may simply be because people
who hurt their hearing with noisy jobs are also likely to eat red
meat and smoke.</TE>
<TE>   While that debate plays out, the older folks of Beaver Dam cannot
help being more aware of their hearing and what harms it.</TE>
<TE>   Retired nurse Helen Glewen, 61, says that since joining the study,
she has persuaded her husband to wear earplugs when he hunts. And she
has changed her seat at the County Fair's country music shows. "I
used to take a lawn chair and sit as close as I could," she said.
"Now I sit way up in the bleachers."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly noise is the most obvious cause of bad hearing. Like
other research, the Beaver Dam project documents the damage of
frequent exposure, especially to anything above 85 to 90 decibels,
such as the din once common in factories and foundries. People tend
to have worse hearing later in life if they drove tractors without
cabs, served in tanks in World War II or had any job where they
needed to shout to be heard.</TE>
<TE>   Hobbies may also contribute to deafness, especially if they
involve guns. For instance, Beaver Dam target shooters are 50% more
likely to have poor hearing; each five years of hunting results in a
7% hike in the likelihood of high-frequency hearing loss.</TE>
<TE>   Among other loud hobbies, the worst seems to be woodworking. Men
who putter in their shops have a 30% increase in hearing loss,
probably because the saws are loud and they spend a lot of time at
their task.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers also asked about exposure to blenders, hair
dryers, food processors and vacuum cleaners, although none caused any
measurable harm.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Glewen's worry about country music, researchers conclude
that concert-going is not much of a factor. However, some wonder what
music is doing to younger people who are more interested in heavy
metal than Hank Williams. For now, though, the research suggests that
deafness will be less a problem for future generations.</TE>
<TE>   Cruickshanks notes the youngest people in the study -- those in
their late 40s and early 50s when they enrolled -- seem to lose their
hearing less quickly than their elders, possibly because they have
less ear-splitting jobs. "Certainly, there has been a big shift away
from blue-collar jobs and a lot of improvements with noise reduction
at work," she noted.</TE>
<TE>   But will too much head-banging rock cancel out the benefit of all
that hushed desk work? Battey, for one, doubts it, unless the
listener goes every night and sits in front of the speakers.</TE>
<TE>   And headphones? Probably not either. "They may be annoying for
other reasons, but not necessarily because they will compromise
hearing, although I know there are parents all over the country who
would like me to say that," he said.</TE>

<HD>Students Worm Out of Dissection</HD>
<DH>Some schools offer computer simulations, but a teachers
group says there is no substitute for the real thing. Eight states
allow opting out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Crary</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Increasing numbers of students are asking to opt out of the science
class ritual of dissecting frogs or fetal pigs, branding the practice
cruel and insisting that they can learn as much from computer
simulations.</LD>
<LD>   A 16-year-old honor student was removed from her Baltimore anatomy
class recently after refusing to dissect a cat, then allowed back in
-- with the option of computer alternatives -- after protesters
picketed the school.</LD>
<LD>   In Las Vegas, the Clark County school board voted this year to let
students opt out of dissections if they have parental support. The
policy was adopted after a petition drive by eighth-grader Laurie
Wolff, an A student who received a C in science two years earlier
after declining to cut up an earthworm.</LD>
<TE>   Anti-dissection students also appealed for policy changes this
year at a school board meeting in Little Chute, Wis., and last year
before a state Senate committee in Vermont.</TE>
<TE>   Little Chute student Amy Richards gave a practical reason for
accommodating the dissenters. "They won't learn much with their eyes
closed because they're disgusted," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A student delegation from Woodstock Union High School in Vermont
helped get a bill introduced to allow students to use computer
models. The bill died in the Senate Education Committee.</TE>
<TE>   National teachers' groups maintain that dissections are a better
learning tool than simulations, but suggest instructors be sensitive
to student qualms.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Humane Society of the United States, eight states
have approved opt-out policies -- California, Florida, Illinois,
Louisiana, Maine, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. A similar
policy is pending in New Jersey's legislature.</TE>
<TE>   The Baltimore case illustrates how quickly a teacher's decision
can become the focus of ideological controversy.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 23, Jennifer Watson was taken out of her Kenwood High
honors anatomy class and placed in a general science class after she
asked for an alternative to cat dissection. The next evening, Humane
Society officials attended a school board meeting, asking that
dissection alternatives be provided districtwide.</TE>
<TE>   The following day, about 20 protesters picketed outside Kenwood
High, and school officials announced that Jennifer would be allowed
back in her class. She will perform computer-simulated dissections,
while the rest of the class dissects cats.</TE>
<TE>   "I've loved animals my whole life," said Jennifer, whose family
has several cats. "I was standing up for what I believe in."</TE>
<TE>   The Humane Society estimates that 6 million animals -- mostly
frogs, fetal pigs and cats -- are dissected annually in American
schools. The society distributes anti-dissection videos and lends
computer software to schools interested in offering alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   Lesley King, the Humane Society's director for education and
animal welfare, said school districts can save money by purchasing
reusable dissection software rather than dead animals that can only
be dissected once.</TE>
<TE>   The 9,000-member National Assn. of Biology Teachers is wary of the
push for alternatives. Although it urges teachers to be sensitive to
students' objections, its formal position says: "No alternative can
substitute for the actual experience of dissection."</TE>
<TE>   "This is an issue of academic freedom," said Wayne Carley,
association executive director. "A well-trained teacher has the
knowledge and experience to know how best to use dissection."</TE>
<TE>   The National Science Teachers Assn., which claims 53,000 members,
also defends dissection but advises teachers to be flexible.</TE>
<TE>   "There were few suitable alternatives when I taught, but now there
are some extremely sophisticated virtual technologies," said Wendell
Mohling, a former biology teacher in Shawnee Mission, Kan., who is
associate executive director of the science teachers' group.</TE>

<HD>Mystery Surrounds Soldier's Disappearance in Guantanamo</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE, Cuba -- Army Staff Sgt. Ryan Foraker was
charged with transporting and guarding hundreds of suspected
terrorists at this outpost, but he wasn't without his phobias.</LD>
<LD>   He was scared of heights and the ocean, but since he vanished more
than two weeks ago, the most plausible explanation for his
disappearance has been that he climbed down a cliff and drowned.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not buying that," said his mother, Ann Foraker, 58, speaking
by telephone last week from the home of her son and daughter-in-law
in Logan, Ohio.</LD>
<TE>   Foraker's wallet, military ID, and civilian shorts and T-shirt
were found folded and stuck in a crevasse outside the Camp America
barracks, just yards from Camp Delta, where 598 detainees accused of
links to the Taliban or Al Qaeda are being held. Nearby, 20-foot
cliffs overlook the Caribbean Sea.</TE>
<TE>   "He wouldn't have left his ID," his mother said. "He worked too
hard to become sergeant and knew leaving the ID could cost him his
stripes."</TE>
<TE>   Foraker, 31, was last seen about 1:30 a.m. on Sept. 24 -- his day
off -- when he picked up a flashlight from his quarters and vanished
into the night.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything we have learned about him, there is not a single shred
of evidence to support any kind of wrongdoing," said Col. John
Perrone, who is in charge of Camp Delta.</TE>
<TE>   He described Foraker as a model soldier. "He had an excellent work
record. He had a good work ethic. He wasn't aloof about his position.
He took it very seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Foraker was supposed to call his family the day he disappeared
because one of his daughters was sick. Foraker's wife, Angela, said
everything seemed normal when she spoke with him the day before he
vanished.</TE>
<TE>   "He would call every other day," Ann Foraker said. "He was happy.
He lived for those girls, and there's no way he would have missed
calling."</TE>
<TE>   Foraker deployed to Guantanamo in February and had spent several
months transporting detainees from Turkey to Cuba, his mother said.
It was unclear whether he spent any time in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a true-blue soldier," his mother said. "There were certain
things he said he just couldn't tell us."</TE>
<TE>   His family says he was terrified of heights and would never go
swimming alone. "He was always incredibly cautious -- so much so that
it used to irritate his brothers," his mother said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the ocean was calm the day he vanished.</TE>
<TE>   Foraker is the first soldier to disappear since the detention
mission began in January on Cuba's eastern tip, and one of the only
people -- military or civilian -- to disappear from the base in
recent memory.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities suspended the search Oct. 4 but said they would keep
looking during routine sweeps. Cuban officials were also informed.</TE>
<TE>   Foraker's family said they've grown frustrated with the lack of
information from the U.S. military, which so far has prevented
Foraker's wife from going to Guantanamo.</TE>
<TE>   "They told me I couldn't because of security concerns," said
Angela Foraker, 24. "In the beginning, I supported the military. But
my whole outlook has changed."</TE>
<TE>   Foraker, a Gulf War veteran with the 342nd Military Police Company
of Ohio, was one of about 1,000 guards at Camp Delta, where he worked
9- and sometimes 10-hour shifts watching the detainees.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel our son is every bit as important as Sept. 11," said his
mother, whose three sons served in the military. "I've given the
military all three of my sons, and this is all they can do for me?"</TE>
<TE>   Missing posters dot the base's sparse facilities.</TE>
<TE>   With four years as a full-time soldier in the Army, then nine
years since as a reservist, Foraker was devoted to the military, his
wife said. He even considered becoming a recruiter and giving up his
job laying gas pipelines at Miller Pipeline Corp. outside Columbus.</TE>
<TE>   Foraker last came home for Father's Day, and his unit was to
return home in November.</TE>
<TE>   The Forakers' fifth wedding anniversary is Nov. 19. They have two
daughters, 3 and 14 months.</TE>
<TE>   Angela Foraker still doesn't know what to tell her 3-year-old, who
is making plans for the next time she sees her father.</TE>
<TE>   "It's rough," she said. "What do I tell my daughters when I don't

<HD>Oh Say Can You See Purchasing the Estate of Francis Scott
Key?</HD>
<DH>Author of 'The Star- Spangled Banner' lived much of his
life at the Maryland farm, which is down to 149 acres. Its price:
$1.3 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>KEYMAR, Md. -- Even by the dawn's early light, it's hard to miss the
birthplace of Francis Scott Key. The cream-colored brick house has a
U.S. flag flying several stories above the farm fields of
northwestern Carroll County.</LD>
<LD>   Terra Rubra -- Latin for "red earth" -- is the 149-acre farm along
Pipe Creek where the author of "The Star-Spangled Banner" played,
learned patriotism and in later years entertained his grandchildren.</LD>
<LD>   And it's for sale.</LD>
<TE>   The Terra Rubra Home Trust, which owns the farm, put it on the
market Aug. 15. The asking price: $1.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   "I really can't remember when a house of this significance has
come on the market in Maryland," said Charen Rubin, the property's
real estate broker.</TE>
<TE>   Trustee Terri Baker, who has lived in the four-bedroom, two-story
house for 29 years, said the estate -- including a huge barn and
several outbuildings -- has become too big for her and her
16-year-old daughter, Tenni.</TE>
<TE>   "I want something that's kind of downsizing and empty nest," Baker
said.</TE>
<TE>   Selling also makes sense financially. Demand for residential real
estate has risen sharply since her father bought Terra Rubra for
about $250,000 in 1974.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good market," said Baker, a biologist at the National
Cancer Institute.</TE>
<TE>   She'll leave behind memories of the goats, sheep, cattle and
horses she raised there, as well as plank floors and hand-forged
hardware that date to at least 1865, when the house was rebuilt after
an 1858 windstorm. The cellar and chimneys date to 1770, when Key's
grandfather, Philip Key, settled in the hilly area 40 miles northwest
of Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   The new owner will have to contend with tourists who drop in
unexpectedly about once a month after spotting the estate on state
road maps. Most realize that it's not a museum as they come up the
driveway but some ask for tours.</TE>
<TE>   "It's never really been a burden over the years," Baker said.</TE>
<TE>   The buildings and grounds appear well-kept, although not always
with an eye toward historic preservation. One bedroom is decorated
with stars and space shuttles wallpaper. The kitchen is thoroughly
modern, and the carriage house contains a hot tub, water bed and bar.</TE>
<TE>   The dining room decor better reflects the home's history. An oil
portrait of Key hangs on one wall, opposite a framed reprint of the
poem he wrote after witnessing the British shelling of Ft. McHenry in
Baltimore Harbor the night of Sept. 13, 1814. The poem, with music
borrowed from an English pub song, "To Anacreon in Heaven," was
declared the national anthem in 1931.</TE>
<TE>   Key was born at Terra Rubra, then a 3,000-acre plantation, on Aug.
1, 1780. His father, John Ross Key, a circuit judge, told the boy
thrilling stories of his service in the revolutionary army, according
to a 1937 biography, "Francis Scott Key: Life and Times," by Edward
S. Delaplaine.</TE>
<TE>   At age 10, Key was sent to grammar school at St. John's College in
Annapolis, where he lived with relatives. He also received his
bachelor's and law degrees there, returning to Terra Rubra in the
summers.</TE>
<TE>   He practiced law in nearby Frederick and later Washington, but
treasured his visits to Terra Rubra, which he inherited and willed to
his wife, Polly. Delaplaine quotes an unidentified granddaughter's
recollection of Key riding on horseback beside his grandchildren
during wagon rides around the farm.</TE>
<TE>   The family kept slaves. Baker and Rubin identified one bedroom as
former slave sleeping quarters, and a slave graveyard is marked on
the property. Key, who is buried at Mount Olivet cemetery in
Frederick, condemned the buying and selling of slaves for profit but
also opposed freeing slaves unconditionally, favoring instead the
concept of sending liberated slaves to Africa, according to
biographers.</TE>
<TE>   Terra Rubra eventually passed out of Key family ownership, and the
estate's acreage dwindled as portions were sold off to pay debts.
Rubin said the property, which is on the National Register of
Historic Places, may be especially appealing as a horse farm.</TE>
<TE>   Although some of the farmland is protected by agricultural
easements, the estate could be carved up into eight lots under local
zoning laws.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago-based writer Sam Meyer, author of a 1995 Key biography,
"Paradoxes of Fame: The Francis Scott Key Story," said he hopes that
the property remains intact.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it would be nice if it were preserved," he said. "It
would be a very fitting monument."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FAYETTEVILLE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>A Ft. Bragg soldier trying to stage his own disappearance searched
the Internet for a man who looked like him and cut the man's throat,
but the victim survived, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The victim pulled the 8-inch knife from his throat, cut ropes
around his hands and feet, and fled, sheriff's Det. Barbara Davenport
said.</LD>
<LD>   Jonathan Meadows, a specialist assigned to the 37th Engineering
Battalion, was charged with attempted murder and held in lieu of
$50,000 bond.</LD>
<TE>   Meadows spent weeks searching the Internet for someone who would
be mistaken for himself, Davenport said. He was seeking men who were
5-foot-6, about 150 pounds, with brown hair and blue eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Meadows found Stephen "Jeremy" Bowen about two weeks ago, lured
him to his home, tied him up and cut his throat the night of Oct. 6,
Davenport said. Bowen, 26, who suffered severe cuts to his larynx,
ran to a neighbor's house. Meadows surrendered shortly after the
attack.</TE>
<TE>   Meadows, 20, said his plot was a way to get out of the Army,
according to investigators. He was frustrated with the Army and
depressed, Davenport said.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't want the Army looking for him," she said. "He didn't
want his wife looking for him. He said he was going to assume a new
identity. I think he thought it was set up so well that nobody would
think it [the body] wasn't him."</TE>
<TE>   Meadows and Bowen first met about a week ago at a bookstore in
Fayetteville for coffee. They met a second time Oct. 6 at Meadows'
home, Davenport said.</TE>
<TE>   Meadows' attorney, Cynthia Black, declined to comment. His next
court appearance is scheduled for Oct. 24.</TE>
<TE>   Meadows and his wife, Thea, separated last month, and she moved to
Tennessee with their two girls, ages 3 years and 7 months,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Meadows joined the Army in 1999.</TE>

<HD>Lawmakers Accuse Bush of 9/11 Deceit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helen Dewar</AU>
<BD>The Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Angry lawmakers accused the White House Friday of
secretly trying to derail creation of an independent commission to
investigate the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks while professing to
support the idea. The White House responded by renewing its pledge of
support for the proposal and suggesting an agreement was near.</LD>
<LD>   A day after the collapse of an announced deal to create the
commission, there was little agreement on anything, including causes
of the disagreement. The White House said the remaining disputes
involve how many votes from commission members would be required to
issue subpoenas and who would appoint the chairman. Lawmakers said
the real issue is whether the White House wants a commission.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal would create a 10-member panel of private citizens to
consider a broad array of concerns about the nation's readiness to
deal with terrorism, including aviation, border security and
immigration as well as intelligence capabilities currently under
investigation by the House and Senate intelligence committees. Its
membership would be equally divided between appointees of Republican
and Democratic officials.</LD>
<TE>   Negotiators plan to meet again this week, but it was unclear
whether the dispute would be resolved in time for final action this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Sens. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) and House
Democratic Whip Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco held a news conference
to blame what Pelosi called the "invisible hand" of the White House
for torpedoing an all but final accord on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "The White House is professing openly to support an independent
commission [while] privately they're moving to thwart the
commission," Pelosi said.</TE>
<TE>   McCain said senior members of the House and Senate intelligence
committees had a written agreement approving the proposal for
inclusion in the intelligence authorization bill for this year. But
then the House Republican leadership weighed in against it and the
deal collapsed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   It's no secret that "the White House works through the House
Republican leadership," McCain said.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you really want to allow this commission to be created?"
Lieberman asked the White House. "And if you don't, why not?"</TE>
<TE>   They were joined by Stephen Push, spokesman for a group
representing about 1,300 survivors of Sept. 11 attack victims. He
said he did not believe the White House wants a commission because it
fears what it might find.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Ari Fleischer denied that President Bush is
trying to sabotage the proposal. "We are very close to getting an
agreement on the 9/11 commission, and the president thinks it can and
should be done," Fleischer said. He cited two points of disagreement
-- subpoenas and the chairmanship -- but said Bush "would be very
disappointed if the Congress allowed these issues to keep the
agreement from happening."</TE>
<TE>   While lawmakers proposed to allow subpoenas to be issued by five
commission members, Bush wants a larger number to assure bipartisan
backing, Fleischer said. "One-party subpoenas are a formula for
paralysis," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Fleischer said, with nine of the 10 commission members to be
appointed by congressional leaders, Bush wants to be able to appoint
the chairman. The lawmakers had proposed presidential appointment of
a co-chairman.</TE>
<TE>   McCain described the administration's objections as involving
"minutia."</TE>
<TE>   In another complication, Rep. Porter J. Goss (R-Fla.), chairman of
the House intelligence committee, denied he had signed off on the
agreement. He said more details need to be worked out, including
issues involving committee jurisdiction and whether the commission
should investigate Congress as well as executive-branch agencies. "I
want to see an independent commission," Goss said.</TE>
<TE>   Even if details can't be worked out this year, McCain and
Lieberman vowed to continue pushing for the commission next year.
"It's going to happen," McCain said.</TE>

<HD>Family Ties Shake but Don't Break as Teen Comes Out</HD>
<DH>Daughter's lesbianism changes the Cuban refugee home
forever. Parents must adjust their hopes and expectations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martha Irvine</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MIAMI -- She came to this country in the arms of her parents, Cuban
refugees who braved the treacherous Straits of Florida to find
freedom and a new life.</LD>
<LD>   Maria Ortiz would grow to become, by some definitions, an
all-American girl -- a petite, pretty cheerleader and good student
who ran with the popular crowd. She was exactly the sort of daughter
her parents had imagined -- until she turned 14.</LD>
<LD>   Increasingly secretive and aloof, Maria began to withdraw from her
family and friends. Concerned, her father, Heriberto, decided to ask
what was wrong -- and got the answer he feared. "I think I like
girls, Daddy," she told him at a fast-food restaurant.</LD>
<TE>   It was a moment that changes a family forever, when parents'
dreams for a child are altered and expectations shift.</TE>
<TE>   When that life-changing moment involves a child revealing that he
or she is gay, the parental bond sometimes breaks. Studies have found
that as many as half of lesbians and gay men are rejected by their
parents. Other times, as painful as the adjustment can be, the
parent-child bond eventually strengthens.</TE>
<TE>   That has been the case for Heriberto and Mayda Ortiz and Maria,
the second of their three daughters. They are close now -- but only
after Heriberto and Mayda spent years soul-searching and
second-guessing themselves as parents. Even 10 years after she came
out, they sometimes struggle with the idea that Maria won't be
marrying a man and having children.</TE>
<TE>   "It is like a death of a daughter," Heriberto said. "All your
expectations die and you have to learn something new."</TE>
<TE>   When Maria made her revelation, Heriberto didn't shout or stomp
his feet. If anything, she remembers him looking as though he was on
the verge of tears.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, he says, he was. Though a psychologist for many years, he
felt ill-prepared to deal with anything like this. He worried that
someone had filled Maria's head with ideas that weren't really hers.
He also wondered if he'd done something that influenced her sexual
orientation.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how we will get through this," he remembered telling
Maria. "But we will."</TE>
<TE>   In the early days, Maria's parents attempted to monitor her every
move. They screened her phone calls and listened in on conversations.
They took away her music and tore down posters. They also refused to
leave her home alone. "It was like surveillance," said Maria, now 24
and in college. "It was like I was under house arrest."</TE>
<TE>   Her parents say they were simply doing what they thought best. "I
just never thought I'd have to face that," said Mayda, a junior high
school teacher. "I had to process it. It was a process."</TE>
<TE>   Maria only rebelled more, skipping class and getting poor grades
for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, she cut and slicked back her hair and dressed in
men's clothing. She also went through a Goth phase, when she wore
dark clothing and painted her room black and dark gray. "I did it
because I was sad," she said. "I isolated myself more and more."</TE>
<TE>   Early on, she considered suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Then, the summer before her sophomore year, she arrived home to
find a school uniform on the couch. "Who's that for?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   When her parents told her they had enrolled her in Catholic
school, she ran to her bedroom and hid in the closet. It was a
last-ditch effort, her parents say, to find the daughter they thought
they knew.</TE>
<TE>   Maria believed that they were asking for the impossible. "How do
you change your identity, something so deeply rooted?" she asked.
"You can't."</TE>
<TE>   To this day, she occasionally wavers between anger and love for
the parents she calls "wonderful, wonderful people."</TE>
<TE>   "I think they just thought it was something terrible," she said.
"They wondered who was going to take care of me. They saw being gay
as a really hard life to live. They didn't want that for their
child." She paused and frowned. "Maybe they felt betrayed too."</TE>
<TE>   Maria attended the Catholic high school for two years. Eventually,
she persuaded her parents to let her attend public school for her
senior year. After graduation, she moved into a townhouse with a
friend. "I needed to leave the house, their rules," Maria said.</TE>
<TE>   After years flip-flopping between therapists, she found one who
told her something that surprised her: "There's nothing wrong with
you -- you're OK." "It was the first time an adult had ever said that
to me," Maria said.</TE>
<TE>   She longed for the same support from her parents. But healing and
understanding would come in fits and starts.</TE>
<TE>   Although still uncomfortable, Heriberto and Mayda continued to
include Maria in family gatherings and stopped shutting out talk
about her dating.</TE>
<TE>   But Maria lashed out. "No matter what they did, I resented it,"
she said. "I'm sure there are points when I said I hated them."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't true, she says now. And in time, she began to forgive --
especially when her parents began inviting then-girlfriend Jan to
family dinners and celebrations.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Maria reports how her mother chides those who make
homophobic comments -- and how her father asked her advice when
planning to talk about gay issues on a local radio show he hosts.</TE>
<TE>   What's important, says her mother, is that Maria find the "right
person." "If she's happy, I'm happy," Mayda said.</TE>
<TE>   Heriberto admits his feelings are bittersweet, but he emphasizes
one thing: He never considered throwing Maria out. In fact, her
parents never wanted her to leave home.</TE>
<TE>   Maria moved back home this summer, after she and Jan broke up. "I
needed to be somewhere that felt like home," she said. She plans to
stay while she finishes her bachelor's degree. She hopes to go to law
school and become a civil rights attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Six years after she left, Maria says home life is amazingly good.
Her parents know the feeling.</TE>
<TE>   "Life is a surprise," her mother said. "It's like a movie -- you
don't know how it's going to end."</TE>

<LD>Two more good books about Winston Churchill, and no doubt there are
many more to come. The man himself was extraordinary, and no other
statesman of the 20th century performed in so many of its dramas. Sir
Martin Gilbert, a veritable Hercules of our profession, has been at
it since 1968 and, after 23 volumes of biography and documents, he
still hasn't finished. Less monumental biographies are available in
all sizes. Last year's crop was Roy Jenkins' 1,000 pages and my own
370: in British terms, "long" and "medium-size" respectively. To my
surprise, the Claremont Review described mine as "short." How, then,
will these much shorter works by John Lukacs and John Keegan be
assessed?</LD>
<LD>   In "Churchill: Visionary, Statesman, Historian," Lukacs offers the
reflections of a wise, experienced, philosophically minded historian,
long fascinated by Churchill and never tired of contemplating his
place in history. His is a book to make readers wish to read a
biography, while Keegan's brief biography may make readers wish to
read a longer one. Keegan manages to incorporate almost everything
that really mattered in Churchill's life into a very readable
narrative soundly founded on the history his hero moved through and,
to some extent, made.</LD>
<TE>   Each acknowledges, as all other Churchill-watchers have done, that
the man is ultimately unclassifiable, un-sum-up-able. Seeking in
their different ways the heart of the Churchillian mystery, they
converge on two fundamentals: his roots in History, and his love of
Liberty.</TE>
<TE>   Not only did Churchill know a lot of history, write history and
make history, he was possessed by a conviction that the history of
Britain displayed the development of good principles of government --
accountability, freedom of the press, rule of law and so on -- which
had been spread around much of the world through the British Empire
and Commonwealth and its amazing byproduct, the United States; both
of them, empire and America alike, great political institutions
working for good in the world. This was the source of his belief in
the "special relationship" and the cause of his confidence, in the
desperate dark days of 1940, that the United States would wake up to
the fact that Hitler's Germany was antithetical not only to the
values of Britain and its empire but to the values of America as
well.</TE>
<TE>   With America's entry into the war in 1941, his confidence appeared
to have been justified. But he never understood how differently the
special relationship was valued on the other side. He was mortified
to discover that America's war aims and postwar policy included the
dissolution of the British Empire. This, he felt sure, was not for
the greater good of humankind. Looking at what has happened since
then in some of the lands of its precipitate deconstruction, perhaps
we might agree. The other fundamental these authors join to pinpoint
was Churchill's human "decency": the quality dear above all else to
Churchill's contemporary, George Orwell. Given his egotism and
willfulness, Churchill possessed an essential decency that was not
always easy to see. But it was deep and constant, for all that it was
set in an old-fashioned paternalist mold. Having had a rotten
childhood himself, he made sure his children had a good one. He was a
loving and faithful husband, albeit a sometimes maddening one. Keegan
strikingly defines him as a "libertarian." He was one of the founders
of the British welfare state, he stood up for workers' rights against
their employers (but not against the state!), he readily sympathized
with underdogs, he was passionate about the liberties of the subject
and the protections provided by the rule of law, and in World War II
his determination to save the liberties of the British was matched by
an equal determination to retrieve the liberties of the peoples of
Western Europe "now gripped and tormented in a base and cruel
servitude."</TE>
<TE>   Although fascinated by war (and, thank God, good at conducting
it), Churchill was aware of his addiction and devoted most of his
years as an international statesman to peacemaking. He liked winning,
whether it was in argument or battle, but, once he had won, his
inclination was to be generous and charitable. Lukacs rightly makes
much of this, reminding us that the moral and motto of his six-volume
memoir-history, "The Second World War," was: "In War, Resolution; in
Defeat, Defiance; in Victory, Magnanimity; in Peace, Goodwill."</TE>
<TE>   Each book gains force from its author's particular emphases and
insights. Keegan, for instance, reminds us of Churchill's many
accidents and ailments, numerous enough to make his wartime exertions
and travels (40,000 miles) all the more astonishing. He advances a
disputable point of view in his two pages about the relative
uselessness of the resistance movements in occupied Europe but gives
a fine and fair picture both of Churchill's obsession with operations
in and northward from the Mediterranean and of his reluctance to back
the Normandy invasion, a reluctance understandably irritating to his
American allies. In a moving conclusion, Keegan pays just tribute to
Churchill's splendid wife, "Clemmie" (as he always called
Clementine), and confronts the curious phenomenon that "those who
remember him most fervently seem more numerous in North America than
in the United Kingdom." This, he suggests, is because "Churchill's
memory has been subsumed within something larger, the popular memory
of the Second World War, which has been transformed into a national
saga." Alas, that saga does not grip all of us. Such have been the
accompanying deformations in British society since the 1960s that,
during an anarchic "green" demonstration in London last summer,
Churchill's statue in Parliament Square was smeared with green paint
and topped with a punk hairdo.</TE>
<TE>   About half of Lukacs' book is given to contemplation of
Churchill's statesmanship from the "visionary" early 1930s, when he
sounded the tocsin about Hitler, through to the early 1950s, when he
sought to explore the possibility of what we came to call detente.
Lukacs very reasonably argues that Churchill's perceptions of Joseph
Stalin were more sensible than FDR's, that his perceptions of the
Soviet Union after the death of Stalin were more sensible than those
of President Eisenhower and John Foster Dulles, and that the way his
special relations snubbed him was regrettable. (Churchill loathed
Dulles.) Lukacs' admiration for Churchill's "historianship" produces
some enjoyable ripostes to Churchill's critics, even the loftiest of
them.</TE>
<TE>   But Lukacs' concluding chapter is the most arresting one: It is
the account he wrote at the time of his three-day visit to London for
Churchill's funeral in January 1965. He fears it tends to the
sentimental, but I would rather call it emotional -- not at all
surprising in an admirer of Britain, proud of his European heritage
and, like all the others assembling in London, a grateful beneficiary
of Churchill's role on the world-historical stage. He observes all
those others with an equal eye: the royals, the cockneys, the prime
ministers and presidents (but where was President Johnson?), the
"thinning and threadbare and sorely tried middle class," the Polish
veterans and the French resisters, the middle-age airmen who, slimmer
and younger, had won the Battle of Britain, the Churchill family
"walking with beauty and dignity behind the coffin ... no signs of
the ravages of life, only the tragic quiet of discipline on Sarah
Churchill's pale jeweled face...."</TE>
<TE>   It is a remarkable evocation of the event, made more impressive by
Lukacs' solemn reflections on its meaning for Britain. The end of an
era, indeed ... with the green-paint people already gathering behind
the scenes.</TE>

<HD>America in black and white</HD>
<DH>Time of Change: Civil Rights Photographs, 1961-1965, by
Bruce Davidson, Saint Ann's Press: 160 pp., $65</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Julian Bond</AU>
<BD>Julian Bond is a distinguished professor at American
University and a professor of history at the University of Virginia.
He is chairman of the NAACP board of directors.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bruce Davidson's "Time of Change: Civil Rights Photographs,
1961-1965" isn't strictly a book of civil rights pictures, but all of
the pictures -- mostly of blacks in Harlem, Chicago, Washington and
the American South -- are about the civil rights movement, the early
'60s African American awakening expressed most publicly in Southern
protest and more quietly elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   Early on, we see a group of satisfied and smiling Harlem matrons
in hats at a luncheon banquet opposite a picture of a mother in a hat
with a child and gloves in hand before an NAACP information desk.
Later, black men in dark suits and women in furs laugh at jokes we do
not hear and look at scenes we cannot see.</LD>
<LD>   Those merry matrons, sitting before shining silverware and neatly
folded white napkins, those men and women so finely dressed, express
the movement's goals -- identity and pride in self -- as surely as
the woman with a "Jim Crow must go" picket sign a page away.</LD>
<TE>   Davidson, a member of Magnum Photos when many of these pictures
were taken, had also been a Life photographer, but most of these
images result from a 1962 Guggenheim Fellowship. They were rewarded
with a 1966 National Endowment for the Arts grant, the first of its
kind offered for photography by the NEA. "Time of Change" joins other
collections of photographs of the civil rights movement by Danny
Lyon, Herbert Randall and Bob Adelman.</TE>
<TE>   Davidson catches many subjects unaware, or aware but not caring
that this white stranger has taken their picture: in repose in a
tenement window, waiting in a surplus food line, lounging outside a
barbershop, whispering to father, asleep on a newspaper bed on a
beach or shoeless on a park bench. A young Louis Farrakhan sits at a
Malcolm X rally as a somber crowd watches. In some pictures, eyes
stare back at the camera; in the rest, folks just carry on with their
lives, their work.</TE>
<TE>   The Southern photographs repeat many of the Northern images:
Grandmother and granddaughter embrace in church, fans in hand. Black
miners, dirty from the day's labor, trudge home. While the same
people may be found in New York, even in similar settings, Davidson
lets us know this isn't Harlem by the atmosphere he captures. The
"white" toilet and restaurant signs, the seated white boss looking
down on the black man in the ditch, the backyard chicken coop and 4-H
float, the black nannies and their white charges resting under a
magnolia tree, the cotton pickers, a boy with a mule -- these shout
"South" -- summon up America's era of apartheid and distinguish
themselves from New York street scenes.</TE>
<TE>   Davidson's skill with the camera lies in the intimacy he brings to
each shot. His pictures put the viewer in the scene, behind, for
instance, Freedom Rider John Lewis' bandaged head. We watch as Martin
Luther King Jr. listens pensively, and Freedom Riders, sprawled on a
floor, raise hands to cast votes. Or we're on the bus, with a long
line of police cars trailing outside a window, as it passes white
hecklers or combat-suited soldiers. Or we're in Birmingham's Kelley
Ingram Park as hoses blast. A girl is arrested before a movie marquee
that screams, "Damn the Defiant!"</TE>
<TE>   There are few pictures of the famous; most of these men and women
are anonymous except for the photographer's recording, but it was
they who made the movement, not the well-known people (whom the
movement made).</TE>
<TE>   Davidson's black-and-white images are both familiar and new. We've
seen these people and these scenes before -- these moments, this
epoch, is so seared into our minds -- but not with this clarity. So
many seem to be thinking, not posing, not arranging face and body to
present themselves in any special way, but thinking. When they look
straight at us, blacks, whites, Klansmen, policemen, miners,
children, they all seem to say, "Here I am. This is me. Take me as I
am."</TE>
<TE>   In assembling these pictures, the story that Davidson tells is one
of resignation, anger, courage and triumph. Not surprisingly, the
closing section contains photos of 110-year-old Mother Brown, caught
on a New York Harbor cruise and in her Harlem home. You can almost
hear her delight -- see her delight -- as she sees the Statue of
Liberty from the deck of the cruise ship.</TE>
<TE>   Historian Deborah Willis in her foreword to "Time of Change" calls
Davidson "both participant and observer," but you will not feel or
see him in these pages. He steps aside to tell you, as Congressman
John Lewis' introduction says, "It did happen."</TE>
<TE>   It did happen. These people did live this way and act this way and
do these things, and we have to be thankful Bruce Davidson was there
to capture and record them and remind us now.</TE>

<HD>When the terror of battle gives way to the love of combat</HD>
<DH>War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning, by Chris Hedges,
PublicAffairs: 212 pp., $23</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joanna Bourke</AU>
<BD>Joanna Bourke is the author of "An Intimate History of
Killing" and "The Second World War: A People's History."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chris Hedges never flinches when describing the complex reality of
contemporary armed conflicts. As a veteran war reporter from the
killing fields of El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Colombia, the
West Bank, Gaza, the Sudan, Yemen, Algeria, the Punjab, Romania, the
Persian Gulf, Turkey, northern Iraq, Bosnia and Kosovo, Hedges
bellows out a reminder that war is ugly and morally perverse yet also
profoundly alluring. Combat is a drug that is polluting and
addictive. War fulfills many of humanity's fantasies, giving meaning
to our lives by drawing attention to the trivia of placid
domesticity.</LD>
<LD>   On the front lines, Hedges (a reporter formerly for the Christian
Science Monitor, among others, and now for the New York Times) spoke
with many ordinary men and women who said they derived pleasure out
of acts of extreme violence against others. Combatants are often
unabashed about their eagerness to kill. As American forces have
learned since the Vietnam War, when fear is eliminated from combat,
many other restraints to violence are also removed. War photographer
Tim Page, when asked to compile a photographic book that would "take
the glamour out of war for good," responded: "Take the glamour out of
war! I mean, how the bloody hell can you do that? ... It's like
trying to take the glamour out of sex, trying to take the glamour out
of the Rolling Stones .... It just can't be done."</LD>
<TE>   War's dark charm must be resisted, however. Without exception, war
brutalizes. Few war journalists are as sensitive as Hedges to the
humiliation that pervades war culture. During the Persian Gulf War,
Hedges observed the monstrous ease with which American explosives
transformed battalions of young Iraqis into dismembered carcasses. He
writes with passion about the "cold and brutal efficiency of
industrial warfare."</TE>
<TE>   Honor and courage crumble and, as Hedges shamefacedly admits, even
journalists like himself ended up using their friends as shields
against bullets. Indeed, this entire book is a powerful indictment of
the role played by war journalists. The willingness, even eagerness,
of large sections of the media to assume responsibility for
maintaining the morale of service members and civilians is dangerous.
Their willingness (during the Gulf War, for instance) to cooperate
with strict censorship constraints was scandalous. By ensuring that
the victims remained "faceless and nameless phantoms" within
entertaining tales of daring deeds, the media abnegated their
responsibilities. War journalists and photographers "wanted to be
used." They were seduced by the glamour of war and knew they were an
integral part of the war effort.</TE>
<TE>   Hedges is man enough to include himself in his unflattering
assessment of the press corps. After all, he also felt immense relief
when tons of explosives decimated his country's enemies. Hedges'
tortured complicity in the violence of war makes for uneasy reading,
but his keen sense of empathy never abandons him. The weak cries of a
dying El Salvadoran rebel in 1982, crooning a final "sad cadence" for
his mother, cut through "the absurd posturing of soldiering."
Survivors are left with the memory of such pitiful cries. In the
words of a British soldier writing to his mother after the Battle of
the Somme in 1916: "I have witnessed a terrible sight that I shall
never forget as long as I live... they had no feeling whatever for us
poor chaps." War stories are composed out of such gut-wrenching
encounters between terrified individuals.</TE>
<TE>   For those people on the front lines, the terror of battle makes
slipping into barbarity easier. Individuals suddenly find themselves
consumed with bloodlust. Respect for strangers vanishes. The enemy is
dehumanized--warriors become "rodent exterminators," as American
troops in the Pacific during World War II styled themselves. When
enemy soldiers are classified as inhuman, they all became fair game.</TE>
<TE>   Such notions tie into ideas in common circulation about humans and
warfare: It is in man's instincts to kill. There is no point in
feeling guilty for what is inherent in human nature. Even decent
warriors find themselves collecting ghoulish mementos from the
corpses of their enemy. For instance, Hedges described the way Iraqi
officials during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s squatted "like big
game hunters" over the bodies of slain men, reveling in their prowess
as martial heroes.</TE>
<TE>   Hedges has no illusions about the capabilities of Americans to act
in a similar fashion. Carnevalesque rituals help making war bearable:
They forge an individual's identity as a "warrior" engaged in a
life-or-death struggle. Gruesome rites also cement group bonds and
comradeship among men who are far from both their prewar personas and
society back home. In the grotesque, men are able to confront "the
horror, the horror."</TE>
<TE>   Even at some distance from the killing zones, war corrupts.
Morality is muddled. Hedges shows how the possibility of imminent war
silences all that is humane within society. He attacks the ease with
which many people view real-life military violence on television
without any sense of unease.</TE>
<TE>   Evil-doings became the sole property of the enemy. "Our" boys
always fight an honorable war. Even in the cool calculation of many
military histories and war journals, it is common to read that
atrocious behavior committed by "our side" should remain outside any
censorious gaze. In other words, in the heat of battle, atrocious
behavior easily becomes an integral and excusable part of warfare.
The disproportionate use of violence and spectacular demonstrations
of brutality are part of the Western arsenal. The responses of
American civilians to the wars and military interventions that have
been ordered in their name tell us more than we may perhaps want to
know about our own society's heart of darkness.</TE>
<TE>   Within this gory articulation of the experience of war, Hedges
attempts to provide a solution. He is no pacifist. He admits that he
supported armed intervention in Sarajevo and Kosovo, and he claims
that this book was written "not to dissuade us from war but to
understand it." Nevertheless, he urges that a powerful brake be
applied to our warmongering impulses. How this is to happen is less
clear. Hedges convincingly argues that even a "just" war turns its
participants into monsters. Hedges really wants us to believe that
the "force that gives us meaning" is not war but love. He exhorts
readers to embrace Eros instead of Thanatos, love instead of death.
In his words: "Love, in its mystery, has its own power. It alone
gives meaning that endures .... Love has power to resist in our
nature what we know we must resist, and to affirm what we know we
must affirm." But love is one of the main mechanisms enabling people
to hate. In the words of Capt. Julian Henry Francis Grenfell, writing
to his mother in England in 1915, just before he was killed: "It is
all the best fun. I have never, never felt so well, or so happy, or
enjoyed anything so much .... One loves one's fellow-man so much more
when one is bent on killing him."</TE>
<TE>   Hedges' call for an honest confrontation with America's past is
forcefully heard throughout this book. War's addiction, the "Oz-like
world" of repression and deception and the mythical dreamland of the
military crusade, are to be feared. Our responses to terrorist
attacks must not be allowed to distort democracy. In Hedges' words:
"The whole truth may finally be too hard to utter, but the process of
healing only begins when we are able to at least acknowledge the
tragedy and accept our share of the blame." This book is an example
of the best kind of war journalism: It is bitterly poetic and
ruthlessly philosophical. It sends out a powerful message to people
contemplating the escalation of the "war against terrorism."</TE>

<DH>Paradise Alley, A Novel, by Kevin Baker, HarperCollins: 676
pp., $26.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Adam Bresnick</AU>
<BD>Adam Bresnick writes for several publications,
including the Times (London) Literary Supplement.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On July 1, 1863, Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia
fought the Union's Army of the Potomac on the fields near Gettysburg,
Pa., in one of the first major Civil War battles to be contested on
Northern soil. Most of the Union Army's soldiers hailing from New
York City were sent to the front, leaving the teeming city to be
defended by about 1,000 National Guardsmen, 200 members of the
Invalid Corps and 700 sailors from the Navy yard, as well as the
Metropolitan police.</LD>
<LD>   While this decision no doubt helped the Union's cause at
Gettysburg, it worsened an already precarious situation in a city
seething with anti-war sentiment in the wake of the nation's first
Conscription Act, which had taken effect four months earlier. Many
recently arrived Europeans had come to New York to flee the conflicts
of the Old Country, and when these immigrants were called upon to
fight and die in what they perceived to be a war to defend the rights
of the American Negro, they were enraged.</LD>
<LD>   But the Conscription Act allowed those with a disposable
$300--close to an average worker's yearly salary--to buy their way
out of the draft, thus ensuring the absence of all but the most
idealistic members of the middle and upper classes from the bloody
battlefield of Gettysburg. This piqued the rage of New York's working
class, which rightly saw that it would bear the brunt of the act.</LD>
<TE>   On July 11, a Saturday, 1,236 names were chosen at random; by
Monday, New York City had exploded in what would turn out to be one
of the worst riots in American history, a three-day proletarian
potlatch of 70,000 rioters that left about 100 people dead and caused
more than a million dollars in property damage.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Baker's ambitious historical novel, "Paradise Alley,"
recounts the terrifying story of New York's Draft Riots as lived by a
cast of fictional characters, most of whom hail from Ireland and all
of whom have had lives filled with appalling violence and disruption.
The chief historical researcher for Harold Evans' bestselling "The
American Century" and author of the acclaimed "Dreamland," a novel of
the golden era of Coney Island, Baker has carried out his research
with extraordinary dedication, familiarizing himself with every
imaginable aspect of the Draft Riots. His vivid imagination and
forceful prose make the mayhem of these three days unusually
palpable.</TE>
<TE>   Having been awakened from our 1990s idyll of endless prosperity
and security by the terrorism of Sept. 11, it is bracing to read of
another awful moment in New York's history, a vertiginous time in
which it appeared that the city was on the brink of being overrun by
violence and chaos.</TE>
<TE>   Ruth Dove is a ragpicker from Paradise Alley, a street of
tenements in the 4th Ward of New York City populated by recently
arrived Irish and Jews. Ruth fled the potato famine in the company of
Dangerous Johnny Dolan, a wildly sadistic lowlife who had the grit to
force his way through the dying Irish countryside, eating anything he
could lay his destructive hands on and wreaking havoc along the way.</TE>
<TE>   Baker flashes back to the "Year of Slaughter" in lacerating prose
that conveys the sheer horror of the starvation with visceral
clarity. Eschewing euphemism and metaphor, he achieves a
hallucinatory realism packed with sensory detail, demonstrating why
historical fiction is able to trump conventional historiography. No
straightforward account of the famine I have read is as grisly as the
literary meal Baker serves up.</TE>
<TE>   Among the various characters in the novel are Billy Dove, an
escaped slave who marries Ruth after Johnny Dolan leaves for the West
Coast; the prostitute and hot-corn vendor Maddy Boyle; her lover and
protector Herbert Willis Robinson, a reporter for the New York
Tribune; Finn McCool, a Tammany ward operative and fireman; and
Horace Greeley, the real-life editor and publisher of the New York
Tribune.</TE>
<TE>   These characters speak the argot of the day, and while no doubt
their language is somewhat stylized, Baker never lets it become too
mannered. Alternating between first-person and third-person narrative
and seamlessly switching historical frames, Baker offers a canvas of
New York City immigrant life in the mid-19th century, as well as a
visceral portrait of the city in turmoil during the Draft Riots.</TE>
<TE>   The book's literary naturalistic methodology evokes the writings
of Emile Zola, since Baker's painstaking research has allowed him to
develop an encyclopedic knowledge of his chosen topic, but the
novel's first-person sections have a somewhat experimental feel,
complicating the book's psychology. Baker allows each character to
function as what John Dos Passos called a "camera eye," recording the
violence of the events directly, without the distance of conventional
authorial omniscience.</TE>
<TE>   Plot as such is not the book's strong suit, for while Baker has
skillfully woven the strands of his narrative into a coherent tale of
rioting New York, the story does not offer a great deal in the way of
suspense or psychological transformation. Indeed, the characters of
"Paradise Alley" are perhaps a bit too static, given the magnitude of
the events in which they participate. Still, when Baker is at his
best, he brings home the violence of the Draft Riots with remorseless
vitality. In its presentation of the slow burning and mutilation of
Col. O'Brien of the 11th Volunteers by a mob of angry Irishwomen, its
account of the lynching of anonymous blacks by draft resisters and
its implacable depiction of the squalor of tenement life, "Paradise
Alley" reveals the terror and violence of the immigrant experience in
19th century New York.</TE>

<HD>Beware the exertions of the scholar-squirrel</HD>
<DH>Melymbrosia, A Novel, by Virginia Woolf, Cleis Press: 280
pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vivian Gornick</AU>
<BD>Vivian Gornick is a contributing writer to Book
Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Virginia Woolf once wrote of William Hazlitt that she prized him
because of his "sensibility to all those emotions which disturb the
reason and make it often seem futile enough to spend one's time
slicing things up finer and finer with the intellect when the body of
the world is so firm and so warm and demands so imperatively to be
pressed to the heart."</LD>
<LD>   The same could easily be said of Woolf herself, as a critic and
essayist. Open any one of "The Common Reader" collections or dip into
the "Writer's Diary" or re-read "A Room of One's Own" and you are in
the presence of a writer whose authority is established by virtue of
the encompassing talent for loving literature with which she, too,
presses the warm body of the world to her heart. With her novels,
however, it's a different proposition. In them, responding
brilliantly to the modernist change in writing already strong in her
turn-of-the-century youth, Woolf turned deeply inward, becoming
overwhelmingly alert to the spiritual isolation that human beings
inflict on themselves and one another. Inevitably, in her novels, her
sense of the world as such grew increasingly claustrophobic.</LD>
<TE>   The elements that warred within Virginia Woolf's own famously
anguished being -- as well as in those of the time in which she lived
-- were reflected in the dramatic split in her own work: The
Victorian in her wrote essays and reviews, the modernist wrote
novels. Which of the two Woolfs will survive to pleasure and instruct
the readers of another century is anybody's guess. In certain
literary circles, such a declaration may sound heretical as there are
many--academic scholars, for instance--for whom every word Woolf put
on paper is to be treasured (hence, the massive publication of her
diaries) and every version of every one of her books declared to be
of equal and major interest (a cottage industry in itself).</TE>
<TE>   Woolf's first novel, "The Voyage Out" (1915), now appearing in a
version called "Melymbrosia," contains in embryo her working future
as a fiction writer. A group of English people travel from London to
a South American city and there settle in a villa in sight of the
sea, not far from a hotel for English tourists. Among the people in
the villa are Helen and Ridley Ambrose (she beautiful, intelligent,
40; he a bemused Greek scholar) and their niece Rachel Vinrace
(anxious, dreamy, music-loving, a virgin of 24); among the tourists
are Terence Hewet and St. John Hirst, two perfectly decent young men
in their late 20s, still untried, filled with undergraduate cynicism.
Various encounters ensue among the women, the men and the tourists in
the hotel, and Terence and Rachel, breaking through a brooding fear
of life, fall in love. The day after they become engaged, she
contracts typhoid and quickly dies. End of story.</TE>
<TE>   The book contains all the major themes that Woolf would bring to
fruition in her two agreed-upon masterpieces, "Mrs. Dalloway" and "To
the Lighthouse." At one point in "The Voyage Out," Rachel muses on
"these enormous spaces of silence in which our deeds and words are
but as points of rock in an ocean." Later, Terence complains, "The
truth of it [is] that one is never alone, and one never is in
company.... [We each live in a bubble]. You can't see my bubble, I
can't see yours; all we see of each other is a speck.... No one gets
inside; but they colour stain the bubble. So, it follows, we're never
alone and we never get out."</TE>
<TE>   And then there is the bitterness over women and men that became
Woolf's permanent metaphor for her vision of life as brutishly
isolating. "After all," says Rachel to her would-be lover, "what's
the use of men talking to women? We're so different. We hate and fear
each other. If you could strip off my skin now you would see all my
nerves gone white with fear of you." She speaks of the domestic
tyranny of her father and how she has come to see it mirrored in the
world of men at large, and then she says, "When you think that you
have only one life -- just for a second and all that waste of sea
behind you and before you -- and that other human beings should
interfere with the smallest amount of it -- then you hate them more
than anything in the world. I shall never never have all the feelings
I might have because of you." From this speech to "Mrs. Dalloway" was
a straight shot.</TE>
<TE>   What Woolf understood -- early -- is that what people most want is
to stand revealed before one another; at the same time, what they
most fear is self-revelation. In "Mrs. Dalloway" and "To the
Lighthouse," the longing and terror would become fully achieved.
Here, in this first novel, she was just starting to grasp her subject
and, not knowing how to play it out, could only suggest the largeness
of her insight--and then kill off her protagonist.</TE>
<TE>   She began writing "The Voyage Out" in 1909, at age 27, under the
working title of "Melymbrosia" (a word whose meaning is never
explained) and, according to Woolf scholar Louise De Salvo, became so
fearful of her own socially critical stance that, under pressure from
friends and relatives, she worked for a number of years to purge the
manuscript of what she was told were incendiary passages. As a
result, De Salvo claims, a much tamer, more polite, infinitely less
powerful book emerged.</TE>
<TE>   De Salvo, who wrote a much-debated biography of Woolf as an
"incest survivor" growing up in a "dysfunctional" family, has spent
seven years reading through 1,000 manuscript pages (long ago
deposited with the Berg Collection at the New York Public Library) in
order to reconstruct the so-called original novel: the book we now
have in hand. The claims she makes for its greater importance are
extravagant indeed.</TE>
<TE>   To begin with, De Salvo declares "Melymbrosia" "an immensely
political, often savagely satirical piece of work," one that
"bristles with social commentary and impresses the reader with
[Woolf's] engagement with the most significant issues of her time ...
labor unrest ... suffrage ... parliamentary debates ... the changes
occurring in religion ... new developments in psychology ... the
effect of illegitimacy upon personality ... the excitement of
airplanes; the problem of road repair...." What's more, De Salvo
continues (all this in her introduction), it provides "an insightful
portrayal of the effects of abuse upon the psyche of a young woman; a
fierce critique of imperialist and sexual politics; a discussion of
the interrelationship among childrearing practices, empire-building,
and oppression as insightful and profound as that of her later 'Three
Guineas.' "</TE>
<TE>   The uninitiated -- that is, the common -- reader stares in wonder
at these words after the book has been read. Fierce? Savage?
Bristles? Gee, it all went right by me. In fact, "Melymbrosia" is
exactly what a young writer's first draft of a novel should be, which
makes "The Voyage Out" exactly what the published version of a
talented writer's first novel should be: better written, more
artfully presented and with the same ideas on board.</TE>
<TE>   Woolf, however, doesn't "bristle" anywhere, either in
"Melymbrosia" or in "The Voyage Out." The first version is as tame as
the second; only the first sometimes presents the insights with the
crude strength of the sentence or passage less well written. But
nowhere are these insights extended, developed or set up so that the
reader will feel the real force of social complaint. Every one of the
long list of "subjects" De Salvo claims for Woolf's "engagements" is
alluded to in one- or two-line exchanges, once in a while in a
paragraph or two.</TE>
<TE>   It was the young D.H. Lawrence, starting out at the very same
time, who was doing what is here claimed for Woolf: boiling over in
print from the very start. "Sons and Lovers," published in 1912, is
the work of a pugnacious, working-class writer who, smoldering with
thwarted manhood and class misery, emerges with all his literary guns
blazing. But the young Virginia Woolf, certainly as ambitious a
writer as Lawrence, is, in 1915, a cautious young woman immensely
constrained by the class into which she has been born and just
beginning to emerge from the shadows and cotton wool of her own
magnificently disturbed spirit. Ultimately, her "complaint" would
prove as profound and as psychologically compelling as was that of
Lawrence, but her sense of it, just now, is oblique, in both the
early and the late versions of this first novel. She has not the
chutzpah that Lawrence was born with -- or, in the jargon of our day,
"the sense of entitlement" -- with which to imagine fully what is not
yet clearly seen. For that, 10 more years of life and work would be
necessary: "Mrs. Dalloway" was published in 1925.</TE>
<TE>   Woolf scholars will be glad to sit with "Melymbrosia" and "The
Voyage Out" propped on the desk, side by side. For me, the best thing
about the exercise was that it sent me back to "The Common Reader," a
collection of short literary pieces that does for me what Tolstoy
said great writing should do: Make the reader laugh and weep and love
life more.</TE>

<DH>No Way to Treat a First Lady, A Novel, by Christopher
Buckley, Random House: 292 pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jacob Heilbrunn</AU>
<BD>Jacob Heilbrunn is an editorial writer for The Times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Christopher Buckley is, to borrow Major Bagstock's self-assessment in
Charles Dickens' "Dombey and Son," a devilishly intelligent fellow.
In his bestseller "Thank You for Smoking," Buckley mocked the pieties
of political correctness. Now, in his novel "No Way to Treat a First
Lady," Buckley has surpassed himself. He has become a presidential
historian. The result isn't humorous; it's hilarious.</LD>
<LD>   The Clinton presidency might seem beyond parody. But Buckley
offers something even wackier: a parallel universe in which Hillary
Rodham Clinton is fondly remembered as a meek tea-serving first lady.
It is First Lady Elizabeth Tyler MacMann who is loathed for her
grasping ambition by a public only too ready to believe the worst of
her. The trial of the century results when she is accused of using a
historic Paul Revere spittoon to assassinate her philandering
husband, President Ken MacMann. Our story opens with President
MacMann in the Lincoln Bedroom, grunting and wheezing on top of his
favorite mistress, Babette Van Anka, Hollywood starlet, singer and
activist. Afterward, after immersing the presidential member -- still
raring to go, thanks to a solution of Viagra -- in an ice-cold carafe
of water, MacMann returns to his own bedroom, but his dissimulatory
efforts are most unavailing. Beth is not fooled; an argument ensues;
next morning, the president is found dead.</LD>
<TE>   "Beth," as the first lady is known, has no choice but to turn to
her jilted lover and the country's leading trial attorney, Boyce
"Shameless" Baylor. A canny self-promoter, Baylor leaks the news of
their first meeting so that hundreds of TV cameras and reporters can
film him outside his Manhattan office waiting to meet her: "[M]aybe
-- just maybe -- to make his revenge perfect, he would deliberately
lose this one. But so subtly that even the Harvard Law bow-tie
brigade would hem and haw and say that no one, really, could have won
this one, not even Shameless Baylor."</TE>
<TE>   But as he falls in love again with Beth, Baylor throws himself
into the trial. No fewer than three connecting suites at Washington's
tony Jefferson Hotel were, Buckley reports, transformed into a
command post; a television studio so that Boyce can comment live at a
moment's notice; a fitness and meditation center complete with oxygen
tank; and, most important, a ground zero room that is immune to
bugging. For Boyce's audacious thesis isn't simply that Beth is
innocent. It's that a vengeful Secret Service and FBI agent found the
president dead and embossed his forehead with the fateful Paul Revere
mark to inculpate Lady Beth Mac, as she was known among the White
House staff.</TE>
<TE>   Although the narrative starts to careen out of control once
Buckley has Baylor impregnating the first lady and getting mixed up
with shady Central Americans, Buckley's sheer verve makes up for such
lapses. In one courtroom scene, an FBI agent testifies that he
discovered Beth vomiting in the bathroom after her husband's death.
"The TV commentary that night," Buckley writes, "featured detailed
analysis by criminologists, gastroenterologists and psychologists on
the subject of vomiting in general and whether doing it in the
presence of law enforcement is a reliable indicator of guilt."
Buckley sews up the narrative by letting Beth go free because--no, it
would be wrong to give away the ending. Suffice to say, President
MacMann's poor vice president, Harold Farkey, loses the election to
an opponent whose first piece of legislation is the Lincoln Bedroom
Protection Act.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Henry Adams, whose "Democracy" created the genre of the
Washington novel, Buckley does not seek to evoke consternation about
the fall of the American republic. On the contrary, "No Way to Treat
a First Lady" is really a nostalgic paean to the antics of the
Clinton administration. No scolding moralist intent on discovering
broader lessons in the president's indiscretions, Buckley revels in
the buzz and spin control efforts of the president's janizaries and
lawyers, reproducing them word for word with uncanny fidelity.</TE>
<TE>   No doubt Clinton's legacy will continue to be debated, with the
revisionists arguing that he was really, as Joe Klein put it in his
book, "a natural." If Clinton was hardly the most successful of
presidents, he was surely one of the most entertaining. Perhaps
Buckley, in his bemusement at both right and left with the media and
lawyers in between, has written the most discerning social history of
the Clinton era that will ever appear. It is a feat that will be
difficult to replicate. So let us declare: a memorial Paul Revere
spittoon to be awarded, whenever appropriate, to the presidential
historian who strives to match this heroic and pioneering effort.</TE>

<DH>Secrets: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers, by
Daniel Ellsberg, Viking: 498 pp., $29.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>George C. Herring</AU>
<BD>George C. Herring is the author of "America's Longest
War: The United States and Vietnam, 1950-1975."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The publication of Daniel Ellsberg's memoir, "Secrets," at this
particular moment is undoubtedly coincidental, but there is an eerie
timeliness about it. Rumors of war abound, this time perhaps for a
unilateral preemptive full-scale attack unprecedented in American
history. Decisions are being made on the basis of secret information
that will be divulged, in Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld's
words, "only if and when the president decides that he thinks it's
appropriate." It is this arrogance and secretiveness that are at the
heart of the events in Ellsberg's book and that, he believes, pose a
grave threat to the democratic process.</LD>
<LD>   "Isn't it after all only history? Does it really matter?" With
these dismissive words, Ellsberg recalls, Sen. J. William Fulbright
(D-Ark.) in 1970 refused to make public the Pentagon Papers, the
top-secret internal history of America's early involvement in Vietnam
commissioned by Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara in 1967.</LD>
<TE>   It was only history, perhaps, but it was this history that finally
persuaded an already deeply skeptical Ellsberg that the war in
Vietnam had no basis in legitimacy and that led him to do something
he believed would land him in jail. He purloined the report from the
Rand Corp. in Santa Monica, where he worked, and released it to the
New York Times, an action that caused a furor in the country and in
the White House and set into motion events that led to Watergate, the
fall of Richard Nixon's presidency and the end of the Vietnam War.</TE>
<TE>   The story has been told before, most recently in Tom Wells'
gossipy and critical biography, "Wild Man: The Life and Times of
Daniel Ellsberg," but "Secrets" gives Ellsberg's version of these
dramatic events. It provides a personal account of his conversion
from gung-ho Marine and Cold War defense intellectual and bureaucrat
to antiwar zealot prepared to go to prison to stop a war he had come
to despise. The book also offers a valuable glimpse into the workings
of the national security bureaucracy in the heyday of the Cold War
and a searching analysis of the government secrecy that helped
sustain it.</TE>
<TE>   Ellsberg's connections to the war in Vietnam are quite remarkable.
He first traveled there in 1961 and claims that during the visit he
began to doubt that the United States could achieve its goals. His
first day at the Pentagon as a lower-level official was Aug. 4, 1964,
the day of the second alleged attack on U.S. destroyers in the Gulf
of Tonkin, which, although it surely did not take place, led to the
first U.S. bombing of North Vietnam. During 1964-65, the period of
then-President Johnson's stealthy movement toward full-scale war,
Ellsberg worked closely at the Pentagon on Vietnam issues with John
McNaughton, McNamara's top assistant. In that capacity, he even
presented the government's position at several campus teach-ins. He
then worked in Vietnam for two years at the "rice-roots level" with
the legendary counterinsurgency experts Edward Lansdale and John Paul
Vann.</TE>
<TE>   After returning to the United States, he was part of the team that
wrote the Pentagon Papers. In March 1968, he joined the task
force--headed by McNamara's successor, Clark Clifford--that
reevaluated U.S. policy after the Tet Offensive. He later helped
draft National Security Study Memorandum 1, a survey of past policies
and future options designed to shape the Nixon administration's
policies toward the war.</TE>
<TE>   In an era rife with controversy, Ellsberg is one of the most
controversial figures, hero to some, traitor to others. Brilliant and
charming, he never achieved what some had expected of him. Intense,
zealous and flamboyant, he admits to becoming "obsessed" with Vietnam
-- hardly unique to him in those days -- and having been under a
psychiatrist's care.</TE>
<TE>   What he seeks to show in "Secrets" is that his conversion from
hawk to dove was an entirely rational response to specific events. In
August 1964 and afterward, he saw the way the Johnson administration,
and especially the president, played fast and loose with the truth.
As a civilian in the Viet Cong-dominated Mekong Delta, he remained
committed to the war and the Lansdale-Vann approach to it, but he
increasingly questioned the practicality and the morality of the way
it was fought. The Tet Offensive confirmed to him, and to others, its
hopelessness.</TE>
<TE>   But it was his work on the Pentagon Papers that finally convinced
him the war was wrong, not just unwinnable. His research led him to
question the then-fashionable theory that overly optimistic advisors
had led unwary presidents into a quagmire. What he found instead was
that presidents had repeatedly escalated the American commitment,
despite uniformly pessimistic estimates from their advisors, and had
repeatedly lied to the public about what they were doing and the
results achieved.</TE>
<TE>   His subsequent reading of the entire Pentagon Papers, especially
accounts of the early years of American involvement, convinced him
that the United States had been on the wrong side of history in
opposing Vietnamese nationalism: The war had been a "war of foreign
aggression, American aggression." About the same time, he became
involved with the antiwar movement and embraced the principles of
civil disobedience.</TE>
<TE>   The leak on March 10, 1968, of the military's post-Tet request for
206,000 additional soldiers, which he insists was not his doing,
"suddenly opened my eyes to my responsibility as a citizen," he
claims, convincing him that releasing classified material might be
the only way to combat the secrecy system and the "lying machine" and
discredit and perhaps stop the war.</TE>
<TE>   The last third of the book deals with Ellsberg's leaking of the
papers and the response. The outlines of this story are known, but he
provides interesting detail about secreting the papers from the Rand
safes, working for weeks to make copies, trying to persuade key
senators and congressmen to make them public and eventually releasing
them to an old acquaintance also "obsessed" with Vietnam, Neil
Sheehan of the New York Times. The Times decided to publish them
without telling him, and when he learned of the decision, he fled
briefly into the antiwar underground before his arrest.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the story is rich with irony. Had Nixon ignored the
papers or even exploited them politically because they dealt
primarily with his Democratic predecessors, their effect might have
been minimal. But Nixon chose instead to try to stop their
publication -- the first such effort to muzzle the press since the
American Revolution -- and to discredit Ellsberg and deter other
leakers through the illegal actions of a group of petty operatives
known as the Watergate Plumbers. The results, of course, were the
Watergate scandal and Nixon's resignation. And the plumbers'
burglarizing of Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office and the
administration's clumsy intrusion into the judicial process resulted
in the court throwing out Ellsberg's case. There is substantial
evidence that Nixon planned to continue the war after the January
1973 "peace" agreement, and it is entirely possible that the Pentagon
Papers accomplished what Ellsberg set out to do: end the war.</TE>
<TE>   "Secrets" also offers a scathing critique of the system of secrecy
that Ellsberg worked in and eventually challenged. This system came
into being in World War II, became entrenched during the Cold War and
resisted post-Cold War challenges, even to declassify decades-old
documents. It is still alive and doing well in the George W. Bush
White House, considered by many the most secretive administration
since that of Nixon.</TE>
<TE>   In Ellsberg's words, it is an "apparatus of secrecy, built on
effective procedures, practices and career incentives, that permitted
a president to arrive at and execute a secret foreign policy to a
degree that went far beyond what even relatively informed outsiders,
including journalists and members of Congress, could imagine." Few
would deny that some information must be withheld, but Ellsberg
insists that classified material far exceeds the essential demands of
national security and that it is being used by top officials to cover
their mistakes. It is "paternalistic to the point of being
undemocratic," he writes; officials keep the press, the public and
Congress in the dark and then use that ignorance to ignore them.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Ellsberg is a complex individual, and the reasons for his
conversion from hawk to dove and his release of the Pentagon Papers,
as Wells argues in his "Wild Man," may be more complicated than he
acknowledges. In "Secrets," his attack on the secrecy system is
painted in black and white rather than in shades of gray, and he
offers no thoughts on alternatives or how better to balance
legitimate national security needs with the public's right to know.
The book concludes abruptly with the end of his trial. Some may be
tempted to dismiss his arguments. So much has changed since the
attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and Ellsberg's
past may raise questions about his reliability, but skeptics should
put aside their doubts and read the book.</TE>
<TE>   "Secrets" is an often gripping account by a controversial figure
of a tumultuous era that still troubles and divides us. It
underscores the need to understand history in areas of the world
whose destinies we presume to shape. It provides important insights
into the national security bureaucracy that produced the Vietnam War,
the system that helped sustain it and the ethos and code of loyalty
among officials that held it together. If we're looking for a warning
signal as we teeter on the brink of yet another war waged on the
basis of information considered too important to share with the
public, we should look no further than in these pages.</TE>

<BD>Cristina Monet writes for the Times (London) Literary
Supplement, among other publications.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"When we contemplate ruins, we contemplate our own future," writes
Christopher Woodward in "In Ruins." "To statesmen, ruins predict the
fall of Empires, and to philosophers the futility of man's
aspirations. To a poet, the decay of a monument represents the
dissolution of the individual ego in the flow of Time; to a painter
or architect, the fragments of a stupendous antiquity call into
question the purpose of their art."</LD>
<LD>   The concept of ruins captures in ironic suspension the struggle
between human striving, nature and the hand of time. Ruins, Woodward
persuasively argues, are momentous and romantic in essence, with
scant relation to naturalism, rationalism or populism. Demystified,
denatured and destatured, denuded of time's eroding verdure and
antiseptically preserved by the rescue mission of men of science for
the greater elucidation of the past, for the benefit and instruction
of the greatest number -- they remain relics of civilization but they
cease to be ruins: those ineffable inspirators of rumination and
rapture in Western art.</LD>
<TE>   Drawing a narrative arm through the reader's, Woodward sets off on
a free-form but meticulously well-observed and well-traveled ramble
through the highways and byways of his theme. His opening chapter,
"Who Killed Daisy Miller?" takes as its focal point the rise and fall
of that epic architectural emblem of hubris and of the "role of
ruins" debate: the Colosseum.</TE>
<TE>   The ruination of this quintessential "ruin" is signaled by the
excavations of 1874. As the archeologists commence the disembowelment
of its sewers and cellars, the ancient amphitheater expires with a
malarial sigh. Daisy Miller, Henry James' brashly irreverent American
heroine -- lounging at the foot of the cross within the doomed arena,
perversely impervious to the noxious, night vapors -- is a casualty,
and according to Woodward, the last artistic distillation of the
Colosseum's death throes. "I cannot," he remarks with wry sapience,
"find a single writer or painter who has been inspired by the
Colosseum since 1870, and only one exception to the general rule: the
failed painter, Adolf Hitler, and his architects .... Poets and
painters like ruins, and dictators like monuments."</TE>
<TE>   Woodward's meditation oscillates between bright fragments of
insight and anecdote -- they shimmer in fugitive attitudes, then
slide into freshly provocative patterns, scattered over the tides of
time by this seasoned tourist to history's shoreline.</TE>
<TE>   "In Ruins" is a picturesque hybrid of travelogue, personal memoir,
lyric rhapsody, art history and cultural criticism. It draws its
inspiration from sources as disparate, as intimately linked in their
mystic vindication of Christianity's ethos of decay as the necessary
prelude to resurrection: Chateaubriand's "Memoires d'Outre-Tombe,"
Rose Macaulay's "The Pleasure of Ruins," Giuseppe di Lampedusa's "The
Leopard."</TE>
<TE>   Carried along the current of a steady stream of ebullient
erudition, embanked in so slim a volume, one feels churlish in
swimming against the tide of so buoyant a nostalgie, so exhilarate an
outpouring of melancholy grandeur as flows from Woodward's pen.
Romanticists rally to long-lost causes; ruins draw the fire of youth
and the pale, necrotic flame of the perverse; they are Romanticism's
legacy. The Romantic must die young, the ruins decay sublimely -- and
have no traffic with the banal accommodations and indignities that
age is heir to in the interests of longevity.</TE>
<TE>   One wonders what reflection would have elicited had Woodward
extended his critical survey of devastation to include the murkier
purlieus of human metaphor. An analogy might even be drawn from the
corrosive eloquence of Caracalla's baths in Shelley's time in
contrast to the anodyne theme parks of the present.</TE>
<TE>   "In Ruins" concludes on a pensive note that is also a romantic's
call to arms:</TE>
<TE>   "Lampedusa once remarked that if Europe was destroyed by a
hydrogen bomb, London would be immortal in the novels of Dickens but
Palermo would disappear because not a single good writer had recorded
the city on paper. That was before he began to write.... Sta
Margherita, I realised -- and indeed I began to smile -- is more
vivid as a ruin which can be explored with Lampedusa's writings to
hand than if it had survived intact.... The statues have gone, as
have the dolls' house, and the monkey cage. But spring-water still
gurgles into the basin of the siren's fountain, and with the scent of
ragged flowers, and the dusty rays of sunlight streaming through the
ruined walls, Sta Margherita is tenderly, but ecstatically alive."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From 'In Ruins'</TE>
<TE>   " Why, I wondered, does immersion in ruins instill such a lofty,
even ecstatic, drowsiness? ... It is the shadow of classical
antiquity which is the deepest source for the fascination with ruins
in the Western world. Every new empire has claimed to be the heir of
Rome, but if such a colossus as Rome can crumble -- its ruins ask --
why not London or New York?"</TE>

<DH>The Road Less Traveled: A New Psychology of Love,
Traditional Values and Spiritual Growth (25th Anniversary Edition),
by M. Scott Peck, Simon &amp; Schuster: 318 pp., $22.95</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>America was suffering a severe case of the spiritual blahs when the
first 5,000 copies of M. Scott Peck's "The Road Less Traveled" rolled
off the press in 1978. The reasons weren't hard to grasp: Oil shocks.
A failed Southeast Asian war. Grand social experiments discarded or
discredited. Soaring inflation. A president driven from the White
House in disgrace. To that dismal list you could add silly clothes
and breathtakingly inane pop tunes.</LD>
<LD>   Many in the country felt distrustful and dispirited, yet too weary
to begin the arduous task of reversing what President Carter termed
the national "malaise." Such a cultural impasse cried out for a
healer, a prophet, and into this wilderness strode Morgan Scott Peck,
a 40-year-old Harvard-educated psychiatrist with a rigorous
intellect, a flair for penning pithy sentences and his index finger
squarely on the pulse of the national zeitgeist.</LD>
<TE>   Like Soren Kierkegaard, Peck sensed a sickness in the Western soul
and set out to propose a cure. In his briskly written book, subtitled
"A New Psychology of Love, Traditional Values and Spiritual Growth,"
he laid out not only a prescription for individual mental health but
also a template for what he implied could be a national spiritual and
moral reawakening. Arguing that humanity's last, best hope lay in
love, which he formulated as "the will to extend one's self for the
purpose of nurturing one's own or another's spiritual growth," Peck
urged his countrymen to face their personal and collective demons
head on, rather than try to skate past them.</TE>
<TE>   He offered no quick fixes or placebos, no "I'm OK-You're OK"
mental-health consolation prize. Instead he argued that we must
adhere to an endlessly painful and challenging, yet ultimately
rewarding, path of self-scrutiny, honesty and spiritual vigilance.
Mankind's "original sin," Peck postulated in almost preacherly
cadences, was "laziness," the obstinacy or lack of courage that
prevented individuals from owning up to their obligations to
themselves and others. The "tendency to avoid problems and the
emotional suffering inherent in them is the primary basis of all
human mental illness," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Quoting everyone from T.S. Eliot and Eldridge Cleaver to John
Denver and citing the My Lai massacre and the Watergate cover-up,
Peck warned that denying the truth and clinging to "outdated maps" of
reality is the bane of nations no less than of individuals.</TE>
<TE>   "The Road Less Traveled," which is being re-released this month in
a 25th anniversary edition, showcased Peck's Freud-like capacity to
cull and synthesize ideas from a variety of areas (art, history,
mythology), make anecdotal use of his patients' case histories and
write in a way that is both eloquent and entertaining.</TE>
<TE>   But his book stood out from the throng of '70s touchy-feely
self-help manuals for a more controversial reason. In the second half
of "The Road Less Traveled," Peck sought to advance his thesis beyond
psychology into theology. While acknowledging a link between an
austere, guilt-ridden religious upbringing and certain forms of
psychopathology, he asserted that the quest for self-awareness led
inexorably toward God -- or at least to the desire to forge a
relationship with a more "personal" God.</TE>
<TE>   By nurturing spiritual growth in ourselves and others, he wrote,
we are instinctively reaching toward the divine. Only by striving to
emulate God's higher state of being could we hope to overcome the
laziness and delusions that make us slaves to Satan.</TE>
<TE>   For Peck, these Judeo-Christian personifications weren't merely
metaphors. "We must ultimately belong either to God or the devil," he
wrote in a phrase that must have raised a few of his colleagues'
eyebrows.</TE>
<TE>   A student of Zen Buddhism who later would convert to
nondenominational Christianity, Peck wanted to take a sledgehammer to
the wall dividing Reason from Spirituality, a barrier dating from the
18th century Enlightenment that towered over American liberal thought
in the post-World War II period. "This beginning possibility of
unification of religion and science is the most significant and
exciting happening in our intellectual life today," Peck enthused.</TE>
<TE>   A spiritually malnourished American public gobbled up Peck's
prescriptions like peanut butter protein bars. "The Road Less
Traveled" has sold millions of copies worldwide, been translated into
at least 20 languages and set a longevity record for paperbacks on
the New York Times bestseller list, while earning Peck the title of
"national shrink." It also has spawned numerous sequels, including
"People of the Lie" and "The Road Less Traveled and Beyond." Building
on word of mouth, the book got a major boost from Alcoholics
Anonymous and Roman Catholic and mainline Protestant churches.
Publishing sales figures show it's been a big mover in the Bible
Belt.</TE>
<TE>   Through the prism of the past quarter-century, "The Road Less
Traveled" can be seen as a bridge between the neo-Romantic,
consciousness-raising experiments of the '60s and '70s and the
Christian fundamentalist revivalism of the conservative Ronald Reagan
era. It straddled a cultural fault line that separated breezy
heal-thyself guides from the brainy chastisements of books like
Christopher Lasch's "The Culture of Narcissism" (which prompted
Carter's "malaise" remark). Though demanding, Peck's gospel was as
brimming with hope as an Emerson essay, as full of American can-do
attitude as a Super Bowl halftime show.</TE>
<TE>   So how does "The Road Less Traveled" stand up in these renewed
days of national soul-searching? In a way, Peck's book has always
been two books. The first, a compassionate but no-nonsense program
for cultivating adult mental health, is itself a composite: a
parenting guide, a primer on sexuality and love and an informal list
of hints for therapists-in-training. Broken into short, digestible
sections, like the book as a whole, it can be dipped into piecemeal
but deserves a thorough reading.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the main problem with this first book is its sprinkling of
outdated assumptions. Peck posits a world of traditional gender-based
roles and significantly less sexual freedom for women than exists
today. But on the whole, this is a reasoned, humane and jargon-free
appraisal of the human condition that still contains many good,
useful ideas.</TE>
<TE>   So does the "second" book, provided you can handle the abrupt turn
Peck makes into religion, which for many readers is the book's
greatest strength. What's intellectually disconcerting is that, while
attempting to raise his analysis to the realm of theology, Peck
continues to explain things in straightforward psychological terms.
He has "come to conclude that evil is real," he tells us. Yet he
conceives of the devil, in essence, as simply the human tendency to
avoid unpleasant truths. Nothing about pitchforks or hellfire
everlasting. Do we really need a literal Satan to make sense of our
psychological shortcomings? What sort of God we do need is a bigger
question that, to its credit, "The Road Less Traveled" doesn't insist
on answering definitively. What it does insist on is that
psychotherapists should treat their patients' religious beliefs
respectfully and carefully and that no great myth -- psychoanalysis
included -- can afford to omit God from the equation.</TE>
<TE>   Peck's need to elevate psychology to the level of religion seems
traceable, in part, to a perceptible queasiness about human
sexuality. Falling in love, he suggests, is really nothing more than
"genetically determined" lust. Oh, really? At times Peck can sound
more like Mr. Spock than Dr. Spock -- a bit knowing and imperious,
like a higher being who has beamed down to Earth to lecture us
less-evolved creatures chomping our red meat and clutching our false
gods.</TE>
<TE>   But although a single flawed theorem can doom an entire
mathematics treatise to uselessness or, worse, harmfulness, that's
happily less true of a treatise on love and God (if you don't believe
it, go reread "The Divine Comedy"). Despite its rough patches, "The
Road Less Traveled" is a wise, provocative and generous book, still
well worth the price of the journey.</TE>

<LD>Stranger on a Train: Daydreaming and Smoking Around America With
Interruptions, by Jenny Diski, Picador USA: 320 pp., $24</LD>
<LD>   Writer Dan Duane calls books like "Stranger on a Train," "lemonade
books, books about what I did while I was trying to write a book."</LD>
<LD>   Geoff Dyer's "Out of Sheer Rage," about his procrastinations while
intending to write a book about D.H. Lawrence, is a model of this
genre.</LD>
<TE>   Jenny Diski, who writes mainly fiction, but every so often about
travel, is the same messed-up Brit chick, God love 'er, whether she's
writing about Antarctica or traveling around the circumference of
America via Amtrak. She spends almost as much time telling us about
the book she's not going to write as she does in the smoking car,
which is where she meets the characters she writes about. The ratio
of time spent bemoaning American openness is about equal to the time
spent telling us her psychiatric history, which, because we are
Americans, she knows we will listen to with empathy and
understanding.</TE>
<TE>   "Stranger on a Train" is not only a fun book (how un-British), it
is, along with the best of "the lemonade books," an important book.
It challenges the authoritarian voice of the author, which can, in
literature, get way too top-heavy. What seem often to be books by
hugely neurotic thinkers are often books that break down barriers
between writers and readers that have built up like tartar between
literary fashions and threaten to bring down the whole smile, irony
and all.</TE>

<TE>   Confessions of a Pagan Nun, by Kate Horsley, Shambhala: 208 pp.,
$10.95 paper</TE>
<TE>   To the great horror of the book burners, our children have been
having all the fun in the last few years, reading about pre-Christian
magic. It's not the first time pagans have threatened the status quo,
but each new resurrection of a pagan god or goddess is a cause for
feasting.</TE>
<TE>   Kate Horsley's novel presents itself as the account of the nun
Gwynneve's sixth century pagan childhood, imagined from a Gaelic
heretical document. In the novel, Gwynneve remembers her childhood:
her mother, a healer and herb gatherer, and her apprenticeship with a
Druid, when she learned how to write and translate from several
languages, a skill that proved useful in the convent she would be
expelled from.</TE>
<TE>   Many of her ruminations concern the inability of paganism and
Christianity to blend peacefully. She credits Christianity with
advances in education and health, but criticizes its estrangement of
women and its crusade to separate people from the land, making the
Earth "a place of degradation and temptation," and offering heaven in
its stead. "Is it not possible," she wonders, "that instead of
original sin, there is original grace?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Miracle, by John L'Heureux, Atlantic Monthly: 240 pp., $24</TE>
<TE>   Father LeBlanc is a priest in South Boston. He's what most readers
would call a good priest, empathetic, inspirational, committed. But
the church is repeatedly disappointed in him: his views on Vietnam,
delivered from the pulpit, his views on the merits of "papal
infallibility." He's a bit of a loose cannon.</TE>
<TE>   Loose cannons are John L'Heureux's specialty. His loose cannon in
"Having Everything" was a highly respected academic who found himself
wandering into people's houses, uninvited, at odd hours. He writes
quietly, almost tenderly, like Charles Baxter, about faith and about
regular people.</TE>
<TE>   L'Heureux also has a gift for making highly accessible characters,
characters. When they make mistakes, no matter how grave, it is easy
to understand. "You don't have to hate yourself," Father LeBlanc
realizes after a transgression that threatens his calling. "You can
just live."</TE>
<TE>   He comes up against a brick wall of hubris, realizing that he has
become a priest for all the wrong reasons. L'Heureux brings the
priest through his crisis of faith with the same tenderness that
makes all his books such a pleasure to read.</TE>

<LD>The Ice Beneath You, by Christian Bauman, Scribner: 234 pp., $13,
paper</LD>
<LD>   "Freddie Mercury was a genius, and he rocked." It's not what you'd
expect to hear a sergeant barking in boot camp, but Christian
Bauman's impressive "The Ice Beneath You" isn't exactly
standard-issue stuff. Equal parts "Stripes" and "Apocalypse Now," it
centers on Somalia in 1993, during a war that was ignored by CNN
until the disastrous Battle of Mogadishu, which makes a cameo here.
At that point, however, Pvt. Benjamin Jones is back in America,
looking on helplessly, wondering about the fate of his comrades, and
quite unable to get his act together.</LD>
<LD>   Told in alternating episodes that trace Jones' hitch in Africa and
his equally challenging post-Army life as a wayward Greyhound
passenger, San Francisco peep-show performer and eventual dishwasher,
"The Ice Beneath You" depicts a hard-as-nails character who's as
fragile as peace itself. Like his contradictory Gen-X hero, Bauman
served in Somalia, and there's an immediacy here that evokes the
great soldier-writers Tim O'Brien and Thom Jones; but while those
titans tell of Vietnam's endless aftermath, Bauman gives us a hidden
war story closer to our own time.</LD>

<TE>   The White, by Deborah Larsen, Alfred A. Knopf: 224 pp., $22</TE>
<TE>   In 1758, 16-year-old Mary Jemison was abducted from her
Pennsylvania farm by marauding Indians. Mary's true story was first
set down in 1823 by a certain Dr. Seaver, and it is this curious
record of an eightysomething white woman looking back on an
improbable life spent among the Shawnee, Seneca and Delaware tribes
that has inspired poet Deborah Larsen's remarkable novel.</TE>
<TE>   After her parents are summarily scalped, Mary is brought to Ft.
Duquesne (modern-day Pittsburgh) and handed over to two Seneca
sisters mourning the loss of their brother. Re-christened
Two-Falling-Voices, Mary is meant to be cosmic compensation for the
Seneca brother, and, to her surprise, she somehow manages to become a
true sibling to her often-quarrelsome captors. What ensues is both a
stirring adventure tale, as Mary negotiates her way from the Ohio
Valley to Upstate New York amid the Indians, French and English, and
a lyrical meditation on one woman's coming of age.</TE>
<TE>   Larsen's perfect prose captures both the brutality and unexpected
beauty of Mary's life, and we're left with the extraordinarily
disquieting feeling that, aside from moss diapers and the occasional
canoe voyage, Mary's life may have turned out much the same had she
never been kidnapped at tomahawk point. For all its frontier romance,
"The White" is a stubbornly unvarnished tale, in which the Indians
are, thankfully, as full of humanizing flaws as the white settlers
who would wipe them out.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carrying the Body, by Dawn Raffel, Scribner: 126 pp., $18</TE>
<TE>   An enigmatic single mom named Elise returns to her vaguely
dysfunctional childhood home with baby in tow. The baby is suffering
from a mysterious affliction, and Elise's possibly alcoholic sister
-- identified only as "aunt" -- develops an unexplained obsession
with the child. Meanwhile, Elise's father emerges every once in a
while to mutter an incomplete thought before sinking back into the
murk that enshrouds Dawn Raffel's "Carrying the Body" like an
impenetrable fog.</TE>
<TE>   Is it the writer's responsibility to offer the reader a clue of
what's going on? Apparently not, especially when there are more
pressing stylistic raptures to indulge in: It's not sufficient that
Elise's rash-inflicted baby be referred to by a simple Christian
name; instead, he's "James, Jim, Baby, blistering offspring, bottled
at last, asleep at last, at last in Mother's arms and presumed to be
dreaming: Such rich milk! Oh, wheel of my sleep!" As "Carrying the
Body" surges along, enthralled by itself and populated by narrators
who are unable to express themselves in complete grammatical units,
you gradually come to realize -- if you squint hard enough -- that
Elise is gearing up to run away. Good plan.</TE>

<HD>The big picture</HD>
<DH>The New Biographical Dictionary of Film, by David Thomson,
Alfred A. Knopf: 964 pp., $35</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Schickel</AU>
<BD>Richard Schickel reviews movies for Time, makes
television documentaries about the movies and is a contributing
writer to Book Review.David Thomson's need, his glory, is to look at
everything anew.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Thomson's title is, slightly, a misnomer. A dictionary is
generally a compendium of useful information objectively presented.
You do not expect to find in such a volume, even one devoted to so
raffish a subject as the movies, something like this definition of
Sir Charles Chaplin: "the looming mad politician of the century, the
demon tramp." Or this dismissal of John Ford: "No one has done so
much to invalidate the Western as a form." Or this description of Tom
Hanks: " ... [H]e carries the automatic sentiment of a dog in a film
about people."</LD>
<LD>   Is this any way to run a reference book? Possibly not. I disagree
with the easy harshness of these judgments (and with the substance of
at least two of them). I would be happier -- truth in advertising and
all that -- if Thomson had worked some warning word ("critical" is
the one that comes most readily to mind) into the title of this, the
fourth edition of his massive, invaluable attempt to comprehend and
compress more than 100 years of movie history into a single volume.</LD>
<TE>   On the other hand, he more or less cheerfully admits to the messy
rigors of the one-man encyclopedist's life: "The desk, the floor, the
rooms that have made this book are a sea of untidiness on which the
author makes a Columbus-like assertion of knowing where everything
is. Of course, he does not. Notes, reports, articles, pictures ebb
and flow...." A man so inundated is, I think, more than entitled to
his unseemly assertions, his yowls of impatience with the dry
conventional wisdom, the unexamined pieties, that so often attend his
subject.</TE>
<TE>   To some degree, the sheer vastness of Thomson's enterprise renders
it inarguable. By this I mean that its 1,300 entries, many of them
essays thousands of words long, will sooner or later dizzy and
overwhelm anyone who attempts systematically to read it. Who are we
to argue with the huge range of facts he has scooped up off all those
flat surfaces, especially when they are so efficiently marshaled to
his uses? More to the point, how can we dispute the apparent
thoroughness of his viewing?</TE>
<TE>   I have, for example, been a professional movie reviewer for some
35 years and, in one of my other lives, a fairly serious film
historian, someone who never writes about a film figure without
seeing all his available works. But there are many directors
(Jean-Pierre Melville, Jacques Rivette, Yasujiro Ozu, to name three
pretty much at random) about whom he writes with all-knowing
authority but whose work, frankly, I do not know well enough to argue
over with him. If that's true of me -- like Thomson, serving a life
sentence without hope of parole at the cineplex -- how much more true
it must be of the casual filmgoer, looking up someone whose work
caught his eye one night on television. To put the point simply, the
massiveness of his erudition and the brisk confidence of his manner
-- he's an awfully good writer -- render Thomson something of a
dangerous character.</TE>
<TE>   He does make mistakes. Some of them are minor -- the character Mia
Farrow played in "The Purple Rose of Cairo" was a hash-house
waitress, not an usherette. Some of them are the result of careless
updating of previous editions: Richard Attenborough is now
approaching 80, not 70, as Thomson would have it, and a certain
number of careers, alas, now must be written about in the past rather
than the present tense. There are also times when some of his entries
just peter out into a list of unconsidered titles.</TE>
<TE>   All of this is forgivable. And easily correctable. But there are
lapses that are harder to set aside. For example, Stanley Kubrick.
Thomson seems to understand "The Shining" quite precisely for what it
is: an effort to convey dread wordlessly, through the imagery of
emptiness, which was not so much a symbol of its blocked-writer
protagonist's emptiness but its mad extension into his environment.
How is it, then, that he cannot see that a similar silence (about a
different kind of dread, of course) is going on in the equally fine
"Barry Lyndon"? Or that the nonsensical verbosity of "Dr.
Strangelove" (which, in my opinion, is the most perfect of all
postwar comedies) also amounts to a kind of existential silence?</TE>
<TE>   Well, all right, Kubrick is always my test case for cinephiles. He
is much more beloved and appreciated by filmmakers than by film
critics, because he alone of the great moderns was trying to make
films that told their stories imagistically rather than verbally,
which is what all serious directors want to do. It upsets me that
someone as smart as Thomson can't see that. It upsets me, too, to
find him charging John Frankenheimer's "The Manchurian Candidate"
with a "real neglect of Americana." Didn't he notice that when the
liberal senator is shot he is holding a milk carton to his chest and
that he seems to bleed the milk of human kindness? I don't know how
much more dangerously, poignantly "American" an image can be.</TE>
<TE>   There is, in short, sometimes a glibness in Thomson, based surely
on the fact that he cannot possibly find the time to reconsider films
glimpsed long ago and erroneously deconstructed by ever-fallible
memory. And also, perhaps in a desire to show off, to skip
controversially against the populist tide. For example, he finds
himself "skeptical" of Paul Newman's "blue-eyed likability," finding
instead "an uneasy, self-regarding personality" whose "smirking good
humor always seemed more appropriate to glossy advertisements than to
good movies." Ouch.</TE>
<TE>   But then something of Thomson's generally more generous spirit
kicks in. He finds in "The Verdict" that "the action and Boston's
winter light got through the mask and into a raw soul" and something
"more relaxed, grumpier, and truly likable" in the work of Newman's
later years. There is, in passages like this, an implicit
acknowledgment of the movie love he sometimes unpersuasively tries to
deny that must animate anyone undertaking a task as all-consuming as
Thomson's.</TE>
<TE>   The trouble with writing movie history is that eventually everyone
begins to believe his or her own press releases. They get lost in
their own imagery and the rest of us tend heedlessly to follow them
into the swamp of self-regard and, occasionally, self-destruction.
Thomson's need -- his glory -- is to look at everything anew, to test
our automatic assumptions, our hardened, habitual affections, to
suggest the possibility of alternative readings, but finally -- well,
yes, "grumpily" -- to acknowledge that most of the lives he parses
have not been entirely wasted.</TE>
<TE>   Considering Vincente Minnelli, he writes: "When credits seemed to
a boy a protracted teasing of proper expectations, it dawned slowly
that certain names went with certain pleasures. Those recurring names
were the basis of an approach to art: George Cukor, Anthony Mann,
Howard Hawks and -- the most flamboyant -- Vincente Minnelli." He may
have moved on, patient and alert, to the more austere pleasures of
Ozu and his ilk, but, blessedly, his book also contains brief, deft
appreciations not merely of such generally acknowledged masters of
the B picture as Budd Boetticher but also of his more obscure peers,
Jack Arnold and Joseph H. Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   Movies are an art of many mansions. And a book like Thomson's
would be impossible without acknowledgment of that inconvenient fact.
Childlike wonder -- the refusal to confront movies as occasionally
some kind of art for adults -- has been responsible for a lot of
stupid writing about movies. On the other hand, forgetting that
little kid squirming with delight before a giddy Hawks comedy or an
awesome musical invention by Minnelli is also a disaster. Movies are
a medium for double-trackers, willing accomplices in their own
seduction who can yet, when the lights come back on, criticize the
means by which they have been had. And imagine better ways of doing
the job.</TE>
<TE>   No one is better at this "yes, but ... " manner than Thomson.
Earlier editions of his "Dictionary" have been my constant companions
for decades, consulted almost weekly, not so much to check facts but
to test sensibility. I happily welcome this latest revision -- this
looming, surely half-mad enterprise, this demon of defining -- to
their place. May our quarrels never end. And, incidentally, may
Richard Dix, George Brent and Warner Baxter never disappear from
Thomson's pages. They may no longer linger in living memory, but they
are part of the history his book artfully defines and defends in
Alzheimer's Age.</TE>

<HD>When life was a battle for honor and dignity</HD>
<DH>My Losing Season, by Pat Conroy, Nan A. Talese/Doubleday:
406 pages, $27.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Turrentine</AU>
<BD>Jeff Turrentine is an essayist and critic whose work
has appeared in Book Review, the New York Times Magazine and
Slate.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the beginning of his senior year at the Citadel, a basketball
player with literary aspirations climbed aboard the bow of a yacht
docked in the campus marina. As he surveyed the school from his lofty
vantage point, the young man, fresh from an encouraging visit with
his favorite English professor, made a solemn promise to "remember
everything."</LD>
<LD>   Pat Conroy certainly kept that promise. He has built an impressive
30-year career from vividly recounted remembrances of his days at the
Citadel, the South Carolina military college famous for its punishing
caste, or "plebe," system; of his abusive father, an ex-Marine whose
rigidity mutated into unspeakable brutality on the home front; and of
basketball, the game that sustained Conroy throughout his lonely
youth. These three forces eventually combined to form a rich vein
that he has mined for two popular novels, "The Lords of Discipline"
and "The Great Santini." (His most famous and best-selling novel,
"The Prince of Tides," stayed out of the barracks and off the
basketball court but still had plenty to say on the issue of family
dysfunction.)</LD>
<TE>   Few who know the details of the author's life have ever doubted
that "The Lords of Discipline" and "The Great Santini" were really
autobiographies masquerading as fiction. Any lingering doubts are
dispelled by his memoir, "My Losing Season," a spirited paean to the
game of basketball and a bittersweet recollection of the events that
ushered Conroy into his life as a novelist. Once again Conroy returns
to the mine of his youth, specifically to his final year on the
Citadel's basketball team before his graduation in 1967. It was, he
writes, "the year I began to catch small glimpses of the man I was
becoming, moments when all the disfigurements and odd bafflements of
my hidden childhood began to reveal themselves in unfocused glances
into my nature." It was also, he tells us, "the year I learned to
accept loss as a part of natural law."</TE>
<TE>   What Conroy loses, mainly, is basketball games. The Citadel
Bulldogs are by no means the terrors of the Southern Conference, and
this second-string point guard and his teammates feel the sting of
defeat as regularly as (or perhaps a little more regularly than) they
experience the rush of victory. Winning is nice, he admits, but
"[l]oss is a fiercer, more uncompromising teacher, coldhearted but
clear-eyed in its understanding that life is more dilemma than game,
and more trial than free pass. Though I learned some things from the
games we won that year, I learned much, much more from loss."</TE>
<TE>   This hard-won perspective proved invaluable decades later, when
Conroy suffered bouts of depression that left him contemplating
suicide. It was the lesson of his losing season, he suggests, that
saved him by reminding him that life wasn't fair, that winning wasn't
certain and that he had an obligation to go on living nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   In 1967, Conroy was also learning how to deal with his father, the
abusive bully so memorably captured in "The Great Santini" (and later
immortalized by Robert Duvall in the movie of the same name). Readers
and moviegoers who wonder whether Conroy exaggerated his father's
cruelty may be surprised to learn that, on the contrary, he
sugarcoated it. "It was my belief that if I told the truth about
Donald Conroy that I would lack all credibility and that no one would
want to read a book that contained so much unprovoked humiliation and
violence," he writes. "I added touches of humor and generosity to
Colonel Meecham [the fictional stand-in for Conroy's father] that my
father had never displayed in his military life."</TE>
<TE>   Through it all, Pat Conroy's refuge is basketball. As he recounts
the season's games against the Bulldogs' formidable competitors, he
seems possessed by some animating ghost. His memory for the details
of decades-old glories (and ignominies) astounds us ; Conroy is able
to transport us back to these games -- every one of them -- because
he has been transported, seemingly reliving them as he writes. Field
goals and full-court presses are recollected not as statistics but as
the mighty swings of broadswords. At times, "My Losing Season" reads
like a war memoir: There's the same band-of-brothers camaraderie, the
sense that every game is a battle in which honor and dignity (if not
actual lives) are at stake.</TE>
<TE>   Every ragtag team of soldiers needs a gruff but valorous Sarge,
and Conroy delivers one in the form of Mel Thompson, the inscrutable
Bulldogs coach saddled with the unenviable task of molding these boys
-- whose spirits have already been broken by the plebe system -- into
a cohesive team. His inability to do so gnaws at him and causes him
to lash out at Conroy and his teammates, who respond to his often
mean-spirited outbursts with perverse devotion. Conroy, with his
horror-movie of a family life, craves affirmation from his grudging
coach. The peculiar relationship between this affection-starved young
man and this despairing, temperamental older one turns out to be the
most important one in the book and is tenderly wrought.</TE>
<TE>   Pop music lore includes the statement, source unknown, that
"writing about music is like dancing about architecture," meaning
that the act of trying to get on the page an analysis of something as
ineffable and ethereal as music is, in the end, futile. So it may be
with basketball, the quickest and most dynamic of sports: a game to
be watched, not read about. Conroy's love for the sport is
infectious, and he does as fine a job as anyone could of relaying its
poetry and majesty. But after the 10th or 11th play-by-play, readers
may find themselves counting the pages that remain until the buzzer
sounds and Conroy walks out of the locker room into the less
circumscribed world of plebes, professors, parents and girlfriends.
It's off the court where the real transformation is taking place,
here the beleaguered athlete is becoming the self-aware writer.</TE>
<TE>   Conroy is accused by some critics of being a second-string
novelist, a B-teamer unfit to play alongside superstars like Philip
Roth, John Updike and Joyce Carol Oates. It's unfair and ultimately
pointless to compare him to writers whose critical reputations have
earned them Hall of Fame status. Conroy's losing season at the
Citadel taught him, among other things, the importance of hustling
for every basket and the dignity that comes from always trying your
hardest, especially when you have to try harder than the other guy.
Say what you will about him, Pat Conroy doesn't coast or slack off,
and his success is well earned. "My Losing Season" is as heartfelt
and poignant a coming-of-age memoir as they come and a splendid
contribution to the literature of sport.</TE>

<HD>Sticking to the Plan</HD>
<DH>DeBerry philosophy has turned Air Force into a power, but
he's quick to deflect credit</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>AIR FORCE ACADEMY, Colo.</DL>
<LD>Just before Air Force's final game last season, Coach Fisher DeBerry
learned that 12 of his players had broken curfew.</LD>
<LD>   Even though the group included five starters and DeBerry needed a
victory to avoid his first losing season in eight years, he didn't
hesitate in suspending the players. Air Force won the game, 38-37.</LD>
<LD>   "That's Coach. He could have let the young men play who broke his
rules, but he chose not to do that, and I think it's just an
indication of his priorities and values, that character is as
important as anything," Vice Athletic Director Brad DeAustin said.
"He knew there was a risk that we were going to lose that game to
Utah, but it didn't matter."</LD>
<TE>   DeBerry has never wavered from his belief that hard work and
character are more important than anything that happens on the field.
It's a philosophy that has made Air Force one of the winningest
programs in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Air Force has had a losing season just twice in 18 years under
DeBerry -- none since 1993 -- and has gone to 11 bowl games. The
Falcons have had 10 seasons with at least eight wins and are 48-18
the last five years, 11th-best in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Air Force was 5-0 this season heading into Saturday's game against
Brigham Young and was one of 11 undefeated teams in the country. The
Falcons are ranked for the first time in three years after jumping
into the poll at No. 21 this week.</TE>
<TE>   The success and DeBerry's approach have made him one of the most
revered figures at the academy, but the humble coach doesn't think
he's done anything special.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife talks about it a lot more than I do," DeBerry said. "She
doesn't think I'm a legacy. She thinks I'm just getting old."</TE>
<TE>   DeBerry is an exceptionally organized person -- he plans some
things months in advance, DeAustin says -- and discipline is a key
part of his approach.</TE>
<TE>   It's a perfect fit for coaching at a service academy, where
football practice is often the easiest part of the day for the
players.</TE>
<TE>   The day typically starts around 6 a.m., when the players wake up,
clean their rooms then march with their squadron. After a brief
breakfast, the players head to four or five hours of classes, eat
lunch and head out for military training.</TE>
<TE>   By the time players get to practice around 4 p.m., they've already
had a full day.</TE>
<TE>   "There's just not enough time. You never feel like you have enough
time," DeBerry said. "Sometimes I wish I could get to know each kid
very, very close and very intimate, and feel like you have more time
to spend individually with the players."</TE>
<TE>   The other two major service academies, Army and Navy, have similar
regimented schedules and the same stringent entrance requirements,
but neither has had the success Air Force has.</TE>
<TE>   DeBerry has a career record of 146-78-1, most all-time by a
service academy coach. In that span, Army is 87-102-1, including 0-5
this season, and Navy is 66-121-1 and has gone through five coaches.</TE>
<TE>   The Falcons have won 11 straight games over Army and Navy,
including a 48-7 rout over the Midshipmen two Saturdays ago. Air
Force has also won the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy 15 times,
including five straight and 13 of 15 under DeBerry. Army has won the
trophy six times, Navy five.</TE>
<TE>   "Air Force has won a lot of recruiting battles," Navy Coach Paul
Johnson said. "Players want to go to the academy that is winning.
It's up to the other academies to mirror what Air Force is doing."</TE>
<TE>   Again, DeBerry is quick to deflect credit.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had good players, committed players, a lot of pride, and
I've been blessed to have an outstanding coaching staff and some
continuity on our coaching staff," DeBerry said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's anything that Fisher DeBerry has done. I just
think I've been blessed to have some great people around me."</TE>
<TE>   DeBerry turned 64 in June but is showing no signs of slowing.</TE>
<TE>   His days during the season are filled with game-planning,
practices, interviews and meetings with school officials and
boosters, and he rarely takes time off in the off-season -- all while
keeping up his ever-positive attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very, very demanding job and he's got the energy and
determination to keep at it, to have his staff keep at it and not
have them get burned out," DeAustin said. "It's a pretty special
talent."</TE>

<HD>Adverse Conditions</HD>
<DH>C.W. Post's Ian Smart and his mother, Joyceline, have
endured more than most</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Our first hurdler jogged around the corner to the neighbors with a
bullet in her hip just after her husband shot her one night in 1986.
Uncertainty pushed her heavy legs; his face gave no clue whether he'd
shoot again.</LD>
<LD>   She wore the bullet maybe a few weeks, and he'd call the hospital
to check on her. She finally supplied instructions:</LD>
<LD>   "Next time, tell him I'm dead."</LD>
<TE>   Joyceline Smart never competed in track hurdles, but let's not
dwell on technicalities. Even at 48 as she watches the second of her
five children, Ian, ring up storybook football yards for C.W. Post on
New York's Long Island ... even as she cheers with the $20 horn she
bought at a reggae show in Manhattan ... even as she knows her son
will thrive as a teacher or maybe even an employee of the NFL ...
she's every bit a hurdler.</TE>
<TE>   Has life thrown you this much distress?</TE>
<TE>   Born the second of 14 children in Jamaica, she spent weekends of
youth washing and ironing siblings' clothes. But first she'd have to
heat the iron. In a coal stove.</TE>
<TE>   As a 16-year-old, she weathered appendicitis.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, she left her husband -- with ample cause.</TE>
<TE>   One night in 1990, right there in the kitchen, she drank some
milk, got something like a cramp in the gut and crumbled to the
floor. "I could not move," she said, "and it was getting worse."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't just that she had given birth six weeks before. Nor that
she had to spend seven days in the hospital for hernia surgery. It
was that she came home to an eviction notice, the last thing you'd
want after hernia surgery.</TE>
<TE>   So she rented a U-Haul, loaded it up, retreated to a friend's
place in Brooklyn and spent the next two months slogging across a
long island taking three children to school.</TE>
<TE>   Money remained scarce, so the power company visited her house in
North Babylon one morning in August 1998. She pleaded; they proceeded
-- to shut off the switch. She spent a fruitless afternoon explaining
her situation at various offices. As she lay on the living room floor
that night for a rare nap, she woke around 11:30 to the holler of a
house guest.</TE>
<TE>   "Mrs. Smart! Mrs. Smart! Fire! Fire!"</TE>
<TE>   A candle had toppled; "the whole place was orange," she said. She
snared her 6-month-old daughter and scurried down the stairs to the
front yard. "I could hear windows popping out and fire going up
through the roof." She stood and watched, then realized Ian remained
in the house. She began screaming until her friend assured her he had
left much earlier with a friend while she slept.</TE>
<TE>   Almost everything burned: photographs, clothes, Ian's football and
track awards from North Babylon High. "Even my car keys burned up,"
she said. "I couldn't move the car. My pocketbook. My license. My
green card. Everything." Soon she began the wrenching process of
sifting through burnt belongings, saving photographs by snipping
burned edges.</TE>
<TE>   Her friend Peggy offered refuge. But Joyceline Smart couldn't
bring herself to invade someone else's house or go to a shelter, so
for two months she lived in her green Nissan Maxima.</TE>
<TE>   The house guest, a friend from childhood, often rode with her. Her
6-month-old daughter, Zenobia, would sleep in the back seat. One
daughter and one son stayed at a neighbor's house. Ian slept for a
while in his yellow Hyundai. North Babylon raised some money for the
family. And Mrs. Smart would park at a 24-hour laundromat to get her
sleep.</TE>
<TE>   Well, try to. Matter-of-factly, she says, "I don't think I sleep.
Ever. The last time I fell asleep, my house burned down. I never
sleep."</TE>
<TE>   She moved to Wyandanch, N.Y., but one recent Sunday morning, Ian
found her on her cell phone in nearby Patchogue.</TE>
<TE>   "Patchogue?" Pause. "Mom, why are you killing yourself?"</TE>
<TE>   She had found weekend work at a nursing home -- nurse's assistant
-- to complement her other job at another nursing home.</TE>
<TE>   She'll come home after midnight and sit up nights sorting mail and
dozing off for a few minutes -- and then it's daybreak and time to
take her father for his cancer treatments.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes she forgets to eat. One day, she sat first in line at a
red light in Central Islip. When she awakened moments later, she
watched the light turn from green to red, all the cars still behind
her.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I say, 'What am I doing wrong?' I always ask myself
that question. I say, 'Am I doing something wrong?' because I always
work so hard, I always try, and I'm not getting anywhere. It doesn't
make sense. So I just leave it alone. If I worry about it, I just
have a headache."</TE>
<TE>   Holding on to Hope</TE>
<TE>   Our second hurdler is listed at 5-9, built as enviably as an
Oregon tree, eight years after showing up for North Babylon track
practice as a ninth-grader and saying, "Coach, can I hurdle?"</TE>
<TE>   "No" was Kurt Langer's answer, and that was that, except that
moments later, a senior walked up and said, "Coach, he can
three-step," a reference to the magic path to hurdling.</TE>
<TE>   "What do you mean?"</TE>
<TE>   "He's over there three-stepping."</TE>
<TE>   Langer revised: "Son, you're a hurdler."</TE>
<TE>   The evidence does suggest: Look now. Here's a football Saturday at
Post. Fans wear Think Smart buttons, touting Ian for the Heisman
Trophy. The Pioneers drill another victim, and the public address
announces that Smart, who was a redshirt his freshman season, has
advanced to 20th on the all-time college football rushing list.</TE>
<TE>   Ian does yet another TV interview. Lately his mother has noticed a
gap in his teeth she never saw before, just from watching his TV
interviews.</TE>
<TE>   It's some unusual football-watching, where you follow one guy's
statistics even more than the score. A long Post play by somebody
other than Smart brings a sigh, because it diminishes the number of
yards Smart can attain on the next play. A Post penalty on offense
causes salivation because it means he might go 90 pretty soon.</TE>
<TE>   You note the bolting speed and the can't-teach-it capacity to set
up blocks, but mostly you count up the yards, which seem to pile up
obediently, all the way to 5,661 in his career, and the points, which
reach 480.</TE>
<TE>   Here we are, in the senior year, in a patch in which his coach,
Bryan Collins, pretty much eats, sleeps, works and fields questions
about why he removes Smart in fourth quarters. He answers yet again:
He recalls being on the other end of somebody running up the score.
He doesn't want Smart amassing a bunch of "empty yardage."</TE>
<TE>   Here we are, and Smart's sister Tameka calls from Utica College,
raving that she saw him on "SportsCenter." And Collins loves Smart's
refusal to hang out at the corner of prima and donna. And the people
at the federally funded Higher Education Opportunity Program love the
way he's an emblem for their program.</TE>
<TE>   Because, well, look now. Here's a Wednesday in the little gym at
Drexel Avenue School in Westbury. Degree already in hand, Ian Smart
helps teach daily from 8 to 2:15. Children from third grade to fifth
line up to learn the soccer toe-trap. One class files out. Another
files in. Teacher Ron McKay motions to "Mr. Smart's corner," a wall
of clippings and numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "How did Mr. Smart's team do on Saturday?" he asks the students.
He points to a piece of construction paper: 43-0. Another: 5-0
(Post's record).</TE>
<TE>   "How many yards did Mr. Smart have?" He points to another piece of
paper: 231. "How many touchdowns?"</TE>
<TE>   The answer comes in various blurts: "Two."</TE>
<TE>   Then McKay points out a newspaper picture of Post linebacker Joe
Gangemi scoring a touchdown. He wants to know why Gangemi scored a
touchdown. Nobody knows. " 'Cause you know why?" McKay says. "Mr.
Smart, he doesn't want to score all the touchdowns. So he lets
somebody else score the touchdowns sometimes."</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Smart beams from the back in his sweat pants, a whistle around
his neck.</TE>
<TE>   The Smart Corner in Westbury is not to be confused with the Wall
of Fame at North Babylon, even though they're both rife with Smart.
The Wall of Fame, a bulletin board, stands in Langer's classroom,
harbor of European history, economics, football and track. The board
remains immaculate, unbothered even by teen chaos, as if the students
don't want to mar it.</TE>
<TE>   The football successes under Coach Terry Manning, the track
highlights under Langer, the hurdles title three days after Joyceline
booted him from the house in a spat both readily discuss with
forgiveness ... it's all up there in news clippings. One clipping
notes the murder of his father in 1995 -- shot by a girlfriend's son
-- and how Ian misses him, proof that sons are good at forgiving.</TE>
<TE>   So look now. "He's now on his way to becoming a successful
citizen; there's just no two ways about it," Langer says.</TE>
<TE>   They're past a time when Smart showed up in Langer's room with
"just like, tears on the ground," Langer says. Past a time when
Langer told Smart he absolutely should not postpone college, should
not get a job, because then he'd never go to college. Past an age
when Smart would hurry to Langer's classroom to borrow a dollar, then
scamper out, and Langer would hear the sneakers squeaking away, then
hear them brake to a halt, then hear them pounding back, then see the
head in the doorway: "Oh. Thank you."</TE>
<TE>   They're to the festive point where Ian Smart wants to buy dinner
for his offensive linemen, and Joyceline Smart wants to cook them
some of her curry goat, curry chicken, peas and rice, dumplings and
oxtail.</TE>
<TE>   They're in this patch where Langer needs help moving his air
conditioner and Smart pops right over. Where Langer says, "He's the
kid that if I went away for a while, I'd say, 'Here's the keys to the
house; keep an eye on it for me.' " Where Langer worries because
Smart worries -- about his mother and siblings. Where they're all so
close -- to potential college all-star games, to potential scouting
combines, to the thought that many NFL things have happened that are
stranger than a 5-9 Division II phenom latching on. The Cardinals and
Dolphins have called, Collins says, but haven't visited.</TE>
<TE>   They're where at the very least, Smart will teach -- hardly a
least at all.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I'm very amazed," Smart himself says.</TE>
<TE>   Because, see here, last Mother's Day, Hurdler No. 2 got his
college degree, with Hurdler No. 1 in attendance. Various family
members commended her. Not once did she ask herself how she'd gone so
wrong.</TE>
<TE>   The rain fell without remorse, the chill wouldn't quit and she
forgot to bring a jacket, yet she ranked it among the most gorgeous
days of her life.</TE>

<LD>GREENBURGH, N.Y. -- Latrell Sprewell is on the outs with management
because of repeated failures to fulfill his professional obligations
off the court. Allan Houston is a responsible captain, but when it
comes to forceful leadership, he hasn't really grabbed the bull by
the horns.</LD>
<LD>   From where Don Chaney sits, it looks as if there's a void in his
locker room and on the court. The New York Knick coach said last week
that he needs more consistency from Sprewell and Houston. Wednesday
after practice, he reinforced that demand with an indictment of their
leadership skills.</LD>
<LD>   "There's a definite hunger for leadership on this team," Chaney
said. "There's no question about that. I've seen a lot of teams. This
team here definitely needs a leader."</LD>
<TE>   Asked who provided leadership last season, when the Knicks
spiraled to a 30-52 record and missed the playoffs for the first time
in 15 years, Chaney didn't mince words.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't have any leaders on this team," he said. "We've got to
have people stepping up and being leaders."</TE>
<TE>   There's no need to put a want ad in the newspaper for a
replacement for retired Larry Johnson, who was identified by Chaney
as the best leader in his seven seasons with the Knicks. There is a
preferred candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Antonio McDyess, who scored 17 points and had 17 rebounds in the
exhibition opener against Boston on Tuesday night and made his
Madison Square Garden debut as a Knick last week, has what it takes
in Chaney's estimation.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether he believes it or not, I think he would be an ideal
leader," Chaney said. "I don't know if he's ever been called upon to
lead, but I've already mentioned to him about his leadership skills.
Some people lead by example, and some lead vocally. I think he can do
both."</TE>
<TE>   Although he achieved All-Star status in Denver, McDyess wasn't
known as a vocal leader. But if that's what Chaney wants, he's
willing. "Yeah, I'll speak out in the locker room," McDyess said.
"It's no problem with me doing that.... It seemed like when I was
doing it in Denver, it went in one ear and out the other. I feel this
team wants to win, and by me doing that, I think they're looking for
me."</TE>
<TE>   When McDyess arrived in New York in a draft-night trade, some
wondered if the down-home kid from rural Mississippi could survive
with such a laid-back demeanor. Chaney bristles whenever the
"laid-back" label is applied to his own coaching style, and he warned
it would be a mistake to judge McDyess by the smiley face on his
cover.</TE>
<TE>   On the first day of training camp, the coach said the newcomer was
the only one who spoke when the team came together in the huddle.
Even when McDyess was working with the second unit, his voice was the
one providing constant encouragement.</TE>
<TE>   Chaney declined to address the question of Sprewell's credibility
after his recent $250,000 fine and indefinite banishment from the
team for failing to report his hand injury in a timely manner.</TE>
<TE>   But Chaney defined a leader as a person who consistently is there
for his teammates, which Sprewell wasn't last season when he blew off
a shootaround in Miami and let his performance slide toward the end.</TE>
<TE>   "To be a leader is a sacrifice, on and off the court," Chaney
said. "You've got to want to do it. You can't just say, 'I'm a
leader.' You've got to show on a consistent basis that you're capable
of leading the team."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he must prod Houston to be more assertive, Chaney said:</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think you should have to continually encourage a guy to
be a leader. You've got to want to be it; you've got to enjoy being
it; you can't be afraid to be it. When you're a leader, it's not so
popular at times because you may say something player doesn't like.
You've got to be able to deal with all of that, and that's a big
step."</TE>
<TE>   Call it a leap of faith, but Chaney believes it's a step McDyess
can take.</TE>

<HD>Blue Jackets' Nash Signs, Then Scores</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rick Nash took a long time to sign his first NHL contract but needed
only two shots for his first goal.</LD>
<LD>   Nash was chosen by Columbus with the first overall pick in the
June draft and just beat a deadline this past Monday to sign his
deal. Had the 18-year-old left wing not reached agreement with the
Blue Jackets when he did, he would've been back with his junior team
in London, Ontario, on Thursday night instead of playing against the
Chicago Blackhawks.</LD>
<LD>   But the deal was done, a three-year contract that could bring Nash
more than $12 million, and his impact was felt immediately.</LD>
<TE>   Nash scored his first NHL goal on his second shot, a tying tally
7:35 into the second period of the Blue Jackets' 2-1 victory over the
Blackhawks. It came on the heels of an impressive preseason that
landed the teenager on Columbus' opening-night roster.</TE>
<TE>   He tied for the team lead with three goals in five exhibition
games and finished second with six points, and now he hopes he is in
the NHL for good.</TE>
<TE>   "Pretty much it's a win-win situation for me," Nash said Thursday.
"Whether I go back to London, it's a good situation there.</TE>
<TE>   "My goal, my expectation is to stay with the team all year. That's
what I'm focused on right now."</TE>
<TE>   He certainly wasn't too focused on the details on his contract.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I'm not too sure what exactly they are," he admitted. "I
haven't really seen it or looked into it too far. But I'm sure
they're pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   OLYMPICS IN 2006?: With the NHL abandoning its North America
versus the World format in the All-Star game in favor of the Eastern
Conference against Western Conference, the question was raised
whether the league would take another Olympic break in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   "Anytime we take a break to go to the Olympics, there are a whole
host of issues that are positives and a whole host of issues that are
negative," Commissioner Gary Bettman said. "There isn't universal
agreement. It's a logistical nightmare for us."</TE>
<TE>   But, will NHL players be in Turin, Italy, in 2006?</TE>
<TE>   Ask again in two years after a new labor agreement is reached
between the NHL and its players.</TE>
<TE>   "We're more focused on 2004 right now than 2006," Bettman said
Thursday from Los Angeles, where he attended the jersey retirement by
the Kings of Wayne Gretzky's No. 99. "Even though the union, at least
at the present time, has decided they have no interest in beginning
discussions sooner rather than later, I think we need to be dealing
with the new collective bargaining agreement before we worry about
going to the Olympics."</TE>
<TE>   This year's experience in Salt Lake City was clearly better than
the NHL's first Olympic venture to the 1998 Nagano Games.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no regrets about going," Bettman said. "But being in North
America relative to coverage, time zones and travel, as difficult as
that is, it's not nearly as difficult as being outside of North
America. But at the appropriate time, we'll weigh it all."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FAST STARTS: Alexander Mogilny is always ready when the games
start to count.</TE>
<TE>   The Toronto right wing scored twice and added an assist Thursday
night in the Maple Leafs' 6-0 win at Pittsburgh. That vaulted the
33-year-old forward into a three-way tie for the active lead for
goals on opening night.</TE>
<TE>   Mogilny has 13 career goals in season openers, joining Detroit Red
Wings teammates Luc Robitaille and Brett Hull for the lead. That
tandem went scoreless Thursday night in a 6-3 win at San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   Maurice Richard and Cam Neely also scored 13 goals in openers, to
trail Dino Ciccarelli and Michel Goulet-- ho top the career list with
14.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose's Adam Oates, the active leader in career opening night
points with 25, was held off the board by the Red Wings. Most of
Oates' damage has been in setting up teammates. Of his first night
points, only one was a goal to go with 24 assists.</TE>
<TE>   That's nothing new for the center, who has led the NHL is assists
in three seasons--including in 2001-02 when he had 64 with Washington
and Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Messier, the New York Rangers' 41-year-old captain, had the
first multigoal game of his career when he scored twice Wednesday in
a 4-1 win at Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess there's a first for everything if you play long enough,"
Messier said.</TE>
<TE>   Messier, with 660 goals, moved into seventh place on the career
list as he opened his 24th NHL season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FANFEST: Welcome to "The Year of the Fan."</TE>
<TE>   The NHL will "celebrate the unique attributes of the NHL fan:
passion, dedication and loyalty." and will select the fan of the year
at season's end.</TE>
<TE>   All 30 teams will choose their own fan of the year and enter that
person into a league-wide pool of finalists. A panel of judges,
including commissioner Gary Bettman, entertainer Denis Leary, and
analyst John Davidson, will pick the winner.</TE>

<HD>One of These Days, Alice ...</HD>
<DH>Brad Garrett wasn't CBS' first choice to play Jackie
Gleason, even though he has long had a kinship with the Great One.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Brad Garrett was a young stand-up comedian working clubs around
the country, he could come home around 1 or 2 in the morning, sit in
front of the television set with a bag of Chee-tos and watch repeats
of the classic 1955-56 Jackie Gleason comedy series, "The
Honeymooners."</LD>
<LD>   Garrett immediately felt a kinship with the Gleason who played the
blustery but lovable bus driver Ralph Kramden in the seminal sitcom.</LD>
<LD>   And now, some 20 years later, Garrett, a recent Emmy winner for
his role as the hapless Robert on CBS' "Everybody Loves Raymond," is
playing the Great One in "Gleason," a CBS movie that premieres
Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm usually pretty hard on myself," says Garrett, 42, in his
dressing room at the "Raymond" set at the Warner Bros. studio. "But
people who have seen it, whether they are a fan of 'Raymond' or not,
they are relatively surprised. I play this character on 'Raymond' who
is very defined. I love playing Robert, but this is such a great
dramatic turn for me. Gleason's such a wonderful character. There are
so many levels to Jackie."</TE>
<TE>   Garrett says for some reason he always related to Gleason. "I had
a much better, healthier childhood than he did," he explains. "I came
from divorce, but my dad and mom remained very close. They were
amazingly supportive. I think the similarities are in the characters
I play. There is a lot of Gleason in Robert. He's like the Poor Soul.
And he's Ralph Kramden in a way--all of his schemes don't work out."</TE>
<TE>   Early in his stand-up career, Garrett says, "I was always compared
to him in terms of the bigger-than-life bravado. I did a lot of
characters in my act, and I did best when I worked the crowd.
Jackie's strength was working the crowd."</TE>
<TE>   However, it took a concerted effort on Garrett's part to convince
the CBS brass he was the right man for the job. And he admits he was
devastated when he learned the network had cast British actor Mark
Addy, who stars in the new CBS sitcom "Still Standing," as Gleason.</TE>
<TE>   When Addy dropped out of the project, CBS President Les Moonves
called Garrett's agent and offered him the part. "I cried like a
little schoolgirl for about an hour and a half," says Garrett.</TE>
<TE>   But then he got the script, which he says, quite bluntly, was
horrible. "It was a caricature of Gleason. They had him doing things
he would never do. I said, 'I can't do this.' "</TE>
<TE>   He was promised the script would improve, but early rewrites
weren't encouraging. Director Howard Deutch says he and Garrett
"cosmically came together. We had no choice. If we were going to do
this, we had to do it right."</TE>
<TE>   Garrett teamed with his writer friend Dave Boone, and they wrote a
script with Deutch's help. "The three of us every night we would get
together and do it," says the director. "We would hammer it out, and
it became very personal."</TE>
<TE>   And very dark. The Gleason depicted in the film is difficult and
demanding, a boozer and a philanderer who basically abandons his wife
and two young daughters.</TE>
<TE>   "Gleason was a rough guy," says Deutch. "Like all of these comics,
I have never known one who is a sweetheart all the way through. They
are usually angry, and this guy, as Brad puts it, was someone who was
bleeding badly, and in order to stop the bleeding he would do
whatever he had to, whether it be eat, drink or women."</TE>
<TE>   Because Garrett is 6 feet 8, he says they had to take care of the
"giant factor" in production. "If Ralph Kramden is holding a fist up
to his wife and says, 'Do you want to go to the moon?' and he's 2
feet taller than her, it's becomes frightening."</TE>
<TE>   So all the actors had to wear boots with 7-inch lifts. "Everyone
got them two days early to learn how to walk around," says Garrett.
"The doorways were 8 feet instead of 6 feet 9. People were on boxes;
furniture was propped up."</TE>
<TE>   Garrett admits it was surreal to play his idol. "I got a telegram
from a guy I was on the road with in 1984, when I was doing stand-up.
He said, 'You used to drive me nuts talking about playing this guy
and here you are 18 years later. Congratulations!' "</TE>
<TE>   "Gleason" will be shown Sunday at 9 p.m. on CBS. The network has
rated it TV-PGD (may not be suitable for young children, with an
advisory for suggestive dialogue).</TE>

<LD>Attention, status seekers. Now that you have settled into your
42-room dream house, filled it with museum-quality 18th century
French antiques and surrounded it with several million dollars' worth
of shrubbery, we regret to inform you that you do not live in the
manner of very important, successful people. Not unless your house
sits in its own park.</LD>
<LD>   It has come to this: The amount of floor space in a
top-of-the-heap Bel-Air mansion is roughly equivalent to that of a
supermarket.</LD>
<LD>   But as the dimensions of private homes in some parts of the city
have grown -- from 8,000 to 20,000 to 30,000 and even 40,000 square
feet -- the lots on which they sit haven't gotten any bigger. In the
flats of Beverly Hills and north of Montana Avenue in Santa Monica,
where 5,000-square-foot starter castles occupy lots meant for much
smaller homes, people can lean out their windows and chat with
neighbors, as their grandparents living in big-city tenements perhaps
did. Space, not within vast closets or indoor bowling alleys but
around sprawling houses, might be the last great luxury.</LD>
<TE>   So, what to do when your $15-million chateau feels cramped on its
two-acre lot? Buy the house next door and tear it down. Buying real
estate used to be the last refuge of the colorless and risk-averse.
As investors watch the stock market hemorrhage and solvency trumps a
sexy financial image, land again looks like a smart buy.</TE>
<TE>   Many homeowners fantasize about being able to choose their
neighbors, or keep strangers at a distance from their havens.
Increasingly, real estate agents say, those who can, do.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Michelle Pfeiffer and her writer-producer husband,
David E. Kelley, did it on a beautiful Brentwood street. Last year,
Nicolas Cage did it in Bel-Air. Melanie Griffith and Antonio Banderas
improved the view from the library of their Hancock Park hacienda by
razing the house next door.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood stars aren't the only homeowners with a sense of
manifest destiny. The former Walt Disney estate in Holmby Hills has
become the domain of a Mexican businessman, who bought the house next
door too. "It was a good financial opportunity," says the owner, who
requested anonymity. "Owning that lot improves my property." Writer
Stephen Bing, who would have been a relatively anonymous real estate
heir had he not fathered a child with Elizabeth Hurley, paid $15
million recently for neighbor Red Buttons' house in Bel-Air. Bing
will demolish it, real estate sources say, to have more land around
his home.</TE>
<TE>   Since he bought Frank Lloyd Wright's La Miniatura five years ago,
David Zander, the managing partner of a music video and commercial
production company, has worked to restore the Pasadena concrete-block
masterpiece. "I'd like to buy the house that adjoins my lawn to try
to add more privacy, more nature, more greenery," he says, "but my
neighbor has told me he intends to stay there the rest of his life,
and I don't blame him. If that lot were available, I'd be all over
it. My property borders two others as well. I'm going to do my best
to pick them all up if I can afford to."</TE>
<TE>   In the most desirable parts of Pacific Palisades, Brentwood and
Santa Monica, the price of land -- $150 per square foot -- is higher
than in Beverly Hills, where lots are typically bigger and the cost
of dirt is closer to $125 a square foot. "Everyone would like to have
more land," says Isabelle Mizrahi, a Santa Monica real estate agent.
"I'd say 10% of the people I work with ask if I'll talk to their
neighbors, to see if they'd be interested in selling."</TE>
<TE>   Price tag for privacy</TE>
<TE>   Buying the house next door is the L.A. equivalent of a
Manhattanite purchasing an adjacent apartment to expand. Yet land
offers more possibilities, both practical and psychological. It
provides room to grow, to put up a guesthouse or add a home office.
"Everyone in this area wants big, beautiful kitchens full of
professional equipment, even if all they do in them is dial for
takeout," Mizrahi says.</TE>
<TE>   More land equals greater privacy. Julia Roberts recently bought a
house in a densely populated area of Venice but gained seclusion by
buying the lot next door. Buying contiguous lots gives owners the
chance to create private compounds. The late cellist Gregor
Piatigorsky and his wife acquired three homes around their house in
Brentwood in the '50s. First, they wanted to build a tennis court.
When a neighbor complained about the court's lights, they bought his
house too. Jacqueline Piatigorsky, now in her 90s, still lives on the
property.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver have created a compound
for their family on a private street in Pacific Palisades, where they
own four houses. One has been converted into a guesthouse and gym,
and the original main house has been demolished and is being rebuilt.</TE>
<TE>   Even if an owner becomes only a temporary custodian of a house or
lot, the purchase buys power. Being able to screen potential
neighbors has great appeal to anyone who ever clashed with unpleasant
ones. "I sold a house in Pacific Palisades to a movie star who lived
on an adjacent property," says Jo Wilder, who works for Coldwell
Banker. "There was a common garden wall, and the buyer wanted to be
able to control who would move in." The cost of that privilege was
$2.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   British comedian John Cleese bought the house next to his
beachfront Montecito home, then put it on the market last spring. The
current asking price is $4.95 million. "I'm not just selling a
house," he says, "I'm buying a neighbor. I'm looking for a film
director or maybe a scriptwriter -- someone who doesn't have loud
parties."</TE>
<TE>   Maintaining one's view</TE>
<TE>   THe desire to keep a tranquil panorama pristine burns bright among
the house-proud. The owners of a cliff-side home in the Palisades
bought a house just below theirs because its pitched roof marred
their ocean view. They put a flat roof on the house, then leased it.
Before putting the house next door up for sale, a Santa Monica Canyon
dweller made a condition of purchase that no swimming pool would be
put in, and no windows could be installed on the side of the house
adjacent to hers.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. isn't the only place where a yen for perfection can increase
the cost of shelter. Texan Kit Goldsberry took some of the fortune he
made from Pace Picante Sauce and put it into a retreat nestled in a
picturesque field known as Aspen Meadows. He watched a condominium
project go up on a ridge overlooking his home. When the condos were
less than half finished, he acquired them for $20 million and leveled
them all.</TE>
<TE>   "Even people with a lot of money have to be lucky," says Crosby
Doe, of Mossler, Deasy &amp; Doe of Beverly Hills. Location may be
everything, but timing counts too.</TE>
<TE>   Suzanne and David Saperstein, who founded Metro Networks to
provide traffic reports to radio stations, built a 45,000-square-foot
limestone palace and 5,000-square-foot pool house in Holmby Hills on
six contiguous lots acquired in the '90s. But the owner of a small,
older home in the shadow of the house they named Fleur de Lys
wouldn't sell to the Houston immigrants. "I'm sure that one day Mr.
Saperstein, or whoever buys that property, will acquire the house
that's surrounded by his estate," says Loren Judd of Westside Estate
Agency in Beverly Hills. "Does he need that extra land? No. Will he
buy it if becomes available? Sure."</TE>
<TE>   In prime areas like Bel-Air, where imposing stone walls separate
the more important estates, it would seem that homeowners have enough
privacy and space without buying the house next door. But one
definition of a privileged existence is one in which one's wants
become needs. Media magnate Jerry Perenchio has been gradually adding
to the Bel-Air estate he bought in 1986 for $13.6 million. He bought
the house next door the following year for $3 million, then the house
on the other side for $3.6 million. With nearly 11 acres, he owns one
of the largest properties in Los Angeles, but he'd like to add one
more contiguous acre. It's owned, however, by Ronald and Nancy
Reagan, who aren't selling.</TE>
<TE>   The question of how much land is enough is plastic. When the
developers of Beverly Park began selling lots in the gated
subdivision above the Beverly Hills Hotel 15 years ago, the concept
was to offer lots for mega-mansions. Five acres would be enough, they
reasoned, even for a 25,000-square-foot house. Haim Saban, CEO of Fox
Family Entertainment, built a home in Beverly Park on a lot he bought
seven years ago. For a while, one lot was enough. Today, he owns two
more.</TE>
<TE>   More than just vanity</TE>
<TE>   Although it would be easy to dismiss buying an extra lot or two as
a game of one-upmanship among the wealthy, real estate agents warn
that not buying available land adjacent to a big house can be a
costly error. When the Buster Keaton estate in Beverly Hills was
owned by actor James Mason and his wife, Pamela, in the 1950s, they
sold off part of the generous driveway, and three houses were built
on it. One became available recently, but the current estate owners
didn't grab it. The Keaton mansion is again for sale, but brokers say
one reason the sellers are having difficulty making the $19.9-million
deal is that prospective buyers complain about one of the houses on
the old driveway that sits right next to the villa's front gate.</TE>
<TE>   A 35,000-square-foot main house, guesthouse, pool, spa and tennis
court in Bel-Air has been on the market for six years. The
$45-million property, built by philanthropist Iris Cantor and her
late husband, Gerald, co-founder of Cantor Fitzgerald, sits on only
1.25 acres. In today's market, a house with a more than passing
resemblance to Buckingham Palace that sits on an ordinary
suburban-sized lot is less desirable than it would be on a bigger
piece of land.</TE>
<TE>   "What makes the estates with land so valuable is they're so rare,"
says Jeff Hyland of Hilton &amp; Hyland in Beverly Hills. "There were
great estates established here in the 1920s, but after the war, when
property taxes were horrendous and it was hard to get help, owners
and their heirs began selling off property. Now, people who can
afford it are trying to bring the great estates back to what they
were."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, some buyers satisfying their land lust claim that
historic preservation is their goal. "In the 1920s, it wasn't
uncommon to find 30-, 80-, 100-acre estates," says Doe, an
architectural preservationist. "Early on, that defined the California
lifestyle. Even modest people could walk out of their homes and have
the privacy of open space. People with means will want to bring that
back. It's an attempt to regain paradise lost."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, acquiring more land can be a strike against
mansionization. Michael Sant, a Venice-based architect, designed a
house for a client with a lot in Santa Monica's Rustic Canyon. When a
contiguous lot became available, the client bought it. "We thought it
would be nice to have a good-sized piece of land with a fairly modest
building on it," says Sant, "a 4,000-square-foot house on a double
lot. The client wanted to make sure that the land and any structures
on it stayed in balance. There's always the fear of what someone
might do next door. I could design a beautiful house, and one of
these people with no sensitivity could come along and max out their
site and build something that has no sense of proportion. That kind
of thing could really ruin your day."</TE>

<HD>You've directed a movie. Now it sits on a studio shelf. And
sits.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brian Koppelman and David Levien</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"When's your movie coming out?" These five words have been thrown at
us so many times over the past 18 months that they've started to
sound more like an accusation than a question.</LD>
<LD>   We've heard them on conference calls with studio execs, at
neighborhood block parties, even in the middle of pickup basketball
games. Our dentists, whom we see only at six-month intervals, have
gotten the opportunity to ask three times. We've tried to answer
politely, to veil our own frustration, to hide the fact that for long
stretches of time we've had no idea.</LD>
<LD>   It's been worse than development hell -- when a script languishes
without being made -- because the movie is finished, waiting in the
can. We've felt as though we were serving an indeterminate prison
sentence.</LD>
<TE>   It just ended.</TE>
<TE>   "Knockaround Guys," which we wrote and directed for New Line
Cinema, was finally released Friday after being finished for about a
year and a half. So why did it take so long to come out? People want
to hear a salacious answer: that the film was horrible, way over
budget or the studio head had it in for us. In truth, the delay was
caused by a series of marketing decisions that each made sense at the
time, no matter how much pain they caused us.</TE>
<TE>   When we set out to make "Knockaround Guys," a film about the sons
of gangsters trying to make their mark, we didn't think about the way
it would be sold. Our only intention was to make a solid movie. We
worked hard to this end. We relocated from New York to Canada for
production, then to Los Angeles for post. We put in the long hours
away from our families that directing required. We waived a large
chunk of our fee so the budget stayed low. We put together a
multigenerational cast of some of our favorite actors: Barry Pepper,
Seth Green and Vin Diesel, John Malkovich and Dennis Hopper. We came
in on budget.</TE>
<TE>   When we were finished, Bob Shaye, New Line's chairman, and Mike De
Luca, then president of production, told us they liked the film. Test
audiences liked it too. They laughed in the right spots, related to
the characters, cheered at some points. The studio tentatively gave
us a February 2001 release date.</TE>
<TE>   But as that date approached, big competition landed on our
weekend, and our release was moved to September. There would be more
lead time to market the film, the studio distribution head said, and
a clearer playing field. It sounded smart, but the delay made us
nervous. Our nerves frayed further when AOL and Time Warner merged in
the middle of that summer, throwing the studio into a bit of turmoil.
Profits were down, there were personnel changes, and it was clear
that they couldn't afford any misses.</TE>
<TE>   Then in August they gave us the news that hollowed out our
stomachs: Any movies that weren't sequels or obvious commercial wins
were being delayed until after "The Lord of the Rings"--the studio's
gigantic investment--came out at the end of the year. A decision on
our film would be made then. This was a grim development. For the
past half a year we'd never considered the possibility that the movie
might not come out. We had to face it now.</TE>
<TE>   Hearing the news from New Line was one thing. But having to tell
our wives, our parents, our friends, even our agents, was far worse.
A feeling of embarrassment and failure hung over each conversation.</TE>
<TE>   The humor around the office became gallows:</TE>
<TE>   " 'Knockaround Guys,' coming soon to a Blockbuster near you."</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe we can get jobs teaching Intro to Film at Kenosha State
Teachers College?"</TE>
<TE>   "You think we could break into talk radio?"</TE>
<TE>   In December, "Lord of the Rings" exploded. The good news from New
Line in early January was that our movie would be released, with the
studio's full support. The bad news: It wouldn't be until after Vin
Diesel's "XXX" hit theaters that August. Nine more months.</TE>
<TE>   People in the business start speculating when a film sits in the
can for a long time. Production problems? Studio doubts? A certain
amount of negative buzz is inevitable, and that makes it more
challenging to position the film as new and exciting. It can taint
reviews. It can also make it difficult for the director to get his
next job.</TE>
<TE>   But a delayed release has deeper effects. The filmmaker's job
doesn't feel finished until the public can see the film for itself.
This viewing is essential to the creator's artistic growth. It is
this final element of the process that gives one distance and
objectivity -- the ability, in a sense, to move on to the next work.
And not being allowed to have it was worse than any question that
might be lobbed by an interested relative across the barbecue.</TE>
<TE>   We'd learned a lesson, though, on an earlier film -- "Rounders" --
that we've tried to remember during the past year and a half: The
little things that happen to a movie as it is getting released, and
the immediate reaction it garners, are not nearly as important in the
long run as they seem at the outset.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike "Knockaround Guys," "Rounders" was rushed to release in
1998 to capitalize on Matt Damon's newly minted fame. Along with some
glowing praise, some of its early reviews were mixed, and a few were
outright negative. Now the film has a devoted following. We get
e-mails, Web mentions and calls from people all over the place who
know the movie by heart.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the public forgets the machinations and watches the
movie.</TE>
<TE>   What's left is the film.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As well as writing, producing and directing "Knockaround Guys,"
Brian Koppelman and David Levien wrote "Rounders" and are the
producers of the November release "Interview With the Assassin."</TE>

<HD>But can he act?</HD>
<DH>Eminem goes to Hollywood in '8 Mile,' by way of the
hard-knock streets of Detroit. It's a tale of how the worlds of rap
and film accepted each other on their own terms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Geoff Boucher</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They ushered the Detroit kid into the Hollywood chamber of power and
sat him down on a crimson couch beneath perfectly framed photographs
of grinning movie stars. They told him he, too, could be a star and
waited for him to be giddy or nervous or even visibly interested.
Instead, the kid shrugged and said, "Yeah, OK."</LD>
<LD>   That was in January 2000, when Eminem was a music sensation but
not yet assured the twin titles of world's top rapper and American
pop culture's most incendiary young artist. His music and videos were
theatrical, but there was really no reason to believe he could carry
a movie. And it was arguably ludicrous to assume he could shoulder a
gritty drama written, directed and filmed by people with exactly zero
background in the rap world. Somehow, though, that is exactly what
happened.</LD>
<LD>   The bold result, a film called "8 Mile," should make Eminem a
cultural force of newfound potency and, just maybe, put him in a
place where he won't have to explain himself anymore.</LD>
<TE>   "8 Mile," which opens Nov. 8, has in Eminem a star who has been a
cannonball in the pool of pop music, hailed by some as a Lenny Bruce
of street music and reviled by others as just another rusty nail on
the cultural landscape. It also has 57-year-old director Curtis
Hanson, who was praised for the confident craft of "L.A.
Confidential" and "Wonder Boys" but came to "8 Mile" with a creeping
worry that he might be a clumsy tourist in rap. Its screenwriter,
meanwhile, is the man who co-wrote and directed the 1999 film "The
Mod Squad," a failure so bruising that, when asked what in "8 Mile"
most reflects his voice, he cited the scene where the main character
vomits backstage because he is so afraid of his audience.</TE>
<TE>   The trajectory of the "8 Mile" project was set by the fame of
Eminem, which could have sent the movie in one of two directions --
either a commercial-minded farce with a hit soundtrack or a film that
uses its built-in allure to take some chances. The course it took,
which started two years ago in the office of producer Brian Grazer,
is clearly the latter, and that makes "8 Mile" the most intriguing
music-star film in years.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember he was sitting here and he would not look at me, he
would only look straight ahead," recalls Grazer, whose movie, "A
Beautiful Mind," won the Oscar for best picture of 2001. "When you
bring people in, at least they usually look at you or at least
eventually talk. He just didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Grazer had set the meeting after catching a glimpse of Eminem on
an MTV awards show. The producer had for years been meeting rappers,
from Slick Rick to Tone Loc, looking for a star for a "meaningful"
hip-hop film, the one who could do for hip-hop youth what "Blackboard
Jungle" had done for rock 'n' roll kids and "Saturday Night Fever"
for disco kids.</TE>
<TE>   Why did Grazer think the unblinking white kid on his couch was the
one? Especially considering Eminem has been excoriated for lyrics of
venom, homophobia, violence and lewdness? "I never had any doubt,"
Grazer says. "Just seeing him on TV for six seconds I knew he could
act. And then when he came here and I was with him, I couldn't keep
my eyes off him.... And this movie is going to change the way a lot
of people look at him."</TE>
<TE>   The success of the film awaits the critics and box office, but
screenings at the Toronto International Film Festival and a Puerto
Rico convention of hip-hop DJs have created positive buzz. If it does
succeed, "8 Mile" will be an unlikely bridge between Hollywood and
Detroit that also illuminates on film how issues of race are bending
to the backbeat of hip-hop.</TE>
<TE>   Not quite a biography</TE>
<TE>   "8Mile" is not the life story of its star, but it flirts so
closely with the path of young Marshall Bruce Mathers III to his
stardom as Eminem that the movie feels like a rap remix -- tweaked
but with the same beats. The movie follows one week in the life of
Jimmy "Rabbit" Smith who, at the start of the film, is forced to move
into a trailer with his boozy mother. The film's title is the roadway
that separates that trailer in the poor, white rural community from
the poor, urban black areas where Rabbit finds the comfort of hip-hop
culture. Rabbit is an outsider on both sides of 8 Mile.</TE>
<TE>   For Hanson, the film is as much about geography as biography, a
map of Detroit's despairs. The director spent time in the city in the
1980s researching a project on child drug dealers and, when he saw
the "8 Mile" script written by Scott Silver, he remembered how young
Detroiters seemed like kids at play in a condemned factory.</TE>
<TE>   A number of top directors vied for "8 Mile," but Grazer says he
tapped Hanson because he "is an American director who can tell an
American story, and that's what this is." Hanson was blunt, though,
when he went to Detroit to meet Eminem: He would sign on if the star
committed to a serious youth film, a "Rebel Without a Cause," not a
two-hour music video.</TE>
<TE>   "That's where our bond started," Hanson recalls. "He saw that I
was going to demand of him a performance that felt sufficiently and
emotionally true to carry a movie without the crutch of the hit
tunes, a high bar for someone their first time out."</TE>
<TE>   The script had been written by Silver, who was coming off "The Mod
Squad" but was able to win over Grazer's people with a script he had
written about Richard Pryor. Once hired, Silver, who describes
himself as a 38-year-old white guy from Malibu, went out and bought
$700 in rap CDs. More educational were grainy videos of Eminem in
1990s rap "battles," the swaggering rhyme competitions that trace
back to rap's 1970s birth in New York. The battles would become the
signature scenes in "8 Mile" and make for the moments of
music-as-urban-escape that propelled "Saturday Night Fever,"
"Flashdance" and "Purple Rain."</TE>
<TE>   Silver's script was flexible as far as setting, but Hanson was
resolute that Detroit be the locale for the story and all filming. In
"Wonder Boys," Hanson used the bridges of Pittsburgh to convey the
film's life passages and in "8 Mile," he wanted Detroit to be the
harsh sidewalk that can't stifle the weeds of youth and art. To
capture the grit, the director tapped cinematographer Rodrigro
Prieto, who surveyed Mexico's mean streets in "Amores Perros," and
Philip Messina, production designer for the narcotics epic "Traffic."
He also cast locals as rappers, factory workers and even as Rabbit's
sister. The more difficult task, however, was preparing the novice
Eminem. Six weeks of rehearsal were scheduled, much of them in a
Detroit riverfront hotel with auditioning actors in an exercise to
hone the rapper's nascent craft.</TE>
<TE>   For emotional compass points, Hanson showed Eminem "Raging Bull"
and "Romper Stomper," the Australian film of violent youth, as well
as "Killer of Sheep," Charles Burnett's 1977 gem about Watts street
life. Eminem "soaked everything up like a sponge," Hanson says.</TE>
<TE>   And the sponge felt wrung out by the process. "Working with Curtis
was like going into film boot camp," Eminem says. "It was long,
grueling and difficult. But I think the end product speaks for
itself."</TE>
<TE>   If Hanson educated Eminem in film, the rapper made the director a
rap fan of nuance. "The New York way of saying 'yo' is different than
the Detroit 'yo' -- it comes in the sentence in an entirely different
place. Did you know that?" Hanson also recognized the advantage of
setting "8 Mile" in 1995 when the East Coast vs. West Coast rivalry
was still fought with words. The characters reference the rivalry in
the way rock fans used to debate Stones vs. Beatles. "There was a
sort of innocence still," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The pair huddled often to plan Rabbit's battle rhymes, and Hanson
noted Eminem's ability to consume information and return it in clever
and dizzying ways. In his downtime, the rapper hunched over a
notebook, scrawling lyrics. Hanson could hear Eminem's music seeping
through the dressing room walls as the rapper toiled on a new
recording for the final scene. The finished product, "Lose Yourself,"
is Eminem's latest radio hit.</TE>
<TE>   "Has there ever been a movie where the star wrote the song on the
set and recorded it for the movie's ending?" Hanson asks. "It's like
everything was heading toward that song, the character ends up in
that place."</TE>
<TE>   You better lose yourself in the music</TE>
<TE>   The moment you own it you better never let it go, oh</TE>
<TE>   You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow</TE>
<TE>   Cuz opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo</TE>
<TE>   -- "Lose Yourself"</TE>
<TE>   No more 'white culture'?</TE>
<TE>   The song "Lose Yourself" is pumping out of the stereo speakers on
the balcony of Jimmy Iovine's Santa Monica office as the music mogul
calls an assistant to track down "American Skin." Iovine says the new
book by Leon E. Wynter and its race analysis resonate in "8 Mile."</TE>
<TE>   "American Skin" says the nation's melting pot is now on high
simmer because of cultural forces, among them the brawn of rap in art
and commerce. The book predicts "white culture" will soon be as
meaningful to young people as a typewriter repair manual. Iovine,
co-chairman of Interscope Records -- the label for Eminem's three
albums -- and an executive producer of "8 Mile," wanted to see that
on film.</TE>
<TE>   Eminem's ascension began in earnest when an Interscope intern
handed Iovine an amateur recording of the Detroit rhymer and Iovine
passed it on to Dr. Dre. Iovine knows that this new chapter in
Eminem's career will only enhance the rapper's value to Interscope
(career artists and multimedia stars are desperately sought tonic in
the ailing music industry) but he says "8 Mile" also has cultural
insight.</TE>
<TE>   Rappers have become movie stars, but rap in film is most often a
soundtrack for urban comedy and crime. "8 Mile" seeks rap truth,
Iovine says. "The power of hip-hop is in these race changes, and you
see these changes beginning in the 1990s with the kids in this
movie," Iovine says. "It's about class, not race, and hip-hop is one
of the reasons."</TE>
<TE>   Rabbit is well aware of race and class in "8 Mile." In a clever
word concoction, Rabbit's crew is called Three-One-Third. The
reference is to Detroit's 313 area code but also to the crew's
membership: Three blacks and Rabbit, who is the one-third -- it's a
sly joke on the 19th century legal view that blacks counted as
"one-third" of a white person. In late 20th century Detroit, Rabbit
is the fraction.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole film made me strip my ego back down to the guy I was in
'95," Eminem says. "Everything from the schooling in acting to the
broke world that Jimmy lived in was strange. It brought me back to
actually feeling like the guy I was."</TE>
<TE>   When Rabbit finally wins over the black crowd at the Shelter club
battles, it's by showing that he is closer to them, in class status
and life experience, than some of the black kids under the same roof.
There is a metaphor there for Eminem's success. He is the first white
artist to become an airplay staple on urban radio with predominantly
black audiences.</TE>
<TE>   "That is what the film is about, that is what hip-hop is about,
and that is why Eminem is who and what he is today," Iovine says.
"This movie is about Detroit, but what happened there is happening
everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Detroit, warts and all</TE>
<TE>   Eminem is not Rabbit. "Rabbit shows a much more narrow range of
emotions than I do.... Jimmy seems to be a more serious, almost
depressed and volatile guy," Eminem says in an interview conducted
via e-mail. "We don't get to see Jimmy's lighter side in the film."</TE>
<TE>   That may be true, but Eminem's Detroit is the same city where
Rabbit runs, and that alone makes it unusual for Hollywood. According
to the Michigan film office, "8 Mile" appears to be the first major
Hollywood film shot entirely in Detroit. "And it captures the whole
intensity of it, the real Detroit, the burned-out Detroit, out in the
bitter cold," says Xzibit, the Detroit-born rapper who plays one of
Eminem's rhyming rivals. "It ain't pretty, but it's real."</TE>
<TE>   The realities of Detroit were apparent in the making of a scene
that has Rabbit and friends engaging in vigilante redevelopment. In
the scene, word is out that the city won't raze an abandoned house
that has been the site of a child rape, so Rabbit and his buddies
decide to torch it themselves. Upstairs, dousing drawers with gas,
Rabbit sees an old photograph of the long-gone residents, a smiling
father, mother and their kids, all in their Sunday best. He stares
with longing at the image as flames surge behind him.</TE>
<TE>   Hanson added the scene to the script when a local resident shared
the real-life account of a neighborhood arson with the same grim
motivation. City officials at first refused a permit for the filmed
arson -- their worry was that destroying an eyesore in a movie might
hurt the image of the city as opposed to, say, leaving the building
standing. "It is," Hanson says, "pretty crazy if you think about it."</TE>
<TE>   There was another lesson in the making of the scene: The film's
art department, heeding Hanson's standing orders of authenticity,
scoured Detroit flea markets and thrift stores to find a photo of a
Detroit nuclear family, from the 1970s. They could not find a single
one. The photograph in the movie was staged; it's a fake family in
vintage clothes.</TE>
<TE>   Hanson says he shares the anecdote only to outline the challenges
facing young people in Detroit and lack of "traditional signposts for
many of them, things such as church and family." He left the city,
though, inspired by the people he met and with a deep affection for
them. "8 Mile," he says, "is a valentine to the people there."</TE>
<TE>   There are plenty of return valentines for Eminem on both sides of
8 Mile Road these days and he still lives in the city. Crowds often
mobbed him during the filming. That's a far cry from the outsider
Marshall Mathers. "8 Mile" hopes to take filmgoers on that same
journey of understanding, but Iovine reminds again that Rabbit and
Eminem are not the same person. The main difference? The music
executive answers immediately: "Thirty million albums, worldwide."</TE>

Curtis Hanson, on the "8 Mile" set in the rapper's hometown of
Detroit, where the two first met. "That's where our bond started,"
Hanson says. "He saw that I was going to demand of him a performance
that felt sufficiently and emotionally true to carry a movie without
the crutch of the tunes, a high bar for someone their first time
out."</CP>

<HD>Blowing L.A.'s cover</HD>
<DH>Three new cop shows have been chasing after unusual
locations and angles to portray the city in new ways.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Greg Braxton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A group of SWAT officers swarms before a run-down house on 36th
Street in southwestern Los Angeles. Yet the residents on the street
barely blink an eye.</LD>
<LD>   No wonder. This is L.A., after all, and the most anxious people on
the scene aren't the cops, but the young men and women carrying
walkie-talkies and dressed in Hollywood casual attire.</LD>
<LD>   Since the city's canyons and brushlands figured prominently in
early westerns and since Laurel and Hardy fruitlessly tried to move a
piano up a steep staircase in Silver Lake, Los Angeles has served as
a backdrop for film, and then television.</LD>
<TE>   This season, however, the old perennial locations just don't cut
it. The premiere this fall of three new cop shows all set on the
streets of L.A. -- "Robbery Homicide Division" on CBS, "Boomtown" on
NBC and "Fastlane" on Fox -- has prompted a high-stakes scramble to
capture unfamiliar views of one of the most filmed cities anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   The three productions are practically falling over each other on
city streets, filming within blocks and hours of each other in the
search for unique sites that have previously escaped Hollywood's
attention.</TE>
<TE>   Residents in poorer areas of East and South-Central Los Angeles
may complain occasionally about police inattention, but the TV cops
are there in force. The other actors, directors and crews that
accompany them are mixing with the homeless denizens of skid row,
turning their bright lights on the almost invisible garment
manufacturers underneath the Santa Monica Freeway, and zeroing in on
the artist community of Leimert Park. Seedy streets populated by gang
members and vagrants also have been overrun by film crews and star
trailers.</TE>
<TE>   Even a familiar filming location like the Los Angeles River is
getting viewed in a different, decidedly less romanticized light.
Don't look for John Travolta drag-racing in "Grease"; the nooks and
crannies of the ditch and its unseen populace living in caves and
holes around its concrete banks have been invaded by "Boomtown."</TE>
<TE>   The dreadlocked owner of a reggae music store on Crenshaw
Boulevard has reluctantly allowed crews to film in his shop. One
producer bragged about filming a scene high in an abandoned wing of
City Hall that had never been filmed before.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been shooting L.A. for 20 years, trying to make it not seem
like Los Angeles," says Flip Wylly, a location manager for "Robbery
Homicide Division." "Now, we're going out of our way to show the
bittersweet beauty of Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Or, in the case of this night's shoot on 36th Street, the aim is
to satisfy producer-director Michael Mann's quest for realism, using
real SWAT personnel. And as sirens wail nearby and police helicopters
occasionally pass overhead, the glamorous Hollywood machinery comes
nose-to-nose with the often grimy reality of city life.</TE>
<TE>   "L.A. is a fascinating and unique three-dimensional city," Mann
says as he sits in his trailer. "There's this fusion of cultures that
you don't have in other places. We're trying to approach L.A. as
realistically as we can. Everything is loaded with color here, but
there's this patina of corrosion on top of it all."</TE>
<TE>   Mann, who created the pastel look for TV's "Miami Vice" and who
directed "Heat," a feature film that showed L.A. in a stylized light,
is aiming for a grittier feel with "Robbery Homicide Division."
Although many of the city's picturesque vistas are shown, the
production also is centered in lower-class communities. That's posed
some problems: Gang members have threatened crew members in some
areas, and equipment has been stolen. Yet there's a creative payoff:
Mann is overseeing some filming in the middle of the night to capture
a more ominous feel, instead of shooting in early evening.</TE>
<TE>   In NBC's "Boomtown," each week's crime is examined
"Rashomon"-style, from the viewpoints of cops, district attorneys,
paramedics and journalists. They bring their distinct perspectives,
filtered through their experiences in such a diverse city.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been told I have this romanticized view of Los Angeles,"
says Graham Yost, creator of "Boomtown." As a screenwriter, he
previously offered a street-level perspective on L.A. -- notably the
then-incomplete 105 Freeway -- in his breakthrough project, "Speed."</TE>
<TE>   "I love all the odd stuff about the city, the juxtapositions,"
says Yost, a Canadian by birth. "I remember years ago when I was here
with my girlfriend, who is now my wife, and I was looking up at this
palm tree that was blowing in the breeze and I thought it was the
greatest thing. Then my girlfriend pointed to this other palm tree,
and said, 'Notice how that one is not moving?' I said yes, and she
said, 'That's because there's rats up in there.' And that really
summed up L.A. for me, the whole irony of it."</TE>
<TE>   New angles, reliable favorites</TE>
<TE>   "Fastlane" is a flashier, more neon-flavored valentine to L.A.'s
fast life. The series prominently showcases sandy beaches, large
hillside homes and hipper-than-hip nightclubs where the two
protagonists, undercover cops Van Ray (portrayed by Peter Facinelli)
and Deaqon Hayes (Bill Bellamy), investigate cases.</TE>
<TE>   Says executive producer John McNamara: "This show was always
conceived as a love letter to L.A. Before, there wasn't really a show
that showed the city for what it is. For all its problems and
annoyances, it still has the surf culture, the great clubs, all the
multiethnic culture. Our show is all about heightened realism. No
other show has been this way about Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   The high profile of the city in these new shows -- not to mention
returning shows such as "24," "Alias" and "The Shield" -- is
something of a mixed blessing for local boosters.</TE>
<TE>   "When tourists come here, one of the first things they want to do
is see the beaches where 'Baywatch' was filmed. Now it's being used
as the central focus of crime shows. We would prefer these series not
show all this crime," said Carol Martinez, associate vice president
of the Los Angeles Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau. "But it's still a
great commercial for Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Out on the streets, meanwhile, the race is on to find that rare
L.A. setting that hasn't been overexposed on film or TV.</TE>
<TE>   "Robbery Homicide Division" scores a coup when it takes over, for
a brief scene, a Jamaican record store on a strip of Crenshaw Avenue
dominated by barbershops and hair salons. The store, owned by a man
who identifies himself only as Natty Bob, is cluttered with posters
and CDs of Bob Marley and other reggae artists. In the scene, Tom
Sizemore questions a suspected criminal selling marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want them to film anything negative here -- no hard
drugs," says Natty Bob, who wears a knit hat over his dreads. "I hope
they show me the show before it airs."</TE>
<TE>   While the search is on for fresh locations, an old perennial, skid
row, is enjoying a brisk business from the new shows. "Boomtown"
recently took over a Mexican restaurant on 7th Street in an area
shared by vagrants and large industrial complexes. On the evening of
the shoot, car traffic is sparse. But the sidewalks are alive.</TE>
<TE>   A bearded man in torn rags finds a resting place in a doorway. Two
youths swear at each other as they hurriedly move toward train
tracks.</TE>
<TE>   Donnie Wahlberg and Mykelti Williamson, two of the stars of
"Boomtown," look briefly at a woman with dirty rags covering her head
as she maneuvers a shopping cart filled with cans and debris over a
multitude of wires and moves around the mass of chairs, lights,
technicians and extras in front of the run-down Terminal Hotel. The
actors, who play detectives on the drama, then go back to talking
with crew members as they wait for their cue.</TE>
<TE>   A few doors down, dozens of members of the "Boomtown" production
staff are crammed into the El Troquero cafe, which is being used as
the scene of a Russian mafia hit. A large man with fake blood on his
shirt lies on the floor. Plates of uneaten steaks and sausages are
scattered on tables and counters.</TE>
<TE>   Yost, one of the show's executive producers, surveys the scene,
then dashes back outside to the relative coolness. He is pleased with
the scene and location. He darts across the street to his trailer,
situated in front of a warehouse loading dock.</TE>
<TE>   When Yost first pitched the series more than a year ago, he
thought it would be the only new show set in Los Angeles. "Then I
found out all these other shows were coming," he says. "We were ahead
of the curve, I guess. But we'll still find cool places, and they'll
find cool places."</TE>
<TE>   One of L.A.'s most ironic features has gotten star treatment in
"Boomtown" -- the Los Angeles River. It was featured in the drama's
pilot; one character stands above it and says: "London has the
Thames. Paris has the Seine. Vienna has the blue Danube. Los Angeles
has a concrete drainage ditch. But it's all we've got. It will have
to do."</TE>
<TE>   Says Yost, "On one hand, it's a real cool place. But on the other
hand, it's got the most vile water around."</TE>
<TE>   Williamson, who plays Det. "Fearless" Bobby Smith, says he felt a
sense of fear when wandering around the river to get the feel of it
before filming. "It's not the kind of place a person would or should
visit under normal circumstances. It's the underbelly of L.A. People
live there, in the concrete. When I was there, I could feel all these
eyes watching me. I quickly got back in my car. That place is no
joke."</TE>
<TE>   The following day, the "Fastlane" crew sets up nearby in an
industrial area, around a street dock of battered-looking sweatshops
and garment manufacturers underneath the Santa Monica Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic in the alley repeatedly comes to a halt as clothing trucks
try to maneuver past vans and cars bring cast and crew members to the
temporary set in an adjacent vacant lot.</TE>
<TE>   Facinelli and Bellamy, the stars of "Fastlane," walk around the
alley and surroundings with their shirts off, talking with production
members as employees of the industrial shops look on.</TE>
<TE>   "We're showing every side of L.A.," Bellamy says. "But what we
want people to see most are the slick sunsets and the beautiful
people. We want viewers to really want to come here."</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, let 'The Shield' show all the dirty stuff," Facinelli
chimes in. "You won't see any litter on our show."</TE>
<TE>   The location shooting on streets such as Sunset Boulevard and
watering holes such as the Chateau Marmont has made the "Fastlane"
production more costly, but McNamara says it's essential to capturing
the flavor of the city. "It's how we show the fun," he says. "You
just can't get that on a soundstage."</TE>
<TE>   And so far, he says, "Fastlane" is managing to avoid its
competitors out on those mean streets.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill Bellamy and Tom Sizemore haven't faced off yet," he says.
"Still, I wouldn't be surprised if that does go down one day."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>The boy with the world on a string</HD>
<DH>Italians grow up with the story of 'Pinocchio.' So the
mania surrounding a new Roberto Benigni film version is only natural.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Henderson</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>Collodi, Italy</DL>
<LD>In a country where a wooden puppet is a national icon and a former
comic is a national hero, the upcoming live-action movie version of
"Pinocchio" starring Roberto Benigni represents a historic
opportunity.</LD>
<LD>   Now is the time to take back moral ownership of the puppet, who is
considered, along with Julius Caesar and Michelangelo, one of the
country's most influential national figures. Italians hope the film
clarifies a mistake Americans often make: Pinocchio wasn't born in
Walt Disney's studio. Pinocchio is Italian.</LD>
<LD>   Benigni's "Pinocchio," which opened Friday in 860 theaters, a
record in Italy for any movie regardless of national origin, is
already the biggest production in Italian history. With a budget of
$45 million, the Miramax project is the most expensive Italian movie
ever made. Movie insiders here predict it will sweep past "Life Is
Beautiful," Benigni's Oscar-winning hit from 1999, which has earned
$229 million worldwide. The movie opens in the U.S. on Christmas Day.</LD>
<TE>   Here, the movie has sparked an American-style merchandising binge.
Pinocchio backpacks and hand organs share shelf space with Pinocchio
yo-yos, gum machines, Etch-a-Sketches, key chains, bookends, towel
holders, tops, puzzles, diaries, cassettes, 16 Pinocchio books and
every size of Pinocchio imaginable. A life-size, hand-carved,
stained-wood Pinocchio goes for about $150.</TE>
<TE>   At Cantina del Torchio Antico, a popular restaurant here, you can
buy Pinocchio olive oil (taste at your own risk), grappa (with
Pinocchio on the label looking a little more wobbly than usual) and
white wine (imagine a mid-range Chardonnay).</TE>
<TE>   The beaming mug of Benigni, attired in Pinocchio's goofy white and
orange flowered outfit, prances across billboards all over Rome and
is on the cover of half a dozen Italian magazines.</TE>
<TE>   Pinocchio, the mischievous boy created by Gepetto whose penchant
for lying gives him a very long nose, isn't merely Italian, though.
He's Tuscan. His roots are here in Collodi, population 2,000, a town
that curls around a hill in the western stretches of the region.
About 40 miles west of Florence, Collodi doesn't feature the rolling
green hills of the spectacular Tuscan countryside. By Tuscan
standards, Collodi isn't all that attractive.</TE>
<TE>   But it was on a hill above the town's medieval center that Carlo
Lorenzini sat down in 1883 and wrote a book that eventually would be
translated into 250 languages. Only the Koran and the Bible have
appeared in more.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Florence, Lorenzini changed his name to Carlo Collodi
after moving to his mother's hometown to write the book.</TE>
<TE>   "This movie will be a good opportunity to clarify that 'Pinocchio'
is an Italian story," said Pier Francesco Bernacci, director of the
Carlo Collodi National Foundation. "Americans will know the real
Pinocchio."</TE>
<TE>   To understand Italy's excitement over this movie, one must
understand Italy's love for Pinocchio.</TE>
<TE>   For generations, Italians have viewed the book as the national
primer for teaching right from wrong. For more than 100 years, it has
been read at Italian bedsides from Sicily to the Dolomites. Benigni
told the Italian media that his mother read it to him when he was a
little boy. Italian historians credit the book for unifying Italy's
fragmented dialects into a single national language after the
republic was formed in 1870. Today, it is still mandatory reading in
many middle school curriculums. Italian feminist Vittoria Haziel
recently released a feminist reinterpretation of the story titled
"Pinocchia." The Italian government is considering making Pinocchio
its official symbol abroad.</TE>
<TE>   "Pinocchio for Italy is our main story," Bernacci said. "But he's
not only a Collodi story or a Tuscan story but every part of the
world. He could be an American story. When you read the story, you
don't read of Italian places or Tuscan places. You read places that
could be anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Bernacci, dressed in a stylish blue suit on a Sunday afternoon,
sat in his second-floor office with Pinocchio artwork all over his
walls and adjacent rooms. His foundation promotes Collodi and
Pinocchio worldwide. This month, new Pinocchio paintings and
sculptures will tour Paris, New York, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and
Buenos Aires.</TE>
<TE>   A three-day international education festival was recently held at
Parco di Pinocchio, Collodi's 40-year-old theme park, which attracts
more than 200,000 visitors a year and will be expanded with Amici di
Pinocchio (Friends of Pinocchio) by the year 2005. Parco di Pinocchio
is full of kid rides, bronze sculptures of "Pinocchio" characters and
puppet shows.</TE>
<TE>   It's not exactly Disneyland, but Italians don't like their
Pinocchio associated with the Disney film that has earned more than
$400 million from theatrical release and video sales since it
premiered in 1940.</TE>
<TE>   "Pinocchio looks like an Italian," said Deanna Mencarini, a
Collodi native who runs a souvenir stand featuring everything from
Pinocchio bubble soap to aprons. "He makes a lot of trouble, and he
could be an adult or a child."</TE>
<TE>   That's why no one in Italy can find a more perfect actor for the
role than Benigni, who Mencarini says "is a little crazy, like
Pinocchio." Of course, this "Pinocchio" interpretation will be a bit
different from the 1972 version featuring Gina Lollobrigida. It has
Benigni all over it. He's the star, writer and director of a story
that has tugged at his Tuscan roots since he was a child.</TE>
<TE>   Forever a headstrong boy</TE>
<TE>   Benigni grew up poor like Pinocchio, and as a comic Benigni became
just as mischievous. When his highflying, furniture-hopping,
tuxedo-bursting acceptance speech at the Academy Awards for best
actor landed him in Oscar lore, Pinocchio may as well have been his
speechwriter. Legendary Italian director Federico Fellini, who died
in 1993, talked to Benigni about doing the film together, and,
Benigni says, on his deathbed told him, "You will do Pinocchio."</TE>
<TE>   Produced by his wife and co-star, Nicoletta Braschi, "Pinocchio"
spent eight months in pre-production, while 1,000 pairs of shoes, 477
toys for the Land of Toys and 20 costumes for Benigni were made.
Every costume and dish is handmade. The film was shot over seven
months in near secrecy in a former chemical plant in Umbria using
4,000 extras.</TE>
<TE>   Benigni wanted it nothing like the Disney cartoon. Pinocchio is
still a mischievous talking puppet created by Gepetto whose nose
grows every time he tells one of his many lies. There is a talking
cricket, but his name isn't Jiminy. Pinocchio tries to be good but
falls in with other troublemaker companions, and there is even some
violence. However, there is a surprise ending.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a truly disobedient film," Benigni says. "It just didn't
want to obey, like Pinocchio. And like Pinocchio, it has a huge
heart."</TE>

<HD>Americans and cars: Love runs out of gas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dave Hickey</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times /  Dave Hickey is a writer of
fiction and cultural criticism who lives in Las Vegas.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>FOR MOST OF THE 20TH CENTURY, a generous portion of what was best
about America and Americans was inextricably entangled in our special
relationship with the automobile. The innocence and ebullience of
that relationship made us seem more human, its ubiquity made us seem
more democratic, and its purity made us seem more civilized. No more.
When no less an authority than William Clay Ford Jr., chief executive
of the Ford Motor Co. and great-grandson of the man himself,
announces that the romance between Americans and their cars has gone
stale, the bloom may be said to be officially off the rose.</LD>
<LD>   The word is out. Americans used to love their cars and now they
don't, or at least not the way they did. The fate of the republic, of
course, can hardly be said to hang on the outcome of this souring
romance, but the tone and temper of the republic almost certainly do.
A seismic shift of affection has taken place, and there is no
consensus on its causes and consequences.</LD>
<TE>   The French cultural psychologist Dr. G. Clotaire Rapaille, who had
a hand in designing Chrysler's PT Cruiser, thinks the fault lies in
our cars. Like the designing French shrink he is, Rapaille believes
that the possibility of romance springs eternal, that we might love
again if American carmakers would just design a car or two that we
might fall for. I don't think so. My own suspicion is that the fault
lies not in our cars but in ourselves -- that, simply put, Americans
are no longer a loving people.</TE>
<TE>   Many years ago, Mary McCarthy proposed another option. In an essay
called "The Humanist in the Bathtub," McCarthy argues that Americans,
afflicted by their Puritan heritage and alienated from the pagan
roots of European civilization, have never had any live, sensual
affection for objects. We surround ourselves with objects, to be
sure, but in McCarthy's view, we don't care about their object-hood.
We care about what these objects mean, to ourselves and to others.</TE>
<TE>   So, maybe we never loved cars at all. Maybe we only loved what
cars meant, and we no longer do. Or maybe cars mean something
different these days -- and love has nothing to do with it. The facts
support this supposition. Car sales are burgeoning, yet we know the
thrill is gone. All over America, every weekend, thousands of
automotive extravaganzas open to the public: antique car shows, hot
rod shows, custom car shows, grand prix races, NASCAR races, drag
races, Indy races, motocross rallies, monster truck challenges,
tractor pulls and demolition derbies.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it's not the same. What used to be a wide-screen romance is
now just a sitcom dalliance. The vehicles that once brought us
together in a colloquy of enthusiasm and aspiration now set us apart
from one another. They isolate us behind steel doors and tinted
windows; they re-tribalize us in the pursuit of regional enthusiasms;
they reassert class distinctions and wedge us into niche markets that
exploit our fear and prejudice.</TE>
<TE>   Museum as showroom</TE>
<TE>   THE MUSEUM OF MODERN Art's inaugural exhibition in Queens provided
a case in point. For that occasion, the museum presented the six
automobiles in its permanent collection spotlighted on white
pedestals in a kind of celestial showroom. Since MoMA's new Queens
location resembles nothing so much as an idealized car dealership,
the effect was uncannily appropriate, lacking only symbolic sales
personnel, cruising like sharks.</TE>
<TE>   In lieu of these, the walls of MoMA's showroom were adorned with
period advertising graphics. One of these encouraged us to "Watch the
Fords Go By," although one would have had to step outside to do this
since nothing so mundane as a Ford adorned the showroom floor.</TE>
<TE>   This space was elegantly populated by the usual suspects of late
20th century European automotive design: a 1946-48 Pininfarina
Cisitalia "202," a 1959 Volkswagen Beetle, a 1963 Jaguar E-type
roadster, a 1990 Ferrari Formula One racing car and a 2002 Smart Car
manufactured by Micro Compact Car in Germany and France.</TE>
<TE>   This, evidently, is the Museum of Modern Art's automotive
universe: two extravagant vehicles for the European aristocracy, two
modest vehicles for the international proletariat and two functional
vehicles, one for racing and one for fighting wars. This last
category was represented by the single American car in the
exhibition, a 1954 Willys-Overland jeep, which was acquired, one
presumes, to honor the jeep's role in liberating Europe during World
War II, thus enabling the masters of European design to proceed at
their leisure.</TE>
<TE>   Missing from the Modern's showroom were any of the cars we loved
as one loves works of art or any vehicle at all that might have been
paid out on time by a member of the American middle class and parked
in the driveway of a mortgaged home.</TE>
<TE>   One can't really complain about this, however. Without its
penchant for European solutions and class distinctions, without its
obsessive concern with distinguishing "art" from "design," the museum
just wouldn't be the Modern.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, one has a right to wonder why a major American cultural
institution would devote an enormous room, in its new building, in
its inaugural exhibition, to a selection of automobiles that, with
the exception of the race car, might be found on any given afternoon
parked outside a Starbucks in Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   The cynical suggestion that the Modern has embarked upon a
flirtation with democracy by pandering to the automotive enthusiasms
of its new off-island neighbors doesn't wash. One doesn't pander with
Cisitalias and E-type roadsters, and the connoisseurs perusing these
exquisite machines had not just come from a monster truck rally. They
were on their way to Palm Springs, where they wanted to feel safe and
knowledgeable in their summer-weight jackets and chat about "design."</TE>
<TE>   Symbols of freedom</TE>
<TE>   CONFRONTED WITH THIS tasting menu of class-conscious automotive
cuisine, however, it's easy to forget that for most of the previous
century, automobiles were the primary icons of egalitarian freedom in
this, the Land of the Free.</TE>
<TE>   Automobiles meant freedom then, and if they did not actually set
us free, they endowed us with mobility, which at the time was
considered to be the closest thing to it. Automobiles made America
smaller, its distances shorter, and they made it one nation perhaps
for the first time. As the nation's first standardized, absolutely
ubiquitous, sea-to-shining-sea, mass-produced product, the Ford Motor
Car inaugurated what Andy Warhol used to call "the democracy of
objects" -- a society in which all the people can be different
because all the objects are the same.</TE>
<TE>   In his book "The Americans," Daniel Boorstin offers a parable of
creation for such a democracy. He asks us to imagine the population
of a new town on the American plains in the early days of the last
century. No one living on that bald ridge of prairie was born there;
they have all come from everywhere for every reason and are bound for
God knows where. They share no cultural heritage, no ethnic bonds, no
regional or religious traditions; they are bound by no shared past or
imagined future. So, Boorstin asks, what do they talk about?</TE>
<TE>   His answer: They talk about their Fords, and in these
conversations, those uniformly black, mass-produced originals
function simultaneously as objects of possession, indispensable
appliances, icons of community and emblems of the promise of the
republic. Citizens who share nothing else may stand side by side in
the middle of nowhere looking at a Ford and negotiate issues of
virtue and value, art and design, maintenance and survival,
practicality and aspiration -- then move a thousand miles away and do
it again.</TE>
<TE>   Before the end of World War II, the richness and complexity of
this conversation were rarely, if ever, reflected in the automobiles,
however. Makes and models proliferated throughout the period, but
mass-produced cars continued to present themselves as Henry Ford
intended them to, as practical tools to facilitate and enhance the
conduct of commercial society. The jeep in the Modern's collection is
the ultimate expression of this sensibility: an armored, hopped-up,
virtually indestructible Model A.</TE>
<TE>   In the festival of commerce that followed World War II, American
cars finally embraced the destiny of their iconic social status.
Under the aegis of design maestros such as Harley Earl and Raymond
Loewy, cars became what they stood for. The highways filled with
rainbow-hued, chrome-and-steel objects of desire -- as beautiful and
foolish as love itself, as powerful and dangerous as their drivers
were presumed to be brave, as theatrical and impractical as human
aspiration, as wasteful as talent and as improbable as optimism.</TE>
<TE>   It goes without saying, of course, that by the standards of the
Museum of Modern Art these cars were not well designed. Their form
did not follow elegantly from their practical function, but neither
does the form of a painting by Picasso or Roy Lichtenstein follow
elegantly, and these cars, like those paintings, were designed less
to do something than to be something -- to embody their social
function.</TE>
<TE>   So the Thunderbird and the Rocket 88 looked fast even when they
were standing still because their drivers' destination was no place
on a map. It was a visible, aesthetic condition of absolute,
democratic social mobility, of unconditional promise, and when these
monsters roamed the Earth, literally thousands of soon-to-be artists,
designers, writers, filmmakers and musicians looked at these cars,
drove them, dreamed about them and learned from them something about
what it means to be an artist in a democracy.</TE>
<TE>   End of an era</TE>
<TE>   THEN, AS SUDDENLY AS THEY came, the wonderful cars were gone. The
whole idea of wonderful cars was suddenly absurd and, around 1972,
American automotive design passed directly from adolescence into
senescence, with no intervening summer of maturity. Almost overnight,
American cars became safe, economical, ugly and virtually identical,
and, of these four horsemen, only the steeds bearing safety and
economy were explicable.</TE>
<TE>   There were reasons: The carnage in Vietnam and carnage on the
highways, the degradation of the environment and the oil crises in
the Middle East all conspired to transform the simple virtues of
safety and economy into cardinal ones. Foreign competition made them
necessary, and technology made them possible, so safe and economical
we got.</TE>
<TE>   Ugly and identical are harder to parse, however, since safety and
economy do not require beige. Only the desire to be visibly and
theatrically cautious, economical and anonymous explains this flight
into automotive purdah. And this desire for timorous, self-effacing
penance, I think, can only be attributed to a massive recrudescence
of Puritan guilt and wincing embarrassment over the infamy of
Vietnam, the obliquity of Richard Nixon and all the fun we had in the
'50s and '60s.</TE>
<TE>   As improbable as it might seem, however, there is a cultural logic
to this paradigm shift. A society in quest of an "Eldorado" is
transformed in the blink of an eye into a society in search of a
domestic "Accord," but it's still the same society and the same old
theater of democratic public life, only now with a brand-new,
incredibly boring, Victorian play.</TE>
<TE>   Viewed as theater, then, the third act of this drama qualifies as
theater of the absurd. The age of extravagant adventure is supplanted
in the '70s by an age of nervous consolidation, and supplanted in the
'90s by an age of imperial paranoia. With the ascendancy of the
suburban utility vehicle and the off-road raider we finally achieve
the absolute worst of both worlds: a virtually infinite selection of
dangerous, uneconomical, ugly, identical vehicles -- of feral jeeps
and walled-communities-on-wheels.</TE>
<TE>   On the highway, we confront senile dread, sequestered and smoothly
cruising along. Off road we breathe the dust and stinking fumes of
petulant adolescence raging against the planet without joy or
optimism. Given these circumstances, William Clay Ford Jr. has a
right to his lament that we used to write songs about cars, about
T-Birds and GTOs, and now we write regulations.</TE>
<TE>   Well, quelle surprise, I say. We write songs about things we love.
We regulate things we fear, and today we are afraid of just about
everything. We are afraid of what our cars might do to us and of what
people might do to our cars. We are afraid of what our cars might do
to the world, and mostly we are afraid of the world -- of that
actual, non-virtual domain into which the automobile propels us so
effortlessly and propelled us once with much panache.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the acrid scent of apocalypse hovers around our car-buying
habits. Why else would we require tanks to take the kids to soccer
practice? Why would we purchase off-road vehicles with no intention
of leaving the road if some covert agency of our reptilian subcortex
were not planning against the day when the 405 falls into ultimate,
irremediable disrepair? Who knows?</TE>
<TE>   All I know is that the spectacle of cringing privilege is not a
pretty one, so I'd like to think we are only buying what we are being
sold, that the nation's slide into mobile philistinism is simply the
product of cost-effective marketing. Car manufacturers who once sold
optimism and courage now sell pessimism and cowardice. This has to be
cheaper, since pessimism and cowardice are supposed to be ugly.</TE>
<TE>   Still, how long can the boy cry wolf? Ugly gets boring, and
pessimism is no more predictive of the apocalypse than optimism is of
utopia. And optimism, at least, has the virtue of being its own
reward. It makes the day more livable. It transforms the ominous
specter of tomorrow into the promise of adventure, and if the elegant
rake of the candy-apple Vicky that once crouched out in the driveway
said anything to the world, it said this: We are up for adventure.</TE>

<HD>A big piece of his heart</HD>
<DH>Doug Morris doesn't much care if his CD tribute to Bert
Berns sells or not. He just wants to see the writer of such hits as
'Twist and Shout' get his due.</DH>

<LD>As the head of the world's largest record company, Universal Music
Group Chairman Doug Morris could spend all morning hobnobbing with
the power-breakfast crowd at the Peninsula Hotel. Here comes Dave
Glew now, Epic Records Group chairman and Morris' old friend. "Dave,
you're looking great. Everything OK?"</LD>
<LD>   Morris, in town from New York for the week, could be talking about
his latest successes: the mounting sales of the Eminem album or the
critical back flips over the new Beck CD. Both were released by
Morris' network of labels, which stretches from Interscope to
Island/Def Jam and generates nearly a third of the nation's album
sales.</LD>
<LD>   But the soft-spoken chief executive, casual in a dark suit with
open-collar shirt and a two-day stubble, has another topic on his
mind this weekday morning, and he's so absorbed in it that he hasn't
touched his cantaloupe slices for half an hour.</LD>
<TE>   Morris, 63, is talking about a new album that he calls his "baby."
It contains 10 tracks written and/or produced by the late Bert Berns,
who was an inspiration when Morris was an aspiring songwriter in New
York four decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   "In this business, you put out records all the time by artists you
love and that you hope will sell a lot, but this is probably the
first time I've ever been involved in a record that I don't care if
it sells," Morris says. "It's my way of paying Bert back for all he
gave me. I hope this illuminates his career, that people will
understand who he was. Everybody knows his music, but they don't know
him."</TE>
<TE>   And everyone does know Berns' music, starting with his most famous
composition, "Twist and Shout."</TE>
<TE>   Was there ever a more effortless hit? From the opening line,
"Shake it up baby now," to its seductive mix of R&amp;B and Latin
rhythms, "Twist and Shout" is an irresistible piece of rock 'n' roll
and a staple at wedding receptions, frat parties and oldies stations.</TE>
<TE>   Because the lively tune was a hit for the Beatles, most pop fans
probably assume Lennon and McCartney wrote it. More sophisticated
listeners who know that the song was earlier recorded by the Isley
Brothers may attribute it to that group. But it was Berns (under the
name Bert Russell) who co-wrote the song with Phil Medley.</TE>
<TE>   That tune is one of the best-known products of a hit machine that
roared triumphantly from the start of the 1960s until the charismatic
New Yorker died of a heart attack at age 38 in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   Van Morrison may have sung the taut "Here Comes the Night" with
his group Them, but Berns wrote the song and produced the recording.
Janis Joplin's signature hit, the pleading "Piece of My Heart," was
written by Berns and Jerry Ragovoy.</TE>
<TE>   Berns was also responsible for such pop or R&amp;B hits as the McCoys'
"Hang On Sloopy" (co-written by Wes Farrell), Freddie Scott's "Are
You Lonely for Me, Baby?," Solomon Burke's "Cry to Me" and the
Exciters' "Tell Him." His production credits also included such
memorable hits as the Drifters' "Under the Boardwalk" and Van
Morrison's "Brown Eyed Girl."</TE>
<TE>   The music in "The Heart and Soul of Bert Berns" is
extraordinary--a virtual nomination speech calling for the late
songwriter-producer's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
in the "nonperforming" category that already includes many of his
peers, including Phil Spector, Jerry Wexler and the team of Jerry
Leiber &amp; Mike Stoller.</TE>
<TE>   Many of these tracks were hits in their day, but some are
relatively obscure now, and they are so striking you may find
yourself listening to them over and over, marveling at their
construction.</TE>
<TE>   The most impressive thing about the recordings is the masterful
way Berns shifted emotional tones. Most of the songs are grand tales
of romantic desperation featuring an instrumental tension that builds
slowly with defiant horns and insistent drums, then gives way to
explosive vocal release. There are lots of references to lonely
rooms, tears and regret.</TE>
<TE>   "Are You Lonely for Me, Baby?" opens with female voices taunting a
wayward lover with the title phrase. They're answered by Freddie
Scott's chilling surrender: "Yes, I am."</TE>
<TE>   Too little time for it all</TE>
<TE>   Berns, an intense, darkly handsome man, had a wide array of
influences, and he brought them all into play in his music. He
studied classical music as a youngster and fell in love with Cuban
music while working at clubs in Havana. That sound would color many
of his recordings. In "Twist and Shout," for instance, you can hear
the chord sequence of the Cuban folk song "Guantanamera."</TE>
<TE>   Morris describes Berns as a tough street kid from the Bronx who
was obsessive about his career because he suffered from rheumatic
fever and didn't feel he had long to live. In the liner notes for the
album, Morris adds, "He was the most charismatic man I had ever met.
Bert was just cool. Played his guitar. Bit his nails. Talked
excitedly. Tight with a buck. I remember he went over to England. He
was worried people would forget him while he was away. He stayed in
England for, maybe, three weeks. And while he was there, he worked
with Van Morrison, Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones."</TE>
<TE>   As you listen to Morris, it's clear that the new CD, which was
released Oct. 1, isn't just a tribute to Berns. For those who think
all top-level record executives are "suits" interested only in
bottom-line profits, Morris' devotion to Berns is a tribute to the
best impulses of the music industry.</TE>
<TE>   Long before he began climbing the executive ladder that led him to
his current post, Morris fell under Berns' spell. His own songwriting
credits include the Chiffons' 1966 hit "Sweet Talkin' Guy."</TE>
<TE>   "I was this square kid from Long Island, and Bert was this hipster
who was always out on the town," Morris says with a soft smile,
recalling the days in the early '60s when they worked for publisher
Robert Mellin. "I used to love watching him in this funky old office,
sitting on a couch with the springs coming out and writing songs on a
guitar.</TE>
<TE>   "The next day he'd bring these incredible singers into the studio
and they'd hit these fabulous notes that brought the songs to life.
The next thing I was hearing the songs on the radio. He was warm,
genuine, encouraging and terribly driven."</TE>
<TE>   No one is more thrilled about Morris' decision to salute Bert
Berns than Berns' children.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't hug him tight enough for what he has done," says
Cassandra Berns, sitting in a crowded Santa Monica bungalow that
houses Sloopy II, the family publishing company. Now 35, she was 10
months old when her father died. Her brother Brett was coming up on
his third birthday, while the third child, Russell, was 2 weeks old.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, a lot of my father's songs were autobiographical, about
pain and love lost," says Brett, sitting in the bungalow with his
sister. "But I also think songs like 'Piece of My Heart' were
referencing the pain in his own heart, the knowledge that he had this
heart condition that was going to lead to his early demise."</TE>
<TE>   The bungalow is a virtual shrine to Berns. The walls are decorated
with old album covers and award plaques. Bookcases in an adjoining
room are filled with CDs, vinyl albums and 45-rpm singles of their
father's work.</TE>
<TE>   Brett signs onto the Internet daily, trying to hunt down obscure
singles or biographical tidbits for a book he's writing about his
father. There are also hopes for a film and a Broadway play based on
Berns' life and music.</TE>
<TE>   They've assembled a 26-page discography that not only lists all
Berns' writing and production credits but also the versions of his
songs by such artists as the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Otis
Redding and David Bowie. It's clear the children hear in the music
the voice of a father they never really knew.</TE>
<TE>   "He knew he was not going to live long enough to watch us grow
up," Brett says. "He told our mother that these songs would teach us
who he was, and it does feel at times that he is speaking to us in
these records."</TE>
<TE>   Brett and Cassandra also hope Morris' tribute CD will rekindle
enough interest in their father to spark his induction into the Hall
of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   To document their argument, they've printed a list of Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame members and highlighted the names of the artists
who either worked with their father or recorded his songs. The list
totals 18.</TE>
<TE>   In speculating on why he hasn't already been inducted, they wonder
whether lingering industry scuttlebutt about Berns' association with
"unsavory characters" has played a part.</TE>
<TE>   Joel Selvin, a San Francisco Chronicle pop critic and author who
has toyed for years with the idea of writing a Berns biography, says
he came across the underworld tales--but adds that the same could be
said about scores of music industry figures at the time. He describes
Berns as a "brilliant" pop mind who deserves Hall of Fame
consideration.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, Leiber &amp; Stoller invented a lot of this stuff," Selvin
says. "When you look at their proteges, there was Phil Spector, Burt
Bacharach and Bert Berns. He deserves to be thought of in those
terms. As far as the Hall of Fame goes, I think he's just not well
enough known today. His name has just slipped off the page."</TE>
<TE>   Berns' children also believe that their father's name, in the
absence of previous retrospective albums, has simply faded from
memory, and they hope the new CD is the first step in reintroducing
it.</TE>
<TE>   The breakfast crowd, meanwhile, has largely vacated the Peninsula
restaurant, but Morris is still talking about nuances in Berns' music
that a newcomer might not notice. He looks down at the cover of the
new CD.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone thinks the record business has changed a lot," he says.
"But it's the same as it was 40 years ago. Whether you find the music
on the Internet or in a record store, the business is all about
people who are able to create songs and touch people--and Bert was
one of those people."</TE>

<TE>   Three windows to his soul</TE>
<TE>   In "The Heart and Soul of Bert Berns," Doug Morris gives us a rich
survey of the darker, tortured side of Berns' music. But the
writer-producer's sound includes lighter tunes such as the Exciters'
feel-good "Tell Him" and Them's "Here Comes the Night," as well as
some recordings of songs that he didn't produce. Robert Hilburn
nominates three high points in the Berns legacy.</TE>
<TE>   Berns' Greatest Single Recording as a Writer and Producer: Solomon
Burke's "Cry to Me" (included on "Heart and Soul"), a Top 5 R&amp;B
single in 1962 on Atlantic Records. Berns loved explosive tension in
his records, but the great thing about this enchanting tune was its
restraint, a quality that makes Burke's eventual vocal outcry all the
more chilling. Berns was a master at getting great vocals out of
artists, but this may be his shining hour.</TE>
<TE>   Berns' Greatest Single Recording Solely as a Producer: Van
Morrison's "Brown Eyed Girl," a Top 10 single in 1967 on Berns' Bang
Records. Morrison, one of the most distinguished artists of the
modern pop era, has certainly written weightier songs, but he has
never felt more free or natural as a singer. And the track's opening
guitar lick is still one of the most inviting of the decade.</TE>
<TE>   Greatest Version of a Berns Composition That He Didn't Produce:
Janis Joplin's "Piece of My Heart," a Top 15 single with Big Brother
&amp; the Holding Company in 1968 on Columbia Records. Berns, who wrote
this lament with Jerry Ragovoy, had an R&amp;B hit with it in 1967 with
Aretha Franklin's younger sister, Erma, and it was a fine record.
Joplin's version was such a wounded expression of emotional
desperation that even Berns, who died in 1967, would have been
stunned.</TE>

<LD>If President Bush is really serious about this business of fighting
the Evil One and the Evil Axis, he might want to chat first with
Kenneth Anger, who's been on a first-name basis with the Prince of
Darkness for decades.</LD>
<LD>   How else to explain the Mephistophelean imprint on Anger's
cult-classic movies like "Lucifer Rising" (1981) and "Invocation of
My Demon Brother" (1969), which co-featured future Charles Manson
disciple Bobby Beausoleil and boasted a groovy Moog-synthesizer score
by his satanic majesty, Mick Jagger? Then there's Anger's latest
mini-opus, "The Man We Want to Hang," an 11-minute hommage to the
paintings of occult master Aleister Crowley.</LD>
<LD>   Forty years ago, some cultural bluenoses regarded Anger himself as
the antichrist. But without his wayward oeuvre, it's hard to imagine
David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" or Martin Scorsese's "Mean Streets."And
his baroque fixations oddly foreshadow the moralistic dialogue
swirling around American politics, though Anger's judgments are more
often rendered in puce than black and white.</LD>
<TE>   Lately, the former enfant terrible of American independent cinema,
who once famously declared that he considers movies "evil," is
spotting demonic influences practically everywhere -- in the Middle
East, Afghanistan, and among the mammon- worshippers of the U.S.
entertainment industry.</TE>
<TE>   "In Hollywood, Israel isn't talked about," says Anger, a boyish
septuagenarian, padding around his cryptic $600-a-month Echo Park
apartment. "The situation is so painful over there that it's largely
avoided by people that should be talking about it, because a lot of
them have a Jewish background. I call it 'Sharon's War.' "</TE>
<TE>   Anybody wanna slice and dice a few holy cows? Who better to wield
the obsidian blade than a filmmaker whose 29-minute montage
masterpiece "Scorpio Rising" (1963) probed the formerly underground
worlds of male homoeroticism and neo-Nazi biker gangs? The L.A. Vice
Squad was so upset with this subversion of middle-class decency that
it seized the print, sparking a landmark California Supreme Court
free-speech ruling in Anger's favor. That was back when sex could
still shock Americans. The next round of culture wars, Anger
believes, will be waged on different battlefields.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's plenty of other subjects that are edgy besides
sexuality," he says. Illegal immigrants in California, for instance.
"I hope it will never get to the point of race riots or things like
that. But it certainly has explosive possibility."</TE>
<TE>   You might say that Anger, the subject of a just-concluded
retrospective presented by the MAK Center for Art and Architecture
L.A. in collaboration with USC's School of Film and Television, has
been lobbing Molotov cocktails ever since he started making movies as
an adolescent.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine if Beach Boys impresario Brian Wilson had been born 12
years earlier, with a knack for making short Symbolist films instead
of surfer ditties, and you have Anger, a Santa Monica-bred, cinematic
Charles Baudelaire proffering a beautifully arranged bouquet of evil
flowers.</TE>
<TE>   Like Wilson, the youthful Anger was obsessed with America's
postwar juvenile culture: its pop icons, car fetishism, tribal gangs,
sexual experiments, boundless appetite for self-destruction and
altered states of consciousness. Wilson picked up the good
vibrations. Anger channeled the bad.</TE>
<TE>   His reputation as a cult figure was cemented by two wittily
written, gruesomely illustrated collections of Tinseltown dirty
laundry, "Hollywood Babylon" and "Hollywood Babylon II." "Hollywood
Babylon III," is on the way, though today "it's harder to find
stories that are titillating," Anger says.</TE>
<TE>   Gracious and gossipy, Anger wears a neat blue-and-white check
shirt, baggy green trousers and sneakers. His hair, a shade of
auburn, is sparse but assertive. He says he finds contemporary movies
"too long, too loud and too shallow," with happy exceptions like the
widely panned "Death to Smoochy," a satire of kiddie TV shows that
Anger saw four times.</TE>
<TE>   He loathes hip-hop and is "waiting for it to die." "How many cops
can you kill on your record?" he asks. "How many women can you call
whores?" He also refuses to learn his way around cyberspace.
Computers unleash "Abramelin demons," he says, "electronic sprites
that are enslaved to make all that machinery work. And I don't want
them in my house."</TE>
<TE>   Better to work with the devil you know than the devil you don't.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Anger believes that the most diabolical threat to free
artistic expression worldwide is radical Islam, citing the goons who
blew up the giant buddhas in Bamian, Afghanistan, a few months before
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   As for the prospect of a desert dust-up with Iraq, he thinks that
getting rid of Saddam Hussein is "unfinished business from 1991 that
Bush Sr. should've taken care of."</TE>
<TE>   Anger's fiery political views may startle those who know him only
as an avant-garde bad boy who dared conclude his dreamily
sado-homoerotic "Fireworks" (1947) with the image of a Roman candle
exploding from a sailor's fly. But if that's not political, what is?
"Sweet Home Alabama"?</TE>
<TE>   Current box office hits aside, Anger still thinks that art, and
film in particular, can be a portal to higher states of perception --
but at a price. Art that aspires to say something important sometimes
attacks our holiest truisms -- figuratively, that is. The real danger
comes from those who would destroy art literally, thereby unleashing
the rough beast with "666" emblazoned on its back.</TE>
<TE>   These things go in cycles, Anger believes: creation and
destruction, beauty and barbarism. The Nazis banned "degenerate art."
The Taliban and Al Qaeda blow up 1,600-year-old statues. Hollywood,
of course, blows stuff up all the time, but those are mostly just
burnt offerings to the pagan gods of overseas marketing.</TE>
<TE>   "Savonarola ostentatiously burned Botticellis," Anger says,
referring to the puritanical Renaissance cleric and the Florentine
master painter. "It's called iconoclasm, which means to destroy art.
And it's amazing that it's still with us." Will the real devils
please stand up?</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Original pirate material / Yer listening to the streets / Lock
down your aerial," enunciates Mike Skinner dryly, stretching his
already broad English (specifically, Birmingham) accent to get around
the words, launching another verbose but brilliant rap slicing like a
long knife to the distressed heart of U.K. pop culture.</TE>
<TE>   The 23-year-old Skinner, a.k.a. the Streets, is the baby-faced
king of "two-step garage," a kind of lo-fi hip-hop based on
down-tempo, minimalist drum-and-bass-derived beats, often created on
downloadable "studio" programs or even Playstation beat software,
providing barely moving backdrops for clever lyrics.</TE>
<TE>   And Skinner's are more than clever -- not only has he dominated
the highly competitive Brixton garage scene, but he's also shocked
the fad-famished British press into writing rueful diatribes about
the birth of a form as truly streetwise as original punk, dub or ska.</TE>
<TE>   Released in March in the U.K. and due in U.S. stores Oct. 22, the
Streets' album "Original Pirate Material" takes full advantage of
Skinner's middle-class Midlands life as a platform for a sweetly
swaggering examination of substance-abusing geezerdom and birdhood
that's as darkly comic as "Trainspotting."</TE>
<TE>   The single "Has It Come to This?" sets the pace, a rap on living
honestly with the lads in the gutter, delivered over understated
loops of bass and tick-tack percussion. These tracks are
distinguished by the conspicuous lack of R&amp;B samples; there are some
silky borrowed vocals, but the hooks are all homemade. Garage is a
sound foreshadowing the end of hip-hop's leaning too hard on
overplayed R&amp;B.</TE>
<TE>   Quick wit and wisdom</TE>
<TE>   The Streets is also a whole lot of dirty, sketchy fun. "Geezers
Need Excitement" probes the ethos of the drunken pub brawler with
incredible slang, such as, "By now you want to leather this twat"
(translation: at this point you want to hit this jerk).</TE>
<TE>   And the picture's not all negative: "Weak Become Heroes" is a
nostalgic, wistful rumination on the beautiful moments of club life

<TE>   Quick-witted, wise beyond anybody's 23 years and featuring lovely,
out-of-the-way production, "Original Pirate Material" is the first
big but quiet noise indicating that the next important pop music may
be coming off the Streets.</TE>

<HD>Refocusing on Crane</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul Schrader, who brands Bob Crane an unsavory "creep" ("Into the
Deep End," Sept. 29), has, obviously, directed "Auto Focus" as a film
even more inexcusable than the "Hogan's Heroes" sitcom.</LD>
<LD>   "Auto Focus" producer Scott Alexander is also quoted. "You're
taking somebody's life and turning it into an hour and 40 minutes, so
there's bound to be something you left out" -- like Crane's
dedication as an actor who spurned an offer to succeed Jack Paar on
"The Tonight Show" so that he might hone his craft, or the thousands
he invested in government bonds at 4% instead of bank CDs at 6%
because "this country's been good to me."</LD>
<LD>   Arguably the most listenable DJ in L.A. history, Crane helped
uncover and establish several entertainment icons. Crane was an
attentive dad who spent his summertime weekends poolside or at the
Encino Little League Park and trick-or-treating each Halloween with
his kids. In 1963, for months, a dozen roses (with unsigned cards)
mysteriously arrived daily at Crane's KNX office. Finally, CBS
staffers discovered they had been sent by a fan, Alfred Hitchcock.</LD>
<TE>   Schrader says, "Crane didn't have any friends." It's a shame that
some of his musician buddies -- Henry Mancini, Johnny Green and
Bronislaw Kaper -- aren't around to refute the inaccuracy. I am.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the Calendar article, "Auto Focus" is a one-dimensional
cheap shot of Bob Crane that is, sadly, out of focus.</TE>

<LD>As an avid theater fan since the early 1960s who has seen more than
450 performances of small and large theater, I can tell you a lot of
things have changed besides ticket prices ("Getting Steeper All the
Time," Oct. 6).</LD>
<LD>   First, forget about choice seating unless you buy an entire season
series or pay premium ticket-broker prices. Most seats available to
the general public after season ticket-holders get theirs are simply
lousy.</LD>
<LD>   Second, hardly a serious drama can make it to the stage no matter
how skilled the writer. Consider Albee's plays, which barely make it
in New York even after great publicity and promotion. The majority of
the public still just needs and wants song and dance.</LD>
<TE>   Finally, theater is supposed to be a respectful dialogue between
audience and actor. Shorts and tank tops should be banned, as well as
talking during performances, when you are paying $50 to $100 per
ticket.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Natalie Nichols' piece on Black Flag ("Black Flag, Unfurled," Oct. 6)
was helpful to me, at first. As a 48-year-old knucklehead earnestly
in search of punk's eternal meaning and important throbs, I was
loving every word until I read "time-warped guitar style," "internal
cadences." And, this one was especially peculiar: "deliberately
avoided creating an image."</LD>
<LD>   Huh?</LD>
<LD>   Guitar styles have to do with rhythm, technique, guitar-lessons
learned -- and passion. Time warps don't pertain unless the guitarist
recorded, under the influence of LSD, on Mars. Internal cadences have
more to do with tango lessons than Black Flag. As for deliberately
avoiding the creation of an image, the report suggests an actual
meeting to examine the commercial ramifications of "image."</LD>
<TE>   Here's my educated guess: The guitarist was firmly rooted in the
present and had his own idea of style that his bandmates found
acceptable -- or even perfect -- for them. Cadences had everything to
do with song structure and the crowd, but very little to do with
internal moods or the heartbeat of any band member. And the band
"deliberately" avoided creating an image just like Muddy Waters and
Hank Williams and Neil Young and Jackson Browne and Nirvana did.
Which is to say, they simply didn't think about it at the time,
because they couldn't have cared less.</TE>
<TE>   I need way more better language, y'all. Don't make me call Henry
Rollins for help on this.</TE>

<LD>Lyn Henderson Moran blames activist groups like NOW for "letting" the
entertainment media freeze out older women (Letters, Oct. 6). That
makes about as much sense as blaming the NAACP for decades of black
movie roles limited to Butterfly McQueens and Stepin Fetchits. If
Moran needs a culprit, she should look instead at Hollywood's
near-total enslavement to demographics -- forcing everyone,
regardless of age or taste, to endure entertainment designed
primarily to appeal to 15- to 29-year-old men.</LD>

Possibly one of the sexiest female characters ever created, not to

<LD>The removal of the Siqueiros mural -- "Portrait of Mexico Today,
1932" -- from its original location in Pacific Palisades to the Santa
Barbara Museum of Art earlier this year is to be profoundly regretted
("A Wall on the Fly," Oct. 6).</LD>
<LD>   His only other surviving work in L.A. -- "America Tropical" -- has
been the object of intense efforts over the last decade by the Getty
Conservation Institute to conserve it in situ. By contrast, the
small, private and discrete "Portrait of Mexico Today, 1932" has
largely avoided public attention, with seemingly few objections being
raised to its removal and shipment to Santa Barbara.</LD>
<LD>   What seems to have been entirely overlooked are the devastating
consequences for this action. Not only will the painting have been
mutilated by its removal (even if concealed by retouching), it will
forever have lost its sociopolitical context -- surely one of the
defining aspects for any mural.</LD>
<TE>   Prevailing conservation ethics unambiguously reject such action
and consider detachment of wall paintings only as an absolute last
resort to ensure their preservation. There has never been any
suggestion that this was the case at Amalfi Drive. As such, the Santa
Barbara Museum of Art has unwittingly been instrumental in the
harming of an important work of art through its eagerness in
accepting this donation.</TE>
<TE>   Siqueiros was a key progenitor of a sociopolitical mural-painting
tradition that thrives to this day in its many diverse forms in Los
Angeles. What a loss to the city for one of its best preserved and
most important works to be hewn from its rightful place and freighted
off to join an assembly of aesthetic objects divorced from any
context in a museum in Santa Barbara. Would one really wish to see
Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling in a gallery in New York?</TE>

<TE>   The Chouinard Art School was not in Pasadena, but on Grand View
Street in L.A., just a block south of MacArthur Park. The concrete
wall on which Siqueiros painted his first California mural faced the
north parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   His student assistants during the experiment were Millard Sheets,
Lee Blair and Scollard Mass. I have a good photo of the group on the
scaffold watching Siqueiros spraying paint into the wet plaster.
Sheets had been a liaison between Nelbert Chouinard and Siqueiros
when the muralist was hired to teach in summer 1932. There was an
incorrect rumor that Chouinard was horrified at the
communist-inspired theme and had had the fresco painted out. In
truth, she was naively apolitical and always put good art first. In
this case, she saw the attempt as bad art, an occasional occurrence
with students at Chouinard, where everyone learned together.</TE>
<TE>   Sheets, Blair and painting instructor Richard Haines all told me
that when the mural was dry, the colors appeared weak and faded. For
Siqueiros, who had wanted to experiment with the spray gun, it was
probably a failure. Within a year or two, the plaster was chipped off
the wall. It is hard to believe, however, that no one photographed
his attempt. Sheets, of course, went on to create his own murals and
mosaics, and Lee and Mary Blair became shiny cogs in the Disney
Studios wheel.</TE>

<HD>Oh, the comparisons</HD>
<DH>Composer Osvaldo Golijov is unafraid of breaking the mold.
But he's nervous about being called the next Mozart.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Lieberman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>Lenox, Mass.</DL>
<LD>The talk about him and Mozart began innocently enough, as a midsummer
joke.</LD>
<LD>   Osvaldo Golijov was at the annual music festival on Cape Cod for a
performance of his "The Dreams and Prayers of Isaac the Blind." When
the players finished it, they beckoned him onto the stage of the
Brewster Baptist Church to share the audience's standing ovation, a
form of ego stroking the 41-year-old composer has had to get used to
of late.</LD>
<LD>   If there was any danger of it going to his head, his family was
there to make sure it didn't.</LD>
<TE>   Before the concert, his wife kidded him about a feature in the
local newspaper that said it took "the devotion of a saint" to
produce works like his. Silvia Golijov said, "Yeah, devotion of a
saint wife."</TE>
<TE>   Two of his children got him next. When the Borromeo String Quartet
launched into Golijov's musical interpretation of Jewish prayer,
7-year-old Anna curled onto her mom's lap -- and fell asleep. Brother
Yoni, 12, at least pretended to pay attention to the music, in which
his dad asks the performers to imagine themselves "shivering before
God." But five minutes in, Yoni closed his eyes and slumped forward
in feigned slumber. Papa nudged him in the ribs, and up he popped.</TE>
<TE>   The musicians did their part, as well, as soon as they concluded
the concert with a chorus singing the sublime "Ave Verum Corpus," a
three-minute work that Mozart wrote in the last months of his life.
Backstage, as they packed their instruments, Golijov set himself up
by gushing how "one concert that would be really great would be to
play the 'Ave Verum' 10 times--just the 'Ave Verum.' "</TE>
<TE>   The evening's soloist, clarinetist Todd Palmer, grabbed him by the
shoulders and laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "Ozzie, even if you do get great someday," he said, "you'll never
be as great as Mozart."</TE>
<TE>   "You have to know you're gonna die!" Golijov protested. "Then it's
easy!"</TE>
<TE>   And that was it, a little jesting among friends, until a couple of
weeks later, when someone else used Golijov's name in the same
sentence with Mozart's ... and this time they weren't joking.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps a baseball player would be flattered to be called the next
Babe Ruth, or an artist the new Picasso.</TE>
<TE>   What Golijov said then was, "That's very stupid."</TE>
<TE>   One work changed it all</TE>
<TE>   The burden of such comparisons was hardly one of Osvaldo Golijov's
worries two years ago, when he was the least known of four composers
who had been asked to produce Passions to commemorate the 250th
anniversary of Bach's death. Though he had a following in chamber
music circles for his intense string pieces, Golijov was well off the
radar screen of the public and had never produced a full
concert-length work, much less anything like Bach's stirring Passions
based on the Gospels of Matthew and John.</TE>
<TE>   But they wanted a diversity of voices for the Bach celebration,
and he was a good bet to provide that, a Jew from Argentina raised on
the classics and tango alike before settling in a Boston suburb --
and a member of the generation of young composers not tied to any
musical "ism" except eclecticism.</TE>
<TE>   Golijov gave them a different Jesus indeed, not a pale European
one, but a dark Latin American. He gave them different music too, in
bold leaps of style and mood: a few traditional arias, sure, but
mixed with rumba, flamenco, tango. And why couldn't Jesus shake a
pair of maracas as he crossed the stage? Why couldn't his persecutors
push him along the road to crucifixion with dance-like Brazilian
martial arts, including a twirling kick to the face?</TE>
<TE>   When "La Pasion Segun San Marcos" debuted in Stuttgart in
September 2000, it was hard to tell how all this was going over. The
German audience sat silently for an hour and a half and, despite the
intense Latin rhythms, not a head was seen to bob, or a foot tap.
Then the music ended, and they cheered for 20 minutes. Five months
later, the North American premiere set off pandemonium again.</TE>
<TE>   By this summer, Golijov's Passion still had been performed only a
handful of times and had been seen by fewer people than go to a
single Bruce Springsteen show. But that was enough to gain it a page
full of critics' blurbs like those normally found in blaring movie
ads: "the first indisputably great composition of the 21st century,"
"genius," "timeless." The New Yorker said the piece had "a
revolutionary air, as if musical history were starting over."</TE>
<TE>   That buzz was in the air when Golijov embarked this year on what
was, in essence, a six-month victory lap. The Passion would not be
performed until the end, at the Tanglewood Music Festival here in the
Berkshires, setting the stage for its New York and West Coast
premieres, the latter Friday and Saturday at the Orange County
Performing Arts Center. Before that, Golijov was
composer-in-residence everywhere you turned, unveiling smaller works
from an imagination seemingly expanding by the moment.</TE>
<TE>   He was in Minneapolis in March, with songs for soprano Dawn
Upshaw, drawn from poems of Emily Dickinson. Then in New York, with a
piece inspired by something film director Federico Fellini once said
about using light to make reality disappear. He composed a tone poem
for an art film about the Sept. 11 attacks, and a piece for South
Carolina's Spoleto Festival, this one prompted by two experiences of
his own: a trip to Israel, as the suicide bombings began again, and a
visit with his son to a planetarium, where the Earth became, from
space, "a little blue dot." He tried to capture both realities with
music that "never touched ground."</TE>
<TE>   He might have ended the road trip after Vermont's renowned
Marlboro Festival, and passed up the low-key Cape event, where
opening night meant 292 people in a church with a noisy air
conditioner. But that was an opportunity to give the family an August
holiday on a picture-postcard inlet. Then his wife saw him running
off to rehearsals and sound checks.</TE>
<TE>   "You call this a vacation?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Sort of," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A battered car, a magazine cover</TE>
<TE>   "There's Dawn!"</TE>
<TE>   Golijov rushes to get the singer, who is finishing a morning walk
amid the tall pines of the Berkshires. Sixteen days after the Cape
opening, we're on the porch of a cabin near the Tanglewood festival
grounds where Golijov's Passion will be performed in the evening. But
that's not why he's nervous.</TE>
<TE>   The Boston Symphony has announced that he will compose a chamber
opera for next summer's festival here, and that the piece is being
co-commissioned by Lincoln Center and the Los Angeles Philharmonic --
his first major work since the St. Mark Passion. As if that isn't
enough, what subject has he picked?</TE>
<TE>   "Child sacrifice in the Middle East" -- from the suicide bombers
to the kids in Israeli settlements -- "if I don't get too scared."</TE>
<TE>   As soon as Upshaw takes a seat on the porch, he asks her to join
him at a Tanglewood meeting on the project. The soprano of choice for
many contemporary composers, she's a longtime member of Golijov's
second family, musical co-conspirators who come to him time and
again, to write or arrange for them--the Kronos Quartet, the St.
Lawrence String Quartet, the Mexican rockers Cafe Tacuba and even a
Gypsy band, Taraf de Haidouks. Upshaw has agreed to be the star of
his opera, but she's not sure mere "talent" belongs in the Tanglewood
discussion.</TE>
<TE>   "Please," he says, then drops to a whisper, "OK, if you have
better things to do ... "</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, no," she says, and he has her.</TE>
<TE>   Golijov heads to the kitchen to get her a glass of water, and to
prepare bitter Argentine matte tea for himself. He's in a Hawaiian
shirt, jeans shorts and running shoes. He has a marathoner's wiry
build and wears his dark hair close-cropped, almost spiky. With his
slit-like, wire-frame glasses, his look is nerdy cool, in the manner
of Buddy Holly. After he returns with the tea, I ask why he doesn't
have flunkies bringing it, like a rock star would, now that he has
been anointed the new Mozart.</TE>
<TE>   When he says, "Nah, you are making that up," it's clear he has not
seen the latest Gramophone magazine: "Osvaldo Golijov: Hailed the
'Mozart of Our Time.' "</TE>
<TE>   "On the cover?" Upshaw asks. "That could set him up for a big
fall."</TE>
<TE>   "I know!" he says.</TE>
<TE>   "No offense," she says. "You can't say that about anybody. It's
ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   He parodies a moment in American political debate. "I know Mozart
-- and I am no Mozart. When Mozart was writing operas at age 12, I
was still cutting class in school trying to go to X-rated movies with
my friends."</TE>
<TE>   On he goes. "Mozart was like Spielberg," he decides. "There were
like 5,000 composers in Vienna out of 250,000 citizens, you know?
Today you have like 5,000 composers in the United States, out of 300
million people. The Mozart is a moviemaker or an Internet game
designer."</TE>
<TE>   What he can't make light of is the pressure that comes with such
accolades, hype or not -- especially given his answer to the
inevitable "What's next?" Had he failed with the Passion, who would
have noticed? Now he's the new new thing, the flavor of the month,
and he wants to do an hourlong opera about the most explosive spot on
Earth.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people who have success have to go through the woods,
you know," says Upshaw, who saw it happen two years ago when she was
in Pulitzer Prize winner John Harbison's "The Great Gatsby" when it
opened at Lincoln Center. The opera got a tremendous buildup, but it
wasn't ready for the Met spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   Golijov saw what happened with John Adams' lightning-rod opera
"The Death of Klinghoffer," about the murder of a wheelchair-bound
U.S. tourist by terrorists on a cruise ship. Adams hoped to develop
the sensitive work in private but "had journalists from 12 countries
coming for just a piano workshop," Golijov recalls.</TE>
<TE>   He could still opt for a safer topic for his chamber opera, which
is scheduled to make its way to Los Angeles in February 2004, and he
again urges Upshaw to go with him to the meeting with conductor
Robert Spano and others.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still worried about my ability to do that," he says. "Please
come. Bring your aura."</TE>
<TE>   "I'll wash it first," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Which means she needs to get to the house where she's staying. We
climb into Golijov's Honda Civic with its dents, broken air
conditioner and 143,000 miles.</TE>
<TE>   He says, "You can put in there that Mozart is riding in a
12-year-old car that his wife refuses to ride in."</TE>
<TE>   Under the piano</TE>
<TE>   If you ask Golijov where he considers himself "from" these days,
he gives the musician's answer -- it's not about a physical place,
but time, "the place of the spirit." But it's his personal geography
that is written into the notes of his music.</TE>
<TE>   He was born in 1960 in La Plata, south of Buenos Aires, to a
pianist mother. The first of her four children, he was raised under
her piano, where at an early age he could hear that a Bach suite
wasn't one line of music but three, "each complete and beautiful in
its own right," yet "making perfect sense together." Before long, he
was playing the organ in synagogue and performing his first
composition at local schools.</TE>
<TE>   His family was from Eastern Europe -- his mother's side from
Romania, his father's from Russia -- before immigrating in the 1920s
to escape anti-Semitism and poverty. His mother's people were
Orthodox Jews, and Osvaldo shared his room for a time with a
great-grandfather who rose at all hours to pray by the window. Far
from highbrow, the Romanian kin were a link to Gypsy and klezmer
music, the sort played at old-country Jewish weddings.</TE>
<TE>   His father's people fancied themselves "big thinkers" and were
devout communists -- until they saw that Stalin was a butcher.</TE>
<TE>   His grandfather played chess, drank and cursed the world. His
father was a doctor who loved Tchaikovsky. But when tango master
Astor Piazzolla came to town, he made sure Osvaldo heard him too.</TE>
<TE>   At 23, Osvaldo took off with Silvia, then his girlfriend, to study
in Jerusalem, where he made ends meet by teaching exercise classes,
sit-ups and all. Three years later, in 1986, he was accepted into a
PhD program at the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied under
composer George Crumb, delivered Domino's pizza and took off a
semester -- to be with his mother, back home, when she was battling
cancer.</TE>
<TE>   That was when he began having trouble sleeping, invariably
stirring awake after a few hours, "I guess," he says now, "to check
if she was still breathing."</TE>
<TE>   He was not there at the end, though: Silvia was pregnant with
their first child and they needed to be near their hospital in
Philadelphia. Their daughter, Talia, was born the same week his
mother died, at 58, giving him this to ponder -- how life and death
come as a package.</TE>
<TE>   All these years later, Golijov still cannot sleep through the
night. The insomnia frustrated him at first, and he saw a shrink
about it, but there was no easy cure. The man suggested he make the
best of it -- if he couldn't fall back asleep in 10 minutes, "do
something productive." That's when he began stacking plays and poetry
and essays by his bed, and using the dark hours to find inspiration
for the works that now bring audiences to their feet.</TE>
<TE>   Watch him at a rehearsal with a string quartet, sitting in the
fourth row, looking like a wrestler giving himself a headlock, with
his left arm wrapped over the top, and his right arm around the back
of his neck, just listening. Finally he unwinds, and strides toward
the musicians to tell them how he "just noticed" a stage direction in
a Chekhov play -- from one of those 3 a.m. reading sessions, no doubt
-- that speaks of "a harp string breaking loose."</TE>
<TE>   He is explaining a moment where his music goes from a joyous
klezmer dance to a slow waltz and becomes, for a instant, "very, very
ghostly." He wants it to be the experience of something unexpected,
that "tears you apart."</TE>
<TE>   If his mother's death taught him the uses of the night, his
father's, at a more natural 72, reminded him never to think himself
above the music of the streets.</TE>
<TE>   When they discussed what his father would want to hear at the end,
it was Schubert. But there was a tango CD nearby, of Anibal Troilo's
band, and when the time came, "he pointed to the Troilo. So I guess
that in the last minutes it's truly what you have in your heart, not
what you plan."</TE>
<TE>   Sold-out 'Pasion'</TE>
<TE>   Tanglewood's Seiji Ozawa Hall is sold out for "La Pasion Segun San
Marcos," and the crowd is thick with cognoscenti who want to witness
for themselves, or witness again, those bold leaps of style and mood.
Not in the hall, however, are the three Golijov kids. "They decided
to see 'Friends,' " he says and shrugs when he arrives with Silvia.
Someone offered them six videotaped episodes of the TV sitcom back at
the cabin. How could they refuse?</TE>
<TE>   Though Argentina is an officially Catholic nation, he didn't know
the New Testament well when he was asked to write the Passion. But
the Gospel according to Mark wasn't his only nighttime reading then:
He studied the diaries of Che Guevara, the guerrilla fighter betrayed
by those around him and gunned down in the jungles of Bolivia; he
researched the Indians, who planted crucifixes with their corn to
help it grow, and were burned to death for blasphemy; he discovered
Bartolome de las Casas, repentant slave owner and the first Latin
American ordained as a priest.</TE>
<TE>   On paper, it may read like an exercise in political correctness,
but that's not what it sounds like in the auditorium, where, after a
performance like tonight's, a small crowd clusters around Silvia to
exclaim how for once they experienced multiculturalism as more than a
slogan. Someone else says the Passion makes other "high art" suddenly
seem far too distant. Then there are those rhythms.</TE>
<TE>   Though the conductor, soloists and symphony players may vary,
Golijov has insisted that two groups be part of every performance to
date: Orquesta la Pasion, the percussionists he has worked with from
the start, and a 53-voice Venezuelan chorus, which sometimes chants
as an angry mob and sometimes speaks for characters from Jesus to
Judas. Other times, Jesus is Reynaldo Gonzalez Fernandez, a
Cuban-born singer, dancer and percussionist.</TE>
<TE>   The classical soprano, Upshaw, has only two arias. The last word
goes to the chorus as God, singing to Jesus in Spanish, while
Brazilian vocalist Luciana Souza performs a Kaddish, the Jewish
prayer for the dead, in ancient Aramaic. The frequent frenzy of the
Christian story of death and resurrection ends with the haunting
reflections of Golijov's own tradition.</TE>
<TE>   After the audience does its usual thing, there's a cast party.
When Golijov enters, members of the Venezuelan chorus hold up their
index fingers and chant "Para Uno! Para Uno!" The Afro-Cuban Jesus
gathers the drummers. A dance line forms. Golijov makes his way to
the bar to get a beer. "Enjoy. Be happy," Upshaw tells him there.
"Enjoy. At least for tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Back to work</TE>
<TE>   IN September, he was back home in Newton, Mass., taking the kids
to school each morning, then heading to the basement apartment in
Brookline that he has converted to a studio. It was time to get back
to work, alone, away from the hype.</TE>
<TE>   The victory-lap bows are not all that outsiders imagine. "It's
nice, but it's not the moment for me," he says. "The moment is when I
am at the piano."</TE>
<TE>   The walls of his studio display life at its best, with photos of
the kids at play and "Welcome Home Dad!" artwork. But sitting on the
piano is a page from the Lamentations of Jeremiah: "How doth the city
sit solitary, that was full of people! How is she become as a widow!"
He will almost certainly use that in his opera. Back on the Cape, he
already had a stack of reading matter to get him thinking about the
project, including books on Jerusalem and biblical sites and two
volumes of librettos, seven of German composers, seven of Verdi's.
Later, he met with an Israeli father who brought coffins to the U.N.
to remind the world of the children killed.</TE>
<TE>   Now he has to turn the thoughts he grappled with at night into
sound. It's never easy. "All my music, even if I try to be serene and
content," he says, "it kind of leads me to scary places."</TE>
<TE>   At the start of October, he shut off his e-mail. He needed to get
down notes before the next road trip, before the West Coast and New
York Passions, when he would be treated again like the second coming
of, if not Mozart, then perhaps, a Mussorgsky.</TE>
<TE>   He insists, "I am not even a Mussorgsky."</TE>

<LD>As an eloquent chronicler of the 20th century, San Francisco
photographer Dorothea Lange took many images that captured the
American experience before, during and after World War II. Her
magnificent "Migrant Mother, Nipomo, California," taken in 1936, has
become a classic image of the Great Depression. About Life: The
Photographs of Dorothea Lange, opening Tuesday at the J. Paul Getty
Museum, features about 80 photographs drawn primarily from the
Getty's permanent collection. In addition to "Migrant Mother," which
the Getty purchased in 1998, the exhibition includes photographs
taken for the Farm Security Administration and Life magazine.</LD>

<LD>Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the 20th Century ingeniously
captures the splintered insights and cut-and-paste aesthetic of Greil
Marcus' cult-classic book about the rise of Britain's ur-punk-rock
outfit the Sex Pistols, with nods to the Dadaists, a 16th century
priest and the French student radicals of 1968. Adapted by the Rude
Mechanicals of Austin, Texas, it is suitably self-subverting, staying
aloft through its unnerving energy and brutally wistful poetry.</LD>

<DH>"I did not bring my interpreter with me, so I hope the
Boston accent with some New York nuances will not be too difficult to
understand." --William Bratton</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Mehren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Memo to police chief-designate Bratton:</LD>
<LD>   Freeway etiquette, earthquake preparedness, the location of the
nearest Trader Joe's. So much to learn about Los Angeles!</LD>
<LD>   Oh, and out here our alphabet contains 26 letters.</LD>
<TE>   All these years, as a good Boston boy, you've been making do with
25. (Yankees are frugal even when it comes to speech.) But like a
really bad suit from Filene's Basement, that won't cut it in Palm
Paradise.</TE>
<TE>   Quite possibly, the surprise quiz you may encounter when you face
City Council confirmation is, "What letter comes between Q and S?"</TE>
<TE>   Hint: The answer is not AAAAAAH.</TE>
<TE>   Stay in Southern California long enough, and you will discover
that R is a lovely concept. Think: din-NER; thea-TER; dri-VER;
may-OR. Roll that unfamiliar sound around in the back of your throat.
Grab that R and growl it. Say it long enough and loud enough in front
of your mir-ROR and soon, that forgotten letter will sound elegant,
cosmopolitan, charming. Definitely western.</TE>
<TE>   Your troops may look perplexed if you tell them to work "haaadah,"
or if you commend them for pushing their standards "hi-ya." But
adding an unnecessary R at the end of some words is a Boston blunder.
Get the ideer, chief?</TE>
<TE>   In L.A., the most important word is the one that describes a
motorized vehicle. Since a remedial R program may take time, you may
want to announce that henceforth an auto in L.A. also will be known
as a caah.</TE>
<TE>   Along with pronunciation issues, you will discover that Angelenos
use the language differently. Don't be surprised if your audience
goes blank when you commend your force for doing a "wicked good" job
of solving some crime. In L.A., "wicked" refers only to stepmothers,
one of the city's most revolving career options.</TE>
<TE>   (Q: What do you call a sugary, nonalcoholic carbonated cold drink
that comes in a can or bottle?</TE>
<TE>   A: Unlike in Boston, the correct response is not "tonic.")</TE>
<TE>   As a Bostonian, you may be inclined to show enthusiasm through
unusual sentence structure. When someone in L.A. asks if you enjoy
something, resist the urge to reply, "And so don't I!"</TE>

<HD>At long last, a portrait of Frida</HD>
<DH>After false starts by others, Julie Taymor wins the battle
to film Kahlo's story -- and keep Miramax from cutting it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lorenza Munoz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Julie Taymor sits in the darkened editing room with a cup of coffee
at her side, reading glasses perched loosely on the tip of her thin
nose. Her latest movie, "Frida," proceeds in slow motion on the
screen. And she seems resigned to the task at hand -- picking stills
for publicity.</LD>
<LD>   Her instincts are running contrary to what the studio publicist,
sitting beside her, believes will sell the movie to magazines. But
her afternoon with the publicist is a breezy formality compared with
"Frida's" arduous journey to the screen.</LD>
<LD>   After an eight-year odyssey involving a dozen screenwriters, half
a dozen directors, seven producers, two studios and one cable
network, the story of Mexican painter Frida Kahlo finally will reach
theaters Oct. 25. On the editing room screen this day, pain contorts
actress Salma Hayek's face after Kahlo suffers a brutal trolley car
accident. Her agony is so literal, so close to death, that tiny
yellow skulls are reflected in Hayek's light brown eyes.</LD>
<TE>   Taymor adores this image. The publicist hates it.</TE>
<TE>   In another scene, Hayek as Frida puffs sensually on a filterless
cigarette. The smoke surrounds her in a luminous white cloud,
contrasting with her dark hair and coloring. Again, Taymor gets
excited -- the lighting is so serene and Hayek's profile so
sculptured.</TE>
<TE>   The publicist immediately torpedoes that image. Beautiful it may
be, but the last time Miramax, the distributor, showed a character
smoking (Sissy Spacek as the grieving mother in "In the Bedroom"),
anti-smoking crusaders excoriated the studio.</TE>
<TE>   "I know what the glamour shots are," Taymor gently tells the
publicist. "I just happen to love some of the more scary, traumatic
shots."</TE>
<TE>   "Traumatic" might describe Taymor's experience finishing the
movie. The shoot in Mexico went smoothly, ended on time and within
its $13-million budget (Mexico's Puebla doubled for Paris and
collages were used to suggest New York City). Then came trouble.</TE>
<TE>   A tussle over the film's length</TE>
<TE>   She and Miramax studio chief Harvey Weinstein publicly went at
each other's throats at a springtime screening of "Frida" in New
York. Weinstein, derided by some as Harvey Scissorhands for his
unsentimental cutting of films, and Taymor were at odds over the
film's length. Weinstein wanted to cut 10 minutes from the two-hour
movie; Taymor refused.</TE>
<TE>   "He was pretty rough on her about why she was wrong, and she was
pretty rough right back," said a source who was at the screening.
"And then the Mexican standoff, so to speak, began."</TE>
<TE>   Weinstein peppered Taymor with unsavory language. Taymor
threatened to take her name off the film, according to numerous
sources.</TE>
<TE>   When it was accepted into the Venice Film Festival in August, they
compromised. Taymor cut three minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Today, both are publicly upbeat. The director says there is
nothing to gain in rehashing the incident. Still, one gets the sense
she is biting her tongue.</TE>
<TE>   Over dinner at a Santa Monica restaurant, her publicity instinct
triumphs. "What you are seeing is my cut, but he is happy with it,"
she says. "He's got talent ..., but he has to trust the director."</TE>
<TE>   Weinstein said through a spokesman, "Julie is really talented, but
she needed to learn to trust me. Ultimately we both ended up trusting
each other and ended up with a great film."</TE>
<TE>   The woman who wowed Broadway with her vibrant adaptation of "The
Lion King" has successfully crossed over to Hollywood on a creative
level. Who, other than Taymor, could have persuaded someone to
finance a feature film based on Shakespeare's obscure tragedy "Titus
Andronicus"? The grim "Titus" was released by Fox Searchlight in 1999
to mixed reviews and did not perform well at the box office.</TE>
<TE>   It was the distinctive visual style of "Titus" combined with the
humanity of "The Lion King" that made her a seemingly ideal choice
for "Frida."</TE>
<TE>   "Frida," the movie, like the painter, suffered many near-deaths.
Producer Jay Polstein, who shepherded the project since its days at
now-defunct Trimark Pictures in 1994 when it came from HBO, said he
saw Kahlo's big-screen potential.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we could turn what was essentially a cable movie into a
feature film," said Polstein, currently with Maverick Entertainment.
"We wanted to get to the hippie art-house crowd and the Latino
market, and this seemed like the perfect project for that."</TE>
<TE>   When Trimark was absorbed by Lions Gate Entertainment, Polstein
and Hayek brought the film to Miramax, where it languished. The movie
finally went into production when Taymor agreed to direct.</TE>
<TE>   If an American had to helm the film about Mexico's first modern
feminist painter, Taymor -- a female artist who has traveled often to
Mexico -- would seem a reasonable candidate. But she wasn't on the
studio's first list of directors.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Gill, head of the Miramax office in Los Angeles, happened to
run into her at a PBS conference two years ago and suggested she read
the script. Directors Walter Salles ("Central Station") and Pedro
Almodovar ("All About My Mother") flirted briefly with the film but
backed out because of scheduling conflicts. Some of the script's
rewriters included Salles, Rodrigo Garcia ("Things You Can Tell Just
by Looking at Her") and a polish by Edward Norton, Hayek's boyfriend.
Taymor quickly impressed Gill with insightful critiques and solutions
to problems that had stumped the writers.</TE>
<TE>   "She was very fast to come up with really interesting ideas," said
Gill.</TE>
<TE>   Taymor, who usually prefers to initiate her own projects, said
"Frida" was the first worthwhile script she had read in years. It was
Hayek's moving appeal, however, that sealed the deal. Hayek (who told
one producer she believed she was Frida Kahlo reincarnated) had been
obsessed with making the movie for more than a decade. All her
passion came flowing out on Taymor's couch one September afternoon in
New York.</TE>
<TE>   "She sits down on the couch in my living room and proceeds to
entrance me with incredible stories of Frida, Mexico and her saga of
trying to make this movie," said Taymor, a trim 49-year-old with
sandy brown hair and penetrating brown eyes. "I, like everyone else
in this country, only know Salma from 'Desperado,' 'Wild Wild West'
... not the most wonderful examples of her talent." On that
afternoon, she continued, "I was so moved by her talent, intelligence
and charisma. I thought, 'Why hasn't this translated onto the
screen?' "</TE>
<TE>   On the topic of Hayek -- who has been maligned as a mere soap
opera actress known more for her Jessica Rabbit figure than for
making good movies -- Taymor is like a lioness defending her young.
At the suggestion that Hayek used an acting coach, Taymor bristles.</TE>
<TE>   There was a coach, she concedes, but "the woman came down and
never touched Salma. Salma should be alleviated from that because she
didn't need a coach. What she needed was a good part, a company that
believed in her and a director that could work with her."</TE>
<TE>   Apart from coaxing good performances from her actors and wrestling
with Weinstein, Taymor's struggle was primarily in condensing Kahlo's
life into a two-hour movie.</TE>
<TE>   Taymor, the unyielding artist, had to find a middle ground with
Taymor, the pragmatic director. The movie had to be somewhat
commercial, but not at the expense of its authenticity.</TE>
<TE>   Kahlo's life became a coming-of-age tale about a feisty, young
woman who survives a terrible accident, falls in love with a
philanderer and finds a voice to express her pain through art.</TE>
<TE>   Although Kahlo suffered lifelong pain from the accident (her
pelvis was impaled) and prolonged complications (including,
eventually, a traumatic miscarriage), the movie is surprisingly
cheery. Taymor says she didn't see Kahlo as a "dark San Sebastian
victim of infidelity and physical abuse." She was, instead, "a
complex, funny, foulmouthed, erotic person. Her story is about
transcendence." The film is something of a Reader's Digest guide to
some of Kahlo's most noted paintings, including a depiction of her
miscarriage in "Henry Ford Hospital," Kahlo's dueling personalities
in "The Two Fridas" and the couple's union in "Frida With Diego."</TE>
<TE>   The story focuses more on the unorthodox love between Frida and
Diego Rivera, her husband (played by Alfred Molina), than the
politics and social issues of the time. But much of the pain Rivera
exacted on Kahlo is muted. The movie gives one the sense that he is
just a charming, serial womanizer.</TE>
<TE>   On this topic Taymor is defensive. She suggests that no one --
other than the artists themselves -- knows what really happened in
their relationship.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people say they are horrible -- sacred monsters," she
said. "Others say they were the most lovely, generous people. I don't
think you have a right to tear down a man's life if you were not
there, or if it wasn't your story and it didn't happen to you
personally."</TE>
<TE>   Taymor says she is more nervous about the film's reception in
Mexico than in the U.S. She is hoping the movie will be received as
authentic. Taymor says she has always been attracted to stories set
in mythic or foreign lands. "I don't make movies in New York City. I
don't make art about New Yorkers. I don't identify. I watch 'Sex and
the City' and go, 'What foreign country is that?' I feel much more
connected in Oaxaca."</TE>

<LD>From the Leonis Adobe in Calabasas (City of Los Angeles
Historic-Cultural Monument No. 1) to the Canoga Park branch library
(No. 700), the oldest and most significant buildings in Los Angeles
are listed and pictured in the new book "Landmark L.A."</LD>
<LD>   Published jointly by the city and Angel City Press, the paperback
volume (priced at $19.95) is the first published update of the city's
historic list in eight years, and the first time the list has been
packaged for sale to the public.</LD>
<LD>   This version features a wealth of black-and-white photographs,
some documenting familiar sights like City Hall and the Central
Library building downtown, some revealing half-forgotten landmarks
like the old Uplifters Clubhouse in West L.A. and the S.S. Catalina
(once a ferryboat between San Pedro and Catalina, now apparently sunk
off Ensenada).</LD>
<TE>   "One of the things we wanted to do in this book is call attention
to the fact that these landmarks don't just perpetuate themselves.
These things disappear, even with landmark status," said Jeffrey
Herr, editor of the book and arts manager in the city Cultural
Affairs Department.</TE>
<TE>   Some elements in the 496-page guide may give traditionalists pause
-- the jauntily tilted photos, for instance, and the liberal use of
red ink -- but the geographical format makes neighborhood browsing
easy, and the brief descriptions in back often offer a tantalizing
window onto local history.</TE>
<TE>   And the index's tally of monument types may say something about
the city too: 34 theaters, 17 libraries, 65 Craftsman-style buildings
and 15 Victorians.</TE>
<TE>   For a similar view of the area's public artworks, consult the
Balcony Press' new release, "Urban Surprises: A Guide to Public Art
in Los Angeles." That paperback (110 pages; $14.95) details projects
sponsored by city and county agencies, from Metropolitan
Transportation Authority subway stops to the Community Development
Agency's downtown works. The book includes seven maps and 18 color
photos.</TE>

<LD>The battle for the choral audience at the Orange County Performing
Arts Center has a de facto winner. William Hall stepped down last
Sunday after 47 years of leading the William Hall Master Chorale,
leaving the field clear for the Pacific Chorale. The two groups have
been fighting for a share of the small choral audience for years.</LD>
<LD>   They considered merging in 1988, but the issue of who would lead
the combined group scuttled the idea.</LD>
<LD>   Each side wanted its own director: Hall, who merged his
Pasadena-based Hall Chorale with the Master Chorale of Orange County
in 1989, or John Alexander, who has led the Pacific since 1971.</LD>
<TE>   Hall's chorale will remain a resident arts organization at Chapman
University in Orange, where it moved in 2000, but under a new name
and new leadership. The Pacific Chorale's next concert at the center
will be a baroque program on Oct. 27.</TE>

<LD>Architects and acousticians are natural enemies who often fight like
cats and dogs over priorities between design and sound. Not so, by
all accounts, the music-loving architect Frank O. Gehry and
architecture-aficionado acoustician Yasuhisa Toyota, who have been
collaborating on the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Still, Gehry
sheepishly admits that he recently did something that upset Toyota.</LD>
<LD>   With the scaffolding coming down inside the Walt Disney Concert
Hall, Gehry says he couldn't stand the suspense a moment longer. Late
one night last month, he called up Los Angeles Philharmonic music
director Esa-Pekka Salonen and asked him if he wanted to do something
they weren't supposed to do.</LD>
<LD>   Salonen said yes.</LD>
<TE>   They then called the Philharmonic's concertmaster, Martin
Chalifour, and asked him to meet them at the hall with his violin.</TE>
<TE>   The interior is still in rough form, with neither the stage built
nor seats installed. But they had Chalifour stand as close as
possible to where the stage will be and play. Gehry and Salonen
listened from the rear of the hall.</TE>
<TE>   Gehry acknowledges that he has no idea how much you can tell at
this point about what the hall ultimately will sound like, but he
says that he was so floored by the immediacy and beauty of the first
music made in it that his eyes welled up in tears. He turned to
Salonen and saw that the conductor had tears in his eyes as well.</TE>
<TE>   So why would Toyota be upset when Gehry told him the good news? He
wanted to be there too.</TE>
<TE>   And what if the sonic immediacy doesn't survive the completion of
the interior? "I've made a mental note of its present state," Gehry
says, "so I'll have an idea of what we should tear down."</TE>

<LD>Sick of solo shows? Looking for a modern-day equivalent of the
vaudevillian hook?</LD>
<LD>   In "Easy Targets," at the Actor's Lab Theatre in Hollywood, six
soloists tread the boards only to become the targets of rolled-up
socks hurled by bored audience members. The socks are rented on the
premises -- four for $1, and strolling sock vendors keep a fresh
supply of projectiles available.</LD>
<LD>   The titles of the six hapless performances: "All About Me," "Hi
Dad, I'm Gay," "An Evening With Abraham Lincoln," "Just Clownin'
Around," "Yes I Can, Sir" and "What Did I Say? A Field Guide to the
Female of the Species" -- each representing a different, well-worn
solo genre.</LD>
<TE>   The writers and performers are the Burglars of Hamm, the troupe
that earlier spoofed academic theater in "Resa Fantastiskt Mystisk."</TE>
<TE>   No one is performing his or her own material -- "we wanted to give
each other material that's impossible and humiliating to perform,"
said resident director Matt Almos.</TE>

<HD>Renovation in progress</HD>
<DH>At 73, Frank Gehry faces the challenge of trying to avoid
the formulaic and to stretch his architectural vision yet again.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nicolai Ouroussoff</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a celebrity-obsessed age, Frank Gehry has attained a stature that
would make Andy Warhol quiver with jealousy.</LD>
<LD>   Since the runaway success of his design for the Guggenheim Museum
in Bilbao, Spain, completed five years ago, Gehry has become one of
the world's most recognizable cultural figures. His buildings --
raucous explosions of shimmering metal -- have become the dominant
image of contemporary architecture, more familiar, perhaps, than the
earlier landmarks of Frank Lloyd Wright.</LD>
<LD>   That familiarity has landed Gehry a wealth of commissions. His
Weatherhead School of Management building at Case Western Reserve
University was dedicated Wednesday in Cleveland. A
430,000-square-foot Computer Science complex for the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology is under construction in Cambridge, as is his
much-anticipated Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. And he is
working on a hotel and conference center in Venice, Italy; a major
addition to the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington; and the Museum
of Biodiversity in Panama City, Panama.</LD>
<TE>   With so much public adulation focused on him, one might expect
Gehry to retreat into self-absorption, or to simply churn out
formulaic buildings in an effort to appease the demands of a ravenous
market. If not all of these works measure up to the standards set by
Bilbao, who can blame him? The market is unlikely to notice.</TE>
<TE>   But there is increasing evidence that, at 73, Gehry has not yet
reached the point of creative exhaustion. In September, he purchased
a Venice lot where he plans to build a new home for himself and his
family. The move would mean abandoning the Santa Monica house that
has stood at the center of his architectural identity for decades.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, many of his recent projects suggest a desire to
stretch the boundaries of his aesthetic vision. In the Panama design,
for example, Gehry's typically exuberant forms have been replaced by
a more delicate aesthetic of folding planes.</TE>
<TE>   Such changes may reflect a desire to wiggle free of unwanted
expectations. But they are also more personal. They are rooted in a
need to break away from creative constraints -- something that has
always lain at the core of Gehry's art. And they point toward a new
chapter in Gehry's life, the third and final act in a long and
prolific career.</TE>
<TE>   "I sometimes think of Matisse," he said recently. "When I was
younger, I loved his line drawings. And when I saw the cutouts he was
making at the end of his life, it made me sad. I thought, here's this
arthritic man reduced to making paper-doll cutouts. Now I realize
that he used his problems, the physical deficiencies he was facing,
and blasted forward."</TE>
<TE>   A subtle shift in values</TE>
<TE>   Most architects spend their lives honing a single vision. Mies van
der Rohe -- a giant of the Modernist tradition -- revolutionized the
profession by refining a relatively limited palette of glass and
steel.</TE>
<TE>   Gehry can claim two major breakthroughs in his career. The first
came at age 49, when, after years of frustration designing relatively
conventional buildings for local developers, he bought and began
remodeling his Santa Monica house. At the time, many architects were
trying to break from established Modernist dogmas. Gehry's answer was
to tear apart a banal suburban bungalow, wrapping it in a collage of
chain link, corrugated metal and exposed studs. The result was a
powerful expression of social fragmentation.</TE>
<TE>   For nearly a decade, Gehry expanded on that theme with a series of
works whose raw, geometric forms were composed with the intensity of
a child playing with building blocks. In the 1984 Benson House in
Calabasas, for example, two banal, box-like structures were joined by
a series of bridges and decks made out of raw plywood and 2-by-4s. In
the Winton Guest House, built in Wayzata, Minn., in 1987, simple,
platonic forms -- one shaped like a chimney stack, another a simple
box -- were huddled together in an open field.</TE>
<TE>   Such projects represented more than aesthetic games. They were
colored by memories of childhood -- the working-class suburb of
Toronto where he grew up; his father's crippling stroke in 1947; and
the family's descent into poverty after it moved to L.A. Their
composition seemed to reveal the tensions hidden beneath the numbing
uniformity of suburban society.</TE>
<TE>   But by the end of the 1980s, Gehry seemed to be reaching the
limits of that vocabulary. He was now grappling with bigger
commissions, and the mostly wood-frame structures he had produced
until then could not be easily adapted to the scale of major public
works.</TE>
<TE>   Using computer software originally created to design fighter jets,
Gehry began molding industrial materials into more sculptural forms.
The first of these, the 1992 Vila Olimpica in Barcelona, Spain,
included a gigantic steel mesh fish sculpture that hovered above an
outdoor court. In the design for Disney Hall, the forms became more
integrated, with a series of petal-like layers wrapping around a
central core.</TE>
<TE>   Such works suggested a subtle shift in Gehry's core values as an
architect. If once he sought to locate aesthetic meaning in everyday
life, these later projects were more overtly sensual. Their beauty
flowed out of the muscular forms of a postindustrial landscape.</TE>
<TE>   Gehry has yet to abandon that language entirely. The Weatherhead
School of Management, for example, retains some of the imagery of
Bilbao. The building's steel roofscape spills over the main facade
like wet drapery, recalling the museum's titanium-clad skin.</TE>
<TE>   In Le Clos Jordan Winery near Toronto, the forms become more
amorphous. The design's undulating steel exterior seems to hover over
the acres of grapevines like a cloud. A series of passageways will
carve through the building, allowing light to spill into the
interiors.</TE>
<TE>   But Gehry speaks of this work as an end, not a beginning. Beneath
his sometimes gruff manor and rumpled appearance, he is mellowing.
And increasingly, he seems to be driven by a renewed sense of
introspection. He is more apt to reflect on his early experiences as
an architect, as if he is trying to correct misconceptions about the
meaning of his work -- or searching for a deeper level of truth
within it.</TE>
<TE>   To some degree, this is taking him back to an earlier language. In
his design for the Ohr-O'Keefe Museum, Gehry is creating a collection
of small, simple buildings, scattered amid a field of trees in the
heart of Biloxi, Miss.</TE>
<TE>   The buildings were inspired by local shotgun shacks built by
former slaves. They will be topped by folding, faceted roofs. Gently
propped up on wood columns, the roofs will play off the surrounding
tree canopies.</TE>
<TE>   The project's humble appearance gives it a calm, empathic quality
that is far from the aggressive sensuality of Gehry's other recent
work.</TE>
<TE>   But the project that most suggests a shift in Gehry's creative
sensibility is the Museum of Biodiversity in Panama. In the design,
still in its early stages, galleries are sheltered beneath a dense
network of overlapping roof canopies, their colorful, folded planes
evoking a cloud of butterflies that have come to rest on a tree
branch. Underneath, bridges crisscross the space to connect the
various galleries.</TE>
<TE>   In part, the uniqueness of the Panama design results from a
reorganization in the structure of Gehry's 130-person office. For
about a decade, Gehry has worked almost exclusively with two
principal project designers, Craig Webb and Edwin Chan. The
collaborations with Chan, which include Bilbao, tend toward the
flamboyant; those with Webb, who is working on the Ohr Museum, seem a
bit more restrained. Recently, however, Gehry has begun to work with
a broader range of in-house talents. Panama is the first major
project led by Anand Devarajan, who came to the firm a little more
than a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   In many of these commissions, Gehry is also touching on more
personal territory. Gehry's wife, Berta, was born in Panama, and
Gehry sometimes speaks of the museum as a gift to her native country.
Gehry's Le Clos Jordan Winery is his first major commission near
Toronto, the city where he grew up and to which he traces his
working-class identity. He recently accepted a commission to design
an addition to the Art Gallery of Ontario, which he remembers
visiting with his mother when he was a child.</TE>
<TE>   Gehry is conscious of these connections. Sitting in his office
recently, he playfully showed off a Queen's Golden Jubilee Medal he
was awarded by the Canadian government, before mentioning that it was
also sent to 46,000 other Canadians.</TE>
<TE>   "These projects are emotional things," Gehry said as he placed the
medal back on a desk cluttered with other memorabilia, including
architectural drawings by his two sons. (He also has two daughters
from a previous marriage.) "And that makes them a challenge for me."</TE>
<TE>   This seems less a nostalgic trip than a reflection of a desire to
tap into primal imaginative sources, and inevitably, it is opening
new creative veins.</TE>
<TE>   Reconnecting to earlier ideals</TE>
<TE>   It is in that context that Gehry's decision to abandon his Santa
Monica house is so revealing. Gehry built the house as a sort of
architectural manifesto. It existed as the physical expression of his
creative mission, defining his position within the profession and his
relationship to mainstream culture.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the neighborhood has become more affluent, and the
house has been celebrated as a landmark of 20th century design.
Gehry, too, has changed. He keeps a 40-foot yacht in Marina del Rey;
he drives a shiny new BMW 745i.</TE>
<TE>   The move to Venice can be read as an effort to reconnect to
earlier ideals. Flat and barren, the lot is marked by two skinny
palms and a pine tree. A row of shabby bungalows stands to the south.
Driveways are littered with old trucks and the occasional boat
trailer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a simple neighborhood," Gehry says. "So I could easily go
back to the old language of exposed studs and the Winton House. And I
don't want to do that. I'm struggling with that."</TE>
<TE>   So far, Gehry envisions a walled compound of small structures,
some rising two floors so he can catch distant views of the ocean. He
also says that he hopes to design the project with his 22-year-old
son, Sam, who recently began working for the firm. But whatever he
builds here, Gehry cannot escape the fact that it will mark a
significant chapter in the long arc of his career.</TE>
<TE>   The pressures of such a task are daunting. Aldous Huxley once
described Francisco Goya's life as a "growth away from restraint and
into freedom, away from timidity and into expressive boldness."
Gehry's odyssey has followed a similar course. What he may be seeking
now is a new set of constraints -- the kind of inner tension that
could once again spark his imagination.</TE>
<TE>   It is too soon to know whether that struggle will pay off. But the
process of reinvention, in itself, is an act of daring. It requires a
willingness to venture onto unstable ground, both creative and
psychological. And ultimately, that may be more important than
whether or not he fails.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   A career in three acts</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Act 1: Fractured forms</TE>
<TE>   Gehry first came to prominence in 1978, with the design of his
Santa Monica house, and the next few years were some of the most
fertile of his career. Projects such as the Winton Guest House in
Wayzata, Minn., and the Norton House in Venice, Calif., were crude,
box-like structures that often seemed torn apart by internal forces.
Stud walls were left exposed; simple forms crashed together at odd
angles.</TE>
<TE>   Act 2: Metallurgist</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s, Gehry began experimenting with more fluid, sensuous
forms, mostly in metal. The most famous of these is the Guggenheim
Museum in Bilbao, Spain, whose curvaceous exterior, clad in
shimmering titanium panels, caused an international sensation. In Los
Angeles, Disney Hall's layered metal skin has been likened to a rose
in bloom. Other works, such as the DZ Bank Building in Berlin,
internalized this energy, embedding similarly curvaceous forms in a
more stoic exterior.</TE>
<TE>   Act 3: Homeward</TE>
<TE>   In the past few years, Gehry has been striving to create new
aesthetic challenges for himself. His Ohr-O'Keefe Museum, in Biloxi,
Miss., still in design stages, marks a partial return to a language
he mostly abandoned a decade ago. A current design for the Museum of
Biodiversity in Panama creates a new formal imagery of folding,
overlapping planes.</TE>

<HD>Design for management school is a case study in duality</HD>
<DH>Gehry's latest is awkward on the outside, mesmerizing on
the inside.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nicolai Ouroussoff</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>Cleveland</DL>
<LD>The Weatherhead School of Management's new Peter B. Lewis Building at
Case Western University, which was dedicated Wednesday, is an
imperfect building.</LD>
<LD>   Designed by Frank Gehry, its undulating stainless-steel-and-brick
exterior lacks the taut energy of his best works. But once you get by
these flaws, its sensuous forms draw you into a dreamlike world that
packs an erotic charge.</LD>
<LD>   The squat, four-story building, which houses classrooms and
offices, stands at the corner of Bellflower Road and Ford Drive, a
main intersection of the university campus. The building is clad in
brick on three sides. Gehry's trademark stainless-steel forms spill
out of the top of this base, unraveling over the main facade like
ribbon candy. A cafe peeks out from underneath a curved metal canopy,
facing the main strip. Another panel peels back to reveal the main
corner entry.</LD>
<TE>   The brick is meant to echo the more conventional facades of the
surrounding buildings. Instead, the composition feels messy. Its
brick surfaces bulge and bend, blending into the steel. The tension
one expects -- between hard and soft materials -- is missing.</TE>
<TE>   Once you slip inside, however, that awkwardness is quickly
forgotten. A soaring atrium carves up through the building, framed by
the offices and classrooms on four sides. The atrium is dominated by
two vaguely cylindrical white forms that house the main lecture
halls. Dubbed the "two Buddhas," their swollen silhouettes, propped
up on heavy canted columns, seem locked in a gentle dance.</TE>
<TE>   It is a mesmerizing effect. Light filters down through skylights,
animating their surfaces. And as you move up through the space, you
circle around these central volumes in a world of increasing
intimacy. Views open between the forms; communal lounge areas are
tucked into unexpected corners. But the center remains inaccessible
-- a void. And even as you enter one of the two atrium forms, you
take with you the lingering memory of the other.</TE>
<TE>   That sense of displacement seeps into the mind like a subliminal
message. It tells us that life takes place on the periphery, in the
cracks and crevices of our existence. And it forces us into a private
realm where a more meaningful exchange of ideas can take place. Not a
bad lesson for a school.</TE>

<LD>The lyrics: "I'm the strawberry, lonely without cream. Banana is my
smoothie, you taste like a dream. Sourness is beyond you, gotta get
my paws on you. You ain't seen nothing yet, orange you glad we met?"</LD>
<LD>   The song: "Get Your Juices Going"</LD>
<LD>   Where it's charting: Currently, No. 44 on the Australian pop
lists, after hitting No. 28.</LD>
<TE>   The artists: Starburst, whose members, for reasons that will
become apparent, would prefer not to divulge their identities.</TE>
<TE>   The back story: In this installment of "global stealth marketing
at work," advertising firm D'Arcy Australia decides to try slipping a
catchy jingle for Starburst candy onto the radio waves -- without
revealing that lines such as "I'm the strawberry" are meant to be
taken more or less literally. The song winds up with high-rotation
airplay, supported by a video featuring candy-colored models and
spinning segments of fruit. The project's origins -- it's a
commercial! -- are revealed in a Starburst TV ad with the tagline:
"You've bought the song, now buy the lollies."</TE>
<TE>   What the principals say about the work: "If anyone knew it formed
part of an ad campaign, no one would have taken it seriously,"
acknowledged Mark Collis of D'Arcy, whose writers supplied the song's
lyrics. Adds Dan Bessant, music director of Nova-FM, which liked the
tune and ran with it: "For us, it comes down to how the song sounds.
It's a bit of fun. It's catchy." And, not coincidentally, a sweet
deal for the candymen.</TE>

<HD>Labels' top priority: leak prevention</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Hochman</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Advance copies of Faith Hill's new "Cry" album sent by Warner Bros.
Records to journalists, retailers and radio programmers included a
"watermark" encoded into the disc that identifies each person a copy
was sent to. The discs also came with a stern letter from a company
lawyer warning recipients not to copy the music or make it available
on the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   When Epic Records sent out advances of forthcoming albums by Pearl
Jam, Tori Amos and AudioSlave, they were sealed into CD Walkmans with
superglue, with the headphones also cemented in so the player
couldn't be hooked up to another device.</LD>
<LD>   How did it work?</LD>
<TE>   The Hill CD is all over the Internet. So are the Pearl Jam, Amos
and AudioSlave albums.</TE>
<TE>   So what now?</TE>
<TE>   It's one of the hottest questions in the music business, both in
terms of determining what other security measures can be taken, and
what action ought to be taken against those responsible for the
breaches.</TE>
<TE>   On the latter, opinions vary greatly.</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros. sources confirm that they have identified the source
of the Hill leak and that legal action for copyright violation is
being considered against a journalist. Epic too knows the identities
of those responsible for its leaks and is cutting them off from
advance access to music.</TE>
<TE>   "Our first step is to contact the individual or company that
engaged in the unauthorized distribution of the music to ensure that
they understand the gravity of the matter and that they will
institute appropriate measures to prevent it from happening in the
future," says Will Tanous, vice president of corporate communications
for Warner Music Group, the parent company of Warner Bros. Records.
"Beyond that, there are a variety of legal measures that can be
taken.... We take these matters very seriously, and we expect our
business partners to do the same."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a variety of other methods to prevent leaks are being
tested.</TE>
<TE>   MCA has made the upcoming album by Sigur Ros available to press
only via a password-protected Web site, where the music can be heard,
but not downloaded. George Harrison's "Brainwashed" has thus far only
been available for listening in sessions at Capitol Records' offices,
with the CD brought in by Harrison's sister-in-law and then taken
away by her at the session's end. Not even executives at Capitol or
its parent, EMI Music, have been trusted with copies.</TE>
<TE>   That makes it very difficult on those charged with promotion and
publicity.</TE>
<TE>   "How do we get the music to [journalists]?" said one major-label
publicist, who asked not to be named in this story. "We want them to
hear the music. But when we traced a leak, it went back to a
journalist. Whoever can come up with the solution, whatever it is, is
going to be a wealthy person."</TE>
<TE>   -- Steve Hochman</TE>
<TE>   Small faces</TE>
<TE>   Atlantic Records is making the heaviest major-label commitment yet
to reggae dancehall music, in a joint venture deal with New
York-based VP Records. VP is the home of singer Sean Paul, whose song
"Gimme the Light" is a fast-rising hit on both the pop and
R&amp;B/hip-hop charts. Paul's album, "Dutty Rock," will be released Nov.
12, with albums by Bounty Killer, Tanto Metro &amp; Devonte and T.O.K. to
follow. Atlantic co-president Craig Kallman cites the edgy style's
influence in contemporary hip-hop and sees its role at Atlantic
potentially comparable to what '70s reggae was at Island Records, the
home of Bob Marley.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the Holiday," a new song by Westside Connection featuring
Rama Duke, will lead off the soundtrack to the Christmas-themed urban
comedy "Friday After Next," written and directed by Ice Cube. Also on
the album, due from Hollywood Records Nov. 19, are previously
unreleased tracks by Swizz Beats featuring Nas, Flipmode Squad
featuring Busta Rhymes and Krayzie Bone.</TE>
<TE>   FischerSpooner, the New York electroclash act known for its
elaborately theatrical concerts, has signed a U.S. contract with
Capitol Records after a deal fell through that would have given MCA
Records the rights to U.S. distribution of product from
FischerSpooner's U.K. label, Ministry of Sound. On Feb. 11, Capitol
is scheduled to release a new version of the group's album, "#1,"
with new material added.</TE>

<DH>Real women talk: Breasts. Thighs. The cult of thinness.
Their new movie.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lorenza Munoz</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Newcomer America Ferrera and veteran Lupe Ontiveros star as mother
and daughter in "Real Women Have Curves," which won several awards at
Sundance this year and will be released Friday. When we caught up
with them, they'd just returned from the San Sebastian International
Film Festival in Spain.</LD>
<LD>   In the film, your relationship is pretty contentious, yet in real
life you get along so well. Was it tough switching back and forth?</LD>
<LD>   Ontiveros:  I'm the kind of actor that walks away from the
character once I have done it. If I have to be distasteful to her, I
do it at the time it is called upon. If I would have been nasty to
her in real life, she is a young lady and impressionable, and she
would have been uncomfortable with me. I would kid her, call her
gordita [little fat one] now and then. She was short like me, and we
are both big-boobed -- that was a requirement -- and rebellious, so
she was perfect.</LD>
<TE>   Ferrera: Our relationship off screen is what made the relationship
on screen work. We trusted each other. We tested each other to see
how far we could go.</TE>
<TE>   This movie is about celebrating women with plenty of meat on their
bones. Are you sending a message to all the girls reading Vogue,
thinking they have to look like Kate Moss?</TE>
<TE>   Ontiveros: I think to some degree we have to break those barriers
and say, "Be who you are in spite of cultural, religious barriers in
front of you." I live life to the fullest. But there is a certain
behavior seniors have to follow because of the attitude in this
country toward age.</TE>
<TE>   In Europe and Latin America people who are middle-aged are
respected. Here, if you go to a nightclub people look at you saying,
"What are you doing here? You should be in a retirement home." In
Spain ... the DJ [in the nightclub] remembered me because I had gone
there so many times.</TE>
<TE>   Ferrera: [The obsession with youth and being thin] is so apparent
in our society. It's in everything we do. The magazines we read, the
diet pills, the exercise machines, the clothes we buy. It's like a
cult where we are encouraging everybody to look the same and think
the same.</TE>
<TE>   Ontiveros: We are a product of the malicious culture that has set
itself on young ladies because of the image that is portrayed in
films and magazines. Like the Britney Spears look. If she were
chunky, would she be as popular as she is? Everything has to do with
inhibitions -- maybe they are not taboos, but they do tell you do not
take your clothes off unless you have something beautiful to show.</TE>
<TE>   America, tell me about filming the scene where you strip down to
your underwear and bra at work ...</TE>
<TE>   Ferrera: Exactly what the audience feels, that is what I felt. At
first they are scared. They think, "What are you doing?" But then
they have fun. At first I was looking at myself from the outside. It
was nerve-racking at first, but then we had a great time. I saw
myself with different eyes and a greater appreciation of myself. When
you watch the scene, the bodies are the last things you look at....
You see people. It's a celebration.</TE>

<LD>Faith Hill</LD>
<LD>   "Cry"</LD>
<LD>   * 1/2, Warner Bros. Nashville</LD>
<TE>   Memo to Warner Bros. Nashville Records: Thanks for the advance of
the new Faith Hill album. You must be looking for some feedback
before signing off on it, right? I can understand why. Faith's last
album sold 8 million copies, but someone needs to talk to her about
this record. "Cry" is so filled with vocal histrionics that it
borders on the unlistenable.</TE>
<TE>   No one should blame Faith for not wanting to be Loretta Lynn and
Tammy Wynette. But why did she want to be Celine Dion? There are
brilliant singers -- Emmylou Harris, Shelby Lynne and Alison Krauss
-- who have moved beyond traditional country without sacrificing
their soulful edge.</TE>
<TE>   With regard to "Cry," you should start by scrapping tracks 3, 5,
6, 7, 10, 12 and 13. The songs (mostly overwrought power ballads) are
mediocre, her vocals are rarely convincing, and the arrangements are
ham-fisted. The material is promising enough elsewhere to salvage the
tracks by bringing in some advisors. Alanis Morissette could help
Faith and the band convey some true romantic fury in the title tune;
Lucinda Williams could suggest ways to achieve the lonely barroom
ache needed in "When the Lights Go Down"; and Beck could show the way
to the vulnerability aimed for in "Stronger."</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe you could just have Faith and her team go back into the
studio and simply study the album's one truly outstanding track:
"You're Still Here," a tender, intimate reflection on how someone's
spirit stays with you even after the person passes out of your life.
Faith sings it with touching restraint that makes the rest of the
album seem all the more jarring.</TE>
<TE>   You do have time to rethink this album, right? What's that? It's
coming out Tuesday? Oh my.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Hilburn</TE>
<TE>   From under</TE>
<TE>   the clouds</TE>
<TE>   Tracy Chapman</TE>
<TE>   "Let It Rain"</TE>
<TE>   ***, Elektra</TE>
<TE>   Tracy Chapman is the poster woman for a zero-tolerance policy on
unhealthy relationships. So what's going on in "You're the One"?
"Some say you're bitter / Think you're mean ..." she sings. "I think
you're sensitive and sweet / Stay as you are don't change a thing."
It's almost Randy Newman-esque in turning romantic conventional
wisdom inside out.</TE>
<TE>   An emotional cloud envelops many of the songs in Chapman's
powerfully dark sixth album, as lovers often fall just short of
fulfillment ("Almost") or confront their ignoble side ("In the
Dark"). The downcast tone -- almost existential in its gloom -- on
the surface is heightened by Chapman and co-producer John Parish's
sonic touches from the Tom Waits back-alley-at-2 a.m. school.</TE>
<TE>   That mood is leavened periodically by a gospel-music solace, which
is most pronounced in the spare and swinging minor-key "Say
Hallelujah," which revisits the age-old theme that there'll be joy in
the afterlife because there sure isn't much in this one.</TE>
<TE>   Chapman is musing on the fine art of acceptance when life doesn't
turn out the way we hope: "So far from perfection, not truth or
transcendence will set you free." She ends with "I Am Yours," with
more resignation than celebration of faith in love's ability to make
things OK, if not necessarily different.</TE>
<TE>   -- Randy Lewis</TE>
<TE>   More songs for social change</TE>
<TE>   Various artists</TE>
<TE>   "Red Hot + Riot:</TE>
<TE>   The Music of Fela Kuti"</TE>
<TE>   ***, MCA</TE>
<TE>   This is the 14th album released by the Red Hot organization to
promote AIDS prevention, and none has done a better job of matching
the artist with the concept, the music with newly conceived
interpretations. Fela, who died in 1997 of AIDS complications, was
one of the first African superstars to aggressively speak out about
social inequities, often triggering violent reaction by the Nigerian
government against him, his family and his associates.</TE>
<TE>   Songs such as "Zombie" and "Shuffering and Shmiling" -- both
included in this collection -- are compelling examples of the
penetrating manner in which the bandleader addressed social issues.
Fela was also one of Africa's most determinedly contemporary artists,
with the funk-driven spontaneity of his live performances deeply
tapping into the changing cultural landscape.</TE>
<TE>   So it's appropriate that his music is interpreted here in
similarly contemporary fashion by a lineup of artists eclectic enough
to include Sade, Macy Gray (with Roy Hargrove), Meshell Ndegeocello,
D'Angelo, Nile Rodgers, Archie Shepp, Baaba Maal and Fela's
supercharged son, Femi Kuti. In the process, this valuable collection
affirms Fela's importance as a performer, an artist and a catalyst
for social change.</TE>
<TE>   -- Don Heckman</TE>
<TE>   In brief</TE>
<TE>   Uncle Kracker</TE>
<TE>   "No Stranger to Shame"</TE>
<TE>   ***, Lava</TE>
<TE>   He's got all the Southern-fried charm and funky infectiousness
that made Kid Rock a superstar, but Uncle Kracker's laid-back
libations, while simple by comparison, go down a lot more smoothly.
The new one from Rock's DJ and co-songwriter is less rap-driven than
his hit debut, "Double Wide," but it still oozes with groove-filled
hooks. Though wistful, country-tinged ditties including "In a Little
While" and a spot-on version of Dobie Gray's "Drift Away" (with Gray
a guest on vocals) don't take any chances, they've got a soulful
sweetness that's nothing to be ashamed of.</TE>
<TE>   -- Lina Lecaro</TE>
<TE>   Bon Jovi</TE>
<TE>   "Bounce"</TE>
<TE>   **, Island Def Jam</TE>
<TE>   Another Jersey boy's latest album is touched by Sept. 11, mostly
in the mournful defiance of "Undivided" and the embrace-life rocker
"Everyday." Though cliched, these and the resilient title anthem are
hooky and sincere, which is highly preferable to the lunkheaded,
romantic-to-inspirational ballads that dominate the album. This time
the music's trademark epic quality comes less from Richie Sambora's
sprawling guitar work than from an overdose of strings and piano that
reflects singer-actor Jon Bon Jovi's movie and TV interests. But
what's really howl-worthy is the unintentionally hilarious "Right
Side of Wrong," a dead-serious, Springsteen-esque tale of desperate
outlaws that redefines "hokey."</TE>
<TE>   -- Natalie Nichols</TE>
<TE>   Miguel Migs</TE>
<TE>   "Colorful You"</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2, Naked Music/Astralwerks</TE>
<TE>   In the pop world, this Northern California producer-DJ could be a
hit-making machine along the lines of Jimmy Jam &amp; Terry Lewis.
Instead, Migs is one of the fastest-rising acts in the dance music
world. On "Colorful You," he displays a dazzling gift for melody and
soul, evidenced by the Sade-esque "Waiting" and the R&amp;B vibe of
"Brand New Day." For a dance collection, "Colorful You" may be the
best neo-soul record of the year.</TE>
<TE>   -- Steve Baltin</TE>
<TE>   Amon Tobin</TE>
<TE>   "Out From out Where"</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2, Ninja Tune</TE>
<TE>   Like the label he's represented for four albums now, this Brit via
Brazil loves to toy with the boundaries of electronic music. He
believes any sound is fair game for his sampler, and "Out From out
Where" is marked by an atmospheric sense of melody and a playfulness
throughout. Unlike some tech heads, Tobin realizes his music can be
cerebral without losing its sense of humor.</TE>
<TE>   -- S.B.</TE>
<TE>   Hot Hot Heat</TE>
<TE>   "Make Up the Breakdown"</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2, SubPop</TE>
<TE>   This frenetic foursome from Victoria, Canada, presides over a
colossal jousting match between synths and guitars that is liable to
leave its audience breathless. It's as if Hot Hot Heat, which
performs Wednesday at Spaceland, has imprisoned 10 punk songs in
myriad dance rhythms. With Steve Bays' faux-tortured vocals (Robert
Smith on antidepressants?) providing the narration, listeners might
want to rage, or they might want to disco. Or maybe both.</TE>

<TE>   Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair),
three stars (good) and four stars (excellent). The albums are already
released unless otherwise noted.</TE>

<DH>Friends and relatives want to mourn in a setting that
reminds them of the dearly departed, so mortuaries are getting
personal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Roy Rivenburg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Except for the coffin, it looks like an ordinary kitchen. A steaming
kettle sits on the stove and the smell of brownies wafts through the
air.</LD>
<LD>   The scene is part of a St. Louis mortuary that is trying to
reinvent modern funerals by replacing traditional chapel decor with
themed sets reflecting the deceased's hobbies. Elsewhere on the
premises, caskets have been parked next to a fake bowling alley,
makeshift movie theater and a small pond brimming with catfish and a
sign that says, "Gone fishing."</LD>
<LD>   The idea is to create more meaningful send-offs for the dearly
departed. "Instead of cookie-cutter funerals, this helps the family
celebrate what the person was all about," says Aaron Grimes, Wade
Funeral Home branch manager.</LD>
<TE>   "People want something unique," agrees Michael Kubasak, a Burbank
mortician who helped pioneer themed burials by installing a boxing
ring in his chapel for the 1988 funeral of a fighter.</TE>
<TE>   Coffin manufacturers are also getting in on the act. For instance,
hunters can now be laid to rest in caskets lined with
camouflage-colored fabric. And the Batesville Casket Co. of Indiana
recently introduced a line of small sculptures that attach to the
corners of coffins. The figurines include golf clubs, flowerpots, a
big-mouthed bass and "the Angel of Color" (an African American
version of the company's popular white-angel statuette).</TE>
<TE>   Cremated ashes can spend eternity inside special birdbaths, wind
chimes, duck decoys and maybe even Frisbees. Before his death in
August, Ed Headrick, the man who invented Frisbee golf and added
grooved ridges to Wham-O's famous disc, asked to have his ashes mixed
into a new batch of Frisbees. His family plans to honor the request.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he wanted to end up in a Frisbee that accidentally lands
on someone's roof," his son told the San Francisco Chronicle.</TE>
<TE>   The rise in personalized send-offs is fueled by baby boomers. The
generation that dumped traditional wedding ceremonies in favor of
nuptials at the beach or aboard hot-air balloons is now taking aim at
funeral customs, Kubasak says. Joe Weigel, a spokesman for
Batesville, agrees: "In the mid-1990s, we started hearing from a new
type of consumer. They wanted something more individualized."</TE>
<TE>   At a 1999 funeral directors convention, Batesville displayed
coffins in elaborate dioramas themed for farmers, jazz musicians,
gardeners and hunters. When Wade Funeral Home officials eyed the
displays, they took the idea and ran with it.</TE>
<TE>   In one case, for a barbecue-themed service, Wade staffers put a
chunk of dry ice inside a Weber-style grill so smoke would billow out
whenever someone lifted the lid. They also hid a microwave oven in
the next room and periodically nuked a rib sandwich for authentic
barbecue aroma. Lawn furniture and umbrellas completed the scene.</TE>
<TE>   For a movie buff's visitation service, Wade rented a big-screen
TV, draped black fabric around the sides to mimic theater curtains,
microwaved some buttered popcorn and plopped down three rows of old
wooden seats next to the coffin. A VCR played the deceased's favorite
film, "The Color Purple."</TE>
<TE>   "People were actually sitting in the chairs, eating the popcorn
and watching the movie," says Grimes, whose imaginative props have
earned him the nickname "Mr. Disney" at the funeral parlor. "That
tells you how relaxed the sets make guests feel."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly half of Wade's customers now opt for themed visitations or
funerals, which are offered at no extra charge. The concept has been
such a smash that Wade's parent company, Tucson-based Perpetua Inc.,
plans to go nationwide with it. "I want to change the face of funeral
services," says Perpetua boss Slivy Edmonds Cotton, who previously
owned an auto emission testing company. Over the next decade, she
hopes to establish a chain of 50 funeral parlors modeled after Wade.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Musgrove, an Oregon mortician who also serves as treasurer of
the National Funeral Directors Assn., says the concept of
personalized funerals is rapidly catching on. "We've had everything
from canoes to bikes to Grandma's rocking chair at our services," he
says. "One lady loved cows, so we had a tape player that mooed."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most legendary send-off took place at Burbank's Valley
Funeral Home. To memorialize a former prizefighter, Kubasak rented a
portable boxing ring, set it up in the chapel with a microphone and
invited guests to step into the ring to deliver eulogies. At the end
of the service, Kubasak clanged a bell 10 times.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't his first such effort. Kubasak had been dabbling in
personalized funerals since the late 1970s. "I've been saying for
years that the funeral home of the future isn't going to look
anything like what we have today," he says.</TE>
<TE>   If so, St. Louis' Wade Funeral Home could be a harbinger. The
mortuary's first themed chapel, which debuted in mid-2001, was a
Victorian-style parlor with flowered wallpaper and antique chairs.
"It's a throwback to the days when visitations were held at the
person's home," Cotton says.</TE>
<TE>   Next came a sports-themed room, with recliner, TV remote,
basketball hoop, posters, fishing pond and a TV playing a tape of
dad's favorite games.</TE>
<TE>   The fake kitchen followed. "I was a little skeptical when they
first told me that idea," Cotton admits. "I said, 'You're going to
put a casket next to a stove and refrigerator?' But when I saw it, I
was blown away."</TE>
<TE>   Dubbed Big Momma's Kitchen, it immediately became Wade's most
popular room. Angela Clay of St. Louis rented the kitchen in March,
after her mother died. "When I saw it, I had to have it," she
recalls. "My mother loved to cook and play cards."</TE>
<TE>   At the visitation, guests sat around a dining table next to the
casket, playing cards and eating little pies set out by Wade's staff.
Clay, who had buried her father two years earlier at a traditional
service, says the themed room eased the grieving: "With my father, it
was just sad. But [with Big Momma's Kitchen], people were playing
cards and talking; there wasn't a lot of boo-hooing. The memories
were better."</TE>

<KH>MEDIA MATTERS / DAVID SHAW</KH>
<HD>Grim season for alternatives with the fall of New Times</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID SHAW</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When New Times, the feisty alternative weekly, shut down a couple of
weeks ago, I first learned of it when I overheard a conversation
between two colleagues at The Times -- precisely the way I learned,
40 years earlier, of a similar deal between two competing publishers
that also left Los Angeles with fewer media voices.</LD>
<LD>   I was in college, working part time at The Times on Jan. 6, 1962,
the day Times Mirror, then the parent company of The Times, announced
it was closing its afternoon paper, the Mirror; simultaneously, the
rival Hearst Corp. folded its morning paper, the Examiner. That would
leave The Times alone in the morning, and Hearst's Herald-Express --
to be re-christened the Herald Examiner -- alone in the afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   How convenient -- how lucrative -- especially for The Times.
Afternoon newspapers were a rapidly dying breed. A morning monopoly
was like a license to print money. Sure enough, the Herald Examiner
struggled and ultimately folded while The Times thrived.</LD>
<TE>   Flash-forward to October 2002. The Phoenix-based New Times chain
of 12 alternative weeklies announces that it's closing Los Angeles
New Times, leaving LA Weekly, owned by Village Voice Media of New
York, as our only alternative paper. Simultaneously, Village Voice
Media announces that it's closing Cleveland Free Times, leaving its
rival, Cleveland New Times, as the sole alternative weekly in that
city.</TE>
<TE>   "This transaction," said David Schneiderman, chief executive of
Village Voice Media, "is consistent with the strategic direction of
the company. We feel strongly about the markets we are in and will
continue to grow the company, both internally and through
acquisitions."</TE>
<TE>   "Strategic direction"? "Grow the company"? "Acquisitions"? It's
impossible for me to imagine any of those words or phrases being
uttered by the pioneers of the alternative press movement -- people
like Norman Mailer, Dan Wolf and Ed Fancher, who founded the Village
Voice in 1955; Art Kunkin, who started the Los Angeles Free Press in
1964; and Bruce Brugmann, who created the Bay Guardian in San
Francisco in 1966.</TE>
<TE>   Their mission was political, not commercial. However, much of
today's alternative press has "an antipathy toward all things
political," says Kit Rachlis, editor of Los Angeles magazine, who was
previously an editor at The Times and the Village Voice and was
editor in chief of LA Weekly from 1989 to 1993.</TE>
<TE>   The alternative newspaper movement -- founded amid idealism,
independence and political activism -- is today often more Pogo than
Che: "We have met the enemy and he is us."</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly dominated by large, profit-driven corporations, the
118 members of the Assn. of Alternative Weeklies generate,
cumulatively, about a half-billion dollars in advertising sales
annually; about half those papers are not independent but function as
part of some larger media group.</TE>
<TE>   It's difficult to generalize about the alternative press since
some of the papers -- the Chicago Reader, Boston Phoenix and Bay
Guardian, to take just three -- are so idiosyncratic as to defy
categorization, even in this age of what Brugmann calls "Chains-R-Us"
alternative journalism.</TE>
<TE>   "But once you get into chain journalism and you start
empire-building, you take on the characteristics of the monopolizing
dailies," Brugmann says. "You get involved with bankers and venture
capitalists to get cash and then you need big, fat numbers to satisfy
them.</TE>
<TE>   "That means you tend to use the same formula everywhere because
it's cheaper, and you cover entertainment because it's cheaper -- and
that tends to squeeze out local politics."</TE>
<TE>   Even for independent alternative papers, without the bottom-line
pressures of corporate ownership, the choice of entertainment and
culture over politics reflects the times. The United States is a far
less political society than it was in the 1960s, the spiritual (and,
in many cases, the actual) birthing ground for the early alternative
weeklies. Vietnam. Civil rights. Feminism. The sexual revolution. All
spawned activist movements and divided the country.</TE>
<TE>   There are no movements or divisions of comparable intensity now.
"Hey, hey, GWB, how many terrorists did you kill today?" would lack
both rhyme and reason. But the mainstream news media have generally
not done a very good job of covering youth culture, and that's
created a large vacuum into which many alternative newspapers have
eagerly, and profitably, stepped.</TE>
<TE>   Not all, of course. At 67, Brugmann still has the Bay Guardian
attacking the San Francisco establishment from the left.</TE>
<TE>   The Bay Guardian is not alone. But politics hasn't been the
defining mission of every alternative weekly.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of today's alternative papers are quite young," says Robert
Roth, who helped found the Chicago Reader in 1971. "They didn't sell
out; they started out on a different tack."</TE>
<TE>   But neither the general drift from political confrontation to pop
culture nor the pursuit of profits is completely new to the
alternative press. The alternative weeklies have long been stuffed
with entertainment listings and ads for sexual activities in
combinations and permutations that have little to do with the battles
for peace or racial equality.</TE>
<TE>   Still, I'm sorry to see New Times disappear -- and I say that as
someone who was, on several occasions, the target of Editor Rick
Barrs' odious diatribes in his column The Finger. LA Weekly is bigger
and more solid -- more journalistically responsible -- than New Times
was. But the Los Angeles Times is big and solid and journalistically
responsible. New Times was often an irreverent gadfly, needling City
Hall, the LAPD, the Catholic Church, big land developers and -- yes
-- The Times.</TE>
<TE>   New Times was flawed, as were the Mirror, the Examiner and the
Herald Examiner when they went out of business. But The Times too is
flawed, and Los Angeles has now been deprived of another distinctive
alternative voice -- a voice we'll miss, even if it was often shrill
and sometimes irresponsible.</TE>

<HD>New look at a rare 'Whistle'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Shirley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Anyone Can Whistle" lasted only nine performances on Broadway in
1964. But the Stephen Sondheim-Arthur Laurents musical is about to be
reborn -- in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   A West Coast Ensemble production in February will mark the first
time that an authorized revision of the show will receive a full
production.</LD>
<LD>   One of the most famous of short-lived musicals, the original
production generated a cast album and a title song that became a
cabaret standard.</LD>
<TE>   The quirks of Laurents' satirical book are usually cited as the
reason the show isn't produced more often. The story traces the
efforts of the corrupt leaders of a small town to attract tourists
with a fake "miracle," and the reactions of the local mental patients
and their nurse. The last professional production in Los Angeles was
in 1986 at Dupree Studio Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   After Michael Michetti received the assignment to direct West
Coast Ensemble's revival, "I immersed myself in the script," he said,
looking for ways to clarify and strengthen the narrative. He sent the
results to Laurents and Sondheim, and received their permission to
proceed. Laurents even sent back some revisions that will be
incorporated in Michetti's version.</TE>
<TE>   Michetti reduced the original's three acts to two, cut about 10%
of the dialogue and reordered some of the musical numbers so that the
famous title song will now end the first act. His primary goal was to
emphasize the character of the nurse. In the original, he said, "the
protagonist and the primary plot points rarely intersect."</TE>
<TE>   "It focused the piece more," Laurents agreed, speaking from New
York. In fact, the L.A. rewrite will be performed next year in
London, he said. Laurents once prepared his own trimmed version for a
concert reading.</TE>
<TE>   Laurents said he won't see the production in L.A., which he
regards as a company town for the movie industry, "not my favorite
city."</TE>

<LD>BY 10 o'clock, the line outside the Hollywood club Nacional snaked
around the block and security guards grew hoarse screaming at the
crowd. "We're not going to let anyone in unless you step back!"
shouted Laura Sosin of Lions Gate Films, holding a thick guest list.
Security guards chimed in behind her: "Back up! Back up!"</LD>
<LD>   The after-party celebrating the Oct. 3 premiere of Lions Gate
Films' new picture, "The Rules of Attraction," was the evening's hot
ticket.</LD>
<LD>   "Let them in! Let them in!" shouted Sosin as actor James Van Der
Beek and his entourage of about 12 exited a limo. Behind him, actress
Jessica Biel slinked by. Actors Heath Ledger and Kip Pardue were
right behind her, accompanied by about 20 people, including actress
Brittany Murphy, a tiny young woman wearing the platinum 'do and
glittering sheath of 1930s screen sirens. Actor Joel Michaely shouted
into a cell phone: "Bring the limo to the front and we'll pull you
out!"</LD>
<TE>   Inside, people stood elbow-to-elbow, precariously balancing
martini glasses and shouting above the DJ's music. Murphy was
immediately surrounded by photographers, who closed in as she obliged
them by striking several provocative poses. Nearby, actress Kate
Bosworth chatted with a friend. A ponytailed Val Kilmer reluctantly
ended up in a few shots, then made a quick getaway.</TE>
<TE>   Around 11 p.m., "Rules" director Roger Avary stood near the door,
torn between leaving to find his mother and waiting to see if she
could get into the party on her own.</TE>
<TE>   "If I leave they won't let me back in will they?" he asked a
publicist.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a valid concern," she answered.</TE>
<TE>   He chuckled and said: "It's like 'Day of the Locusts.' "</TE>

<LD>Jazz has not often served as the vehicle for inspirational or
spiritual ideas -- at least not in an overt, literal sense. Most jazz
listeners (and musicians, for that matter), though, would be quick to
note the subtle presence of those qualities in almost every aspect of
the genre.</LD>
<LD>   Duke Ellington's sacred music represents an exception -- a group
of compositions inspired by and connected to specific spiritual
reference points. Others--John Coltrane comes immediately to mind --
delved into more ecstatic areas of expression, as have many of the
contemporary artists exploring the blending of jazz with various
world musics.</LD>
<LD>   The tragedies of Sept. 11, 2001, produced surprisingly low-key
reaction in the jazz world. A few CD arrivals this month relate,
however indirectly, to personal responses triggered by Sept. 11,
others simply expressive of the power of jazz to voice inner
feelings, aspirations and spirituality.</LD>
<TE>   Charles Lloyd</TE>
<TE>   "Lift Every Voice"</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2, ECM Records</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd always has danced to the beat of his own inner rhythms, even
in his early, high-visibility years of the '60s. More recently, the
saxophonist has produced compelling music on an amazingly consistent
basis. Content to remain outside mainstream trends, his offerings
have been the product of a highly personal, but intensely
significant, spiritual worldview.</TE>
<TE>   In "Lift Every Voice," the emphasis is upon inner-seeking,
meditative sounds framed in a jazz setting.</TE>
<TE>   The material includes originals, as well as an occasional gospel
song. And the mood, even in the few titles that include briskly
rhythmic passages, is calm and thoughtful.</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd's work on tenor saxophone and flute is extraordinary,
embellishing velvety high notes with his patented melodic
ornamentations -- sly curlicues of notes connecting passages and
ending phrases.</TE>
<TE>   Pianist Brad Mehldau and guitarist John Abercrombie are perfect
companions in an intimate, three-way musical conversation.</TE>
<TE>   This is music in which the messages are never literal. But his
response to Sept. 11 is expressed at a level beyond words, rising
from the inner reaches of improvisational creativity.</TE>
<TE>   Monty Alexander</TE>
<TE>   "My America"</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2, Telarc Records</TE>
<TE>   This an upfront, heart-on-his-sleeve effort by the Jamaican-born
pianist to articulate his loving musical vision of this nation. The
very directness of Alexander's approach, in which he neither indulges
in patriotic excess nor hesitates to tap into the popular psyche,
makes for a compelling musical experience.</TE>
<TE>   The songs run the gamut of Alexander's musical memories, from the
jaunty fun of "Don't Fence Me In" and the darkly swinging "Mack the
Knife" to the soulful sensuality of "Sexual Healing" and the rousing
spirit of "The Battle Hymn of the Republic." Along the way, Alexander
is aided by vocalists Freddy Cole, John Pizzarelli and Kevin
Mahogany.</TE>
<TE>   But what makes this CD special is the quality of personal drive
and energy that Alexander brings to his interpretations. Listening to
his soloing, one never doubts the authenticity of his feelings or the
sheer, passionate involvement with which he approaches the music.</TE>
<TE>   Charlie Haden</TE>
<TE>   "American Dream"</TE>
<TE>   ***, Verve Records</TE>
<TE>   In the promotional material for this release, the bass player
insists that "American Dream" "wasn't conceived because of ... Sept.
11th, but to express the way I feel about this country, which is
built upon the ability to have dreams and create."</TE>
<TE>   But the choice of material and the way it is presented suggest
(with the exception of "America the Beautiful" and the Haden-penned
track that gives the album its name) that the title may have simply
been tacked onto a recording otherwise lacking a theme. Unlike other
superbly conceived and executed recent Haden releases, "American
Dream" simply doesn't match the music to the presumed concept.</TE>
<TE>   It does, however, offer another installment in Haden's fascination
with orchestral sounds that could serve as scores for cinematic
mystery thrillers. Arrangements by Alan Broadbent, Jeremy Lubbock and
Vince Mendoza of songs such as "It Might Be You" and "Love Like Ours"
(by Alan and Marilyn Bergman and Dave Grusin), the standard "Young
and Foolish" and tunes by Haden, Keith Jarrett, Don Sebesky and
others provide lush (sometimes too much so) settings for impressive
solo excursions by tenor saxophonist Michael Brecker and pianist Brad
Mehldau.</TE>

<LD>It may be time to say goodbye to "hi." In TV's world, at least,
there's no mo' "hello." As anyone knows who watches much television
-- Emmy's three big winners in particular -- the greeting of choice
is now "hey."</LD>
<LD>   Joey walks into Monica and Chandler's apartment on "Friends,"
announces himself with "hey," and listens to the rebounding "heys." A
stranded-in-Indiana Josh Lyman calls Sam Seaborn in the White House's
"West Wing," and Sam picks up with a "hey." Ray Barone greets his
wife Debra seemingly each week on "Everybody Loves Raymond" with a
loving "hey." And it's not just the big Emmy winners. We're pretty
sure Grace has greeted Will with a shrill "hey" of her own.</LD>
<LD>   This of course follows on Hank Kingsley's trademark line on "The
Larry Sanders Show": "Hey now."</LD>
<TE>   So what the hey is going on? It's unclear whether TV's writers are
setting a trend or are echoing what they're hearing out in the world
-- admit it, everyone around you is saying "hey" instead of "hello."
Perhaps in this rushed world, "hello" has too many syllables, and
"hi" sounds too naive. Or it could be just that the generation of
grandparents who greeted the word with a scolding " 'Hey' is for
horses" has gone on to the great thesaurus in the sky.</TE>
<TE>   Who knows? Suffice it to say "hey" is having its day.</TE>

<HD>The trick for 'Tuck': Appeal to kids and parents</HD>
<DH>The filmmakers' goal was a family movie that keeps the
book's depth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With "My Dog Skip" and his new Disney film, "Tuck Everlasting," Jay
Russell has gained a reputation as a director who makes family films
with substance -- and even something of an edge. Both films deal with
such dark subjects as aging, death and loss of innocence. In fact,
like "Peter Pan" and "The Black Stallion," they are just as much for
adults as children.</LD>
<LD>   "Adults are members of the family too," says the 42-year-old
Russell. "I remember when I was growing up and went to the movies
with my family, my parents would enjoy them just like I would. I
think there is room for a film that doesn't patronize kids. I think
kids like to be challenged."</LD>
<LD>   The mixture of adult and children's sensibilities worked for the
low-budget "Skip," a modest hit in 2000 that took in $34.1 million at
the box office. "Tuck," which opened Friday to extremely positive
early reviews, is aimed at teenage girls, although Disney also hopes
to pull in young women and parents.</LD>
<TE>   Russell remembers sitting in the back of the theaters for previews
for "Skip" and "Tuck" and breaking out into a cold sweat. "I would
think, [children] are not going to sit through this; it is too quiet.
It is too deliberately paced. And then in both cases I was just
pleased to have it pleasantly confirmed that they will sit through
these movies. One of the greatest thrills after the first preview of
'Tuck' was following the kids into the lobby after the film and
seeing them debating the movie."</TE>
<TE>   Based on the award-winning novel by Natalie Babbitt, "Tuck
Everlasting" is a magical fable about a teenage girl, Winnie (Alexis
Bledel), who longs to escape the grip of her demanding mother (Amy
Irving) and father (Victor Garber). One day she gets lost in the
woods near her home and is found by Jesse Tuck (Jonathan Jackson), a
joyous young man who lives with his family (William Hurt, Sissy
Spacek and Scott Bairstow). But they all share a powerful secret --
they have drunk from a magical stream that has given them eternal
life. The enigmatic Man in the Yellow Suit (Ben Kingsley) knows of
their secret and wants access to the water.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal is for the film to work on multiple levels," says
Russell. "I think that's why the 'Toy Story' movies work so well,
because adults and children are getting both the same and different
things out of them."</TE>
<TE>   "It's an amazing thing," says the film's co-star, Jackson. "It
gives people, especially young people, a safe environment to talk
about this stuff. A lot of the other entertainment is extremely
graphic, or if it's the news it is incredibly intense. I think it
would be hard for young people to talk about [death]."</TE>
<TE>   Issues of life and death</TE>
<TE>   Producer Jane Startz notes that the book "is a very, very
philosophical story that deals with the essentials -- choosing
between life and death and what does it mean to lead a full life. A
person's life is a sum of all of their parts, and part of that is
being young and part of that is being not so young."</TE>
<TE>   Screenwriter Jeffrey Lieber, who wrote the first four drafts of
the script, says because the book was "stuck right there between a
kids' book and an adult book, I was always riding the line as to
which way to go. My instincts are always to pull it older, and at
times Jane had to pull me back and remind me the core audience is 13
to 19 years of age. As an adult you look at the themes and you
connect to them so strongly. Kids want to grow up, but adults see
their past behind them."</TE>
<TE>   Screenwriter James V. Hart, who did the final version of the
script (he shares credit with Lieber), hopes adults see the movie.
"That's the problem with a movie like this, where they are targeting
a specific audience," he says. "When I did 'Hook' [Steven Spielberg's
take on "Peter Pan"], adults didn't discover that movie until video."</TE>
<TE>   Hart sees a lot of "Peter Pan" in "Tuck." Though James Barrie
wrote "Peter Pan" as a children's fairy play, Hart says, "it rests on
extremely layered and complex psychological issues that come from
being an adult. I guarantee there's a point in the play where every
adult cries and the kids don't, and that's when Wendy grows up and
tells Peter she can't fly. That's exactly the promise that Jesse Tuck
is making to Winnie Foster -- he is offering her the chance to be
Wendy."</TE>

<HD>Faith reborn amid a wasteland</HD>
<DH>"The poverty of life without dreams is too horrible to
imagine: It is the kind of madness which is the worst." -- Sylvia
Plath</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth Turan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Don't get me wrong, I love show business. But there are days ... days
when I'm not so sure, days when doubts are rampant. There may be an
antidote to that despair, but before we get there let's start with
scenes from a marriage--a marriage between the dream factory and
those who pull the levers to make it produce.</LD>
<LD>   The head of a major studio called me from his car on Oscar
nomination morning a few years back. As usual, Hollywood's
bread-and-butter pictures, the moronic cash cows of the moment, were
not well represented. The executive chuckled derisively. "People work
on these films every day all year long, and they won't vote for
them," he said. "They have contempt for what they do."</LD>
<LD>   A friend recently talked to some of the most successful
screenwriters, the A-list personnel who get films made and are well
paid in the bargain. How often, each of them was asked, do you think
of leaving the business? The answer that came back was always the
same: every day.</LD>
<TE>   In an interview that took place while he was chairman and chief
executive officer of Columbia Pictures, David Puttnam spoke to me
with horror of a fellow producer who'd told him he wouldn't want to
show his own films to his wife and children. "Why on Earth would you
inflict something on civilization you didn't feel you wanted your
children to see? I mean, aren't we part of civilization?"</TE>
<TE>   Losing out to the bottom line</TE>
<TE>   No one in Hollywood is averse to profit, nor should they be. But
the best and smartest people, in and out of the studio system, were
likely as not attracted to work in movies not because of the money,
but because of what film can do to mold individual hearts and minds.</TE>
<TE>   But to be in the movie business today is to be part of what seems
to be a losing battle between film's potential and its actuality. It
is to make your way in a world where caring about anything besides
box office grosses or profit margins is to risk being labeled naive,
foolish or worse. We still love the movies, we are still all but
desperate to be entertained, but people in the business are often
horrified at what the pressures of the marketplace have forced
pictures and their creators to become.</TE>
<TE>   Given the dreams so many came in with, who can avoid asking, "Is
this all there is?" It's as if we have control of the most powerful
energy source the world has ever known, and all we do with it is warm
up after-school snacks.</TE>
<TE>   Which is part of the reason why New York-based FilmAid
(www.filmaidinter national.org) struck such a powerful chord, why
hearing about it moved me so much.</TE>
<TE>   An organization for an increasingly savage world, FilmAid has a
motivating idea that, like many of the best ones, is beautifully
simple: to show movies to refugees and displaced persons, to go to
the pitiless camps where residents spend years of their lives, to
bring cinema to those who desperately need its ability to lift
spirits, inspire hearts and enlighten minds.</TE>
<TE>   Showing movies to people in desperate circumstances may sound
silly or frivolous, the last thing that's needed, but those on the
ground are the organization's most enthusiastic supporters. "The
worst thing is that the refugees have nothing to occupy their mind,"
says Sarah Sheldon of the humanitarian group Doctors of the World.
"Movies can provide a way to escape a narrow, painful daily
existence."</TE>
<TE>   So it's not surprising that FilmAid got the almost immediate
backing of UNICEF and the International Rescue Committee. It's also
not surprising, given the frustrating ways the world sometimes
functions, that FilmAid, despite all the good it's done since it was
founded in 1999, is, in the words of founder Caroline Baron,
"desperately in need of money."</TE>
<TE>   Baron, most recently producer of Mira Nair's "Monsoon Wedding," is
not some naive humanitarian but a savvy industry veteran. Her
numerous credits include everything from Meg Ryan's "Addicted to
Love" to Norman Mailer's "Tough Guys Don't Dance" to Troma
Entertainment's schlocky "The Toxic Avenger." FilmAid was born of
Baron's need to help when fighting in Kosovo forced a mass exodus to
Macedonia. "I heard a report on NPR that said the biggest refugee
problems were psychological trauma and idleness. I thought, 'Maybe I
can organize screenings.' "</TE>
<TE>   Six weeks to the day from getting that idea, having "called
everyone I could possibly think of" and having raised $60,000, Baron
was flying into Macedonia with a projector and a screen. "Within a
day," she says, "we were showing films."</TE>
<TE>   In the nearly three years since, FilmAid has shown films not only
in Macedonia, but also in Kenya and Tanzania, home to massive refugee
camps on a continent where people regularly spend a decade or more
living in them and where audiences as large as 13,000 (that's not a
misprint) gather on summer nights. And where films (everything from
wildlife footage to Charlie Chaplin) are so popular that refugees
have told Baron they would gladly give up a meal to watch a movie.</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan, where Baron and FilmAid recently went to see if
they'd be welcome (the answer is very much yes), a screening of "The
Wizard of Oz" was set up for a group of street kids who, because of
Taliban strictures, were unfamiliar with even the concept of singing.
"The color, the music, Toto, they were completely overwhelmed," Baron
reports. "Watching them watch Dorothy singing 'Over the Rainbow' was
heartbreaking."</TE>
<TE>   The screenings in Africa also revealed what Baron calls "the
healing aspect of film. The Kakuma camp has a center for malnourished
babies, but the mothers were so depressed and exhausted the babies
were not gaining any weight. But they started showing cartoons in the
feeding center, the mothers started laughing, and the babies gained
weight. That's what the power of film does."</TE>
<TE>   Seeing movies, but also violence</TE>
<TE>   Because film can do so much, Baron wishes "the studios would stand
up, look and understand the value of what we as filmmakers do. In
almost every camp, there are local refugee entrepreneurs showing the
most violent American films. When kids see that you're an American,
they run up and make machine-gun gestures; that's what they think
America is. That's scary, and, with so much beauty that could be
offered, that's also sad and a shame."</TE>
<TE>   FilmAid needs equipment of all types, but mostly what is needed is
money. The organization has been running on a nearly depleted seed
grant from a branch of the State Department, but Baron says, "What I
had hoped for from the very beginning is that we would not take money
from organizations, that we, the entertainment industry, would give
back this way."</TE>
<TE>   And the money involved is, by Hollywood standards, so small, from
the $3,000 to pay one year's salary for a refugee video operator to
the $250,000 that underwrites a complete evening screening program
for one year. "If the studios each gave us that much, we could
sustain our overhead, be in Afghanistan and continue our work in
Africa," Baron says. "That's not even the cost of a premiere."</TE>
<TE>   To hear what FilmAid has already accomplished, to watch videos of
exhausted and debilitated refugee audiences of all ages soaking up
films as if they were a necessity of life, is to regain a sorely
tried faith. . Is it asking too much for the powers that be to get
past short-term "What's in it for me?" thinking and understand the
value to everyone's future in supporting FilmAid? For the sake of the
world we all share, I hope not.</TE>

<LD>When David Henry Hwang's version of "Flower Drum Song" opens in New
York this week, it will be the first musical about Asian Americans on
Broadway since, well, "Flower Drum Song."</LD>
<LD>   No one doubts that Asian Americans have had trouble reaching the
Great White Way. Hwang is the only writer to have made it, with three
plays and two musicals including his "re-imagination" of Rodgers &amp;
Hammerstein's 1958 tale about San Francisco's Chinatown. A handful of
artists have carved out distinguished careers, and chorus lines are
becoming more integrated. Too often, however, roles have been limited
to the niche nicknamed "geishas, gangsters and gooks" or to the dozen
or so shows set in Asia, the foreign having more audience appeal than
the domestic.</LD>
<LD>   "Broadway is a wasteland for us," New York playwright Alvin Eng
says. The fact that this doesn't bother more of his colleagues says a
lot about what has and hasn't changed in the past half-century of
Asian American theater.</LD>
<TE>   For one thing, Broadway no longer has the cultural clout it did
when the original "Flower Drum Song" debuted. Nor is it considered to
be the creative center of the country's theatrical universe. High
costs have pushed producers to embrace commercially safe fare.
Off-Broadway and the nonprofit regional stages -- the incubators of
the most important and challenging works -- are widely seen as a
truer testing ground of artistic mettle and the ability of Asian
American plays to cross into the mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   So, if not to Broadway, where is Asian American theater heading?
Since the 1960s, nearly 100 companies have sprouted, from the Sierra
to New England, fueled by increasing and increasingly diverse
immigration. The old guard of Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Filipino
writers has been joined by newer generations and by Vietnamese,
Indians and other South Asians.</TE>
<TE>   "You can see these waves of change," says Tim Dang, producing
artistic director of Los Angeles' East West Players, at 37 the
granddaddy of Asian American theaters. He counts Frank Chin and
Wakako Yamauchi among a first generation of playwrights who
confronted identity conflicts. Then came Hwang and Philip Kan
Gotanda, both of whom straddle old and new worlds and thus are
popular with national companies.</TE>
<TE>   Dang's "1.5 generation," a term usually used for the Americanized
children of Asian immigrants, includes Chay Yew, Prince Gomolvilas
and Diana Son (who has noted her predecessors felt a responsibility
to say, "We are here," while her peers say, "We are weird").</TE>
<TE>   Younger groups like the local Lodestone ensemble follow their own
rules, while the writers are re-asking the question "Who am I?" as
immigrants again outnumber American-born Asians.</TE>
<TE>   Asian American artists often do not set their sights on Broadway
because "they are too busy looking for a way to tell their own
stories," Dang says. "They are still more interested in seeking
validation from their own communities, and in some cases, their
families."</TE>
<TE>   This mosaic of voices has inspired the blossoming of Asian
American theater, as well as a new surge in fiction, another art form
in which it's easier for personal vision to outweigh popular appeal.
However, the narrow focus of many Asian American plays can make them
feel inaccessible to broader audiences, mainstream theaters say. By
their nature, many Asian American works fit better -- physically or
politically -- in smaller spaces.</TE>
<TE>   "Broadway is a shining beacon," says Yew, who runs the Mark Taper
Forum's Asian Theatre Workshop. "But it's mythic. I'd rather make
sure a play is in the right home."</TE>
<TE>   Asian Americans have begun building bridges to other theater
worlds. Adaptations are in vogue. After reinterpreting "The House of
Bernarda Alba," Yew is planning to take on another Federico Garcia
Lorca play for San Francisco's American Conservatory Theater. (ACT
also has commissioned an original Asian American musical, "Chinese
Hell.") Gotanda's "The Wind Cries Mary," his version of "Hedda
Gabler," is opening this month at the San Jose Repertory Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   The New York-based National Asian American Theatre Company inverts
the usual formula, performing Western plays with Asian-ancestry
casts. This gives actors the chance to perform roles usually denied
them, says co-founder Mia Katigbak. The group also wants to get
producers to "throw out preconceived notions about what this
[Asian-looking] face might be."</TE>
<TE>   Some fear the boom in Asian-specific theaters reduces the chances
of showing non-Asian producers and audiences new ideas and new faces.
Actors are more inclined to believe employment and experience (i.e.,
working on mainstream stages) trump empowerment.</TE>
<TE>   "Both kinds of theater need to go hand in hand," says Christine
Toy Johnson, who has won non-Asian roles in Broadway productions,
including the recent revival of "The Music Man." "We won't change
people's views of us as artists unless we get wider exposure."</TE>
<TE>   'Opportunities are paltry'</TE>
<TE>   Ask a dozen mainstream producers about Asian American theater, and
nearly all say the same two things: "I don't know much" and "What I
do know is David Henry Hwang." After a pause, they add that the
outlook for cracking the general theater scene is bleak.</TE>
<TE>   "Opportunities are paltry," says Margo Lion, whose credits include
the current hit "Hairspray." "I'm interested in creating a more
representative theater, but many other producers don't see it that
way." Instead, they concentrate on bottom lines and say they haven't
found enough good plays or performers to cast in them, while
acknowledging that writers and actors cannot hone their craft without
chances to work.</TE>
<TE>   Not many people believe there is a viable audience base, outside
of the West Coast, either of Asian Americans or others who will
attend Asian American plays. (The League of American Theatres and
Producers estimates that 4% of Broadway audiences are Asian
Americans.)</TE>
<TE>   Artistic directors and producers face hard questions when it comes
to bringing Asian American shows to larger venues, says Gordon
Davidson of the Ahmanson Theatre and Mark Taper Forum. "There only
are so many spots and while there's a lot more work being done and a
lot more actors, there's only so much out there ... and you want to
resist the idea of doing one thing from each ethnic group just to do
it."</TE>
<TE>   Having grown up in the era of diversity subsidies, the middle
generation of playwrights jokes about who gets what they call "the
chink slot" at various major houses each year, claiming quality can
get lost in the politics of correctness.</TE>
<TE>   "I say thank God for 'the chink slot,' " says Yew, ever the
contrarian. "I wish we could get more organic, but I'm just glad
anybody wants to do the work."</TE>
<TE>   He says Asian Americans "tend to assimilate well. We don't support
our own theater. Someone will say, 'I want to see 'Mamma Mia!' but if
you mention a playwright like Alice Tuan they'll say, 'Uh, will that
be something serious?' and turn away."</TE>
<TE>   While the Public Theater in New York and a few other off-Broadway
institutions have championed Asian Americans, regional companies are
seen as the biggest hopes for change, especially with the emergence
of artistic directors who view Asian Americans as a natural part of
their theater's life.</TE>
<TE>   The Taper and its Asian workshop, for instance, have presented
more than three dozen readings, workshops and plays, including the
world premiere of the new "Flower Drum Song," and offer content to
small companies that lack the resources to develop their own
material.</TE>
<TE>   Asian American stage artists also name Hwang as their most
powerful influence and cite his ability to excel artistically and
commercially -- most with admiration, a few with arched eyebrows.</TE>
<TE>   A dream deferred</TE>
<TE>   The man who wrote the novel "Flower Drum Song" really had wanted
to write a play. C.Y. Lee fled war-torn China in the 1940s and
enrolled at Yale drama school, but an agent told him: "Forget that
Chinese stuff. It won't sell in the American theater." Richard
Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II turned Lee's 1957 book into a
Broadway musical, which was the first mainstream theater attempt to
portray Asian Americans as other than exotica.</TE>
<TE>   "Flower Drum Song" ran for nearly two years, became a splashy
Universal movie and then fell into oblivion, a victim of protests
about cultural caricatures and worries about casting.</TE>
<TE>   Hwang credits a risk-taking producer with helping him end Asian
America's Broadway drought in 1988 with "M. Butterfly," his story
about a Frenchman's affair with a Chinese transvestite. The play was
a surprise hit, won a Tony, and "I suddenly became a 'proven'
Broadway writer," Hwang says.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, it took a decade for his Chinese family history
"Golden Child" to open in New York. (His other play closed in
previews.) Then it took six years to convince backers that his new
"Flower Drum Song" could sell tickets.</TE>
<TE>   Another milestone came in the early '90s with "Miss Saigon," but
not because of the show, which was criticized for its stereotypes.
Its star, Lea Salonga, won a Tony, and the firestorm sparked by the
casting of a white actor as a Eurasian pimp was a rare rebellion led
by a historically quiet community.</TE>
<TE>   Hwang's sharper "Flower Drum Song" is Asian America's best chance
for Broadway success, an important prospect because, as Eng says,
"we're finally getting to be seen as Americans, but we're not part of
Americana." Whatever its flaws, Broadway is Americana.</TE>
<TE>   "If you keep being the barbarian at the gate, you have to keep
waiting for someone to open the gate for you," Yew says. "That's why
I love Asian American theater. You don't have to keep pounding on the
doors. You just keep creating new work."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Dire 'Drum Song'</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since Marco Polo, the Orient has exerted a steady and
growing influence on the Western imagination. I need only mention the
names of Stevenson, Gauguin, Lafcadio Hern, Sax Rohmer and W.C Fields
to indicate how much our civilization owes to the ancient cultures of
the East. Our debt was increased last week by the arrival at the St.
James Theatre of 'Flower Drum Song,' the new musical by Rodgers and
Hammerstein II. In this case, I fear, what we owe is not gratitude
but an apology.... Perhaps as a riposte to Joshua Logan's 'The World
of Suzie Wong,' Rodgers and Hammerstein have given us what, if I had
any self control at all, I would refrain from describing as a world
of woozy song."</TE>
<TE>   -- Kenneth Tynan, the New Yorker, Dec. 13, 1958</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<LD>I was at my Aunt Raquel's peacefully reading "Dexter's Dizzy Day"
when she came up to me, leading my little cousin by the hand. "Lexie,
could you be a sweetheart and keep Marcos amused for a while?" She
led me into his bedroom. "Your mother and I would like to visit a
little. His clothes are on the bed."</LD>
<LD>   The chubby little toddler wore a diaper and socks. His huge brown
eyes looked out at me from under curly black hair. He frowned like a
fierce angel.</LD>
<LD>   Marcos intimidated me, but I said, "I guess so," as she left the
room.</LD>
<TE>   I picked up his striped shirt from the bed. "Here, Marcos, let's
put on your shirt."</TE>
<TE>   "I can!" he said and grabbed the shirt.</TE>
<TE>   That's good. He wants to learn things. I watched him slowly and
awkwardly pull the shirt over his head. It was hard to keep from
helping.</TE>
<TE>   He got it on backward and smiled proudly.</TE>
<TE>   "I can!" he said when I held out his pants. He stuck one leg in,
and I quickly turned them so they went on right.</TE>
<TE>   "I can!" he repeated about his shoes, then put them on the wrong
feet. I tried to change them, but he reminded me "I can," and ran
away.</TE>
<TE>   Now we went to the kitchen for a snack. "How about some breakfast,
Marcos?"</TE>
<TE>   "I can!" he said, so I held the chair as he climbed up.</TE>
<TE>   "I can!" he said when I tried to help him with the spoon and
cereal.</TE>
<TE>   "I can!" he said and began drinking milk from his sipper cup while
I wiped up the cereal he had spilled.</TE>
<TE>   Now he was through with breakfast and more or less dressed. What
to do next?</TE>
<TE>   Then I saw a picture book.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me read you a story, Marcos."</TE>
<TE>   He looked at me doubtfully. I waited for "I can," but after
thinking awhile, Marcos said, "OK," and climbed onto my lap.</TE>
<TE>   I smiled. "Someday you will be able to read, Marcos!"</TE>
<TE>   "Someday I can!"</TE>
<TE>   Marcos smiled happily as I opened "The Little Blue Pickup."</TE>
<TE>   Kay Haugaard says it may be hard to watch children as they
struggle to do things by themselves, but if you always do it for
them, they will never learn. Marcos knows this already. He also knows
there are some things he cannot do--yet! This story will be on The
Times' Web site at www.latimes.com/kids.</TE>

<LD>A Pasadena low-income housing complex has begun much-needed
rehabilitation after receiving funding from two finance companies
eager to make the 25-year-old development more livable.</LD>
<LD>   Related Capital Co. and Charter Municipal Mortgage Acceptance Co.
recently provided $10 million in equity for tax credits and financing
through bond investments to Northwest Pasadena Development Corp. to
upgrade the 133-unit Community Arms.</LD>
<LD>   Built in 1977, the complex's 18 two- and three-story buildings --
occupied entirely by low-income, federally subsidized renters -- will
undergo renovation, including central air-conditioning, garbage
disposals and new appliances for each unit. Four playgrounds, a
basketball court, covered carports and security will be added, plus a
5,000-square-foot learning center.</LD>

<LD>This Tuscan villa-style home in Pasadena has been a star of movies,
TV, print ads and events, including a Pasadena Heritage Tour.</LD>
<LD>   Designed by Frank M. Tyler and built in 1911, the house was
originally owned by a director of Citizens Savings Bank in Pasadena.
It's now owned by an interior designer and his wife, who plan to
downsize because their children are grown.</LD>
<LD>   "Mr. Wrong," starring Ellen DeGeneres, "The Tie That Binds,"
starring Keith Carradine and Daryl Hannah, and "Murder She Wrote"
with Angela Lansbury are just a few of the movies and TV shows filmed
in the house, which has had more than a dozen celebrity visitors over
the years. Among them: Jodie Foster, Michael J. Fox, James Earl
Jones, James Coburn, Kevin Costner and Bruce Springsteen, who was
photographed in the home by Annie Leibovitz for an album cover.</LD>
<TE>   About this house: The grand staircase, dark hardwood floors,
ceiling and crown moldings in the dining room, crown moldings in the
entry and fireplace in the conservatory are believed to be original,
but there are also such new features as the fireplace mantel and
hearth in the living room.</TE>
<TE>   The ballroom was added in 1988. The chandelier was cut in half to
move it into the room. The ceilings are 28 feet high. Pocket doors
separate the living room and the ballroom. The doors disappear into
the walls to open up the room for entertaining. The house can
accommodate 350 guests.</TE>
<TE>   Asking price: $4.8 million</TE>
<TE>   Size: The home has five bedrooms and 5 1/2 bathrooms in 8,200-plus

<HD>'Mindhunter' turns house hunter on the Westside</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ruth Ryon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Christian Slater, who co-stars with Val Kilmer in the upcoming movie
"Mindhunters," has purchased a Westside home behind gates for just
under $4.5 million.</LD>
<LD>   It's Slater's first home purchase in the L.A. area since he sold
his Hollywood Hills home to actor Tim Allen for $2.2 million in
January 2000. At the time, Slater was spending most of his time in
his native New York.</LD>
<LD>   The home he just bought was newly built by high-end residential
developer David Murdock Jr., whose father is Dole Food Co. chairman
and chief executive.</LD>
<TE>   The house has four bedrooms and 6.5 bathrooms in about 6,500
square feet. The master suite has his-and-hers marble baths, a
fireplace, a vaulted ceiling and a balcony. The home also has a
family room, library and studio. The grounds have a pool, spa,
waterfall and gardens.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Slater co-starred with Nicolas Cage in the movie
"Windtalkers," and he co-starred with Tim Allen, Richard Dreyfuss and
Portia de Rossi in the film "Who Is Cletis Tout?" He also co-starred
in "The Contender" (2000) and "Broken Arrow" (1996). He was cast in
the Bob Dylan film "Masked and Anonymous," which is due out next
year. "Mindhunters" is also expected to be released in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Slater, 33, started acting at age 11 and began getting starring
roles at 20. He purchased his first house when he was 19.</TE>
<TE>   During the last few years Slater married TV executive Ryan Haddon,
and they became parents of two children.</TE>
<TE>   Taking a retreat from the Venice beachfront</TE>
<TE>   Nicolas Cage, who bought a beachfront Venice home in April for
about $2.7 million, has put his getaway up for lease at $35,000 a
month, including furnishings.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Marie Presley, whom the Oscar-winning actor married in
August, wasn't keen on the view of bathing beauties in front of the
house, area sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The newlyweds have a number of other homes in the L.A. area.</TE>
<TE>   The Venice house, which has an ocean view from every room, has a
rooftop deck and mirrored windows, so occupants can look out but
nobody can see in.</TE>
<TE>   The three-story house has four bedrooms and 4.5 bathrooms in about
4,400 square feet. It also has a den, dining area, breakfast bar,
media room and two fireplaces.</TE>
<TE>   Cage, 38, co-stars with Meryl Streep in the movie "Adaptation,"
due out Dec. 6. He made his feature directorial debut with the movie
"Sonny," which premiered at the Deauville Festival of American Film
in September.</TE>
<TE>   Leaving Beverly Hills -- together</TE>
<TE>   Renee Taylor and Joe Bologna, the acting-writing duo for theater
and TV, have put their Beverly Hills home on the market to lease at
$15,000 a month, fully furnished, long or short term. The couple is
moving to the beach for a while.</TE>
<TE>   Their Country English-style home has three bedrooms in 4,300
square feet.</TE>
<TE>   It was built in 1926 and has been completely updated. It features
a living room with a fireplace and a wet bar; a family room with a
fireplace and an office; a kitchen with an eat-in area; a master
suite with cathedral beams and a fireplace; and an outside barbecue
area with gardens, a pool and a guest house.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor and Bologna have been married since 1965. They have renewed
their wedding vows at frequent intervals and with great publicity in
Buddhist, Hindu and various other ceremonies. In 2001, they co-wrote
the Broadway play "If You Ever Leave Me, I'm Going With You." The
same year she wrote and starred in the one-person show "An Evening
With Golda Meir," which Bologna directed on Long Island. The couple
has new productions of both plays on their schedule.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, he played Adam Sandler's father in the movie "Big Daddy."
In 1982, he won acclaim for his role as a Sid Caesar-like TV comic in
"My Favorite Year." She had a recurring role of Sylvia Fine on "The
Nanny" from 1994-1999.</TE>
<TE>   Elaine Young and Barbara Eisner have the listing at DBL, Beverly
Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Off to their place in the desert sun</TE>
<TE>   Steve Inwood, who played the evil character Moreno on the ABC
daytime series "General Hospital," and his investment manager wife,
Susan, have listed their Craftsman-like home in Westwood for sale at
just under $1.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The couple are selling because the home is too large for them now
that they are spending more time at their desert retreat, which they
bought two years ago. He wrote a screenplay called "Dark Eyes," which
he plans to film in Palm Springs next year. The couple also plan to
buy a smaller home in Los Angeles. Susan Inwood is a senior vice
president at Salomon Smith Barney Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The actor, who has appeared on many TV series over the years and
recently attended Paramount's 20th reunion party as a cast member of
the movie "Staying Alive," personally restored the Westwood home,
built in 1941, after buying it in 1995. He installed such Craftsman
features as milled windows and walkways modeled after those at the
Gamble House in Pasadena. The Gamble House is a prime example of the
American Arts and Crafts style.</TE>
<TE>   The four-bedroom, 3,300-square-foot house owned by the Inwoods has
four bathrooms, a breakfast room, a formal dining room and a master
suite with marble bath, sitting area and gym. The home also has three
fireplaces, a brick patio, a pool and a spa.</TE>
<TE>   The house is listed with Eliane and Armand Capdeville at Coldwell
Banker, Westwood, and Stacey Weaver at DBL, Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Manhattan Beach is this King's goal</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Kings enforcer Ken Belander and his wife, Sandra, have
purchased a three-bedroom home in Manhattan Beach for $660,000.</TE>
<TE>   The house, behind gates, also has 2.5 bathrooms in 1,900 square
feet.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings player, 27, was signed as a free agent a year ago last
summer after the Boston Bruins failed to make him a qualifying offer.
He grew up in Ontario.</TE>
<TE>   Phyllis Cohen-Edwards of Shorewood Realtors, Manhattan Beach, had
the listing.</TE>

<HD>San Pedro: Blue-collar soul with ocean views</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mary Forgione</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Pedro, on the eastern slope of the Palos Verdes Peninsula, is
known for its steep inland hills, high ocean bluffs and the Port of
Los Angeles. Its own city until 1910, when it became part of Los
Angeles, San Pedro recently tried to put a secession measure on the
November ballot but remains under the control of the Los Angeles City
Council. The low-profile community of 80,741, more than 20 miles from
City Hall, is home to Mayor James K. Hahn.</LD>
<LD>   Drawing card</LD>
<LD>   You get more bang for your ocean-side buck here than in tonier
Rancho Palos Verdes, Redondo Beach or other South Bay cities.</LD>
<TE>   Wow factor</TE>
<TE>   It's all about the views, particularly those of Catalina Island.
San Pedro has a rugged shoreline with crumbling bluffs and a vintage
lighthouse more reminiscent of Northern California than the groomed,
flat beaches of Redondo Beach or Torrance. The inland hillside homes
capitalize on views of Los Angeles Harbor and Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Hot spots</TE>
<TE>   The two most desirable neighborhoods, South Shores ($600,000 to
$800,000) and Palisades (high $400,000s to $750,000), have Catalina
views. Vista del Oro (low $300,000s to $800,000) is the inland heart
of San Pedro. Taper Street and its townhouse complex called the
Gardens (high $200,000s to low $500,000s) is an '80s-era neighborhood
popular with young families.</TE>
<TE>   Bargain hunters may want to search the bluff-side Point Fermin
area (high $200,000s to $500,000) or the inland Holy Trinity area
(high $200,000s to $400,000). Prices drop the closer you get to the
area's dowdy strip-mall gateway of Gaffey Street and the older
section of town on and below Pacific Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Insider's view</TE>
<TE>   The community has an unpretentious appeal likely attributed to its
blue-collar soul. Its mix of dockworkers, military personnel (Ft.
MacArthur is still an active base) and old and new immigrants give
the area an eclectic feel. The Old Town area (6th and 7th streets) is
undergoing a renaissance with new restaurants, the refurbished Warner
Grand Theatre, galleries and coffeehouses. Ports o' Call Village
remains a tourist draw.</TE>
<TE>   Stock report</TE>
<TE>   Single-family homes dominate, with condominiums and townhouses
making up about 15% to 20% of the housing stock. Unlike other parts
of suburban L.A., San Pedro didn't grow up around '50s- and '60s-era
tract houses. Homes built from the 1920s through the 1960s on
tree-lined streets give the area a distinctive charm. It's not
uncommon to see an older Mediterranean between a Cape Cod and an
English Tudor.</TE>
<TE>   Report card</TE>
<TE>   Public schools in San Pedro are part of the Los Angeles Unified
School District. Elementary schools are the strong suit here; test
scores fall off at the middle schools and at the sole high school,
San Pedro High.</TE>
<TE>   Weather report</TE>
<TE>   Within San Pedro, inland areas stay sunny and warm; ocean-side
neighborhoods are cooler and can be fogged in during mornings.</TE>
<TE>   Good news, bad news</TE>
<TE>   San Pedro has an out-of-the-way feel. However, the congested 110
Freeway is the only main artery off the peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   Also, although the seaside location means cooler temperatures and
great views, it doesn't translate to cleaner air.</TE>
<TE>   A study by the South Coast Air Quality Management District found
that the area nearest the port has the dirtiest air in Los Angeles
County.</TE>

<HD>Study confirms rising Latino market</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mary Umberger</AU>
<BD>Chicago Tribune</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CHICAGO -- The real estate industry just got a couple more reminders
to sign up for Spanish lessons. But it's not as if the message hasn't
been left before.</LD>
<LD>   For years, demographic soothsayers have urged the housing industry
to take seriously the riches that could be mined by marketing its
products and services to immigrants, particularly Latinos.</LD>
<LD>   The latest reminder comes from Pepperdine University, which has
released a study of Latino housing demand. The study drives home the
huge strides in Latino homeownership and the potential for more.</LD>
<TE>   More than two-thirds of U.S.-born Latinos in California own their
homes. About 40% of Latino homeowners bought their homes in the last
five years. In 2001, more than 1 in 5 homes sold in California were
to Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   More than 65% of potential home buyers who are Latino say they
would prefer to conduct the home-buying process in Spanish. Almost
80% say they would prefer to work with Spanish-speaking agents, and
more than 60% want to deal with Spanish-speaking mortgage lenders.</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing a market and making the most of it are two different
things. Just 5% of members in the National Assn. of Realtors are
Latino, according to the trade group's most recent numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Individually, many real estate companies say they're trying to
recruit more Spanish-speaking agents. The Realtors group has
developed a program with the federal government that teaches business
etiquette as practiced by various cultures and business strategies
intended to attract immigrant and minority clients.</TE>
<TE>   Small steps? Well, sure. But this is an industry that almost seems
to relish its fragmented nature: a zillion entrepreneurial players
dominate home sales, home building, lending, rentals and the many
related fields. This fragmentation could be an asset, according to
another new report.</TE>
<TE>   "A Nation of Niches," a new forecast from Lend-Lease Real Estate
Investment in Atlanta, reminds clients that American consumers are
growing more segmented every day.</TE>
<TE>   "Product customization is key to success in a society with dozens
of cable TV channels and FM radio stations catering to just about
every age group, native language and hobby," according to the
authors, M. Leanne Lachman and Deborah L. Brett.</TE>
<TE>   America's demographic profile is expanding but fragmented. Market
demand will be specialized and best served by the Department of
Housing and Urban Development by niche players, the authors claim.</TE>

<LD>I am a die-hard apartment dweller, one of those mythological beasts
thought not to exist in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   A Los Angeles native, I was raised in a single-family home in the
San Fernando Valley. The five of us shared three bedrooms and one

<LD>   My father made all the repairs on the property while working eight
to 10 hours a day, seven days a week, as a machinist.</LD>
<TE>   It was my parents' dream, the American dream, to own their own
home. But they exhausted themselves trying to make the necessary
repairs over the years and keep the place up.</TE>
<TE>   This is not my dream.</TE>
<TE>   I left home more than 15 years ago for a series of apartments,
each one bigger and more luxurious than the home where I grew up.</TE>
<TE>   My current apartment home has two bedrooms and two bathrooms. I
have a view of a boulevard, central air-conditioning and a balcony
suitable for barbecuing and watching the sun set.</TE>
<TE>   It is also safe and secure, with a double-deadbolt heavy front
door, underground parking, remote-controlled access and a security
door in front.</TE>
<TE>   I call the building manager when the garbage disposal goes out or
the compressor on the A/C blows up. I do not pay a dime.</TE>
<TE>   All the appliances are electric, but I do not have to pay for gas
or water. I do not mow the lawn, worry about roof leaks or dread the
bill to replace old pipes.</TE>
<TE>   The most I have done over the years is paint the interior walls,
and then the manager bought the paint, brushes, rollers and
dropcloths. I supplied the manpower because I wanted to have the
experience of painting my own home. It was my choice.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, I would love to have a dog, a fireplace and a washer and
dryer in the apartment, but I do have a clean communal laundry room
on the first floor, and pets and a fireplace are not necessities. I
can have a cat if I desire, and candles are just as romantic as a
fireplace.</TE>
<TE>   Should I ever want these things, I can easily find another
apartment with the amenities I need. I give 30 days' notice and move
out. I do not have to worry about selling my old residence before
moving to a new address.</TE>
<TE>   Friends and family do not understand my desire to live forever in
an apartment. "You're throwing away money on rent when you could be
building equity," one told me. "You don't have to live with someone
on the other side of the wall," another offered. "It's not yours," a
relative sniffed.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, it is mine. This is my home, and I have never felt, even for
an instant, that it was not. I live here, I am comfortable here, more
so than I have been anywhere else. And that is all that matters to
me.</TE>
<TE>   Assurances that this is my home do not assuage the skepticism of
my family and friends. They cannot understand how I could be happy in
an apartment. Some of them have lived in apartments before, but only
to save money to buy a house. My parents finally admitted my
apartment was bigger than their house, but I have seen people go more
willingly to the dentist's chair.</TE>
<TE>   I have had some precious memories in my apartment, events small
and large that I don't think I would have experienced the same way in
a house. I remember my first Christmas tree, shining like a beacon in
the second-floor window of my first apartment. The huge party we
threw for my niece's christening. Fifty people attended, enjoying
themselves in every room of the apartment, and outdoors as well,
sitting around the pool in the cool, bright California winter
sunshine.</TE>
<TE>   I have had Christmas dinners, Thanksgiving parties, graduation
banquets and intimate dinner parties. I have played my television
loud, raised the volume on the stereo and gone for a swim in the pool
at 2 a.m. on a hot August night.</TE>
<TE>   After the earthquake in 1994, we were stranded without electricity
for a few days. The interior hallways were so dark that the neighbors
agreed to leave their doors open, allowing light to seep into the
halls. Our building became a large house, with tenants helping each
other clean up, keeping each other company through the aftershocks.</TE>
<TE>   When the power returned, we had a potluck dinner party at the
pool. Every tenant attended, even the long-absent building owner.</TE>
<TE>   When someone gets stuck in the elevator, we all respond, shouting
words of encouragement and summoning the fire department. No one
leaves until the person is free.</TE>
<TE>   And when an ambulance comes to assist one of the elderly tenants,
we stop in to offer rides to the hospital or to tape notes of
encouragement to the door. For me, apartment living has been communal
living at its best.</TE>
<TE>   I no longer care if people understand the need for some of us to
live our lives in apartments without thought to pursuing the dream of
homeownership.</TE>
<TE>   My apartment is in a great neighborhood where I could never afford
a house. It is within walking distance of a supermarket, an upscale
mall, a major city park, big beautiful trees and a variety of
restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   I love my apartment; I love my neighborhood. I offer no apologies
for where I live.</TE>
<TE>   This is my home, my apartment home. And I would not want to be
anywhere else.</TE>

<HD>Act with care to spare your security deposit</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>H. May Spitz</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>People worry about the refunding of their security deposit. Will the
deposit be returned in full or will there be controversy over its
disbursement? Will it arrive at all and for what amount?</LD>
<LD>   Topping the list of deposit deductions is damage. The law allows
for tenant "wear and tear" but does not define it. Most agree wear
and tear is usually gradual and comes from normal residential use.
Damage is inflicted.</LD>
<LD>   For example, a worn-out walk pattern on the kitchen floor may be
normal wear and tear. Burn marks, rips or furniture scrapes are
damage. A door removed and carefully stored may be acceptable. A door
missing is not.</LD>
<TE>   Missing fixtures are usually considered damage. One resident
removed all the new screens to brighten up the unit. At move-out the
screens were nowhere to be found, and the cost of replacement was
deducted from her deposit. Older screens could be pro-rated.</TE>
<TE>   Original blinds, carpets, light fixtures -- even if replaced with
something nicer and then only with permission -- should be safely
stored if removed.</TE>
<TE>   One tenant wanted to redecorate and replaced the cabinet handles
to match his modern decor. The problem? When asked to put back the
original handles at move-out, the tenant sheepishly admitted they
were tossed out. Damage deduction? Yes. The old handles were gone,
the new handles were installed with the wrong-sized screws and soon
fell out.</TE>
<TE>   Worn-out keys? Not usually a tenant's fault. Broken key inside the
lock because you twisted the device too hard? Your fault.</TE>
<TE>   Carpet worn out after several years is normal. Permanent stains,
such as juice or burns, are not.</TE>
<TE>   One tenant asked for all new drapes at move-in. While not legally
required, window coverings are a nice touch. A year later, the tenant
and her pet cat moved out. The drapes now sported small pinholes.</TE>
<TE>   Wear and tear, or damage? Damage, since the 1-year-old drapes
weren't worn out, they were clawed. Sun damage would have been
acceptable; pet damage was not.</TE>
<TE>   Most leases prohibit changes or alterations, such as painting,
unless approved in writing. Some tenants paint anyway, figuring that
it's OK if they put the color back to the original when they move
out.</TE>
<TE>   But before you pick up a paint brush, pick up a pen and get
written, specific approval from the landlord. Getting permission from
the final party who writes deposit checks is the best insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Permission isn't always enough. Beautiful designer colors graced a
once dull kitchen and bath, thanks to the tenant's great taste. The
problem? Besides requiring several coats to cover, the new paint,
though lovely, was water-based. Water-based paint is made to cover
water-based surfaces. Kitchens, bathrooms and woodwork are usually
painted with oil-based paint to repel moisture.</TE>
<TE>   Apply water-based paint over oil-based and you get damage. The
paint won't stay on for long. Amateur paint jobs may need
professional help, not only to restore original color, but also
original condition as well.</TE>
<TE>   Original paint that has cracked or faded over time is usually
normal, while crayon or pen marks are obvious damage. What about nail
holes or sun patterns under a painting? Publications suggest life
spans for carpet, paint and drapes run anywhere between two and seven
years. Basically, the longer you've lived in a place, the more likely
items will be considered "worn."</TE>
<TE>   My advice? Doc wear and tear, taking pictures at move-in and
move-out. Think of them as "before" and "after" pictures -- before
there's any problem. If you want to decorate, make it portable. Area
rugs, paintings and designer sheets are yours to buy and keep.</TE>
<TE>   If you damage something, come clean. Ask the landlord if you
should fix it and what to do to repair the damage. Respect the
property and try to keep wear and tear from damaging your deposit.</TE>

<HD>Betting that home prices will cool off</HD>
<DH>Some buyers are holding out for a drop in values. Experts
say don't hold your breath.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Julie Bawden Davis</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Several times a week, Kimberly Locke scans the real estate ads, reads
articles about home buying and checks interest rates. Then she waits.</LD>
<LD>   Locke and her 7-year-old son, David, live in Lakewood. Locke would
like to buy a home in Redondo Beach, near her job and her son's
private school, but she doesn't want to pay what she feels are
inflated prices. So the pair drive 50 miles round-trip each weekday.</LD>
<LD>   "Everything is cyclical, especially the housing market," said
Locke, a widow who plans to keep her Lakewood home as an investment
property. "This is a long-term investment for me, so I want to make
the right decision."</LD>
<TE>   After a brisk year in real estate, with record-high home prices
and rock-bottom interest rates, many people are still waiting on the
sidelines in the hope that the housing "bubble" will burst and that
better buys are in the offing. Experts, on the other hand, say don't
hold your breath.</TE>
<TE>   Prices may flatten out a bit but they're not going to go down,
especially on homes in the $300,000 range, according to Jack Kyser,
chief economist for the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp.
"We have a housing shortage here. In 2000 and 2001, 306,000 people
moved to L.A. County, but we only added 35,000 more housing units."</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, Southern California home prices did drop for a
short time. In June 1991, the median home price was at a high of
$189,000. A year later it had dropped 3.3%, finally bottoming out
four years later in 1995 after it had dropped 12.1%. From there,
however, it took just three years to surpass the 1991 high.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts are not seeing similarities between the early 1990s and
now.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no indication whatsoever of an impending decline in home
prices," said real estate analyst John Karevoll of DataQuick
Information Systems. "We may see the rate of appreciation level off,
but prices aren't going to drop. The [housing] market is at a state
of spectacular equilibrium."</TE>
<TE>   One difference now is that interest rates are at a 40-year low and
homeowners have lower mortgage payments. "What people are committing
themselves to pay today is lower than it was in the spring of 1989,
which isn't taking into account the 42% inflation since then,"
Karevoll said.</TE>
<TE>   Sabrina Anderson and her husband, Wade, are also holding off.</TE>
<TE>   "We have high expectations of what we want in a home, which
includes four bedrooms, a family room and a living room," said
Anderson, who has lived in an apartment above her parent's Placentia
home since she married more than four years ago. "We've been saving
for as big a down payment as possible, so we can get into the kind of
home we want."</TE>
<TE>   But with the median home appreciation rate at 20.1% in Orange
County for the last year and 60.9% over the last four years,
according to DataQuick, the Andersons may have trouble saving enough,
fast enough to ever get into their dream home.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that potential home buyers are ignoring the real estate
market.</TE>
<TE>   "I keep a close eye on what's selling, and I think it's just too
expensive to buy in Southern California right now," said Tustin hair
designer Kathi Cray. "What you pay is not worth what you get. I think
prices are going to drop, though, and then I'll reconsider."</TE>
<TE>   Looking at trends</TE>
<TE>   Not all buyers-in-waiting are holding out for a substantial price
drop, however. Some only have been waiting until the fall and winter
when the home-buying market is generally less competitive. Such is
the case of Suzanne Landon. She has decided to buy in the winter
months after studying real estate trends over the last several years.</TE>
<TE>   "I've monitored the market and seen that prices are lower in the
fall and winter months, and there's less activity overall," said
Landon, who lives in Redondo Beach with her husband, Steven, and
their four children. They are looking for property in the South Bay.
"Our plan is to find a house in the next couple of months and move
when the kids are on Christmas break."</TE>
<TE>   Landon's plan is a sound one, according to real estate broker Dan
Slater, who owns Orange Realty in Orange. A buying frenzy builds in
the spring and summer months, but things slow down considerably in
October, November and December, Slater said.</TE>
<TE>   "In the fall and winter, the buyer has a greater chance of being
able to negotiate and there's less competition," he said. "Sellers
also tend to be highly motivated. Things like divorce, death,
financial difficulties and job transfers often can't wait until after
the holidays."</TE>
<TE>   Though the market may be better for buyers at this time of year,
don't expect a miracle, said Marlene Silva, a Realtor with Pacific
Shores Realty in Redondo Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "A deal is when five people aren't competing for the same
property," she said. "There's more room for negotiation on the part
of the buyer."</TE>
<TE>   The market is not as strong as it was three months ago, agreed
John L. Williams, a manager at Remax Real Estate Services in Monarch
Beach. "We're seeing an increasing inventory, homes on the market a
little longer and more open houses."</TE>
<TE>   There has been no big dip in prices, however, and real estate
agents don't expect that to happen.</TE>
<TE>   While home prices have been rising -- 15.6% in Los Angeles County
during the last year -- interest rates have dipped to below 6%. This
brings up an obvious question: If prices drop but interest rates
rise, won't waiting be counterproductive?</TE>
<TE>   With the rates at such a low, waiting is a lot like playing
Russian roulette, said Paul Hayes, senior loan officer at C &amp; H
Financial in Los Angeles. "You're better off to get in now, before
the rates rise, because they can't go much lower. Wait until interest
rates do rise, and even if prices fall some, you'll end up paying
more."</TE>
<TE>   Mortgage broker Allan Thomas, with Amerimac, the Realty Financial
Center in Redondo Beach, agreed. "Assuming that prices drop as much
as 10% [which is not likely] and interest rates increase by only 1%
[likely], your payment will be the same in the end, only you'll pay
more interest over the life of the loan," Thomas said. "If interest
rates rise and prices stay the same, then you're really losing out."</TE>
<TE>   Interest rates are likely to rise by the beginning of the year,
according to economist Kyser.</TE>
<TE>   "The Federal Reserve is expected to start raising the federal
funds rate in the second quarter of 2003. The money markets will
anticipate this and interest rates on mortgages and bonds will start
to rise," Kyser said. "Interest rates will start rising in the
beginning of 2003 and will reach 7% or higher by the end of the
year."</TE>
<TE>   Considering this likelihood, Silva recommends that buyers weigh
their reasons for waiting and look at the numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're looking at a property that is $400,000 at 6% interest
or less, and the interest rate rises to 7%, how much more will you be
paying per month and over the next 30 years?" she asked. "How much
will home prices have to drop for it to be worth the wait, and is
that realistic?"</TE>
<TE>   But for those still undecided, timing will be critical.</TE>
<TE>   "If you see any indication of interest rates going up, jump in,"
Thomas said. "Remember that interest rates affect how much you're
going to pay and how much of a loan you can afford."</TE>

<HD>A NEW ZING IN THE BRUSSELS ZEITGEIST</HD>
<DH>THE CITY OF OLD-WORLD CHARMS HAS BEEN REVITALIZED, THANKS
TO COSMOPOLITAN FOLK PULLED IN BY THE EUROPEAN UNION</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SPANO</AU>
<BD>Susan Spano last wrote for the magazine on the
Seychelles Islands.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Gray cloud used to hang over Brussels. You could see it in the fall
as rain and wind blew in from the North Sea, but it was there on
those rare sunny days as well.</LD>
<LD>   That was what I thought when I spent a weekend in the city about a
decade ago, and afterward the impression persisted. Brussels was the
butt of jokes. Too boring, bourgeois and buttoned-up for bons
vivants, it was perennially bypassed on the grand tour. It was a
place where people drank beer instead of wine and ate horsemeat pot
au feu. It was an hour and a half by train and light years away from
Paris.</LD>
<LD>   "Small country, small people," said Leopold II, the king of
Belgium from 1865 to 1909.</LD>
<TE>   Old Leopold, who was wrong about many things, would stroke his
beard in consternation to see today's Brussels. It was never that
dull to begin with. It's still the capital of a small country tucked
between France and the Netherlands, but it's also the headquarters of
the European Union, the collection of 15 European countries that
together boast the second-strongest economy in the world. The cloud
over Brussels is lifting to reveal a city changed by corporate and
political players drawn to the burgeoning EU. These well-heeled,
polyglot, cosmopolitan people, who may wish they'd been assigned to
posts in London or Paris, are putting some zing in the city's
zeitgeist, whether they know it or not.</TE>
<TE>   When I went back in early September to spend two weeks with my
sister and brother-in-law, I could hear evidence of the
transformation on the streets where almost everyone, it seems, speaks
several languages. Brussels has started to spruce up its manifold
shaggy parks and pay long-needed attention to its architectural
masterpieces, which go well beyond such famous tourist attractions as
the Grand Place. In trendy neighborhoods such as Uccle and Ixelles,
distinguished old townhouses and apartment buildings with Art Nouveau
flourishes are being renovated to make room for the EU crowd. And on
virtually every corner, intimate new restaurants, cafes and bistros
are opening with menus that make the celebrated mussels and fries
seem about as inventive as meatloaf. Candles flicker, people linger
and windows fog as the rooms heat up with high spirits and
conversation.</TE>
<TE>   Those who think of Brussels as a blank-faced "Euroghetto" with a
handful of washed-up charms should get beyond the Grand Place. They
should take the tram down wide, elegant, sycamore-lined Avenue
Louise, visit the perfect Art Nouveau ensemble that was the home and
studio of Victor Horta, the architect and designer who dotted
Brussels with masterworks, and see Leopold II's grand triumphal arch
in the Parc du Cinquantenaire, financed by blood money from the
Belgian Congo. They should stand back and look again at Brussels, as
I did.</TE>
<TE>   It would, of course, be folly to ignore the city's beloved old
charms. All roads lead to the Grand Place, a venerable Flemish
Renaissance central square and one of Europe's great architectural
set pieces, miraculously preserved despite the ravages of time and
war. To stand on its cobblestones, surrounded by 16th and 17th
century guildhouses, all decorated in a whirligig of gilt and stone,
is to take a short course in European history and have your heart
lifted.</TE>
<TE>   In the Maison du Roi, a museum on the northeast side of the Grand
Place, I saw a huge, lush 17th century tapestry based on a design by
Peter Paul Rubens, made at a time when Brussels dominated the
European textile industry; a painting of a village procession
attributed to Peter Brueghel the Elder that reminded me, in its
vividness, of the comic books so adored by the Bruxellois; and a
collection of costumes that have garbed Manneken Pis, the city's
iconic 17th century bronze statue a few blocks away of a little boy
urinating gleefully.</TE>
<TE>   He expresses the earthy sense of humor of the Bruxellois, who,
over the years, have dressed him as Elvis, a French courtier, a
Japanese daimyo and a Boy Scout. Less well known is his sister
statue, erected, out of political correctness, I guess, in 1985. She
is pigtailed Janneken Pis, who squats in response to the call of
nature in a cul de sac several blocks northeast of the Grand Place.</TE>
<TE>   Across from the Maison du Roi is the square's cynosure, the mostly
neo-gothic Hotel de Ville, originally constructed in the 15th century
but renovated throughout the years and further embellished in the
19th. A host of stone gargoyles, saints, burghers and maidens
decorate the facade. Dragon-slaying St. Michael occupies the pinnacle
of the soaring tower, which alone survived French bombardment in
1695. Inside, tourists can see portraits of various French, Dutch,
Spanish and Austrian rulers of Brussels (Belgium didn't become an
independent nation, with its own monarchy, until 1830), and the
tapestry-lined Council Hall, where the burgomaster, or mayor, of
Brussels still presides over meetings. Touristy shops, currency
exchange booths, art galleries and sidewalk cafes, most of negligible
interest, surround the Grand Place. Consider: Paid admission to the
Belgian Brewers Museum offers access to displays about contemporary
brewing and a beer, donated by members of the Belgian Brewers
association.</TE>
<TE>   Brussels and beer are like Naples and pizza. At home I seldom
touch the stuff and wasn't inclined to change my ways in Brussels, as
marvelous French wines are on offer at restaurants and cafes. Still,
I came to appreciate Leffe blonde, a sophisticated blend of malted
barley and wheat, and sparkling cherry-flavored Krieks, based on a
recipe using heirloom hops. Impressively, each beer is served in its
own kind of glass, most of which seem to be on display at the Beer
Temple, one of a handful of compelling shops near the Grand Place.</TE>
<TE>   Other noteworthy shops include Monsel Parapluies, a small, elegant
umbrella emporium in the glass-roofed Galeries Royales de St. Hubert,
Europe's first shopping arcade, built in 1847. Between the Grand
Place and the Bourse, a neoclassical temple that originally served as
the city's stock exchange, I found Dandoy Biscuiterie, which smells
of spice and specializes in the delicious little cookies that
routinely come when you order a cup of tea at a cafe. And just off
the Grand Place on Rue de la Colline is a boutique dedicated to the
comic strip hero Tintin, an intrepid young reporter with a cowlick
who says things like "Great snakes!"</TE>
<TE>   You can't claim to have exhausted the Grand Place area, however,
without a visit to the nearby Rue de Bouchers, lined by seafood
restaurants and cafes that proudly show their wares on tables heaped
with the catch of the day from the cold North Sea--sole, turbot,
callibaud, oysters and mussels. Advised by friends of my sister and
brother-in-law, I chose Chez Leon, where I ordered a prix fixe lunch,
beginning with a Leffe blonde and a tomato stuffed with tiny, intense
tasting shrimp. Then it was on to the Brussels classic, fries and
mussels.</TE>
<TE>   Belgium and France both claim to have invented French fries
(though the tuber came to Europe from the Americas around 1600), and,
I must say, I've had better fries (dipped in mayonnaise, not ketchup)
in Amsterdam. But rarely have I tasted shellfish as good as Chez
Leon's mussels, steamed in cream with leeks, celery and parsley. The
Bruxellois use an empty shell as tongs to extract the meat and scoop
up the sumptuous soup that remains at the bottom of the bowl after
they've polished off the mussels.</TE>
<TE>   North and West of the grand place, tourist sights peter out. Among
the few worth seeing are the distinguished belle epoque Hotel
Metropole on the Place de Brouckere; the grandiose Theatre Royal de
la Monnaie, where riots started that led to the liberation of Belgium
from Holland in 1830, and Place des Martyrs, a neoclassical beauty
that has been under renovation since my last visit to the city, at
least.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruxellois have been slow to preserve their architectural
heritage. Some works by Horta were demolished, though the remains of
the 1899 Maison du Peuple were salvaged for re-creation of the
building in Antwerp.</TE>
<TE>   A textile warehouse designed by Horta in 1903 has been gorgeously
restored, however. On the Rue des Sables, about a 10-minute walk
northeast of the Grand Place, it now serves as the Belgian Center for
Comic Strip Art, dedicated to the love affair between the Bruxellois
and their cartoons. Its exhibits explain how comic books are made and
explore the careers of such famous artists as Peyo, creator of "Johan
and Peewit,"a marvelous Medieval epic told comic book style. Georges
Remi, who signed his Tintin strips Herge, gets special attention, and
a statue of Tintin with his dog Snowy is in the museum's glorious
glass-roofed atrium.</TE>
<TE>   South of the Grand Place, there's more to see. During my
peregrinations one day, I wandered in to the Galerie Bortier, another
19th century shopping arcade that runs between Rues St. Jean and de
la Madeleine and is dedicated to books. In a gallery tucked between
bookshops, I took in a photographic exhibition on terrorism that
included unforgettable pictures of the crumbling World Trade Center
towers, and then scavenged sales bins for used volumes of Tintin in
French.</TE>
<TE>   From there it takes about 10 minutes, on foot, to reach the
Marolles, an old workers quarter that includes the step-gabled house
of Peter Brueghel the Elder. Reincarnated as Brussels' hippest
neighborhood, it's reminiscent of the East Village in New York. One
night in the Marolles, I attended an avant-garde dance theater
performance at the deconsecrated 17th century Church of the
Brigittines, and on a breezy Sunday morning I wandered up and down
the Rues Haute and Blaes, lined with funky cafes, art galleries and
antique shops selling everything from African masks to Louis XVI
chandeliers.</TE>
<TE>   The neighborhood's heart is the Place du Jeu de Balle, the scene
of a popular Sunday morning flea market. There I bought a vintage
nightshirt for $15 and had a quiche and salad brunch at Indigo, where
the menus are printed by hand on paperback copies of Agatha Christie
mysteries, featuring the prissy Belgian detective Hercule Poirot.</TE>
<TE>   A public elevator at the edge of the Marolles takes pedestrians up
to the Place Poelaert, dominated by the huge neoclassical Palais de
Justice, built between 1866 and 1883. Near its threshold is a
sculptural memorial to Belgian infantrymen who died in World War I
and II and a promenade overlooking the spires and gables of Brussels.
Standing there, you get a sense of how topography divides the city
into two towns, the lower, emanating out from the Grand Place, and
the upper to the east, climbing to the neighborhood surrounding the
Grand Place du Sablon, Parc de Bruxelles and Jardin d'Egmont, Palais
Royal and Musees Royaux des Beaux-Arts.</TE>
<TE>   I'd visited the Beaux-Arts, with its Brueghels and Rene Magrittes,
on my last trip to Brussels. So this time, I sampled some of the
other smaller museums in the upper town, such as the Musical
Instrument Museum in a handsomely restored Art Nouveau department
store, with stunning city views from its top-floor cafe. When you buy
an admission ticket, you get a headset that plays recordings of the
instruments you pass while touring the exhibits: Indian sitars,
Scottish bagpipes, 16th century virginals, and the saxophone,
invented by Belgian Adolphe Sax.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby is the Musee de la Dynastie, devoted to Belgium's royal
family, established in 1830 when the fledgling nation invited
Leopold, Duke of Saxe-Coburg, to become its first king. There have
been just five Belgian monarchs since then, a mixed lot including
Leopold II, who held the Belgian Congo and its enslaved people as his
personal fiefdom before ceding it in 1908, as Adam Hochschild
documents in his compelling book "King Leopold's Ghost." Leopold II's
cane is on display, together with a segment of rope used by Albert I
during the climbing accident that took his life in 1934 and toy
soldiers that belonged to widely beloved Badouin I, who ruled the
country from 1951 to 1993.</TE>
<TE>   The museum district is the most chic part of Brussels, centered
around the lovely diminutive Place du Petit Sablon, a formal garden
with a cascading fountain surrounded by 48 bronze statues
representing the city's Medieval guilds and done by Art Nouveau
artist Paul Hankar. Its northwest edge opens onto the Place du Grand
Sablon, lined with fine art and antiques dealers, and confectioneries
such as Wittamer and Pierre Marcolini, considered by connoisseurs to
be Brussels' best chocolatier.</TE>
<TE>   I lunched on the terrace at Wittamer, taking time over my delicate
little chicken salad sandwiches and watching the Bruxellois walk
their dogs. They all seem to have them, and Jack Russells and yellow
Labs seem to be favored.</TE>
<TE>   And I mean favored. One night my sister, brother-in-law and I ate
at the vaunted and very formal La Truffe Noire. Dinner for two there,
with wine, can easily cost $500, and as soon as you sit down, the
maitre d' lets you sniff from a glass canister of black truffles,
redolent of the dark forests in France and Italy where they are
found. So we noted with some amazement that a lady at a table nearby
had a dog. As she left, my sister asked her if the pooch ate
truffles. "Oh, yes," the woman said. "He likes them very much."</TE>
<TE>   Quartier Leopold, a 15-minute tram ride east of the Grand Place,
is the center of operations for 31,500 employees of the sprawling EU
and some 10,000 lobbyists. The Bruxellois disparagingly call it a
"Euroghetto," partly because so many people had to move to the
suburbs when the neighborhood's 19th century apartment buildings and
townhouses were leveled to make room for undistinguished modern EU
office blocks.</TE>
<TE>   The huge glass and granite European Parliament building fits the
Euroghetto label somewhat. Still, it wraps partway around Parc
Leopold, a vestige of belle epoque Brussels currently under
renovation, and overlooks the eccentric little Musee Wiertz. Antoine
Wiertz, a 19th century Belgian artist, painted awful monumental
canvases based on history and mythology. When one of them was
indifferently received at the Paris Salon of 1839, he fought back by
writing a vitriolic pamphlet titled "Brussels Capital, Paris
Province."</TE>
<TE>   The Parliament building doesn't suggest that Brussels is the
capital of anything. But the tour is a fascinating lesson about
government-in-the-making and a reminder of the potential strength of
the nascent EU. Visitors are given headsets when they arrive,
yielding audio interpretation in all 11 languages of the EU. My
group, composed mostly of young, well-mannered Europeans, saw the
horseshoe-shaped debating chamber, where Parliament members are
seated by political party, not home country, and cannot filibuster
because their microphones are simply turned off if they speak too
long.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1958, when Brussels became the headquarters of the European
Economic Community, a precusor of the EU, some 80,000 pages of
regulations aimed chiefly at harmonizing the differences between
constituent states have streamed out of offices in the Quartier
Leopold. In "Travels as a Brussels Scout," the English humorist Nick
Middleton warns that the union could fall victim to its own bloated
bureaucracy. "And the only thing left would be billions of pieces of
paper with stupid rules written on them," he quips. At the nearby
European Info Point on Rue de la Loi, I collected a wad of these
regulations brochures on customs, women and job-seeking, though I
don't know what I'll ever do with them.</TE>
<TE>   The Parc Cinquantenaire spreads eastward from the Quartier
Leopold, built chiefly by Leopold II to commemorate the 50th
anniversary of the Belgian nation. Three grand triumphal arches
overlook its central lawns and tree-lined walkways, with museums on
either side. I visited the Musees Royaux d'Art et d'Histoire, a
capacious respository of the decorative arts, anthropology and
archeology under a prepossessing dome. I had the museum's smashing
collection of tapestry, Gothic retables and Art Nouveau furniture
virtually to myself, apparently because few tourists make it to the
Parc Leopold.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer still have the time or inclination to explore Ixelles, one
of the 19 communes that make up the city. I did in an easygoing way,
without agendas, because Ixelles is where my family lives, about a
30-minute tram ride south of the Grand Place.</TE>
<TE>   There I discovered the lakes that lead to the 13th century Abbaye
de la Cambre and secretive little Parc Tenbosch, where people play
boules (like lawn bowling) after work. I could easily walk from my
sister and brother-in-law's to the circa 1900 home and studio of
Victor Horta, which is open for tours, and the exquisite David and
Alice van Buuren Musuem, where a financier and his wife decorated
their rather plain brick house in the best styles of the early 20th
century.</TE>
<TE>   On almost every block in Ixelles, there's a patisserie and a proud
traiteur, such as Maison Felix on Rue Washington, selling specialty
foods to cook at home and prepared delicacies such as pate. On
Wednesdays, market stalls fill the pleasant Place du Chatelain, some
dedicated solely to endive, mushrooms or chocolates.</TE>
<TE>   Brand-name chocolates abound in Brussels, of course. But when you
taste the creations of an independent chocolatier such as Laurent
Gerbaud, who has a booth at the Place du Chatelain market, you
understand why some people need chocolate like narcotics. Gerbaud
told me he uses neither sugar or butter in his confections, just
cream and cacao.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Brussels' best new restaurants have turned up in
Ixelles--Cafe Camille, with pictures of cowboys on the walls;
Quincaillerie, in an Art Deco hardware store; and, above all, En Face
de Parachute, which takes its name from an upscale clothing store
across the street.</TE>
<TE>   By the time we dined there, I'd already eaten well around
Brussels, but En Face de Parachute, in a small candlelit room that
used to be a pharmacy, provided my favorite meal. I started with a
salad of spinach and foie gras, which was followed by the most
remarkable seafood pot au feu, with shrimp, lobster and at least
three different kinds of fish, so fresh they may as well still have
been swimming in the North Sea. I concluded with three kinds of
sorbet for dessert.</TE>
<TE>   It was raining by the time we left, but if there was a gray cloud
in the sky I couldn't see it.</TE>

<HD>CAPE TOWN'S DOUBLE DELIGHTS</HD>
<DH>ON ONE SIDE OF LANDMARK TABLE MOUNTAIN LIES A SOPHISTICATED
CITY WITH NEW COSMOPOLITAN SIZZLE. ON THE OTHER, ECCENTRIC OLD-WORLD
VILLAGES DOT A WIND-SWEPT COASTLINE.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TED BOTHA</AU>
<BD>Ted Botha last wrote for the magazine about the
Dominican Republic.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One morning in January, the height of summer in South Africa, I took
a walk on Table Mountain. The group I was with included a bearded
historian from the University of Cape Town, a businessman and his
wife, a lawyer, and an attractive female architect who also edits an
Interview-like magazine called ADA. They all make a habit of getting
up early every Sunday and hiking one of the innumerable slopes above
their city.</LD>
<LD>   Because Cape Town is spread across a 30-mile-long peninsula, where
a mountainous ridge runs down its middle like a curvaceous geological
vertebrae, the choice of climbs (as well as the views you get from
them) is virtually endless. Starting at the Sphinx-like Signal Hill
and Lion's Head that overlook the city center, the vertebrae spread
out to Table Mountain and Devil's Peak, carry on down the vast Twelve
Apostles and the precipitous Chapman's Peak, curve into the recesses
of Silvermine and Red Hill, and end at Cape Point, where the land
falls away into the tempestuous sea at the southern tip of Africa.</LD>
<TE>   I don't hike much in the U.S., but in Cape Town you can hardly
avoid it--nor do you want to. Like Los Angeles, the city literally
smacks of good health and exercise. Paragliders leap off Lion's Head
to land between the bathers on the beach at Camps Bay, cyclists whiz
along the road that's etched into the hillside above the Atlantic
seaboard, every car seems to have a surfboard attached to it, and
people glow with sunny health. Even the restaurant menus have a
proclivity toward fresh fish and hearty salads. In no city I've ever
visited, not even L.A., is the air of well-being and relaxation so
pervasive.</TE>
<TE>   And what better place to share in this spirit than on Table
Mountain, which is in the midst of everything. One of the most
unmistakable mounds of earth on Earth, the 3,000-foot-high mesa-like
landmark guards Cape Town as much as it divides it, keeping fog to
one side when there's sun on the other, holding wind from rain, and
separating two worlds: Table Bay and False Bay. So geologically
fractious is it that Capetonians give directions accordingly: A place
is either in front of the mountain or behind it.</TE>
<TE>   On this particular Sunday morning, though, i was going onto the
mountain itself, and by the looks of it so were plenty of other
people. By the time I reached the narrow road that bisects the
flattop like a thin layer of icing in a cake, there were long lines
for the cable car, the easier way up, while small groups of hikers
were limbering up for the ascent by foot. One of those groups was
mine.</TE>
<TE>   The magazine editor, Jenny Sorrell, was our leader, and she set an
easy pace up the steep climb. We stopped frequently to catch our
breath, only to lose it all over again while sighing at the views
below us.</TE>
<TE>   The coastline of Table Bay stretches in a long crescent, beginning
at the Victoria &amp; Alfred Waterfront and the main harbor and then
going around to the surfer and windsurfer beach of choice,
Bloubergstrand, otherwise known as Big Bay. On the other side of
Lion's Head and Signal Hill, which make up the rest of the
mountainous amphitheater overlooking the city, lies the Atlantic
seaboard. From where we stood, we couldn't see the so-called Riviera
of Cape Town--Clifton, Camps Bay and Bantry Bay--but it is close
enough for locals to designate it, too, as "the front of the
mountain."</TE>
<TE>   In the middle of the bay is Robben Island, all green and flat on
the sparkling sea. Looking at it then, from on high, it was hard to
imagine that for nearly four centuries it had been used for exile.
The most recent (and very last) of the people jailed there were
political prisoners, punished for fighting apartheid. The most famous
prisoner, Nelson Mandela, was freed in 1990. Four years later he
became South Africa's first democratically elected president.</TE>
<TE>   On a previous visit to the country, several years after Mandela
had ushered in a constitution said to be the most liberal in the
world, two things struck me: the huge number of changes that
democracy had wrought and the small number of tourists who were
coming to see them.</TE>
<TE>   The popular belief back then was that foreigners were waiting for
a sign that the country was "safe." Or would it become another
African statistic? In the meantime, a land tailor-made for
tourism--from the animal-rich game parks like Kruger, to the
subtropical seaside city of Durban, to the snowy peaks of the
Drakensberg--sat waiting. As for the gem in the crown, Cape Town, it
seemed to be drawing more breathless comparisons than visitors: It
Was San Diego With Mountains, Vancouver But Warm, The Next Sydney,
San Francisco Without Bad Weather. For me it remained, quite simply,
One of the World's Best-Kept Secrets.</TE>
<TE>   Until now.</TE>
<TE>   After only a few days, I could tell that something exciting was
afoot. It lingered in the air as unmistakably as the curried samosas
being fried in the former Malay Quarter, now called Bo-Kaap (which
means "above cape"); the suntan oil rising off the bodies on Clifton
beach; and the myriad foreign accents on the streets. The city was
finally being discovered.</TE>
<TE>   Restaurants had multiplied, and they weren't just the
garden-variety pasta-and-pizza joints that you had found in the past.
They were seafood places and serious kitchens manned by such chefs as
Garth Stroebel of the Mount Nelson Hotel and Graeme Shapiro of The
Restaurant, who were exploring the Cape's spice-rich culinary
history, which could be traced back to slaves brought from Malaysia
in the 18th century. The V&amp;A Waterfront had doubled in size, but
still managed to keep a wonderful balance between a working harbor
and a place to find a superb meal and one of the world's top hotels,
the Cape Grace.</TE>
<TE>   Best of all, people were getting out and staying out. This struck
me the night before the hike, when I was sitting at a small cafe
called the Daily Deli under Lion's Head. The last time I'd visited
Cape Town, the deli had been a small mom-and-pop operation that
closed at dusk. It still served coffee and pastries, but now it
stayed open late and you could sit outside. At midnight, the place
was still full of people seated outdoors, sipping cappuccinos.</TE>
<TE>   The same scenario was playing out all over Cape Town, as if
restaurants--from bistros on Adderley Street to the smallest cafe in
Camps Bay--had suddenly caught on to the fact that the city is
blessed with eight months of great weather a year. And judging by the
proliferation of people eating and drinking alfresco, everyone was
determined to get in on the action. Cape Town never looked so
cosmopolitan.</TE>
<TE>   Culturally, too, it was more vibrant than ever. Right before going
to the deli, I'd been to a knockout show in Green Point that was
worthy of any big-city boite, where two lip-synching transvestites
mimicked every female artist from Helen Reddy to Donna Summer. When I
told my fellow hikers about this, during one of our many orange
breaks, they all recounted similar evenings.</TE>
<TE>   One couple had gone to a performance of "Tosca" on the Spier wine
estate in the nearby town of Stellenbosch. The academic and some
friends had watched Second New Year, the annual Mardi Gras-like
gathering of hundreds of Coloured (South Africa's term for
mixed-race) minstrels dressed in bright silk costumes who parade
through Green Point. The lawyer's family had picnicked at a jazz
concert on the lawn of Kirstenbosch botanical gardens.</TE>
<TE>   The only one of us who hadn't ventured out--oddly enough,
considering her status as a local celebrity--was Sorrell, who had
gone to work. But, as she pointed out, that was pretty much like
being at a party. Her office, it seems, overlooks Long Street, a
downtown artery whose revitalization epitomizes what has happened in
Cape Town. It once used to shut at 5, like the surrounding offices,
but now things only start buzzing after 5.</TE>
<TE>   "I can open my window and listen to live music," Sorrell beamed,
"and I can go out at 2 in the morning and still get an espresso."</TE>
<TE>   Sorrell was a good person to reacquaint me with Cape Town, a city
I'd lived in during the last years of apartheid. She covers every
scene from the latest in interior decorating to the hottest township
music, publicizing it in her magazine and in a series of funky maps
that she designs. As Cape Town has grown, so have the maps, which
began with arts and crafts, then went on to food; the body, mind and
spirit; the gay community; and places to get married.</TE>
<TE>   When I browsed through the maps later, I noticed that most of the
destinations are on Table Bay or the Atlantic seaboard--in "front" of
the mountain. Those behind are in the suburbs: the wine region of
Constantia or part of the stylish Claremont shopping belt. But False
Bay? Despite being many times larger than its sister bay, it doesn't
have nearly the same number of restaurants, boutiques and trendy
attractions. So it is left largely unmentioned.</TE>
<TE>   But for me, its less-than-chic otherworldliness is part of False
Bay's charm. It is the yin to Table Bay's yang, the day to its night,
the Old World to its New. On Table Bay, the mood is vibrant, the cars
are more likely to be BMW convertibles, models jostle for tables at
the restaurants in Heritage Square, women bathe topless, and the
rocks at Bakoven are the place to hang out at sunset. On False Bay,
the mood is more rarefied, many of the streets are still cobbled, the
cars are older and rustier, you can often hear whales snorting close
to shore late at night, fresh fish get sold roadside, and the best
place to see the sunrise is, well, anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   The morning I drove to False Bay, fog covered the city. but as
soon as I got behind the mountain, it disappeared and the weather was
perfect. I skirted Kirstenbosch gardens and the vineyards of
Constantia until the back of Table Mountain was behind me and
Muizenberg, the gateway to the other side of Cape Town's coastline,
was in front.</TE>
<TE>   When I got there, the sea was covered with dozens of wannabe
surfers (this being the ideal place for beginners), who floated like
a posse of lethargic black seals. A half-moon of beach stretched as
far as the eye could see, and on the far side of the bay, some 30
miles away, loomed a formidable range of mountains. Its name,
paradoxically, combines the original inhabitants of the Cape with the
settlers who contributed to their extermination, the Hottentots
Hollands.</TE>
<TE>   Not many people remember it, but False Bay used to be the Table
Bay of yesteryear, and the haute monde flocked there like they do to
the other side of the mountain today. The most favored destination
was Muizenberg--which is pronounced like a famous car of the time,
the Duesenberg--and the reason was obvious. The water, being in a
more protected bay and close to the Indian Ocean, wasn't as turbulent
or as cold as the Atlantic side. So vacationers caught the train from
Cape Town to spend the weekend, and millionaires built mansions along
the beachfront.</TE>
<TE>   Cecil John Rhodes, the diamond magnate and creator of the famed
scholarship, lived out his final years there; and an Italian prince,
Natale Labia, tried to turn it into a little Venice. As if the
landscape weren't Italian enough (stone pines dot the hillsides and
the Constantia vineyards are centuries old), he made it even more so.
He built a pink palazzo, furnished it with Italian finery, and
planned a series of canals in the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   But somewhere along the way the millionaires moved on, the Labia
villa became a museum, and Table Bay beaches--once deemed too cold
for swimming--became hot. Today the Muizenberg mansions have been cut
up into boarding houses, Nigerian immigrants sleep six to a room, and
the old synagogue, though maintained, no longer has a congregation.
This is partly why towns on the False Bay coast appear on most
itineraries, if at all, as names to bypass on the road to Cape Point.</TE>
<TE>   If only people knew what they were missing. Along the roughly 12
miles that stretch between Muizenberg and Simonstown, the final town
on this coast, lies a series of village-like suburbs that, though
they often blend into one another, have a distinct character. They
also have plenty of characters: men covered in tattoos, old
British-looking colonials walking along the seaside. It's a mix of
Venice (the one in California), Greece and Cornwall, England.</TE>
<TE>   The names, especially, are British-sounding. Clovelly is so small
you could miss it, while next door, Fish Hoek, with the largest beach
and the most sheltered bay within the bigger bay, draws the most
bathers and catamarans. In more affluent St. James, the tiny beach is
backed by a clutch of colorful Victorian-era wooden changing rooms on
stilts.</TE>
<TE>   One of the last buildings I passed before leaving Muizenberg was a
red-brick railway station on the sea. I'd heard it was modeled on one
in Delft, Holland, perhaps by someone trying to re-create the
Netherlands the same way Prince Labia tried to re-create Italy.</TE>
<TE>   In the old days, the station was where vacationers used to alight
before heading to one of the small hotels that were the resort's
stock in trade. People on holiday still catch the train today,
although the thrill is not to get there but to depart from there on a
seaside tour. The ride south to Simonstown is one of Cape Town's
little-publicized treats, not anywhere as popular as the cable car up
Table Mountain, but this side's equivalent for stunning views of the
bay. The coaches run so close to the water you can almost stretch
your hand out a window and touch the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   I followed the road to Simonstown, making my first stop in the
small fishing harbor of Kalk Bay. The boats had come in by late
morning, trailed by a dozen seals waiting for tidbits of fish that
might fall overboard. The air was filled with the voices of fishermen
and the shrill calls of women waiting to buy the latest haul of snoek
(pronounced "snook"), a local fish similar to barracuda.</TE>
<TE>   Like Cape Town's Malaysian Bo-Kaap district, Kalk Bay escaped one
of the worst acts of apartheid: forced removals. In the 1960s and
'70s, thousands of mixed-race families from across the city were
moved en masse to Mitchells Plain, a sandy expanse between the two
bays, in order to enforce the laws regulating where different races
lived. But many of the fishermen of Kalk Bay weren't uprooted. This
has left the village with a spirit and flavor all its own.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years others have found a haven here, too: potters, book
dealers and surfers, as well as bric-a-brac stores piled high with
secondhand goods. Since my last visit, the businesses had been
polished up and several upscale shops selling art and good food had
squeezed into the convivially congested main road, where second-floor
balconies literally hang over the traffic--not unlike the look of
Bourbon Street in New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   The contrast of the fishermen walking by the stylish entrances was
stark, but, as always in Kalk Bay, it couldn't have been more
natural. So, too, was breakfast at the Olympia Cafe &amp; Deli, an eatery
opposite the harbor that is rough-and-ready but perfect. It's only a
matter of time, I thought, before it's featured in one of Sorrell's
maps.</TE>
<TE>   The route out of Kalk Bay hugged the coast, and it was hard to
keep my eyes on the road, what with the views around each corner.
There was a much more understated feel there than in front of the
mountain, and for the first time I knew what it meant to say The Same
But Different.</TE>
<TE>   Homes are built up the hillsides as they are on the Atlantic side.
But rather than being big, white and open to the sea, they are older
and quirkier. The water is still a blue that makes you want to pull
over and jump in--except there, with so much available parking and
accessible beaches, it's possible to do that almost anywhere. Seals
and gannets are more likely than humans to be sunning themselves on
the rocks. And rather than yachts cutting through the waves, Southern
Right whales leap playfully out of the sea and fall onto their backs
in a crash of spray.</TE>
<TE>   As a haze settled over the bay, making the Hottentots Hollands
disappear, it was easy to forget that False Bay was a bay at all.
Sailors in the 16th century were similarly confused by the coastline.
At that time, the Cape was used as a pit stop on the way to and from
India, and boats on their way home to Europe thought they were
passing Cape Point when they'd actually taken one corner too early.
Sometimes they sailed as far into the bay as Muizenberg before they
realized their mistake. The wrong turn occurred so often, it was
immortalized in its "False" name.</TE>
<TE>   Today's mariners, ironically, are based in Simonstown, South
Africa's main naval town and the last major outpost before Cape Point
and the Cape of Good Hope. When I got there, it was like driving into
an English seaside resort, only one that has good weather, palm trees
and an old mosque up one of the side streets. Buildings are
whitewashed and have ornate grillwork on their balconies, sailors
wear starched uniforms, and Jubilee Square is built around the statue
of a famous navy dog called Just Nuisance.</TE>
<TE>   Heading south again, near the end of Simonstown, I turned down a
steep lane that leads to Boulders Beach. But the reason most people
go here is not for the beach--although the still, clear water makes
it wonderful for that, too--but to visit the colony of jackass
penguins who have made it their home. Even before I got to the
boulders, I found penguins huddled in the cool shade of bushes
(although beware the smell that lingers on windless days). Others
preened themselves on the rocks, occasionally interrupting their
titivating to let out their donkey-like cry or waddle into the water
between the human swimmers.</TE>
<TE>   Later, as the road out of Simonstown climbed higher, the signs of
human development trickled away, a signal that I was nearing the end
of the geological vertebrae. Baboons stood patrol above Smitswinkel
Bay in a sullen kind of way--they'd probably read the "Don't Feed
Baboons" signs--and then the road turned inland.</TE>
<TE>   At Cape Point, the wind was blowing so hard that people's shirts
were ballooning out and caps were being gripped tightly. The southern
tip of Africa is barely 90 minutes from Table Bay and the front of
the mountain, but also a world away from it. Antelope and baboons
crossed the raw, wind-swept nature reserve, while the ocean was full
of waves and whitecaps, churned up by the meeting of the Benguela and
Agulhas currents going up and coming down either side of the
continent. It was breathtaking in a different way from the views I'd
seen.</TE>
<TE>   Since my last visit, a cute funicular had been installed to take
people to the lighthouse at the highest point. But many chose to walk
up the steep rise instead. This being Cape Town, and having already
cut my chops on Table Mountain, so did I.</TE>

<HD>UP ALL NIGHT IN NEW YORK</HD>
<DH>CAN A CITY REALLY BE EASIER TO SEE AFTER THE SUN GOES DOWN?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN KANDELL</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Kandell last wrote for the travel issue of the
magazine about eating in Singapore, the Asian capital of "street
food."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The premise was simple enough: New York prides itself for being "the
city that never sleeps," and having spent much of our lives here, my
wife, Joan, and I decided we would finally prove it ourselves. This
was a chance to discover New York anew--on our terms. We would ignore
the critics' choices-of-the-moment in favor of an eclectic mix of
normally crowded landmarks where even experienced New Yorkers can
feel dwarfed, and of less-visited gems that could make us feel as if
the city had been created just for us.</LD>
<LD>   But, of course, complications arose almost immediately. How to
choose from New York's cornucopia of diversions in those dozen hours
between dusk and dawn? Should we favor a Latino disco over an Irish
music tavern, a Chinese banquet over gourmet Greek food, an art
museum over a Broadway play?</LD>
<LD>   We soon realized our journey to the end of the night required as
much planning as any overseas vacation we'd ever undertaken. We
confined ourselves to Manhattan because traveling to the other
boroughs would take too long. Yet we wanted to visit as many
neighborhoods as possible and expose ourselves to a broad range of
culture, food, entertainment and just plain idiosyncratic behavior.
All places had to be of considerable quality, not just selected
because they stayed open late or could be shoehorned into our
schedule.</LD>
<TE>   Pacing and layering would be important as well. Encounters with
frenzied revelers would alternate with locations where quieter, more
reflective moments were possible. Homage would be rendered equally to
an anointed palace of high culture and a cramped jazz cellar
neglected by the going-out guides. We hoped all our careful
calculations would still leave room for spontaneous, bizarre
incidents that make any voyage more memorable. Finally we chose a
Saturday night for the great adventure, because we would need a full
day's rest before setting out and another full day to recover.</TE>
<TE>   SATURDAY, 7 P.M.</TE>
<TE>   Our odyssey begins on the Upper East Side at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art. The huge main hall reverberates with a Mozart sonata
from a string quartet hidden in the mezzanine above and the less
sublime chatter of a very visible crowd below that is lining up for a
Gauguin show. The Met is terrifically successful at drawing
spectators to temporary blockbuster exhibits. But whatever hasn't
been consecrated as must-see by the New York buzz tends to be
sloughed off, including much of the museum's permanent collection.</TE>
<TE>   This creates great opportunities for art lovers who want to
luxuriate in virtual solitude. Until 9 on a Saturday night, it's
possible to stand in front of a Velazquez or Rembrandt for a dozen
minutes with few visitors in sight. What Joan and I have in mind,
though, is to explore parts of the museum that draw few visitors
during the day. Rather than meander aimlessly, we organize our very
private tour under the theme of "residential interiors"--how the
urban wealthy lived and entertained at home throughout the world and
through the ages, achieving a calm amid chaos that many New Yorkers
would find admirable today.</TE>
<TE>   We start at the Nur Ad-Din Room, a reception space re-created from
a 1707 upper-class house in Damascus. Here was truly an oasis.
Residents and guests were isolated from the heat and noise of the
streets in this serene, aesthetic setting of velvet cushions, marble
floors and carved wood panels. The only sound was the soft, splashing
water from a fountain. Filtered through stained glass windows, harsh
sunlight became soothing and the room stayed cool even in
mid-afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   For a Chinese residence under moonlight, we visit a Ming scholar's
retreat (between the 14th and 17th centuries). In a garden court with
a bubbling stream and limestone boulders eroded into abstract
sculptures, the master of the house and his guests sipped tea and
dedicated poems to the moon. In the adjoining reception room,
furnished with armchairs of purple sandalwood and wall panels inlaid
with veined marble, the scholar sat on his couch reading, writing or
conversing with visitors.</TE>
<TE>   We wander through a late 17th century English bedroom, a French
belle epoque dining room and a Colonial American drawing room. These
spaces are spread across the museum, and we have to resist the
temptation to be pulled off course by Monets and Manets, Medieval
ivories and Renaissance jewels, Ancient Greek and Roman sculptures,
Maya and Inca ceramic figurines. We can spare the Met only 90 minutes
because the rest of Manhattan beckons.</TE>
<TE>   9 P.M.</TE>
<TE>   We emerge from the Canal Street subway stop in Chinatown. When we
were college kids, Chinatown was a mere 20-square-block triangle. But
during the past several decades, the older Cantonese community has
been joined by newer arrivals from Fukien, Hunan, Sichuan and other
provinces. The neighborhood has burst its traditional boundaries and
swallowed up almost all of Little Italy to the north and much of the
formerly Jewish Lower East Side.</TE>
<TE>   It's a cool evening. At this hour, most tourists are gone, and
Chinatown has stopped shoving. Shopkeepers hose sidewalks and clang
down metal shutters. There are a few clubs on the eastern fringes of
the neighborhood. But this is a time when Chinatown becomes the
destination of serious eaters. Walking along Mott Street, we're
tempted by the string of fashionable teahouses serving a
rainbow-colored assortment of iced teas flavored with anything from
litchi nuts to gelatinous tapioca "pearls." On nearby Pell Street, we
consider Joe's Shanghai--home to arguably Chinatown's best Shanghai
cuisine--but there's a waiting line of cognoscenti spilling out the
door.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, we dine at our favorite local restaurant, Dim Sum Go Go,
at 5 E. Broadway on Chatham Square. Despite its name, this nouvelle
Cantonese establishment offers inventive main dishes that often make
us skip the dumplings. Good Cantonese cooking is famed for subtle
sauces and dishes of such clarity that taste buds can identify every
ingredient. We begin with shrimp sauteed with chives, and then some
slightly spicy stir-fried long beans. Beef pan-stirred with young
ginger slices melts with every chew. But the revelation of this
evening is a new entree--steamed minced pork with cilantro,
scallions, celery and topped with Chinese black olives--served in
omelet-like wedges that launch salty, creamy, pungent waves across
the palate.</TE>
<TE>   11 P.M.</TE>
<TE>   A cab drops us off at Broadway and 32nd Street, the heart of
Koreatown. During the day, this is a street of consumer electronic
shops. At night, the floors above the shops are lit by neon signs in
Korean characters, Hangul, that often don't bother with English
translations. Sometimes, all we have to do is follow our noses: the
smoky aroma of grilled beef bulgogi and the garlicky scent of kimchi
make it easy to guess what signs belong to restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   It takes a bit more determination to decipher other neon
scribbles. In one building, we get off at several floors that turn
out to be karaoke bars, where middle-aged men belt out mournful
Korean ballads between drinks with younger hostesses. At a hipper
establishment, Blue, a bar bathed in neon, most tables are occupied
by a private party that sings American country music. We order soju,
a mildly alcoholic drink that looks radioactive blue in the
artificial light but tastes pleasantly sweet and refreshing.
Encouraged by the crowd, we join in a chorus of a recent Garth Brooks
song, following the lyrics on a large screen.</TE>
<TE>   Our intended destination is a nearby bar recommended by friends,
the aptly named Third Floor Cafe, in a building at the southeast
corner of Fifth Avenue. The decor here is elegantly decadent:
alabaster chandeliers, a wood floor and easy chairs and love seats
arranged around coffee tables. The disco and soul music are soft
enough to allow conversation. Out the window, just a block north, the
Empire State Building is suffused in red, white and blue light.</TE>
<TE>   We sit at the long, curving, lacquered wood bar and contemplate
the golden Korean American youth around us. According to our
bartender (the staff consists mostly of young women who seem
cheerfully competent but whose job description surely must include
sheer beauty), the Gap-jeaned, Polo-shirted clientele includes
investment bankers, lawyers, junior partners in family businesses and
MBA students. Men outnumber women by at least 5 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   The patrons are all speaking English, and it occurs to us that, as
first-generation Americans, they might be seeking a transitional
space to call their own between an assimilated New York scene and a
more traditional Korean club setting that their parents' generation
favors. They display none of the boisterousness one expects from
twentysomething males with money to spend on Saturday night. Most of
them serve themselves premium beer from cold metal kegs set up like
samovars at their tables. When cell phones ring, the owners politely
hasten off to a corner to respond. Joan and I agree we will return
another weekend night to enjoy again the flawless apple martinis
served straight up in this sedate setting.</TE>
<TE>   SUNDAY, 1 A.M.</TE>
<TE>   We find a brassier, edgier New York during Caribbean night at Club
Pulse, a disco on East 54th Street. The neighborhood itself is quite
anodyne--architecturally undistinguished apartment and office
buildings and, at street-level, restaurants that cater to
businesspeople. A convoy of stretch limos disgorges passengers at the
club's velvet-roped entrance. Guards wielding metal detectors search
for weapons. Inside Pulse, the bouncers, taking their jobs quite
seriously, survey the crowd and murmur into walkie-talkies.
Tropical-plant sconces on stucco walls underscore the club's
Caribbean motif.</TE>
<TE>   We squeeze onto the sunken dance floor, surrounded by lithe men in
linen suits and satin shirts and shapely women in tight skirts and
spike heels who move with a skill that soon turns us into spectators.
Younger dancers favor acrobatic salsa steps in which the men hoist
their partners onto their thighs. But we're riveted by the 30- to
40-year-olds who glide through merengues like ice skaters, impeccably
in time with the music.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, during a long percussive passage, there is a commotion
in a corner. Dancers move out of the way as four guys kneel down and
pound their palms on the floor. Next to us at the bar, the bouncer
with a WWF build stiffens and draws a deep breath, a man inhaling
trouble. But when the drum-and-cymbal duo ends, the youths, laughing
and slapping high-fives, cede the space back to the dancers and
return to their drinks. "Just their way of keeping time, I guess,"
says a patron sitting next to us. The bouncer offers his own
explanation: "Buncha jerks."</TE>
<TE>   Truth be told, Club Pulse is a fallback choice for us. We would
prefer the Copacabana with its multiple live bands. But the Copa is
closed and scheduled to reopen in new, larger premises this month.
Though we have to settle for recorded music, we have no complaints
about the deejay's selection of old and new: El Gran Combo, Sergio
Vargas, La India, Grupo Mania, Olga Tanon...</TE>
<TE>   3 A.M.</TE>
<TE>   We leave our taxi at Christopher Street in Greenwich Village and
walk a block to Smalls, an all-night jazz club. Manhattan's grid
pattern is compressed into a fish skeleton here in the West Village,
confusing even longtime residents. Smalls is located where West 10th
and 4th streets--normally separated by six blocks--somehow converge.</TE>
<TE>   Smalls is unique, and not only because it closes so much later and
costs far less than more famous clubs. The nearby Village Vanguard
and Blue Note function like clockwork, with every set on time, and
draw the biggest names in jazz. Smalls is where not-so-famous
musicians who have finished gigs elsewhere drift by to jam. It's also
a place where younger amateurs, with stardust in their eyes, hope to
be noticed by the pros.</TE>
<TE>   We pay $10 each and step down into a classic, dark jazz cellar.
Yellowing photos of great musicians line the smoke-stained walls. The
only drinks served are coffee, tea and lemonade--free. Some customers
bring their own bag-wrapped liquor, pouring it furtively into plastic
cups. We're fortunate to find the last available table, and even
luckier that Frank Hewitt, the veteran pianist, is onstage with his
trio. Always a self-effacing musician, Hewitt accompanied Billie
Holiday and Dinah Washington when he was young. It was one of his
last performances. He died of cancer last month.</TE>
<TE>   Between sets, we chat with a saxophonist and a bass player, both
recent Middlebury grads who performed on the college circuit but are
making their first appearance at Smalls, accompanying a pianist who
is a bit older and more experienced. The sax player admits he's both
excited and nervous because he recognizes a recording executive in
the audience. "That guy sitting against the wall--he's from Verve,"
he says, gesturing to a semiconscious recording label rep in a tux
with his bow tie undone.</TE>
<TE>   It starts off badly for the Middlebury guys when they go onstage.
The sax player cuts in several times during the piano solos, and the
bassist misses his cue at least twice. But by the end of the
set--with a plaintive version of "Good Morning, Heartache"--the trio
gels. The audience, many of them friends of the aspirants, applaud so
lustily that the Verve guy wakes up with a look of surprise and
manages a few vigorous claps.</TE>
<TE>   We stagger out of Smalls into the Sunday dawn. Even the most jaded
New Yorkers would recognize the magic of a moment like this one. The
streets are deserted except for songbirds. The early sunlight unveils
ivy-covered brick townhouses against a mighty horizon of skyscrapers.
A feeling that the city is ours alone induces giddy optimism and
laughter. We consider breaking into a waltz or tango . . . if only we
had a bit more energy. Instead, we opt for a restorative breakfast at
Florent a few blocks north and west.</TE>
<TE>   5:30 A.M.</TE>
<TE>   Located in the meatpacking district, Florent is a 1950s-style
diner with red vinyl stools, Formica-topped tables, and mirrors and
metal walls that amplify the nostalgic music. The Supremes order us
to stop in the name of love, and Sinatra has us under his skin. All
around us are young Europeans comparing notes on their extended "lost
weekend" in New York before flying home later today. "C'est pas
vrai!" exclaims a Parisian woman upon being informed by friends that
she missed out on a Lord &amp; Taylor sale. At one table sits a cluster
of transvestites. Wigs off, makeup streaking down their faces and
dresses wrinkled, they demonstrate a touching camaraderie. When a
waitress approaches, we realize we're famished and order the kind of
breakfast we rarely have--scrambled eggs, bacon, pancakes and a pot
of strong coffee.</TE>
<TE>   6:30 A.M.</TE>
<TE>   For the finale, we choose, almost inevitably, a round-trip on the
Staten Island Ferry. From the rafters of the terminal on the
southernmost tip of Manhattan, cooing pigeons survey the waiting
passengers below. Most are youngsters who, after a night of revel or
work, just missed a ferry back home and doze on the hardwood benches.
A half-hour later, as the next ferry pulls away from the dock with a
foghorn blast, we move to the foredeck to enjoy the bracing air as we
cross over to Staten Island. Even this early on a Sunday, the harbor
is alive with sailboats, passenger cruisers and enormous container
ships. During the 25-minute ride, a 40ish Latina, wrapped in a
bright-colored batik skirt, preaches to her captive audience passages
of Jeremiah from a dogeared, leather-bound Bible. When her sermon
ends, she smiles warmly as a young woman steps forward. A convert, we
wonder (and perhaps the preacher did as well)? But the young woman,
with typical New York chutzpah, only wants to know where the preacher
bought her skirt.</TE>
<TE>   On our return voyage, as the ferry approaches Manhattan, we see
the oxidized blue copper roofs and temple-shaped corporate boardrooms
of older skyscrapers and the sleek, curving smoked glass surfaces of
newer buildings. Joan and I both realize it's the first time during
the entire July evening that we've thought about the missing World
Trade Center towers.</TE>
<TE>   We pass close enough to the Statue of Liberty to see her hooded
eyes and noble nose and the almost sensuous folds of her bronze-green
robe. Nearby rise the spired domes of Ellis Island, gateway to this
country for my grandparents and about 12 million other immigrants
between 1892 and 1954, and now restored as a museum. On the deck
around us are the faces of more recent immigrants: turbaned Sikhs,
bearded Pakistanis with Muslim caps, older Chinese ladies in dark
pajama suits, all on their way to jobs. And we're reminded that not
only is New York the city that never sleeps, it's also the city that
never stops working.</TE>

<HD>BATHING IN SNOW COUNTRY</HD>
<DH>IN THE MOUNTAINS NEAR TOKYO, THE HOT SPRINGS ARE A SUBLIME
MIX OF VISUAL AND PHYSICAL WONDERS</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK EDWARD HARRIS</AU>
<BD>Mark Edward Harris is a Los Angeles-based photographer
and writer whose last piece for the magazine was on conductor Mario
Miragliotta. His Japanese hot springs photographs will be on exhibit
at APEX Fine Art in Los Angeles in March.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's noon on an overcast winter day and i'm on the tokyo station
train platform waiting for the 12:16 p.m. bullet train to the town of
Echigo Yuzawa in Niigata Prefecture. If everything goes according to
plan, in less than two hours I will be up to my ears in hot
water--lolling in one of Japan's thousands of thermal baths.</LD>
<LD>   While all the primeval geologic and geothermal rumblings under
Japan have set off devastating volcanic eruptions, tsunamis and
earthquakes (10% of the world's volcanic activity occurs in Japan),
they also provide the nation's 127 million inhabitants with a sublime
way of life. Two thousand hot springs feed into 10 times that many
baths, providing a soothing connection to a lifestyle born long
before the rapid industrialization of the last century.</LD>
<TE>   I first experienced the pleasures of these springs a decade ago in
Beppu, just days after learning my first lesson about bathing
etiquette. While visiting my girlfriend's parents in Tokyo, I ended
my bath in the family's deep tub by pulling the plug. Our
relationship nearly went down the drain with the soap suds, for I had
committed two cultural faux pas. In Japan, bathing is for relaxation
and cleansing the soul, not the body. Soap is verboten, and water is
always left in the tub until the last bather has soaked. Washing is
done while sitting on a small stool using a hand-held shower head, or
from a bucket dipped into the hot springs.</TE>
<TE>   I've returned to the Japanese spas many times in the decade since
those early experiences, and the magical waters and their
surroundings are still an endless source of visual and visceral
pleasure. Each hot spring and each season bring with them a unique
bathing experience, but it's been in the mountains in mid-winter
where I've felt transported back to a time before Commodore Perry
dropped anchor and helped set in motion the "modernization" of Japan.</TE>
<TE>   On my most recent trip, Echigo Yuzawa is my first stop. It is in
the area of central Japan known as snow country, which encompasses
Gumma Prefecture (a prefecture is a regional district) and extends
into parts of neighboring Niigata and Nagano prefectures. The
location, a two-hour train ride from Tokyo, makes it easily
accessible to travelers.</TE>
<TE>   I learned of Echigo Yuzawa while reading Yasunari Kawabata's Nobel
Prize-winning book, "Yukiguni" ("Snow Country"), set in the 1930s
about the relationship between a geisha at a hot spring and her
city-dwelling client. "After passing through a long border tunnel, it
was snow country," says the book's opening line, conveying the
geographic transition from the dreary, treeless flat plains and towns
outside of Tokyo into these mountains blanketed by white powder in
winter.</TE>
<TE>   The water at Echigo Yuzawa is between 104 and 107 degrees
Fahrenheit--hot, but not too hot. It's perfect for the popular
pastime known as yukimi, or snow gazing while in a meditative state.
An inebriated version known as yukimi-zake adds Japan's most popular
spirit, sake, to the mix. It seems particularly popular with skiers
returning to their hotels from a day on slopes that end a few feet
from the main street.</TE>
<TE>   While many hot springs are restricted to guests staying at a hotel
or inn, some hotels and inns open their springs to the public for day
visits for less than $20. Many towns also have public baths available
for free, or for a fee of a few dollars.</TE>
<TE>   By 2 p.m. I'm reclining in the Yuzawa Toei Hotel's large outdoor
hot spring amid a gentle snowfall. It's a soothing counterpoint to
the 20-degree December day and seems an appropriate occasion for
contemplation, but a sustained "ahh" is the best I can muster. Time
and reality bend, and it's not just from the sake provided by a small
but festive group of apres-skiers.</TE>
<TE>   Later I retreat into the large indoor hot spring pool and enjoy
the view through floor-to-ceiling windows. These baths are the
largest in town, but the mid-1970s modern look of the hotel is not
what I came here for, so I dress and head to the Hakuginkaku
Hananoyoi Ryokan for the night. Its baths are smaller but the hotel
is a hidden oasis of tradition in what has become a fairly modern
town.</TE>
<TE>   When guests arrive at a ryokan (a traditional Japanese inn), they
are to leave their shoes, and their worldly worries, behind. Entering
the foyer, I remove my jacket, gloves and shoes and slip into house
slippers. Then I'm escorted to my room by a hostess in a kimono, her
every movement art in motion. She slides open the door to my room,
removes her sandals and guides me across the tatami floor to an
electric heater covered by a wooden frame that is draped with a
quilt. I sit and put my legs under the quilt to warm them. After
further thawing out with hot tea, I'm guided through guest
registration and the schedules for bathing, dinner and breakfast. I
have time for a quick bath before dinner.</TE>
<TE>   After a great night's sleep on a futon, I have a morning bath and
breakfast, which includes a raw egg mixed with soy sauce and poured
over steamed rice, Japanese pickles and salmon. I bundle up before
making my way on foot through snowdrifts to the Takahan Hotel, which
is perched on a hill. I've come to pay my respects to Kawabata, the
late author of "Yukiguni." His room at the Takahan where he often
wrote has been preserved, along with personal memorabilia.</TE>
<TE>   Next I head by train and bus for Takaragawa, deeper into snow
country, in the mountains of Gumma Prefecture. I arrive after 90
minutes, too early to check in, so I walk to the outdoor bath. It is
Japan's most famous, and is open to day guests as well as overnight
visitors.</TE>
<TE>   It's beyond beautiful here. Surrounded by snow-laden trees, I
cross a plank bridge to the wooden bathhouse at the spring. Steam
rising, the scene has the feel of a Kurosawa film.</TE>
<TE>   The small towel traditionally used by guests at Japanese baths is
too small to cover you front and back, so like most fellow bathers, I
throw caution--and my derriere--to the wind when making the excursion
between bathhouse and hot springs. At springs such as this one, where
the sexes bathe together, some women break from tradition and use
larger bath towels. Even so, the art of discreet peeking is a
favorite past-time of men and women alike, and the dozen or so
dippers I'm with seem adept at the sport. For the shy of heart, hot
springs almost always have a separate bath available for women. At
this one, a statue of Buddha keeps a benevolent eye on the women
bathers.</TE>
<TE>   At Takaragawa, I stay at both the Takaragawa Onsen Bekkan Bunzan
Ryokan and the more casual, affordable and lively Osenkaku Ryokan.
Each has its benefits. At the Osenkaku, the sake and the karaoke
singing provide a nice balance to the serenity of the bathing. At the
Bekkan Bunzan, as at many Japanese inns, the food is exquisitely
presented. My meal includes shrimp served in a tiny half igloo of
ice, beautifully sculpted raw vegetables and a variety of tempura,
sashimi, steamed fish, and meat bathed in a delicate broth.</TE>
<TE>   After dinner, I change into a light cotton robe and an overcoat
provided by the inn and join a small procession of guests for an
evening pilgrimage to the bath. We leave our plastic house slippers
at the doorway and slide into wooden slippers.</TE>
<TE>   While Takaragawa is known as grand champion of outdoor baths, one
of the finest indoor baths in Japan can be found in Gumma Prefecture
at the Choju-kan Ryokan in Hoshi. Carved from chestnut, beech and
Japanese cedar, the bath there soothes bathers with 110-degree spring
water containing calcium and magnesium, which, among other things, is
said to be good for those suffering from hysteria.</TE>
<TE>   The concept of medicinal baths is an important element of hot
springs, with many dedicated to that purpose, including Kusatsu in
Gumma Prefecture, which also has some of the hottest water. Deciding
that I prefer to eat lobster rather than be cooked like one, I watch
from the sidelines as bathers, under the strict supervision of bath
masters, endure immersion in hot spring water that hovers around 125
degrees. The waters are said to be good for circulation and for
curing skin diseases.</TE>
<TE>   While a Kusatsu folk song declares that the hot springs can cure
"anything but love," the curative claims are by no means restricted
to those rooted in science. Japanese bathers believe that radioactive
water can help people suffering from gout and diabetes, and when
imbibed, chronic digestive problems, gallstones and fatigue. Water
heavy in sulfur is thought to remedy metallic poisoning and improve
poor complexions. Acidic water is said to help athlete's foot and
chronic rheumatism.</TE>
<TE>   Before heading back to Tokyo, I have time for one more hot spring,
so I make my way to Jigokudani (Hell's Valley) in Joshin-etsu Plateau
National Park in northeastern Nagano Prefecture. Here humans are not
the only creatures bathing. Snow monkeys (Japanese macaques) are
common winter visitors. Invariably, in the early morning a few brave
monkeys invade the "people" bath at the Korakukan Ryokan before
heading to their own hot spring deeper in the valley. At the end of a
day of bathing, the monkeys head back into the hills, while ryokan
guests head to the dining room. Sitting on cushions at Korakukan
Ryokan, I'm served an almost endless feast of udon noodles, river
fish, mountain vegetables and chimaki--a sticky, sweet rice.</TE>
<TE>   After the most restful of sleeps in the simple ryokan room, the
next morning comes too soon. It's time to head back to the 21st
century. I hope the transition will be as gentle as the baths of snow
country.</TE>

<LD>With the New York City skyline bereft of the World Trade Center
towers, Americans have a renewed appreciation for the distinctive
structures that symbolize the spirit of a city. Princeton
Architectural Press taps into that sentiment with two richly designed
photography books.</LD>
<LD>   "The Chrysler Building: Creating a New York Icon, Day by Day," by
David Stravitz ($45), due out this fall, presents more than 100
long-lost photographs documenting the 1928-1930 construction of the
Art Deco skyscraper, briefly the world's tallest building at 1,046
feet until the Empire State Building captured the honor in 1931.
Stravitz, a photography aficionado, discovered a cache of historic
negatives in a defunct photo studio days before they were to be
recycled for their silver content. The dramatic images presented here
showcase the optimism of the Chrysler's machine age architecture
against the backdrop of Depression-era Manhattan, from the
marble-clad lobby to the exterior's ornamental eagles and gargoyles
resembling car parts.</LD>
<TE>   "The Eiffel Tower" ($19.95), expected early next year, is a
tribute to the most famous of Parisian landmarks. The haunting photos
in the book span 50 years in the career of Lucien Herve, one of
Europe's most renowned architectural photographers. The once
controversial tower was built for the International Exposition of
Paris in 1889 to symbolize the science and engineering achievements
of the time. (At 984 feet, it, too, reigned as the world's tallest
structure until the Chrysler Building was built.) Members of the
city's artistic elite found it an eyesore at the time, but the
ethereal iron tower became an icon of the City of Light.</TE>

<LD>In her day, the elegant Queen Elizabeth 2, renowned for her regal
bearing and the amount of caviar consumed on board, has ferried
everyone from the Queen of England to the Sultan of Brunei to
Elizabeth Taylor. But soon the colonies will be seeing much less of
the grande dame: The legendary liner is retiring from transatlantic
sailing after 33 years of crossing the Pond between New York and
Southampton, England. Beginning in 2004, the route will belong to the
Queen Mary 2, the newest member of the Cunard line.</LD>
<LD>   The 150,000-ton QM2, pictured here in an artist's rendering, is
touted as the "largest, longest, widest, tallest and most expensive
passenger vessel ever constructed." The massive ship will carry 2,620
passengers in 1,310 staterooms and suites (most with private
balconies); 10 dining venues, including one operated by celebrity
chef Todd English; a 20,000-square-foot Canyon Ranch spa; 14 bars;
five pools; a planetarium; British nannies for the kids; and a pet
kennel.</LD>
<LD>   The QM2's 14-day maiden voyage from England to Fort Lauderdale,
Fla., in January 2004 is nearly sold out. Transatlantic crossings
begin in England on April 16 of that year. The QE2 will end her
once-a-year world cruise in New York in time for her last eastbound
Atlantic journey, leading the way to London on a tandem crossing with
her younger sibling.</LD>
<TE>   Traditionalists still have time to book one of the QE2's final
transatlantic cruises during her farewell season, April through
December 2003. Thereafter, the cruise world's queen mum, which still
holds the title of fastest passenger liner on the high seas, will
sally forth on other England-based cruises.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Six-day transatlantic crossings on the QE2 and QM2 start at $1,499
per person, double occupancy, including one-way air transportation,

<LD>Railroad enthusiasts have been collecting discontinued dining car
china for years, often paying steep prices for historic dishware.
There's plenty to choose from: In the glory days of train travel, in
the late 19th and early 20th centuries, most companies (and even
individual routes or trains) had dining ware patterns, and the rugged
pieces have held up well over time.</LD>
<LD>   These days there are more reasonably priced alternatives, thanks
to reissues of classic railroad china. The California State Railroad
Museum Foundation in Sacramento recently introduced a replica line of
the Santa Fe Railway's California Poppy china. The pattern, based on
the California state flower, debuted in 1892 for Santa Fe's premier
"California Limited" train and remained in service until Amtrak took
over in 1971. It didn't take market research to settle on the
product. "We have a permanent exhibit called 'Dinner in the Diner,'
'' says Paul Hammond, director of marketing and development. "It's a
Super Chief dining car, and each table is set with different styles
of china. Most people point out the California Poppy pattern and ask
where they can get it."</LD>
<TE>   The museum hired Rich Luckin, an expert on dining car china, to
help authenticate and oversee the reproduction. The microwave and
dishwasher-safe ware, manufactured by Buffalo China, is a hit,
Hammond says; the first lot sold out three weeks after its debut last
year. A place setting (dinner plate, side plate, fruit dish, cup and
saucer) retails for $99.50. Larger settings are available, with
additional pieces due late this fall.</TE>
<TE>   The museum store also carries replicas of the Santa Fe Railway's
original Mimbreno china from Pipestone. The stylized Southwestern
pattern based on ancient Mimbres Indian pottery motifs was introduced
in 1937 aboard the luxury Super Chief.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Poppy and Mimbreno china are available at the California State
Railroad Museum store, 111 I St., Sacramento; (800) 417-7245,

<LD>Part of the price of being a tourist is often hauling around bulky
guidebooks and trying to decipher unwieldy street maps. Now the
innovative InsideOut City Guides give travelers a sense of direction
without the hassle. The elegantly designed guides have everything
needed to find one's way, all between two sleek silver covers: Popout
maps that open and close in a single motion; a colorful 64-page
guidebook with six easy-to-navigate sections: See it (what to see),
Watch it (what to do), Taste it (where to eat), Buy it (where to
shop), Know it (everything else) and Speak it (how to pronounce the
local lingo); a directory of hotel listings; a built-in compass to
check your bearings; and a mini-pen for taking notes. Listings are
cross-referenced on the maps, making it easy to stay on course.</LD>
<LD>   Guides are available for London, New York, Paris, Amsterdam, Rome,
Florence, Venice (pictured here), Madrid, Barcelona, Prague, Los
Angeles and San Francisco. Guides for Boston and Berlin are due out
this month; Las Vegas, Orlando, Dublin and Majorca debut in November.</LD>

<LD>BMW's reissue of the classic MINI Cooper automobile is cool, but one
drawback lurks for retro-but-now drivers who want to hit the road:
There's not much room for luggage. Now Samsonite has designed a
three-piece collection of MINI Travel Gear engineered to fit
perfectly into the car's diminutive cargo hold. Equally important for
the style-conscious, whether MINI owners or not, each bag reflects
the car's distinctive look, with reflective piping, chrome-hubbed
wheels and an orange button on the handle modeled after the MINI's
turn signal.</LD>

<LD>In the pack-well-and-get-the-job-done coterie known as frequent
fliers, a hot fashion trend is wearing your ID around your neck. The
look might be charitably described as geek chic, but the arms-free
accessory is undeniably practical now that passengers must show
identification countless times before boarding. Most travel stores
carry some version of a neck pouch, but one of the best is En Route
Travelware's Photo ID/Ticket Holder. The see-through pouch keeps ID
and passport visible, zipping closed so that important documents
won't fall out. A separate pocket holds tickets for easy access.
Unlike some document holders, this one is backed with soft fabric
that won't chafe if you also want to wear it under clothing as a
security pouch. It also folds easily for stashing in a purse or
pocket.</LD>

<LD>In the centuries-old European spa tradition, patients traditionally
"take the kur," often doctor-recommended mineral water treatments. On
this side of the Atlantic, destination spas morphed into fat farms or
retreats rather than healing centers--but lately some stateside spas
are returning to their roots, offering cholesterol tests and body
scans along with the hot rock massages and mud baths. Spa stays
aren't chargeable to insurance, but some plans may cover medically
necessary procedures, so pampering yourself could also get you less
time in the doctor's waiting room.</LD>

<LD>I stayed at a friend's apartment on East 57th at 2nd , right in the
heart of New York. I walked to Little Italy, Chinatown and back. I
stayed away from every upscale restaurant you can think of. I'm tired
of them. But I did go to Douglas Rodriguez's new restaurant, Chicama.
He started Nuevo Latino cuisine in New York. I went to my favorite
bar, Bull and Bear in the Waldorf=Astoria. I also saw three plays:
"The Boys from Syracuse," "The Producers," "Oklahoma." I grew up in
New York. So it's kind of coming home.</LD>
<LD>   Discovery: There's this restaurant on 73rd at Madison Avenue
called Via Quadronno. It's narrow and long. I had the best cafe latte
there.</LD>

<LD>I went to Japan for the first time. I went with my brother Piet and
Billy Shire, who owns the Wacko store in L.A. I wanted to see the two
sides of Japan that interest me. The frenetic pop culture side [is]
what we did in Tokyo. Shibuya is where all the kids go to be hip and
hang out. It's like Melrose Avenue but kicked up. I loved it. We went
to Kyoto. That was the other side of Japanese culture, the ancient
imperial state of Japan. Our host was a Japanese pop star. He
arranged a traditional geisha dinner for us. We had 15 courses with
breaks where they sang and danced. That was one of the most memorable
experiences [of] my life.</LD>
<LD>   Discovery: I wanted to buy a bunch of that plastic food. I've seen
it in restaurants here. The restaurant supply district in Tokyo is
called Kappabashi [Kitchen Town]. A few stores there, that's all they
specialize in.</LD>

<LD>In June I went to Zihuatanejo, Mexico, mainly just to relax. It's one
of those great places where there's not an awful lot to do. The
biggest decision of the day is where you're going to have dinner. And
for a small Mexican fishing village, the food is great. There are
three or four extraordinary restaurants. We stayed at a beautiful
hotel called Villa del Sol. Our room was 50 yards from the beach.
Most of every day we spent on that golden sand beach, reading. They
also served meals on the beach, which is truly decadent. I went
parasailing for the first time. I found it one of the most peaceful
and relaxing things I've ever done, like floating on air.</LD>
<LD>   Discovery: There is a very different, large resort nearby called
La Casa Que Canta. It's built into a cliff. They have a beautiful
cocktail lounge that overlooks the bay. It's a great place to watch
the sunset.</LD>

<LD>I went to Paris about six months ago and stayed at the Four Seasons
Hotel George V. It's five minutes from Avenue Montaigne, where all
the great stores are--Fendi, Gucci, Prada--near the Arc de Triomphe
and next to the Champs-Elysees. The rooms are huge--the bathrooms are
really what I remember most. In terms of dinner, my favorite is
L'Avenue on Avenue Montaigne [where she's pictured seated third from
left]. The crab cakes are great. People in Paris dress so amazing,
you have a great time looking at the people. A place to have drinks
is the Plaza Athenee, an old hotel but the youngest, hippest crowd
you can imagine.</LD>
<LD>   Discovery: One of my favorite stores is called Colette. It's one
of those lifestyle stores. You'll have everything from computers to
Gucci and Prada clothes to sneakers to CDs and books. Downstairs is a
restaurant with nice healthy food.</LD>

<HD>SAILING TONGA'S FANTASY ISLANDS</HD>
<DH>THE LUSH POLYNESIAN ISLANDS OF VAVA'U, MANY UNINHABITED,
ARE BEST SEEN FROM THE DECK OF A YACHT</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA JONES</AU>
<BD>Amanda Jones, who lives in New Zealand, last wrote for
the magazine about Samoa.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It would seem just my luck, of course, that I would end up in the
most unexpectedly romantic place not with the love of my life but
with my perfectly nice sister-in-law. We are great friends, Sally and
I, but, hey, when you're on a 46-foot yacht in paradise, who could
blame me for wanting more?</LD>
<LD>   We were in Tonga on a gamble. A Samoan chief once told me that
heaven could be found in Vava'u, the northernmost group of islands in
Tonga. He had not been there himself, he said, but among South
Pacific islanders, Vava'u is legendary for its loveliness. I'd also
heard yachties say that Vava'u has some of the best cruising on the
planet. Beyond this, we knew little.</LD>
<LD>   On a map, Tonga is smack in the middle of the South Pacific, lying
northeast of New Zealand and south of Fiji and Samoa. The Kingdom, as
it's called by its proudly royalist inhabitants, is composed of 140
islands divided into four chains. They are known as the Friendly
Islands.</LD>
<TE>   If Tonga were more accessible, this kind of extreme tropical
beauty would doubtless have been developed into a parade of Club
Meds. But Vava'u, with its 16,000 easygoing people, has a purity
rarely found elsewhere. Smooth ivory beaches surround fertile
volcanic islands. Brilliant aquamarine waters, unpolluted and calm as
millponds, lap the mostly uninhabited islands. Coral reefs teem with
underwater life and trees hang heavy with exotic fruits.</TE>
<TE>   But Vava'u is not a tourist destination; it is a traveler's
destination. If you desire spas and cell phones, go somewhere else.
If you are looking to be far, far from the madding crowd--bingo,
welcome to Valhalla.</TE>
<TE>   Even crabby Paul Theroux liked Vava'u. His ornery book "The Happy
Isles of Oceania" attempted to disprove the perception of the South
Pacific as nirvana. Nonetheless, in his chapter on paddling the
islands he graciously conceded, "Everything about the Vava'u group
pleased me."</TE>
<TE>   Like Theroux, however, Sally and I at first regretted our choice
of Tonga after spending a night in Nuku'alofa, the capital on the
main island of Tongatapu. It seemed overpopulated, badly littered and
filled with run-down, unappealing cinder-block architecture. But as
the plane to Vava'u--Royal Tongan Airlines is the only carrier inside
Tonga--skimmed over islands ringed with every conceivable blue, we
were filled with fresh hope that maybe, just maybe, untrammeled
Shangri-Las were still out there.</TE>
<TE>   We'd arranged for our boat through Sunsail, a yacht chartering
company that leases boats in 42 ports of paradise around the world.
Moorings, another large international chartering company, also has a
base on Vava'u. The joy of going through companies like these is that
no matter how undeveloped the region, you're guaranteed a good
quality boat.</TE>
<TE>   At the shed-like airport in Neiafu, Vava'u's capital, we were met
by Mark Managh, Sunsail's Tonga-based manager. A New Zealander, Mark
has lived in Tonga for five years but has avoided "going troppo," the
term for people who drop out, move to the islands and never wear
shoes or look in a mirror again. Mark cut quite a dashing figure: hip
sideburns, George Clooney haircut, and that charisma exhibited by
those who spend 80% of their time outdoors.</TE>
<TE>   Our boat, named Options, was a Beneteau Oceanis 461 yacht owned by
an American couple who had made a killing in the go-go stock market
and then gone troppo in their own small way--occasionally vacationing
on their boat when they weren't leasing it through Sunsail. It was a
slick 46-footer with three double cabins, ensuite bathrooms, a large
saloon, tidy galley, spacious cockpit, teak cockpit deck and gleaming
fiberglass hull. There should have been four of us, but at the last
moment two were called back to work obligations, leaving Sally and me
to press onward.</TE>
<TE>   Given that we are nautical layabouts, a skipper was required.
Although Sunsail mainly offers bareboat charters, they happened to
have Limoni "Ray" Siasau on hand for cases like ours.</TE>
<TE>   Ray, 29, had close-cropped hair, bulging muscles and a radiant
white smile. He seemed reserved at our first meeting, likely appalled
at being asked to shepherd two lone women around for a week. Tongan
society is fervently Christian and conservative. Taboos between men
and women mean that brothers and sisters cannot sleep in the same
house or even ride in the same car. Although Ray was married with
five children, he may have been concerned about his congregation's
view of him spending time in the blue beyond with two bikini-clad
palangi (foreigners).</TE>
<TE>   We'd arrived in the "off-season," which means the hurricane
season. Tonga's temperature varies little year-round, but we had read
that short bursts of rainfall and occasional storms occur December
through March. Two weeks before, one of those storms had rolled
through in the shape of Vava'u's worst hurricane in 40 years.
Although no one was hurt, the devastation on Vava'u was shocking.
Winds of up to 180 mph had flogged the islands from opposing
directions, hurling rain and seawater onto the land, denuding trees
and mangling palms. Houses had blue tarps for roofs and boats listed
with gaping gashes. But Tongans are a remarkably relaxed lot.</TE>
<TE>   One man told me he had slept through it--until his roof blew off.
Another woman, looking embarrassed, apologized because Vava'u was
"very ugly now." But she was wrong. Although the damage was stark, it
was not enough to bury the shining beauty of the place. It must have
been painfully pretty before.</TE>
<TE>   We cast off before sunset, motoring for Port Mourelle. An hour
later, a vast arc of untracked sand came into view. The water was
vivid turquoise, so clear that we could see the fat orange and blue
starfish on the flickering ocean floor. We dropped anchor while the
sun paved a golden path between boat and shore, blazing up the bushy
flanks of the island. Sally and I dove into the warm water, floating
on our backs, grinning like fools.</TE>
<TE>   The boat was provisioned with basics such as meat, vegetables,
fish, eggs and salad makings, and we had supplemented that with
necessities including feta cheese on brie, peanut butter, vodka and
wine purchased in Nuku'alofa. We poured cocktails, whipped up dinner,
and ate in the cockpit with the breeze licking our bare shoulders.
The air was so tepid, clothing was purely for vanity, or for Ray's
sake.</TE>
<TE>   The next day dawned cobalt, the flat water mirroring the sky and
island. After breakfast, we set sail for Eueiki. The beauty about
sailing in Vava'u is that usually there are no rough seas, no
blustery slogs to get to the next location, no wretched
seasickness--just short, languid hops between islands.</TE>
<TE>   Traveling at 8 knots, it took an hour to get to Eueiki, a tiny
atoll famous for being the location of a New Zealand television show
called "Treasure Island." The program is similar to America's
stratospherically successful "Survivor," only the New Zealanders
didn't pretend to scour the nation for average Joes who happen to
look like models and jocks. Instead they hired models and jocks to do
the job, marooning them on this minuscule island for weeks of
deprivation and wrenching interpersonal dynamics.</TE>
<TE>   We gazed at the island, imagining the luminaries stranded on this
speck of sand without makeup kit or weight machine and limited food
supplies. Sally recounted having watched the finale when the stars
were asked their innermost thoughts. The interview went loosely like
this:</TE>
<TE>   Host (to emaciated model): "Your team wasn't terribly successful
at finding food. So what's your first meal gonna be at home?"</TE>
<TE>   Emaciated model: "I'm fantasizing about piles of arugula. I'd
totally kill for a salad."</TE>
<TE>   We reflected on how despicable it was to starve for two weeks and
then go on national television flaunting a wanton craving for a
lettuce leaf.</TE>
<TE>   We swam in the jade waters of Eueiki, then hunted down a fishing
canoe we'd seen offshore. Ray seemed miffed that we would seek to buy
fish: "I can catch them, too, you know."</TE>
<TE>   Ray was beginning to loosen up. We learned that he was a native of
Vava'u, had married young and went to his Presbyterian church three
times a week. He had never considered becoming a skipper until
Sunsail taught him the fine art of sailing and navigating Vava'u's
numerous reefs. Ray had left the islands only once to go to New
Zealand. It wasn't the airplane ride that worried him; it was the
cars on the motorway there. People went way too fast, he said.</TE>
<TE>   While with us, Ray was constantly on the move. By day three he
asked permission to remove his T-shirt. We granted permission, amazed
by his decorum. His shirt was not seen again.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Ray's objection, we purchased a sizable tuna from the
local fishermen and set sail for Nuku Island, another strip of
perfection with nothing on it but some children playing in the water.
It is close to Falevai, which has several villages and is the largest
of the Vava'u islands. People there seemed busy. In the village we
visited, women took turns doing laundry in an outdoor
generator-operated washing machine, men repaired boats, teenage boys
played volleyball, and young girls harvested coconuts for dinner.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, promptly at 8, a speedboat bore down on us from
the distance. It was a Beluga Diving boat, ordered for a scuba-diving
excursion. We'd radioed our position and here was Huib Kuilboert, a
Dutch transplant, with Tongan dive guide Ali Takau. Despite hurricane
damage, Vava'u was the best diving I've done in a long time.
Brilliant fish slipped in synchronized schools between hoary sponges,
corals exploded like steroidal toadstools, gorgonians waved
trance-like in the crystal waters, sharks swam smugly beneath coral
shelves. I was convinced: Tonga is as pretty below as it is above.</TE>
<TE>   We'd heard stories of ex-pats running small resorts on isolated
islands before we went ashore for dinner at the Mounu Island Resort.
As our dinghy grazed the beach, a sinewy man with a patchy shaven
head and chest-length beard appeared with a raised hand. He looked
not unlike Tom Hanks in the latter part of the movie "Castaway," with
the exception of the hair. He was New Zealander Allan Bowe, who runs
the resort with his wife, Lyn.</TE>
<TE>   Mounu Island is tiny and lush with three simple but elegant guest
fales (cottages) and a beachside restaurant with candlelit dining. It
is real end-of-the-earth stuff. Migrating humpback whales come within
yards of the shore between July and November. Bowe said he takes
guests out to swim with the colossal creatures, which ignore the
swimmers as a rhino ignores a gnat.</TE>
<TE>   Over a hearty meal of coq au vin, Bowe regaled us with amusing
stories of life in Tonga, which is one of the world's last contented
monarchies. The royal family was Bowe's favorite topic. The king,
renowned for his girth (pre-diet he weighed 462 pounds), is a quirky
leader, but his 100,000 citizens revere him and accept nepotism and
elitism as essential elements of kingly pomp.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently his highness had visited recently and the resort had
catered the picnic. Bowe recounted the tale with great gusto:</TE>
<TE>   "He came ashore wearing a Mexican sombrero, humungous Hawaiian
shirt, Tongan tupenu skirt, flax cummerbund, pink knee-high socks and
furry Ugg boots." (Note that the temperature in Tonga never dips
below 70 degrees.)</TE>
<TE>   Bowe went on to say that the post-diet royal highness, now
weighing 270 pounds, swims regularly for exercise. "We stood about
watching as he swam laps in the ocean with two 'talking chiefs'
trying to keep up. The king can't talk to commoners directly, so they
had to swim alongside just in case his highness wanted to have a chat
with someone. Two bodyguards swam beside the 'talking chiefs,' and a
speedboat of soldiers circled the lot. All this for a picnic of about
12 people."</TE>
<TE>   The following day we swam, snorkeled and hoisted sail for Blue
Lagoon Resort on Foe'ata. The island has creamy, unblemished sand,
but when we went ashore the resort's owner inexplicably asked us to
leave. This infuriated Ray, but we retreated, thankful that our
splendid yacht could carry us off to any island we liked.</TE>
<TE>   Each of us has a single meal that lingers in our minds, and the
lunch we cooked that day is mine. In order to banish his Blue Lagoon
funk, we sent Ray off with his hand line. He soon returned holding
aloft five snapper. On lonesome and immaculate Euakafa island, we dug
a pit in the sand, collected driftwood, lighted a fire and threw the
fish on a grill, dousing them with coconut milk and lime. We tossed
on some bananas, boiled coconut rice, added avocado and cilantro,
cracked a bottle of New Zealand's finest Sauvignon Blanc and feasted.</TE>
<TE>   We had several other memorable meals in Tonga, including a
traditional village feast where suckling pig was roasted on a spit
and root vegetables were cooked in an umu pit oven and served with
papaya, lobster and raw marinated fish. But the most extraordinary
restaurant is La Paella on Tapana Island.</TE>
<TE>   Owners Maria and Eduardo Mesias are Spaniards from Valencia. She
is an elegant flamenco dancer; he a salty, introverted guitarist with
long hair and a wild beard. They sailed to Tonga 10 years ago, were
enamored with the place and stayed and opened a restaurant that
serves tapas and paella to passing sailors. Accessible only by boat,
it has become the most acclaimed dining establishment in Tonga.</TE>
<TE>   It is built high on a cliff overlooking Tapana harbor, cobbled
together from an aesthetically haphazard mix of bamboo, driftwood,
wooden beams and random Spanish items such as bullfighting posters
and mantillas. After serving us lobster ceviche, bechamel croquettes,
frittata and seafood paella, Eduardo and Maria flung aside a
makeshift curtain and launched into the music of Spain, Cuba, Brazil
and Mexico, with Eduardo playing an ancient guitar.</TE>
<TE>   On our final morning we sailed to Maninita, at the southern end of
Vava'u. Encircled by a treacherous reef, Maninita doesn't draw many
boaters and the island is thick with bird life. Amid the cacophony of
fairy terns, swallows, egrets, herons and noddies, we picked our way
around the lava shore.</TE>
<TE>   We sailed back to Neiafu slowly that afternoon, not yet ready to
leave the rocking boat and the spangled night skies. We did what all
travelers do when they are sad to leave a place--we made earnest
promises to return soon, to come back and swim with the whales, walk
other islands we didn't reach, explore the caves we never entered,
and dive the reefs we didn't see.</TE>
<TE>   This is a promise I intend to keep. Only next time, I'll be there
with the love of my life.</TE>

<DL>Barcelona, Spain</DL>
<LD>Some people refer to Barcelona, the stylish city on Spain's
northeastern Mediterranean coast, as the poor man's Paris. Two people
can share an elegant dinner with wine for $60, and you can still find
a good hotel room for $100 a night.</LD>
<LD>   Best of all, they say, Barcelona has sophistication without
attitude.</LD>
<LD>   I had the perfect excuse to find out for myself last spring. My
son Joe, 21, was finishing his junior semester at the University of
Barcelona. I was hoping he had been gone long enough to miss me and
to develop an appetite for sharing a few good meals with his mom.</LD>
<TE>   A modernist city, Barcelona has been reinventing itself since
Roman times. It is the capital of Catalonia, a fiercely independent
region of Spain with its own language, flag and history of political
upheaval. (It was the center of the left-wing opposition during the
Spanish Civil War.) Barcelona's popularity as a tourist destination
has grown since the 1992 Olympics. This year, many architecture buffs
arrived for the 150th anniversary of the birth of visionary architect
Antonio Gaudi, whose distinctive, free-form works are known
worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Barcelona is filled with world-class architecture and, some would
say, world-class cuisine. The region's cooking uses many of the same
ingredients as that of other Mediterranean countries -- fresh
seafood; salt cod and anchovies; olive oil; garlic; eggplant,
spinach, tomatoes and peppers; olives; wild game and duck -- and
turns them into dishes of great variety, refinement and
soul-satisfying flavor.</TE>
<TE>   In Spanish style, the two big meals of the day are lunch, eaten
between 2 and 4 p.m., and dinner, which rarely starts before 9 p.m.
and which lasts a minimum of three hours. As an American worker bee
who has been gulping down 20-minute lunches at her desk for the last
few years, I have great respect for the Spanish, who refuse to rush
the really important things in life, like meals. Shops still close,
people drink wine with lunch, and friends linger over coffee and
cigarettes until the last piece of gossip has been shared and
savored.</TE>
<TE>   It felt wonderful never to rush a meal, and reassuring to know
that there was always a tapas bar open for savory snacks and prime
people-watching along the lovely Passeig de Gracia, a short walk from
my hotel, the Inglaterra.</TE>
<TE>   Restaurants are buzzing and reservations are recommended,
especially on weekends. Service at all the restaurants I visited was
warm and gracious, despite my nonexistent Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   The proud Catalan character does not encourage big tipping. One
taxi driver actually returned a tip he felt was too extravagant. A 5%
tip is considered sufficient in this socialist stronghold.</TE>
<TE>   The restaurants below, listed in no particular order, were the top
picks of an acquaintance who lives in Barcelona and who gives food
tours of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Cal Pep: Worth a long wait</TE>
<TE>   If you're in Barcelona for only a few days, this is a place you
don't want to miss. Cal Pep is the prototypical, unpretentious
seafood joint. It's close to the Picasso museum and the port in the
hip section of town called the Born and is basically a long, narrow
sliver of a room where guests dine at a marble bar without the
intrusion of menus, reservations or waiters.</TE>
<TE>   We arrived about 8:30 on a weeknight and encountered a 30-minute
wait. It was worth it. We started with a pile of the tiniest
sardines, lightly battered and crisply fried, which we tossed into
our mouths like shoestring fries. We shared quartered baby
artichokes, also battered and fried, and a delicious bowl of warm
garbanzo beans seasoned with succulent bits of salt pork and wilted
spinach.</TE>
<TE>   In no particular order, we also ate small clams steamed in a white
wine, garlic and parsley broth, fresh sole grilled on the bone and
served simply with lemon, and the first of many steaks that Joe was
to order in the two weeks we ate together. (You can take the college
boy out of America, but you can't take America out of the college
boy.) We drank a white Penedes and pointed to the dessert that other
diners were delicately licking off their espresso spoons: three shot
glasses filled with light, foamy custards of coffee, lemon and
cinnamon.</TE>
<TE>   Pep Manubens Figueres, the chef and owner, is obviously a local
celebrity -- I noticed his cookbook in Barcelona bookstores -- and he
deserves it.</TE>
<TE>   Chicoa: Off the tourist route</TE>
<TE>   Everything about this place was warm, welcoming and about as far
as you can get from the tourist part of town, where those less
fortunate than us were dining on cheap paella. With its white stucco
walls, wood beams and antique cookware, Chicoa offered Joe and me our
most traditional meal.</TE>
<TE>   We started with plump green asparagus spears charred and served
with romesco, a sauce of mashed almonds, bread and tomatoes, and a
dish of calcots, young spring onions battered and fried. I ordered
snails; Joe gamely dug the little bits of gray meat out of their
shells with his long wooden spear and dipped them into a garlicky
allioli, or garlic mayonnaise, before popping them into his mouth and
shouting, "All right, I did it."</TE>
<TE>   For a main course, I ordered what turned out to be one of my
favorite dishes on the trip, a simple fideus rubios, or toasted
vermicelli enriched with a flavorful fish broth, tomatoes and garlic
and topped with a few clams. It was brought to the table in the
skillet and was perfect with some of that soul-stirring allioli
spooned on top. Joe had a huge dish of fried hake and calamari that
looked a little heavy to his middle-age mom but the accompaniment of
fried whole green peppers called pimentos padron was just right for
cutting the richness. (These small, mildly spicy peppers are often
served with grilled meats and poultry and were a welcome sight to
chile-starved Californians. We were surprised that the Spanish rely
more on salt than pepper for seasoning.)</TE>
<TE>   Dessert was hardly necessary, but Joe managed to demolish a large
slice of caramelized apple tart with crema catalana, a vanilla
custard. I watched in wonder while sipping an espresso and thinking
about my hotel bed.</TE>
<TE>   Hofmann: French with a twist</TE>
<TE>   This elegant boite, up a narrow staircase in the grungy Gothic
Barrio, is for the gourmet with deep pockets who likes a little show
with his fine dining. Hofmann is a cooking school that serves lunch
and dinner five days a week. It was a beehive of activity the night
we met friends there for a late dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Our party of six sat in a private glass-walled room with views of
the marble-topped pastry station, where chefs were spinning sugar
cages while students scurried around lugging stockpots and mopping up
spills. At the center was chef/entrepreneur Mey Hofmann -- a Latin
Martha Stewart in skintight hot pink Versace and black stilettos who
holds diplomas from Cordon Bleu and LeNotre in Paris. She weds haute
French technique to Spanish ingredients with style and precision in
her cooking classes and local TV show.</TE>
<TE>   Joe and his friends were duly impressed. Although I tend to feel
cheated by small, precisely cut morsels of food huddled on oversized
white plates, there were a few knockout appetizers that night. Among
them were a warm sardine tart with a bottom layer of egg tortilla, or
omelet; a plate of baby squashes, eggplant and tomato stuffed with
tapenades; and a silky red gazpacho garnished with poached cod. I
recommend skipping the entrees and going straight to desserts if you
have the chutzpah. One friend's steak had to be sent back to the
kitchen twice because the chef refused to cook it medium-well, and my
two baby lamb chops lacked flavor.</TE>
<TE>   The desserts, however, brought us back under Hofmann's spell, with
a dish of creme brulee causing communal sighs as we passed it around
the table. Each bite-sized morsel was a 1-inch round of crisp burnt
sugar topped with gooseberry jam. All the desserts tasted as
beautiful as they looked, and we left feeling pampered, if not too
full.</TE>
<TE>   Txokoa: Value in abundance</TE>
<TE>   Located in the residential neighborhood of Gracia, just above the
Diagonal, one of Barcelona's main drags, this Basque restaurant is
the type of place I'm always searching for when traveling -- small,
family-owned, with great food.</TE>
<TE>   Once you walk past the bar and go downstairs into the cozy dining
room, all is wood, cane chairs, small oil paintings and gracious
warmth. The three-course menu is fixed-price, with plenty of dishes
to choose from. With house wine, a Rioja, the meal came to $25 a
person.</TE>
<TE>   The Basque region, on Spain's North Atlantic coast, is known for
its produce, seafood and meat. And a great deal of soul. We started
with a platter of refined pintxos, Basque tapas, which included foie
gras on toast with plum compote, a large pillow of spinach-stuffed
ravioli in bacon vinaigrette, and sweet roasted piquillo peppers
stuffed with bacalao -- salt cod -- and drizzled with pil-pil, a
light green emulsion of parsley, garlic and olive oil. I had an
elegant entree of seared duck breast fanned over apple puree with a
thin syrup of balsamic vinegar and pan juices.</TE>
<TE>   Joe read the disclaimers on the menu about European beef and went
for it anyway. He ordered a hearty  1/2-inch-thick, 1-pound serving
of local beef on the bone, outlined with an inch of well-charred fat.
The steak was grilled and served simply with a green salad and warm
piquillo peppers, and he thoroughly enjoyed it.</TE>
<TE>   After his dessert of chocolate terrine topped with chocolate ice
cream, he vowed to return with his friends for their farewell dinner
in Barcelona. I can see why. Txokoa is a real deal, and there's not
an ounce of pretension in its warm wooden bones.</TE>
<TE>   Agua: It's all about the scenery</TE>
<TE>   I was intrigued when our taxi driver dropped us off at an elevator
alongside the sea in the old section of town called Barceloneta. From
the street we could see Frank Gehry's big copper-colored fish from
the '92 Olympics glistening in the sunshine, and when we stepped out
of the elevator downstairs, we entered a big, airy modern dining room
that could have been in California.</TE>
<TE>   Our outdoor table was prime real estate, a patio practically on
the beach, with a perfect view of the promenade, including topless
bathers for the boys. When I eyed hamburgers, pasta and salads on the
menu, however, my heart sank. I hate to waste a meal in Europe on
food I could be eating anywhere. With the help of another good bottle
of white wine, I recovered.</TE>
<TE>   Once I accepted that Agua is all about being where the beautiful
people are on a sunlit Sunday afternoon in Spain, I found it very
relaxing. I practically slipped into a coma fantasizing about all the
cool-looking people casually puffing away on their cigarettes as I
noodled around with my food for three hours. My only regret is that I
didn't order the rice al carbon. In retrospect, all the locals were
nibbling this luscious-looking rice dish brought to the table in
earthenware casseroles, not the weird stacked salads and lobster
risottos we mistakenly ordered. As I said, it may not have been about
the food, but the scenery was fantastic. Don't go at night.</TE>
<TE>   L'Olive: Simple, soothing retreat</TE>
<TE>   In L'Olive, a short walk from Plaza Catalunya but a world away
from the tawdry Ramblas, I found my comfort spot. With its calm,
minimalist decor and polished, unobtrusive service, L'Olive was a
welcome retreat after a day of architectural excess or hard-core
shopping. We ate there on several nights, so we got to sample lots of
dishes on the large menu of updated Catalan cuisine.</TE>
<TE>   Dinner starts with three types of bread: crusty rolls, toasted
baguette for the house tapenade and pan con tomate, the Catalan
specialty of grilled country bread drizzled with olive oil and rubbed
with cut tomato.</TE>
<TE>   My favorite dishes at L'Olive tended to be the simpler ones. We
had an outstanding dish of fava beans in a rich brown broth studded
with salt pork; tiny cockles on the half shell baked on a bed of salt
and seasoned with bread crumbs, garlic and tomato; spinach with
raisins and pine nuts; a good escalivada of grilled eggplant and red
pepper strips bathed in olive oil; and a wonderful eggplant appetizer
stuffed with a rich mixture of ground pork, cheese and tomatoes. I
had a terrific plate of grilled squid one night, arranged in a spoke
pattern and oozing butter; I also liked the restaurant's signature
carpaccio, translucent slices of pink bacalao cured with bitter
orange and sprinkled with dill.</TE>
<TE>   Less impressive were the famous Spanish stews and rice dishes that
rely on long, slow cooking. Joe's paella lacked soul, and my angler
suquet, a traditional stew of fish and potatoes, was too plain for my
taste. On the other hand, one evening when a friend's parents joined
us, the father was relieved that he could order a simple dish of
grilled salmon seasoned with coarse salt and lemon and garnished with
vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   L'Olive features a long list of delicious ice creams for dessert,
from the sublime (hazelnut and plum) to the unusual (fresh cheese
with bitter orange). Our college boys were happy to help us polish
off the luscious ice cream-stuffed cream puffs. May their arteries
stay forever young.</TE>

<HD>Barcelona for the senses</HD>
<DH>In this sophisticated Spanish city, three celebrated
palaces of music are a feast for the eyes as well as for the ears.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stanley Meisler</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>Barcelona, Spain</DL>
<LD>Painters such as Pablo Picasso and Joan Miro and architects such as
Antonio Gaudi have given this city a reputation as a center of
European art. Less known is its role as a musical metropolis. But
Barcelona, the capital of the Spanish region of Catalonia, has
produced as many virtuoso musicians as artists, and its three houses
of music -- the Liceo, the Palau de la Musica Catalana and L'Auditori
-- are a delight to patronize, or merely to behold.</LD>
<LD>   The musical history is distinguished. Pablo Casals, the renowned
cellist, founded and directed the Barcelona Symphonic Orchestra until
the Spanish Civil War sent him into exile. Pianist Alicia de Larrocha
debuted at the Palau de la Musica Catalana, a showpiece of art
nouveau architecture, at age 7. Until recently, when Madrid's Teatro
Real began staging operas, the Liceo served as the only major opera
house in Spain. Singers Victoria de los Angeles, Jose Carreras and
Montserrat Caballe, all born in Barcelona, made their debuts at the
Liceo.</LD>
<LD>   The Liceo has become so popular that it is difficult to obtain a
ticket without a season subscription. The modern L'Auditori opened as
the new home of the Barcelona Symphonic Orchestra three years ago.</LD>
<TE>   For a traveler in Barcelona, the city's three music houses offer
special musical, architectural and historical experiences. Even if a
sightseer does not have time for a concert, the buildings themselves
are well worth a visit.</TE>
<TE>   The oldest is the Liceo, which opened in 1847. It is officially
known in Catalan, preferred over Spanish by the regional government,
as Gran Teatre del Liceu (Grand Theater of the Lyceum), but most
people use the shortened version of its Spanish name and call it the
Liceo.</TE>
<TE>   Its inner public rooms, like those of most European opera houses
of the mid-19th century, are sumptuous. A 1994 fire, started by a
workman, destroyed the stage, ceiling and seats of the auditorium.
The rebuilding took five years and restored the public spaces to
their original elegance. It is wondrous to ascend the red-carpeted
marble staircase, wander into the ornate Salon of Mirrors with its
ceiling paintings, golden chandeliers and classical columns, and gaze
upward at the five gilded balconies and the allegorical paintings
overhead.</TE>
<TE>   The 2,300-seat Liceo offers an array of opera, ballet, concerts
and recitals every month except August. Opera is the mainstay; its
ambitious operatic program for the 2002-03 season includes Henry
Purcell's "The Fairy Queen," Richard Strauss' "Ariadne auf Naxos,"
Mozart's "Don Giovanni," Tchaikovsky's "The Queen of Spades,"
Wagner's "Das Rheingold" and "Die Walkure" and Verdi's "Aida."</TE>
<TE>   The Palau de la Musica Catalana is the most breathtaking of the
three music houses, a stunning work of art nouveau -- a flowery
architectural and decorative style marked by whiplash curves, natural
forms and nationalist symbols. The style prospered at the turn of the
20th century. Given various names in different cities -- it was
called modernisme in Barcelona -- the style was derided as excessive
for many years but has returned to favor recently.</TE>
<TE>   The best-known artist of modernisme was the Catalan architect
Antonio Gaudi. The Palau de la Musica Catalana, completed in 1908,
was designed by one of his contemporaries, Lluis Domenech i Montaner.
Like several of Gaudi's buildings, the Palau has been declared a
World Heritage Site by the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization.</TE>
<TE>   I attended a performance by the London Symphony Orchestra one
night last season and watched many of the musicians gape in
astonishment as they filed onto the stage. The decoration of the
auditorium is so lavish that it defies the imagination of anyone
brought up in the functional concert halls built later in the 20th
century. Wagner's Valkyries on horseback, carved in white pumice,
storm across the proscenium. Muses, carved in stone and dressed in
mosaic, play their instruments on the wall behind the stage. A
stained-glass dome shines down on the audience.</TE>
<TE>   I recently took one of the guided daytime tours of the Palau and
found it unusually informative. Moreover, a daytime walk reveals how
Domenech i Montaner fashioned the stained-glass windows and dome to
bathe the interior with glistening sunlight. A concertgoer can't see
this at night.</TE>
<TE>   The facade of the Palau is almost as ornate as the interior. There
are an array of towers, an egg-shaped dome, mosaic columns and busts
of Bach, Beethoven and other composers. It is crowned by an
extraordinary mosaic mural of the singers of the Orfeo Catala, the
Barcelona choral group that originally commissioned the building and
that still sings there.</TE>
<TE>   The theater was renovated and enlarged in the 1980s. Additional
reconstruction, scheduled for completion in 2003, will include a
piazza for outdoor concerts.</TE>
<TE>   The Palau offers more than 300 performances a year (though, like
the Liceo, none in August) in its 1,970-seat concert hall and is the
main venue for visiting orchestras and soloists. The 2002-03 season
will include performances by the Vienna Symphony, the Royal
Philharmonic, the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields, the London
Symphony, the Berlin Philharmonic and the Bolshoi Orchestra and
Chorus.</TE>
<TE>   L'Auditori, the newest concert hall, is completely different from
the others. Designed by Jose Rafael Moneo, the Pritzker Prize-winning
Spanish architect who also designed the new Cathedral of Our Lady of
the Angels in Los Angeles, L'Auditori is a rectangular complex clad
in slabs of dark oxidized steel and fitted with interior walls of
light maple. There is no decoration in the 2,170-seat auditorium. Yet
this hall has a beauty of its own as it fans outward and upward under
a wonderful maple ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   L'Auditori was created as part of a vast public works program
started by Pasqual Maragall when he was mayor of Barcelona. Using
preparations for the 1992 Olympics as his pretext, Maragall
commissioned a host of projects. These included a new airport, a
museum of contemporary art, the opening of several miles of
beachfront, a massive housing development by the sea (used first by
the Olympic athletes), a marina surrounded by seafood restaurants and
monumental outdoor sculptures by Frank Gehry, Roy Lichtenstein, Claes
Oldenburg and others. Some projects, L'Auditori among them, were
delayed until after the Olympics. L'Auditori opened for concerts in
1999 but awaits completion of a chamber music hall.</TE>
<TE>   Barcelona needed L'Auditori as a home for its major concert
orchestra, the Barcelona Symphonic Orchestra and National Symphonic
Orchestra of Catalonia. It performed at the Palau for many years, but
that theater was so busy that the orchestra had difficulty scheduling
time for rehearsals. Having L'Auditori as a home has evidently helped
strengthen the ensemble. Los Angeles-born Lawrence Foster, who
directed it for the last seven years, took it on well-received tours
of the United States and Europe last season. After its concert at
Washington's Kennedy Center in February, Washington Post critic
Joseph McLellan wrote that "the orchestra's claim to rank among
Europe's major ensembles ... seemed well justified."</TE>
<TE>   The orchestra will have a new director this season, Barcelona-born
Ernest Martinez Izquierdo, with Foster as a principal guest
conductor. Izquierdo has developed a reputation in Barcelona as a
champion of contemporary and Catalan music.</TE>
<TE>   The orchestra has scheduled 80 concerts for the season. The
highlight may come in April when Radu Lupu is soloist for all five of
Beethoven's piano concertos during a three-day weekend. Foster will
conduct.</TE>
<TE>   Barcelona cannot boast an orchestra of the majesty of those of
Berlin and Vienna. Nor can it attract as many visiting virtuosos as
New York and London.</TE>
<TE>   But the range of its musical programming is as ambitious as that
of Paris. The variety of its operatic season rivals that of La Scala
in Milan.</TE>
<TE>   And, even more important for those who admire great architecture
as well as music, I know of no city in Europe that can match the
visual beauty that accompanies the sound in Barcelona's three unique
palaces of music.</TE>

<HD>Topanga, down to earth and yet worlds away</HD>
<DH>A vast state park and funky shops and eateries make the
canyon an appealing getaway close to home.</DH>
<SE></SE>

Angeles.</BD>
<DL>Topanga</DL>
<LD>Sampson, a gentle palomino with a wheat-colored mane and Topanga
upbringing, ambled along the dusty mountain trail, pausing every 10
yards to consider the piles of gravel threatening his path.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe the horse knew something we didn't. Soon after my husband
and I began a trail ride in the Santa Monica Mountains, Sampson
showed more interest in what was under his hoofs than in the
panoramic views of rolling, chaparral-cloaked countryside that
captivated his cargo.</LD>
<LD>   We learned later that the stacks of gravel were not destined to
pave paradise. They were an annual rainy-season precaution taken by a
community that we sensed, rather than saw, during our ride along
pleasantly deserted paths.</LD>
<TE>   This was good news -- for us and the horse. New development would
have been a jarring interruption to a weekend trip that felt more
like a tour of California's multilayered past than an extension of
its present. During our four years as Los Angeles residents, John and
I have cut around and through Topanga Canyon on our way to the beach.
But we never had time to stop and explore the area's eccentric shops,
galleries and restaurants, many of which still exude the offbeat vibe
that defined Topanga a half-century ago, when it became a haven for
folk artists and social activists.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of weeks ago, looking for a getaway that required neither
passage through airport security nor a dress code, we decided to take
a two-day tour of the cosmos that is Topanga.</TE>
<TE>   We set out from Toluca Lake after work Friday evening in time to
catch the remnants of sunset as we swerved south on Topanga Canyon
Boulevard. Our base for the weekend was the Topanga Ranch Motel, a
noirish cluster of 30 red and white bungalows down by Pacific Coast
Highway. The 80-year-old complex served as sleeping quarters for
workers who built Highway 1. Today the rooms fill up with European
travelers, solace-seeking writer types (think Raymond Chandler) and
surfers taking advantage of Topanga County Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The motel is one of about 10 businesses operating on borrowed time
since last year, when the California Department of Parks and
Recreation purchased the land they sit on as part of a plan to expand
Topanga State Park. Although many lower Topanga residents already
have vacated their homes, park officials estimate that the relocation
process for the popular Reel Inn restaurant and some other businesses
won't start until late next year. The Topanga Ranch Motel recently
was deemed eligible for the National Register of Historic Places,
which improves its chances for survival, though its ultimate fate
remains unclear.</TE>
<TE>   This tenuous status might explain why our room looked as if it had
not changed much since the 1920s, except for cable TV and a private
bathroom. All rooms have double beds only. For $70 plus tax a night,
we got one bed, a mini-fridge and partially obstructed beach views.
(Larger rooms with two beds go for $85.) The place was clean and
freshly painted, although I wished we had brought an extra blanket
and pillows to supplement the meager ones provided.</TE>
<TE>   We dropped off our bags and backtracked up Topanga Canyon
Boulevard for a late dinner at Abuelita's, one of the few places in
the area that keeps its lights burning well past midnight on
weekends. We settled into a corner table in the back room, ordered
margaritas and dug into bowls of tortilla soup and a perfectly
presented plate of chiles rellenos and enchiladas.</TE>
<TE>   Later we succumbed to a surprisingly sound night's sleep. Despite
our motel's proximity to the busy highway, noise was minimal in our
room, nestled in the back row of bungalows.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday morning we filled up on fluffy, Frisbee-size pancakes and
coffee at Pat's Topanga Grill, a popular breakfast and lunch spot
with its own hitching post, and headed to Carmen Cornielle's Escape
on Horseback stables about four miles away.</TE>
<TE>   John and I are inexperienced riders, but our guide's assurance
that the horses were "couches with legs" appealed to our strengths.
Our hourlong guided ride ($35 per person plus tip) followed the
Backbone Trail along the crest of the Santa Monicas, with views of
the urban sprawl we had left behind on one side and forested hills
shrouded by misty clouds on the other.</TE>
<TE>   As we headed back to town, we discovered the cool air wasn't the
only sign that fall had arrived. The grinning skeletons, stuffed
vultures and racks of sequined costumes at Hidden Treasures, a
vintage clothes and oddities shop on Topanga Canyon Boulevard, also
signaled that October's biggest day was near. Other worthwhile stops
include Angelite Om, a roadside shack with its own line of healing
products, and a nearby center called Pine Tree Circle, which houses
art galleries and Topanga Homegrown, a boutique selling handmade
purses, old Topanga postcards and other gifts.</TE>
<TE>   A quick change of clothes at the motel and a shared plate of
blackened Cajun sole and homemade coleslaw at the Reel Inn
reinvigorated us for a hike in Topanga State Park.</TE>
<TE>   The main entrance to the 11,000-acre-plus park sits at the end of
Entrada Road off Topanga Canyon Boulevard. In deference to our
morning companions, we bypassed Dead Horse Trail and parked at
Trippet Ranch, home of a nature center and launch pad for hikes that
feed into the 70-mile Backbone Trail. Ready for some exercise, we
opted for Eagle Rock Loop, a six-mile trek past views of ocean and
canyon that numbed any sense that civilization was within trotting
distance.</TE>
<TE>   Later that night, we feasted on thick, spicy chowder,
mesquite-grilled red snapper and ahi tuna at a dinner-only spot
called Froggy's Topanga Fish Market. The dining room, enlivened by a
fireplace and aquarium, was full, so we grabbed a table on the heated
patio. A couple of home-brewed ales and live acoustic guitar tempted
us to stay, but we had a curtain call to heed.</TE>
<TE>   Just up the road from Froggy's is the Will Geer Theatricum
Botanicum, a cliff-side amphitheater founded by TV's Grandpa Walton
as a refuge for blacklisted actors in the '50s. Show time for the
repertory production of "A Midsummer Night's Dream," which runs
through Oct. 20, was 8 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   I had been to an afternoon performance at the Theatricum before.
This time, huddling in a blanket under the stars proved even more
enjoyable, the natural surroundings morphing into the Bard's
fairy-tale setting.</TE>
<TE>   Still full from dinner and sated with good Shakespeare, we
bypassed the lively scene at Abuelita's on our way back to the motel.
This was probably a good move, because we ended up rising Sunday
morning in time for a walk on the beach and an early brunch on the
garden patio of the Inn of the Seventh Ray, one of the few places in
Topanga where valets and cell phones seem more at home than tie-dye
and Birkenstocks.</TE>
<TE>   The $25-per-person buffet of crab legs, salmon, fresh vegetables
and fruit-sweetened desserts was attracting lots of attention, but we
chose to order off the menu: an herb omelet for me, Belgian waffles
for John and whole-wheat cinnamon rolls for the road. The
restaurant's pretty creek-side setting was the highlight, easily
outshining the bland food and service.</TE>
<TE>   We ended our Topanga weekend with a bumpy drive to Red Rock Canyon
Park, a former Boy Scout camp now owned by the Santa Monica Mountains
Conservancy. We found ourselves again transported to another era --
one that recalled 1930s "B" westerns -- as we followed the sunbaked
trail surrounded by dramatic red sandstone formations.</TE>
<TE>   We agreed that even Sampson would have been impressed.</TE>

<HD>There's no reason for a pacemaker or defibrillator to zap
wanderlust</HD>
<DH>The implanted devices may complicate airport security
checks slightly, but they shouldn't cramp your road style.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathleen Doheny</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Less than a month after Charles "Chick" Woodfall, 78, got his
defibrillator implanted in 2000, he and his wife, Nancy, 72, traveled
in their nearly 27-foot motor home from the Palo Alto area to Morro
Bay, about 200 miles south.</LD>
<LD>   Three weeks after Jeyne Brown, 80, of Los Feliz, got her pacemaker
implanted in the summer of 2000, she took off to sightsee in Eastern
Europe.</LD>
<LD>   And barely a day after my dad, now 86, was discharged from the
hospital in Lafayette, Ind., last November with his new
defibrillator, he was on the road with my mother and sister, heading
for Thanksgiving dinner in Wichita, Kan. Had the doctor allowed it,
he would have taken the wheel for the 715-mile trip. Instead he tried
to be a patient passenger.</LD>
<TE>   As this trio proves, having an implanted pacemaker or
defibrillator to regulate heart rhythms is no reason to stay home --
at least not for long. Doctors who implant the devices say that as
long as reasonable precautions are taken during the early healing
period, most who are otherwise healthy can take to the road or the
sky with no problems. Exactly how soon varies from patient to
patient.</TE>
<TE>   As manufacturers make it simpler to check on these devices
remotely, it will soon be even easier to leave home knowing care will
be thorough. And if travelers take the time to learn about their
device and how to handle airport security, the road will be smoother
still.</TE>
<TE>   About 500,000 people in the United States have pacemakers, and
250,000 have implanted cardioverter defibrillators, or ICDs,
according to the North American Society of Pacing and
Electrophysiology, the association for cardiac arrhythmia
professionals. Pacemakers and ICDs are about the size of a pager and
are implanted under the skin near the collarbone. Electrodes connect
the device to the heart so it can help monitor and correct its
rhythm. Pacemakers stimulate the heart to beat at a rate that's best
for the individual patient. ICDs detect life-threatening heart
rhythms and "reset" or shock the heart to correct them.</TE>
<TE>   Resting a bit after the device is implanted is recommended, says
Dr. Kalyanam Shivkumar, director of interventional cardiac
electrophysiology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.
"Typically I ground patients for a week or so," he says. But he makes
the decision on a case-by-case basis.</TE>
<TE>   Whether traveling or at home, patients should keep the area around
the implant site clean, dry and covered, says Dr. Ravi Dave, an
interventional cardiologist at Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center and a
UCLA assistant professor of medicine. Don't raise the implant-side
arm above the shoulder during the healing period, which lasts for
about two weeks after implantation, advises Shivkumar. (And that
means no stuffing bags into the overhead compartment on airplanes, he
adds.) This allows the electrode leads to stabilize and helps the
incision heal.</TE>
<TE>   Dave suggests that once those with new pacemakers or
defibrillators begin to travel by air, they should "wear clothing
that will be easy to take off to show you have a pacemaker. I've had
patients who have been asked to show security officials at airports
[the devices]."</TE>
<TE>   Taking along your implant ID card is a must, doctors say, to prove
you do have the device, especially in this era of tightened airport
security.</TE>
<TE>   As for the security checkpoints, manufacturers say the airport
security system and the hand-held metal detector, or wand, are
typically safe for those with implanted devices. But passengers who
are not comfortable with the idea should request hand security
checks.</TE>
<TE>   "If you walk normally through the airport security system, it will
not reset a pacemaker or defibrillator," says Scott Papillon of
Medtronic, a manufacturer of the devices. Likewise, he says, the wand
that is sometimes passed over a passenger's body is OK as long as
security personnel "don't stop it at the site and hold it there."
Pacemaker and defibrillator wearers who request a hand search are
typically accommodated, Papillon says.</TE>
<TE>   Wands and airport security systems are generally safe for those
with pacemakers or ICDs, agrees Peter Gove of St. Jude Medical Inc.
But an implant may set off the alarm on the security system, he says.</TE>
<TE>   If you're traveling alone and are wary of leaving your bags on the
X-ray belt while you go off for a private search, call the airline
beforehand to explain the situation and ask if you can get a
wheelchair when you arrive at the airport, suggests Ron Pelayo,
assistant federal security director for the Department of
Transportation at Los Angeles International Airport. "Then let the
wheelchair person keep tabs on your bags," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Know your pace</TE>
<TE>   Travelers with pacemakers or defibrillators should know basic
information about the device, such as the setting, or heart rate. A
setting of 72 is common, Dave says. If you know that, you can do a
crude test by taking your pulse. If it is close to the heart rate
setting, you can be fairly sure the implant is set properly.</TE>
<TE>   "Patient education is critical," Shivkumar agrees. "Know your
device. Know the brand and the make. Rarely does travel affect a
pacemaker or defibrillator. But if someone is going away for six
months to a year, it is wise to have it checked out before leaving."</TE>
<TE>   Patients who travel can send data about their devices back to
their doctor, just as some do from home. For years, patients with
pacemakers have been able to send an electrocardiogram over phone
lines using a trans- telephonic monitoring transmitter. This does,
however, have limitations. "That only shows you what the
electrocardiogram is at the moment they are hooked up," says Dr.
Kenneth Riff of Medtronic. And it is not useful for defibrillators,
because physicians need to know if the device has shocked the heart
back into a normal rhythm and what kinds of abnormal rhythms have
occurred, he says.</TE>
<TE>   A newer system can help those with defibrillators transmit
information to their doctor over the Internet. Medtronic's CareLink
Monitor system was approved by the Food and Drug Administration
earlier this year for defibrillator patients, Riff says. (The company
also hopes to get approval for the monitor system for use with
pacemakers.) Using this system, the patient holds a small
antenna-like device over the implant, collecting information that the
monitor then digitally transmits through a standard phone line. The
information includes not just an electrocardiogram but also a history
of abnormal rhythms and corrective actions taken. The data are stored
on a secure server, and both doctor and patient can access them
online.</TE>
<TE>   Defibrillator cannot yet be programmed via the Internet, Riff
says, so if corrective action is needed, the patient would be
referred to a nearby doctor.</TE>
<TE>   The system is expected to be a boon for patients who divide their
time between two homes, Riff says. Generally, defibrillator patients
are checked every three months, he says, and pacemaker patients every
six or 12 months.</TE>
<TE>   Some patients say they feel more able to travel after the device
is implanted. "There's a feeling of security that the thing is in
there," Woodfall says. He and his wife travel as frequently as they
did before. So do my dad and my mom, who has a pacemaker.</TE>
<TE>   A few days after Thanksgiving last year, they drove home. "The
hardest part was waiting for the implant site to heal," Dad says.
Otherwise, "I was able to do everything I wanted."</TE>

<HD>Need roadside help? It's closer than you think</HD>
<DH>Free towing is offered by many companies and clubs. Your
car maker may feature it as well.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane Engle</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>YOUR car sputters to a stop on a remote road far from home. Who ya
gonna call?</LD>
<LD>   For many travelers, the answer is AAA, which marks its 100th
anniversary this year. From a nine-club alliance in 1902, it has
grown into a network of 79 auto clubs in the United States and Canada
with more than 45 million members. About one in five U.S. adults
belongs to it, officials estimate.</LD>
<LD>   In car-crazy Southern California, home to AAA's biggest affiliate
(with more than 5 million members), the auto club is only slightly
less an icon than the Hollywood sign, and probably better loved.
Locals rely on it for everything from emergency tows to navigating
the state Department of Motor Vehicles bureaucracy.</LD>
<TE>   But if AAA is the 800-pound gorilla of roadside assistance, it's
not alone in the jungle. In fact, you may already have access to free
emergency tows, whether you belong to AAA or not. You just have to
know where to look. Among organizations offering such services are
car makers, credit card companies, auto and travel insurers and
various independent groups.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost anybody who drives ought to have roadside assistance,"
says consumer advocate Ed Perkins, former ombudsman for the American
Society of Travel Agents. The question is, what kind?</TE>
<TE>   When evaluating a program, it's useful to ask:</TE>
<TE>   Is there a cap on the distance or on the number of tows?</TE>
<TE>   Am I limited to a particular dealer or towing company?</TE>
<TE>   Is my car covered in my driveway, or only away from home?</TE>
<TE>   Are other household members covered?</TE>
<TE>   Am I covered when traveling in any car, not just my own?</TE>
<TE>   Belonging to more than one plan may be worthwhile because
different plans cover different circumstances. Many memberships
include maps, trip planning, hotel discounts and other extras. This
sampling deals only with roadside service:</TE>
<TE>   Motor clubs: The not-for-profit AAA is by far the biggest motor
club network. (In the interest of full disclosure: I'm a member.) It
draws on about 13,000 towing services. Costs and benefits vary by
club.</TE>
<TE>   Basic annual memberships range from $38 to $76 per year, including
free towing for several miles. For $15 to $52 more, you can become an
AAA Plus member, with tows up to 100 miles. Extra household members
cost more. The Automobile Club of Southern California charges $44 for
basic membership (plus a one-time $20 initiation fee). You get four
free tows a year; basic members are limited to seven miles per tow.
The plan covers you in any vehicle you're in. AAA Plus membership
costs $27 more. (800) 222-4357 (for emergency service; nonmembers can
join on the spot), www.aaa.com.</TE>
<TE>   There are other, smaller clubs. GE Financial, a subsidiary of GE,
operates several, including the BP Motor Club (formerly Amoco's motor
club, dating to 1966) and Signature's Nationwide Auto Club. Together
they serve more than 4 million members and draw on more than 6,000
towing services, spokesman Gene Ullrich says. Signature's annual
membership is $79, including one additional household member, and
includes free towing up to five miles. (800) 323-2002,
www.autoclub.com.</TE>
<TE>   The new, for-profit Better World Club bills itself as "the only
environmentally friendly roadside assistance and travel club." It
promises to donate 1% of revenue to environmental cleanup. Founded in
July, it has 1,500 members but has been growing at 100% a month, says
BWC President Mitch Rofsky. Basic annual membership is $49.95; for
$15 more, it covers the household. Four tows up to five miles each
per year. (866) 304-7540, www.betterworldclub.com.</TE>
<TE>   Auto makers: About 80% of new vehicles are covered for 24-hour
road service under the warranty, but only half of owners are aware of
it, J.D. Power and Associates found in a 2000 survey. Typically
you're covered only for your own vehicle, and it must be serviced by
a dealership. Ford and Mercury, for instance, include such service
for 36 months or 36,000 miles. Honda and some others offer it in
optional service contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Some of these programs are highly rated. Cadillac was No. 1 and
Mercedes-Benz No. 2 in customer satisfaction rankings of emergency
roadside assistance by nearly 8,000 car owners in another J.D. Power
and Associates survey in 2001. (Nos. 3 and 4 were networks that
provide service to a variety of car makers and groups. AAA was No.
5.)</TE>
<TE>   Credit cards: Some cards' contracts refer to travel or emergency
aid, but generally you pay for services they arrange. Last month
American Express began offering free roadside assistance with its
Rewards Green and Gold credit cards. Annual memberships begin at $65
for the Green card. The service uses more than 30,000 towing
stations. Distance limits are liberal and there's no cap on tows, but
you're not covered in your driveway or for routine commuting.</TE>
<TE>   Insurers: Many car insurers will add roadside assistance to your
policy for less than $15 per year, including an unlimited number of
tows--handy for AAA members who have exceeded their annual limit. But
you typically have to pay for the towing yourself, then get
reimbursed.</TE>
<TE>   At Allstate, the amount is generally capped at $25 or $50 per
call, a spokeswoman said. At State Farm, my agent quoted a $3.52
annual premium, including an unlimited number of tows to the nearest
garage and mechanical labor up to one hour. Travel Guard
International wraps road assistance into some of its travel insurance
plans. (800) 826-1300, www.travelguard.com.</TE>
<TE>   Who's the speediest among these various groups? It's AAA, with an
average response time of 35 minutes per call, J.D. Power and
Associates reported last year.</TE>

striking $200-million building, will take place Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Rising like a temple of modernity on the waterfront of this
ancient city, the library aspires to revive the concept of its
forebear, the Bibliotheca Alexandrina. Two thousand years ago, that
library is said to have held about 700,000 scrolls encompassing the
bulk of human knowledge at the time. It was gradually destroyed,
starting with Julius Caesar's invasion in the 1st century BC.</LD>
<LD>   The new library may eventually hold 8 million items. But it starts
with only half a million, mainly relating to the Mediterranean region
and its cultures, in various languages, including English.</LD>
<TE>   Although it may be short on books for now, the library stands tall
as an architectural jewel. Its dominant feature is a gigantic
circular roof, nearly 500 feet in diameter, made of blue and green
glass panels. The disc-like structure tilts toward the sea, where the
ancient palaces of Cleopatra and Antony lie submerged. The
inclination gives the impression of movement, as if the disc is
actually rising from the ground.</TE>
<TE>   The building, designed by the Norwegian architectural firm
Snohetta, is immersed in a reflecting pool. The raised side of the
disc is overlaid with 4,600 slabs of dark gray granite from Aswan,
inscribed with calligraphy from around the world. Also in the complex
are a spherical planetarium, museum and conference hall.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, the principal reading room is an open area as big as New
York's Grand Central Terminal. Its seven levels of cascading terraces
hold about 2,000 seats, each with a view of the sea. Visitors can
read under natural light penetrating through the glass roof.</TE>
<TE>   Support from UNESCO and contributions from the international
community have made the project possible. The promise that the
library will someday become a beacon of knowledge for all humanity
raises a few skeptical eyebrows. But as a tourist attraction it is
without doubt spectacular.</TE>
<TE>   The library is open daily except Tuesdays. Hours vary. Entrance to
the library is about $2; there are extra fees for the planetarium,
museum and exhibitions. 011-20-3-483-9999, www.bibalex.org.</TE>

<HD>For some, only superstition appeases the travel gods</HD>
<DH>At times, avoiding the 13th floor or clutching an amulet is
a fine way to cope.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Spano</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Traveling is sometimes like putting yourself in the hands of
mischievous gods. When they're feeling benign, a trip unfolds
smoothly. But when the gods are in a mood, you miss connections, your
hotel loses your reservations and on the plane you get stuck next to
a screaming baby.</LD>
<LD>   To appease the gods, in the past I habitually called my parents
from the airport before my plane departed. And I still try to do a
small good deed, like yielding to another driver on the way to the
airport or giving my seat to a senior on a crowded shuttle, to
accumulate good karma before leaving home. No matter how frazzled or
rushed I am, I practice this ritual. It doesn't make sense to court
disaster by forgetting to do it.</LD>
<LD>   I'm generally not superstitious, but travel seems to bring it out
in me -- and others. Some people wouldn't dream of hitting the road
without their favorite jade amulet or St. Christopher medal. Sharon
Wingler, editor of TravelAloneandLoveIt.com and a flight attendant
for Delta Air Lines for more than 30 years, says she often sees
passengers touch the outside of the plane as they're boarding. Since
Sept. 11, she and many of her colleagues have begun wearing angel
pins on their lapels.</LD>
<TE>   Nancy Kelly, the owner of Kelly Cruises travel agency in Oak
Brook, Ill., has a client who refuses to take a cruise during a full
moon. To keep bad luck at bay, Holland America ships were built with
a coin beneath the mast, as dictated by mariners' lore.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's the bugaboo about the number 13, which makes some
people avoid flying on Friday the 13th. Marybeth Williams, an agent
at Carlson Wagonlit Travel in Laguna Niguel, avoids seat assignments
in row 13 when booking airline tickets so she won't have to make a
change if a superstitious client objects. High-rise hotels (and other
buildings) often lack a 13th floor, and certain guests prefer not to
stay in a room numbered 13, says Kirby Payne, chairman of the
American Hotel &amp; Motel Assn. in Washington, D.C. Payne, who is also
the president of a hotel management firm and is definitely not
superstitious, nonetheless avoids 13 when numbering rooms on a floor
to avoid trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Stuart A. Vyse, author of "Believing in Magic: The Psychology of
Superstition" (Oxford University Press, 1997), says a fear of 13
stems partly from the biblical Last Supper, celebrated by the 12
Apostles and soon-to-be-crucified Jesus.</TE>
<TE>   A frequent flier who gets anxious in turbulence, Vyse once was
unnerved to find himself sitting in row 13 on a rough flight. But he
recovered, he says, by drawing on his rational mind, recalling that
if the plane crashed, every row would be at risk, not just the 13th.</TE>
<TE>   After all, superstitions are irrational beliefs people like me
sometimes follow without really believing. "It's Pascal's wager,"
Vyse says, referring to an idea set forth by Blaise Pascal, the 17th
century French mathematician and theologian. Pascal decided that if
the odds of the existence of God were even, it was worth embracing
the idea, given the heavenly rewards promised to believers.</TE>
<TE>   Psychologists like Vyse and Jerilyn Ross, director of the Ross
Center for Anxiety &amp; Related Disorders in Washington, D.C., suggest
that superstitiousness stems from anxiety caused by the apparent
randomness of events, to which travelers, who put themselves in the
hands of unpredictable gods every time they leave home, are
especially vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   I rack up good karma before a trip; a colleague clutches her
rosary during takeoff and landing. "People use certain familiar,
comforting rituals to feel they have control over things," Ross says.</TE>
<TE>   There's an important difference between appeasing erratic gods
through small acts of superstition and being phobic, which imposes
serious limitations on sufferers and needs to be recognized and
treated. People with phobias, Ross says, are afraid of panic itself
-- for instance, how they'll feel when the door to the airplane
closes. One of her patients recently told her that the thought of
panicking on an aircraft was far more frightening than the worry of a
terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers traumatized by the events of Sept. 11 also can be helped
by some of the measures Ross suggests for people who are phobic about
flying. These include getting to the airport early, eating
nutritiously, meeting the pilots and flight attendants, and telling
airport security about anything that seems suspicious.</TE>
<TE>   But Americans have kept traveling. In an August poll conducted by
Yesawich, Pepperdine &amp; Brown, a Florida-based travel marketing and
consulting firm, only 1 in 9 respondents said that fear of more
terrorism would change travel plans.</TE>
<TE>   Concerns about safety have intensified, however. This was
especially apparent on the anniversary of Sept. 11. On that day I
flew from Washington, D.C., to Los Angeles. It was my way of marking
the anniversary and of trying to keep my grip in the face of
capricious travel gods and a random universe. But I did a few good
deeds beforehand. It's only rational to hang on to my superstitions.</TE>

<LD>EUROPE: A whirl of holiday markets in Austria, Germany and the Czech
Republic</LD>
<LD>   Pack your mittens and introduce yourself to Father Christmas this
fall at Old World holiday markets in Germany, Austria and the Czech
Republic.</LD>
<LD>   The markets, Christkindlesmarkt,  are a holiday tradition dating
to the Middle Ages. They feature merchandise such as ornaments, toys,
music boxes and glassware. Add to that a dusting of snow, the scent
of roasting chestnuts and the taste of mulled wine.</LD>
<TE>   "It's the way Europeans get in the spirit of the holiday," said
German native Gerhard Meng, who is leading three tours this fall.
"It's noncommercial, just local craftsmen." Christmas markets are
held throughout Europe beginning at the end of November, turning town
squares and narrow lanes into gathering places for natives and
tourists alike. Some markets are small and run for just a few days;
others, like the huge Munich and Nuremberg fairs in Germany, run
through Christmas Eve.</TE>
<TE>   Tours to the fairs are available from several travel agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Meng's tours, ranging from eight to 10 days, depart on Nov. 29,
Dec. 7 and Dec. 16 and visit various market cities, including Munich,
Heidelberg and Seiffen, Germany; Salzburg and Scharding, Austria; and
Prague, Czech Republic. The Dec. 16 tour will be in Europe on
Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   Cost: From $1,685 per person, double occupancy, including
accommodations, bus transportation, city tours by local guides, most
meals, taxes and service charges. Round-trip air fare from Los
Angeles is not included.</TE>

<TE>   Caribbean: Bike and cruise your way through the islands</TE>
<TE>   You can ship out for the Caribbean Islands--and enjoy a healthy
dose of cycling in port--on a bike-and-cruise tour planned from Jan.
26 to Feb. 2.</TE>
<TE>   The cruise, aboard the Norwegian Sky, sails from San Juan, Puerto
Rico, and visits St. Lucia, Barbados, Dominica, St. Kitts and St.
Thomas. Days are spent biking, with time allotted for beachside
picnics, snorkeling and swimming. Nights are spent aboard ship,
sailing from port to port.</TE>
<TE>   "While other cruise-ship passengers visit downtown areas, we
cycle," said Linda Thompson, who has been organizing the tours since
1989.</TE>
<TE>   Cost: From $1,044 per person, including seven nights on the ship,
meals, evening entertainment, bike tour and port taxes. Optional
bicycle rental is $100. Round-trip air fare from Los Angeles to
Puerto Rico is not included.</TE>

Hawaii and Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico: Small delights at shrimp festival on the Baja shore</TE>
<TE>   Explore the Baja fishing village of San Felipe on a two-night tour
that coincides with the city's annual Shrimp Festival. The
celebration marks the beginning of fishing season in the popular Gulf
of California village.</TE>
<TE>   The tour, which departs San Diego on Nov. 1, travels down Baja's
Pacific Coast to Ensenada, then crosses the peninsula to San Felipe,
120 miles south of the U.S. border. The return is through Mexicali.</TE>
<TE>   "The Shrimp Festival is very much a hometown affair," said Barbara
Littlemore of Baja California Tours. "They have a street fair, shrimp
dishes, strolling mariachis."</TE>
<TE>   Cost: $279 per person, double occupancy, including round-trip bus
transportation from San Diego, accommodations at the Costa Azul
Hotel, bilingual guide, four meals and shrimp festival activities.</TE>

<TE>   Canada: Animal watch in the world's polar bear capital</TE>
<TE>   Get up close and personal with polar bears on an Arctic tundra
tour that visits the far-flung outpost of Churchill, on the shore of
Hudson Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Churchill, which has dubbed itself the Polar Bear Capital of the
World, is Canada's most northern seaport. It is in the middle of the
polar bear migration route, and the animals are seen frequently from
mid-October to early November as they gather to await the freezing of
Hudson Bay ice so they can begin their annual seal hunt. Six-day
tours will depart on Oct. 25, Nov. 2 and Nov. 12. The tour begins in
Winnipeg, with a three-hour flight north to Churchill. Two days are
spent searching for bears in tundra buggies -- six-wheel-drive
vehicles used for regional travel. Another day is spent on a walking
tour to the edge of the boreal forest.</TE>
<TE>   Cost: $1,725 per person, double occupancy, including air fare from
Winnipeg to Churchill, some meals, accommodations, transportation,
guides and activities. Round-trip air fare from LAX to Winnipeg is
not included.</TE>

city.</TE>
<TE>   The trip will be led by Joe Hannibal of Cal Poly Pomona and Luisa
Cohrs of Rio Hondo College, Whittier. It will include visits to the
Accademia and Correr Museum, the Ducal Palace, the Frari and the
Guggenheim Museum.</TE>

<DH>Not every advance is a step forward.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A fleet of tall ships sailed into port. Acres of weather-stained
canvas luffing against an early autumn breeze; vines of three-strand
rope climbing heavenward; smartly turned details to catch the eye:
baggy wrinkles and monkey's fists and ships' bells, polished wood,
tar, pendants, heaving lines, hawsers, sunburned faces, the bouncy
sound of a concertina.... It was enough to make a fellow feel as if
the world was still firmly affixed to its hinges.</LD>
<LD>   Nostalgia is nothing new, of course. But I see it's the fashion
just now. As the New York Times put it, "The Old Days Never Looked So
Good."</LD>
<LD>   Well, fine. In my own case, this proves that if you stick with
your ways long enough, you're bound to find yourself caught up in a
craze sooner or later. I've long believed that we should reconsider
whether Ned Ludd really was as loony as his critics claimed.</LD>
<TE>   Ludd, you might recall, was the apprentice stocking maker who
smashed a newly invented knitting frame in Britain. That was 183
years ago, and he was protesting the dawn of industrialization. The
royal army tamped down that uprising quickly. But legions of us
Luddites now carry on more quietly, questioning whether everything
that goes by the name of progress actually is.</TE>
<TE>   T.S. Eliot summed it up this way: "Where is the life we have lost
in living? / Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? / Where
is the knowledge we have lost in information?"</TE>
<TE>   So old is good again. And not just on the waterfront but in
movies, in music, in theater, furniture, in martinis, in fountain
pens, in aloha shirts, in surf wear, in manners and probably a lot of
other things that I'm not "with it" enough to recognize yet. My wife
is no longer lonely being a knitter.</TE>
<TE>   If nothing else, looking over our shoulders establishes a
benchmark by which we can calibrate what we are gaining, if anything,
from the accelerating onslaught of newness.</TE>
<TE>   Wait, I know. There is much we can be thankful for in this modern
age. Anesthesia, for instance, and ice cubes, paved roads and the
30-year gain in American lifespan over the last century.</TE>
<TE>   But not every advance gets us somewhere. For instance,
timekeeping. We have wristwatches today that adjust themselves by
radio signals from an atomic clock, and they maintain accuracy to a
billionth of a second a year. So how come everyone still shows up
late?</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, an occasional draft of nostalgia is a good reminder of
what we're losing in our pell-mell race to tomorrow. Namely our
regard for beauty.</TE>
<TE>   A topmast schooner is an intrinsically fetching thing to behold,
today the same as two centuries ago. No one put it as plainly as
Keats: "A thing of beauty is a joy forever."</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, a whole army of industrial designers has barely
instilled a slightest trace of eye appeal or warmth to a computer.</TE>
<TE>   My own explanation for the nation's fling with nostalgia can be
reduced to two words: pubescence and marketing.</TE>
<TE>   We are told again and again that youth rules in our consumerist
culture. In truth, teenagers and young adults have less money than
their elders. But that doesn't seem to matter much. Their throne is
granted by their willingness to spend according to what's hot, or
"in," or said to be the next big thing. That is, they respond to
marketing more willingly. So naturally they receive the king's share
of attention from marketers.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the ceaseless bombardment does not spare the rest
of us. It is essential, we are told hundreds of times a day, to get
with it and keep ahead. Over time, this skewers perceptions of our
society, and sometimes the reality too.</TE>
<TE>   Thus we have the modern creation of light beer, which is beer with
the addition of water and a corresponding reduction of taste,
resulting in a beverage that neither satisfies nor slims but sells
like mad.</TE>
<TE>   Those of us who understand that an old-fashioned leather-bound
address book is far lovelier, every bit as functional and far more
durable than a soon-to-be-obsolete electronic personal assistant feel
the vertigo of being left out when change is constantly mistaken for
progress. Where do we reach for a handhold? Backward, naturally. "The
past," observed Daniel Webster, "is at least secure."</TE>

<HD>Listen Up When Latinos Speak, Chief Bratton</HD>
<DH>LAPD diversity and gang crime top their list.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Frank del Olmo</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Given how troubled the recent history of the Los Angeles Police
Department has been, the City Council vote confirming Mayor James K.
Hahn's selection of William J. Bratton to head the LAPD for the next
five years was notably noncontentious. In the end, the only
dissenters from Hahn's choice were Councilman Nate Holden and a small
group of Mexican American activists.</LD>
<LD>   Holden has spent the last few years being City Hall's
quasi-official contrarian, so his "no" vote was not that surprising.</LD>
<LD>   But it would be a mistake to dismiss the criticism leveled at
Bratton by the handful of Latinos who would have preferred that Hahn
select another finalist for the LAPD's top job, Oxnard Police Chief
Art Lopez. There is more to their complaint than ethnic politics or
wounded pride among LAPD insiders who wanted Lopez, an LAPD member
for 27 years.</LD>
<TE>   A closer look at Bratton's critics, and what they said, suggests
that the new chief would be well advised to reach out to them, as he
did to the Latin American Law Enforcement Assn., or La Ley, which
represents many of the LAPD's 3,000 Latino officers.</TE>
<TE>   While not as well known as the Latino leaders who supported
Bratton, the members of the ad hoc Latino committee that faulted
Hahn's selection of the former head of the Boston and New York police
departments are no slouches. One, Dora Sanchez, is the president of
LACECA, the association of Latino city employees. Two, Art Madrid and
Al Rubalcava, are former LAPD officers who between them gave more
than 60 years of service to the city before retiring. Another is a
veteran gang-crime expert, Gus Frias, who has spent more time trying
to root out L.A.'s endemic street gangs than many better-known gang
workers -- usually without publicity and often quite effectively.
Their committee had specific concerns, and statistics to back them
up, that they believe Bratton must address.</TE>
<TE>   One is an internal problem. The LAPD has become one-third Latino
and the city it serves almost one-half Latino. Despite the fact that
many young Latinos are drawn to law enforcement careers, there is a
dearth of Latino leadership in the LAPD. Of 112 command officers,
only 12 are Latino. So one of the specific demands that the Latino
committee made of Bratton was to have a policy of ensuring
departmental leadership that reflects the diversity of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "How can there be mentoring when there are so few role models?"
says Rubalcava, a former La Ley president. "No wonder so many young
officers tell themselves--almost subconsciously--that trying for
promotions isn't worth the hassle, and prefer to stay where they are,
in patrol or detective work."</TE>
<TE>   But the committee's other demand is even more significant. It
wants Bratton held accountable for controlling the city's
long-standing gang problem, and particularly addressing the
increasing number of gang killings.</TE>
<TE>   "So far all I've heard Bratton talk about is quality-of-life
crimes, like eliminating graffiti," says Madrid. "It'll take a lot
more than that to deal with some of the gangs on the Eastside that
have been around for 30 or 40 years."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the LAPD's own statistics indicate that, as of August,
gang homicides in the Eastside's Hollenbeck Division were up to 32,
twice as many as by August 2000. Gang killings doubled in the Rampart
Division, from nine by August 2001 to 18 this year. And in the South
Bureau, which covers the black and Latino neighborhoods that sprawl
from the Santa Monica Freeway to the harbor, gang homicides stood at
an appalling 119 as of August.</TE>
<TE>   "The killings in our community are the key issue," says Frias.
"And I worry that he doesn't know this community.... Even someone who
does know it, like [Los Angeles County Sheriff] Lee Baca, is
struggling to get his arms around the gang problem.... Bratton sure
won't do it by focusing on graffiti, or hassling every kid with a
shaved head or baggy pants.... Eventually you need substance to match
the rhetoric."</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be watching him," Rubalcava says of Bratton.</TE>
<TE>   Good advice, I'd say, from some Latinos skeptical about the city's
new police chief.</TE>

<HD>Hezbollah Hate With a U.S. Link</HD>
<DH>Subsidiaries' TV ad money serves an odious goal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Avi Jorisch</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Why are local Lebanese subsidiaries of major American
corporations--like PepsiCo, Procter &amp; Gamble and Western
Union--lending comfort and support to terrorists by advertising on
Hezbollah television?</LD>
<LD>   Al Manar--the Arabic word for beacon--is the official television
station of Lebanon's Party of God, more commonly known as Hezbollah.
That Iranian-backed and -funded group has been implicated in the
attacks against the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut that killed 241
Americans in 1982, the U.S. Embassy in Beirut that killed 12
Americans in 1984, the Israeli Embassy and Jewish cultural center in
Buenos Aires that killed 85 people in 1994 and numerous other
terrorist attacks, murders and kidnappings over the years.</LD>
<LD>   Al Manar is Hezbollah's outreach to the world, a self-described
"station of resistance." Founded in 1991 as a mom-and-pop operation
that barely reached beyond Beirut's southern suburbs, Al Manar now
transmits via satellite 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with the
expressed goal of waging "psychological warfare against the Zionist
enemy."</LD>
<TE>   As Al Manar's Chairman of the Board Nayef Krayem said to me,
"There is no act of resistance that can be classified as terrorism."
It is no surprise then that Al Manar's programming glorifies suicide
bombers, exhorts Palestinians to kill Jews and revels in the carnage
of terrorist attacks on civilians. The fact that Al Manar almost
always has immediate footage of terrorist outrages or Hezbollah
attacks across the Israel-Lebanon border adds to the speculation that
Al Manar officials are themselves party to Hezbollah's operational
planning. As emerged during a recent North Carolina trial of two
Hezbollah operatives, Al Manar employees conduct pre-operational
surveillance of potential targets and engage in other logistical and
financial support activities for terrorist acts.</TE>
<TE>   Hezbollah, of course, targets America as well as Israel. Sheik
Hassan Izz-Adin, in his capacity as a member of Hezbollah's political
council and director of Hezbollah's media-relations unit (which
directly oversees Al Manar), said to me: "America will fall just like
the Romans and the British. While it now controls the world, this
will change. We cannot accept American domination and American
terrorist actions."</TE>
<TE>   What is most shocking is not the vitriol of Al Manar's message or
its high-tech facility for international broadcasting. What is most
shocking is the extent of advertising it carries by local
subsidiaries of major U.S. corporations. The fact that they advertise
only on Al Manar's local television outlet in Lebanon, not on Al
Manar's satellite station, suggests they want to keep their
commercial links to terrorists away from the prying eyes of
U.S.-based viewers.</TE>
<TE>   For Americans, advertising on Al Manar may not only be in bad
taste; it may be illegal. Hezbollah is officially named a "specially
designated terrorist group" under Executive Order 13224. This
designation empowers the U.S. government to impose financial
sanctions against those "that support or otherwise associate" with
Hezbollah.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Executive Order 12947 and the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act prohibit the provision of "financial,
material or technological support" to any specially designated
terrorist group.</TE>
<TE>   And the U.S. code makes it illegal to "knowingly provide material
support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization." At the
very least, these statutes and executive orders provide the basis for
an investigation into the legality of Al Manar advertising by U.S.
firms.</TE>
<TE>   But even if there are technical loopholes behind which corporate
lawyers can hide--i.e., it is the subsidiary's fault, not
headquarters'--should they? After all, the millions of Americans who
hold stock in these companies would be outraged to know that these
all-American brands are used to help celebrate murder, terrorism,
anti-Semitism and coarse hatred of American values.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, maybe corporate honchos have no idea what is going on
in their names in faraway Lebanon. Regardless, all commercial
dealings between U.S. companies, their subsidiaries abroad and Al
Manar must come to an immediate end.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, with American lives put at stake every day by the
venality of Hezbollah and its allies in the jihad against America,
Pepsi and other U.S. corporations should be put on notice--by
shareholders and the Department of Justice alike--that advertising on
Al Manar is not the choice of a "new generation," or any other
generation for that matter.</TE>

<HD>Some Juror Exclusion Policies Are a Real Crime</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jonathan Turley</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last week, a court in Florida issued a clear command to members of
the clergy: When it comes to juries, thou shall not serve. In a
victory that has attracted national attention, prosecutors convinced
an appellate court that members of the clergy may be stricken by
prosecutors as inherently too soft on defendants.</LD>
<LD>   The clergy is not alone. Across the country, a debate rages over
which groups can be constitutionally stricken from juries. The Rev.
Robert Cook may have been relieved that he would not be serving on
the battery trial of Jason Rodriguez. However, Cook soon learned that
the reason the prosecutor struck him from the jury was not about what
he said but what he was: a minister.</LD>
<TE>   Florida Assistant State Atty. Alan Johnson explained that "this is
a person [who] listens and deals with the problems of a large number
of his community. That's what is troublesome." The prosecutor insists
that he was simply performing the time-honored practice of jury
selection, following his hunches on the most favorable jurors. Yet,
these "hunches" have often been based on prejudice or stereotype. For
example, it was long believed that African American jurors were
generally pro- defense. In 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court found such
race-based challenges to be unconstitutional. However, late last
year, a federal court in Pennsylvania held that prosecutors can
strike Italian Americans based on their Italian surnames.</TE>
<TE>   The premise of the most recent category for exclusion is that
clergy members are "too sympathetic." Of course, there is no
statistical proof that clergy members are more sympathetic to
defendants.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, some religions make John Ashcroft look like an ACLU
lawyer. Recently in Iran, a murderer was sentenced to be placed into
a sack and thrown off a cliff. If he survived the rocky decline, he
was to be removed and hanged. Hard to see any clerical mollycoddling
there.</TE>
<TE>   Florida is not the only state that allows exclusion of clergy by
statute or through peremptory strikes. What is most disturbing is not
just the exclusion of certain groups but those that make the cut. For
example, in 1996, an alternate juror, Barbara Adams, was allowed to
sit on the high-profile trial of former Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker
despite the fact that she was a self-professed officer in the United
Federation of Planets. Adams showed up every day in a Star Fleet
dress uniform with both "phaser" and "tricorder." She was removed
from the jury only because she violated the court's directive to not
speak with the media. A phaser-toting Star Fleet officer is one
thing, but a rabbi is something else entirely.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the rulings on clergy and Italian Americans only
deepen the debate over the purpose of such peremptory challenges in
jury selection. While defendants are assured of a randomly selected
jury of their peers, we allow lawyers to remove people based on
personal characteristics that do not show bias or conflicts with a
particular defendant or case. Lawyers are allowed to pick and prune a
jury into a more appealing image for their clients. At the end of
this process, American juries often look as natural and random as
coiffed French poodles.</TE>
<TE>   We can hardly guarantee a jury that reflects a community when we
actively exclude whole categories of that community. Of course,
categorical exclusion may be welcome news when you are sitting next
to a guy dressed as a Klingon warrior in a jury pool.</TE>
<TE>   However, there are high costs to such exclusions since these
groups help define our collective values of justice. To exclude them
from the jury is like crafting an artificial society without
particular ethnic or cultural influences. That may serve the
interests of a defendant or a prosecutor but it will hardly serve the
interests of justice.</TE>

<HD>The Eagle Has Landed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Readers this morning might notice a cleaner, sharper image of the
Times eagle in the masthead at the top of this page. This emblem is a
representation of the Times bronze eagle sculpture, which weighs more
than 200 pounds and has a wingspan of 7 1/2 feet. The eagle statue
was designed by Gutzon Borglum, the noted sculptor of Mt. Rushmore,
while he was living in Sierra Madre in the 1890s. The statue stood
atop three successive Los Angeles Times buildings from the late 19th
century through the mid-20th century; it now stands in the Times
lobby as a symbol of courage and strength.</LD>
<LD>   The eagle emblem first appeared on the newspaper's banner and was
later placed on the editorial page, where it disappeared and
reappeared over the years.</LD>
<LD>   The eagle even once claimed its own column, in which, in 1910, it
remarked on the growing population of neighborhoods that have since
gone away, and others that remain: "the Italian and Russian quarters
and Sonoratown ... West Adams, Chester Place and the Westlake
district." The eagle wondered how many Iowans were here: "I do not
know exactly how many ... but they are a-plenty." (Los Angeles wasn't
called Iowa-by-the-sea for nothing.) The eagle said it also didn't
know how many real estate agents were in town, but decided there were
too many of those too. Well, at least some things don't change.</LD>
<TE>   Just like The Times itself, the eagle's look over the years has
evolved and been streamlined. The emblem once also included a shield,
representing defense of the spirit, and an acorn, a symbol of life
and independence. Over the years it has retained its two essential
elements: a quill pen for writers and journalism and a sword for
liberty and justice.</TE>
<TE>   The new version of the Times eagle looks more alert, a good thing,
we think, for an editorial page. The eagle continues to look
vigilantly out to the right. (Or is it the left? ... depends on the
issue.) We hope you find the eagle the symbol of a page that
continues a tradition of courage and strength and, not least,
clearheaded persuasion.</TE>

<LD>Bedraggled men bedding down on church steps for the night. A family
shuttling between emergency shelters and short-term rentals. Addicts
on Los Angeles' skid row. A couple with two children and stable jobs
struggling to get out of a cramped rental into a home they can own.</LD>
<LD>   These are the varied faces of Californians who could be helped by
Proposition 46, a $2.6-billion bond measure on the Nov. 5 ballot that
would spur a few new remedies to the shortage of housing in the
state, especially for people who are poor or destitute.</LD>
<LD>   Proposition 46 is not perfect. The measure is fuzzy about who gets
funds: The disabled, "struggling families with no place to go" and
farm workers get money. So do teachers in need of a down payment,
state universities that want to build more dorms and first-time
buyers of homes under 175% of the median sales price in a region.</LD>
<TE>   All of this is nice, and some of it would indirectly ease the
strain on people who are really at risk of living on the streets or
in a temporary shelter. But more money should have been earmarked for
the very poor and the mentally ill and addicted people who routinely
sleep on sidewalks and under bridges, most of whom need more help
than the offer of a cheap apartment.</TE>
<TE>   As Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca puts it, counties will have
to move quickly to get money for their poor, before it's snapped up
by better-organized groups that build suburban-style homes.</TE>
<TE>   California's respected Little Hoover Commission found that more
than two-thirds of the poor spend more than half of their already
slim incomes on housing, putting them at risk of losing their homes
in a fiscal emergency.</TE>
<TE>   Too many of the needy end up on the streets, either full time or
part time. By voting yes on Proposition 46, Californians can begin
relaxing that squeeze.</TE>

<HD>Vote No on Secession</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Nov. 5 ballot describes San Fernando Valley secession (Measure F)
and Hollywood secession (Measure H) as a "special reorganization,"
government lingo that makes breaking up the nation's second-largest
city sound as simple as rearranging a closet. It's not.</LD>
<LD>   Breaking apart a city the size of Los Angeles would be an
extraordinarily complex undertaking. It would not guarantee delivery
of the sky-high promises made by secession leaders, whose top-choice
name for a new Valley city is Camelot. It would be a drastic "fix"
for a world-famous city.</LD>
<LD>   No one between now and the election is going to convince die-hard
secession advocates to vote against a breakup. But for residents on
either side of Mulholland Drive who have not yet made up their minds,
we recommend keeping Los Angeles united by voting no on secession.</LD>
<TE>   Secession's Uncertainties</TE>
<TE>   Passage of F and H would not mean a clean break. The measures call
for Los Angeles to provide police protection and all other services
for at least the first year. After that, new Valley and Hollywood
cities could continue renting services from Los Angeles, contract
with the county or develop and staff their own departments.</TE>
<TE>   If it seems like a lot of trouble to secede from Los Angeles only
to continue using the same services or rent them from the even
larger, financially strapped county, it is. Starting a small city
from scratch is hard work, and starting a Valley city with an instant
population of 1.4 million people -- all of whom would need their
garbage collected, their streets tended and their houses protected
from fire -- is unprecedented. Developing city services could take
years.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to paying for the services they receive, the new
cities would pay so-called alimony for 20 years to make up for lost
tax revenues. Los Angeles officials claim that the payments aren't
enough. Some Valley residents grumble that they shouldn't have to pay
anything. That matter, along with water rights disputes, would end up
in court.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood secession apparently has little support inside or
outside Hollywood. Valley secession is more complicated. Because of
its roots in the anti-tax and anti-busing movements of the 1970s,
secession is seen by some as white flight. But just as the rest of
Los Angeles has changed, today's Valley is not the white enclave it
was 30 or 40 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   An Unlikely Camelot</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who has shopped for lavash bread, plantains and taro root
at Reseda's Valley Produce or driven the length of Sherman Way knows
that multilingual advertisements can now be seen on Valley streets.
New immigrants and poorer communities have, in fact, taken up many of
the old-line secessionists' complaints about inadequate services, a
distant downtown government and citywide disrespect.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you tired of unsafe streets?" the secession campaign's Web
site asks. "Traffic? Gangs? Blight? A declining quality of life? Are
you tired of bad schools?"</TE>
<TE>   Who isn't? But breaking up the city would not change the school
district, which is governed separately from the city. Breaking away
from Los Angeles isn't going to wall off the Valley from the growth
and demographic changes that have both energized and unsettled
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The Case for Unity</TE>
<TE>   The Valley has long complained that it falls short on respect. But
if clout equals respect, the Valley has plenty. The addition of a
fifth City Council seat in the Valley gives it the largest voting
bloc of any area in the city. That's clout. Angelenos may not be the
type to carry on about civic values or hype a government that
everyone knows has faults. But the Valley and Hollywood are both
integral to Los Angeles' identity.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley is the middle-class heart of a city increasingly split
between the rich and poor. Hollywood is the personification of the
city of dreams.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, Los Angeles has problems; what city this large and diverse
doesn't? But size and variety also are part of its energy and endless
possibilities. Angelenos, don't give up on the dream. Vote no on
secession, Propositions F and H.</TE>

<LD>Re "Ports Get Back to Business," Oct. 10: The report from a trucker
at the docks that he hadn't "made a penny for 10 days" pales in
comparison with my family's loss due to this strike. We have an
orange grove in Ojai. The crop was picked just days before the
walkout, so we have the expenses of growing the fruit, picking and
packing it. It is not delivered, so we are not paid for a year's
labor and expense. Not just 10 days but a year with no return!</LD>

<TE>   Let me see if I can add up these numbers. The workers were locked
out by the shippers because of a work slowdown that made it cheaper
to let a couple of hundred ships wait to be unloaded over a 10-day
period (and brought on a financial disaster for this country,
businesses and who knows who else).</TE>
<TE>   Now, everyone says that it will take six to eight weeks just to
clear out the backlog of containers. Wouldn't it have been better to
have had some "slow" work (never mind safety or those who have died)
than to have the disaster that the complete shutdown has brought?</TE>

<LD>California has attempted to control its pollution for 20 years with
rules and regulations more strict than those adopted nationally. The
Republicans now side with the auto manufacturers (Oct. 10) in
claiming that California's attempts to cleanse itself are illegal
because they go further than those adopted by the federal government.
Whatever happened to that good old Republican philosophy of states'
rights? When their "philosophy" interferes with their business ties
or political base, as with the state-adopted initiatives in Oregon on
the right to die or in California on medical marijuana, the
Republicans' hypocrisy becomes obvious.</LD>

<LD>Re "Congress Backs War on Iraq," Oct. 11: The congressional backing
of the resolution giving this president, or any president, the broad
power to attack Iraq under the circumstances as presented in
President Bush's own recent speech is a potential error of the first
magnitude -- even if it is, as some claim, simply an attempt to
extract the fullest leverage from other diplomatic initiatives.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, if this were Hollywood circa 1977 and the initial "Star
Wars" trilogy were being developed, it is lamentably clear that the
United States would be cast as the Empire and represented by the
persona of Darth Vader.</LD>

<TE>   Re "CIA Feels Heat on Iraq Data," Oct. 11: When will the citizens
catch on that the president is creating the need for a war? He and
his advisors want the CIA to create data to support his point of view
for war, when most data now suggest there is no reason to rush to
battle. Apparently, he thinks we voters are that simple that we will
believe all that he says.</TE>
<TE>   After listening to Congress, it appears he could be right. Did you
ever wonder why he has pushed this war with such passion and fervor?
As an American and a voter, I am frightened.</TE>

<TE>   I didn't vote for Bush and have no plans to do so in 2004, but if
it comes to believing Bush over Saddam Hussein, I go with my American
president. If we invade Iraq and Bush is wrong about Hussein having
chemicals of mass destruction, then the result will be a few thousand
dead Iraqis. If we invade Iraq and Bush was right about Hussein, we
saved America and our allies from a fate that would make Sept. 11
look like a picnic in the park. And there'll still be thousands of
dead Iraqis. I am not going to shed any tears for dead Iraqi
civilians.</TE>

spoken to the staff in Sherman's and Waxman's offices and both

Nations force led by the United States forced him out in 1991. That
war has been fought, appeasement is not on the table, the analogy
with 1938 is not valid. World War II was won by an international
coalition, not by the United States alone. That is a better analogy.</TE>

<HD>Annenberg Made His Mark on American Life</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like many others, I've admired Walter Annenberg a lot over the years
-- not just for what he did but for how he went about it (obituary,
Oct. 2). One Sunday night in 1996, I was folding the laundry when the
phone rang. I picked it up to hear his impressive voice. He was
interested in investing in the renovation of Independence Mall, a
project the Pew Trusts had just announced. I gave him a brief
explanation of the importance of the plans for a new home for the
Liberty Bell and other enhancements to the nation's most historic
square mile, and of the economic stimulus it could provide to the
Philadelphia region.</LD>
<LD>   He asked incisive, thoughtful questions -- he was bringing his
results-oriented business savvy to bear on philanthropy. After
completing his appropriate due diligence, he was quick to move, and
the next day his foundation was a major partner.</LD>
<LD>   The ambassador afforded me a front-row lesson in sophisticated
philanthropy and strategic thinking. We will all miss that energy,
vision, commitment and profound sense of obligation to this great
nation. No one felt more strongly that of those to whom much is
given, much is expected. He gave to education reform, scholarship
funds, universities and cultural institutions -- the list goes on. He
also gave to his country through public service.</LD>
<TE>   Most Americans will probably know Walter Annenberg, like Andrew
Carnegie, more for the results of his philanthropy than for his
remarkable business acumen. They have become a permanent part of
American life. We are a better nation because of Annenberg's inspired
and exceptional gifts.</TE>

<LD>Re "A Clouded View of U.S. Jews," Oct. 9: It is not surprising that
two studies of the same subject produced such widely different
results. One study showed the Jewish population in the U.S. declined
in the past decade while another showed a rather healthy increase. It
brings to mind the old Jewish joke: "If you have two Jews in a room
you have three opinions." Jews still represent about 2% of the U.S.
population regardless of the specific results of different studies.</LD>

<HD>Under CEO Eisner, Disney Has Thrived</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Failing Magic at Disney" (editorial, Sept. 29) was highly critical
of Michael Eisner's stewardship of Walt Disney Co. Beginning in 1984,
Eisner took a historic enterprise, which had grown moribund, and gave
it a new, energized, creative zest that so ignited the company that
it rode an ascending curve of fiscal and creative success over the
years. How successful? The stock has increased roughly 1,200% since
1984. Would any stockholder object to this kind of increase?</LD>
<LD>   I count Eisner to be in the very top tier of chief executives. I
know, because I have observed them all with an intimate scrutiny.
Your editorial cited the fall of the price of Disney stock and
endorsed Eisner identifying a successor. Has not the Dow collapsed,
which means that falling stock prices are a malady that has infected
a majority of the Fortune 500 companies? What could a successor do
that Eisner is not trying to do? Can a successor erase 9/11 and
entice people to patronize theme parks again? Is it Eisner's fault
that families are not traveling as much with their children since
9/11?</LD>
<TE>   There is no magic formula that springs like Athena, full-blown,
from the forehead of Zeus. None. If there were, then countless
corporations would celebrate the rise of their stock prices and a
resurgence of earnings. It is not as if Disney broods in resplendent
isolation when the rest of the business community glows with fiscal
triumph.</TE>
<TE>   Eisner doesn't need my endorsement; his record in his Disney
leadership tenure matches the best of the best in achievement through
the years.</TE>

<TE>   Eisner has the best interests of Southern Californians at heart.
Your editorial ignored the community contributions that Eisner has
made, through Cal State Northridge and Project GRAD Los Angeles, to
the children and families of the northeast San Fernando Valley. For
many years, Eisner has walked door-to-door in Pacoima -- a
neighborhood not a media magnet -- to recruit Latino youth for our
college scholarship program. The oldest among these children are now
seniors at San Fernando High School and will be enrolling in college
next fall. He has supported our organization through our good times
and bad. We would encourage Southern Californians to do the same for
Eisner and Disney.</TE>

<HD>Echoes of the Bad Old Days Threaten Promise of Peace</HD>
<DH>Extremists among both nationalists and unionists are doing
their best to destroy a fragile sense of trust.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kelly Candaele</AU>
<BD>Kelly Candaele is a contributing writer for Irish
America magazine and has written extensively on Northern Ireland.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The pessimists may be right about Northern Ireland. Ever since the
Irish Republican Army announced a cease-fire in 1994, which gave
momentum to peace, skeptics have predicted that, some day, the whole
jury-rigged edifice of peacemaking would come tumbling down because
the IRA wouldn't stay on a democratic path.</LD>
<LD>   These days, unionists in Northern Ireland, U.S. officials and
British Prime Minister Tony Blair are all feeling stung by the IRA
and its political arm, Sinn Fein. They fear that the underlying
dynamics of Northern Ireland have changed for the worse since the
signing of the Good Friday peace agreement in 1998, which set up the
power-sharing government of nationalists, who are mostly Catholic,
and the mainly Protestant unionists who want to remain part of
Britain.</LD>
<LD>   If Sinn Fein and the IRA are still committed to the peace process,
as Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams says, they need to explain their
recent actions, which seem designed to give opponents of the
agreement good reason to suspect that while Adams talks peace, the
IRA still prepares for war.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier this month, police raided Sinn Fein offices at Stormont,
the seat of the Northern Irish Assembly, and later arrested four Sinn
Fein supporters on charges of stealing sensitive British government
and security documents, which included the names and addresses of
Northern Irish police officers and prison officials, and passing them
on to the IRA. Elsewhere, three men associated with Sinn Fein and the
IRA went on trial in Colombia for allegedly helping the FARC, the
country's largest guerrilla force, upgrade its bomb-making and
weapons capability. And to make matters worse, a book published last
week by a respected Irish journalist alleges that Adams knew about
and sanctioned the murder of suspected informers, including a
Catholic mother of 10, during his years as a member of the Belfast
IRA.</TE>
<TE>   The Good Friday accord was supposed to promote trust by requiring
nationalists and unionists to work together to solve daily problems.
But extremists in both communities have done their best to remind
people that the bad old days are not securely in the past. Loyalist
violence in Catholic enclaves in Belfast continues apace, and the IRA
seems incapable of shedding its self-destructive and threatening
behavior.</TE>
<TE>   David Trimble, leader of the Protestant Ulster Unionist Party and
first minister of the Northern Irish Assembly, has called upon Blair
to expel Sinn Fein's two representatives on the power-sharing
executive, effectively ending the political experiment. Trimble's
bitterly divided party has told him that the disbanding of the IRA is
its price for staying in the government, and he has, so far,
acquiesced to save his political skin. Still, Trimble's career may
soon be over, and an anti-agreement unionist may replace him as party
head.</TE>
<TE>   Distrust remains at the heart of the new tensions. Nationalists
continue to believe that unionists don't want to share power with
them; they think that the authorities are indifferent to the
increasing violence against them; and they resent what they see as
British pandering to unionist political whims. Nevertheless, the IRA
has not gone back to war and has, in fact, destroyed two caches of
weapons. Furthermore, when the British government bugged the offices
and car of Adams and Sinn Fein negotiator Martin McGuinness during
peace negotiations in 1995, they didn't walk away from the talks.</TE>
<TE>   Adams will go down in history as one of the great leaders of Irish
nationalism, the person primarily responsible for creating a path
away from the senseless war of attrition that characterized Northern
Ireland for 25 years. But, as one commentator recently noted, he may
be a Moses able to lead his people to the promised land but unable to
cross the Jordan River.</TE>
<TE>   Adams, like Moses, needs help from powerful places. When tensions
first threatened to upset the Good Friday agreement, President
Clinton provided critical outside pressure when it was needed. Three
times he traveled to Northern Ireland to bolster the chances for
peace. His relationship with Adams enhanced Sinn Fein's international
stature, which helped give it political standing. Even though most of
the "hard men" of the IRA have followed Adam's lead, a culture of
violence and distrust maintains a strong hold on IRA volunteers. Many
retain a dangerous belief that the only language the British
understand is the language of force.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, it's hard to overstate the progress Northern Ireland has
made. In 1972, there were 10,000 shootings and 500 deaths
attributable to the "Troubles." Last year, there were four deaths
related to political strife. Ironically, that success may be one
reason why Northern Ireland is not on President Bush's foreign policy
radar.</TE>
<TE>   After the Good Friday agreement was signed, there was widespread
hope that the Northern Irish experiment would be a model for
resolving intractable disputes. The Spanish looked for lessons they
could apply to Basque separatists. Palestinian and Israeli academics
and representatives arrived to study the peace process and to talk to
people on the ground. Now, with the suspension of the Northern Irish
government a distinct possibility, that experiment may be just
another tragic chapter in Irish history.</TE>

<BD>Michael Cieply, a Los Angeles journalist, writes
frequently about the film industry.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some weeks ago, about 80 fretful parents gathered at an exclusive Los
Angeles prep school to hear a Yale University admissions officer
tell, among other things, what he looks for in the all-important
personal statement that accompanies most college applications.</LD>
<LD>   Winning essays, said the officer, often described the plight of
disrupted families. The struggles of migrant workers, for instance,
had scored big in the admissions process. So had the woes wrought by
an alcoholic or drug-addicted parent. Indeed, a favorite statement
told of a girl who earned straight A's, even though both mother and
father had AIDS. "I don't know how she did it. I was in tears when I
read it," the Yale man said.</LD>
<LD>   Finally, one listener had the temerity to ask a question shared by
many in the audience: "What about kids without trauma in their
lives?"</LD>
<TE>   The not entirely reassuring answer: "There's room for kids like
that too."</TE>
<TE>   College application season is here, and it promises to be one of
the saddest on record, given a growing tendency by some of the best
schools to allot prized slots, at least in part, to students who have
met and conquered great adversity.</TE>
<TE>   Late last year, the University of California instituted a
"comprehensive review" process under which applicants get extra
points for overcoming handicaps like parental divorce, a ghetto
upbringing or debilitating illness. The system is meant to help the
disadvantaged without violating a voter-mandated ban on race-based
selection. In effect, it simply formalizes a good-hearted impulse
shared by Yale and other Ivy League schools, where the ability to
make your bleary-eyed application reader weep has already become a
powerful factor in the admissions game.</TE>
<TE>   Inevitably, such policies have sent a shiver through better-heeled
applicants who can't always find a sad story to tell. "There's
confusion among students who have not had a huge crisis in life,"
said a dean at one relatively prosperous Westside public high school,
who asked that neither she nor her school be identified. "They say,
'What do I write about?' Sharing your family moments of crisis may
become a crisis when they don't have that moment."</TE>
<TE>   You have to wonder whether college essays will begin to resemble
the composition by the rich kid in the old joke who was asked to
write a story about poverty. It began: "Once there was a very poor
family. The mother was poor. The father was poor. The kids were poor.
Even the maid and butler were poor."</TE>
<TE>   A private school mother I know tells of a Chinese student who is
despondent because his parents, having long ago fled communist
oppression, have been too successful to do him any good on a personal
statement. The worried mother of another preppy, on hearing that my
15-year-old son was in a presumably more adversity-rich public
school, actually said: "Then you're lucky. You'll do OK."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Shaw, Yale's dean of undergraduate admissions and
financial aid, said any such panic of the privileged reflects a
fundamental misreading of policies at his school and most others.
"It's much bigger than that," Shaw said when told of parental
concerns about his admissions officer's L.A. speech. "We look at kids
who are precocious in playing the violin, at leaders in forensics and
so on."</TE>
<TE>   In any case, students at premier Los Angeles academies like
Harvard-Westlake School or Marlborough School will surely continue to
reap powerful advantage from superior instruction, small class size
and, above all, from deep-running liaisons between their college
counselors and the admissions staff at trophy universities--Harvard,
Yale, Princeton and such--for which they've long been "feeders." This
year's must-read book for the college-bound, "The Gatekeepers: Inside
the Admissions Process of a Premier College" by New York Times
reporter Jacques Steinberg, describes in fascinating detail how key
prep-school advisors can pick up the phone to call old friends and
bend the admissions process in favor of proteges at a school as
prestigious as Wesleyan University, of which he made a case study.</TE>
<TE>   And yet there is something unnerving about a system that would try
to level the field by encouraging our young to make an asset of their
woes. Do we really want university admissions to become the stuff of
an "Oprah" show?</TE>
<TE>   According to the above-mentioned public school dean, many
students--with a dignity not yet snuffed by the culture of
victimhood--are reluctant to share intimate stories of family
trouble, even when it would clearly help them on an application to UC
Berkeley or UCLA. "Is this something you really want to tell?" she
asks, before they advertise personal problems that, once committed to
an essay, can't be called back.</TE>
<TE>   Having known at least a bit of adversity, I can empathize. When I
was young, my father, now deceased, bankrupted a small business in a
way that clearly broke his heart. He suffered serious depressions,
unable to get out of bed. For a time he did assembly-line work in
Detroit, but then he was injured, leading, among other things, to a
long, miserable stint on government food handouts for his family of
seven.</TE>
<TE>   By the time I went to the University of Michigan, my father was
back at work, as was my mother, and the two of them never missed a
payment on a decent suburban home that kept five kids quite happy
until they were launched, every one, to a four-year college.</TE>
<TE>   Perfect grist for a personal statement. But to have to put one
word of that in a school application would have horrified me. The
troubles, and we had many, were private to us. What the admissions
people needed to know was that I had excelled at my little parochial
high school.</TE>
<TE>   Hardship, it always seemed to me, had conferred advantages that
more than compensated for the better education and more worldly
background of the students around me. I was somewhat tougher and more
focused than most, because I deeply needed an education that they
merely wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Something in that experience tells me that our drift toward
sob-story admissions is a mistake -- that it demeans the very people
it's meant to help. (And my subsequent work as a reporter raises no
small suspicion that some of the best stories on those applications
won't be true, anyway.)</TE>
<TE>   It's probably too much to hope that our finest colleges will ever
find an admissions process that selects only for what we do, not who
we are. The system will always be biased toward privilege, and some
mechanism to correct for that bias is in order.</TE>
<TE>   But we can surely do better than to reward those who tell the
saddest tale.</TE>

<HD>Oil Economics Lubricates Push for War</HD>
<DH>The U.S. may be smacking its lips over the financial
benefits expected from a regime change, but the price could be
enormous.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas Ferguson and Robert A. Johnson</AU>
<BD>Thomas Ferguson is professor of political science at
the University of Massachusetts, Boston; Robert A. Johnson is former
managing director of Soros Funds Management and served previously as
chief economist of the Senate Banking Committee.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BOSTON -- Critics of an American preemptive assault on Iraq have
repeatedly warned about its potentially disruptive short-term effects
on the world economy. Much less attention has been paid to a more
fundamental point. By setting a goal of "regime change" rather than
weapons elimination, and by ostentatiously preparing to assume
operational and oversight responsibilities in Iraq for a long stretch
of time, the U.S. is sending a strong message to treasuries and
foreign ministries around the world. In matters affecting either oil
supply or the value of the dollar, we will act in our best interests,
with little consideration of the interests or views of others.</LD>
<LD>   A glance backward is the easiest way to see why oil and the dollar
inevitably loom so large in any resolution of the Iraq crisis. The
current configuration of the Middle East has its roots in treaties
and understandings that grew out of the post-World War I settlement
of the broken Ottoman Empire. That settlement was based on an
assumption that the Russian Revolution had removed both Russia and
Central Asia from the world oil market. Everything changed, though,
in 1989, when the Soviet Union began to disintegrate and Russia and
Central Asia came charging dramatically back into world oil markets.</LD>
<TE>   With both the U.S. and the U.K. ardently promoting globalization,
a traditional "spheres of influence" redivision of the world among
the great powers did not occur. Instead companies and countries from
all over the world started playing the new "great game" in Central
Asia.</TE>
<TE>   The blustering efforts of the Saudis to inhibit the flow of
Russian oil to the West have received some recent publicity. These
actions have caused tensions with the West, as have Saudi campaigns
during the '90s to expand the influence of their austere brand of
Islamic fundamentalism throughout Central Asia, including
Afghanistan, and their ongoing rapprochement with Iran.</TE>
<TE>   Then came Sept. 11, which brought into even sharper focus the
points at which Saudi and American interests diverge. Since then, the
Bush administration has expanded efforts to weaken OPEC's grip on
supply by developing oil resources in other parts of the world. Its
cultivation of President Vladimir V. Putin and his Russian oil has
drawn the most attention, but its policies toward Africa, Indonesia
and South America also show clear evidence of this concern.</TE>
<TE>   An American-led regime change in Iraq would take this campaign to
a whole new level. It is now an accepted notion that lifting the
current sanctions on Iraqi oil exports will put downward pressure on
oil prices in the medium term. More important, however, Russian and
most non-OPEC oil is relatively expensive to produce -- $15 a barrel
or more. By contrast, Iraqi production costs, once damage from the
war is repaired, should be highly competitive with Saudi oil: $5 a
barrel or less.</TE>
<TE>   This makes Iraq pivotal for stabilizing oil prices in both
directions. If prices rise too high, Iraq can simply pump more. Less
obviously, however, if the Saudis decide, as they have twice done in
recent years, to wage a ruinous price war, lowering prices sharply in
order to deter other cartel members from overproducing, then Iraq's
role is again key. With another low-cost gas station open for
business, the Saudis cannot count on maintaining total revenues as
prices fall, because now they will have to split the take with the
Iraqis. This downward price deterrence will be welcome news to
marginal producers around the world, including those in Texas, and it
is very important in assessing the long-run impact of the American
move.</TE>
<TE>   The currency implications of such a switch are equally momentous.
The tremendous boom in U.S. stock markets in the '90s led to enormous
inflows of foreign capital and sent demand for dollars soaring. In
effect, the stock market bubble created a dollar bubble. With the
stock market now coming back to Earth and American interest rates
falling almost as low as those in Japan, only the prospect of even
lower growth in Europe and Asia now sustains the dollar. In financial
markets, the dollar's sharp decline earlier this year is widely
regarded as a harbinger of things to come.</TE>
<TE>   A major prop for the dollar has long been the simple fact that oil
is priced in U.S. dollars. If the new Iraqi petroleum authorities
announce that they will accept checks only in dollars, invest their
surplus in dollars, and swell U.S. exports by contracting principally
with American firms for services and goods, the dollar's prospects
will brighten. As pleased as Europeans have been to seize chances to
export under the umbrella of a high dollar, this will not be what
they had in mind when they called in recent months for action to
break the dollar's fall: Nascent ventures to create an oil futures
market in euros may well be stillborn, while prospects will diminish
for a long-term rebalancing of asset portfolios away from the dollar
and in favor of the Euro.</TE>
<TE>   From a distant mountaintop like Capitol Hill, all this may seem
like a vision of the promised land. In reality it is a desert mirage.
The dollar cannot thrive in isolation. The need for effective
multilateral action to shore up the world economy is growing urgent.
We need macro policies to stimulate demand and stabilize the foreign
exchange values of the major currencies.</TE>
<TE>   The economic situation is frighteningly precarious in Latin
America, where Argentina, Brazil and even Mexico have recently
suffered currency runs. In Africa, efforts to provide resources for
public health, treatment of HIV/AIDS and social infrastructure are in
conflict with debt burdens that are strangling the capacity of the
public sector to respond to the challenges. In an atmosphere poisoned
by U.S. go-it-alone tactics in oil and financial markets, resolving
issues of debt relief and rescheduling and international banking
coordination will surely become more difficult. The current discord
between Germany and the U.S. poses a special obstacle, because
Germany remains a financial powerhouse, whatever its military
weakness.</TE>
<TE>   All this takes no account of what may go wrong within Iraq itself
or in the rest of the Middle East after Iraq is liberated. As they
did after World War I, tensions between the U.S. and its major allies
may well inflame ethnic rivalries that will run rife in whatever
political structure emerges in the new Iraq. In the worst case, a
likely casualty of a unilateral U.S. attack on Iraq may well be the
system of alliances that the U.S. has maintained since World War II.
Going it alone in defense, as the new Bush doctrine proclaims, is bad
enough. Going it alone on oil and the dollar is a momentous error.</TE>

<BD>Jack Miles, author of "Christ: A Crisis in the Life of
God," was recently named a MacArthur Fellow.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the march to war in Iraq, President Bush enjoys, for the moment,
widespread popular support at home. He is, as the saying goes, the
only president we have, and he has won the qualified backing of
Congress. But sometimes the war debates that matter most in the long
run are not those conducted on Capitol Hill.</LD>
<LD>   A surprisingly early statement against the war by the U.S.
Conference of Catholic Bishops suggests that if the president's Iraqi
gamble goes badly -- and particularly if its consequences prove
catastrophic for Iraq without decisively improving security in the
United States -- the current wide support may erode rapidly.</LD>
<LD>   The bishops' early statement surprises because Catholic opposition
to the Vietnam War came so late. For American Catholics, rather more
than for American Protestants, the Cold War had always been a holy
war, because so many Catholics were trapped behind the Iron Curtain
in places like Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia and western Ukraine.</LD>
<TE>   South Vietnam, the most Catholic part of Asia after the
Philippines, fell into what seemed a cruel and familiar pattern:
godless communism directing its worst fury at devout Catholics. By
the late '60s, to be sure, there was an active Catholic peace
movement. By the end of the war, Catholic conscientious objectors
outnumbered all others. But that change came slowly. Through the
early escalations of the war, Catholics remained its stoutest
supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Even now, the Roman Catholic Church is not pacifist. It adheres,
generally, to its classic teaching allowing "just war." Nonetheless,
Bishop Wilton D. Gregory, president of the U.S. bishops' conference,
writing Sept. 13 to Bush on behalf of the bishops' administrative
committee, expressed grave doubts that an American invasion of Iraq
could meet the just-war criteria and urged the president to "step
back from the brink of war."</TE>
<TE>   Gregory wrote that war can only be justly waged in "cases in which
the damage inflicted by the aggressor on the nation or community of
nations is lasting, grave and certain." But he questioned whether
Iraq is in a position to inflict lasting, grave and certain damage on
the United States. "Is there clear and adequate evidence," Gregory
asked, "of a direct connection between Iraq and the attacks of Sept.
11, or clear and adequate evidence of an imminent attack of a grave
nature? ... Is it wise to dramatically expand traditional moral and
legal limits on just cause to include preventive or preemptive uses
of military force to overthrow threatening regimes or to deal with
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction? Should not a
distinction be made between efforts to change unacceptable behavior
of a government and efforts to end that government's existence?"</TE>
<TE>   One of the key tenets of just-war theory is probability of
success. The loss of innocent life in war cannot be justified if,
after victory, the status quo ante is quite likely to remain
unchanged. But will Al Qaeda not remain a threat after victory in
Iraq, just as it has remained a threat after victory in Afghanistan?</TE>
<TE>   Gregory asked, "Would ... force succeed in thwarting serious
threats, or, instead, provoke the very kind of attacks that it is
intended to prevent?"</TE>
<TE>   As if anticipating the objection that Al Qaeda would at least be a
somewhat smaller threat after victory in Iraq, Gregory invoked
another tenet of just-war theory -- namely, proportionality: One does
not settle a trade dispute, say, by bombing the adversary's capital.
As a Catholic catechism cited by Gregory put it, the use of force
"must not produce evils and disorders graver than the evil to be
eliminated." Can mass casualties in Iraq be justified in the
interests of bringing about nothing more than a reduction of
unknowable size in the terrorist threat to the United States?</TE>
<TE>   The subject of Iraqi civilian casualties is one about which the
American political silence has been striking, but then this is just
the kind of question that, by an unwritten, unofficial American
division of powers, has often been left to religious leaders.
Accepting this role, Gregory asked: "How would another war in Iraq
impact the civilian population, in the short and long term? How many
more innocent people would suffer and die, or be left without homes,
without basic necessities, without work? Would the United States and
the international community commit to the arduous, long-term task of
ensuring a just peace, or would a post-Saddam Iraq continue to be
plagued by civil conflict and repression and continue to serve as a
destabilizing force in the region?"</TE>
<TE>   What Gregory implies -- in the diplomatic language suitable for a
letter to the president -- is that mass casualties in an avoidable
war are tantamount to mass murder. If the United States commits such
a crime, or if by ill-considered action its intervention becomes the
occasion for such a loss, he politely suggests, the nation will be
morally disgraced. In Washington, even among the political
opposition, this ranks low on the list of policy considerations. But
if the moral core of a great national debate is located outside the
usual political forums, it will scarcely be for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq seems targeted to become a second Afghanistan, a second front
in America's war on terror, but Gregory dares to ask about the
consequences of war in Iraq for the first front. "Would war against
Iraq," Gregory wrote, "detract from our responsibility to help build
a just and stable order in Afghanistan and undermine the broader
coalition against terrorism?" For the United States, the bishop
suggests, Afghanistan may have been a charity case before the
American military descended on it from the sky, but Afghanistan is an
American responsibility now.</TE>
<TE>   Gregory and his brother bishops, to repeat, are not pacifists. As
the spiritual leaders of one American in five, they do not rule out
all wars in advance on moral grounds. But wars, like all other human
actions -- perhaps more than any other -- merit moral scrutiny. Some
wars are just, and some are unjust. What the Catholic bishops have to
say on the distinction between the two, rising to an occasion that
has come so often before in American life, is no less important than
anything they have lately had to say about child abuse.</TE>

<LD>PORTLAND, Maine -- Jeffrey Garten, dean of the Yale School of
Management, recently remarked that defeating terrorism would require
"Washington and corporate America to work more closely together than
ever before." While such an alliance is bound to emerge, especially
now that war against Iraq seems inevitable, corporate America might
not be all that eager to share the rhetorical foxhole that the White
House has been digging of late.</LD>
<LD>   The uneasiness of business leaders stems from more than their
customary anxiety about the unpredictable effects of war or from
their concern that an administration preoccupied with foreign affairs
might give the domestic economy short shrift. Rather, what may most
trouble a corporate America that is more multinational than ever is
the threat the administration's unilateral approach to foreign
relations poses to the future of global economic integration.</LD>
<TE>   Eighty years ago, President Calvin Coolidge proclaimed that the
business of America is business. Today, a substantial share of that
business involves foreign companies as customers, suppliers,
investors and partners in developing, producing and marketing goods
and services. The full extent to which the U.S. economy has become
enmeshed in the global economy is hard to comprehend because the
relevant numbers are so large. For example, the value of U.S. exports
of goods and services has reached the $1-trillion mark, roughly 10
times the size of California's current budget.</TE>
<TE>   Consider that the value of these exports pales in comparison with
the amount of business U.S. companies do through their subsidiaries
abroad. In 1999, the latest year for which numbers are available,
these overseas affiliates had revenues of $2.2 trillion. Equally
remarkable, the volume of trade among the foreign affiliates totaled
$451.9 billion, an amount approximately equal to the combined annual
economic output of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino
counties.</TE>
<TE>   The commercial activity of U.S. affiliates overseas is matched by
that of foreign-owned subsidiaries operating within the United
States. According to the latest government figures, the gross product
of these firms amounted to $522 billion in 2000, or 5.3% of America's
gross domestic product.</TE>
<TE>   Even these figures don't fully capture just how internationalized
the U.S. economy has become. Progress in transportation and
communications technologies has eroded the barrier of distance to the
point that global supply chains have emerged. These chains enable the
production of virtually any product to be divided into separate tasks
for completion wherever the work can be done most efficiently and
economically.</TE>
<TE>   In short, the stereotype of global trade as finished goods moving
across international borders is obsolete. Today, such trade largely
consists of raw materials, parts, components and semi-finished goods
moving through global supply chains. The products we eat, wear, drive
or otherwise use are likely to have pedigrees as complicated as the
ancestral roots of most Americans. The economic dislocations caused
by labor strife at Pacific Coast seaports testify to this new
reality.</TE>
<TE>   These developments also mean that the U.S. economy has become
increasingly vulnerable to disruption at points too numerous to
defend. In the wake of Sept. 11, U.S. corporations reviewed their
foreign operations as well as their dependence on international
transportation systems. Some observers predicted that the companies
would retrench to safer ground or at least relocate vital operations
to North America.</TE>
<TE>   The opposite has occurred. Most U.S. multinationals have continued
to pursue their pre-Sept. 11 business strategies despite the added
risks. For example, Boeing plans to shift a greater share of its
aircraft design, engineering and production work to countries such as
Russia and China. Intel will expand some chip-design and
chip-development operations in India. And PeopleSoft will
substantially augment its software operations in Malaysia.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. multinational corporations are not courting disaster. They
have a keen appreciation of the dangers they face overseas and have
accordingly devised methods for managing the risks. But there is
mounting concern that President Bush's campaign to oust Iraq's Saddam
Hussein could set off a spiral of terrorist attacks and military
countermeasures that could seriously affect their businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond this lies the more far-reaching question of whether U.S.
economic interests in the age of globalization are served by the
administration's harsh brand of unilateralism. True, the president
has reached out to other nations in his quest to disarm Iraq. But for
the most part, his seemingly instinctive disdain for constructive
engagement with other countries on anything but his own terms has
become a hallmark of his administration.</TE>
<TE>   Such an approach hardly promotes U.S. commercial interests
worldwide through free trade agreements and greater global economic
integration. If there is one administration official who may feel
conflicted about his boss' generally dismissive attitude toward
foreign opinion, it is Robert B. Zoellick, the U.S. trade
representative. Zoellick has the unenviable task of negotiating trade
agreements with nations in Europe, Latin America and Asia whose
relations with the United States have soured since Bush took office.
As recent electoral outcomes in Germany and Brazil suggest, running
against U.S. policies can be politically rewarding. It's not a
stretch to argue that major trade talks may be similarly hurt by the
administration's unilateralism.</TE>
<TE>   At home, the administration's take-it-or-leave-it posture toward
foreigners regrettably nourishes the xenophobic, isolationist impulse
that has long haunted U.S. politics and hamstrung American foreign
policy. Yet, what is singularly perverse about the administration's
unilateralist rhetoric is that it presents foes of globalization with
a strong populist rationale for resisting further entanglements,
economic or otherwise, with other nations. The irony is that an
ostensibly business-friendly Republican administration may turn out
to be a thorn in corporate America's side.</TE>

A Political History of the American Rich."</BD>

<LD>WASHINGTON -- President Bush's assertion Monday night that Saddam
Hussein is as great and immediate a threat to the United States as
the nuclear missiles the Soviet Union put in Cuba 40 years ago means
that the issue should dominate the November elections, despite the
public's apparent desire that more attention be paid to the
staggering economy. This is a tribute to both Republican audacity and
Democratic fecklessness.</LD>
<LD>   With almost a month to go until election day, there remains some
chance that the White House's preoccupation with Saddam Hussein and
its exaggeration of the Iraqi threat could generate a voter backlash.
That would compel a greater pre-election focus on the economy.</LD>
<LD>   The White House preoccupation is unnerving. Forty years ago,
President John F. Kennedy produced aerial photos of newly installed
Russian missiles 90 miles from the United States. Bush can only
discuss how Iraq, some 10,000 miles away, may be trying to use
unmanned aerial vehicles to target the United States. He's not
talking about the former Soviet Union, but a rag-tag country with a
gross national product the size of Kentucky's.</LD>
<TE>   The public understands that something seems amiss, even if
congressional opposition is cowed. Although Americans overwhelmingly
support military action against Iraq, according to a New York
Times/CBS News poll, a majority thinks the president is more
interested in removing Hussein from power than in finding Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction. One unmentioned ingredient: the sense of
a Bush family vendetta left over from the unfinished Persian Gulf
War.</TE>
<TE>   There's also a perception that Bush is insufficiently attentive to
the sliding economy. Before his speech, 69% wanted more discussion of
improving the economy and less preoccupation with Iraq. His talk,
which ignored the domestic economy, seems not to have changed these
attitudes.</TE>
<TE>   So, why the current drift toward war? Partly because of popular
frustration around the first anniversary of Sept. 11, but also
because of the surprising ineffectiveness of congressional Democrats.
Beyond House Democratic leader Richard A. Gephardt's support for the
White House, the reasons for the party's confusion are many.</TE>
<TE>   First, the administration's doctrine of preemptive war is so bold
in a kind of Texas-sheriff way that, despite its legal and moral
dubiousness, it has harnessed support among Americans impatient for
results in the U.S. anti-terrorism war. Besides, important Democratic
constituencies are being tugged by a powerful, new domestic
war-policy axis: an emerging alliance between the religious right,
with its biblical interpretation of Middle East events, and American
Jewish supporters of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, whose
parliamentary coalition in Israel includes that nation's religious
right.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, it's difficult for Democrats to criticize Bush for
using war with Iraq to divert voters' attention from the economy when
Bill Clinton was the president who put "wag the dog" into the U.S.
political lexicon by throwing some cruise missiles at Al Qaeda camps
in Afghanistan and at a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan in August 1998
to distract attention from Monica Lewinsky. It's also tough for
Democrats to speak candidly about U.S. economic weakness -- how the
country is now in the sort of downturn that typically follows the
implosion of a major speculative bubble -- because Clinton was in the
White House as that bubble expanded and popped. Democratic
indictments of Republican economic arguments and upper-bracket
favoritism are correspondingly superficial.</TE>
<TE>   The ultimate Democratic fecklessness stems from the party's
supposed memory of the trouble it got into for questioning former
President Bush's 1990-91 commitment to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi
occupation. What trouble? Democrats made greater gains than expected
in the 1990 congressional elections, added a surprise victory in the
autumn 1991 U.S. Senate special election in Pennsylvania and then
went on to defeat Bush and recapture the presidency in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   The second reality check lost sight of during the last 12 years is
that Hussein is a second-rate, second-priority despot worth taking
out, but only if and when such an effort -- preferably under U.N.
auspices -- doesn't lead to more costs and problems than his
continued existence. Presidents and politicians of both parties have
likened the Iraqi dictator to Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin. But the
latter two only attained their extreme scale of evil by commanding
great military machines. Even the CIA doesn't put Hussein in any
similar league.</TE>
<TE>   Small wonder the public perceives Bush as more concerned about
dethroning Hussein than disarming him. If U.S. involvement with Iraq
misfires, it's this sort of White House exaggeration that could fuel
a backlash.</TE>
<TE>   The president's father, after building up Hussein as an
international ogre, called the U.S. military off when the Iraqi
despot's days seemed numbered. This outcome fed voters' sense of a
Bush failure. Since then, the Republican presidential victory in 2000
has not only restored a Bush to the White House but has also brought
back the GOP war-management teams of 1974-75 (the end of fighting in
Vietnam) and 1990-91 (the Gulf War). Their hunger for revenge must be
almost palpable.</TE>
<TE>   This is dynastic-type policymaking never before seen in the United
States. True, our sixth president, John Quincy Adams, became
president like his father. But that was 24 years later, and his
father, who belonged to a different party, left no unfinished war as
a legacy.</TE>
<TE>   The return of defense secretaries and White House chiefs of staff
from previous wartime periods is just as unprecedented. It suggests a
rare combination of unrequited frustrations and motivations.
Consider: In spring 1975, when the war in Vietnam ended with the fall
of South Vietnam to the communists and Cambodians seized the U.S.
merchant ship Mayaguez, Donald H. Rumsfeld, now Defense secretary,
was the White House chief of staff and Dick Cheney, now vice
president, was his deputy.</TE>
<TE>   Former President Bush recalled Southeast Asian embarrassments in
1991, when he pledged that the Gulf War "will not be another
Vietnam." Cheney was around then, too, as secretary of Defense. When
the U.S. appeared victorious, Bush exclaimed that, "We've kicked the
Vietnam syndrome once and for all."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, he was mistaken. For the war leaders of 1975 and
1991, two decades of being embarrassed by pipsqueak countries have
lengthened to three. Arguably, this, not the chemical or biological
weapons never used by Hussein in 1991, is what truly goads the
Bush-Rumsfeld-Cheney threesome.</TE>
<TE>   Some Republicans have labeled the Bush duel with Hussein as
opportunistic from the start. The U.S supported Iraq during its war
with Iran in the 1980s, despite Baghdad's use of chemical weapons.
Moreover, April Glaspie, U.S. ambassador to Iraq during the first
Bush administration, seems to have given Hussein a partial go-ahead
to take some border oil wells just before he went farther and seized
all of Kuwait in August 1990. Then the White House mood shifted.
According to the autobiography of the late Treasury secretary and
Texas Gov. John Connally, a home-state dynastic foe of the Bushes,
the president's father was roused by a midsummer conversation with
then-British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. "George," she told
him, "I was about to be defeated in England when the Falkland
conflict happened in 1982. I stayed in office eight years after
that."</TE>
<TE>   The public seems to sense the personal element in the White House
duel with Hussein. With three weeks to go until the midterm
elections, that leaves an unfortunate question: Where is the
congressional opposition raising serious questions about which White
House motivations are real and which are spurious?</TE>

<LD>WASHINGTON -- The recent trial of Derek and Alex King, the 12- and
13-year-old Florida brothers who killed their father after being
sexually molested by a neighbor, has refocused national attention on
the practice of trying juveniles as adults. Florida, where the boys
face life sentences and where one out of every eight juveniles in
America's adult prisons is locked up, is once again the battleground
for this debate.</LD>
<LD>   But like the nationally publicized case of Lionel Tate, a Florida
12-year-old who received a sentence of life without possibility of
parole, the King brothers' case does more to distract from the real
issues of trying children as adults than it does to inform them.</LD>
<LD>   That's because in Florida, the majority of youths prosecuted in
adult courts are tried for nonviolent offenses. Only 2% were tried
for murder, the crime we most often hear about when this issue is
brought up. Nearly half had one or no prior felony convictions. In
most of the cases, youths were sent to adult court without having had
a chance to be rehabilitated by the state's most intensive level of
juvenile justice programs.</LD>
<TE>   Instead of focusing on anomalies, we need to look at more typical
cases like that of Adam Bollenback, a 17-year-old mentally disabled
boy with a history of substance abuse. At age 16, Adam stole a
six-pack of beer from a neighbor's garage and then managed to slip
away from a patrol car after being caught. Not only was he prosecuted
as an adult; he was given a 10-year prison sentence. During the
sentencing, Judge Ric Howard noted approvingly, "This sentence is
going to break your spirit right now."</TE>
<TE>   Following the sentencing, Adam's lawyer asked that the boy be
segregated from adult inmates, but Howard rejected the request,
stating, "He's an adult, and he's going to be treated as an adult."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview following the sentencing, the garage owner,
Charlotte Coadic, said, "If I had known [his age], I wouldn't have
called the cops, I would have given him a good tongue-lashing and
sent him home."</TE>
<TE>   But while the King brothers' case was widely covered by the news
media, Adam's received limited local coverage. Unless you read the
St. Petersburg Times, it is unlikely you have heard of him.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is it likely you heard about Anthony Laster, a 15-year-old
near-deaf, mentally retarded boy, also from Florida. Anthony was
prosecuted as an adult in Palm Beach County after his first arrest.
His crime? He stole $2 from another boy in middle school. No weapon.
No physical harm to the victim. A classic lunch-money theft resulting
in young Anthony spending the first Christmas after his mother died
in an adult jail.</TE>
<TE>   What's going on here? Has the behavior of America's young people
really deteriorated so badly that we need to hand out adult time for
petty crime? What happens when we dispatch these hapless youngsters
into adult prisons? And, perhaps most important, is our punitive
approach to youth crime an effective way to address public safety, or
are we just sending young people to graduate schools for crime?</TE>
<TE>   The most recent national crime statistics show that youth crime is
at its lowest level in decades. According to the FBI, between 1993
and 2000 there was a 74% decline in homicides by youths, eclipsing
the decline in homicides by adults during the same period. This put
killings by kids at the lowest level in decades.</TE>
<TE>   The same is true with overall youth crime. According to the
National Crime Victimization Survey, in 1998 youth crime was at its
lowest level in the 25-year history of the survey.</TE>
<TE>   Still, record numbers of young people are incarcerated in
America's adult prisons and jails, where evidence shows that they are
at great risk for their personal safety. During the 1990s, 47 states
made it easier to try juveniles as adults, and there are
approximately 17,000 minors in America's adult prisons and jails on
any given day.</TE>
<TE>   This, despite the fact that research shows that when young people
are locked up with adults, they are five times more likely to be
sexually assaulted and eight times more likely to commit suicide as
when they are confined in juvenile facilities.</TE>
<TE>   In Florida, a Miami Herald report found that youths in the state's
adult prisons were 21 times more likely to report being assaulted or
injured as children in juvenile facilities. Michael Myers, a
16-year-old from Broward County, was sent into Florida's adult
prisons and, by age 17, was dead. On May 8, 1997, Michael's future
roommate, an adult inmate with an extensive and violent prison
record, wrote to the Department of Corrections, "I will do my best to
injure any roommate I may receive in the future." A year later,
Michael was placed in this inmate's cell and was strangled to death
by him.</TE>
<TE>   Adult imprisonment for youth crime is by no means meted out
equally across racial and ethnic lines. Research by the Building
Blocks for Youth initiative found that nationally, even when they had
been convicted of similar crimes and had similar prior records of
institutionalization, African American and Latino youths were more
likely to be sentenced to adult prisons than white youths. In
Florida, black youths are three times as likely to be sentenced to
adult prisons as white youths.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, about one in 13 of Florida's 70,000 state prisoners
entered the adult system for crimes they committed when they were 17
or younger. Since Florida law denies voting rights for life to anyone
convicted of a felony, this means that there are substantial numbers
of youths who lost their right to vote before they were even old
enough to have exercised it.</TE>
<TE>   If locking kids up in adult prisons were the answer to crime some
claim it to be, Florida should be a juvenile-crime-free paradise by
now. But despite the harshness of Florida's youth crime policies,
which even include the death penalty for juveniles, there is no
evidence that they have had a positive impact on public safety.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1993, the year before Florida's Legislature made it much
easier for prosecutors to try juveniles as adults, Florida's serious
juvenile arrest rate fell by 13%, while the serious juvenile arrest
rate for the United States as a whole declined by a much more
impressive 53%. In 1993, Florida's serious juvenile arrest rate was
twice the national average. Now, Florida's serious juvenile arrest
rate is nearly four times the national average.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Florida's Department of Juvenile Justice released a
comprehensive study concluding that, when you lock up a teenager with
an adult prisoner, he gets more then a cellmate: He gets a role
model. Youths transferred to adult courts in Florida were twice as
likely to re-offend as youths sent to the juvenile justice system for
similar crimes and with similar records.</TE>
<TE>   Six out of 10 youths interviewed in adult prisons said being
locked up with adults had either no effect on their behavior or made
it worse. One youth in an adult prison noted, "In prison, you learn
too much wrong. People are crammed together and have all day long to
talk. They talk about crimes they got away with. And the ones that
got caught ask the ones who got away with it how to do it. You learn
too much." By comparison, a youngster interviewed in a juvenile
facility said, "They helped me know how to act. I never knew any of
this stuff. That really helped me, cause I ain't had too good a
life."</TE>
<TE>   There is no question that violent and dangerous youths need to be
securely confined for our safety and theirs. But incarcerating youths
with more sophisticated adult prisoners renders them vulnerable to
attack and more damaged when they return to society. This is
tantamount to giving up on them -- something we should never do. Our
challenge as responsible adults is to create a fairer and more
effective youth justice system, where there is a balance among
prevention, treatment and punishment that gives kids a chance to make
a better choice.</TE>

<HD>Locked in War's Embrace</HD>
<DH>Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon needs Hamas and its
suicide bombers to destroy Yasser Arafat and his Palestinian
Authority.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amy Wilentz</AU>
<BD>Amy Wilentz is the author, most recently, of "Martyrs'
Crossing: A Novel."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK -- Ariel Sharon's nickname is "the Bulldozer." He's called
that because of his temperament, a man who brooks no challenge and
who ignores all obstacles. But in recent times, the sobriquet has
become more literal. As prime minister of Israel, the Bulldozer's
favorite policy instrument has been the bulldozer -- platoons of
them, in fact.</LD>
<LD>   The bulldozer does Sharon's hard work for him; it has become his
political alter ego. He uses it to tear down the houses of relatives
of Palestinians suspected of participating in terror attacks on
Israel. He uses it to create access into the warrens of refugees in
the camps. He uses it to knock down the walls of the Muqata, Yasser
Arafat's Ramallah headquarters, and then to knock down some of the
buildings there, and then to knock down some more of the buildings
there, some more walls. Today, the Muqata is just rubble and a single
building, and the Israelis, who have ostensibly lifted the siege
against the Palestinian leader at U.S. urging, have merely retreated
25 or so yards to the Muqata's periphery--or former periphery. The
sad irony of this seemingly endless real estate battle is that before
the complex was turned over to Arafat's authority in 1994, the Muqata
was the central command for Israel's occupation of the West Bank. Two
peoples, so tightly bound to each other, etc., etc.</LD>
<TE>   True to type, Sharon is a person who does not hesitate to invade
another's "personal space." He's not standoffish. During the days of
Oslo, he was not much visible, but you knew he was around. One way to
sense the presence was to walk through the Arab quarter of
Jerusalem's Old City. If you passed by a certain doorway there, you'd
notice that it was guarded by two or three Israeli soldiers in full
uniform, with machine guns. If you bothered to inquire about what
important building this could be, you'd be told that this was a house
that Sharon had bought in the quarter. Just to show he could do it,
people said. To make a point. That he had the right. This house and
the reason he occupied it certainly came to mind when Sharon showed
he had the right to march on the Temple Mount in September 2000 and,
by doing so, gave the Palestinians the final excuse they needed to
begin the bloody and destructive Al Aqsa intifada.</TE>
<TE>   The battle over Arafat's Muqata has really been a microcosm of the
battle over the eventual political status of the Palestinians. By
now, there can be no mistaking what Sharon's plans are: the
destruction of the Palestinian Authority and the retaking of the West
Bank, and probably Gaza in some guise (although it has often been
said of Gaza: Who would want it? Which is why it has been shoved back
and forth so often, even in its recent history, among neighboring
peoples).</TE>
<TE>   The Bulldozer is not a man of subtlety. He does what he means to
do: If he destroys the authority, that's because that's what he
wanted to do; he will not do it by accident. If in the process he
elevates Hamas and its political power, it's a price he's clearly
willing to pay. If by some chance his actions against Arafat make
Arafat more popular among the Palestinians, that's fine. He does not
seem to spend a lot of time preoccupied with the future of
Palestinian democracy. Democracy for the Palestinians, like peace
with them, is not something that weighs on Sharon's conscience. He
sees himself as at war with Palestine; in his mind, Israel is waging
eternal war against the implacable, inhuman Arab foe. When suicide
bombs are exploding everywhere, you begin to think he might be right.</TE>
<TE>   But he's not. It's important to peer through the smoke and blood,
and look for truth, not bombast. An acceptable peace would be
accepted, and it doesn't have to be a peace where one side is removed
from the scene. Clearly, it can include neither the old formula of
sweeping the Jews into the sea nor the new formula of sweeping the
Palestinians out of the territories. After many years of delusion,
the Palestinians recognized that they were not going to uproot the
Israelis, and they came to the peace talks -- to oversimplify for a
moment. During the days of Oslo, people, including Israelis, talked
about the two-state solution, or if they did not like that, the
one-state solution. But no one, except Hamas and Meir Kahane's Kach
party, talked about the elimination of populations.</TE>
<TE>   Now that Oslo has come undone, however, certain Israelis (and
Sharon has not divorced himself from them) have begun once again to
contemplate what was started in 1948: actually getting rid of the
Palestinians, moving them out. The plan, which is now euphemistically
called "transfer," seems more plausible today than it did then,
because of Israel's incomparably superior firepower. During Sharon's
campaign, the bumper stickers and posters around Israel used to read
"Sharon = Peace and Security." Now, even more ominously, they read:
"Transfer = Peace and Security." At the end of e-mails sent out by
Israeli settler organizations, there is a line that reads: "Take it
back. Take it all back."</TE>
<TE>   What is happening now in Israel and on the West Bank and in Gaza
looks like war because it is war. Sharon operates outside anything
that might semi-reasonably still be called a peace process, and the
reason why? Because he does not believe in peace with Palestinians.
It is beyond his imagining. When Sharon sees peace or anything like
it, he goes after it, like a child with a tower made of blocks. It
tempts his hand. What seemed to bring him into the most recent siege
of the Muqata (and can there ever be another? Is there enough left?)
was that, according to Israeli military intelligence, the Palestinian
Authority's Tanzim and Al Aqsa wings had quietly established a
cease-fire; that Palestinians were actually talking about replacing
Arafat; that members of Palestinian civil society had condemned
suicide bombing.</TE>
<TE>   All this taken together with President Bush's interest in a
Palestinian state meant, to anyone who was watching, that the
Palestinians were gearing themselves up for another foray into
international legitimacy and peace. Peace is the tower Sharon cannot
leave standing. So the Bulldozer waited for another suicide bombing,
which Hamas gladly provided, as usual, and used it as a pretext to go
after the Palestinian Authority again.</TE>
<TE>   One could mention Sharon's insane preoccupation with the
authority, and his laying responsibility for all violence against
Israel at Arafat's door. One could discuss his reasons for doing so
(destroy putative peace partner; end silly Oslo talk once and for
all; keep Israel intact as is; extend the occupation ... ), and for
attacking Arafat every time Hamas or anyone else strikes. One could
say that nothing has been so obviously cynical as Sharon's destroying
Arafat's security apparatus while demanding that the Palestinian
president clamp down on Hamas et al. But the argument has moved
beyond all this. All this is, in a sense, restating what ought by now
to be evident.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the Muqata, the house of Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the
quadriplegic eminence grise of Hamas, which sits down a dusty street
behind a basketball court in Gaza, still stands. No bulldozer has
bulldozed it. In fact, Yassin's low, modest home has never been
attacked by the Israeli Defense Forces, never been shelled. One could
mention the fact that for all Abdulaziz Rantisi's terrible bluster
and menace, the IDF has also never touched this senior Hamas
official, who is frequently quoted and not exactly in hiding. Why,
one wonders, is Yassin's house intact while Arafat's headquarters are
in ruins?</TE>
<TE>   The likely answer is that Sharon and Hamas have the same agenda:
the destruction of peace. The extremes dance to each other's music,
and Sharon must be fully aware that after smashing peace each time it
rears its ugly head, he will be left to deal with Hamas. Hamas has
just been one of his tools for getting rid of the Palestinian
Authority and everything it stands for. Once that's done, Hamas will
be easier to run under: It has no standing, no international
legitimacy, no Western friends. He can just blow it away.</TE>
<TE>   The only problem with this scenario, like all scenarios envisioned
by the blindered Sharon, is that other factors, sometimes outside
factors, come into play in the Middle East. It's not all about him
and Israel. There is Sept. 11 and the great feeling of solidarity
among Arabs that America's war against the Taliban's Afghanistan
engendered. The Arab street, as it is called, is likely to side with
any Palestinian movement, including Hamas, against the Israelis in
any coming confrontation.</TE>
<TE>   There is also the growing U.S. distaste for Sharon's smashing and
crashing, as President Bush tries to placate the Arab world while
preparing to wage war against one of its constituents. Sharon is in a
tight spot, one that demands a feel for diplomatic niceties and a
sensitivity to nuance, qualities he is not known for. Sharon, or at
least Israel, needs the counterweight of moderate Palestinians, like
the ones who signed a document disavowing suicide bombings. The
Palestinian cause will not vanish without some real justice for
Palestinians. Neither occupation, nor fences, nor transfer will end
the bloodshed. Even justice may not end it completely -- but it will,
or would have, gone a long way.</TE>
<TE>   This is why Sharon has never been so questioned and so doubted
among Israelis as he has in the wake of his last descent on the
Muqata. He has been leading the country down a dark and dangerous
path, and more of his countrymen all the time are reluctant to
follow.</TE>
<TE>   The opposition in Israel is now making some feeble movements, and
one can only hope it will have the courage -- and it takes a lot of
courage when your own people are being blown up around the corner --
to continue to challenge Sharon in a meaningful way, and loudly.
Following his own instincts and impulses, the general has unwittingly
let his country down. The opposition cannot afford to do so. If the
Israeli peace movement and its natural political allies move
together, as they have in the past, it is possible that Sharon's
political future will end up buried beneath the ruins of the
buildings his bulldozers took down.</TE>

<HD>Behind the wheel of the RV craze</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The fastest-growing means of vacationing in America is the
recreational vehicle. It can be your best friends who have just
returned from a three-month trip through the national parks, in a
shiny new motor home, and claim it's the best thing they've ever
done. It can be your neighbors who have bought a trailer they're
going to use to "winter" in a luxury RV resort. It could be you,
getting away from it all, buying a recreational vehicle and taking
off to see the great outdoors, the sights of the Southwest or the
grandchildren scattered across the land.</LD>
<LD>   But how do you get started? A recreational vehicle is a major
investment that can exceed $50,000. Is it worth the outlay? Will you
enjoy the lifestyle of the semi-nomad? Will you get restless and
claustrophobic, or will you have the travel experience of a lifetime?
A bit of analysis is in order.</LD>
<LD>   Here are the advantages:</LD>
<TE>   In an RV, you follow your own flexible time schedule. No fixed
reservations, no dependence on others (hotels, trains, planes). You
don't pack and unpack. You cook when you like, eating out only when
you wish.</TE>
<TE>   You can take your pets along. You can visit friends or relatives
anywhere in the country without imposing on them: Your RV, parked in
their driveway, becomes your private guest cottage -- as well as your
summer beach house and your winter chalet.</TE>
<TE>   You make friends easily upon arriving at a campground or RV
resort. RVers are, in general, enthusiasts who love their lifestyle
and like sharing it with new people. They are constantly attending
rallies, caravans and camp-outs, and meeting with other RVers to
share common interests. "It's difficult to be lonely in a
campground," one confirmed RVer told me.</TE>
<TE>   RV travel is economical. You can purchase fresh local produce on
the road and cook your own meals. Your stay at campgrounds is usually
nominal ($10 to $20 a night is typical). And there's no one to tip.</TE>
<TE>   Here are the drawbacks:</TE>
<TE>   RV travel is not for everyone; it might not be for you. A
Philadelphia couple I know who recently spent four months traveling
across the country in a motor home issued the following caveats: "Be
sure you feel extremely comfortable with whomever you will be
traveling with. You're going to spend long periods of time in close
quarters. Be sure you're an expert driver and enjoy spending long
periods on the road. Above all, don't take this kind of trip unless
you're flexible and able to cope with new situations, which happen
all the time. Mechanical breakdowns are not uncommon, and you have to
be able to handle them without getting upset."</TE>
<TE>   Like many first-time RVers, my informants began by renting a motor
home to get used to driving a large vehicle and to spending a great
deal of driving time together. Now they're so enthusiastic that
they're planning to sell their suburban home, move into a small
apartment, buy an RV and spend at least six months on the road each
year. "The excitement and variety of life cannot be compared with any
travel experience we've ever had--and we're experienced foreign
travelers," they say. "It's a new kind of life, a brand-new world we
never saw before."</TE>
<TE>   The first step is to look in your telephone directory under
"Recreational Vehicles -- Renting and Leasing." Or you can call one
of the four national companies: Cruise America, (800) 327-7799,
www.cruiseamerica.com; Bates International Motor Home Rental Network,
(800) 732-2283, www.batesintl.com; El Monte RV Center, (888)
337-2214, www.elmonterv.com; or Altman's Winnebago, (800) 400-0787,
www.altmans.com. It's also useful to visit the Web site of the
Recreational Vehicles Rental Assn. at www.rvra.org. It contains a
list of companies that rent RVs, including prices and addresses, in
almost all of the 50 states.</TE>
<TE>   Rental costs vary considerably, depending on the type of vehicle,
when and for how long you want it, season and other variables.</TE>
<TE>   One way to get a good price is to regularly check the Web sites of
the major rental outfits, which periodically post specials. From one
company, I secured a quote of $45 a day plus 39 cents per mile for a
particularly elegant 22-foot camper trailer that can sleep two adults
and two children. One of the grander motor homes -- a 26-foot
Alumalite by Holiday Rambler or a 27-foot Southwind by Fleetwood --
will average $800 a week plus low-cost mileage (after an initial
number of free miles). But that's for a vehicle that can sleep six
people and is self-contained, with such features as a microwave oven,
roof air-conditioning, generator and propane tank (so a hookup is not
necessary), power steering and almost everything else you can name.</TE>
<TE>   The most important step is comparison shopping before you rent.
Make sure you understand the terms of the agreement, take your
vehicle out for a test spin and reserve as far in advance as
possible. Indeed, the RV life is becoming so popular that a
reservation several months in advance might not be a bad idea.</TE>

<HD>An autumn walk through Calaveras County's majestic groves</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>One hundred and fifty years ago, about 20 miles northeast of a Gold
Rush camp near Murphys, hunter Augustus Dowd chased a bear into the
woods.</LD>
<LD>   Very big woods, as it turned out. So big that Dowd, a meat
supplier, had a hard time convincing his disbelieving customers back
at the camp. But soon he persuaded them to travel to the woods, where
his account proved to be no tall tale.</LD>
<LD>   The largest specimen in the grove was the Discovery Tree, a
300-foot sequoia with a base more than 24 feet in diameter. In 1853,
a year after Dowd discovered it, the tree was chopped down and
shipped in sections to New York City, where it was reassembled and
placed on exhibit.</LD>
<TE>   The Discovery Tree wowed New Yorkers and, later, Londoners. And to
John Muir's horror, its enormous stump was converted into a dance
floor by the grove's owner.</TE>
<TE>   Before dozens of other sequoia forests were discovered on the
western slopes of the Sierra Nevada, the North Grove that Dowd
discovered in Calaveras County was believed to be the only one. That
made it a cause celebre for scientists and environmentally concerned
politicians.</TE>
<TE>   Muir suggested that the sequoia grove would be "a fine center for
the student and a delicious place for the weary." He decried the
felling of the trees in an angry essay titled "The Vandals Then
Danced Upon the Stump!"</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,000 ancient sequoias remain preserved within the
6,500-acre Calaveras Big Trees State Park, which includes Dowd's
North Grove as well as a second group of sequoias, called South
Grove. The best way to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the trees'
discovery is to walk among them on lovely trails nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Autumn in Gold Country means colorful foliage, pleasant days and
nippy nights, as well as uncrowded roads and trails. The state park's
sequoia groves include beautiful reddish mountain dogwood.</TE>
<TE>   Start your visit at the park's museum and visitor center, where a
donation of $1 or more will get you detailed interpretive pamphlets
with historical background and maps for North Grove and South Grove
trails.</TE>
<TE>   First, some advice: Skip the three-mile, viewless Lava Bluff
Trail. The bluff was the bed of the Stanislaus River until a lava
flow filled it long ago. Yawn. The river took another course, and so
should you.</TE>
<TE>   Instead try a gentle one-mile trail that meanders through North
Grove, leading to grand sequoias with names such as Abraham Lincoln,
Empire State and the Father of the Forest. Among the path's sights is
the stump of the Discovery Tree and a tree that has a hollowed-out
trunk.</TE>
<TE>   Much less visited is the park's remote South Grove. The trail here
offers terrific hiking among a greater number of sequoias, as well as
tall sugar and ponderosa pines, incense cedar and a few big leaf
maples. The path leads to the 250-foot-tall Agassiz Tree, one of the
10 largest Sierra redwoods.</TE>
<TE>   You can extend your sojourn on the Bradley Grove Trail. This 2
1/2-mile path loops through land logged in the early 1950s. Park
caretaker Owen Bradley planted seedlings around that time, and about
150 sequoias are thriving in the grove, a testament to forest
regeneration.</TE>
<TE>   Calaveras Big Trees State Park is off Highway 4, about four miles
northeast of Arnold and about 20 miles northeast of Angels Camp.</TE>
<TE>   North Grove Trail starts from the day-use parking area near the
park entrance. South Grove Trail starts nine miles southeast, off
Walter W. Smith Memorial Parkway.</TE>

<LD>James T. Yenckel's article, "Oases of Luxury in the Desert" (Oct. 6),
failed to note that Charles H. Keating Jr. and the now-defunct
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn., which he controlled, were involved in
the financing and construction of the Phoenician.</LD>
<LD>   That fact is almost a historical footnote today, but it won't be

<LD>Susan Spano's article, "Kitschy Keepsakes From Family Car Trips
Remain the Stuff of Memories" (Oct. 6), brought back wonderful
memories of our family's first car trip from California to my
parents' hometown in Iowa in the 1960s.</LD>
<LD>   My mother wanted to be sure we collected some nice souvenirs along
the way. Before we left home, she gave my two sisters and me silver
bracelets so we could collect charms at places we visited. Almost 40
years later I still have my bracelet, with dozens of charms and
wonderful memories.</LD>

<LD>Thank you for "The Best Vacations Start With a Great Itinerary,
Whether on a Tour or Alone" (Her World, Sept. 29).</LD>
<LD>   I am a serious travel planner. Although some of my friends and
family think I over-plan vacations, I find the trips much more
enjoyable when I do plan.</LD>
<LD>   Planning does not mean you need to be trapped in a
minute-by-minute agenda. Rather it allows you to take full advantage
of your travel time.</LD>

<CP>PHOTO: "Whenever we're walking anywhere," says Thousand Oaks
reader Lesly Vick, "I always look up to see the architecture." A few
months ago, she had her eyes peeled in Pezenas, near Narbonne in
southern France. What caught her attention wasn't one of the town's
16th and 17th century mansions but baskets of plants set out for
fresh air about four stories high, thoughtfully shaded from the
summer sun.</CP>

<HD>From seedy to 'SoHo' in Vancouver</HD>
<DH>Boutiques, nightclubs and restaurants have transformed
Yaletown into the city's trendiest neighborhood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Margo Pfeiff</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>Vancouver, Canada</DL>
<LD>In my younger days, when I was traveling eight months out of the
year, all my worldly possessions were stored in a locker in a
warehouse in a seedy district called Yaletown, near Vancouver's
waterfront. Back then, my father wouldn't let me go there alone in
the evenings.</LD>
<LD>   These days, it is I who must accompany my father to Yaletown -- to
help him decipher the latest yuppie trends. A brick-walled bistro now
occupies that warehouse, and it's beside a trendy spa and just down
the street from Don't Shoot the Elephant, a chic Asian tearoom where
you can peruse Vogue Taiwan and listen to the city's biggest
collection of Norwegian CDs while sipping a green tea latte.</LD>
<LD>   They've finally done it right in Vancouver, a city renowned for
demolishing anything old or with character. (The one exception is
Gastown, the city's birthplace, but its tourist focus keeps locals
away.) Often called "Vancouver's Little SoHo," Yaletown has evolved
over the last decade into an ultra-hip residential neighborhood.
Housed in the old redbrick warehouses are nightclubs, a brew pub,
cafes, art studios, galleries and some of the city's best restaurants
and most interesting boutiques. The elevated, brick-paved loading
docks are crowded with sidewalk tables, their cantilevered canopies
now shading the Palm Pilot set from sun and rain as they chat over
chai and watch the passing parade
of hip Vancouverites.</LD>
<TE>   It was at one of those cafes, Seattle's Best Coffee, that I
met with my friend Kasey Wilson, a food writer and radio personality. I
was in Vancouver visiting family and was keen to explore this
rehabbed section of my hometown; Kasey promised me a walking tour of
the neighborhood that she has called home for eight years.</TE>
<TE>   It seems everyone knows everyone else in Yaletown. At the cafe,
friends greeted one another on arrival and knew the wait staff by
name. As we walked through the area, people stopped to chat with
Kasey.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a small town, a closely knit neighborhood," she said.</TE>
<TE>   On the waterfront</TE>
<TE>   Yaletown's renaissance seemed to be a long time coming,
considering its prime location alongside the downtown core and within
roller-blading distance of the sea wall and Stanley Park.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1880s, when Vancouver was the western terminus of the
Canadian Pacific Railway, the company built rail yards and repair
facilities in Yaletown alongside False Creek, an inlet off Georgia
Strait. Heavy industry, from shingle mills to cement works, followed
the railroad. In the early 1900s, rows of six-story brick warehouses
were built for small manufacturers and shipping companies that took
advantage of easily accessible rail transport. Their wide loading
docks, with sloping, overhanging roofs, sheltered goods from the rain
as they were loaded onto boxcars lined up on rails alongside Hamilton
and Mainland streets. Yaletown became Vancouver's industrial heart.</TE>
<TE>   The area suffered badly in the 1940s, when manufacturers turned to
the highways to move goods, and it continued its downward slide into
the 1970s, becoming the domain of the rag trade, storage facilities
and tough bars. Many of its industrial sites were razed before Expo
'86 briefly energized the Yaletown waterfront.</TE>
<TE>   The old warehouses that remained were gradually taken over by
artists and bohemians seeking large spaces, abundant light and low
rents. The rag trade and rough bars have given way to lofts, studios
and offices for multimedia and high-tech businesses. And to preserve
its 19th century industrial character, Yaletown has been designated a
historic district, which means that the buildings can be used for new
businesses but that their exteriors and character must be maintained.
Some of the old rooming houses where Canadian Pacific workers stayed,
like the Yale Hotel, now a popular spot for live blues, remain much
as they did in the past, and the redbrick Roundhouse, where steam
locomotives were once repaired, is a community center. Steam engine
No. 374, the first train to cross Canada in 1887, is also in the
Roundhouse complex. Just outside the boundaries of Yaletown are the
dramatic new public library, a coliseum-shaped building designed by
noted Israeli-born, Montreal-educated architect Moshe Safdie, who
also designed the nearby Ford Centre for the Performing Arts.</TE>
<TE>   Although Yaletown doesn't cater to tourists -- the area's first
hotel, Opus, a contemporary boutique inn that reflects its trendy
location, didn't open until Sept. 16 -- its shops and restaurants are
attracting visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Roughly eight square blocks bounded by Nelson, Homer, Drake and
Pacific streets, Yaletown is safe and easily walkable; gentrification
has squeezed out the prostitution and drug trade that once haunted
its streets. Even the early Yaletown bohemian pioneers were forced to
flee as the area -- and the rents and condo prices -- moved upscale.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the shops and galleries are centered on Hamilton and
Mainland, two narrow, one-way streets where, in places, you can still
see the old railway tracks through the asphalt. Just up Homer Street
are the latest in cool restaurants and nightspots. Some are so
popular with 20-year-olds and Botox beauties that there is a
three-week wait for reservations. Lucy Mae Brown's was named for the
proprietor of the 1900s-era brothel and opium den that the restaurant
occupies.</TE>
<TE>   "Chain stores did move in," Kasey said, "but it wasn't what people
here wanted, so they were forced to shut down." Several prominent
Canadian clothing companies cycled in and then out. Now shops like
Global Atomic Designs, which sells hip fashions, and high-end home
furnishing shops like Chintz &amp; Co. dominate. The area's trademark is
small, one-of-a-kind gems like La Bottega del Mediterraneo, stuffed
with imported Italian dishes and home wares. An all-cookbook shop
called Barbara-Jo's Books to Cooks offers cooking classes several
times a week with local and visiting chefs.</TE>
<TE>   And there are all manner of galleries, including Coastal People,
which specializes in Northwest Coast native art.</TE>
<TE>   Even grocery stores in Yaletown are chic. At Urban Fare, a
Zabar's-like food mart, every shopping cart has a coffee holder, and
there is a cafe featuring live music on weekends. Among the 40 kinds
of fresh bread on the shelves is a $100 loaf that is baked fresh in a
Paris bakery every morning, then couriered to Vancouver.</TE>
<TE>   Seafood, raw or cooked</TE>
<TE>   You can't spend more than an hour with a food writer before it's
time to eat. Kasey and I started our culinary explorations at the
comfortable, Nantucket-y Rodney's Oyster House, where we were served
chowder and oysters (at 11 a.m., our lunch appetizers) in an
atmosphere of whitewashed brick and biceps by a handsome shucker
named Ian. Rodney's has a dozen or more fresh oyster varieties daily
and goes through 800 raw oysters on a typical Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   For the main course, we moved on to Cioppino's Mediterranean Grill
&amp; Enoteca, informally called "Pino's" after chef Pino Posteraro,
whose illustrious career has included cooking for Frank Sinatra.
Cioppino's is considered one of Vancouver's best Italian restaurants,
and just down the block on Hamilton Street is the Blue Water Cafe and
Raw Bar, one of the city's best for seafood.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Water has two exceptional chefs who literally face off
against each other. Chef Max Katsuno presides over the raw bar at the
southern end of the restaurant. His trademark is two- and
three-tiered servings of sushi and sashimi. In the northwestern
kitchen at the opposite side of the restaurant is chef James Walt,
who produces such innovative gems as local line-caught halibut with
oyster veloute, white asparagus and squid tempura. Its 600-bottle
wine list has earned Blue Water Cafe the Wine Spectator Award of
Excellence.</TE>
<TE>   Working off all that eating is easy in Yaletown. There are yoga
and Pilates studios. At the foot of Davie Street, alongside the sea
wall that curves for eight miles around Stanley Park, the Reckless
Bike Shop rents cycles and skates. Or catch one of the small electric
Aquabus ferries that depart regularly for points around False Creek,
including the Science Center and Granville Island Public Market,
where you can rent kayaks. Or visit one of Yaletown's spas, as I did.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll give you a couple of minutes to dress down to your comfort
level," chimed lovely Trang Tran, the esthetician who administered my
"Facialiscious" at the Skoah Spa. Jamie McKeough and Chris Scott made
up the name of the spa from their last names. "We checked 77
languages, including Yiddish and Finnish, to make sure it didn't mean
anything," Jamie told me. They created the tranquil spa out of a
place that once was a poolroom.</TE>
<TE>   "Does your face need a complete overhaul?" the spa menu asked. How
many women could say no to that? "Facialiscious" turned out to be a
decadent facial that included a foot and neck massage on a heated
massage table. My facial was a procession of organic, largely
fruit-based products from a Hungarian company called Eminence. By the
time Trang had finished massaging, masquing, toning and polishing my
face with delicious potions of apricot, peach and honeydew, I'll be
darned if I wasn't hungry again.</TE>
<TE>   So I was glad that after my spa session I had arranged to meet
Kasey at Brix, a popular tapas restaurant on Homer Street. We sat in
its very European open courtyard, which at the turn of the 20th
century was used by trucks delivering cattle to the building, then a
slaughterhouse. Chatting with owner Patrick Mercer, we nibbled on
black tea-smoked chicken flat bread and apricot and avocado salad.</TE>
<TE>   As I sipped a Blue Mountain Pinot Noir and marveled at how much
the British Columbia of my youth had changed to produce such
first-class wines, Patrick echoed my thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   "Who would have thought," he said, holding his arms out wide as if
to encompass all of Yaletown, "that a grubby little corner of
Vancouver like this would one day become this charming little SoHo?"</TE>

<LD>Grimy bathrooms, grumpy management and depressingly overcrowded
dorms. That's what many budget travelers may face if they stay in
hostels in foreign countries. How do you find a good one? Guidebooks
and word of mouth help, and in New Zealand, there's a free booklet of
hostels rated by recent travelers published by Backpacker Budget
Hostels New Zealand. The 2003 edition of its Blue Guide will be out
next month.</LD>
<LD>   New Zealand has a reputation for having the world's best hostels,
and one thing that helps to keep the hostel owners on their toes is
the Blue Guide annual survey, which has been conducted for more than
a decade. The hostel association, which has 300 member hostels, is
operated by two independent hostel owners, Mark Dumble of the Rainbow
Lodge Hostel in Taupo, and Eric Foley of Foley Towers Hostel in
Christchurch.</LD>
<LD>   On Feb. 19, at the height of New Zealand's tourist season, the
hostel association asked guests at 450 budget accommodations around
the country to rate hostels where they stayed on a scale from 1 to
10. (Guests are told to exclude the one they are staying in.) An
independent company tabulated the results, and hostels are rated
based on the responses of at least 30 guests who each stayed at least
one night.</LD>
<TE>   "We expect to be listing around 20 new hostels in the next
edition, bringing the total to well over 300," says Foley, who is
also working on an online survey that will supplement the published
one. The guide includes ratings for budget accommodations in the Cook
Islands.</TE>
<TE>   Free copies of the Blue Guide are available at information
counters at airports, Visitor Information Network offices and
participating hostels. The information also is available online at
www.backpack.co.nz.</TE>
<TE>   Three hostels received the top rating in the 2003 guide. Hopewell
Hostel (011-64-3-573-4341, www.backpack.co.nz/marlbro.html#303), in
the scenic Marlborough Sounds region, scored 98%. You can reach the
secluded lodge by water taxi from Picton. Accommodations in rooms
with two to four beds cost about $9.50 to $11 per person, per night.
The hostel has a log fireplace, trampoline, and kayaks and mountain
bikes available free.</TE>
<TE>   Tied for second place with a rating of 97% is the Old
Slaughterhouse Hostel (011-64-3-782-8333,
www.backpack.co.nz/wcoast.html#568). Known for its views, the hostel
is on Slaughterhouse Hill in Hector, about 22 miles north of Westport
on the South Island's west coast. The area offers beaches, rivers and
walks. The hostel has beds in dormitory rooms starting at $8.50 and
in double rooms at $10.50.</TE>
<TE>   Also earning a 97% rating is the beachfront Moana Lodge
(011-64-4-233-2010, home.clear.net.nz/pages/moanalodge) at
Plimmerton, just north of Wellington. Along with free kayaks, bikes
and Internet services, you'll find accommodations starting at $10 in
a shared room or $12 in a single room.</TE>
<TE>   Foley warns that it's much easier for a rural hostel to get a very
high rating than one in a city center.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers with the Backpacker Budget Hostels Club Card get a
discount of at least $2 on accommodations and reduced rates for some
other backpacker-friendly services, such as a 15% discount on
InterCity or Newmans Coachline fares. The card costs $20 and includes
$9.50 in prepaid phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   The student travel service STA Travel is offering a four-night
package in Fiji that includes two nights at a B&amp;B and two nights on
Robinson Crusoe Island, with breakfasts, two dinners and free water
sports, for $119. This includes the boat ride to the island. For
details, log on to www.statravel.com.</TE>

<LD>Was March 5 a mirage in Orange County's school-funding desert? Or
will residents in a handful of Orange County school districts pick up
where voters left off when they passed six bond issues that will pour
$490 million into badly needed construction projects?</LD>
<LD>   We noted in March that the six school district bond issues will be
used to repair, renovate and replace school buildings that opened
their doors well before Disneyland's since-retired submarine fleet
first set sail.</LD>
<LD>   But a half dozen successful bond measures aren't strong enough
medicine to remedy problems that have accumulated over the decades.
More must be done in other districts where students are sitting in
crowded classrooms and searching for a functioning bathroom.</LD>
<TE>   There is evidence that voters statewide are reconsidering
California's commitment to education. Between 1980 and 2000, slightly
more than half of California's school bond measures won passage. In
March, 13 of 14 community college districts, including the North
Orange County Community College District (which includes Cypress and
Fullerton colleges) passed bond measures.</TE>
<TE>   That success rate is one reason several local districts put bond
issues on the November ballot. But timing is only part of the story.
Rancho Santiago Community College District (which includes Santa Ana
and Santiago Canyon colleges) is asking voters to approve Measure E,
a $337-million bond measure, because it needs to fill gaping holes in
its infrastructure. Rancho Santiago's campus was never completed; at
Santa Ana, students huddle in their cars when it's rainy or cold
because the campus has neither a library nor a student center.</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to assume that the wave of homes still popping up in
Tustin is proof that the city is relatively young. But aging school
buildings are the driving force behind Measure G, an $80-million bond
issue for the Tustin Unified School District. The district built 20
schools between 1956 and 1969. So there's a lengthy list of needed
repairs that includes leaky roofs, aging air-conditioning units and
antiquated water pipes that render bathrooms and drinking fountains
inoperative.</TE>
<TE>   We won't know until next month whether the springtime victories
were simply March Madness or a significant shift in how residents
view their responsibilities toward funding a viable public education.
But students obviously will benefit if it proves to be the latter.</TE>

<HD>'Great' Reason to Pass on 51</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In case California voters need another reason to reject Proposition
51, Irvine Mayor Larry Agran is providing one. Two, actually.</LD>
<LD>   After months of Agranspeak about a Great Park that would replace
the former El Toro air base without using public funds, it turns out
that the mayor has been pushing for more than $100 million in state
money. The park funding is written into the Traffic Congestion Relief
and Safe School Buses Act on the November ballot, a sausage
initiative packed with projects for special interests.</LD>
<LD>   Funny how every so often, a tidbit emerges that shows the amazing
Great Park isn't so great or amazing. First, Irvine officials
described a splendid park and cultural center that would spring up
solely via developer funds. Then came the revelation that developer
money would pay only for basic landscaping; gardens, museums and
recreation centers would be considered "jewelry" in need of
additional funding. It soon became clear that despite early
assertions, there were big concerns about how much toxic cleanup the
Navy was committing to at the old base.</LD>
<TE>   Newport Beach residents, the biggest supporters of an airport at
El Toro, must be sniggering at the latest disclosure--when they
aren't downright fuming. Their slogan calling the Great Park push the
"Great Tax" ends up pretty close to the mark after all.</TE>
<TE>   Agran claims that Great Park supporters never said the park could
spring into existence without public money. This simply is untrue. To
quote the mayor in July, the Great Park "will be developed and
maintained in perpetuity with private dollars."</TE>
<TE>   As if the Great Park millions weren't enough, Proposition 51 would
throw an additional $50 million Irvine's way for a remote air
terminal--a sort of airport without the icky noise from airplanes
that Irvine didn't want at El Toro. Travelers would check their
luggage and catch shuttle buses to LAX and other airports where other
people have to cope with the icky noise.</TE>
<TE>   Agran's pet priorities have as little business at the forefront of
public spending as other projects that would be funded through
Proposition 51, such as the special railroad line that goes straight
to a gambling casino. The Times already has recommended that voters
reject the ill-conceived proposition, which would pull $1 billion a
year out of the general fund--money that's sorely needed for basic
public services.</TE>
<TE>   Agran, you see, sits on the board of the group sponsoring
Proposition 51. And he is making a grab for state taxpayers' money
with little care about the trauma centers that are in danger of
closing and other services that are being slashed because of budget
cuts. Despite pain caused by the state's fiscal crisis, he shows no
twinges of conscience. "Orange County puts in a lot more than we get
back from the state general fund," he says. "... I'm not going to
apologize to anyone for aggressively pursuing projects that serve the
county's public interest."</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to the county's public interest, Agran and the
voters should remember the $39-million hit to the Social Services
Agency in June forced by state cutbacks. The county agency trimmed
welfare-to-work programs, day care, job retraining and transportation
for low-income residents. These people, who cannot afford plane
trips, would have no use for a jet-free air terminal.</TE>
<TE>   Agran and company should stick to the promises they made in July
about the tax-free Great Park and finance it without the state's
general fund.</TE>

<LD>The National Science Foundation has awarded multimillion-dollar
grants to two universities in Orange County, and for the most
heartening of projects. Recognizing that without future scientists
there can be no great science, NSF is giving the grants to train
public-school teachers in the instruction of math and science.</LD>
<LD>   The $14.2 million going to UC Irvine is the biggest NSF grant ever
at the research university, which is known for its science
departments. But this money isn't going for lab research; instead, it
will fund after-school and Saturday lessons for teachers of math and
science. These preschool through high school teachers face the daily
challenge of tutoring youngsters in Compton, Santa Ana and western
Costa Mesa, where many children are poor or know scant English.</LD>
<LD>   Cal State Fullerton professor David Pagni won the largest grant
ever for that school, nearly $6.5 million, to show teachers how to
guide young students into and through advanced math classes. The
money, which also will pay for research to find out what methods of
instruction work best, will be aimed at four Orange County high
schools and their feeder middle schools.</LD>
<TE>   The grants signal the federal government's seriousness about the
importance of well-trained teachers in every classroom, especially in
inner-city schools, where they have been in shorter supply.</TE>
<TE>   A Carnegie Corp. report last month made it clear that there's
little use in raising standards or reducing class sizes without a
corps of well-trained and well-treated teachers.</TE>
<TE>   "The quality of teaching is the single most important factor
influencing student achievement," the report says. "Pupils assigned
to a good teacher can learn a full grade level more than students
assigned to an ineffective teacher."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, put motivated, well-educated teachers into failing
inner-city schools and watch the dramatic improvements in what those
children learn.</TE>
<TE>   By training teachers who already work in impoverished schools, the
UCI grant makes that educational vision a little more realistic for
the school districts it will touch. The NSF grants also align with
other major recommendations in the Carnegie report.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, teachers work all alone in their classrooms," the
report says. "They get no coaching, no feedback and no time to hone
their skills."</TE>
<TE>   That helps explain why 29% of teachers leave the profession within
three years of starting, overwhelmed and exhausted.</TE>
<TE>   The two newly funded projects will tackle exactly that problem by
giving teachers ongoing support and helpful ideas in addition to
greater skills. And it helps answer the call of the Carnegie report
for schools of education to get more directly involved in public
schools by providing ongoing "residency" training and studying which
teaching methods work.</TE>
<TE>   It's a good start that should pay nearly immediate benefits. And
because of their proximity to the universities, Orange County schools
will reap most of the benefit.</TE>

<LD>Re "Philip Morris Ordered to Pay $28 Billion to Smoker," Oct. 5:</LD>
<LD>   I am a former smoker. The decision to quit smoking demanded more
willpower from me than anything I have abstained from. I am reading
about Betty Bullock of Newport Beach, who was just awarded $28
billion in damages from Philip Morris, and her decades-long smoking
habit that is now imposing a limit on her life. I sympathize with her
struggle.</LD>
<LD>   However, I cannot help wondering how a relatively intelligent
woman can be blind to all the danger signs that this habit clearly
gives a smoker. I never needed a cigarette company to let me know how
vulgar and dangerous this habit is: The permeating smell, the effects
on your skin, the constant coughing, the lingering colds, the feeling
that you are a slave to your cigarettes -- as a junkie is to heroin.</LD>
<TE>   There have been warnings on cigarette packages for decades. Anyone
who claims to be lured by the advertising of the tobacco companies is
transferring the accountability for their health to the
manufacturers. This only escalates our country's highly litigious
environment. People should have character enough to know that they,
and only they, control what they do to their bodies.</TE>
<TE>   If we extrapolated this transfer-of-accountability logic, why
couldn't an alcoholic who is charged with the vehicular manslaughter
of a family while driving intoxicated plead for his defense by
pointing the finger of blame at the spirits-maker who lured him into
his drinking habit in the first place?</TE>

<TE>   So Bullock, 64, won a $28-billion judgment against Philip Morris
because cancer she got from smoking will probably take 20 years off
her life? If the figures are correct, that works out to $1.2 billion
a year for each lost year.</TE>
<TE>   It's been known for years that smoking (as well as using illegal
drugs) is harmful to your health. When I was a high school student in
the 1950s, cigarettes were called coffin nails. Each one supposedly
drove another nail in your coffin. She ignored the warnings and
smoked anyway.</TE>
<TE>   I don't want to sound cruel, but is her life really worth $1.2
billion a year?</TE>
<TE>   For 34 years, a motorcycle, rain or shine, was my transportation.
Then I developed, arthritis (probably from racing accidents), asthma
and severe allergies and had to stop riding. Shouldn't I get billions
from Triumph, BMW and Suzuki for my reduced lifestyle?</TE>

<LD>Re "Now Irvine Mayor Is a Major Player," Oct. 7:</LD>
<LD>   Instead of discussing the enormous contributions that have been
made under Larry Agran's leadership during his 16 years on the Irvine
City Council, the article relies on name-calling and half-truths.</LD>
<LD>   It seems to me that The Times, by constantly repeating offensive
names and terms used by Agran's enemies, is responsible for these
continuing attacks.</LD>
<TE>   The Times article pillories a highly educated, articulate, devoted
family man. Agran is resented by the opposition for the very
qualities that have earned him the support of Irvine residents.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, 83% of the electorate voted for Larry Agran. Why
wasn't this enthusiastic response reflected in The Times' article?</TE>
<TE>   Vivian Hall</TE>
<TE>   Irvine</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Agran says of the role I and others took in the anti-airport
fight: "These people are like blisters. They show up after all the
hard work is done. I don't recall a single instance in which they
took part in that campaign."</TE>
<TE>   Fred Smoller, chairman of the political science department at
Chapman University, states: "The Great Park thing has been an amazing
victory, and it was [Agran's] vision."</TE>
<TE>   As a former councilwoman and mayor of Irvine, I spent eight long
years fighting the county's airport proposal. I worked with hundreds
of volunteers to win this battle and we did.</TE>
<TE>   The difference between Agran and myself is clear: I have given
credit to the thousands of volunteers that worked as a community to
accomplish this goal; Agran continually tries to tout himself as the
sole catalyst for this victory.</TE>
<TE>   To update Smoller, Agran was not the visionary for the Great Park.
In fact, the Great Park idea came out of our entire council
discussions with our consultants.</TE>
<TE>   Christina L. Shea</TE>
<TE>   Irvine</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I object to Agran and his City Council allies approving the
transfer of 8,000 housing units from elsewhere to the Northern
Sphere, bloating what was once a 4,000-unit project to a 12,000-unit
project.</TE>
<TE>   This proposal was working its way through the city bureaucracy at
the same time Agran and City Councilman Chris Mears received money at
a fund-raiser hosted by Irvine Co. executives.</TE>
<TE>   Agran rationalizes his behavior by claiming that the Irvine Co.
would have simply taken its project to the county if Agran had
objected. That's preposterous. The reporter apparently failed to ask
Agran if that has ever happened in the history of this city. Not to
my knowledge, it hasn't.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine Co. certainly isn't going to take this mammoth project
elsewhere after helping Agran and Mears retire old campaign debts.</TE>
<TE>   I also object to Agran's quote in the article, where he calls
anti-airport activists who oppose him "blisters" who "show up after
all the hard work is done." Conveniently suffering from a sudden case
of amnesia, Agran said, "I don't recall a single instance in which
they took part in that campaign."</TE>
<TE>   Let me help Agran's memory by reminding him that I was one of the
earliest members of his Project '99 staff. In fact, in 1996 I
co-wrote with him "In Defense of Our Community," a defiant manifesto
declaring the right of Irvine homeowners to protect themselves from
tyrants who, just like King George III in 1776, demanded
unquestioning loyalty from citizens viewed as disobedient children.</TE>
<TE>   The reality is that I, along with former mayor Christina Shea,
Taxpayers for Responsible Planning, the elected officials of south
Orange County, and thousands of citizen activists were the ones who
stopped the El Toro airport.</TE>
<TE>   Agran should go back and read our manifesto, because he's acting
more and more like King George. He does not sit on a throne. He
represents the people of Irvine, even those who did not vote for him.
To dismiss those of us who no longer believe in him as "blisters" is
repugnant. He owes the people of Irvine an apology.</TE>

<TE>   Re: Irvine's Great Park Plan Carries Equal Price," Oct. 8:</TE>
<TE>   Agran continues to be disingenuous, at best, with the Great Park
plan.</TE>
<TE>   While Larry and his fellow obfuscators never said the park "would
cost no money," they certainly did insist that the money would almost
all come from private sources.Cutting back services so that their
funds can be diverted to the park is new taxation. And the bills are
just starting to show up. Next anticipated invoice: environmental
cleanup.</TE>
<TE>   I promise that the lies and surprises won't stop there. In our
lifetime, I predict that all we will realize out of this "park" shall
be 1) a private golf course that most cannot afford to play,
surrounded by private luxury homes that few can afford to own; 2) a
few more light industrial complexes to generate tax revenue for the
benefit of Irvine residents; 3) a wilderness area that shall be
closed off to the public to protect some native moth; and 4) some
soccer fields that can only be used, as is done today, if the
majority of the participants are residents of Irvine and you have all
the permits and the city says that the fields are dry enough that
day.</TE>

<LD>Re "Lopez Recall Effort Qualifies for Ballot," Sept. 27:</LD>
<LD>   The one educational poverty program that has produced mostly all
negative results is bilingual education.</LD>
<LD>   The fast-multiplying cost of continuing this farce has lined the
pockets of its advocates and cheated an uncountable number of Latino
youth from being able to fully enjoy the vast amount of opportunities
America has to offer.</LD>
<TE>   The four mothers of Latino children attending Santa Ana schools
who were the driving force behind the recall of Nativo Lopez, a

<LD>Re "Dark Day in Newport History," Oct. 6:</LD>
<LD>   I'd be interested in knowing how Jan D. Vandersloot votes. Last I
checked, Newport Beach is the cradle of pro-business, right-wing
conservatism. Let's be honest--they couldn't chop those trees down
fast enough and as a 20-year Newport resident, Vandersloot should
have known that.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, he expresses shock and dismay over the city's swift
deployment of the tree-cutters. Memo to Vandersloot: city leaders
come and go and the citizens stay, but until the overwhelmingly
conservative citizens vote in an environmentally conscious way,
they'll have a problem.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is certainly time to move on now that most of the ficus have
been removed. However, the city can do a better job to mollify the
opponents by replacing the ficus trees with more mature and
ornamental trees. If funding for this project is short, perhaps we
can solicit businesses to sponsor all or part of their purchase, care
and planting. In return, they should have the right to place their
business' name on a plaque naming them as the sponsor for a
particular tree chosen by the city.</TE>

<TE>   While America may not meet the strict definition of a colonial

of Los Angeles suggests otherwise. The (Asian) imports were as
follows: furniture, apparel, toys, computer equipment and footwear.
Our exports consist of wastepaper, resins and plastics, raw cotton
and mixed raw scrap. How is it that we have become the major source
of exported raw materials to the sweatshops and developing industrial
powerhouses of the orient, and the major importer of their finished
goods?</TE>

<LD>Re "Failing Magic at Disney," Editorial, Sept. 29:</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County Taxpayers Assn. (OCTax) is puzzled by The Times'
blunt criticism of Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner. In his
18-year tenure, Disney's revenue has grown from less than $2 billion
to more than $25 billion. Gosh, he must be doing something right.
Disney has slumped only in the last two years. Terrorism, threat of
war and recession are enemies of a business that is dependent on
tourism, leisure, and discretionary income, yet Disney's problems are
no greater than those of the general economy.</LD>
<LD>   OCTax shares the Times' concern for Southern California's
entertainment and retail sectors, but probably for different reasons.
Taxpayer reasons. Even in this recession, Disneyland, California
Adventure, Downtown Disney and the Anaheim Angels generate millions
of dollars in taxable sales in Orange County, and employ more than
20,000 tax-paying people. This eases the tax burden on the rest of
us.</LD>
<TE>   There's another indirect tax benefit of Disney's presence in
Orange County. Every year Disney hires thousands of young "cast
members" for its various attractions, many with little experience,
skills or work ethic. Disney teaches them to be well-groomed,
punctual, reliable, poised, courteous and customer-focused. These
young people are well-prepared to enter the general employment
market. At no cost to taxpayers, Disney does more to qualify our
future workers than a dozen government employment programs.</TE>
<TE>   Like The Times, OCTax wants Disney to get back to full speed.
Unlike The Times, OCTax is confident that Disney's management is up
to the task.</TE>
<TE>   Reed L. Royalty</TE>
<TE>   President, OCTax</TE>
<TE>   San Juan Capistrano</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Times may be exaggerating a little when it says that what's
bad for the Walt Disney Co. is bad for Southern California. But the
converse is surely true: when Disney does well, Southern California
(and particularly Orange County) does well. And, recently, things
have gone very well. The Disney-owned Angels are dazzling their fans.
The California Adventure theme park has revitalized the aging
Disneyland Resort area and triggered an Orange County boom in new
hotel construction. And Disney, one of the largest employers in
Orange County, consistently has exemplified the good corporate
citizen, supporting programs in almost every corner of our community.</TE>
<TE>   In any organization, there needs to be constant reinvention and
rethinking, so it is no surprise that Disney is taking steps to
improve its internal governance structure and to improve its
profitability. After 18 years at the helm, it is not surprising that
the focus of any change revolves around Eisner. What is surprising is
the shortsighted view that a downward blip in stock prices in a rough
economic period somehow translates into an editorial suggesting
Disney and Eisner should change course. Absolutely wrong. The role
Disney plays in the Southern California economy (and in Orange
County) has never been more vibrant. The role the company plays in
the community is exceptional. And the man who provided the vision,
and who raised all of our expectations in making his vision very,
very real, is the main reason we should have faith in Disney's
future.</TE>

<LD>Re "Bratton Lays Out Ambitious Set of Goals for LAPD," Oct. 4:</LD>
<LD>   William J. Bratton said graffiti falls under "quality of life." I
agree. Those creating graffiti usually do not have a quality of life.
Most of them were denied middle-class opportunities for success.</LD>
<LD>   Here is where I challenge Bratton. Graffiti marks an individual's
expression of thoughts. Why not turn it into an art fair?</LD>
<TE>   Provide portable blank canvases throughout the city. Establish a
display area for public viewing of finished canvases. Judge the
graffiti and create art scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   I have seen remarkable art disguised as graffiti. Use innovative
ideas for success instead of arrests. Keep replacing the canvases
with blank ones and expect to be surprised by the results.</TE>

<LD>Re: "Rules on Fund Use Eased by D.A.," Oct. 2:</LD>
<LD>   Will the Orange County Board of Supervisors finally rein in Tony
Rackauckas' waste of taxpayer money when he tries to use the $90,000
fund for his political campaign, claiming his reelection is a "matter
of interest" to the office? Or when he tries to take a vacation with
the investigation fund money, claiming his rest and relaxation is a
"matter of interest" to the office?</LD>
<LD>   Probably not. Apparently state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer didn't read
Penal Code section 424 when he said no crimes were committed. That
section makes it a felony to use public money for any purpose not
authorized by law. The grand jury, led by his own deputy attorney
general, detailed many instances where county time, equipment and
resources were expended for purposes not authorized by law. The Times
article proves Rackauckas thinks his power is limitless.</LD>

<HD>Alphonse Chapanis, 85; Professor of Brain Sciences
Pioneered the Field of Ergonomics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alphonse Chapanis, a professor of psychological and brain sciences at
Johns Hopkins University who pioneered the field of ergonomics, has
died. He was 85.</LD>
<LD>   Chapanis, who lived in suburban Towson, Md., died Oct. 4 in a
Baltimore hospital of complications following knee surgery.</LD>
<LD>   Long before the term ergonomics became commonplace with the
proliferation of computers in the workplace, Chapanis began his
research in what was formerly called human engineering. In 1949, he
published the first textbook on the subject, "Applied Experimental
Psychology: Human Factors in Engineering Design."</LD>
<TE>   In 1966, when mainframe computers still filled whole rooms,
Chapanis described his unusual specialty for the Baltimore Sun as a
field "whose business is people: their comfort, their safety, their
efficiency and, finally, their ability to use machines."</TE>
<TE>   "The increasing complexity of machine systems," he said
presciently in that interview 36 years ago, "will continue to raise
more pressing and unique problems of man-machine integration. In the
automatic world of tomorrow, human engineering will be essential."</TE>
<TE>   During the several decades that Chapanis spent developing the
field of man-and-machine interaction, several names were applied to
what he studied -- psychophysical systems research, engineering
psychology, human factors, human engineering and, finally,
ergonomics.</TE>
<TE>   Chapanis got an early start in his work during World War II. With
a new doctorate in psychology from Yale, by 1943 he became an
aviation psychologist at Wright Field and the School of Aviation
Medicine in Texas. He helped teach pilots new techniques in night
attacks against Japanese planes and studied the effects of high
altitudes on psychology and physiology.</TE>
<TE>   He joined Johns Hopkins in 1946, and became a much-loved teacher
and mentor to graduate students. Chapanis also instilled in his
students the need to give customers more than they asked for. In that
mode, when he delivered lectures in Israel or Asia as well as Europe,
Canada and Australia, he frequently gave the speech in the language
of the country where he was speaking.</TE>
<TE>   Chapanis, who officially retired from the university in 1982,
continued his research and consulting until his death. He published
his autobiography, "The Chapanis Chronicles," in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, he served as president of such professional
societies as the Society of Engineering Psychologists and the
International Ergonomics Assn. He earned awards from those groups and
from the American Psychological Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Chapanis is survived by his wife of 11 months, Vivian Woodward
Chapanis; two children; four stepchildren; and seven grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   The family requests that memorial donations be sent to the Nature
Conservancy, the Environmental Protection Agency or any organization
dedicated to breast cancer research.</TE>

<HD>Tooru Kanazawa, 95; Served in Famed WWII Unit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elaine Woo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tooru Joe Kanazawa, a pioneering journalist and novelist who was one
of the oldest members of World War II's legendary Japanese American
fighting unit, the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, died Oct. 2 at his
home in Topanga. He was 95 and had emphysema.</LD>
<LD>   Kanazawa, who grew up in Seattle and Juneau, Alaska, escaped the
World War II detention of 110,000 Japanese Americans in the western
United States when he moved to New York in late 1940 to further his
writing career.</LD>
<LD>   A year later, disturbed by the federal government's mass
internment of Japanese Americans after the attack on Pearl Harbor, he
went to work for the Japanese American Citizens League in Washington,
D.C. As the civil rights group's eastern representative, he advocated
reversing federal policy to allow Japanese Americans to serve in
combat.</LD>
<TE>   More than 3,000 Nisei, or first-generation Japanese Americans,
fought in the 442nd, including several hundred who volunteered from
the internment camps.</TE>
<TE>   Kanazawa was, at 36, one of the oldest volunteers when he joined
the regiment in 1943. He served until 1945, earning a Bronze Star for
meritorious service as a radio operator for the regiment's Cannon
Company.</TE>
<TE>   He was the author of two books: "Close Support, A History of the
Cannon Company of the 442d Regimental Combat Team" and "Sushi and
Sourdough," a novel taught in many Asian American studies courses.</TE>
<TE>   His 1989 novel, completed when Kanazawa was 83, was extensively
autobiographical, offering a glimpse into the insulated world of
Japanese immigrants struggling for a piece of the American dream in
Alaska's salmon canneries during the 1920s. It describes the central
character's conflicts as a Nisei straddling two worlds, who faced
discrimination as well as delicious freedoms on the Alaskan frontier.</TE>
<TE>   "He captured in fiction a piece of our history that is not well
known, and at the same time he talked about the universality of the
immigrant experience," said Phil Tajitsu Nash, who teaches Asian
American studies at the University of Maryland and knew Kanazawa for
40 years. "It's a nuanced book ... not rah-rah America, or America is
unfair to immigrants."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Spokane, Wash., in 1906, he moved with his family to
Alaska when he was 6. They lived in Douglas and later in Juneau,
where his father was a barber.</TE>
<TE>   Kanazawa worked in the canneries as a youth, but dreamed of a life
as a writer. He enrolled at the University of Washington, graduating
in 1931 with a degree in journalism. He sold some stories to the
Christian Science Monitor and a magazine called Thrilling Sports.</TE>
<TE>   But most mainstream newspapers were not interested in hiring
Japanese American reporters. He went to work for the English-language
edition of the Los Angeles newspaper Rafu Shimpo, for which he
covered the 1932 Olympic Games.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a very independent sort of guy. And he had a passion for
writing," said Bill Hosokawa, a former editor of the Denver Post who
has written books about the Nisei. "He wanted to write fiction,
magazine stories. He was writing freelance stuff for dime-novel type
magazines. He was very ambitious and persistent. But his success was
rather limited."</TE>
<TE>   When journalism work was slow, he went back to Juneau and drove a
laundry truck for several years.</TE>
<TE>   He was already living in New York when the Japanese attacked Pearl
Harbor. When the federal government ordered the evacuation of
Japanese Americans from the West Coast, his mother, two sisters and
their children were sent to a relocation camp in Poston, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   His brother died in a detention camp in Lordsburg, N.M. Kanazawa
would later tell his family that his brother's spirit was crushed in
the camp.</TE>
<TE>   Among the rights and responsibilities lost in the national
hysteria over Japanese Americans was military service: The Nisei were
reclassified 4-C, the category reserved for declared, undeclared and
enemy residents. Many of the 5,000 or so Japanese Americans already
in uniform were discharged after Pearl Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   Kanazawa left New York for Washington "because he wanted to do
something about getting Japanese Americans into the Army," said his
daughter, Teru Sheehan of Topanga.</TE>
<TE>   He went to work for Mike Masaoka, then executive secretary of the
Japanese American Citizens League, who led discussions with
congressional and wartime officials over allowing the Nisei to
volunteer for combat.</TE>
<TE>   Some Nisei thought it was the height of lunacy to volunteer to
fight for a government that doubted their loyalty. Others bristled at
the idea of a segregated unit.</TE>
<TE>   Kanazawa believed the segregation was necessary, "both because of
the racism within the ranks and because it was the only way the Nisei
could stand out as being who they were," Sheehan said. "He maintained
they had to prove they were equal to any white soldier."</TE>
<TE>   The 442nd Regimental Combat Team, organized at Camp Shelby in
Mississippi in February 1943, was overwhelmed by volunteers. Masaoka
was the first to join, followed quickly by Kanazawa.</TE>
<TE>   The 442nd helped fight major campaigns in Italy and France and,
with its "Go for Broke" motto, became one of the most decorated
combat units in history.</TE>
<TE>   Kanazawa spent the first part of his tour lugging radio equipment
for Cannon Company. He later was assigned to citation writing.
Acknowledging that "a typewriter was his weapon," he began gathering
notes for a history of his company.</TE>
<TE>   About 40 years later, Kanazawa was attending a Smithsonian exhibit
on the evacuations when he overheard a junior high school student
tell her parents that she had never read about the detention camps in
school, and could not believe the United States would "put its own
people in concentration camps." He decided then that it was time for
him to write the history.</TE>
<TE>   Kanazawa described "Close Support" as a "collective memoir" of
Cannon Company, drawn from interviews with surviving veterans and his
own recollections.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the memories are harsh, such as an anecdote about a
comrade killed during a ferocious battle in the Vosges Mountains in
eastern France. Kanazawa wrote about coming across his grave at the
American cemetery in Epinal, France, and wondering why the soldier
hadn't wanted to be buried back in the States.</TE>
<TE>   He was told that the soldier had spent time in a relocation camp
before joining the 442nd and had been very bitter about it.</TE>
<TE>   The soldier said that if he was killed in combat, "he would be
much happier if he was buried where he fell, because the people of
that country will show him much more respect and appreciation than
the U.S. government, who showed hatred and discrimination by putting
him behind a barbed-wire fence."</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Kanazawa returned to New York and was an executive
in the travel business until his retirement in 1983. He was known as
a political activist, outspoken on issues from women's liberation to
Japanese American reparations, and a lover of classical poetry who
often recited long passages learned when he was boy.</TE>
<TE>   He persisted with writing, even into his 90s, believing that,
through writing, he could broaden cultural understanding.</TE>
<TE>   "He thought the Nisei generation had been really deformed by
racism in the country," his daughter said. "I think that was the
thing he felt he had done something about, through his writing.
People could see he was a fully developed person. I think that is
what excited him the most."</TE>
<TE>   Kanazawa is survived by his wife of 54 years, Mae; daughters Teru
and Joy of Topanga; a son, Mark, of Minnesota; and several
grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Falwell and Co.'s Vitriol Makes for a World of Hurt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Benjamin J. Hubbard</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Consistent with his penchant for false and hurtful speech, the Rev.
Jerry Falwell on Oct. 6 used a CBS "60 Minutes" broadcast to brand
the prophet Muhammad "a terrorist." This puts Falwell in the bigoted
company of fellow TV preacher Pat Robertson, who labeled Muhammad "a
killer" during a Sept. 18 appearance on a Fox News show, and former
Southern Baptist president Jerry Vines, who called the prophet a
"demon-possessed pedophile."</LD>
<LD>   It is true that Muhammad led a Medinan army against his enemies in
Mecca in the name of conquering the city for God/Allah. But it's also
true that he granted his enemies amnesty once the city was in his
hands. A similar religious motivation led Moses to do battle with the
Medianites, Joshua with the Canaanites, Saul with the Philistines and
David with the Jebusites. So, by Falwell's logic, let us add these
biblical figures to the list of terrorist killers. And let them join
St. Bernard of Clairvaux, who preached the Second Crusade and St.
Joan of Arc, that French teen terrorist.</LD>
<LD>   The charge of pedophilia against Muhammad stems apparently from
his marriage to Aishah when she was 16. But according to most Muslim
scholars, they did not live as man and wife until she was 19. If
contemporary standards were used, one has to wonder how many of his
700 wives and 300 concubines King Solomon might have statutorily
raped during his reign.</LD>
<TE>   Not only do the Reverends Falwell, Robertson and Vines lack
historical perspective when they make these vile charges, they foment
religious and racial bigotry. According to a Sept. 16 report from
California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, there was a 15.5% increase in
hate crimes statewide in 2001 sparked largely by the anti-Arab
backlash following the 9/11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Rusty Kennedy, director of the Orange County Human Relations
Commission, said there was a 50% rise in hate crimes in the county in
2001, and that 69 of the 181 total incidents (38%) were directed
against Arabs or Muslims. In 2000, there were just eight
anti-Arab/Muslim hate crimes. Those who commit such acts, Kennedy
said, "are fringe people or criminals who feel empowered by what is
said in the public arena." Similarly, he noted, if people of
conscience stand together against hate, "it influences the fringe."</TE>
<TE>   Not only might Falwell and company's words very likely spark
bigotry in America, they already have caused a riot in India's Jammu
and Kashmir state. After learning of Falwell's comments in a
newspaper article, thousands of Muslims forced shops to close and
overturned vehicles in this tinderbox region of religious and ethnic
tension.</TE>
<TE>   The same kind of ignorance and bigotry that prompted Falwell to
utter his blasphemy against Muhammad and Islam is apparent in the
anti-Semitic -- posing as anti-Israel -- campaign of some elements of
the Arab press. This has included Holocaust denial and variations on
the "blood libel," the charge that Jews use the blood of murdered
Christian children to make matzo for Passover.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Jazirah, a state-run Saudi newspaper, ran an article by
Muhammad bin S'ad Al-Shwey'ir claiming that Jews use the blood of
non-Jewish children to make pastries for the festival of Purim. The
paper's editor later disavowed the article, but the damage had been
done.</TE>
<TE>   In a similar vein, a cartoon in the prominent Greek daily
newspaper Ethnos in April showed two Israeli soldiers stabbing
Palestinians and saying, "Don't feel guilty, brother. We were not in
Auschwitz and Dachau to suffer but to learn." And three mainstream
Greek dailies ran an article supplied to the Athenian News Agency by
a Palestinian organization claiming that Israelis were selling the
organs of dead Palestinian fighters and performing medical
experiments on Arab prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   Evil and ignorant words -- whether directed against a religion, a
racial group or a minority such as gays and lesbians -- have the
power to incite hatred and violence. Falwell and his anti-Muslim ilk,
and the world's anti-Semites, need to consider the spiritual pain and
potential verbal and physical abuse their words can cause to Muslims
or Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Correspondingly, the courageous words and deeds of good people, in
opposing ignorance and hate, have the power to blunt bigotry and mend
the world.</TE>

<HD>Plenty of Lines, but No Limits</HD>
<DH>Society defines us racially, sexually and financially, but
we must find ways to overcome preconceptions and intolerance to grow
as individuals and appreciate one another.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Shadee Malaklou</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At age 5, I had my first brush with intolerance. My next-door
neighbor and I went to kindergarten together. She, let's call her
Susie, became my best friend. As innocent as she was, she had learned
to hate on the basis of race. And at age 5, she manifested this
hatred on me.</LD>
<LD>   Susie taught me many things. Looking back on it all, I wish I
could describe her impact as positive. We played on the monkeybars
together; I gave her my snack sometimes. She invited me to her
birthday parties, and I invited her to mine. Yet the most vivid
memory I have of her is the bitter dissatisfaction she left. I just
wasn't good enough. I was never good enough for her ... unless I
wasn't myself.</LD>
<LD>   Susie insisted that I abandon my Persian heritage and fully adopt
the American culture -- her culture -- and the customs she identified
with. This best friend insisted I stop speaking Farsi and that I no
longer associate with my grandmother because my dear momon-joon wore
a scarf around her head as a symbol of her religious devotion. She
asked that I trade my beloved rice and kabob for such "normal" foods
as hamburgers, pizzas and tuna casseroles, and that I dye my hair
blond so that I could be "beautiful."</LD>
<TE>   So I did ... for as long as I could. But it didn't last long.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back on it all, I am ashamed to admit that I conceded. I
compromised myself in order to be accepted by a girl who,
unfortunately, did not even know how to accept me, or any other
person with a dissimilar background. A decade later, I realized the
foolishness of my actions. My bittersweet awareness can be best
summed up in the words of the band Coldplay: "In my place, in my
place ... were lines that I couldn't change."</TE>
<TE>   These words led to a powerful self-realization: I needed to accept
myself. I needed to accept myself even though others might not. I
wish I could tell you that Susie was the only one, and that my
distraught -- no, burdened -- heart was the result of this incident
alone. I wish I could tell you that I knew nothing else of prejudice
and bigotry. I wish I could tell you that, growing up in the U.S., I
had never stared hatred in the face or felt its presence around the
corner, in my neighborhood or at school, so malevolent and ready to
attack.</TE>
<TE>   The world can be a dreary and unwelcoming place, where people are
lost, hurt, alone ... and racially frustrated; where people let
stereotypes and racial slurs determine who they are, what they stand
for and their significance to others. And though we victims cannot
but take note of their snubs, what we make of their actions is our
choice and our choice alone.</TE>
<TE>   Me? I know that I will never be a Shadee cast to fit society's
status quo; and I know that I am not blond, not beautiful. I was
never like Susie, and am still not.</TE>
<TE>   And today, at age 17, I question my once-ardent desire to mirror
my friend's image. Susie had been insensitive in her vulgar rebuff of
my heritage; and I would never treat a fellow living, breathing,
feeling individual with the same regard.</TE>
<TE>   I ran into that little girl a couple of years ago. We sat together
for a while. Our childhood came up, and I asked her why.... Yes, that
infamous why. In the words of Coldplay, she admitted that she had
been "scared, tired and underprepared" to deal with diversity.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, as mere human beings, we are often scared of what
we don't understand. At age 17, my friend Susie was beginning to
realize the truth expressed in these words, though, sadly, I know
that many others are still in the process of ascertaining that truth.
All of us, regardless of how open-minded we consider ourselves to be,
must push to further liberate our senses and compassion toward the
only race -- the human race; the only sex -- the human sex; and the
only class -- humanity.</TE>
<TE>   As different as we are and as beautiful as those differences may
be, it is the similarities we share that envelop and enthrall us. We
are all of one entity. Our differences make us beautiful, but our
similarities allow us to love.</TE>
<TE>   You see, at age 5, I was incapable of changing these lines that
put me in my place, and at age 17, I am still unable to change them.
But there are certain lines that we do and must cross -- that we do
and must change. Racially, biologically, sexually, financially ... we
are who we are. And these lines that put us in our place? We will
never be able to change them. But as human beings with ideologies and
viewpoints and principles, we are what we make of ourselves.</TE>

<LD>An early-morning traffic stop on the Costa Mesa Freeway was anything
but routine for California Highway Patrol Officer Brad Gardea, who
helped deliver a baby girl inside one car moments after writing a
ticket to the driver of another.</LD>
<LD>   According to the CHP, Gardea had just finished writing the ticket
at 6:50 a.m. Thursday at Katella Avenue when a car parked in front of
his cruiser. Jose Vasquez ran out, speaking in Spanish, which Gardea
does not understand. But Gardea quickly realized Vasquez was saying
his passenger, Maria Isabel de Rosas, was in labor.</LD>
<LD>   The pair was en route to a Garden Grove hospital. Gardea helped
deliver a 5-pound girl who was about three weeks early.</LD>

<LD>An Oxnard couple and their friend have been arrested on suspicion of
possessing more than 2 pounds of cocaine and methamphetamine valued
by authorities at $30,000, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Isabel Warren, 35, was being held in lieu of $2-million bail and
her husband, Darryl, 27, in lieu of $250,000 bail. Juan Ocampo, 49,
of Oxnard was freed after posting a $50,000 bond.</LD>
<LD>   After a month of surveillance, Oxnard police officers last week
raided the Warrens' home, seizing a pound each of cocaine and
methamphetamine. Five more ounces of methamphetamine were found in a
car being used by Darryl Warren and Ocampo, and 2 ounces of cocaine
were found at Ocampo's home, police said. A combined $21,000 in
suspected drug proceeds was also seized.</LD>

<HD>Transfer Plan Could Uproot FFA Programs</HD>
<DH>Returning agricultural education consultants to Sacramento
may lead to demise of high school Future Farmers clubs, critics say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Fred Alvarez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State educators are shutting down regional offices that support high
school agricultural education programs, a move that some fear could
cause farm-based curriculum and activities at campuses across
California to wither or die.</LD>
<LD>   Officials with the state Department of Education notified workers
at four regional offices last month that they would be reassigned to
Sacramento to make up for staff shortages brought on by budget cuts.</LD>
<LD>   Those offices--on university campuses in Chico, Fresno, San Luis
Obispo and Pomona--house employees who for years have worked with
state high schools, coordinating regional contests, leadership
conferences and other activities on behalf of agricultural education
programs and Future Farmers of America chapters.</LD>
<TE>   State education officials say those employees will continue that
work in Sacramento, while taking on additional duties. But the
department has been deluged by phone calls, e-mails and letters of
protest from more than 1,000 students, teachers and farm industry
officials. Critics argue that the quality of existing programs will
suffer if the regional coordinators are not in the field. They
question whether the move will result in the desired cost savings,
because the positions are federally funded and not tied to the state
budget.</TE>
<TE>   And they fear potential long-term effects, warning that the move
could result in fewer opportunities for students to learn about
agriculture, in turn reducing interest in the subject and leading to
the demise of campus programs statewide.</TE>
<TE>   "It runs the risk of destroying California FFA and agricultural
education in general," said Ventura High School agriculture teacher
Amy Lewandoski.</TE>
<TE>   Education officials say they are not backing away from their
commitment to agricultural education or other programs that fall
under the department's vocational education banner.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Ainsworth, assistant superintendent for the division that
oversees such programs, said the department was forced to close the
regional offices and reassign personnel in response to the loss of
100 positions this fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   Ainsworth's division lost 12 positions as a result of budget cuts
and a hiring freeze. In addition, he said, five other staff members
were reassigned to a new, state-mandated initiative aimed at boosting
the academic performance of high school students.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really getting to the point around here where we didn't
have enough bodies to complete the fundamental work of the
department," Ainsworth said.</TE>
<TE>   Employees who had been working in agricultural education will
continue to do so, although they may have to rely more on phone calls
or e-mails to get the job done.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand the concern: It comes from having a system that has
been developed over many years and that people believe is working and
want to see continue," Ainsworth said. "But I would find it hard to
believe that the relocation of four individuals will cause the
collapse of that system."</TE>
<TE>   The regional consultants say they have not been told what their
new duties will be or how much time they will have for agricultural
education.</TE>
<TE>   For the last few years, Jack Havens has coordinated activities for
about 13,000 agricultural students in a region that stretches from
the high desert cities above Lancaster to the dusty towns along the
Mexican border.</TE>
<TE>   Stationed at Cal Poly Pomona, Havens said he has been able to draw
on university resources to stage teacher workshops and other
professional development activities.</TE>
<TE>   He has also been able to visit the dozens of schools with
agricultural programs in that area, allowing him to help develop
curriculum and provide hands-on technical support.</TE>
<TE>   Havens said that while he expects to continue those efforts to
some degree, it would be wrong to think that the same quality of work
can be done from 400 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   "It's absolutely a mistake," Havens said. "If you are going to
improve schools, you don't do it by sitting in a cubicle in
Sacramento. You have to be out in the schools working with teachers
and students."</TE>
<TE>   Havens and others say the lessons of agricultural education extend
well beyond teaching youngsters how to raise animals or grow crops.
Students develop leadership skills and public speaking techniques.
They learn the value of agriculture to the state and the nation,
while exploring careers in the rapidly expanding agribusiness
industry.</TE>
<TE>   With agriculture's increased reliance on technology and research,
such exploration provides a base for pursuing not only farm-related
jobs but also a range of other careers.</TE>
<TE>   Future Farmers, established in 1928, is the largest student
organization in California, representatives say, serving 56,000
students on 307 high school campuses statewide. It's also one of the
state's fastest-growing student organizations, and has increased by
as many as 3,000 members a year for the last half a dozen years.</TE>
<TE>   Regional consultants have played a key role in that growth.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't see any advantage for ag education in this move," said
Ken Harris, who for 10 years has overseen agricultural education for
about 14,000 students in the Central Valley. "I don't understand how
I am going to continue doing my duties while adding six hours and 360
miles of travel time to every activity."</TE>
<TE>   As it stands, the regional consultants are cleaning out their
offices to be in Sacramento on Nov. 4.</TE>
<TE>   But boosters of the farm-based programs are hoping that a pending
change in administration at the education department will result in a
change of heart on the subject.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 5, voters will choose between state Sen. Jack O'Connell
(D-Santa Barbara) and Katherine Smith, a Republican from Orange
County, to replace Supt. of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin, who is
ending her second and final term.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell declined to comment on the issue. Smith, a member of the
Anaheim Union School District board, called agricultural education a
valuable program that deserves to be safeguarded and said she would
reverse the department's action if elected.</TE>
<TE>   That is of little immediate comfort to those worried that the
transfer of the regional consultants will leave hundreds of
individual Future Farmers chapters without leadership or
coordination.</TE>
<TE>   At Ventura High School, one of four high school-based agricultural
education programs in Ventura County, Future Farmers students worry
that the move could be the first step toward eliminating the regional
consultants altogether. Camarillo, Santa Paula and Fillmore high
schools also have chapters.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like taking the middle out of the whole program,"
said senior Quinn Fox, 18, the school's Future Farmers president and
one of nearly 200 students enrolled in agricultural education
programs at the Ventura campus.</TE>

<HD>Angels' Media Chief at Top of His Game</HD>
<DH>Team communications executive Tim Mead isn't accustomed to
working October playoff games. This year he's swamped and loving it.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>October used to be pretty predictable for Tim Mead, the Anaheim
Angels vice president of communications. With the team done for the
year, his 14-hour days would be over. The phones would have stopped
ringing. He could leave the office for lunch.</LD>
<LD>   This October is just a little different.</LD>
<LD>   For the first time in 16 years the team is in the playoffs and,
for the first time ever, the Angels have advanced beyond the first
round of postseason play to have a real shot at winning it all.</LD>
<TE>   That makes the Angels the hottest ticket in town. Movie stars are
scrambling for seats. Reporters from as far as Puerto Rico, Ecuador
and Japan want credentials.</TE>
<TE>   Mead, 44, and his small staff are at the center of it all. "It's
about us, not me," he says. Moving quicker than a Troy Percival
fastball, he is the man who gets things done.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   His mornings start with no schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "You come in here with projects, but the phone and the people and
the e-mail dictate what we do," Mead said.</TE>
<TE>   This is Friday, the day of the team's first home game in its
series against the Minnesota Twins. He's busy--the phone is ringing
in the background, the e-mail alert keeps dinging, people are
hovering outside his office--but he takes time to chat with each of
them: "It's great for this area. It's great for this fan base. It's a
great story line."</TE>
<TE>   The minutes play out in a series of crises that arise and are
resolved in hurried conversations. It's not easy for an outsider to
even understand the problem before it appears to go away.</TE>
<TE>   11:09 a.m. -- Administrative assistant Trish Pene rushes into his
office. "Did we order food for Percival and Anderson last time?" she
asks.</TE>
<TE>   He's not sure.</TE>
<TE>   Mead turns to his trusty hand-held computer--"lose that and I'd be
in a world of hurt"--and sifts through about 1,400 numbers. He picks
up the phone and dials.</TE>
<TE>   "Troy? Mr. Mead here. No, nothing's wrong. Nothing's going on.
Does Michelle want food service in the suite? OK. See you here."</TE>
<TE>   Problem solved.</TE>
<TE>   11:40 a.m. -- He doles out baseballs autographed by Tim Salmon and
Garret Anderson that are kept under lock and key. Community Relations
Director Matt Bennett needs them for a high school fund-raiser. The
Angels are hot. The baseball supply is low. "You know what? Both
Troys will sign more," Mead tells Bennett, referring to Percival and
third baseman Troy Glaus.</TE>
<TE>   Problem averted.</TE>
<TE>   11:52 a.m. -- Associated Press is looking for celebrities who will
be attending the games. Mead asks around. One of his deputies, Nancy
Mazmanian, mentions a few. Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit. Matt LeBlanc.
Pierce Brosnan.</TE>
<TE>   Question answered.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mead, a Cal Poly Pomona grad who lives in Diamond Bar with his
wife and son, started with the Angels as a public relations intern in
1980, when he answered phones, stuffed envelopes and photocopied
lineups before rising through the ranks in the team's front office.
Now he and his colleagues are having a season they used to just dream
about.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the problems and the answers on Friday, he takes time out to
leave a message with a friend at the San Francisco Giants, assistant
general manager Ned Colletti, whose team is also in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted to congratulate you on getting off to a 2-0 start.
Slow down and let us catch up here."</TE>
<TE>   He can't help adding: "We'll see you next week."</TE>
<TE>   A little later, just after noon, Mead walks to the ticket office.
He strides through the stadium and waves, it seems, at every fifth
person. He knows each by name. "If I walk too fast, I'm sorry," Mead
said. He doesn't slow down.</TE>
<TE>   The pace continues throughout the day. He sets up interviews for
Manager Mike Scioscia. Meets with the networks to finalize broadcast
plans. Fields questions from reporters.</TE>
<TE>   An hour before game time, he greets Hall of Famer Rod Carew, who
played for the Angels and Twins. Carew threw out the first pitch
Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   "Ready? Loose?" he asks Carew. They have 59 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   He ushers Carew to a holding room after being approached by a
reporter in the elevator and another in the hallway. Carew wants to
sit tight.</TE>
<TE>   Mead leaves to find a new baseball for Carew. He chats with Jose
Molina, preps him for catching the first pitch. He plays conspirator
with bench coach Joe Maddon, who corrals Mead and demands to know,
"Is he here? Where is he?"</TE>
<TE>   They find Carew, drag him to the dugout. The players love him. He
gives them a pep talk, high fives and hugs. Mead smiles.</TE>
<TE>   "What's really great is the connection between this team and the
past," Mead said. "Former players are pulling for this team. It's
awesome."</TE>
<TE>   Mead looks nervously at his watch. "Where are they?" he said. A
few seconds later, four military aircraft fly over Edison
International Field.</TE>
<TE>   Clockwork.</TE>
<TE>   Carew throws out the first pitch with perfect form. The crowd
cheers.</TE>
<TE>   The game starts, and still, there is no rest for Mead. He drops by
the luxury suite, says hi to the top brass. Wait, they ask, can you
walk Kevin Costner's wife to her car?</TE>
<TE>   He takes her down back staircases, through the stadium maze, out
the gates and into the jammed parking lot to retrieve something from
her car. Another problem solved.</TE>
<TE>   Hours later, long after the last out is made, Mead heads to the
parking lot again. This time it's empty.</TE>
<TE>   He skips the post-game party. His bed seems more inviting.</TE>
<TE>   The workday is over 14 hours after it began. Reporters have filed
their stories for the night.</TE>
<TE>   Life is good. The Angels are up.</TE>
<TE>   "Sleep?" Mead asks. "We'll sleep in November."</TE>

<HD>Marin's High Breast Cancer Rate to Be Studied</HD>
<DH>Some speculate an affluent, educated lifestyle may provide
clues. But there is no 'smoking gun,' a researcher says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michelle Munn</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>SAN RAFAEL</DL>
<LD>Four national health agencies will soon try to answer a question that
has mystified Marin County residents for years: Why does this
community have what appears to be one of the highest rates of breast
cancer in the nation?</LD>
<LD>   At a meeting with county health experts last week, federal
officials confirmed plans for a joint investigation, drawing on
researchers from the National Cancer Institute, the National
Institute of the Environmental Health Sciences, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services.</LD>
<LD>   Marin's rate of 223 breast cancers per 100,000 people is sharply
higher than the national rate of about 140.</LD>
<TE>   "One needs to look broadly at all the risk factors to see what
might be causing these alarming incidence rates," Carl Barrett,
director of the National Cancer Institute's Center for Cancer
Research, said in an interview Friday. "But we don't come with any
preconceived conclusions."</TE>
<TE>   Barrett said researchers will first organize meetings to analyze
the Marin data, and then figure out what additional research is
necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Some scientists believe the high rate lies at least partly in the
socioeconomic factors that are characteristic of Marin. The county is
extremely wealthy, with a per capita income more than 200% of the
U.S. average. Forty-four percent of its adults hold at least a
bachelor's degree. BMWs and Volvos dot the driveways of $600,000
homes. Residents shop at organic groceries and run along the shores
of the Pacific Ocean to the west, and San Francisco Bay to the east.</TE>
<TE>   These factors would seem to have little relation to a disease that
strikes one in eight women nationally. But it's exactly the attendant
perks and habits of such a lifestyle--bearing fewer children, having
them later in life, using fertility drugs to conceive them, or taking
estrogen and other hormones to alleviate the onset of menopause--that
may trigger cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Olden, a director of the Institute of Environmental Health
Sciences, attended last week's meeting in Marin: "There was no
smoking gun. I didn't hear anyone talk about a hazardous waste
facility nearby or some other environmental thing," said Olden, a
specialist on cancer cell transmission in the body.</TE>
<TE>   "People in Marin are very health-conscious," Olden said. "They
take physical therapy. They take natural products. But just because
something is natural doesn't mean it isn't carcinogenic."</TE>
<TE>   Christina Clarke, an epidemiologist with the Northern California
Cancer Center, co-wrote a study published in July on the Marin breast
cancer rates.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a high distribution of risk factors," Clarke said, "like
delayed childbirth, hormone replacement therapy. These things cluster
in affluent, educated women."</TE>
<TE>   Clarke and a team of doctors and professionals at UC San
Francisco, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and the county
health department found that the breast cancer rate for white,
non-Latina women increased 37% from 1990 to 1999 in Marin, but
remained flat in the rest of the Bay Area and in California's other
urban counties. (The researchers looked at white, non-Latina women
because fewer than 10 cases of breast cancer are annually found in
Latinos, blacks or other populations of color in Marin, which is 80%
white.)</TE>
<TE>   Even when compared with other affluent or urban areas in
California, Marin's rates still indicate what Clarke and other
scientists called "true" anomalies. Marin women aren't any likelier
than other women to get mammograms, which often detect breast cancer
at an early stage. So the breast cancer pattern in Marin--where
early-stage cancer rates are sky-high, but advanced cancer rates are
not any lower--suggests that cases of early detection aren't
supplanting later-stage cases. And Marin's breast cancer mortality
rates are decreasing more slowly than those in other parts of the
state, despite women's access to quality health care.</TE>
<TE>   "You have so many variables, so little understanding, and so much
fear in Marin," said Larry Meredith, director of the county
Department of Health and Human Services. "Marin County women are
concerned about when, not if, it will occur. That's what is
traumatizing to the community. So we're looking for the silver
bullet."</TE>
<TE>   In the next week or two, county health officials and experts with
the CDC will plot the geographical distribution of breast cancer
cases in the county. But Meredith cautions that a draft map shows the
rates evenly distributed. He said this blunts easy "smoking-gun"
explanations, which a cancer cluster in the immediate environment
might have suggested.</TE>

<HD>Ventura County Bridge Project to Test Caltrans Engineers'
Metal</HD>
<DH>Team will be overseeing first use of a new type of steel
piling in the widening of the Santa Clara River span.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amanda Covarrubias</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A commuter's nightmare can be an engineer's dream.</LD>
<LD>   Dan Freeman and Dragan Buha know they're working on a project--the
$100-million widening of the Santa Clara River bridge--whose size and
scope comes around only once or twice in a career.</LD>
<LD>   And the two are enjoying every minute of it.</LD>
<TE>   "We're engineers," Freeman said. "This is exciting."</TE>
<TE>   Buha, 43, who lives in Agoura Hills, and Freeman 48, of Lakewood
have a combined 28 years with Caltrans, working on highways
throughout Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   They didn't have to compete for the job. It came to them
automatically as top engineers in Caltrans District 7, which covers
Ventura County and part of northern Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Poring over bound diagrams and reams of figures outlining the
projects' cost, Buha, a senior engineer, quietly directs the project
from a Caltrans office in Thousand Oaks. Although his
responsibilities have largely kept him confined to the office until
now, he'll spend more time at the site as work on the bridge
intensifies.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman oversees the operation, as well as other highway projects
in the district, from a Caltrans office in Los Angeles. His title may
be area manager, but he'll always be an engineer at heart, he said.</TE>
<TE>   He rattles off a long list of Southern California roads he has
worked on, including the Century Freeway near Los Angeles
International Airport, the interchange of the Century and Harbor
freeways, the widening of the Harbor Freeway, and the Artesia Freeway
in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman, who has a desk job, said he envies Buha's opportunity to
oversee the massive project.</TE>
<TE>   "If I was still a senior engineer, I'd want to be doing what he's
doing," Freeman said, smiling at his colleague in the Thousand Oaks
field office.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Clara River bridge project holds a special significance
for Freeman and Buha because Caltrans will be testing a new,
high-capacity piling system that promises to drive bigger piles into
the ground to hold up bridges.</TE>
<TE>   If it works, fewer steel pilings will be needed to support bridges
subject to severe scouring, or erosion. Eventually, it could save
taxpayers millions of dollars and months of construction, Caltrans
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   It will be tested for the first time in Ventura County. The system
is designed to carry up to 8 million pounds and drive piles 6 to 7
feet in diameter into the earth.</TE>
<TE>   Buha and Freeman are working closely with primary contractors MCM
Construction, based in Sacramento, and Security Paving in Sun Valley.</TE>
<TE>   With Ventura County's population growing and subdivisions popping
up all over, traffic is big news.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County supervisors recently agreed to explore forming a
regional traffic authority to deal with traffic problems on the
Ventura Freeway, and Caltrans and the Ventura and Los Angeles county
transportation agencies are completing a $4.5-million study of the
freeway from Thousand Oaks to downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   What they already know is that the number of cars traveling over
the bridge where Oxnard meets Ventura is growing.</TE>
<TE>   The figure rose from 126,000 a day in 1990 to 163,000 in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   It's expected to climb to 192,000 by 2020.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone driving over the bridge now can see cranes looming skyward
from the construction staging area and enormous pilings stacked
nearby as crews prepare to sink them into the ground.</TE>
<TE>   It will take 64,000 cubic meters of concrete and 15 million pounds
of steel to create the new bridge, Buha said.</TE>
<TE>   During construction, all lanes of the Ventura Freeway will stay
open during peak commuter hours, and a large chunk of the work will
be done at night, the engineers said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to minimize the effect on traffic, which is why the
project takes so long," Freeman said. "But there will be some
inconvenience."</TE>

<TE>   And it won't be just any ho-hum bridge. With input from local
transportation people, Caltrans designers came up with a fish motif
for the sloped paving along the bridge's walls, intended to lend a
coastal flair to the structure.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the project's magnitude, Caltrans is making a special
effort to inform the public each step of the way, Freeman said. It's

<HD>L.A. Lags Behind Largest U.S. Cities in Basic Services</HD>
<DH>Poor rankings give Valley, Hollywood secession supporters
more ammunition.</DH>
<SE>First in a series analyzing Los Angeles city services.</SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About This Series</LD>
<LD>   Today, The Times begins a series on Los Angeles city services.
Today's story compares Los Angeles with other major American cities.
Stories later this week will look at the city's record with respect
to potholes, planning, street signs and fire and police services.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles trails the other four largest U.S. cities in key
measurements of many municipal services, including police and fire
protection, a record that secessionists say boosts their cause as
residents prepare to vote on the breakaway measures for the San
Fernando Valley and Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   In their campaign to defeat secession on the Nov. 5 ballot, Mayor
James K. Hahn and other city officials have warned that a municipal
breakup would lead to financial problems and possible cuts in
services for the Valley and Hollywood, as well as the remainder of
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   They say Los Angeles, as a large city taking advantage of the
"economies of scale," can deliver services at a higher quality and
lower cost than three smaller cities could.</TE>
<TE>   But in rankings of the five biggest cities, Los Angeles is less
efficient at delivering certain basic services in categories such as
emergency response times for police officers and spending per capita
on library materials, a Times review has found.</TE>
<TE>   The comparisons are not exact, because the unique characteristics
of each city -- from its physical size to the age of its
infrastructure to the local weather -- can affect the cost and
quality of services.</TE>
<TE>   Taxes also vary among the cities.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, Proposition 13 severely limits increases in
property taxes, a prime source of revenue. Other taxes are so
variable -- within Los Angeles, residents in different areas pay
different taxes, depending on special assessment districts and other
factors -- that it is impossible to meaningfully compare tax burdens
among residents here with those of other big cities.</TE>
<TE>   Those factors aside, in many areas Los Angeles ranks at or near
the bottom in matchups with New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and
Houston. For this survey, The Times analyzed police, fire, library,
street resurfacing and parks -- five services provided by each of the
big cities and studied by academics and others.</TE>
<TE>   Consider:</TE>
<TE>   * Los Angeles has fewer police officers per capita than the other
four cities. It also has the slowest response time among those police
departments.</TE>
<TE>   * Los Angeles has the smallest number of firefighters per capita.
Its response time for fires is worse than New York's but better than
Houston's. Chicago does not track response times and Philadelphia's
record is better than L.A.'s by one standard and worse by another.</TE>
<TE>   * Los Angeles has the smallest number of branch libraries per
capita and spends less on library services and materials per capita
than do the other cities.</TE>
<TE>   * Los Angeles resurfaces a smaller percentage of its streets each
year than do New York, Chicago and Philadelphia. Houston is last in
this category.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists blame L.A.'s poor showing in part on a weighted-down
bureaucracy and a remote City Council, whose 15 members represent
about 240,000 people each, by far the largest number for any city
council in the nation. It also galls breakup advocates that L.A.
council members are the best paid in America, with an annual salary
of $136,000.</TE>
<TE>   "This is part and parcel of money going to a bloated bureaucratic
structure rather than being spent on direct services to the public,"
said state Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge), a candidate for
mayor of the proposed Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   Richman and other secessionists say splitting Los Angeles into
three cities will eliminate most inefficiencies, and allow the
Valley, Hollywood and the remainder of Los Angeles to increase
services.</TE>
<TE>   "You cut out the fat right off the top and that money could go to
public safety," said Carlos Ferreyra, co-chair of the Valley
Independence Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn acknowledged that Los Angeles lags behind other major cities
in some categories but said secession would only deepen the problem
by spreading money and employees even thinner.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said he has taken steps to turn things around, most
notably by hiring former New York City Police Commissioner William
Bratton as police chief and setting aside money to expand the police
force, Fire Department and street resurfacing program.</TE>
<TE>   "I know we need to have more, but to divide us, that's going to
hurt everybody on both sides of the line," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles already is doing some things better than other big
cities, according to a 2001 study by the Reason Foundation, a
conservative think tank. The foundation was critical of Los Angeles
overall but praised the municipal parks system and the city's
performance in building maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   The city has 4.2 acres of parkland per 1,000 residents, more than
Chicago and New York, but less than Philadelphia and Houston, which
has 10 acres per 1,000 people, according to the nonprofit Trust for
Public Land.</TE>
<TE>   The National Recreation and Park Assn. recommends 6.25 to 10.5
acres of parkland per 1,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   Adrian Moore, vice president of research for the foundation, said
Los Angeles spends a higher percentage of its budget on social
service programs than do other cities, leaving police and fire
services wanting.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation study last year found Los Angeles to be the least
efficient of 44 large U.S. cities in providing basic services, mostly
because of poor police services.</TE>
<TE>   Longest Response Time</TE>
<TE>   In a follow-up study this year that looked at 10 California
cities, Los Angeles ranked seventh in efficiency. The studies
indicate that Los Angeles is one of the most underpoliced big cities
in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles has 9,025 officers, one for every 409 residents. Its
citywide average response time to emergencies is 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The other four largest cities have better numbers:</TE>
<TE>   * New York City has 38,000 officers, one for every 209 residents.
Its average response time is about 6 minutes, 8 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   * Houston has 5,200 officers, one per 375 residents, and an
average response time of just under 5 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   * Chicago has 13,643 officers, one for every 212 residents. It
does not calculate response times.</TE>
<TE>   * Philadelphia has 6,900 officers, one for every 219 residents.
Its average emergency response time is 5 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley is patrolled by 1,500 officers, but the revenues
generated by the area entitle it to more than 2,000 officers,
according to Richman.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the Valley receives the benefit of some citywide Los
Angeles Police Department units -- SWAT teams, for instance, as well
as helicopter units, canine units and others -- that are not based in
the Valley but are deployed there when needed.</TE>
<TE>   Secession leaders say the city has failed year after year to solve
the LAPD's problems, which have resulted in a department that is
1,000 officers below what it was in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   They say low officer morale, scandals resulting from sloppy
oversight and the resulting attrition and recruitment difficulties
show no signs of abating.</TE>
<TE>   "The city has not created the kind of relationship with LAPD
officers that would make officers want to stay with the department,"
Ferreyra said.</TE>
<TE>   A new Valley city, where council members would be paid $12,000 a
year and operate a leaner bureaucracy, would be able to spend more on
public safety, Ferreyra said.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said he already has taken steps to boost the police force,
besides Bratton's hiring. The mayor has granted officers' demands for
a compressed workweek, which he said will improve morale and make
recruitment easier.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor also has earmarked money to add 585 officers this year.
He said secession would slow reforms by forcing the LAPD to divide
its resources among the new cities, which would have the option of
contracting with Los Angeles for police protection.</TE>
<TE>   A breakup also would deny the Valley and Hollywood the extra
staffing that a big police department offers in major crime
emergencies and disasters, Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor made the same argument for the Los Angeles Fire
Department, noting that fire engines from other parts of the city
have been periodically redeployed to the Valley to watch over
hillsides in brush-fire season.</TE>
<TE>   "If you start dividing us, you aren't going to be able to do
that," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles has 3,346 firefighters and paramedics, one for every
1,104 residents, the worst ratio of the five largest cities. L.A.
firefighters also take slightly more than 5 minutes on average to
respond to a blaze.</TE>
<TE>   New York's 11,000 firefighters, one for every 728 residents, are
able to get to fires, on average, in 4 minutes, 16 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Houston and Philadelphia report response times differently, from
the time the fire engine is dispatched until it arrives, rather than
from the time a 911 call is logged.</TE>
<TE>   Houston has 3,345 firefighters, one for every 584 residents.
Officials said once an engine company gets the address for a fire, it
takes 1 minute, 47 seconds to arrive at the scene, compared with 3
minutes for Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   However, Los Angeles fire officials said their record is better
than Houston's when responses are measured from the time of the 911
call.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia has 1,891 firefighters, one for every 802 residents.
That city takes longer than the LAFD to respond to fires once trucks
are dispatched, records indicate.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan Blamed</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles firefighters union President Ken Buzzell said a study
by his union several years ago found Los Angeles ranked 29th among
the 30 largest U.S. cities in staffing per capita.</TE>
<TE>   Buzzell accused former Mayor Richard Riordan of "laying waste" to
the Fire Department budgets during the 1990s in favor of the LAPD.
Riordan did not return calls for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Buzzell opposes secession, saying a breakup would require a
Valley city to duplicate the department's bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   "The city of Los Angeles has to make a commitment to put more
resources where we need them," Buzzell said of the solution. "The
understaffing is a serious problem."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor increased the Fire Department budget by 5% this year.
That will pay for 72 more firefighters and paramedics as part of a
long-term plan to steadily expand the ranks.</TE>
<TE>   More money also has gone into street resurfacing. In 1996, the
city resurfaced 150 miles of streets. This year, the budget calls for
260 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles is resurfacing 4% of its streets this year, less than
half the percentage in New York, where the harsher weather makes the
problem more severe. Los Angeles leads only Houston in that category.</TE>
<TE>   And Los Angeles places last among the five biggest cities in
libraries and library spending, according to a recent report by the
American Library Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles has 68 branches, or one for every 54,335 people, and
spends $16.22 per capita on library services, the association said.</TE>
<TE>   New York has one branch for every 39,000 people and spends double
what Los Angeles spends per capita.</TE>
<TE>   However, Los Angeles officials say the figures do not tell the
whole story.</TE>
<TE>   Because Los Angeles voters approved library bond measures in 1989
and 1998, the city is preparing to double library space and replace
aging branches. It will have 72 branches by 2004, many with updated
materials, according to Peter Persic, a library spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   But secessionists remain unimpressed.</TE>
<TE>   "We can do better," Ferreyra said.</TE>

<HD>Fullerton Police Can Be Sued Over Death, Court Says</HD>
<DH>Ruling allows woman to refile lawsuit alleging a cover-up
after husband died in police custody.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.G. Reza</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An appeals court has ruled that Fullerton police can be sued for
allegedly covering up key evidence when a combative man under the
influence of cocaine died in their custody.</LD>
<LD>   The California Court of Appeal, 4th Appellate District, did not
find that police covered up the death of Max Leyza Garcia. Instead,
judges reversed a trial court's decision that Garcia's widow, Rita
Garcia, waited too long to sue, alleging a cover-up.</LD>
<LD>   The decision means she can refile her lawsuit alleging that
Fullerton police were responsible for her husband's death and that
they covered up the fact that he was hogtied after his arrest.</LD>
<TE>   Rita Garcia alleges that for almost two years police withheld
information showing that her husband had been hogtied. She said in
court papers that he died from asphyxiation when police placed him on
his stomach in the back of a police cruiser with his arms handcuffed
behind his back and a rope tied around his feet and secured to the
handcuffs. An autopsy said Garcia's death resulted from "acute
cocaine intoxication" Nov. 2, 1991, after he was arrested at a hotel
where he was causing a disturbance. The report did not say Garcia had
been hogtied.</TE>
<TE>   The man had fought with officers, who restrained him and took him
to Fullerton City Jail. When Garcia was removed from a police
cruiser, officers found he was not breathing.</TE>
<TE>   Police were cleared of any wrongdoing in an investigation by the
district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   But Rita Garcia sued Chief Patrick E. McKinley, his predecessor,
Philip Goehring, Sgt. Joseph Klein and the city in 1996, alleging
police knew the hogtying led to Max Garcia's death, and they hid this
from her.</TE>
<TE>   Court documents show that she repeatedly asked police for records
about her husband's arrest but that her requests were denied. It was
not until she hired an attorney in 1993 that McKinley revealed that
Max Garcia had been restrained by police. After further prodding,
McKinley revealed in July 1993, that the man had been hogtied.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, a jury cleared police and the city of negligence in
Garcia's death in a wrongful death lawsuit filed by Rita Garcia.
Police were also cleared of using excessive force. But before the
trial, the judge had ruled she could not use the cover-up claim
because it had not been filed in the time prescribed by law.</TE>
<TE>   However, the appellate court ruled that Rita Garcia should have
been allowed to use the cover-up argument in pursuing the wrongful
death lawsuit because there is evidence that police kept details of
her husband's arrest from her.</TE>
<TE>   By law, she had to have filed a claim within six months of her
husband's death. But her attorney, Donald W. Cook, said that because
police failed to disclose crucial evidence about the arrest, she was
forced to wait 20 months before filing.</TE>

<HD>Brothers Dele, Dabord Mourned</HD>
<DH>Three deaths in the South Pacific, one in California leave
relatives and friends uncertain but critical of media portrayals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lance Pugmire</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the memorial service Saturday for former NBA player Bison Dele and
his brother, Miles Dabord, family and friends emphasized their bond,
mourned their endings and sought "some sort of closure, even though
there may never be anything closed."</LD>
<LD>   The Rev. Eugene Marzette Sr., a cousin of the brothers, criticized
some media portrayals of Dabord in his eulogy. Dabord, 35, is
considered the primary suspect in the South Pacific deaths of Dele,
33, his girlfriend, Serena Karlan, and Bertrand Saldo, the French
captain of Dele's boat.</LD>
<LD>   "We cannot judge a person's entirety by the sum total of one
event," Marzette told the estimated 200 people at the two-hour
service at Trinity Baptist Church in West Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Dabord died Sept. 27 in a Chula Vista hospital after being removed
from life support equipment. The brothers' mother, Patricia Phillips,
said Dabord had attempted suicide nearly two weeks earlier by
overdosing on insulin and not taking his asthma medication.</TE>
<TE>   Between the July 7 disappearances of Dele, Karlan and Saldo and
Dabord's Sept. 15 comatose arrival at the hospital, Dabord tried to
buy $152,000 in gold coins, using Dele's identity. Dabord also told
his former girlfriend that the three had died on the boat as the
result of a fight started by Dele. French and FBI investigators have
expressed doubt about Dabord's account.</TE>
<TE>   Leondre Harris, a Fresno policeman and first cousin of Dele and
Dabord, said he was angered by a media description of Dabord and Dele
as a modern Cain and Abel -- the implication being that Dabord was a
jealous brother who premeditated the murders.</TE>
<TE>   "They were guys of many talents who loved each other dearly,"
Harris said during the service.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Harris spoke of his frustration about not knowing
exactly what had happened between his cousins, originally called
Brian Williams (Dele) and Kevin Williams (Dabord).</TE>
<TE>   "Being in the field I'm in, I've searched for a logical
explanation," Harris said.</TE>

<HD>Pet Adoption Made Easier by Volunteers at Rescue Web Site</HD>
<DH>Animal Match offers online photos and descriptions of
hundreds of animals at shelters in Southern and Central California.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claire Luna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The plaintive barks and rows of pleading eyes had become too much for
Mechelle Dondo.</LD>
<LD>   She wanted to adopt a dog, but the chaos and gloom of the pounds
near her Hollywood home made it impossible for her to choose one.</LD>
<LD>   But after finding Animal Match Rescue Team's Web site, an Internet
showcase for hundreds of animals at shelters in Southern and Central
California, she saw a Jack Russell mix with big brown doe eyes at the
East Valley Shelter -- and she was sold.</LD>
<TE>   Dondo, 34, and Niblet have now lived together for five months, and
she credits the Web site with bringing them together.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I would have chosen her, even if I had happened to
go to that shelter," Dondo said. "When you're looking in every cage,
the sadness starts overwhelming you to the point you can't see an
individual dog's personality."</TE>
<TE>   The site has been running for three years, powered by about 200
volunteers who cart digital cameras and notebooks nearly every week
to shelters from Fresno to San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   They post photos and descriptions of the animals on www.amrt.net,
hoping to reach would-be pet owners who are either skittish about
shelters or want a more efficient way to find a pet to adopt.</TE>
<TE>   The animals' pictures often capture their personalities, like the
stocky Chihuahua who glared into the lens or the skinny yellow
Labrador mix who cocked his head at the camera, a long pink tongue
lolling out of his mouth.</TE>
<TE>   The descriptions range from facts about age, weight and date of
availability, to snappy narratives about each animal, such as a
90-pound shepherd mix at the Camarillo shelter characterized as a
"big, silly, happy-go-lucky goofball. He wants attention and was
standing on the bars, looking for a friend."</TE>
<TE>   "Shelters are sad places," said Laura Beth Heisen of Reseda, who
has worked with the Web site since its creation. "But the Web site
gives people the courage to go inside because they've already fallen
in love with a face and know they're going to walk out with an animal
they've saved."</TE>
<TE>   Carolyn Stern, a computer programmer from Garden Grove, created
the site after noticing that similar ones such as Petfinder.com
relied entirely on shelter employees to take and post the photos.</TE>
<TE>   Having a volunteer-staffed site allows for more frequent updates
and for shelters to be represented even if they don't employ any
technologically savvy people, shelter officials said.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent trip to the East Valley Shelter in North Hollywood,
Heisen cooed to the cowering dogs and cats to lure them to her lens.</TE>
<TE>   Paws outstretched and moist noses pressed against the bars, the
dogs started wagging their tails as Heisen talked to them, taking
notes on each animal's behavior.</TE>
<TE>   A curly, dark-haired terrier who pressed herself against the cage
was quickly judged to be "affectionate," and a black-and-white kitten
earned a "spunky" label after repeatedly trying to swipe at Heisen's
pen.</TE>
<TE>   On the Web site, the animals are organized by shelter location,
then by type of animal.</TE>
<TE>   "We want people to see what's everywhere so they can get what they
want," Heisen said. "Whatever you have in mind, you can find it. You
just have to find it in time before they kill it."</TE>
<TE>   Often, the site draws people to the shelters who didn't realize
the variety of animals available, Heisen said.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people follow the myth that shelter animals are
throwaway animals, that they have health or behavior problems," she
said. "But they're full of purebreds, puppies, kittens -- animals
whose owner moved or died or married someone with an allergy."</TE>
<TE>   Although the shelters don't track which animal is adopted through
the site, officials have plenty of anecdotes about happy matches.</TE>
<TE>   Jean Miller, kennel supervisor for Ventura County's shelters,
remembers a couple who drove down from San Francisco to pick up a
Siamese cat, and a woman who came in from Fresno to get an Australian
shepherd after spotting them on the site.</TE>
<TE>   "The Web site gives them some direction, so they don't have to
blindly drive around from shelter to shelter," she said. "It
absolutely has helped animals that wouldn't have lived otherwise."</TE>
<TE>   Some animals are so adoptable that Heisen doesn't worry about them
-- the docile tan cocker spaniel with ice-blue eyes who's sure to
find a good home or the chipper brown Chihuahua who exudes affection
and gives kisses on command.</TE>
<TE>   But for others, like a mother and her three kittens who must be
adopted as a group, or a dark-eyed Australian shepherd so petrified
she refuses to pose, Heisen knows their options are limited.</TE>
<TE>   "The hardest thing is to resist taking them all home," said
Heisen, a government lawyer who has two dogs, four cats and a litter
of kittens.</TE>
<TE>   However, she said, she and the other volunteers try to be honest
in their descriptions, noting when an animal seems aggressive or
overly timid or if they have health complications.</TE>
<TE>   "Otherwise they'll have problems when they get home and bring them
right back," she said. "We want to make sure the animal's personality
is one they're ready for."</TE>
<TE>   As she crouches on the cement floor, conversing with the animals
as if they were professional models -- "Ooh, that was a cute one" and
"Oh gosh, you just put your nose in the way!" -- Heisen tries to find
out enough about each that she can write a proper description.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to note what appeals to us and include little stories,
like the cat who stretched up into my hand -- he was so friendly,"
she said. "Then the adopter feels like they've already met the
animal, and it forges a connection."</TE>
<TE>   For Dondo, the description of Niblet was what convinced her the
dog was ideal.</TE>
<TE>   "It said she was really sweet, that even though she was a little
timid she forced herself to approach the bars and say 'Hi,' " Dondo
said. "And then when I met her, a tiny, little trembly thing, I knew
she was meant for me. I didn't even have to look at the others."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The body of a teenage girl was found Saturday on a street in Hacienda
Heights, five miles from where sheriff's deputies believe she was
murdered.</LD>
<LD>   The deputies believe the girl, who had not been identified, was
killed at Turnbull Canyon Road and Skyline Drive and then dragged to
the intersection of Colima and Hacienda roads.</LD>
<LD>   California Highway Patrol officers arrived at the intersection
just before 5:30 a.m. after receiving a call about a dead body in the
road. They called sheriff's homicide detectives when they determined
that the girl was not the victim of a hit-and-run accident, said
Sheriff's Deputy Brian Lendman.</LD>
<TE>   No arrests had been made, and the cause of death was still under
investigation. Anyone with information is asked to call the sheriff's
department at (323) 890-5500.</TE>

<HD>Forest Closing Disappoints Hunters as Fire Threat
Interrupts Fall Ritual</HD>
<DH>Many favored spots are suddenly off limits as Forest
Service moves to limit risk of new blazes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Deborah Sullivan Brennan</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mark Shulz eagerly awaited the opening of deer season this fall--the
first year he and his two grown sons would hunt together.</LD>
<LD>   His sons had planned the trip for months, scouting their favorite
spots, securing deer and bear tags, and surprising their dad with a
new rifle recently on his 47th birthday.</LD>
<LD>   But on Oct. 3, just two days before the opening of deer season,
the U.S. Forest Service announced the closing of the San Bernardino
National Forest, including some of the most popular deer-hunting
zones in Southern California. Another deer-hunting region in the San
Bernardino Mountains that was set to open today will remain closed as
well.</LD>
<TE>   Severe drought and Santa Ana winds prompted forest supervisors to
shut the lands to the public. The fear is that catastrophic wildfires
could trap hunters or hikers in the back country, out of reach of
rescue crews. The forests will remain closed until enough rain falls
-- at least 2 inches -- to end the high fire threat, federal
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The closing was a sudden setback to the Shulzes and to more than
12,000 other hunters who purchased deer tags this year, only to find
most of the forest suddenly off limits.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we'll lose our money for the licenses. But, for me, the main
thing is I'll lose the time together with my sons," said Shulz, a
resident of Cherry Valley in northern Riverside County.</TE>
<TE>   "My youngest boy was really disappointed and devastated. He had
his heart set on seeing his dad get a deer with his new rifle," Shulz
said last week.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the California Department of Fish and Game, which
issues hunting permits, said they learned of the closing just days
before the public. Now they're scrambling to exchange deer tags sold
for the closed hunting zones for replacement tags in the few forest
areas still open in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   A resident needs one of the $19.95 tags, in addition to a $31
hunting license, to legally hunt for deer in the state.</TE>
<TE>   But authorities said they are fast running out of alternatives for
hunters. The Angeles National Forest in Los Angeles County was closed
to recreational users in September as the Williams fire scorched the
San Gabriel Mountains. On Wednesday, the Cleveland National Forest in
Orange County announced that it, too, would close off wilderness
areas to the public.</TE>
<TE>   Confusion Over Tags</TE>
<TE>   Farther north, the Los Padres National Forest remains open with
extra firefighting staff on hand, but it too could close in the event
of an active fire or sustained Santa Ana winds.</TE>
<TE>   As the forests shut down, some hunters exchanged their tags for
replacements in other areas, only to see those close down too, said
Craig Stowers, deer program coordinator for the Department of Fish
and Game.</TE>
<TE>   Nikki Kiriakous, 25, of Mentone in San Bernardino County said she
had planned to hunt in the San Bernardino Forest, but switched her
tag for an open deer-hunting area in the Cleveland Forest, only to
see that area close as well.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really all confusing," Kiriakous said.</TE>
<TE>   Deer-hunting areas are broken down into geographic zones by the
state. Though parts of those zones remain open, they tend to be on
Bureau of Land Management property outside the national forests that
hunters prefer.</TE>
<TE>   "All the hunters that are out of luck might as well have just
taken our money and thrown it in that forest fire," said Carl
Terrell, 63, of San Bernardino, an avid deer hunter. "We're talking
about hundreds of thousands of dollars."</TE>
<TE>   Hunters see signs of an anti-hunting bias in the closings,
pointing out that the forests remained open to hikers and campers
throughout the summer tourist season, despite devastating wildfires.</TE>
<TE>   Campgrounds and picnic grounds within a quarter of a mile of
developed roads remain open now.</TE>
<TE>   "They've managed to leave camping grounds, jeep trails and
campsites open in the forest. Why can't they leave some hunting
grounds open?" asked Merle Bindner, 47, of Mentone, treasurer of the
Southern California chapter of the California Deer Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Forest Service officials say they did not intend to shortchange
hunters, but held off on the closings until the last minute in hopes
of avoiding them.</TE>
<TE>   But the Williams fire, which sometimes burned against the wind as
it raged across more than 38,000 acres of the San Gabriel Mountains
late last month, offered an alarming preview of the kind of wildfires
that could erupt this fall, they said.</TE>
<TE>   And the continuing drought and Santa Ana winds raise the risk of a
new inferno.</TE>
<TE>   "Recently, in the Angeles, we have seen very extreme fire
behavior, to the point where we are concerned about our ability to
evacuate people from remote areas quickly enough," said Ruth
Wenstrom, public affairs officer for the San Bernardino National
Forest.</TE>
<TE>   But hunters argue that the Forest Service knew of the conditions
long before it announced the closing and should have warned the
public of its impending decision.</TE>
<TE>   Executives at Turner's Outdoorsman, a chain of sporting goods
stores specializing in hunting and fishing supplies, were so incensed
by the closing that they decided to stop selling Forest Adventure
Passes, the permits required for public access to the four Southern
California national forests.</TE>
<TE>   Andy McCormick, Turner's director of promotions and hunting
advisor, said the Forest Service had failed to inform the chain,
which sells $50,000 worth of the Adventure Passes each year, that it
might impose closures.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got bear tags that were sold out there, deer tags, upland
game stamps, hunting licenses and Adventure Passes themselves,"
McCormick said. "They fully were aware of what was going on for about
a month, and they continued letting us sell licenses."</TE>
<TE>   The Forest Service has said it would extend the valid period for
the Adventure Passes to make up for the closings.</TE>
<TE>   Refunds Considered</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Fish and Game may consider refunds for unusable
hunting tags, but it is not likely to extend the deer season, which
typically ends in early November.</TE>
<TE>   Hunting seasons are calibrated to match the species' reproductive
cycles, Fish and Game's Stowers said, and an extended season could
harm the deer population.</TE>
<TE>   Some hunters have resigned themselves to the missed opportunity,
noting that the same dry conditions that prompted the closings have
also devastated deer herds.</TE>
<TE>   "What I've witnessed, from going out scouting, is that all the
animals are affected by the drought, and we need to sit back and give
everything a rest," said Kerry O'Neal, 42, of Temecula.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people need to keep conservation in mind."</TE>

<HD>Workers Pull Retired Reactor From Its Dome at San Onofre</HD>
<DH>Unit 1 once provided enough power for 500,000 homes and

Carolina.</DH>

<LD>Using a massive crane, workers at the San Onofre Nuclear Generating
Station slowly -- and carefully -- removed a 600-ton nuclear reactor
from one of the power plant's three distinctive domes Saturday
morning.</LD>
<LD>   It took about 100 workers and engineers less than 90 minutes to
remove the reactor from Unit 1, the plant's oldest, which produced
power for Southern California Edison from 1968 to 1992, when it was
shut down.</LD>
<LD>   Removing the reactor was a key step in a nine-year, $500-million
decommission project that began in 1999. Drivers along Interstate 5
could see the 380-foot crane easing the delicate payload out of its
concrete dome.</LD>
<TE>   But unless they pulled over and stopped, they probably didn't see
it move. The reactor was lifted out at one foot per minute. Its fuel
was removed in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't dangerous from a radiation standpoint," said Edison
spokesman Ray Golden. "But it was a very heavy lift."</TE>
<TE>   The crane, owned by a Washington state company, is one of the
world's most powerful. It was brought to San Onofre by 75 tractor
trailers and took five weeks to assemble.</TE>
<TE>   To get to the reactor, workers removed the top of the 30-inch
thick, steel-reinforced concrete dome. Then they cut a 25-foot hole
from the top of a steel containment building that housed the reactor.</TE>
<TE>   Concrete was poured into the reactor to "keep everything in
place," Golden said. Once the reactor was removed, it was lowered
into a steel canister and more concrete was poured around it. Workers
will later weld a steel top to the canister to make it airtight.</TE>
<TE>   Sometime next year, the reactor will be loaded onto a vehicle that
has about 30 axles and 200 tires. It will be driven at 1 mph on
Highway 101, through San Onofre State Park and to a basin on Camp
Pendleton where it will be loaded onto a barge, which will float the
reactor to a radioactive disposal site in South Carolina -- the only
facility in the nation that will take it.</TE>
<TE>   Unit 1 once provided enough energy for 500,000 homes and
businesses. Edison decommissioned the reactor because it needed about
$100 million in upgrades. They also wanted some of the engineers who
helped build it a generation ago to help dismantle it before they
retired.</TE>
<TE>   "The job has come full circle for some of these individuals,"
Golden said.</TE>

<HD>Setback for Campaign Cash Limits</HD>

<LD>Orange County's campaign-finance ordinances, long considered among
the most restrictive in the nation, have been weakened by two court
rulings that have implications for local spending-control efforts
around California.</LD>
<LD>   The county and eight cities are the only governments in the state
that restrict campaign spending by outside groups that support or
oppose local candidates and measures. But a federal judge last week
blocked four of those governments -- Anaheim, Huntington Beach,
Orange and the county -- from enforcing the laws.</LD>
<LD>   And last month, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals criticized a
similar law on the books in Irvine, saying it restricted political
speech. Irvine agreed not to enforce its ordinance, and Laguna Beach
made the same decision after reviewing the court's opinion.</LD>
<TE>   The rulings are a setback for campaign-finance advocates, who --
over three decades -- have pushed through a series of limits on how
much Orange County individuals and groups can contribute to
campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   "It's created a farce of contribution limits," said Shirley
Grindle, an activist who has written a dozen campaign-finance laws in
Orange County and across the state.</TE>
<TE>   Among those laws were some that went beyond traditional
restrictions on campaign finance by limiting so-called independent
expenditures.</TE>
<TE>   Those expenditures are by outside groups that try to influence
elections without directly contributing to candidates, often by
paying for mailers and signs.</TE>
<TE>   The court actions appear to set boundaries on how far the local
rules can go. While courts have upheld limits on contributions
directly to candidates, they have struck down limits on spending.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the rulings effectively close the door on this type
of campaign restriction at the local level.</TE>
<TE>   "What the courts are saying is you can restrict the flow in [to
candidates], but not out," said Jim Knox, executive director of
California Common Cause, a government watchdog group based in
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   The ordinances in Orange County were adopted in the mid-1990s. The
laws applied to political groups whose members pay more than $1,000 a
year in dues. They restricted the groups to spending no more than 25%
of their campaign funds on any one race.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine's ordinance, passed in 1995, was even more restrictive. It
took its existing contribution limit for individuals, now $340, and
applied it to any group as well.</TE>
<TE>   The restriction was challenged in 1999 by the Lincoln Club, whose
members pay annual dues of $2,000 and donate to federal, state and
local Republican candidates. The club's members include some of the
county's top developers and CEOs.</TE>
<TE>   Before the ordinances went into effect, the Lincoln Club spent
freely in local races. In 1990, it spent a then-unheard-of $25,000 to
help defeat Irvine Mayor Larry Agran.</TE>
<TE>   Club President Michael Capaldi argued that campaign limits stifle
free speech and free association. That argument was the basis of the
group's lawsuit challenging the rules.</TE>
<TE>   The only other California city that limited campaign spending by
independent groups was San Francisco. But its restrictions were
overturned by a federal judge in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Grindle said the rulings "open the barn door" for outside groups
to spend freely and influence the outcome of elections.</TE>
<TE>   In light of the legal challenges, Orange County has revised its
campaign laws and is putting them before the voters next month.</TE>
<TE>   The changes include requiring independent campaign groups to
disclose political activity within 16 days of an election. Officials
reason that if they cannot restrict spending, at least they can make
sure it's publicly disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   But the proposed rules would also ease other campaign
restrictions. Currently, a married couple can donate up to $1,000 to
a candidate -- the maximum single contribution allowed. Fearing that
the rule would not survive a court challenge on the basis that it
might constitute a marriage penalty, the county amended it to allow
each spouse to donate up to $1,000.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of unfettered campaign spending say the only way to
clamp down is to create public financing at local and state levels.
Thirteen local jurisdictions across the nation have such systems,
including Long Beach, Los Angeles, Oakland and Petaluma. And San
Francisco went to such a system after the court threw out its
spending ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   But with the conservative elements in Orange County, experts said
public financing is highly unlikely.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bowing to community pressure, UC Davis officials are scaling back
plans for a new campus housing development.</LD>
<LD>   After critics said the original project was too large, university
officials released a new blueprint on Friday for a compact,
bike-friendly neighborhood for students, faculty and staff members.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said the new plan calls for construction of a 200-acre
project on campus agricultural research land that would house 3,700
people. An earlier draft of the proposal would have housed nearly
7,000 faculty and students.</LD>
<TE>   University officials have proposed the development as a way to
handle the surge of new students, faculty and staff expected in the
next decade. They hope to present a final development proposal to the
UC Board of Regents in November 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Housing is already a severe problem in Davis, where the rental
vacancy rate hovers around 1%.</TE>

<LD>A veteran narcotics officer has been fired for alleged misconduct
stemming from a 2001 case involving several hundred dollars worth of
cocaine.</LD>
<LD>   The Police Department dismissed John Gutierrez on Friday after a
probe concluded he falsified a report about finding cocaine during a
search and was untruthful about the matter in court testimony.</LD>
<LD>   Gutierrez's attorney said he plans to appeal the dismissal,
calling it "an excessive and unsupportable overreaction."</LD>
<TE>   While Gutierrez has been on administrative leave, the department
has dismissed several cases he investigated. Last October, just
before his troubles began, the department had named Gutierrez officer
of the year.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A colorful Monterey County political figure was killed Friday when he
was thrown from his car after it veered off California 1 near Big
Sur.</LD>
<LD>   Campaign consultant Angel Garcia, 51, a former correctional
officer, was a Latino Republican activist who managed numerous
political campaigns through his Salinas consulting firm.</LD>
<LD>   He was the chief fund-raiser for the group fighting a Nov. 5
ballot measure intended to scrap the Salinas utility tax.</LD>
<TE>   Garcia also ran unsuccessfully for the Assembly in 1988, and was
the first Monterey County Latino to serve as a delegate to a national
GOP convention -- in Houston in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   California Highway Patrol officials said it is not clear what
caused Garcia's Volkswagen Beetle to swerve off the highway.</TE>
<TE>   A witness reported seeing a motorcycle and two cars driving
recklessly in the opposite direction moments before the accident,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said Garcia was alone in the car and was not wearing
a seat belt. The crash remains under investigation.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Sonoma County judge has blocked the release of serial rapist George
Benjamin Putney, ruling that the state must reevaluate the case under
its sexually violent predator law.</LD>
<LD>   Putney, 54, was convicted of four rapes and one attempted rape
between 1966 and 1982. He has been committed to a state mental
hospital since completing his prison term in 1996.</LD>
<LD>   The state Mental Health Department recommended his release earlier
this year. But a Superior Court judge said the state must review
whether Putney still qualifies under the sexually violent predator
law. It allows the state to keep those inmates deemed likely to
attack again confined to mental facilities after they finish their
prison terms.</LD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A prominent medical marijuana advocate, who once smoked pot on the
steps of City Hall to draw attention to his cause, is facing at least
five years in prison if found guilty of growing marijuana.</LD>
<LD>   Steven McWilliams, 48, pleaded innocent to federal charges Friday
after being arrested by U.S drug enforcement agents. He was later
released and pledged to pay a $50,000 bond if he fails to show up for
court appearances.</LD>
<LD>   More than two weeks ago, federal agents uprooted 25 marijuana
plants from the frontyard of McWilliams' home.</LD>
<TE>   A Drug Enforcement Administration officer had previously delivered
to McWilliams a letter signed by interim U.S. Atty. Carol Lam warning
him that he might be arrested if he did not stop growing marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   McWilliams and his partner operate a resource center and help sick
and dying people legally obtain the drug under California's
Proposition 215.</TE>
<TE>   The state law conflicts with federal drug statutes, which prohibit
the use, possession or cultivation of marijuana.</TE>

<TE>   From the place where they sat.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Was it a thief?</TE>
<TE>   Was it a prank?</TE>
<TE>   Police have to say,</TE>
<TE>   They are drawing a blank.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pomona, California</TE>
<TE>   Is the scene of the crime--</TE>
<TE>   On Second and Garvey,</TE>
<TE>   Early Friday the time.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More than $50,000</TE>
<TE>   The value of props</TE>
<TE>   Custom-made for the film,</TE>

<TE>   So there's no joy in Seussville,</TE>

<TE>   The oversized pieces</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A golf ball, an anvil,</TE>
<TE>   Some glasses, a key.</TE>
<TE>   Each of them as big</TE>
<TE>   As a decent-sized tree.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   However it happened,</TE>
<TE>   The goods, they did fly.</TE>
<TE>   From a fenced-off area,</TE>
<TE>   Security nearby.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The props sure were heavy,</TE>

<TE>   The cops have no leads,</TE>
<TE>   No way to give chase.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   They hope that the props</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The golf ball might show up</TE>

<TE>   But there's no guarantee.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>2002 Spike in Air Pollution Reverses Downward Trend</HD>
<DH>Officials downplay the one-year rise, partly blaming fires
and heat. Others question current policy. Problem migrates to inland
areas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Polakovic</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California has endured its worst air pollution season in several
years, as inland valleys have been smothered in a pall of haze and
ozone has spread to far-flung regions unaccustomed to smog.</LD>
<LD>   The increase in pollution is a sharp reversal after years of
improvements in air quality statewide and has renewed debate over
whether California is on the right track in the fight for clean air.</LD>
<LD>   Smog levels were up from Santa Clarita to Sacramento, driven by
hot, dry, stagnant weather that prevailed statewide much of the
summer and by forest fires that polluted the air over formerly
smog-free places such as Death Valley National Park and the eastern
Sierra Nevada.</LD>
<TE>   In sharp contrast, coast-hugging urban communities from San
Francisco to San Diego largely escaped the siege. Ozone pollution is
rapidly becoming a thing of the past along the coastal plains as an
east-west divide splits the state into zones of clean and polluted
air.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the city of Los Angeles and the southern part of Los
Angeles County have been in that smog-free zone for several years.
Smog-monitoring stations in downtown Los Angeles, Lynwood and West
Los Angeles all recorded zero days so far this year in which ozone
readings exceeded federal standards. Burbank has had one bad-air day.
Reseda has had nine, according to data collected by the South Coast
Air Quality Management District.</TE>
<TE>   But the AQMD's jurisdiction -- all of Orange County and parts of
Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties -- overall
experienced 49 days when ozone in at least one part of the basin
exceeded federal health-based standards, 36% more than last year. Air
quality officials treat the entire area as a single entity because
emissions generated in one place help cause smog downwind.</TE>
<TE>   Readings that exceed the federal standards mean there was enough
ozone in the air to cause headaches, nausea or shortness of breath
for at least some people an average of one day in three during smog
season so far.</TE>
<TE>   Air is considered unhealthful if it contains more than 120 parts
per billion of ozone in one hour. The smog season officially ends
Oct. 31, but air quality officials do not expect the figures to
change greatly in the final weeks of the month.</TE>
<TE>   The worst air pollution in Southern California has been in the
Santa Clarita Valley, which has suffered 32 days of unhealthful
ozone. Other Southland smog hotspots this year have included
Crestline and Redlands (23 each); Banning (14); Rubidoux and Glendora
(12 each).</TE>
<TE>   Joe Cassmassi, senior meteorologist for the AQMD, said southerly
ocean breezes carried emissions north to Santa Clarita. Also,
wildfires in early summer kicked up massive amounts of nitrate -- not
from smoke, but from air pollution fallout that had accumulated on
chaparral for years -- adding to local smog. The AQMD also moved an
air pollution tracking station in Santa Clarita, which may account
for some of the extra violations, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Smog has been very noticeable this year. It makes our life more
difficult," said Rick Winsman, president of the Santa Clarita Valley
Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   Air quality officials caution against making too much of one
year's smog levels. They emphasize how much smog depends on fickle
weather conditions, and they instead rely on long-term trends to
gauge progress. Measured by that yardstick, the progress toward clean
air is indisputable.</TE>
<TE>   A decade ago, weather conditions similar to those that occurred
this summer would have produced nearly 150 unhealthful days, as well
as a few dozen days of "very unhealthful" skies, when "air was so
poor a healthy person would feel the effects just walking out the
door," said an AQMD spokesman, Sam Atwood.</TE>
<TE>   Days of bad ozone are down about 65% since 1992, the peak
concentrations are much less severe, ozone is not massed over the
urban core as it once was, and dreaded "first stage alerts," when air
quality was very unhealthful for everybody, disappeared four years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Eighty percent of [California's] population lives within 10 miles
of the coast. You have a great deal of the population in the South
Coast area experiencing much cleaner air," said Jack Broadbent,
administrator of air programs for the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency's West Coast office.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to stringent regulations and innovative solutions by
industry, Californians now drive the cleanest cars powered by the
cleanest fuels in use anywhere in the world. They use some of the
cleanest consumer products and work in jobs using some of the
cleanest technology in the nation. More reductions are on the way
too, as new regulations require super-clean cars and smoke-free buses
and trucks.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we're losing our way. We are on target, but you're
going to see year-to-year fluctuations," said AQMD's chief, Barry
Wallerstein.</TE>
<TE>   Others say that, after years of impressive gains, California may
be slipping.</TE>
<TE>   "I think California is backsliding on air quality," said V. John
White, a Sierra Club lobbyist and air quality consultant in
Sacramento. "We're always at risk of growth eating up our gains.
Today, we're living off the extraordinary gains in the '80s and '90s,
and we don't have much intensity and focus. There's a complacency --
too many victory laps. But the self-congratulatory phase is over, and
we need to get back to work."</TE>
<TE>   "We are concerned about it," said Rich Varenchik, spokesman for
the state Air Resources Board. In the Los Angeles region, "progress
... has been pretty flat the past few years."</TE>
<TE>   "Weather is obviously the main factor that has contributed to this
little bump up," Varenchik said. But, he added, the Los Angeles area
"still has this classic problem of more people, more growth, more
miles driven. Maybe this year was just a hiccup, but it will take a
couple more years to really see."</TE>
<TE>   One peculiar trend scientists note is how smog is occurring
farther and farther inland in California each year. The worst smog in
the Sacramento area occurred far downwind in Placer County, while in
the Los Angeles region, the ozone hotspot has steadily shifted
eastward from Pasadena to Glendora and on to Crestline over the last
20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Janet Arey, an atmospheric chemist at UC Riverside's Air Pollution
Research Center, said rapid growth in inland regions means more
home-grown emissions from businesses, consumer products and traffic.
Also, reformulated paints, gasoline and solvents have less reactive
chemicals, which slows ozone formation and causes it to reach peak
levels farther downwind, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in the state, the pattern of bad air in inland regions
has persisted. In the San Joaquin Valley, 33 days of unhealthful
ozone were reported -- up 38% from the previous year. Parlier, a
small town southeast of Fresno, had the most smoggy days and one of
the highest readings in the state, almost 40% over the federal limit.</TE>
<TE>   In the Sacramento area, air violated the federal ozone standard on
10 days -- more than three times as many violations as last year,
officials report.</TE>
<TE>   "High heat, calm winds, temperatures over 100 degrees for days on
end: That is the perfect recipe for smog stew, and that's what we had
this year," said Kerry Shearer, spokesman for the Sacramento
Metropolitan Air Quality Management District.</TE>
<TE>   Across the nation, more air pollution was measured in major cities
over the last two years, as a result, largely, of record heat.
Preliminary data show that there were 23% more days of high ozone in
2002 than in 2001, according to a report the U.S. Public Interest
Research Group released in August.</TE>
<TE>   The only winner in the California smog siege is Houston, which at
one point supplanted the Los Angeles region for the nation's smog
crown, but this year is on pace for a record-setting clean-air year,
with 23 unhealthful days.</TE>
<TE>   "The weather patterns that bring wind and rain to Houston bring
stagnant weather to L.A. They flip-flop with each other a lot of the
time," said Brian Lambeth, senior meteorologist for the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality.</TE>

<HD>Victim's Mother Starts Anti-Hazing Group</HD>

<LD>A mother who believes her daughter, a Cal State Los Angeles student,
was participating in a sorority ritual when she drowned last month,
announced on Saturday the founding of Mothers Against Hazing, a
nonprofit organization she created to end dangerous pledging
practices.</LD>
<LD>   Patricia Strong-Fargas told a crowd of nearly 40 people who
gathered at an Inglewood restaurant that she blames Alpha Kappa
Alpha, a prominent black sorority, for the death of her daughter,
Kristin High, 22. High, who had a 2-year-old son, drowned in the
waters of Dockweiler State Beach in Playa del Rey on Sept. 9.</LD>
<LD>   High's family recently filed a $100-million wrongful death lawsuit
against the sorority. It claims Alpha Kappa Alpha members led a
blindfolded High into strong waves late that night as part of a
pledging ritual that is popular among black fraternities and
sororities on the West Coast.</LD>
<TE>   Another Cal State L.A. student, Kenitha Saafir, 24, of Compton,
also drowned that night. Like High, Saafir was pledging the sorority.</TE>
<TE>   Police have said that the drownings were accidental. There was no
evidence of wrongdoing, and no blindfolds or ropes were found at the
scene. But hazing has not been ruled out and the investigation is
ongoing, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers, family and community members claim Alpha Kappa Alpha
members have refused to provide information to help the
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   At least five other women were at the beach that night. Three of
those women were members of the sorority and the other two were
pledges.</TE>
<TE>   "This movement is not about bringing down black fraternities or
sororities. We have a lot of support for what they do," said Angela
Reddock, an attorney for the family. "But it is about uncovering this
world which we all know exists."</TE>
<TE>   Mothers Against Hazing will pressure lawmakers to adopt stricter
anti-hazing laws and demand that fraternities and sororities prohibit
hazardous pledging customs, Strong-Fargas said.</TE>
<TE>   Hazing is a misdemeanor defined under state law as any act that
may cause degradation and mental or physical harm. Strong-Fargas
wants the state to adopt a "Kristin Law," named after her daughter,
to make hazing a felony.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be your child next, and I don't want that to happen,"
she told the gathering at Farmer's Restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Holman Arthurs, 25, held a photograph of High, his fiancee, with
the couple's son, Skyler. A woman in the audience wiped away tears
when Arthurs said, "She was the love of my life."</TE>
<TE>   "Every day I am faced with answering the question, 'Daddy, where's
Mommy?' " Arthurs said. "There are people out there that know what
happened. [They] are part of the organization and they need to speak
out."</TE>
<TE>   Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of the National Alliance for
Positive Action, a public advocacy group that promotes social change,
said he is motivated to work with Strong-Fargas because she is
unwavering in her fight for justice. The alliance coordinated
Saturday's discussion.</TE>
<TE>   "Here is a mother who is not just sitting back and weeping," he
said. "She's determined to do something about it."</TE>
<TE>   He said he hopes Mothers Against Hazing will raise awareness among
parents and students, as well as push for stricter punishment for
those caught engaging in such practices.</TE>
<TE>   Strong-Fargas said the organization also plans to create mentoring
and scholarship programs for women.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to call on mothers of any children involved in
fraternities or sororities to come out and band with the community to
stop this," she said.</TE>

<HD>Beauty of Star's Bucolic Retreat Belies Its Bloodstained
History</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In the heart of a tiny canyon community that bears its name, along a
narrow canyon road that snakes through olive groves and California
live oaks, stands the 114-year-old, five-gabled, white-frame Helena
Modjeska Historical House and Garden, an Orange County-owned national
landmark.</LD>
<LD>   Modjeska, a Shakespearean actress born in Poland, dubbed her ranch
Arden because it reminded her of the love-enchanted forest in
Shakespeare's "As You Like It." She intended it as a retreat, but it
ended up with bloody fingerprints all over it.</LD>
<LD>   First, her foreman died at the hands of an ex-employee, who in
turn became the victim of the first -- and last -- lynching in Orange
County. Then her architect was murdered by a jealous husband.</LD>
<TE>   Modjeska was born in Krakow in 1840 to a family with 10 children.
Her father, a high school teacher, had a passion for music and taught
several of his children to play instruments.</TE>
<TE>   When she was 7, her father died. As a tribute, she and several of
her older siblings formed a neighborhood theatrical group and
performed at parties. She soon learned that she loved the stage.</TE>
<TE>   As a teenager, she found a mentor -- and lover -- in Gustave
Sinnmayer Modrzejewski, a family friend who was married and twice her
age, but who had theatrical connections. For propriety's sake, she
took his name, which she eventually shortened to Modjeska. They had
two children, one of whom died in childhood.</TE>
<TE>   By the early 1860s she had left him and begun managing her own
career. During one performance, she was drawn to a wiry, mustachioed
journalist in the audience. Karol (Charles) Bozenta Chlapowski, the
son of a nobleman, would become her husband and manager for the next
43 years. She called him Charlie. Americans called him Count Bozenta;
Chlapowski was too hard to pronounce.</TE>
<TE>   By 1876, she had become Poland's leading actress, which set
jealous tongues to wagging. Even though she was by then a respectable
married lady, stage rivals began to spread juicy gossip about her and
her 15-year-old son, whose father was her former lover. The scandal
pushed Modjeska, a devout Catholic, to the brink of a nervous
breakdown and into retirement at age 36.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking a gentle clime and a gentle vocation, she and her family
joined a small group of artists and intellectuals who moved to
Anaheim, hoping to become successful farmers. (Among them was Henry
Sienkiewicz, a journalist who would later write the epic novel "Quo
Vadis" and win the 1905 Nobel Prize for literature.)</TE>
<TE>   Their new venture seemed founded on fiction, however. None of them
could milk a cow or catch a turkey, and they knew more about books,
paintings and fine clothing than farming tools.</TE>
<TE>   Modjeska threw herself into her new role as housekeeper and cook,
but the venture lasted only six months and wound up $15,000 in the
red.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the emigres returned to Poland, but Modjeska returned to
the stage. She spent six months learning English in San Francisco.
Then, in 1877, she made her debut in the title role of "Adrienne
Lecouvreur."</TE>
<TE>   Over the next decade, she and her husband traveled the world as
she shared the stage with such greats as Maurice Barrymore, Otis
Skinner and Edwin Booth, the brother of assassin John Wilkes Booth.</TE>
<TE>   She and Bozenta returned to Southern California for vacations,
however, and in 1887 they purchased a Santiago Canyon property they
had admired during their farming days. It would soon grow from a
peaceful 400-acre retreat to a 1,300-acre working ranch with olive
groves, barley and cattle.</TE>
<TE>   This time, they didn't try to run it themselves. They left it in
professional hands and continued to travel, using the ranch as a
haven from the road.</TE>
<TE>   The scenery looming over their tiny cabin included Flores Peak, a
perpetual reminder of drama from an earlier era. In January 1857, a
mob cornered an outlaw, Juan Flores, there, at the top of its
200-foot precipice. To escape, he blindfolded his horse and they both
jumped off the cliff. He survived; the horse wasn't so lucky. About a
month later, Flores was caught and hanged in Los Angeles on
Valentine's Day for his part in the murder of a San Juan Capistrano
storekeeper and L.A. County Sheriff James Barton.</TE>
<TE>   In 1888, Modjeska and Bozenta hired renowned Eastern architect
Stanford White to transform their simple cabin into a grand country
manor. Today, it is the only remaining White-designed residence in
the West. Among his other creations were a host of mansions and clubs
for the likes of the Vanderbilts, Pulitzers and J.P. Morgan; the
Boston Public Library and the Washington Square Arch in Greenwich
Village.</TE>
<TE>   But White, quite the ladies' man, was known less for his Gilded
Age architecture than for his 1906 murder. Among his conquests was
chorus girl Evelyn Nesbit, who was married to a millionaire playboy,
Harry Thaw. The incensed husband killed the architect at Madison
Square Garden -- which White also had designed.</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't the first bloodshed linked to the ranch. On the
morning of July 30, 1892, while Modjeska was visiting friends at the
beach, her husband learned that the county road overseer had been
unable to collect the annual $2.50 road-improvement tax from a
Mexican laborer, Francisco Torres, who had worked at the ranch less
than a month. Bozenta told the foreman, William McKelvey, to deduct
the tax from Torres' $9 weekly salary.</TE>
<TE>   Torres didn't understand why his pay had been docked, and McKelvey
couldn't explain in Spanish. Torres became angry, demanded his money,
threatened McKelvey and stormed out empty-handed.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, he returned and argued with McKelvey again. As
McKelvey was feeding the chickens, Torres struck him twice on the
head and stabbed him through the heart. A bloody pickax handle was
found nearby.</TE>
<TE>   No one witnessed the murder, but a ranch hand had heard their
argument and the blows that followed.</TE>
<TE>   McKelvey's murder galvanized the community. The Board of
Supervisors offered a $200 reward for Torres' capture and Gov. Henry
H. Markham offered another $300. Ten days later, Torres was found in
San Diego County with McKelvey's wallet, which contained $5.40.</TE>
<TE>   Torres said he had acted in self-defense. He said McKelvey had
attacked him first and had drawn a pistol.</TE>
<TE>   The posse returned him to Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 18, after a preliminary hearing, Torres' lawyer promised
to seek a change of venue to ensure a fair trial.</TE>
<TE>   But onlookers had other ideas. Two days later, a mob of 14 to 30
masked men broke into Torres' jail cell, dragged him outside and
hanged him from a lamppost. Pinned to his chest was a note: "A change
of venue."</TE>
<TE>   Newspapers across the state condemned the lynching, but it was
generally accepted that Torres was guilty. A grand jury looked into
the crime but failed to identify any member of the mob. Public
sentiment was reflected when the local funeral home proudly displayed
the noose used to hang Torres.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the murders, Arden was one of the few places Modjeska
could find peace. She and her husband vacationed there for several
months every year. She would ride horses, walk in the rose garden,
smoke cigarettes and sit under the oaks chatting with friends. Her
summers were reserved for Poland, where she continued her career and
her lifetime friendships.</TE>
<TE>   But her visits came to an abrupt halt in 1895 after she made a
speech in Chicago criticizing the Russians for oppressing the Polish
people. Her native land banned her. First she was angry, then
devastated.</TE>
<TE>   By 1906, she and her husband could no longer afford the ranch.
They'd given generously to worthy causes over the years, leaving
themselves little for retirement. They sold Arden and moved to a tiny
cottage in Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, although Modjeska's health was precarious, she
could not resist one last call to the stage. She performed Lady
Macbeth's sleepwalking scene from "Macbeth" at a Los Angeles benefit
for victims of an earthquake in Sicily.</TE>
<TE>   "The voice of Lady Macbeth was also the voice of a dying
Modjeska," an unkind critic wrote.</TE>
<TE>   She died a few months later, in 1909, from a kidney ailment known
as Bright's disease. She was 68.</TE>
<TE>   Her funeral was fit for a queen. Thousands turned out to mourn her
in Anaheim and the Pacific Electric railway sent a private car to
carry her casket to St. Vibiana's Cathedral in Los Angeles. Shops
closed and schools let out early as thousands thronged downtown
streets.</TE>
<TE>   In death, Poland welcomed her. Her husband and son returned her
body to Krakow, where Sienkiewicz gave her a glorious tribute.</TE>
<TE>   Bozenta never returned to America. He died in 1914 and was buried
alongside his wife.</TE>
<TE>   Modjeska's former home went through several owners and the land
was sold off bit by bit. Finally, in 1986, Orange County bought the
remaining 14.4-acre estate for $1 million.</TE>

<HD>Bus Riders Feel Stranded by Lack of Valley-to-Valley Runs</HD>
<DH>Santa Clarita Transit officials admit the need but say
expanded service is at least two years away.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Caitlin Liu</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To hear Santa Clarita resident Jim Hogan describe his public transit
travails to and from the San Fernando Valley, you'd think he lives on
an island where ferries to the mainland are few and far between.</LD>
<LD>   "We're landlocked," said Hogan, a 55-year-old office worker. "It's
terrible."</LD>
<LD>   The lack of all-day, seven-day-a-week local bus service between
the two valleys -- separated by less than a dozen miles of mountains
-- has long been a complaint of transit riders. But there has been
little official action to date, other than issuing reports that
repeatedly document the problem.</LD>
<TE>   Officials acknowledge the lack of transit service is a top "unmet
need," but say there will be no improvement for at least two more
years, when a new Santa Clarita Transit bus yard opens.</TE>
<TE>   The yard will allow the agency to operate more coaches.</TE>
<TE>   "We know this is important to the public. It's the No. 1
priority," said Bob Murphy, transportation manager for Santa Clarita
Transit. "Our main barrier right now is lack of resources in terms of
facilities. We're just out of room."</TE>
<TE>   Over the last decade, the agency's fleet of buses and paratransit
vans expanded from 29 to 80 vehicles, and the agency cannot handle
any more until the completion of a 12-acre maintenance yard in
mid-2004, Murphy said.</TE>
<TE>   Expanding service also will require more funding, he said. The
cost of adding one line with all-day stops would be $1.26 million.
The transit agency's budget is $11 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs
buses into the jurisdictions of other transit agencies, such as
Ventura County, say they provided $4.75 million to Santa Clarita
Transit this year and it's up to Santa Clarita to decide how to spend
it.</TE>
<TE>   One thing is certain. Bus riders on both sides of the hills are
fuming.</TE>
<TE>   "When I talked to MTA about it, they said to talk to Santa
Clarita. Santa Clarita said just to talk to MTA about it," said Wayne
Wright, 41, a Windsor Hills resident who believes the two agencies
should talk more to each other.</TE>
<TE>   Transit advocates blame the inaction on a lack of political will.</TE>
<TE>   While a 1994 MTA study, a 1997 Santa Clarita Transit report and
more recent public hearings have proposed creating a local bus line
running between the two valleys, no route has been added.</TE>
<TE>   "If [the agencies] wanted to get service sooner, there's a way to
do it," said Bart Reed, executive director of the Transit Coalition,
a nonprofit group in Sylmar. "The working poor, they just don't have
the constituency to push for this."</TE>
<TE>   Commuter buses and trains do run between the valleys, but riders
say the routes and schedules don't serve non-commuters who depend on
transit.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Clarita Transit runs express buses mostly during morning and
afternoon rush hours to such areas as Warner Center, Van Nuys,
Century City and downtown Los Angeles. The commuter buses don't run
at night or on weekends.</TE>
<TE>   Metrolink trains connect Santa Clarita to downtown Los Angeles,
with stops at Sylmar, Sun Valley, Burbank and Glendale from Monday to
Saturday. But the stops can be infrequent, sometimes hours apart. And
there's no service on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Kymberleigh Richards, a spokeswoman for Southern California
Transit Advocates, said the higher cost for commuter service is a
hardship on low-income riders.</TE>
<TE>   A commuter express bus ride from valley to valley costs $3.50 one
way, and up to $5.25 for rail. Riders pay $1.35 or less for a local
bus ride.</TE>
<TE>   Disabled riders have an especially tough time traveling from
valley to valley, said Hogan, chairman of a committee advising the
city of Santa Clarita on transportation for the disabled.</TE>
<TE>   The disabled have all-day paratransit service within Santa Clarita
and within the rest of Los Angeles. But between the valleys, only
three paratransit vans run a day--one in early morning, one about
noon and one in the late afternoon. Such limited scheduling makes it
difficult to keep doctor appointments, disabled riders say.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans with Disabilities Act requires transit agencies to
provide paratransit at a level comparable to their "fixed-route"
service, such as local bus lines. Commuter buses and trains are not
considered "fixed route."</TE>
<TE>   Because there is no "fixed-route" service between the two valleys,
there is no corresponding obligation to provide all-day service to
disabled riders through this area, said David Foster, spokesman for
Access Services Inc., which oversees paratransit in Los Angeles
County.</TE>
<TE>   But if either the MTA or Santa Clarita Transit ran all-day bus
service though the mountains, then Access would run similar
paratransit service.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of an inter-valley local bus line also has frustrated
employers as well as job-seekers.</TE>
<TE>   "Welfare-to-work programs are great, but people still have to get
to work," said Rachel Feldstein, director of Chrysalis, a Pacoima
nonprofit group that helps people find employment.</TE>
<TE>   "Clients don't even bother applying for jobs in Santa Clarita.
They check the bus map, and they find they can't get there,"
Feldstein said.</TE>

<HD>For Newborn Twins, Timing Was Just Right</HD>
<DH>The girls were at risk of being suffocated by their
umbilical cords when doctors saw problem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephanie Chavez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Ada Menjivar had been late for her doctor appointment, if the
doctor had been running way behind schedule, if the ultrasound
machine had been tied up -- as it often is -- then her newborn twin
girls would probably not be alive today, White Memorial Medical
Center officials said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   But the timing was just right for the 30-year-old woman carrying
28-week-old twins, her first pregnancy.</LD>
<LD>   In less than two hours Friday afternoon, Dr. Kathryn Shaw
discovered that Menjivar's pregnancy was a statistical rarity, that
the babies were in grave danger and that only an emergency caesarean
section could save them.</LD>
<TE>   "It's only through a miracle of God that my babies are alive,"
Menjivar said Saturday from her hospital bed. "The doctor told me a
few more minutes and they would have died."</TE>
<TE>   When the babies were delivered, doctors found that their umbilical
cords were tangled in what Shaw said resembled a "ball of yarn in a
gigantic knot."</TE>
<TE>   It was that knot that began to restrict life-sustaining nutrients
and oxygen to one of the babies shortly after Shaw hooked Menjivar up
to an ultrasound and fetal monitoring machine late Friday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Within minutes or hours, the fetuses probably would have died,
Shaw said.</TE>
<TE>   The girls, Milka Fabianna and Nancy Faviola Guillen, were in
critical condition Saturday in the neonatal intensive care unit, and
are expected to be hospitalized for several weeks, officials said.
Each weighed slightly less than 2 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   The babies were monoamniotic, meaning that they shared one
placenta and one amniotic sac, a condition found in fewer than 1% of
twin pregnancies, Shaw said.</TE>

birth.</TE>
<TE>   "Little angels must have carried them into my office," Shaw said.
"It was definitely fortuitous timing."</TE>
<TE>   Menjivar didn't even have an appointment Friday with Shaw, who is
a high-risk obstetrics specialist and director of maternal fetal
medicine at White Memorial in Boyle Heights.</TE>
<TE>   Menjivar showed up at Shaw's office after her regular doctor told
her to see a specialist because of her condition.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw agreed to squeeze in her new patient, and said "it was all a
little shocking, that in a couple of minutes we would need to do an
emergency C-section."</TE>
<TE>   "I just thank God that I had the help of these doctors," Menjivar
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I just want my babies to be fine and well."</TE>

<HD>Downtrodden Downtown Builds a New, Upscale Identity in
Ventura</HD>
<DH>Resurgence gains momentum with a pair of condominium
developments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daryl Kelley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura has been a poor man's seaside resort, the white-sand home of
Midwestern migrants and faded thrift stores, dismissed as
"Bakersfield by the Sea."</LD>
<LD>   But with the opening of new restaurants and a movie complex, the
arrival of live theater and trendy boutiques, Ventura's downtown has
become more quaint than tattered, more cool retreat than homeless
haven.</LD>
<LD>   Out-of-town visitors and Main Street merchants join city officials
in saying Ventura's old downtown, radiating out from an 18th century
Spanish mission and a century-old City Hall, has begun to live up to
its promise.</LD>
<TE>   "We're not Santa Barbara, we're not Pasadena and we're not Santa
Monica," said author and planning expert Bill Fulton, whose office
occupies a Victorian house on Main Street. "But we're not Bakersfield
either. We're a prosperous beach town. We have a great downtown. It's
bustling."</TE>
<TE>   So far, the bustle is only a few blocks long and a couple of
blocks wide. But in the latest sign that an economic revival may
finally fill the weeded, vacant lots along Santa Clara Street and
replace the red-light motels of Thompson Boulevard, homebuilders are
eyeing downtown Ventura as never before.</TE>
<TE>   The Olson Co., the state's largest developer of urban "in-fill" --
housing in aging city centers -- has already sold nearly all of the
26 Spanish-style condominiums it is constructing on one long-vacant
acre at downtown's edge next to the Ventura Freeway. Prices range
from $327,500 to $379,500, nearly double what they could have
commanded three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everybody's interested in building in the downtown," said
Todd Olson, managing director of acquisitions for the Seal
Beach-based company. He said Olson wants to build another larger
project nearby.</TE>
<TE>   And on a hillside across from Ventura's neoclassical City Hall,
architect and developer Ray Mulokas is finishing 33 upscale condos,
including four penthouses with dramatic ocean views priced up to $1
million each. Three of the units are artist's lofts. Offices will
line the street level of the four-story building.</TE>
<TE>   "Ventura is just beginning to realize its potential," said
Mulokas, who plans to live in one of the penthouses. "It's a
fantastic little town. And everybody is beginning to discover it."</TE>
<TE>   Mulokas, who has built about 1,000 dwellings in Southern
California in the past 30 years, said he has 200 people on a waiting
list for his condos. He hopes to build another complex not far away
on what is now city land. He also has ambitious plans, including
elaborate drawings, for other parcels he will not yet discuss.</TE>
<TE>   "Developers are crawling all over every piece of property down
here, looking for opportunities," said architect Nicholas Deitch, who
is working with four of them.</TE>
<TE>   Deitch has worked on the same block of Main Street for 20 years,
waiting for the downtown area to awake from its slumber.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first started, you could park anywhere you wanted, anytime
you wanted," he said. With a Main Street parking space almost as rare
as snow on the beach, a new parking garage was built four years ago
for the overflow.</TE>
<TE>   The city spent $18 million over five years in the 1990s to
refurbish the downtown core, sprucing up Main and California streets
with decorative sidewalks and palm trees and underwriting the
four-story parking garage and a new 10-screen movie theater. That has
increased the city's share of downtown property taxes by at least $1
million a year.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there is a comfort level in the downtown that wasn't here
before," said Denise Sindelar, co-owner of Natalie's Fine Threads, a
Main Street shop where sales have grown steadily since opening in
1996. "We've been here six years, and it's changed so much for the
better -- it's safer. There had been this stigma that only the
homeless lived here."</TE>
<TE>   Sindelar, an arts supporter, may now choose on weekend nights
between comedy improv at the Livery community theater and plays at
the cozy 200-seat Rubicon Theater, which hosts a stage company that
features actors such as Larry Hagman, Stephanie Zimbalist and Linda
Gray.</TE>
<TE>   "The Rubicon Theater has brought people up from Los Angeles [who]
never came before," Sindelar said.</TE>
<TE>   Nona Bogatch founded her Victoria Rose bed and breakfast in a 19th
century church near the downtown three years ago. Since then, she has
seen the opening of half a dozen fine restaurants to which she refers
her guests.</TE>
<TE>   "With the revitalization of the downtown, we have more people,
from more places," she said. "These are wonderful restaurants, and
the movie theater is great. Keeping out the fast-food restaurants had
really helped us."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura, with its population of 100,900, is already considered a
model of how older cities can begin to reinvent themselves. Now
officials hope it can show how a land-poor city in a county where
outward expansion is strictly controlled can look inward to
accommodate population growth. The key is new housing.</TE>
<TE>   Based on city plans, Deitch figures 2,000 to 6,000 new dwellings
will eventually be built downtown, which occupies an area 10 blocks
long and four blocks wide, bounded by foothills and the ocean, and by
the Ventura River and Ash Street. About 800 residences currently
exist; nearly all were built at least 20 years ago, Deitch said.</TE>
<TE>   During the last decade, just one housing project was built
downtown, a 13-unit senior citizen complex. But a hint of the current
housing turnaround began four years ago, with the rehabilitation of
the Henshaw Hotel, a former transient hotel where a studio apartment
now rents for about $1,000 a month.</TE>
<TE>   "We look at housing as a major issue," said Sidney White, the
city's manager of economic development. "I think we are moving at all
due speed. It's sort of this methodical movement toward success,
rather than a rush to failure.... But we are looking to speed up the
process."</TE>
<TE>   Developers have complained for years about the city's cumbersome
process for approving downtown projects. It took Olson four years to
break ground on its project. And Mulokas said he started trying to
build on his site in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "It took a lot of staying power to get this up," Mulokas said
recently, peering through graceful arches near the courtyard of his
Italian villa-styled condos. "The plans alone took more than a year
to get through plan check.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good that people are careful and watching closely, but it
should not be this difficult to get a project done," he said.</TE>
<TE>   White said the city's goal is to make the process simpler and
quicker.</TE>
<TE>   By next October, he said, the city expects to pick builders for
several projects that would produce dozens, perhaps hundreds, of
dwellings around the downtown area. And unlike the Olson and Mulokas
projects, they would emphasize affordability.</TE>
<TE>   "I think affordable housing is so high on the radar screen it's
going to be part of all the conversations," White said.</TE>
<TE>   The city owns 44 acres at 36 locations downtown, much of it
suitable for new construction, which would certainly include housing.
City officials this year created the Housing Roundtable, an advisory
committee that includes several developers. Lynn Jacobs, a developer
and round table member, said the city seems determined to take
advantage of a booming housing market.</TE>
<TE>   "The housing prices, and lack of housing supply, have really hit
Ventura County," she said. "So, projects that were not feasible five
years ago are now. And more expensive [business-residential]
mixed-use projects are possible because of the price of housing."</TE>
<TE>   The median price of a house in Ventura County has risen nearly
$150,000 since 1995, to $334,000. And it has spiked even higher in
the city of Ventura. There, Santa Barbara professionals are snatching
up houses as soon as they hit the market, because they are far
cheaper than in their city of employment.</TE>
<TE>   Planner Fulton said Ventura hasn't hit its stride yet. But word
that Olson and Mulokas have persevered through the city bureaucracy
will spread, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't make it easy, but in-fill developers found us anyway,"
he said. "This tells us there's definitely a market for small-town
urban living in coastal California."</TE>

<LD>An Oxnard couple and their friend have been arrested on suspicion of
possessing more than two pounds of cocaine and methamphetamine valued
by authorities at $30,000, officials said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Darryl and Isabel Warren, 35 and 27, were being held on suspicion
of possessing the drugs and possessing them for sale. Isabel Warren
was being held in lieu of $2-million bail and her husband in lieu of
$250,000 bail.</LD>
<LD>   Juan Ocampo, 49, of Oxnard was freed after posting a $50,000 bond.</LD>
<TE>   After a month of surveillance, Oxnard police officers last week
raided the Warrens' home in the 4400 block of Dallas Drive, seizing a
pound each of cocaine and methamphetamine.</TE>
<TE>   Five more ounces of methamphetamine were found in a car being used
by Darryl Warren and Ocampo and two more ounces of cocaine were found
at Ocampo's home in the 1700 block of Elsinore Avenue, police said.</TE>
<TE>   A combined $21,000 in suspected drug proceeds was also seized at

<LD>   The Old Christians rugby team had been on its way to Chile in

when their plane crashed south of Santiago. The 45 people aboard

<LD>Police said they suspected Maoist rebels fighting to bring down
Nepal's constitutional monarchy were behind an explosion that
destroyed a statue of the late King Mahendra, killed a bystander and
injured nine others.</LD>
<LD>   The attack came a day after Nepal's King Gyanendra appointed
Lokendra Bahadur Chand, a monarchist, as prime minister. Mahendra was

<LD>Peruvian archeologists have unearthed the first full Inca burial site
at Machu Picchu since the famous mountaintop citadel was discovered
90 years ago, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "It's important because nothing like this -- a burial site and all
that goes with it -- has been found since the Bingham era," said
Machu Picchu's administrator, Fernando Astete, referring to U.S.
explorer Hiram Bingham, who found the Inca citadel in 1911.</LD>
<LD>   Machu Picchu was built more than 500 years ago. When it was
discovered, 172 tombs with remains were found. But no more were found
until this one.</LD>

<HD>Jockeying for a Place in Modern Life</HD>
<DH>Camel racing fever runs high in Gulf states, where ruling
sheiks offer large cash prizes. But the sport has been touched by
scandal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tony Perry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>AL SHAHHANIYA, Qatar</DL>
<LD>The whistle blows and a dozen Arabian camels, snorting and straining,
begin galloping down a sandy track under a blistering sun.</LD>
<LD>   Camel handlers, who brought the braying and moaning animals to the
starting line, scurry to keep from being trampled or kicked.
Barefoot, pint-sized jockeys hold on for dear life and maneuver for
position as the pack surges forward and quickly is out of sight.</LD>
<LD>   As the Persian Gulf region rushes headlong into modernity with
satellite communications and international business deals, the
ancient sport of camel racing is enjoying a renaissance. But even it
is being updated for the 21st century.</LD>
<TE>   "Camel racing is part of us, something everyone can enjoy," said
Mana Qahtani, a TV commentator at a recent Friday race held here at
the conclusion of midafternoon Islamic prayers.</TE>
<TE>   Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, is the center of camel racing
enthusiasm. The televised races in early spring are said to engender
as much enthusiasm as the March Madness caused by the college
basketball finals in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The sheik of Dubai reportedly owns 10,000 camels; a camel hospital
there has swimming pools for camels undergoing therapy. A dozen new
racetracks have been built in the region in the last decade. And a
breeding female recently sold in Dubai for more than $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Qatari emir, Sheik Hamad ibn Khalifa al Thani, is promoting
camel races as a way to honor tradition while continuing a
Western-leaning drive toward modernization. At his direction, a
sprawling facility for housing and training camels recently opened
adjacent to the track here at Al Shahhaniya, in the vast desert
outside the capital, Doha. The sheik and his family are frequent
spectators.</TE>
<TE>   Although wagering is banned in these Muslim countries, interest in
the races is spiked by handsome prizes offered by the ruling sheiks.
First place in a highly publicized race can pay $1 million or more.</TE>
<TE>   "It is like any sport, like your Super Bowl--when there is more
money, there is more interest," Qahtani said.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the big prizes and high-tech facilities, camel racing even
has a touch of scandal.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations and human rights groups in Britain and Pakistan
have decried the trafficking in camel jockeys--some as young as 4. In
some instances, boys from Pakistan and Bangladesh have been kidnapped
and forced into servitude as jockeys. In other cases, impoverished
families have sold their children to middlemen who indentured them to
the racing industry.</TE>
<TE>   A report issued in March by the State Department on human rights
practices concluded of Qatar: "Guardians and handlers, who often pose
as parents, bring the children into the country and supervise their
training. They live in difficult conditions and train on a daily
basis to become riders."</TE>
<TE>   Stung by the criticism, the Emirates Camel Racing Foundation,
which supervises racing in the region, has promised a ban on riders
younger than 14. The United Arab Emirates has vowed to enforce a 1993
law barring underage jockeys. And Qatar's Supreme Council for Family
Affairs has said eliminating "camel kids" is a priority; it has
launched a public relations campaign warning camel owners not to hire
the very young.</TE>
<TE>   Though cause for concern, the scandal has not diminished the
popularity of camel racing--if television coverage is any barometer.</TE>
<TE>   At the races here, two camera crews followed the camels from
inside the five-kilometer oval track, providing split-screen images
of the leaders and the rest of the pack.</TE>
<TE>   Races are shown tape-delayed on Qatari television, sometimes for
several nights running. "People cannot get enough of it," said Rajab
Ali Abaei, an official with the Heyen Racing Committee, which
organizes the races. On one recent day, most of the handlers and
jockeys were Bedouins from Sudan, who have been camel masters for
centuries. The jockeys wore faded silks and headgear that looked like
skateboard helmets.</TE>
<TE>   Races are divided according to the age and sex of the camels,
which can be 6 feet high at the shoulder and weigh 1,500 pounds.
Among younger animals, males are faster; later in life, females often
have the edge.</TE>
<TE>   Without individual stalls at the starting line, the one-hump
dromedaries and their handlers jostle for position as post time
nears. The jockeys are hoisted onto the camels' backs at the last
moment, sitting behind the hump on small blankets.</TE>
<TE>   The start is controlled chaos, with camels bumping and bawling,
the jockeys applying tiny whips to the animals' shoulders, and the
handlers racing for safety. Those who get kicked or stepped on are
scooped up by a waiting ambulance.</TE>
<TE>   The animals start fast, then settle into the rolling gait that
earned them the nickname "ships of the desert." Smart jockeys wait
until the finish to urge the beast for more speed. A race takes about
10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Several dozen Land Cruisers, Land Rovers and Escalades race
alongside the camels, inside the track. In the SUVs are male members
of the Qatari upper class, camel racing fans all.</TE>
<TE>   There is no grandstand like at an American horse racing track, but
for Qataris unwilling to wait for the television coverage--and unable
to ride along--the TV pictures are immediately beamed into a
structure that looks like an American portable classroom. Fans sit
inside, sipping sweet tea, cheering their favorites.</TE>
<TE>   "Camel racing is part of our past," said Abdul Lootah, an
international business consultant who was watching the races. "It
reminds us who we are."</TE>

<HD>Near Disaster in '62 Missile Crisis Comes to Light</HD>
<DH>Key figures, meeting in Havana to revisit events, learn
that a U.S. destroyer almost hit a nuclear-armed Soviet sub by
accident.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HAVANA</DL>
<LD>Key figures in the 1962 Cuban missile crisis meeting here Saturday
have learned that events 40 years ago nearly spun out of control and
brought them closer to nuclear disaster than they had imagined.</LD>
<LD>   Studying newly declassified documents at a conference on the
crisis, Cuban, American and Russian protagonists were told that the
most dangerous day was Oct. 27, 1962 -- when a U.S. Navy destroyer
dropping depth charges off the Cuban coast accidentally almost hit
the hull of a Soviet submarine that was carrying a nuclear warhead.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. military "did not have a clue that the submarine had a
nuclear weapon on board," Thomas Blanton, director of the National
Security Archives, told reporters Friday night.</LD>
<TE>   The nonprofit archive at George Washington University collected
many of the documents for study during the three-day conference on
the crisis. The meeting started Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The depth charges "exploded right next to the hull," Vadim Orlov,
the submarine's signals intelligence officer, said in a written
account of the incident. "It felt like you were sitting in a metal
barrel, which somebody is constantly blasting with a sledgehammer."</TE>
<TE>   At first, submarine crew members considered using the nuclear
weapon, thinking that war had erupted, Orlov wrote. But they
ultimately surfaced, showing themselves to the Americans and defusing
the tension.</TE>
<TE>   Another document showed that U.S. intelligence officials had
photographed only 33 of the 42 medium-range missiles in Cuba that the
Americans later discovered were there at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence officials also never found any nuclear warheads,
which they later learned had been kept on the island.</TE>
<TE>   The historic papers underscored the danger of a nuclear attack --
either accidental or deliberate -- that existed during those tense
days.</TE>
<TE>   Anatoly Dobrynin, former Soviet ambassador to the United States,
quoted then-U.S. Atty. Gen. Robert F. Kennedy as telling him in a
top-secret memo, now declassified, on Oct. 27, 1962, that a war could
begin "in which millions of Americans and Russians will die."</TE>
<TE>   Cuban President Fidel Castro participated in the conference's
closed sessions Friday and Saturday, as did former Defense Secretary
Robert S. McNamara.</TE>
<TE>   Later, the former rivals said goodbye with a warm handshake as
McNamara left Havana calling for an end to "the risk of destruction
of nations by nuclear weapons."</TE>
<TE>   "That risk is unacceptable today," he said. The missile crisis
began in mid-October 1962 when President Kennedy learned that Cuba
had Soviet nuclear missiles capable of reaching the United States.
The crisis was defused two weeks later when the Soviet Union agreed
to remove the missiles.</TE>

<HD>Falwell Apologizes After Remarks Enrage Muslims</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Conservative U.S. preacher Jerry Falwell apologized Saturday for
calling the prophet Muhammad a terrorist, saying he meant no
disrespect to "any sincere, law-abiding Muslim."</LD>
<LD>   The apology came after top Iranian and British officials condemned
the remarks, which Falwell made last week in an interview on CBS' "60
Minutes."</LD>
<LD>   "I think Muhammad was a terrorist ... a man of war," Falwell said
in the interview.</LD>
<TE>   The comments angered Muslims around the world, triggering
Hindu-Muslim clashes in India that left at least nine people dead.</TE>
<TE>   Iranian cleric Mohsen Mojtahed Shabestari, addressing Friday
prayers in the northwestern town of Tabriz, said Falwell was a
"mercenary and must be killed," the Persian-language daily Abrar
reported Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   In Lebanon on Saturday, Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah
called on Muslim countries to respond to Falwell who, he said, had
"infringed on the prophet's dignity." Fadlallah cautioned against
resorting to violence.</TE>

<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Several thousand antiwar activists chanted, "No blood for oil,"
Saturday as they marched to protest possible military action against
Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Amid a heavy police presence, demonstrators carried a large banner
that read "No to war in Iraq; justice and peace in the Middle East,"
as they made their way from Place de la Republique to Place de la
Nation in eastern Paris.</LD>
<LD>   Police said 6,000 people took part in the protest. Smaller
demonstrations were staged in about 30 other cities across France.
About 300 people took to the streets of Lyon, while 200 turned out in
Marseille, police said.</LD>
<TE>   Green Party lawmaker Noel Mamere told reporters that he hoped the
demonstration would "help those in the United States who are
criticizing the policies" of President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Mamere charged that the main goal of the war would be to control

<HD>Pentagon Orders Key Marine, Army Staffs to Kuwait</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a move that suggests Pentagon preparations for a possible war
against Iraq, key Army and Marine Corps battle staffs are being sent
to Kuwait, two officials familiar with the planning said. Several
thousand U.S. personnel already are in Kuwait.</LD>
<LD>   The Pentagon has taken numerous steps in recent weeks to position
U.S. forces to reduce the time required to launch an attack on Iraq,
should President Bush decide to do so.</LD>
<LD>   In the latest move, the battle staffs of the Army's V Corps, with
headquarters at Heidelberg, Germany, and the Marine Corps' 1st Marine
Expeditionary Force, based at Camp Pendleton, Calif., were ordered to
Kuwait, the two officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Those moves strongly suggest that Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld is putting in place the battle planners and command staffs
that would be called on to spearhead any assault on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The V Corps is the Army's only corps headquarters based outside
the United States, and its combat units, including the 1st Armored
Division and the 1st Infantry Division, are specifically trained to
fight in Europe or the Middle East. The V Corps is commanded by Lt.
Gen. William Wallace and has 41,000 troops.</TE>
<TE>   The battle staff of the U.S. Central Command, which would have
overall responsibility for war in Iraq, is planning to move to an air
base in Qatar next month from its headquarters in Tampa, Fla. The
move is billed as an exercise, but officials say the staff may remain
in Qatar.</TE>
<TE>   In Baghdad, meanwhile, Iraq's Foreign Minister Naji Sabri briefed
parliament Saturday on U.S. war threats and Washington's attempts to
pass a tough United Nations resolution on arms inspections, the Iraqi
News Agency said.</TE>
<TE>   The report said Sabri had briefed the 250-member parliament "on
the dimensions of the rude American threats to launch a new
aggression against Iraq under false pretexts."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, about 500 Iraqi Muslim clerics and scholars issued a
religious edict calling on Muslims to launch a holy war to "burn the
earth under the feet" of the United States if it attacked Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi authorities also took foreign journalists to a site
suspected by Washington to be involved in Baghdad's alleged nuclear
program. Officials told the reporters at the Al-Furat site, about 16
miles from Baghdad, that it was a center to develop electronics for
conventional weapons, such as radars, activity not banned by U.N.
resolutions.</TE>

<HD>Ivory Coast Defense Minister Ousted</HD>
<DH>The removal of hard-line official had been among rebels'
demands. Battle near key town stirs fears about cocoa industry.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>DALOA, Ivory Coast</DL>
<LD>Fighting near a key town of Ivory Coast's cocoa industry raised fears
of spreading turmoil as the defense minister who had vowed to quell a
3-week-old rebellion was stripped of his portfolio.</LD>
<LD>   A West African envoy was scheduled to make another visit today to
a stronghold of the Patriotic Movement of Ivory Coast rebels, whose
war has left hundreds dead and displaced tens of thousands.</LD>
<LD>   Residents of Daloa, about 200 miles northwest of the main city of
Abidjan, heard fighting on the northern edge of the city, but after
night fell and a curfew came into force they were unsure who was in
charge.</LD>
<TE>   Security officers said they were too busy to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The rebel advance during the week sent world cocoa prices to near
17-year peaks on fears of disruption to exports from the world's
biggest producer. Daloa is a key hub for the cocoa industry. It also
stands at the boundary between the Christian south that largely
supports President Laurent Gbagbo and the rebel-held Muslim north.</TE>
<TE>   Hard-line Defense Minister Moise Lida Kouassi was stripped of his
portfolio Saturday and replaced by former Cabinet director Kadie Gaye
Bertin.</TE>
<TE>   Kouassi, who kept his rank and moved to a job in the president's
office, was widely seen as one of those close to Gbagbo who favored a
military solution to the conflict and opposed talks with the rebels
before they disarmed.</TE>
<TE>   The removal of Kouassi had been among the demands of rebels who
agreed to a West African-brokered cease-fire this month.</TE>
<TE>   Hopes of that truce collapsed when Gbagbo refused to sign it until
the rebels gave up their weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Senegalese Foreign Minister Cheikh Tidiane Gadio is in Ivory Coast
to try to restart mediation.</TE>
<TE>   Gadio has held talks with Gbagbo and on Saturday flew to Bouake,
about 190 miles north of Abidjan, to meet with the rebel commanders
for more than two hours. The envoy is to return there today.</TE>
<TE>   A top rebel commander, Cherif Ousmane, described the meeting with
Gadio as positive and said the group had dropped its precondition of
Gbagbo's resignation for moving the peace process forward.</TE>

<HD>Kuwait Says It Foiled More Attacks</HD>
<DH>The emirate arrests 15 citizens suspected of indirect ties
to Al Qaeda after attack on Marines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>KUWAIT CITY</DL>
<LD>Kuwait said Saturday that it had foiled attacks against Western
targets in the oil-rich state by arresting a group of suspects who
had formed a cell with indirect links to Al Qaeda.</LD>
<LD>   Two key members of the cell, who had trained in Al Qaeda terrorist
camps in Afghanistan, were killed Tuesday during an attack on U.S.
Marines training on a Kuwaiti island, Kuwait said.</LD>
<LD>   The two killed one Marine, Lance Cpl. Antonio J. Sledd, and
wounded another in what Kuwait called a "terrorist act."</LD>
<TE>   "We discovered other plots and targets, American and foreign....
We succeeded in foiling what they were planning to do," Interior
Minister Sheik Mohammed Khaled al Hamad al Sabah told a news
conference.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had not arrived in time ... many other things would have
happened."</TE>
<TE>   He said 15 Kuwaiti suspects and an unspecified number of other
people had been referred to the public prosecutor's office in an
investigation after Tuesday's shootings.</TE>
<TE>   Khaled said the case was now complete. He refused to show
confessions or give details of five potential targets to protect
national security, but he said blueprints were found with the
suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Security sources said the suspects' plans included plots to attack
an oil tanker and an entertainment park near the military base used
by the U.S. at Camp Doha.</TE>
<TE>   According to Khaled, the defendants said Anas Kandari, one of the
two killed during the attack on the Marines, "is their emir and he
paid allegiance to [Osama] bin Laden."</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot say for certain about the defendants, [but] they follow
their emir," Khaled added.</TE>
<TE>   He said that "we have no proof this cell of 15 ... have links
outside of Kuwait."</TE>
<TE>   The two attackers, however, had traveled to Afghanistan and had
trained in camps run by Bin Laden's Al Qaeda network.</TE>
<TE>   Scores of Muslim Arabs, including Bin Laden, traveled to
Afghanistan to join in the struggle against the Soviet occupation of
that country in the 1980s.</TE>

<HD>Getting to the Roots of London</HD>
<DH>A stone plaque offers the earliest physical proof of the
Romans' naming of the city.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>A 2,000-year-old stone plaque engraved with the oldest Roman naming
of London has been unearthed on a building site, archeologists said.</LD>
<LD>   Experts believe the 12-by-16-inch plaque, engraved with the Latin
word "Londiniensium," is the earliest known physical proof of the
capital's original Roman name.</LD>
<LD>   Dating from about AD 150, the remarkably well-preserved stone was
discovered on a building site for new homes in Southwark, South
London.</LD>
<TE>   The plaque was uncovered Oct. 3 and will be displayed at the
Museum of London. Experts believe that it is a dedication from
Tiberinius Celerianus, the moritex, or chief trade negotiator, from
the area.</TE>
<TE>   "The inscription shows London's significance as a trading center,"
Nansi Rosenborg, senior archeological consultant with building
consultancy EC Harris, said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Archeologists provided a translation:</TE>
<TE>   "To the spirits of the emperors [and] the God Mars Camulos,
Tiberinius Celerianus, ranking moritex of the [traders] of London."</TE>

<DL>RAFAH, Gaza Strip</DL>
<LD>An Israeli army raid in the Gaza Strip today killed two Palestinians,
including a 3-year-old boy in his bed when troops blew up a house
next door, witnesses and medics said.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli security sources said troops were looking for
arms-smuggling tunnels used by Palestinian militants in the border
city of Rafah and said they blew up two houses where exits of tunnels
from Egyptian territory were found.</LD>
<LD>   Soldiers evacuated both houses before the demolition, the security
sources said. But Palestinians said the blast brought down walls of
nearby homes, killing the boy.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier, Palestinian medics said Ibrahim Alghuti, 26, was killed

<HD>EU Observers Report a Flawed Poll in Pakistan</HD>
<DH>Monitors of the general election criticize the Musharraf
regime and question whether the military will allow true transfer to
civilian rule.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Watson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>European observers sharply criticized President Pervez Musharraf's
government Saturday for a range of flaws in last week's general
election and questioned whether the military will allow real civilian
rule in Pakistan.</LD>
<LD>   A team of European Union observers scrutinized the promised
transition to civilian democracy by Musharraf -- an army general who
seized power in a 1999 bloodless coup -- for 10 weeks before
Thursday's vote. Their report supported opposition complaints of
widespread manipulation.</LD>
<LD>   While he blamed a succession of civilian and military governments
for failing to foster true democracy in Pakistan, chief election
observer John Cushnahan said he doubted that Musharraf's plan is much
different.</LD>
<TE>   "Any abuse of power, whether for monetary gain or anything else,
should be addressed by firm and impartial application of the rule of
law, not by unjustified interference with electoral arrangements and
the democratic process," Cushnahan said. "Regrettably, in choosing
the latter course, the Pakistan authorities engaged in a course of
action which resulted in serious flaws in the electoral process."</TE>
<TE>   With most votes counted Saturday, no single party had won enough
seats in the 342-member National Assembly to form a government
without support from coalition partners. That means a new government
can emerge only after hard bargaining, and covert U.S. operations in
Pakistan in the war against terrorism are likely to be one of the
issues on the table.</TE>
<TE>   The pro-Musharraf Pakistan Muslim League-Q had the most seats,
with 78. The Pakistan People's Party of former Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto, who is in self-exile in London to avoid prison on corruption
charges, had 62 seats. A loose alliance of six anti-American Muslim
parties, the Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal, or United Council of Action,
had 45.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 342 seats in the assembly, 272 are elected by constituents
while the rest are reserved for women and minorities.</TE>
<TE>   As the third-largest contingent in the legislature, the Islamic
front is not guaranteed a role in the federal government. But to shut
it out completely, the pro-Musharraf PML-Q would have to form a
coalition with its political archenemy, Bhutto's party.</TE>
<TE>   An accommodation with the mullahs, who have long had ties to the
Pakistani military, would probably be easier to negotiate. The
Islamic front won an outright majority in the provincial assembly in
North-West Frontier Province, and it might also hold the balance of
power in the provincial government in Baluchistan.</TE>
<TE>   Both territories border Afghanistan and are crucial to U.S.-led
efforts to capture Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters believed to be using
Pakistani border areas as rear bases for a guerrilla war in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Islamic front leader Shah Ahmed Noorani predicted that
the religious parties would lead a coalition government in Pakistan.
But despite the Islamic alliance's public support for the ousted
Taliban regime in neighboring Afghanistan, Pakistani clerics have
said any moves they would make against what they consider vulgar
Western cultural influences, such as cable TV, would be gradual.</TE>
<TE>   Support for Islamic candidates was so strong that the former
leader of a banned militant group won a seat in the National Assembly
while locked up in a jail cell. Azam Tariq headed the outlawed
Sipah-e-Sahaba, a Sunni Muslim organization blamed for scores of
terrorist attacks aimed at minority Shiite Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf's government hasn't said publicly what it plans to do
about the election of Tariq, who ran as an independent. But
Musharraf's opponents have accused his military's powerful
Inter-Services Intelligence agency of waging a secret campaign to
weaken mainstream parties and promote his allies. That may have
backfired by opening the way to sweeping gains by Islamic parties,
which oppose Musharraf's alliance with the U.S. in the war on
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   In his report, Cushnahan, a member of the European Parliament from
Belfast, Northern Ireland, echoed the concerns of Pakistani
opposition parties and human rights activists who say the military
plans to wield significant power over the new civilian government.</TE>
<TE>   The "restoration of democracy in this country is about the
transfer of power from a military to a civilian administration,"
Cushnahan said in the report. "The powers that have been reserved to
the president and the National Security Council raise serious
questions as to whether or not this will happen."</TE>
<TE>   The EU observers concluded that Musharraf imposed new election
rules to keep Bhutto and exiled former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif,
the country's two best-known politicians, out of the race. Those
decrees "were based on questionable legal grounds and clearly had a
negative impact on the overall electoral process," the report said.</TE>
<TE>   The observers found that Pakistan's election commission, which is
supposed to be independent, "failed to curb the authorities' misuse
of state resources in favor of political parties," including the
PML-Q. Government-imposed restrictions "seriously hampered the
abilities of parties and candidates to campaign and contributed to
the lackluster pre-polling period," the report concluded.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the PML-Q and the Islamic front got much more
coverage on state-run television than mainstream opposition parties,
the observers found.</TE>
<TE>   "Broadcasts containing dissent or criticism of the authorities
were the exception rather than the rule," the report said. "The
administration was often given free rein on state television to
criticize the behavior of past political rulers, including President
Musharraf's inappropriate eve-of-election televised address to the
nation."</TE>

<DL>MANILA</DL>
<LD>Fierce clashes between Philippine marines and Abu Sayyaf rebels on
the southern island of Jolo left at least 11 soldiers dead and 26
others wounded, military officials said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Government bombers and attack helicopters took turns blasting
suspected positions of an Abu Sayyaf faction believed to be holding
hostage four Jehovah's Witnesses, all women, the officials added.
There were no immediate reports on rebel casualties.</LD>
<LD>   The women were abducted Aug. 20 while selling Avon cosmetics in a
remote village on the troubled island. There were no reports about
the women's fate. Three Indonesian tugboat crewmen also are being
held by the Muslim extremists.</LD>
<TE>   Philippine military officials said the marines encountered what
they believed to be a large group of Abu Sayyaf along with followers
of Nur Misuari, a former governor of an autonomous Muslim region now
in jail for allegedly fomenting rebellion.</TE>
<TE>   Other marines deployed elsewhere on Jolo were sent to the area.</TE>
<TE>   The guerrillas have split into smaller groups and are engaging the
soldiers in scattered gun battles in the jungle, military sources
said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. military support helped Philippine troops debilitate the Abu
Sayyaf over the summer on Basilan island, but Manila now is fighting
an Abu Sayyaf faction on another island, Sulu.</TE>

<HD>In Kabul, Big Changes Among Small Business</HD>
<DH>Shops that lacked customers under the Taliban are filling
with patrons. Some Afghans, however, worry about the social
ramifications.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Dixon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>At dawn, Sharif, 58, Kabul's most famous kebab man, goes to buy the
best cut of meat and never even haggles about the price. By 12:30
p.m. his kebabs will be sold out, and waiters in his tiny
smoked-filled restaurant will have to turn hungry and disappointed
people away.</LD>
<LD>   Mohammed Hasan, 55, who has been tailor to kings and government
officials for decades, is doing so well, he had to hang a sign in his
shop, warning off new customers.</LD>
<LD>   On colorful Flower Street, shopkeepers who used to spend their
days joking and singing for lack of customers, now are happily
besieged by patrons and traffic jams.</LD>
<TE>   From the poorest carpet weaver to the fat car dealers in Charai
Ansari Square, everyone in Kabul says small-scale commerce is
humming.</TE>
<TE>   "Now finally I am making money," Sharif said. "It's really the
first time I have made a lot of money."</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan's economy, shattered by 23 years of war, is gloomy and
depressed, so primitive that no one in the government knows the
unemployment rate or the balance of trade. They can only guess at the
figures, but they know the numbers are bad.</TE>
<TE>   In the post-Taliban era, the striking thing here in the Afghan
capital, however, is the thriving entrepreneurial spirit of the
small-business men.</TE>
<TE>   Street life in Kabul is dazzling. Gaudy wedding cars race by and
elaborately painted trucks lumber about with people perched on top.
One recent hot autumn day a foolhardy roller-blader weaved through
the crazy traffic.</TE>
<TE>   But beneath the surface, Kabul seems poised between a giant leap
into the future, full of optimism and risk, and an abrupt retreat
from social change.</TE>
<TE>   Businesses restricted or banned under the Taliban -- tailors,
beauticians, music shops, photographers -- are swinging along. Even
those that faced no direct restrictions, like restaurants and car
traders, are much busier and more profitable.</TE>
<TE>   The Taliban managed to shut out the world. Now, satellite TV is
here, an Internet cafe has opened. Crowds of men in restaurants and
cafes stare at television screens where scantily clad Indian dancers
gyrate hypnotically. But not everyone has adapted to the changes.
Religious authorities fear the impact on Afghanistan's Islamic
values. As Kabul whirls through a carnival of change and choice, some
are confused, bemused, shocked.</TE>
<TE>   Sher Mohammed, 36, from Ghorband is too afraid and uncertain to
venture far from his hotel in central Kabul. He came to the capital
to find medical treatment for his ailing 5-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   At a restaurant Mohammed visited, football and dancing blared on
TV. "I don't like it, why should I tell a lie? And I don't like the
nude pictures I saw at a video seller's," he complained.</TE>
<TE>   Still, others are enjoying, and profiting from, a small-business
boom.</TE>
<TE>   Lunchtime kebab and rice houses are packed. Ice-cream parlors are
thriving, trucking grimy ice from the Salang Gorge to freeze their
confections by hand, or buying ice from factories. Florists and
bakers are deluged with wedding orders, a far cry from the Taliban
days when the middle classes would go to Pakistan for important,
festive parties.</TE>
<TE>   Mir Gulab, 70, whose turban business has been in the family for
100 years, is making the same kind of money he did in the era of the
Taliban, when every bureaucrat wore a turban. Now, however, he sells
more turbans to rural buyers who had not been able to afford new
turbans in the Taliban era.</TE>
<TE>   "Actually, business is good. Everyone is richer now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   When Nazar Mohammed, 45, saw four turban sellers go broke after
the Taliban's fall, he nearly gave up his own turban business. But
instead he diversified into vests and waistcoats and pulled his
business out of a hole.</TE>
<TE>   "It's getting better, day by day," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sharif, the kebab shop man who has no second name but is known by
everyone as Sharif Kebabi, began as an apprentice making kebabs at
13, and opened his own business at 19.</TE>
<TE>   After the Russians invaded in 1979, he hung a portrait of the
Soviet space hero Yuri Gagarin on the wall and welcomed lots of
Russian customers. His grimmest era was under the Taliban, when the
religious police stormed through the neighborhood every lunchtime,
forcing people away to pray.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, I could just work to support my family, not make money. I
worked for years and could never buy a decent piece of furniture,"
said Sharif, who sits cross-legged in the front of this restaurant
each day counting the take. "Everyone wants to progress. Everyone
wants to move forward."</TE>
<TE>   The scrawled sign hanging in tailor Mohammed Hasan's shop tells
the story of the roaring demand for his Western-style suits since the
fall of the Taliban: "Dear customers," it reads, "Because of a
shortage of apprentices we cannot accept sewing orders."</TE>
<TE>   He began as an apprentice 48 years ago, at age 7. Now Hasan sews
suits only for top government officials, foreigners and loyal
customers. He is making 60 suits a month now, compared with six in
the Taliban era. He makes about $60 a month. "This work does not make
you rich, but it does bring satisfaction, honor, fame," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even at the lowest, toughest level among the children who weave
carpets, life is better now. Ahmad Faisal, 14, and his four sisters
begin the intricate and dull work of carpet weaving at dawn, but at
night when it's too dark to work, the electric light shining from the
neighbor's window is enough to study their schoolwork.</TE>
<TE>   Children in weaving families attend school three or four hours a
day, unlike in the Taliban era when neither boys nor girls from such
families went. With Ahmad and his four sisters, ages 7 to 16, at
school, it's a big sacrifice in the family's potential income, but
they make $100 a month, enough to survive.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the lost income, going to school is a big improvement,
said Ahmad, who became the family breadwinner at 6 when his father
was killed by a rocket in Afghanistan's civil war eight years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "My neighbor has electricity, and I can sit outside his house and
use the light to study," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The return of refugees to Kabul has made finding housing difficult
so the family has been living in one room these last three months,
with no doors or windows, bathroom, kitchen or power.</TE>
<TE>   Although unemployment is high in Kabul, there are ways to scrape
out a living, sometimes literally. On the outskirts of the city, dirt
is free.</TE>
<TE>   Abdul Wasy, 15, and his brothers toil in the baking sun, shoveling
thick clay from a hole in the ground for bricks, making four times as
many as they did just eight months ago.</TE>
<TE>   The teenager and his siblings Abdul Rafi, 13, and Abdul Wali, 11,
the sons of a Taliban military official who died of illness last
year, come after school to work. They make $100 a month to feed their
12-member family.</TE>
<TE>   As returning refugees rebuild ruined houses around Kabul, demand
for bricks has quadrupled since the brothers began work eight months
ago; now they make 1,000 bricks a day. The number of brick makers has
doubled in that time, Abdul Wasy estimated.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't have money for the family, and we saw people doing it
and we decided to do it too," he explained. "It's tough work. But we
are poor people. We have to do this."</TE>
<TE>   Amid Kabul's immense social upheaval, trade can be unpredictable.</TE>
<TE>   In one of Kabul's prestige car dealer shops, a young man sleeps
open-mouthed in a Land Cruiser. The owner of the shop, Abdullah
Alemi, 36, who started at age 14 or 15 selling Russian Moskvitch
cars, draws his legs onto a shabby couch to sit cross-legged,
revealing the holes in his socks.</TE>
<TE>   His business was roaring in the immediate aftermath of the
Taliban's fall, when new government officials and foreign
organizations ordered 50 cars a month. Now he sells 10 to 15,
compared with one a month in the Taliban era.</TE>
<TE>   Sales are still good, but his profit is declining because he has
to pay customs duties three times: once to the central government and
twice to regional Afghan governors who control the areas his cars
have to pass through on the way from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.</TE>
<TE>   His partner, Izmarai, 39, who like many Afghans goes by one name,
said the multiple customs payments, along with lack of security and
the large number of competing car dealerships that has sprung up
since the Taliban left, were their biggest problems.</TE>
<TE>   "The government is not in full control of Afghanistan," Izmarai
said, complaining that the central authorities could not prevent
regional governors from demanding customs duties.</TE>
<TE>   "Security is the most important thing. We hope things will get
better. The government is trying to form a national army and police
force."</TE>
<TE>   His partner chimed in: "The competition has more than doubled
since the Taliban left. Our business is declining. We don't know how
bad it will get.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is in the same position. They're dizzy and wondering.
They don't know whether they'll make money or lose it."</TE>
<TE>   Sprouting up weeks after the Taliban fled last November were the
video rental shops, a business that seemed a sure-fire moneymaker.</TE>
<TE>   Hamidullah, 32, who goes by one name, took a cousin's advice and
gave up a profitable car detailing business to put all his money into
a video rental shop, only to find that many others had the same idea.
Worse, electricity in his neighborhood was so sporadic that few
people could rent videos.</TE>
<TE>   "The Taliban was very good for my first business. They had so many
cars. We were always repairing the seats on their cars. And they
always paid on time.</TE>
<TE>   "The other business was better, but I'll forgive my cousin. It's
not his fault," he said ruefully. "It's just fate."</TE>

<HD>The Army's Looking for a Few Good Arabic Speakers</HD>
<DH>A proposal calls for recruiting Middle Easterners to fill
its ranks of linguists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Faced with a critical shortage of native Arabic speakers, the Army is
considering recruiting Middle Easterners into the ranks of its elite
Special Forces, defense officials say.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal, which would require congressional approval, has not
yet been endorsed by top Army leaders or the Pentagon.</LD>
<LD>   The Army's interest reflects the seriousness of a problem that
looms large in the global war on terrorism: The Special Forces are
stretched thin, particularly in Arab linguists.</LD>
<TE>   Placing foreigners in the Special Forces has precedent. It was
done in the 1950s under the Lodge Act, designed as a mechanism for
raising a "foreign legion" of Soviet-bloc expatriates during a time
when many in Washington believed that the Soviet Union would invade
Western Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Although thousands of applicants under the Lodge Act were
rejected, at least 230 anti-communist Eastern Europeans were brought
into the first Special Forces unit, the 10th Special Forces Group, in
1952, according to historian Kenn Finlayson. He said the historical
record is not clear on when or why the practice ended.</TE>
<TE>   About 5,500 soldiers serve in the five active-duty Special Forces
groups. A few hundred operated in the combat phase of the war in
Afghanistan, advising and leading anti-Taliban forces and directing
U.S. airstrikes.</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear how many foreigners the Army believes it needs to
supplement the Special Forces, which are only one segment of the
military's special operations branch. Other segments include Army
Rangers, Navy SEALs, Air Force Special Operations troops and the
Army's Night Stalker aviators.</TE>
<TE>   Army Lt. Col. Rivers Johnson, a Pentagon spokesman, said the Army
Special Operations Command is developing a legislative proposal
similar to the Lodge Act but emphasizing areas such as the Middle
East or Central Asia, where U.S. operatives do not easily blend in.</TE>
<TE>   The Army's interest in recruiting foreigners into Special Forces
raises many sensitive political issues, any of which could scuttle
the proposal before it reaches Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld.</TE>
<TE>   One is security. Could the Army adequately guard against hostile
Arab nations planting spies in the Special Forces' ranks?</TE>
<TE>   Also, how would foreigners, however well qualified, obtain the
necessary security clearances for handling classified information?</TE>
<TE>   Michael Vickers, a former Special Forces soldier and former CIA
officer, said he sees promise in the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Vickers said in an interview, "It's not just linguists -- it's
also the cultural awareness" that the force is lacking in the Middle
East.</TE>
<TE>   The only Army Special Forces group that focuses specifically on
the Middle East and Central Asia is the 5th Special Forces Group,
based at Ft. Campbell, Ky. But it has too few people with both the
language skills and ethnicity that would allow them to function
effectively in hostile Arab areas.</TE>

<HD>Ukrainians Seek Leader's Ouster</HD>
<DH>Inquiry targets Leonid D. Kuchma for allegedly approving
the sale of a radar system to Iraq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>KIEV, Ukraine</DL>
<LD>Tens of thousands of Ukrainians rallied Saturday in the second
nationwide demonstration in a month seeking to oust President Leonid
D. Kuchma, who is under investigation for allegedly approving arms
sales to Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Protesters waving banners and chanting, "Away with Kuchma,"
marched behind former Deputy Prime Minister Julia Tymoshenko,
Communist Party leader Petro Symonenko and Socialist Party leader
Oleksandr Moroz.</LD>
<LD>   Opposition groups and ordinary Ukrainians accuse Kuchma's
administration of corruption, chronic abuse of office and
vote-rigging that have smothered democratic rule and impoverished
this former Soviet republic.</LD>
<TE>   The protest was held a day before the expected arrival of a
U.S.-British team to investigate whether Ukraine sold radar systems
to Iraq with Kuchma's blessing.</TE>
<TE>   Kuchma is also accused by the opposition of curbing free speech
and political activity, as well as involvement in the killing of an
investigative journalist.</TE>
<TE>   Kuchma, 64, denies all the charges.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller protests took place Saturday in other major cities
throughout Ukraine, according to news reports.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. State Department said last month that it had verified the
authenticity of parts of a July 2000 recording by Kuchma's former
bodyguard in which the leader allegedly is heard approving the sale
of a Kolchuga system to Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   As night fell Saturday, opposition leaders marched with protesters
to the prosecutor general's office to deliver a list of 35 criminal
charges they want the courts to press against Kuchma, who was invited
to defend himself in front of about 20,000 demonstrators in the
capital.</TE>
<TE>   "For the crimes he's committed against the country ... Kuchma
deserves the highest punishment: life in prison," said Hryhoriy
Omelchenko, head of the parliamentary committee investigating
corruption.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot breathe, live and think freely. It is impossible in
Kuchma's state," said Sergei Golovaty, a parliament deputy.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman said Kuchma would not appear because he was busy
with official business.</TE>

<HD>Davis' Picks Look a Lot Like Wilson's</HD>
<DH>Appointees requiring Senate approval are fairly alike in
terms of gender and race, records show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Morain</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- In gender and racial makeup, Gov. Gray Davis'
appointees who require Senate approval are not much different from
those of Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican criticized by minorities for
his opposition to affirmative action and illegal immigration, Senate
records show.</LD>
<LD>   Davis appointments secretary Michael Yamaki disputes the
statistics, saying that limiting the analysis to appointees who
require Senate approval excludes hundreds of others named to Cabinet
posts, judgeships and scores of boards and commissions.</LD>
<LD>   State Sen. Gloria Romero (D-Los Angeles), a member of the Senate
Rules Committee, which must review nearly 600 appointees to more than
75 boards and commissions, is questioning the ethnic and gender
makeup of boards and commissions.</LD>
<TE>   "The administration, it seems, does not take the necessary steps
to ensure that persons of color are provided adequate opportunities
to serve the public as gubernatorial appointees," Romero said in a
letter to Latino lawmakers earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   She sent a similar letter to women lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   Romero stopped short of concluding that the bulk of the
appointments go to white men because they are the ones who contribute
most campaign money. But in an interview, she said: "Maybe it is time
to ask additional questions: Have they contributed, and how much?"</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Ross Johnson of Irvine, the lead Republican on the Rules
Committee, also noticed the composition of Davis' appointees: "The
general impression is that we're confirming an awful lot of white
men. It is dramatically out of line with the rhetoric of the
governor."</TE>
<TE>   The Senate's count, based on information supplied by the Davis
administration, shows that of his 592 appointees requiring Senate
confirmation, 28.9% were women, 10.6% were Latino, 7.3% were African
American and 6.6% were Asian American.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson's first-term appointees were similar: 28.4% women, 9%
Latino, 6.1% African American, and 4.2% of Asian decent. One
difference is that Wilson was more partisan; 90% of his appointees
were Republicans and 80% of Davis' appointees are Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Yamaki counters that the Senate figures ignore large numbers of
appointees who required no confirmation.</TE>
<TE>   His statistics include posts that require Senate confirmation,
plus Cabinet jobs, judgeships, many professional boards and others,
including nearly 500 county fair board members.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's numbers show that Davis' full list of
appointees is 40% women, 7.4% Asian Americans, 7.3% African
Americans, and 10.9% Latinos. Wilson, according to the Davis
administration, appointed 38% women, 4.7% Asian Americans, 4.8%
African Americans and 6.3% Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll go toe to toe with anybody on this," Yamaki said. "We've got
the diversity.... I can't go back to L.A., I can't go back to my
community, if we don't."</TE>

<LD>Federal officials are investigating how 28 nuclear power plant
workers were exposed to radiation during a maintenance operation.</LD>
<LD>   Florida Power &amp; Light, owner of the St. Lucie Nuclear Plant, said
plant employees and several outside contractors inhaled radioactive

units.</LD>
<LD>   The radiation was at a "very low" level, and none of the workers
reported feeling sick, the company said.</LD>

<HD>Agency Lost Contact on 3,000 Kids, It Says</HD>
<DH>Florida officials say some of those children had run away,
others lived with relatives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The state's child welfare agency says it was unable to contact more
than 3,000 children in its care last month, the most since April,
when its failure to keep track of a missing Miami girl was revealed.</LD>
<LD>   Department of Children &amp; Families caseworkers are required to make
monthly visits to all 48,537 children under state care. In September,
the department did not visit 3,185 children, up from 2,820 in August
and 1,602 in July.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the children ran away, others lived with relatives out of
state or were away on vacation, but 1,786 of the children unaccounted
for did not fall under those categories. The DCF said many of them
weren't home when caseworkers arrived.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't know if they're alive or lost or how many are at risk of
other kinds of injuries," said David Bazerman, an attorney who
represents foster children for Legal Aid Services of Broward County.
"We don't know what's going on with them. That's not acceptable."</TE>
<TE>   Of the 3,185 children the DCF failed to contact, 921 were living
outside Florida with court permission and had no visit from a
caseworker in the second state.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 2,264 children living in Florida did not receive a
visit from a DCF caseworker, including 299 runaways and 111 children
who left their assigned placement with parents or relatives without
notifying the state, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Jeb Bush ordered the monthly visits in April after 6-year-old
Rilya Wilson of Miami was reported missing. Rilya's disappearance 15
months earlier went unnoticed by DCF workers who skipped the required
monthly visits with the girl for more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   The department still hadn't contacted 1,237 children by the May 31
deadline.</TE>
<TE>   "How many months has it been since those 1,786 children haven't
been seen?" asked Carolyn Salisbury, associate director of the
University of Miami's Children and Youth Law Clinic. "How many more
Rilya Wilsons may be out there?"</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the DCF announced its previously reported total
population of children was too low and did not include "runaways,
absconded children, children placed in other states, children in
long-term licensed custody, and children placed with families that
are traveling, refusing contact with the department or have moved."</TE>

<HD>Constant Vigilance Is Watchword Around Capital</HD>
<DH>The hamlets of Virginia and Maryland were seen as havens,
but a sniper has changed all that. 'I keep looking behind my back,'
one man says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Megan K. Stack and Chuck Neubauer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>FREDERICKSBURG, Va.</DL>
<LD>It was a leafy fall day, a lazy collection of suburban vignettes just
slightly askew.</LD>
<LD>   There were dusty pumpkins in the wood chips of the town square --
but no children ventured forth. Playing fields stretched brilliant
under a low sky -- but no cleats pounded the grass. Shadows gathered
on the greening stones of the Confederate Cemetery -- but no
sightseers wandered among the graves. With a killer on the loose, the
vast swaths of towns and fields that spill out from the nation's
capital stood unnaturally quiet Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "People are scared to come out the house," said farmer Albert
Pitts, who displayed a harvest of cucumbers, melons and string beans
to a few shoppers in this old brick town. "I'm halfway scared just
standing here. I keep looking behind my back."</LD>
<TE>   He pointed toward a distant treetop.</TE>
<TE>   "You see that? He could be right up in there and we'd never know
it. He could kill us standing here." Pitts frowned into the ground.
"I don't feel safe at all."</TE>
<TE>   With no discernible motive, with nothing but a handful of bullets
and a daunting cloak of invisibility, an anonymous gunman has managed
to send slivers of terror through a sprawling community of 5 million
people. Fear has settled over the old killing grounds of the Civil
War battlefields. Tension laces the crannies of rundown urban
outskirts. Men, women and children have been stalked at filling
stations, strip malls and a schoolyard. The killer has struck time
after time, only to slip through the grasp of the law. And it's
anybody's guess where the bullets will strike next.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, I'm standing in line at the supermarket, and I left my
13-year-old out in the car," Sue Schumann said. "And all of a sudden
it dawned on me how stupid that was. Why did I leave my daughter in
the car?"</TE>
<TE>   The fear began like a pinprick on a remote corner of the map, far
from the rolling forests of northern Virginia. When the sniper
rampaged through Montgomery County, Md., with his rifle, felling six
people in two days, the threat was vague -- a distant menace;
somebody else's problem.</TE>
<TE>   The sense of security was quick to melt. The shooting deaths have
been sprinkled in an erratic pattern around Washington. The roving
sniper shoots, and having shot, moves on. If the goal is widespread
terror, the tactic is flawless.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just tragic," said Fairfax police officer David Sharp, "how
this guy is affecting the area."</TE>
<TE>   In the traditional order of things, the streets of Washington are
supposed to be the dicey, seamy and sometimes murderous venues. The
sleepy hamlets of Virginia and Maryland flourished because they
promised wooded deliverance from intercity perils. When darkness
fell, workers hopped onto the Metro and slipped across the Potomac or
up Massachusetts Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   The sniper has managed to turn Washington inside out. The deaths
have formed a ring around the city, rattling nerves by trespassing an
imaginary sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a bedroom community -- it is no stranger to violent crime
but it is not frequent," Vienna police Lt. Mike Miller said. "No one
likes to feel threatened anytime they step out on their porch just
because they step outside."</TE>
<TE>   The killer has roamed deep into Virginia, breaching the
Rappahannock River where Interstate 95 plunges into the South and
following I-66 to Manassas, where the extended dormitories of
Washington are pushing west in a flurry of construction. Near the
glades where people shoot deer, rabbit and squirrel, somebody has
turned neighborhoods into hunting grounds and put people in the cross
hairs.</TE>
<TE>   Along the wall of the Stafford sheriff's office, a jumble of
pamphlets tells the tale of a tranquil county. McGruff the Crime
Dog's safety quiz. Warnings against reckless driving, and driving
drunk. Safety tips for river recreation.</TE>
<TE>   In dozens of speed-trap towns and crime-free hamlets, men and
women who cut their teeth on dope busts, drunk drivers and house
robberies wait in heady anxiety for the sniper's next move.</TE>
<TE>   They know the risk: To capture one of modern history's most
perplexing serial killers would be the pinnacle of any career -- but
if the killer evades detection again, the chagrin will be profound.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a double-edged sword," said Lt. Bryant Halstead of the
Stafford County sheriff's office. "I don't want him to come here. On
the other hand, I'd like the opportunity to apprehend him."</TE>
<TE>   A short stroll from car door to shop entrance has become an
exercise in willpower -- and in geometry. Shoppers peer around,
looking for hills or trees that could conceal a sniper. Gas station
attendants arrange hulking trucks to shield their pumps from passing
traffic. Jogging trails through the woods are nearly empty.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel a sense of vulnerability that I usually don't have," apple
farmer Kathy Reid said. "It's sad."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, day-care provider Joyce Gabriel and her
11-year-old daughter stopped at a convenience store. When the girl
dawdled in the parking lot, anxiety washed over Gabriel. "Get in, go
on, hurry up!" she snapped at her perplexed daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't tell her why," she said later. "She has enough to worry
about."</TE>
<TE>   But sooner or later, the tank runs dry. Gabriel has been plotting
her next gas station stop. "I think I've got it figured out," she
said Saturday. "My theory is to go someplace that's not near any
major highways. It's got to be near side roads."</TE>
<TE>   One of the strongest clues authorities have is the sighting of a
white truck near some of the crime scenes. The trouble is, Greater
Washington seems to brim with white vans and trucks. "Every time you
turn your head you see a white van," said Vienna Fire Chief Don
Burns.</TE>
<TE>   Therein lies the rub of mystery: As long as the killer is nobody,
it could be anybody. "I could have walked into Wawa [convenience
store] this morning and said hello to him," Halstead said.</TE>
<TE>   And so they struggle to keep their heads down, and wait for the
roving sniper to strike again.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know who it is," said Sandra Culliton, "but it's bad."</TE>
<TE>   It's been more than a week since a woman was shot loading packages
into her car outside a nearby crafts store. After the attack,
Culliton moved through the corridors of the Fredericksburg retirement
home where she works, and cloaked every window with a bedsheet.
Cotton is a flimsy defense, she said with a shrug, but at least it
blots out the view.</TE>
<TE>   The makeshift curtains were just the beginning -- as long as the
killer is loose, the elderly residents will be forbidden to walk on
the front lawns.</TE>
<TE>   "We try so hard not to make a big deal of it, because we don't
want to scare them," Culliton said, and shook her head. "We try to
make it seem like a fun game."</TE>

<HD>Thousands Pack Tribute to Firefighters</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Thousands of firefighters from around the world packed Madison Square
Garden and the surrounding streets Saturday for a solemn memorial
ceremony to honor 356 New York City firefighters killed in the line
of duty -- 343 of them at the World Trade Center last year.</LD>
<LD>   Many in the audience of 25,000 inside and 30,000 watching on TV
screens outside the arena cried quietly as pictures of the
firefighters smiled from the screens, some shown in crisp formal
uniforms, others in wedding tuxedos and many holding children.</LD>
<LD>   "They went beyond professionalism, and carried with them the
strength and courage that remind the nation of the gallant heroes of
our past," Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said. "Even though they are no
longer among us, they continue to lead."</LD>
<TE>   Former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani reminded the audience that,
despite the great sadness surrounding the day, those who were lost
would not want their families and friends to dwell on their grieving.</TE>
<TE>   "They died to protect people, they died to protect life ... and I
think they would want you, the people that they loved, to move
forward, to be brave," he said. "Our mourning will live until we die,
their heroism will live forever."</TE>
<TE>   As the final name was read in a roll call of those being honored,
the arena erupted into a five-minute standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   "I lost a lot of friends, and it's a year, but the hurt doesn't go
away," Brooklyn firefighter Todd Bilgore said. "It keeps hurting."</TE>
<TE>   The memorial began with thousands of firefighters -- led by color
guards, bagpipers and drummers from the New York Fire Department --
marching in heavy rain up Eighth Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the procession, 356 firefighters, some from as far away as
Japan and Australia, each carried a U.S. flag representing an FDNY
member lost in the line of duty since October 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The deaths over the last two years include the twin towers victims
and nine paramedics and firefighters killed in other incidents, three
retirees working as World Trade Center fire safety directors and a
member of the insurance industry-funded New York Fire Patrol.</TE>
<TE>   Each victim's family was to be presented with the Medal of Supreme
Sacrifice.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like the city's officially closing the book on it," said
Chief John O'Rourke, a 37-year department veteran. "The fire
department will never close the book on it."</TE>
<TE>   The department's annual ceremony for firefighters lost in the line
of duty was moved to Madison Square Garden this year to accommodate
families and friends.</TE>

<HD>Las Vegas Mayor Gins Up Support</HD>
<DH>Oscar Goodman decides to promote a liquor firm in exchange
for a charitable donation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tom Gorman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>He is the mayor, after all, who invites residents to meet him for a
drink at a local bar to discuss civic issues. "Martinis With the
Mayor," the sessions are called. And they've become so popular, bars
clamor to host the next one.</LD>
<LD>   And gin martinis have been Oscar Goodman's companion for 38 years,
which has helped endear him with constituents as a regular fellow who
lives life with gusto.</LD>
<LD>   All this is to say that, in Vegas, the mayor and martinis go
together like Siegfried and Roy.</LD>
<TE>   So when Goodman agreed to switch from his favorite gin to a brand
sold by the state's largest liquor distributor in exchange for
$100,000 (donated to charity, of course), there was barely a stir
(which is not how he prefers his drink).</TE>
<TE>   "Have times and morals changed so drastically that it is
acceptable for the mayor of a city to accept monetary compensation
for publicly encouraging drinking?" one woman wrote in a letter to
the editor of the Las Vegas Review-Journal.</TE>
<TE>   Goodman, who encourages only responsible drinking and
designated-driver programs, has never let convention stand in the way
of promotion.</TE>
<TE>   The Democrat once urged the city to endorse an Internet gambling
Web site in exchange for a piece of the action. The idea was
withdrawn on a technicality: Internet gambling is banned by federal
law. Elected mayor in 1999 largely on his popularity as a defense
attorney for mobsters, he wants to convert an old downtown post
office into a mob museum.</TE>
<TE>   So Friday night, when Goodman accepted the $100,000 check at a
downtown street party attended by several thousand revelers, showroom
entertainers sang and showgirls swished, their towering feather
headdresses swaying back and forth.</TE>
<TE>   Goodman danced with "cuchi-cuchi" performer Charo, posed with a
Playboy playmate starring in a new Strip strip show and was serenaded
by Dean Martin and Marilyn Monroe impersonators.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, everything was so Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   All the while, Goodman sipped a martini or three from an oversize
glass and told everyone -- surely without exaggerating -- that he's
the happiest mayor in the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Isn't this the greatest thing in the world?" Goodman gushed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the only place in the world that can have a party like
this," he shouted to the crowd. "In all the other cities, people just
mope around."</TE>
<TE>   The gin endorsement was part gimmick, part fund-raiser for the
mayor, in cahoots with Southern Nevada Wine and Spirits.</TE>
<TE>   The company is philanthropically active in Las Vegas and its
managing director, Larry Ruvo, asked Goodman if he would switch from
his favorite brand of gin -- Beefeater, which is distributed by a
competing company -- in favor of "any other one he wanted -- as long
as we distributed it."</TE>
<TE>   Goodman agreed, and in exchange, he received $100,000. Rather than
apply the money toward his bar bill, Goodman split it between two
charitable causes -- to help the homeless, and for scholarships at a
private school co-founded by his wife of 40 years, Carolyn.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had dog shows and other sorts of fund-raisers, but this one
takes the cake," she said at Friday's night VIP gin party, which City
Hall billed as the world's largest happy hour.</TE>
<TE>   After some due-diligence taste testing, Goodman chose Bombay
Sapphire.</TE>
<TE>   Now, T-shirts, napkins, stirrers, glasses and other promotional
items will be distributed in bars all around town pushing the Oscar
Martini -- Bombay Sapphire gin and dry vermouth, shaken and straight
up with three anchovy-stuffed olives.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange, participating bars must agree to kick in a portion of
the Oscar Martini proceeds to the homeless fund.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's martini marquee has drawn some cynical reactions. Las
Vegas Sun columnist Jeff German wondered whether his next promotion
would be renaming City Hall "Heineken Hall," and activists against
drunken driving voiced concern about mixed messages. But overall,
locals seem to have embraced the popular mayor's promotional antics,
and the few voices of displeasure were drowned out by the crowds
Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   "Only Oscar could pull this off," says District Court Judge Kathy
Hardcastle, watching the events with some amazement.</TE>
<TE>   George Schick, who mixes paint at the local Home Depot, drank beer
from a large, plastic football-shaped container and gave his mayor an
"attaboy."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm Republican, but I still like Oscar," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of what he does may seem a little far out there, but at
least he's trying, and he's perpetuating our image, that Vegas is a
place to have fun."</TE>

<HD>In Minnesota, It May Be a Hard Sell for an Independent</HD>
<DH>Post-Jesse Ventura, Tim Penny must show voters a
third-party governor can get things done.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephanie Simon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MILACA, Minn. -- The candidate is strolling through the senior
citizens center, looking to shake some hands. But the white-haired
men and women bent over their quarters are playing cards too intently
to pay him much heed.</LD>
<LD>   Then Don Murray bounds up -- 80 years old and flamboyantly
exuberant.</LD>
<LD>   "Hey!" he booms, clapping the candidate on the back. "So you're
Jesse's buddy, eh?"</LD>
<TE>   Tim Penny's meet-and-greet smile tightens. "Well," he says, "I am
the independent candidate for governor."</TE>
<TE>   In Minnesota these days, that is a delicate position indeed. Penny
is running to succeed Gov. Jesse Ventura, the ex-wrestler-in-pink-boa
who has specialized in promoting his outrageous persona, to the
embarrassment of many constituents.</TE>
<TE>   As an advisor -- and yes, friend -- to the governor, Penny hopes
to capitalize on Ventura's reputation for blunt talk, decisive action
and devil-may-care independence. Yet he also has to prove that a
third-party governor can get things done.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura was elected -- on the Reform Party ticket, although he
later defected to the Independence Party -- in part because voters
delighted in his disdain for partisan politics. They found out,
however, that a governor who gleefully body-slammed both parties
could barely advance his agenda.</TE>
<TE>   So, in an odd twist, this year's Independence candidate is
campaigning as the ultimate insider.</TE>
<TE>   Penny served 12 years in the U.S. House of Representatives before
resigning in 1994 with a scathing denunciation of Washington
politics. This time around, he reminds voters at every stop that he
and his running mate, state Sen. Martha Robertson, are seasoned
politicians: he a former Democrat, she an ex-Republican.</TE>
<TE>   Penny, 50, positions himself as the "sensible center," above the
partisan fray. He travels the state in the "Common Cents Express," a
low-rent orange-and-black minibus with a cracked windshield and
seriously deficient shock absorbers. He boasts that his campaign is
cheap by necessity (he won't take political action committee money)
and old-fashioned out of principle (he refuses to hire pollsters).</TE>
<TE>   But although he has all the trappings of an upstart outsider,
Penny never stops pushing the message that he and Robertson know how
to work the system. As he puts it: "We know the players. We know the
programs. And we can get things done."</TE>
<TE>   His opponents say that's bunk. No matter how experienced, a
third-party governor will have trouble corralling legislators to back
him on difficult decisions, they argue. And with the state facing a
$2-billion budget deficit, difficult decisions await.</TE>
<TE>   "A third-party governor is a failed experiment. It was fun and
entertaining when everyone had money and jobs," said state Sen. Roger
Moe, 58, the Democratic candidate. "But when times got tough, when
[Ventura] had to govern, when he had to build coalitions, he failed."</TE>
<TE>   State Rep. Tim Pawlenty, 41, the GOP candidate, echoes that.
Spokesman Peter Hong said: "We've had the ultimate case of
tri-partisan gridlock. It's time for Minnesota to get out of neutral
and pick a direction."</TE>
<TE>   "The people who pushed Jesse so much said he'd be a good
go-between with the two parties in the Legislature. But he treated
the legislators like clowns," Princeton Mayor Brian Humphrey said.
"He wasn't an honest broker."</TE>
<TE>   Humphrey is leaning toward supporting Pawlenty. "I guess I'm a
party person," he said, sounding almost regretful that he could not
in good conscience call himself an independent.</TE>
<TE>   But across the state, even the most zealous "party people" are
beginning to take Penny's campaign seriously. Polls show him running
roughly even with Moe and Pawlenty; the race is, at this point, a
three-way tie. And though just 8% of Minnesota voters identify
themselves as independent, 57% believe the state is "better off" with
"more than two strong political parties," according to a recent poll
by the Minneapolis Star Tribune newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   John Brandl, for instance, is a lifelong Democrat, yet the former
state legislator plans to vote for Penny. "I know all three
candidates and they're all responsible, good people," he said. "But
the hold that special interest groups have on politicians is a major
problem, and Penny has a chance to break the mold."</TE>
<TE>   A large part of Penny's appeal is that he's no Ventura: Earnest
and intense, he listens more than he talks.</TE>
<TE>   On the campaign trail, Penny can happily spend an hour discussing
arcane finance issues with a small-town mayor -- leaving himself just
three minutes to meet potential voters on Main Street. When he
addresses groups, his shoulders hunch and his voice tends to trail
into a mumble.</TE>
<TE>   That's a major plus to voters like Kristan Dye, who directs the
Chamber of Commerce in the rural town of Mora. "As long as he doesn't
stick his foot in his mouth and doesn't wear a boa, we're fine with
the idea of a third-party governor," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Penny has asked Ventura to join him in a few appearances. And he
gladly accepted the governor's leftover campaign funds. Mostly,
though, he's going it alone. His chief message is fiscal
responsibility -- and it's a sobering one.</TE>
<TE>   Pawlenty, the Republican, has vowed not to raise taxes if elected.
He tells voters he can take care of the budget deficit by cutting
government waste. And he promises that he will spend amply when
spending is warranted; for example, he wants to fund $3 billion in
road repairs through bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Moe, the Democrat, has said he's open to some tax increases,
especially on gasoline and cigarettes. Yet he also promises new
programs, such as paid time off for parents of newborns and an "early
education cabinet" to focus on preschools. "Somehow, some way, we'll
make it work," he says, projecting confidence.</TE>
<TE>   Penny, in contrast, goes out of his way to advise voters that the
state has, as he puts it, a "big mess" to deal with -- and that the
cleanup may not be pretty. He says tax hikes and service cuts are
inevitable. He tells college students he may have to raise tuition.
He warns mayors that state aid to municipalities may be slashed. His
mantra: "Everything's on the table."</TE>
<TE>   That's OK by Don Murray. As he guides Penny to his table at the
Senior Center in Milaca, about an hour's drive north of the Twin
Cities, he does not press for rosy promises.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Penny is the candidate of the Independence Party, and that's
good enough for him.</TE>
<TE>   "I voted for Jesse and I'm going to vote for this dude too,"
Murray said. "We've got Republicans and we've got Democrats, and we
need someone to hold 'em both in check."</TE>

<DH>Attack ads in the contest for a new House seat irk voters.
With control of the chamber on the line, each candidate expects to
spend $3 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tom Gorman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>LAS VEGAS -- One of the nation's few competitive House races has
evolved here also into one of the nastiest and most expensive.</LD>
<LD>   State legislators drew the new 3rd Congressional District with
roughly an equal number of Democrats and Republicans. Now Clark
County Commissioner Dario Herrera -- the Democrat -- and former state
Sen. Jon Porter -- the Republican -- find themselves locked in a much
bigger battle for control of the House.</LD>
<LD>   Each side expects to spend at least $3 million on the race, which
has forced Herrera to defend himself against ethics questions and
Porter to answer accusations that he would put Social Security funds
at risk.</LD>
<TE>   With three weeks still remaining, many voters have had enough.</TE>
<TE>   "You're attacking him, he's attacking you," George Saffeels
complained to Porter, as the 47-year-old Republican campaigned
recently at a weekend art fair. "I don't know who to believe."</TE>
<TE>   Answered Porter: "I'm trying to discuss the issues, but the
problem with political ads is, you don't have to tell the truth.
There aren't any laws."</TE>
<TE>   Knocking on doors three miles away, Herrera heard much the same
thing from another frustrated voter, Robert Henderson.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that another politician will spend his time beating up
someone over such a piddly amount of money, that's just wrong,"
Henderson said, referring to a controversy over Herrera's acceptance
of a $42,000 no-bid contract to do consulting work for the Las Vegas
Housing Authority.</TE>
<TE>   "They're making political issues where they don't exist," Herrera
later said. "My only regret is that my opponent continues to
personally and viciously attack me on issues that aren't important to
Nevada families."</TE>
<TE>   Herrera, 29, the son of Cuban immigrants, moved here from Miami to
attend college on a football scholarship, and became smitten with
politics. At 23, he was elected to the state Assembly; at 25, to the
Clark County commission. He has yet to lose an election and is
embraced by Democrats as a potential role model in party efforts to
court Latino voters.</TE>
<TE>   He has since been pummeled for taking the housing agency's public
relations job. Herrera denies any wrongdoing. Republicans also say
Herrera did not do enough as a county commissioner to rein in the
region's rising energy costs -- no small matter given Nevada's
blast-furnace summers.</TE>
<TE>   Porter, who trains insurance agents, served as a city councilman
and mayor of Boulder City. In 2000, he ended his six-year state
Senate tenure and ran unsuccessfully for Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats have attacked him as an insurance industry pawn who
doesn't hold the interests of senior citizens at heart. They also
link Porter with the Bush administration's support of Yucca Mountain
as the nation's depository for highly radioactive nuclear waste.</TE>
<TE>   In TV ads that pointedly feature the logo of the collapsed Enron
Corp., Herrera also suggests Porter supports the privatization of
Social Security and investing retirement funds in the volatile stock
market. Porter says he has never supported privatization and opposes
Social Security investments in Wall Street, although he entertained
the notion two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Nevada is a state where neither major party enjoys a significant
advantage. It has a Democrat and Republican in each of its two Senate
and two House seats. In the 2000 presidential election, Nevada
slightly favored Republican candidate George W. Bush, but
metropolitan Clark County -- which includes Las Vegas -- voted for
Democrat Al Gore.</TE>
<TE>   Nevada gained a seat in the House as a result of the state's
explosive, gambling-driven growth over the last decade. State
legislators drew the new district's boundaries within burgeoning
Clark County -- including parts of Las Vegas as well as Henderson,
Boulder City and Laughlin -- to protect the Republican and Democrat
incumbents in the state's other two congressional districts. The most
recent registration figures show 2,200 more Republican voters in the
new district than Democrats. Independents, who represent 14% of the
registration, may swing the election.</TE>
<TE>   "This campaign is a mud bath, with Porter being made out as the
big, bad insurance executive and Herrera facing his own ethics
problems," said Amy Walter, an analyst with the nonpartisan Cook
Political Report. "Before the ethics stuff came out, Herrera was the
Democrats' 'golden boy' -- young, charismatic, attractive.... The
Democrats would love to take him around the country to help recruit
Hispanic candidates and promote their agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing wrong with Porter," Walter said, "just a
blandness that he embraces in a world of uncertainty."</TE>
<TE>   At the art fair, Porter shakes more hands; an aide tags along,
handing out campaign brochures. In a neighborhood a few miles away,
Herrera knocks on more doors. "We're going to need you!" he tells
everyone he sees.</TE>

<HD>Hear Ye, Hear Ye! N.Y. Tones Down</HD>
<DH>City's noise crackdown is to improve quality of life,
officials say. Experts link din to hearing loss, learning difficulty
in children.</DH>

<AU>Robert Lee Hotz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Even a downpour could not dampen the din Friday night along Bleecker
Street in Greenwich Village, a block singled out by city sound
enforcement officers as one of the noisiest in this cacophony
capital.</LD>
<LD>   The storied street of bars and blues and boozy midnights was alive
with shrieks as umbrellas blossomed in front of the Bitter End, the
Peculiar Pub and other haunts that, for tourists, make this block a
synonym for a raucous good time and, for neighborhood activists, a
never-ending source of noise complaints.</LD>
<LD>   "You want quiet? Go to Brooklyn," said Reynaldo Gayle, a genial
bouncer wearing a "Don't Judge Me" T-shirt in front of the Asylum.
"This is the strip where people come to make the noise."</LD>
<TE>   An impatient taxi driver, hemmed in by a white stretch limousine
and a throng of distracted barhoppers, honked his horn a little too
enthusiastically in the post-midnight hours. Three New York policemen
swooped out from under a nearby awning and surrounded the hapless
driver.</TE>
<TE>   Busted.</TE>
<TE>   The driver was caught up in Operation Silent Night, New York Mayor
Michael R. Bloomberg's war on barking dogs, blaring stereos,
unmuffled motorcycles and the bleary bellow of tourists who are
loving New York too loudly. To crack down on noise pollution,
Bloomberg this month targeted 24 neighborhoods for stepped-up
enforcement of noise ordinances. He also ordered the city's
antiquated noise laws strengthened.</TE>
<TE>   Noise has become one of America's top neighborhood complaints,
from protests about the roar of snowmobiles in the wilderness of
Yellowstone National Park to well-mannered spats about weed whackers
in San Marino. Several experts say noise in urban areas has grown
sixfold in the last 15 years. There are more planes overhead, more
helicopters, more cars honking, more trucks grinding gears, more
beepers, more ringers, more buzzers and bells. In New York,
complaints are running well ahead of last year, totaling 93,000 so
far.</TE>
<TE>   City officials launched the noise crackdown to improve New York's
quality of life, but health officials point out that all the noise is
doing more than keeping residents awake in the city that never
sleeps.</TE>
<TE>   "Noise is not just an annoyance; it is a health hazard," said
psychologist Arline Bonzaft, a member of the New York Council on the
Environment.</TE>
<TE>   New research has found that noise poses a collection of health
consequences beyond hearing damage: elevated blood pressure;
increased risk of heart attacks; increased levels of destructive
stress hormones; skewed mental abilities and mood; dulled long-term
memory; impaired speech perception; and shortened attention spans.
Women are less able to ignore unwanted noise than men, researchers at
Texas A&amp;M University have found.</TE>
<TE>   And children may face lifelong problems from exposure to even
low-level noise, researchers at Cornell University have discovered in
the first study of its kind.</TE>
<TE>   Excessive noise seriously interferes with children's ability to
learn, a Cornell environmental psychologist and his colleagues
recently concluded after studying children living near European
airports. Relatively low levels of noise, including traffic, were
enough to damage reading abilities and memory, as well as raise blood
pressure and stress hormones in children.</TE>
<TE>   "Noise exposure is consistently linked to reading deficits and may
interfere with speech perception and long-term memory in primary
school children," said Cornell's Gary Evans, whose most recent
findings were published by the American Psychological Assn. in the
September issue of Psychological Science.</TE>
<TE>   "The typical public health response to noise is to see if it
damages hearing, but that is only the tip of the iceberg," Evans
said.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the hearing damage caused by too much noise also appears
to be worsening every year, according to research by the New
York-based League for the Hard of Hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The group, which has screened 100,000 people over the last 19
years, found that more people failed the hearing tests every year in
every age group. Increasing noise pollution may be the cause, the
organization believes.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, almost all of the hearing problems so common among the
elderly may be nothing more than a lifetime effect of too much noise,
research suggests. Studies of people living in less industrialized,
more bucolic conditions show that hearing loss among the elderly is
virtually nonexistent.</TE>
<TE>   "Much of what we think of as hearing damage due to natural aging
is not," said Nancy Nadler, director of New York's Noise Center. "It
is the lifetime exposure to noise. It all adds up over time."</TE>
<TE>   Growing worries about the health effects of too much noise are
turning America into a nation of sound-deadening windows, highway
sound walls, office acoustic baffles, white noise machines and
noise-canceling headphones.</TE>
<TE>   To find peace and quiet, people fight noise with noise. They don
stereo headphones, turn up the television or crank up the car stereo.
In the same spirit, acoustic designers turn up the music to create a
mood or to muffle street noise. People stand on the sidewalk to shout
on cell phones because they can't hear indoors. Construction racket
and traffic rumble drown out their conversations.</TE>
<TE>   "People are inundated with sound," said Bonzaft. "The world has
gotten noisier."</TE>
<TE>   By attacking neighborhood noise, New York officials say they are
trying to darn the fraying fabric of urban civility. "Noise
complaints in New York City are increasingly an indicator of a lack
of civility and urban disorder," said Christopher O. Ward,
commissioner of the city Department of Environmental Protection.</TE>
<TE>   In less than two weeks, police have issued 159 summonses for noise
violations, which can bring fines up to $25,000 for the most serious
repeat offenders.</TE>
<TE>   But for some people, noise does have its proper place.</TE>
<TE>   Bleecker Street may be one of them.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a loud block, no question," said Paul Rizzo, collecting
the cover charge under the blue canopy of the Bitter End, which as
New York City's oldest rock club has been making local noise since
1961.</TE>
<TE>   There were six live bands on the show list Friday night and four
policemen across the street keeping an ear to the noise levels. A
precinct police captain already had asked Rizzo once to quiet down.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as noise goes, this is Greenwich Village," Rizzo said,
"not Greenwich, Connecticut."</TE>

<HD>Americans Fear Sniper More Than Terrorists, Poll Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Americans are more worried about snipers like the killer stalking the
Washington area than about terrorists, according to a Newsweek poll
released Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Forty-seven percent of those polled said they were either very or
somewhat concerned that someone in their family might become a victim
of a sniper attack. That compared with 43% who said they were
somewhat or very concerned about family members falling victim to a
terrorist strike.</LD>
<LD>   The poll was published as police said the elusive "Beltway sniper"
had struck again, bringing his toll to eight dead and two wounded in
the Washington area. Women and minorities were more fearful of sniper
attacks than men or respondents identified as white. About 56% of
women polled said they were somewhat or very concerned, compared with
38% of men surveyed.</LD>
<TE>   Of the minorities responding to the poll, 58% said that they were
somewhat or very concerned, compared with 44% of the whites of both
sexes polled.</TE>
<TE>   The poll of 1,000 adults age 18 and older for Newsweek by
Princeton Survey Research Associates had a margin of error of plus or
minus 3 percentage points.</TE>

<HD>Spacewalkers Take Saturday to Do Their Outdoor Chores</HD>
<DH>Astronauts check out the plumbing, install clamps during
foray outside space station.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Two spacewalking astronauts worked on the outdoor plumbing of the
international space station Saturday, hooking up new air-conditioning
lines and installing clamps to prevent pressure buildups.</LD>
<LD>   It was the second spacewalk in three days for David Wolf and Piers
Sellers, visiting from space shuttle Atlantis.</LD>
<LD>   The men immediately encountered stiff joints in some of the space
station's older pipes, which contained ammonia coolant. What's more,
the areas were hard to reach.</LD>
<TE>   With his long arms, Sellers managed to pry open the joints ever so
slightly and install the specially designed, pressure-relief clamps.</TE>
<TE>   "It is quite possible you're the only person in the astronaut
office who could have done that task," Pamela Melroy said from inside
the orbiting complex.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the second-longest armed," Sellers replied. "The other guy,
we know about him. He's a primate for sure."</TE>
<TE>   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration designed the
clamps after ground testing uncovered a potential pressure problem in
the ammonia lines of the new $390-million girder, which was delivered
last week by Atlantis. Older equipment, already in orbit, also was
found to have vulnerable joints.</TE>
<TE>   Engineers feared that if ammonia leaked into the joints and
pressure built up, the pipes might not twist apart if a component
needed to be replaced in the future. So clamps were built to prevent
increased pressure -- and it was up to Wolf and Sellers to install
almost 30 of them Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   As expected, pressure had already built up in some of the older
lines.</TE>
<TE>   Wolf successfully snapped on his first clamp, after relieving the
pressure. "I felt it burp," he said. Sellers had more trouble. "I
need another third hand, really," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mission Control was "flabbergasted" when Wolf discovered some
missing pieces in the older plumbing.</TE>
<TE>   Altogether, 100 clamps will need to be installed, with the job
spread over three shuttle visits.</TE>
<TE>   Besides making those repairs, Wolf and Sellers connected
cooling-system lines for the new 14-ton girder, which has three
radiators and two ammonia tanks.</TE>
<TE>   They also released the brakes on the railcar that came up on the
girder, along with a set of tracks.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, the space station's robot arm worked fine as a work
platform. The crane malfunctioned during Thursday's excursion, and
the astronauts had to lug and plug in a TV camera by hand.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Wolf noticed a sheared bolt on the camera assembly.</TE>
<TE>   A second camera went on much more easily Saturday, although it
caused some shaking that was felt deep inside the space station's
lab.</TE>
<TE>   The spacewalkers wrapped up work early this time, spending six
hours out in the vacuum and earning, from Melroy, the title of "speed
demons."</TE>
<TE>   Wolf and Sellers will take one last spacewalk on Monday.</TE>

<LD>Kenneth H. Bridges saw his job as a calling, and it kept him on the
road a lot -- sometimes more than his family wanted.</LD>
<LD>   Bridges, 53, was the entrepreneur who co-founded Matah Network, a
distribution network designed to strengthen African Americans by
getting them to buy products from black manufacturers. Friends called
him charismatic, and neighbors said he was one of the kindest people
they knew.</LD>
<LD>   A former Amway distributor, Bridges attended the Wharton School of
Business in Philadelphia. Five years ago, he founded the Matah
Network.</LD>
<TE>   He was an advocate of government reparations to black Americans.
He believed that by buying products built by other African Americans,
blacks were giving themselves "internal reparations."</TE>
<TE>   He lived with his wife and six children in the Philadelphia
neighborhood of Germantown. Bridges was in Virginia on Friday for a
meeting with officials of Dudley Products, which makes cosmetics and
personal care products.</TE>
<TE>   At 9:30 a.m. Bridges was shot and killed by the sniper as he
pumped gas in Fredericksburg, only moments after he had talked to his
wife by phone.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Matah's Web site was flooded with messages of sadness
and sympathy.</TE>
<TE>   "I am still in shock. He was truly an African warrior," wrote
Doris Oluremi Person.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   James L. "Sonny" Buchanan Jr. was the son of a police officer and
he inherited some of a policeman's sense of community service. The
39-year-old Buchanan had long been active in the area's Boys and
Girls Club, had mentored young people, and had worked with a Crime
Solvers hotline.</TE>
<TE>   Friends knew the landscaper for his many personal kindnesses. He
was forever dropping off gifts, they said, teaching young people how
to grow plants and offering encouragement. George Jones III, 21, whom
Buchanan worked with in the Boys and Girls Club, recalled at
Buchanan's funeral how Buchanan had "never tried to be a father
figure. He was always just a friend."</TE>
<TE>   Buchanan had roots in Washington's Maryland suburbs, where he had
gone to high school and the University of Maryland before opening a
successful landscaping business. This year, he sold that business to
help his father build a dream house in rural Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   He believed in keeping commitments, and he had come back to
Maryland to cut the grass of a former customer when he was killed.
His father, James Buchanan Sr., had taught his son that those less
well-off always deserved help. "He literally took that to heart,"
Buchanan said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Premkumar A. Walekar left India for the United States at age 18,
looking for a better life. He never accepted all the ways of his
adopted land, and he planned to move back soon to a house he had
purchased in India.</TE>
<TE>   A soft-spoken man, Walekar, 54, attended Montgomery College, a
large community college that has been a first step for tens of
thousands of immigrants moving to the Washington area. Walekar got a
job working for a magazine distributor and held a second job as a
steakhouse cook.</TE>
<TE>   He allowed his mother to arrange a marriage for him to an Indian
woman named Margaret. He fell in love with her when he saw her
picture, he told friends; they were married two days after they met.</TE>
<TE>   Premkumar and Margaret moved to the outer suburb of Olney, Md.,
where they had two children, Andrew, 23, and Andrea, 24. They were
his joy. After he retired from the magazine business, Walekar began
driving a cab. He had recently begun trying to arrange his daughter's
marriage, and as soon as he finished that task, he planned to move
with his wife back to India.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he was shot and killed as he pumped gas into his cab in
Rockville, Md., last week. "Those cruel hands ended his life like a
snap," his brother-in-law, Lazarus Borge, said at his funeral.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Ramos, 34, had finished one year of law school in El
Salvador when she emigrated to the United States with her husband,
Carlos. The move meant that her husband, a professor who speaks
little English, would be at least temporarily unemployed, and that
her earnings as a nanny and housecleaner would support the family.</TE>
<TE>   Ramos and her husband hoped for a better life in the Maryland
suburbs. And they hoped for a good education for their son, Carlos
Jr., 7, who attends elementary school in Silver Spring, Md.</TE>
<TE>   A deeply religious woman, Ramos prayed that God would take care of
her young family. But it wasn't always easy. They didn't have enough
money to buy a car.</TE>
<TE>   Ramos was resting on a bench near Georgia Avenue in Silver Spring,
reading a book and waiting for a ride to work, when she was shot and
killed.</TE>
<TE>   Her parents came from El Salvador for her funeral. Respecting her
wishes, they did not bring her home to El Salvador, but buried her in
the land where she hoped to find happiness.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Washington suburbs were a new world for Lori Ann Lewis-Rivera
when she moved from her childhood home in Mountain Home, Idaho, six
years ago. But she was determined to make a go of her life and her
new role as a nanny, a job she had wanted even as a teenager.</TE>
<TE>   Organized and determined, Lewis-Rivera, 25, got a job caring for
the two young children of a Washington family. She entered a
Spanish-speaking Mormon church she learned of through a nanny who was
her friend. She soon converted.</TE>
<TE>   And it was there she met Nelson Rivera, an immigrant from Honduras
who was working as a landscaper.</TE>
<TE>   Though they could hardly understand each other's language, they
soon married. Three years ago, they had a daughter. They moved into a
ground-floor apartment in Langley Park, northeast of Washington.</TE>
<TE>   With some financial help from her employer, she bought a handsome
burgundy minivan. She had stopped to vacuum the van at a Shell gas
station in Kensington on the morning when she was killed by the
sniper's bullet.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A friendly man who loved to chat and stroll, 72-year-old Pascal
Charlot was a familiar sight in his Northwest Washington
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   He was an immigrant who had moved from Haiti many years ago. Since
then, he had worked as a handyman. He also did odd jobs for
neighbors, fixing a cracked door here and mending a piece of broken
furniture there. He tended to his invalid wife, who lived with him
and his stepson in a brick row house in Washington near Silver
Spring.</TE>
<TE>   One of his pleasures was tending to his tiny backyard, where he
grew tomatoes and bell peppers. On steamy summer nights, Charlot was
known to sit on a chair and admire the garden.</TE>
<TE>   And he loved to walk even more. On the night he was killed by the
sniper, Charlot was standing on the corner of Georgia Avenue and
Kalmia Road, about 30 blocks from his home.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   James D. Martin, 55, was devoted to his church, his wife and the
11-year-old son, Ben, whom he had had late in life.</TE>
<TE>   He was buying sodas and snacks for his son's church youth group at
a Wheaton, Md., grocery when he became the sniper's first known
victim.</TE>
<TE>   Martin grew up in a family of modest means in rural Missouri in
the 1950s and moved to the Washington area after college.</TE>
<TE>   He had been working as a diversity coordinator at the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, because, according to his
boss, retired Adm. Conrad C. Lautenbacher Jr., "he was devoted to the
principle."</TE>
<TE>   Martin had also thrown himself into mentoring children at Shepherd
Elementary School in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   At his funeral, friends remembered him as a soft-spoken, gentle
man who loved helping children.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dean Harold Meyers' friends knew him as a man of hard work and
steady habits.</TE>
<TE>   For 20 years, Meyers, 53, had worked at a Manassas, Va., office of
the architectural engineering firm of Dewberry &amp; Davis LLC, taking
part in the company's biggest development projects.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors in Gaithersburg, Md., where he lived alone in a
townhouse for 25 years, knew him as a man who went to work early and
came home late.</TE>
<TE>   He remained close to his three brothers, whose children called him
Uncle Dean. He gave them rides in his classic Corvette.</TE>
<TE>   And he took care of his ailing 83-year-old mother.</TE>
<TE>   Meyers grew up in a suburb of Philadelphia and was drafted to
serve in Vietnam. He injured his arm in the war. In 1975, after his
service, he graduated from Penn State University.</TE>
<TE>   Meyers' older brother Greg was worried about him when he heard
that the sniper was loose in Washington. "I was thinking about
calling to talk to him about the situation down there, and how
cautious he was being," Greg said.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Meyers hadn't reached his brother before the sniper shot and
killed Dean as he stood beside his gray Mazda at a gas station in
Manassas.</TE>
<TE>   It was 8:15, and Dean Meyers had been working late.</TE>

<DH>On the forbidding frontier between Afghanistan and
Pakistan, more GIs are joining the search for the enemy. Their
mission is far different from that of the Special Forces.</DH>
<SE>THE UNTOLD WAR</SE>
<AU>David Zucchino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SARDAK, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>The search of Amar Gul's hut was yielding little until Pfc. Andrew
Johnson happened to notice a poster on the mud-brick wall. There,
smiling benevolently, was the face of Osama bin Laden.</LD>
<LD>   "Hey, sergeant, you gotta see this!" Johnson shouted to his squad
leader, Sgt. 1st Class Wylie Hutchison.</LD>
<LD>   Hutchison confronted Gul, a tall ethnic Pushtun with a wild black
beard. Gul claimed that the poster belonged to his uncle. It was a
mere advertisement, Gul said, a Bin Laden endorsement of a lottery in
Pakistan. He was certainly no supporter of Bin Laden's Al Qaeda
network.</LD>
<TE>   Hutchison snatched the poster from the wall and crumpled it. "I
don't believe you, man."</TE>
<TE>   With that, Amar Gul became a PUC -- a "person under control," one
more small fish caught up in the wide net cast by the Army's 82nd
Airborne Division in its pursuit of Al Qaeda and Taliban holdouts in
the unforgiving mountains that hug the Pakistani border.</TE>
<TE>   Like most Afghans detained by U.S. forces, Gul was interrogated
and released. And so the hunt wore on, day after day, night after
night, as paratroopers of the 3rd Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry
Regiment swept through high-desert villages.</TE>
<TE>   Wrapped in body armor, their M-4 automatic rifles locked and
loaded, the soldiers are the vanguard of an evolving U.S. strategy in
Afghanistan. Slowly but deliberately, the U.S. military is shifting
the troops it is using from unconventional to conventional forces.
Even with U.S. policymakers preoccupied by Iraq, large numbers of
American soldiers are now at work along the dangerous
Afghanistan-Pakistan border in combat operations virtually unknown to
the American public.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of deploying from the sprawling U.S. bases at Bagram and
Kandahar, hundreds of soldiers are mounting assaults from a forward
operating base in the border region -- the area where Bin Laden, if
he is still alive, is thought to be hiding. Rousing villagers in the
middle of the night, poking through their belongings and questioning
women as well as men, they are attempting to destroy the
infrastructure of Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters and sympathizers and
the way stations they use to move weapons, ammunition, equipment and
people between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Although the Americans often
come across hidden weapons, enemy fighters have usually slipped away.
The troops work hand in hand with small Army Special Forces teams in
a sometimes contentious partnership. For months, Special Forces "A
teams" have lived among Afghans, cultivating relationships and
developing intelligence on the hundreds of enemy fighters they
believe are in the region. Now the 82nd is acting on that
intelligence, searching villages and compounds in massive sweeps
backed by mortars, artillery and helicopter gunships.</TE>
<TE>   The Special Forces teams have provided brains, guile and
expertise. The 82nd units offer muscle and brute force, softened by a
patina of civility and public relations.</TE>
<TE>   After sometimes bitter complaints from Special Forces teams that
the 82nd was intimidating and alienating civilians, the soldiers now
explain their intentions to village elders. They ask permission to
search homes, and have female soldiers search women in a patriarchal
Pushtun culture obsessed with keeping women hidden and unpolluted by
the gaze of Western men. They are replacing smashed locks with new
ones. And they are accompanied by civil affairs teams offering
humanitarian aid and basic medical care.</TE>
<TE>   Commanders of the 82nd say the tactics are paying off. Searches in
recent weeks have yielded caches of mines, machine guns, explosives,
mortars, rocket-propelled grenades, artillery shells, armor-piercing
rounds, automatic rifles, radios and documents. In some cases, these
commanders say, Afghan civilians have directed soldiers to the
caches.</TE>
<TE>   Officers and enlisted men camped at the new base endure a charged
existence of anxiety and adrenaline, punctuated by intervals of
stupendous boredom. They are under constant threat of attack by an
unseen enemy. Almost every week, bases in the region are rocketed.
Soldiers live in fear of land mines, truck bombs or a grenade tossed
into a vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   While on combat missions or reconnaissance patrols, the soldiers
drive through gantlets of hostile and suspicious Afghans. Some people
wave and shout, "How are you!" But others glare and curse and show
the Americans the backs of their hands -- a grave insult. Children
beg for bottled water or pens, but a few pepper the soldiers' armored
Humvees with stones.</TE>
<TE>   At the camp, soldiers wearing towels around their waists and
scuffling through the dirt in flip-flops carry their automatic rifles
to and from showers and latrines. Even when they're tossing a
football or playing cards, their weapons are within arm's reach.</TE>
<TE>   Secrecy is paramount. A sign next to the telephone where soldiers
line up to call home reads: "Do not discuss classified material over
the phone. We'll be home when we get there."</TE>
<TE>   The battalion commander, Lt. Col. Martin Schweitzer, is the son of
a career soldier. He is tall and rangy, his face often smeared with
grime from the day's combat mission and his eyes red and swollen from
dust storms. "Our task is to destroy and kill Taliban and Al Qaeda
forces, and our purpose is to deny them sanctuary," he said. "We're
not into nation-building."</TE>
<TE>   The colonel and his men had just returned one recent night from a
mission that uncovered weapons now lying in the dust outside the
operations center: AK-47 assault rifles, boxes of ammunition, mortar
fuses, land mines and rocket-propelled grenades. There was also a
large wall hanging printed with a computer-generated photo depicting
the World Trade Center, the Sears Tower and other potential Al Qaeda
targets. The cover of an Al Qaeda propaganda cassette showed Bin
Laden wielding an automatic rifle and President Bush with blood
dripping down his face.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the soldiers complained that their commanders were showing
too much deference to women. Earlier that day, they said, a grenade
had tumbled to the floor of a hut from inside a woman's burka.
Soldiers grabbed it before it could be detonated. Of the 29 grenades
recovered that day, they said, two-thirds were found on women. On
three previous missions, female soldiers discovered hand grenades
strapped to women's thighs, cell phones strapped to their breasts and
rocket-propelled grenades hidden beneath burkas.</TE>
<TE>   Schweitzer said the practice of segregating women, then using
female soldiers to search them and their living areas, struck a
proper balance between security and respect for cultural
sensitivities.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't go in there and violate their cultural norms," he said.
"We own the terrain with their permission."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Operation Village Search</TE>
<TE>   Earlier on the morning that Amar Gul was detained, the battalion
seized the terrain around the hilltop village of Zakar-Khil near the
Pakistani border. Intelligence gathered by Special Forces teams
indicated that Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters had moved weapons into
and out of the village. Journalists who accompanied soldiers on this
and other missions agreed to restrict reporting of certain classified
details.</TE>
<TE>   A convoy of trucks and Humvees reached the village at dawn,
arriving in a storm of dust. Field radios squawked, and platoon
sergeants screamed out orders. Overhead, the rotors of Apache
gunships beat a steady whump, whump, whump.</TE>
<TE>   Delta Company was in first, establishing an "isolation ring"
around the village. Then came the paratroopers of Bravo Company,
grunting under the weight of their body armor as their boots pounded
the rocky soil. They fanned out and set up a perimeter, their weapons
aimed down alleys and into doorways.</TE>
<TE>   Like most villages in this heavily Pushtun region, Zakar-Khil had
been a Taliban stronghold. Many men in the area are Taliban
supporters, and some even fought for the movement. They did not
disappear with the fall of the Taliban; they merely faded into
prosaic village life.</TE>
<TE>   "The folks here really blend in," said Col. James Huggins, the
regiment commander. "You can't really tell the difference between an
Al Qaeda or a Taliban operative and a villager."</TE>
<TE>   The reaction in Zakar-Khil to the sudden invasion of Americans in
body armor was typical. The men and boys were sullen, suspicious and
resentful, the women fearful and wary.</TE>
<TE>   Dogs barked and cows bellowed as 1st Lt. Roman Skaskiw gathered
the village elders. Each wore a filthy shalwar kameez, the baggy
tunic and pantaloons favored by Afghan men. They were sleepy-eyed,
their black kohl eyeliner smeared and their henna-streaked beards wet
with sweat.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of a helmeted "terp" -- an Afghan interpreter -- the
lieutenant explained that he had come to search for Al Qaeda and
Taliban gunmen and weapons. He asked the men to gather their women to
be searched by a female lieutenant. He ordered them to bring out any
weapons. Personal weapons would not be seized, he explained, but any
hidden weapons would be confiscated and their owners detained.</TE>
<TE>   One of the elders produced a photocopied note signed by "Capt.
Jeff, U.S. Army." The note, written in English, said the village had
been searched and cleared of weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "Gotta be ODA," the lieutenant said. He meant Operational
Detachment A, or a Special Forces team.</TE>
<TE>   Such notes are photocopied and passed from village to village in
hopes they will prevent searches. Skaskiw shrugged and handed the
note back. Then he ordered his men to begin the sweep.</TE>
<TE>   House by house, the soldiers ducked into doorways as fellow
soldiers provided cover. They poked through old ammo crates crammed
with dishes, teacups and clothing. They looked under beds and inside
cupboards and unrolled long straw mats and bedding.</TE>
<TE>   They were coming up dry. Some of the soldiers muttered under their
breath. They had come to Afghanistan to kill the enemy, they said,
not to rattle around in people's bedrooms.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the problem," Hutchison said. "These people won't come out
and fight us. They just hang back and blend in."</TE>
<TE>   As the search wore on, Maj. Bill Bailey, a soft-spoken civil
affairs officer, huddled with the village headman. He asked about
wells, schools and medical needs in the area. Civil affairs teams
have repaired schools and bridges, dug wells and set up tuberculosis
clinics in areas where Afghans have cooperated with the searches.</TE>
<TE>   "Rule No. 1 for civil affairs is 'Never promise anything,' "
Bailey said later. He's a reservist, a correctional officer from
Penfield, N.Y. "But I do tell them that once the area is cleared of
terrorists and those who support terrorists, there's a strong
possibility that their needs will be provided for."</TE>
<TE>   Bailey carries a color-coded map of Afghanistan depicting various
regions as "cooperative," "noncooperative" and "attitude unknown."
Much of the country remains "attitude unknown."</TE>
<TE>   By midmorning, the search had unearthed a .50-caliber
armor-piercing round, a few suspicious passports with entry stamps
from hostile Arab countries such as Iraq and a walkie-talkie -- which
could be used to detonate land mines. The soldiers seemed heartened
when a villager hauled out four huge 107-millimeter artillery rounds.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, engineers!" a sergeant shouted to a group of combat
engineers. "You want to blow these up?"</TE>
<TE>   "Hoo-ah!" the engineers hollered, using the all-purpose rallying
cry favored by paratroopers and U.S. Army Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to blow them right here?"</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely!"</TE>
<TE>   Some recovered munitions are blown up on the spot for security
reasons. Others are passed on to headquarters. Some automatic rifles
and ammunition are given to the new Afghan army that is being formed
with the help of American military trainers.</TE>
<TE>   As the troops withdrew from Zakar-Khil, engineers detonated the
shells with an earth-shattering explosion and a flash of brilliant
orange that left behind a clink of falling shrapnel and a tall
mushroom cloud of dirty gray smoke. The villagers watched, awed and
fascinated.</TE>
<TE>   The next target was Amar Gul's village, a collection of mud-brick
compounds next to a dry riverbed. Villagers had complained to a
Special Forces team that a local gunman had set up an illegal
checkpoint, extorting money from passersby and confiscating their
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "We're gonna have a little talk with this guy," said Capt. Clay
Novak, the intense Bravo Company commander.</TE>
<TE>   A villager led the search team to Amar Gul, a fit young Pushtun
taller and heavier than most Afghan men. He carried himself with an
air of authority.</TE>
<TE>   Questioned by Bailey, Gul admitted operating a checkpoint near
Sardak but denied intimidating anyone or confiscating weapons. He
said the checkpoint was intended to block any infiltration by Al
Qaeda fighters. In fact, he said brightly, he could certainly use a
radio to make his self-appointed mission easier. Could the Americans
give him one?</TE>
<TE>   Bailey ignored the request.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been told you're stockpiling weapons. We're going to search
your compound and find out," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, I used to have eight machine guns I collected from
people," Gul confessed suddenly. "But then the people decided I should
give them back, so I did."</TE>
<TE>   A search of Gul's mud-walled home produced nothing. But in an
adjoining room that Gul claimed was used by his uncle, soldiers found
the Bin Laden poster. Gul was frisked and detained.</TE>
<TE>   In the next compound, soldiers found three grenades, two clips of
AK-47 ammunition and a few silver-tipped bullets.</TE>
<TE>   "Look -- armor-piercing rounds," said Staff Sgt. Damon Ritz. "Not
so nice."</TE>
<TE>   After two hours of searching, the soldiers left with their tiny
haul. After questioning, Gul was released.</TE>
<TE>   He approached Bailey.</TE>
<TE>   "You have come and searched our homes, and this I don't mind," he
said. "I've given you every kind of service you need." He seemed
about to ask for a radio again, but Bailey cut him off.</TE>
<TE>   "We're grateful," he said and began walking toward the convoy of
waiting Humvees and trucks.</TE>
<TE>   A village elder chased Bailey down and, through the
translator, made a request: Could he have one of those notes saying the
village had been searched and cleared?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Nighttime Mission</TE>
<TE>   Back at the base, Maj. Mike Richardson was hunched over a laptop
computer inside the command center. He was finalizing plans for a
nighttime sweep of four border villages that would involve several
hundred soldiers and a huge armored convoy.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson is the battalion S-3, or operations officer. Mannerly
and precise, he is a calm, orderly presence trailing in the wake of
the more volatile Schweitzer. Richardson helps Schweitzer and his top
officers make the most of intelligence</TE>
<TE>   Commanders are careful to vary the time and scale of combat sweeps
in order to keep the enemy and its sympathizers off balance. Each
sweep can be a rich source of intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   "When we go into an area, we create a big splash, like dropping a
big rock into a pond," Richardson said. "As the ripples go out, we
follow the ripples to see where they go."</TE>
<TE>   Since the forward base was established in late August, Schweitzer
said, the battalion has disrupted the movement of Al Qaeda and
Taliban fighters and supporters back and forth across the border.
That, he said, is as significant as the number of weapons seized or
PUCs interrogated.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as we're preventing them from operating, we're in their
decision cycle," Schweitzer said, chopping the air with his big hands
for emphasis. "And I think we're definitely in their decision cycle
to the point where they are very uncomfortable."</TE>
<TE>   But the enemy is able to take sanctuary in Pakistan's lawless
Pushtun tribal areas of Waziristan, just across the border. Small
groups of Special Forces and CIA and FBI agents reportedly operate
inside Pakistan, but U.S. commanders say no conventional forces are
there. Schweitzer said U.S. rules of engagement permit his troops to
cross into Pakistan under certain circumstances, such as after
attacks on U.S. forces by enemy fighters fleeing into Pakistan or
firing from inside that country.</TE>
<TE>   Inside Afghanistan, sweeps are planned in conjunction with Special
Forces teams. Both Schweitzer and his superior, Huggins, acknowledge
friction between the 82nd and Special Forces teams.</TE>
<TE>   "When we come into an area, we make their job harder," said
Huggins, a trim, silver-haired officer. "They're in there, small
signature, small focus, working with indigenous folks on gathering
intelligence to conduct an operation. When we come in, it's with a
big signature. We isolate an entire area, and it almost upsets their
battle rhythm, their mission."</TE>
<TE>   After the 82nd has left an area, Huggins said, Special
Forces teams "have to rebuild relationships because all of a sudden, you
know, there were an awful lot of U.S. soldiers in here."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, he added, "we absolutely complement each other because
they're gathering the intel, and it's us who's going in and doing the
dirty work."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Huggins spoke, an armored convoy rumbled out of the
base and headed to another mission, this time to a collection of
walled compounds near the border. For more than a week, someone in
those compounds had been "painting" helicopters flying into and out
of the base -- lighting them up with a spotlight. Schweitzer feared
that the enemy was practicing for an attempt to shoot down a
helicopter. He wanted the light source found and shut down.</TE>
<TE>   The job fell to Novak, a 29-year-old officer from Illinois.
At dawn, after Delta Company had moved in to seal the area, Novak's
Bravo Company began searching the compounds.</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers used bolt cutters to take a thick lock off a towering
metal gate at the first compound and were stunned by what lay inside.
They were accustomed to mud huts. This, by comparison, was a palace
-- a two-story villa with marble floors, verandas, indoor plumbing,
televisions and a satellite dish.</TE>
<TE>   It was the same at several other compounds. The owners of these
homes were hardly the illiterate peasants the soldiers usually
interrogated. They were the area's elite -- prosperous shop owners,
doctors, bankers. They were cooperative; they seemed to appreciate
the gentle way that Novak's subordinate, 1st Lt. Manny Ramirez, asked
them to collect their women in one room and bring out their personal
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Through the interpreter, Martinez asked one plump homeowner,
"Where are the bad guys?"</TE>
<TE>   "Some time ago, Al Qaeda and Taliban were here," the man said. "In
the last two months, they all went to Pakistan."</TE>
<TE>   Over the radio came Novak's voice: "Remember to keep asking about
the spotlighting. They'll be heroes if they tell us who's doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Martinez said to the homeowner: "We've seen spotlights
illuminating our aircraft. We don't appreciate that. If it continues,
we'll be back till it stops."</TE>
<TE>   "OK, OK," the man said. "We understand."</TE>
<TE>   Searches of the compounds produced very little -- a few AK-47s, a
machine gun, grenades and several century-old British Enfield
bolt-action rifles. The soldiers grew less tense. Some chatted with a
gathering swarm of children, who jabbered in their schoolbook
English.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey," one soldier joked to a boy. "Where's the anthrax at?"</TE>
<TE>   At one compound, soldiers tried not to laugh as Mohammed Zahir, a
thin man in flowing robes, made an elaborate show of welcoming them.
He fluttered through the compound, his arms flailing as he shooed
women into a back room and ordered his son to make tea for the
soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   "I am a banker!" Zahir kept shouting in English. "But still, I am
such a poor man!"</TE>
<TE>   Zahir proudly showed Martinez his AK-47 and ammo belt, along with
a brick-sized stack of blue afghani notes. He launched into a long
story about holding the money for other people. Martinez smiled and
said he could keep it.</TE>
<TE>   "Sorry for the inconvenience," Martinez said as the soldiers
completed their search.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," a soldier said, "you're the friendliest guy we've met
yet."</TE>
<TE>   By midday, the operation was over. The men filed into Humvees and
trucks for the bone-jarring ride back to base, disappointed that they
had not found more.</TE>
<TE>   But Schweitzer was pleased.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe we didn't find out who's been painting our aircraft, but
we've had seven aircraft land today and not one has been painted," he
said that night. "So I think they got the message."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Final Rehearsal</TE>
<TE>   On the afternoon before the four-village sweep that the battalion
was planning, Schweitzer ran his officers and noncommissioned
officers through a final rehearsal.</TE>
<TE>   Across a dusty patch of ground behind the command center, the four
targets were represented by cardboard signs. White tape that was
stretched across the ground showed attack routes. Empty bottled-water
boxes represented 105-millimeter artillery and 81-millimeter mortar
positions, and a two-sided cardboard sign that read "Afghanistan" and
"Pakistan" marked the border.</TE>
<TE>   At the far edge of the layout were the remote positions of scouts,
who would hike to mountain ridges with laser sights and scopes.
There, they would radio the main force if they spotted anyone trying
to escape -- or setting up an ambush.</TE>
<TE>   The men literally walked through their paces, with the leaders of
each unit striding over ground that represented the miles they would
cover early the next morning. The Black Hawk crew chiefs walked over
the routes they would use to haul in troops. The Apache gunship
chiefs rehearsed their positions.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Patrick Willis, the S-2, or intelligence officer, warned
that Pakistani militias were just across the border. Poorly paid and
poorly led, they were known to allow Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters
passage in exchange for money. The militias were also poorly
disciplined, so Willis reviewed the effective kill range of their
mortars and cannons.</TE>
<TE>   This mission was particularly dangerous because it was the
battalion's first night sweep. The targets were within a mile or two
of the border, so commanders decided to strike while villagers slept,
in hopes of preventing the removal of weapons to Pakistan. Under
nighttime conditions, only soldiers with life-threatening wounds
would be airlifted out; "routine casualties" would be treated in the
field until the 22-hour mission was over.</TE>
<TE>   Schweitzer spoke to his troops about dealing with civilians roused
from sleep.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to be groggy, not as receptive as daytime," he
said. "We have to be more considerate and precise going in. When you
go into someone's house, it's a forced intervention. They may say
you're welcome, but they don't mean it. It's an unwelcome event."</TE>
<TE>   The troops made one final walk-through -- the contingency
rehearsal in which they reviewed their responsibilities in the event
of casualties, accidents or foul weather. It was a thorough, crisp
workout.</TE>
<TE>   "Well done!" Schweitzer said when it was over. "Now let's take
another great opportunity to go out and get these .... "</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the hot, dry afternoon, soldiers in their tents
prepared for the mission. In their constricted world, day or night
has become irrelevant. They are on Zulu time, or Greenwich mean time.
They have no fixed sleeping or eating patterns. They might eat dinner
at 4:30 p.m. local time, fall asleep around 7 p.m. and rise at 3 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Off-Duty Life</TE>
<TE>   Between missions, they do what soldiers have done for centuries:
They grouse and curse and complain. They moan about RON missions --
remain overnight, sleeping on the ground. They fantasize about cold
beer, for alcohol is prohibited. They speak endlessly of women, with
the handful of female soldiers on base the objects of boundless
fascination.</TE>
<TE>   Food is another obsession. "T-rats," or T-rations, the dense slabs
of prepared meals, are compared, unfavorably, to dog food. "MREs," or
meals ready to eat, are viewed more benignly, primarily because the
sealed plastic bags contain candy, peanut butter and sweet beverage
powders. Mothers across America would be horrified to know that their
boys often start their days with Tootsie Rolls, Skittles and a bag of
dry cocoa powder.</TE>
<TE>   In the airless, crowded tents, there is an elaborate code of
behavior. Intestinal distress, a common malady, should never be
attended to within the confines of the tent.</TE>
<TE>   Filching the candy or other coveted items from MREs -- and leaving
someone stuck with, say, pressed and formed meatloaf -- is a fighting
offense.</TE>
<TE>   This is a war for the young. Some paratroopers are 18 or 19,
barely removed from high school days of drinking beer and chasing
girls. There is frequent belching, spitting, chomping of chewing
tobacco or snuff -- and elaborate bursts of profanity.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers look fearsome and automated with their body armor and
high-tech weapons, but most are very young men fighting off fear or
exhaustion or trouble back home. They might have a worried mother, a
hospitalized father, a wife cracking under the strain of loneliness
or a girlfriend weary of waiting. Army psychologists say the Dear
John letter -- now the Dear John e-mail -- is as devastating as any
form of combat stress.</TE>
<TE>   There is also the frustration of being armed and primed, with no
one to attack. Actual contact with an armed enemy is infrequent. Al
Qaeda and Taliban fighters are outnumbered and outgunned. Instead of
fighting pitched battles, they rely on stealth, roadside bombs, land
mines and terror.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers are outfitted with the latest technology, much of it
superior to equipment used as recently as the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
They have streamlined M-4 rifles with infrared laser sights that put
a red dot on the target. They have NODs, night optical devices, that
turn night into day, laser pointers that spotlight targets for attack
aircraft, thermal imaging devices that detect body heat and global
positioning systems accurate to within a yard.</TE>
<TE>   "We own the night," Schweitzer said just before the mission. As
the hour to launch the mission approached, he was certain that there
were plenty of enemy fighters within the border target area, if only
his troops could flush them out.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe it's a target-rich environment," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hitting Them Hard</TE>
<TE>   The convoy from Task Force Panther pulled out in blackness, lights
out, NODs on. It was just after 7 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The chaplain, Capt. Thomas Helms, had just delivered a prayer: "If
we are engaged, we pray that we carry out our duty, that we make the
U.S. a safer place."</TE>
<TE>   First Lt. Steve Messenger, a slender, cerebral Delta Company
platoon leader, was worried about reaching his assigned target along
rocky, winding dirt tracks in the mountains. A reconnaissance patrol
had driven the route in daylight the day before, but Messenger had
checked the satellite imagery, and not all the trails matched up.</TE>
<TE>   And he had to find the way at night. He knew from the patrol that
some of the switchbacks were dangerously narrow and unstable.</TE>
<TE>   "Hug the walls, not the frigging sides," Messenger ordered his
Humvee drivers. "We're not going over the frigging side!"</TE>
<TE>   One especially skilled driver, Spc. Joshua Sheehan, performed a
remarkable three-point turn on a high mountain pass, maneuvering his
armored Humvee completely around only inches from a sheer drop of a
couple of hundred feet.</TE>
<TE>   It took seven hours of driving to reach a site that the patrol had
reached in three hours in daylight. But they arrived in time to set
up their assigned blocking position, and they settled in to await the
arrival of the Black Hawks ferrying Bravo Company to a landing zone
in a dry riverbed.</TE>
<TE>   It was well before first light when the helicopters roared in,
disgorging soldiers in full battle gear. The mortar and artillery
teams set up their positions. The scouts were waiting on the
ridgelines.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, over the target village of Masi Kalay, the Black Hawk
pilots ferrying Alpha Company spotted 20 to 30 men fleeing toward the
border. They could not tell whether the men were armed, but they
assumed they were enemy fighters or supporters. The men reached
Pakistan before Alpha Company could intercept them.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next several hours, soldiers searched the village,
finding little of interest. But just after 8 a.m., someone noticed a
locked door inside a stone compound. The woman who owned the compound
claimed that she didn't have a key. Soldiers broke down the door.</TE>
<TE>   Stacked inside were land mines, hand grenades, 250
rocket-propelled grenades, thousands of rounds of heavy machine-gun
ammunition, and mortar rounds still tucked inside their original foam
packing. The woman claimed that the weapons belonged to her dead
husband, who she said had fought the Soviets in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   A military intelligence officer didn't believe her.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you gonna stop lying to me?" he asked her. "Are you gonna
tell me who this belongs to?"</TE>
<TE>   Finally, after the woman had been interrogated for nearly an hour,
her daughter confessed that the weapons belonged to her brother, the
woman's son. She said he was in Pakistan, out of the Americans'
reach.</TE>
<TE>   Though they had not captured anyone, the soldiers had uncovered a
significant arms cache. And there was more: A village elder told them
that another big weapons cache had been moved two days earlier to a
nearby village.</TE>
<TE>   That village turned out to be Alpha Company's next target: the
hamlet of Golamkhan Kalay, less than two-thirds of a mile from the
Pakistani border. Hoping to reach the hamlet before villagers could
haul the weapons to Pakistan, commanders radioed the forward base,
where the Black Hawks had returned. They ordered Charlie Company
airlifted to Golamkhan Kalay.</TE>
<TE>   Charlie Company was the quick-reaction force, on alert at the base
for just such a contingency. The Black Hawks quickly ferried the
company to the hamlet.</TE>
<TE>   As Charlie Company paratroopers searched Golamkhan
Kalay, Pakistani militiamen watching from ridges across the border hiked
down and accused the Americans of crossing into Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   The paratroopers swung their weapons toward the Pakistanis.
Schweitzer radioed for air support and ordered the mortar teams to
prepare a warning round. The Pakistanis left.</TE>
<TE>   The search resumed, and soldiers soon uncovered an enormous cache.
It took two typewritten pages to list it all: 319 boxes of
machine-gun ammunition, 79 mortar rounds, 17 artillery rounds, a
Russian-made missile, 269 rocket-propelled grenades. Particularly
worrying were 40 antipersonnel mines and four antitank mines capable
of destroying an armored Humvee.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the munitions were blown up on the spot. The rest were
loaded up for transfer back to base.</TE>
<TE>   It had been a good day. The soldiers marched out, weary but
satisfied.</TE>
<TE>   They hiked to a plateau to await the Black Hawks. Some of them
flopped on the rocky ground, their huge rucksacks still strapped to
their backs, and fell asleep.</TE>
<TE>   At Bravo Company's landing zone a mile away, some of Novak's men
were dozing too. They had searched several compounds and caves at two
border target sites but found little. The captain took off his
rucksack and rested on one knee. He knew his men were frustrated. He
was frustrated too. He was missing his wife and 13-month-old
daughter, not to mention his chocolate Labrador retriever and duck
season. And now his company's first night mission had not produced
much.</TE>
<TE>   "Not our day," he said. "But Alpha and Charlie turned up some good
stuff, so everybody's happy about that."</TE>
<TE>   He felt bad for his men.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys came over here to kill people threatening America, and
so far they haven't really done that," he said. "But we're causing
the enemy all kinds of problems, and that's important too."</TE>
<TE>   At dusk, the Black Hawks swooped in and took everyone back to
base. Soldiers unloaded the day's haul at the operations center,
where Schweitzer stood and stared at the big stacks of weapons and
ammo.</TE>
<TE>   He was filthy and exhausted, and the lines in his face looked deep
in the dim light.</TE>
<TE>   The mission had taken 22 hours, and nobody had slept since two
nights earlier. But there was a smile above the stubble on
Schweitzer's jaw.</TE>
<TE>   "Damn, we hit 'em hard today," he said. He smacked his fist into
his palm. "And we're gonna go back and hit 'em again."</TE>

<HD>Iraqis Resigned to Threat of War</HD>
<DH>Baghdad's residents are going on as usual because 'their
destiny comes at God's will,' and they've been down this road before.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Slackman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>Food rations have been doubled for the last two months, the military
is on alert, the ruling Baath Socialist Party's militia is patrolling
outside ministry buildings, and antiaircraft artillery has been
positioned in key areas.</LD>
<LD>   Still, people here insist that they have made few plans of their
own to cope with a war.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush wants to topple Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and
if he can't do it by saber-rattling, he has said he is prepared to
send in the U.S. military. But this city of nearly 5 million seems to
be sleepwalking through the crisis. It is not that the people don't
recognize the risk they are facing, especially since the nation's
military strategy appears aimed at luring American troops into urban
locations, where Iraqis feel they will have a fighting chance.</LD>
<TE>   It just means that they are accustomed to living under threat--and
they are numb. With the hammer hanging over them, they are simply
trying to get on with their lives.</TE>
<TE>   "Iraqis are Muslims, and they feel their destiny comes at God's
will," Saad Naji Jawad, a political science professor at Baghdad
University and a shopkeeper, said the other day. "But that doesn't
mean they aren't scared of a coming war."</TE>
<TE>   For 22 years, Iraqis have endured the hardships of war and
economic sanctions. No matter whose fault that was, it changed their
way of life, forced them to become experts on getting by and gave
them a feeling that they can survive almost anything. Now, they just
figure that they are going to have to do it again.</TE>
<TE>   "It will not affect us," said Raad Ishak, 47, owner-operator of a
dry cleaning business in the Christian neighborhood of
Karada-Erkheta. "We are used to living in such conditions."</TE>
<TE>   Ishak did say that if there is a war, he expects to close his
shop, the sole source of income for 20 people. Electricity will
probably be cut off. Water may stop running. And his children's
school is likely to be closed. He can't sleep at night because he is
worried that his kids could be injured.</TE>
<TE>   What he means is, he'll survive.</TE>
<TE>   "What can we do? We are just ordinary citizens," he said, in a
reflection of the fatalism that seems to have gripped the capital.</TE>
<TE>   The last time the United States led a coalition against Iraq, in
1991, the fight took place in the desert. As Iraqi forces withdrew
from Kuwait, they were easy targets and were devastated by U.S. air
power. When they took cover in trenches carved in the sand, coalition
forces buried them alive with earthmoving equipment. This time, if
there is a war, it could well be centered here, in the city of a
thousand and one nights, a city whose history is tied to the birth of
civilization.</TE>
<TE>   Baghdad may no longer be known as a place where parents want to
send their children to study medicine, but it remains home to an
ethnically and religiously diverse population. The streets they live,
work and play on could well become America's next battlefield in a
fight that Deputy Prime Minister Tarik Aziz has promised would be "a
fierce war."</TE>
<TE>   Yet despite wars and sanctions, Baghdad is a dynamic, if stressed,
city. It stretches along the Tigris River, with the districts of
Rusafah on the east and the Karkh on the west. Eleven bridges connect
the banks, and the fact that bridges bombed by the U.S. have been
rebuilt has added to the sense among citizens that the city and its
people can endure anything.</TE>
<TE>   Fadhwat Arab is the center of Baghdad. The rundown, litter-strewn
neighborhood is a few blocks from the city's municipal building, a
giant brick edifice that is testimony to the power of local
authorities. Fadhwat Arab also represents the mix that is Baghdad:
3,600 residents who are Sunni and Shiite Muslims, Kurds and
Turkomans, even Christians.</TE>
<TE>   Yadullah Nouri Ali, 61, lives there, inside the shell of a
collapsed building, with 10 family members. His home is a courtyard
covered with corrugated metal. He was an ironworker but, like most of
his neighbors, now has trouble scraping together the 10,000 dinars
(about $5) a day he needs to support his family.</TE>
<TE>   Like his neighbors, too, Ali has lived through a lot of war. He
took shelter in the 1980s, when Iran bombed Baghdad, but he has many
times stood outside listening to the bombs the U.S. has dropped on
his country. His fortunes, meanwhile, have paralleled Iraq's economic
path, and that has been down and down. After the Persian Gulf War, he
was forced to sell all of his possessions just to feed his family.</TE>
<TE>   Ali has plenty of reasons to be angry at his government. And
perhaps he is, though it is impossible to know in a place like Iraq,
where self-expression is not exactly encouraged. But he also seems
sincerely offended at the notion that American forces could roll
through his neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite the fact I am an old man, I can confront 20 Americans if
I have to," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Zahara Abdullah, 47, was like-minded: "Do you
accept that your government will attack and assault this neighborhood
and our children? He is our president. You are not our custodian."</TE>
<TE>   The couple have been through so much that survival has become
their way of life. They are bracing for the inevitable losses of
electricity and running water. Their 19-year-old son, Mohammed, will
probably lose his $20-a-month job working a lathe. And their
11-year-old grandson is worried that he won't be able to go to school
or train to become a doctor.</TE>
<TE>   "I am afraid they will bomb my school and that I will not be able
to study," the boy said. "This is what I am afraid of."</TE>
<TE>   But Ali and his family refuse to make any preparations. Perhaps
the reason is misguided pride, of which there seems to be no shortage
here. Or perhaps it is a conviction that, in the end, their leaders
will do all they can to avoid a war--a conviction that also seems
widespread. In any event, they simply reject the notion of getting
ready, as do their neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   "We will never make preparations," said Salah Nuaimi, 71, who has
lived his whole life in the neighborhood. "Why? Because of God.
Everything is from him."</TE>
<TE>   Across town, Layuth Ghanim, 42, stood in the shadow of the Lady of
Salvation Church. The church is Syrian Catholic and draws 1,000
congregants every Sunday. The sounds of students from the church
school echoed off the soaring white edifice as Ghanim expressed the
same thoughts Ali had.</TE>
<TE>   "We are living in such a situation for years," Ghanim said while
waiting to pick up his three children from classes. "We are used to
this. I don't think even if it is worse it will be different than
last time."</TE>
<TE>   One sign here of the years of sanctions imposed on Iraq after the
Gulf War is the number of rundown cars crowding the streets. But
those thoroughfares also serve as an example of the country's
resilience, not only with the traffic that chokes them but with the
many luxury cars that also cruise up and down. Nowhere is this more
evident than in Arasat al Hindiya, the city's most upscale
neighborhood. The municipality is widening the sidewalks there with
octagon-shaped tiles for pedestrians interested in shopping in the
luxury boutiques or dining in the fancy restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   If anywhere in Baghdad has a lot to lose, it is Arasat al Hindiya,
whose residents live in grand villas rising behind wrought-iron
gates. But there as well, residents and shopkeepers are refusing to
alter their daily lives because of the prospect of war.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe in 1991, at that time, there was fear," said Maan Samaraa,
27, part owner of a fabric shop called Ashram. "But after that and
throughout the years, with the many bombings, we got used to it. For
me, I am not afraid of what will happen. I can tell you with strict
determination and will, we will not be affected."</TE>
<TE>   None of this is to say that Baghdad's authorities are not, at
least, trying to prepare their people for what could be a serious
fight. One analyst said he expects that if there is an invasion, the
ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party will hand out weapons to the few
residents of the city who don't already own guns.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the practical measures they are taking, like
distributing extra food, officials also seem to be working on
psychological preparations. At the Mother of All Battles Mosque, a
huge house of worship dedicated to the Gulf War, Imam Abdul Latif
Humain was trying to rally the troops Friday and brace them for what
might be a very one-sided war.</TE>
<TE>   "Our cause is depending on faith and justice," he said to several
hundred men and women seated inside the mosque during the Friday
prayer ceremony. "The U.S. is lacking these two qualities--faith and
justice.... We have faith, which is better than huge numbers of
soldiers."</TE>

<HD>182 Killed in Blast Outside Bali Nightclubs</HD>
<DH>Authorities blame terrorists for the powerful explosion in
Indonesia's tourist hub. Many of the dead and injured are foreigners.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard C. Paddock</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>A powerful car bomb exploded outside two popular nightclubs on the
island of Bali on Saturday night, killing at least 182 people, most
of them foreigners, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of people were injured, including at least one American,
in what police said was a terrorist attack. Among the victims were
tourists from Australia, Britain, Germany, Switzerland and France, as
well as Indonesian club employees.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses said the bombing occurred about 11:30 p.m. when the
nightclubs were packed with young foreign tourists. The blast left a
crater 5 feet deep in the street outside the clubs.</LD>
<TE>   "This bombing incident is a warning that terrorism is a real and
potential danger to our national security," Indonesian President
Megawati Sukarnoputri told reporters today before leaving for Bali.
She gave the toll of 182.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the worst act of terror in Indonesia's history," said
Gen. Dai Bachtiar, the national police chief. "We have to be more
alert for other acts of terror."</TE>
<TE>   The blast destroyed the Sari Club and Paddy's Irish Club and
ignited a fire that blazed out of control for more than an hour,
gutting neighboring buildings in the Kuta district of Bali.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Lloyd, a tourist from San Clemente, said he rushed to the
site from his hotel and saw a horrific scene of carnage, with body
parts strewn over the street.</TE>
<TE>   "I pulled out bodies with no arms. I pulled out live bodies with
no legs," he said. "There were heads lying all around."</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd, 31, who joined other bystanders in helping to rescue
survivors, said he believed the death toll could easily reach 300.
Police were still pulling bodies from the rubble this morning.</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd and other witnesses said they heard two explosions--a small
blast followed moments later by a huge blast that shattered windows
within a half-mile radius.</TE>
<TE>   About the same time, another bomb went off about 100 yards from
the U.S. Honorary Consulate on Bali in nearby Denpasar, but it caused
no casualties. There were unconfirmed reports of at least one other
bombing.</TE>
<TE>   No one claimed responsibility for the blasts, but suspicion
immediately fell on Islamic extremists, who have been blamed for
dozens of bombings elsewhere in the country in the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   "It does look as though a terrorist organization was involved,"
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said in a television
interview in Australia. "It clearly looks as though this attack has
been coordinated, and it clearly looks like an attack against foreign
interests."</TE>
<TE>   If the explosion proves to have been a terrorist assault, it would
quite likely be the deadliest anywhere since the Sept. 11 attacks on
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, U.S. officials have warned Americans to be on the
alert for an attack in Indonesia. At one point, they closed the
embassy in Jakarta, the capital, for several days.</TE>
<TE>   Bali, a predominantly Hindu island east of Java, the main island,
had remained largely untouched by the violence that has plagued much
of Indonesia. The popular tourist hub had been regarded as the safest
place in Indonesia to visit.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesia's Metro TV showed grisly footage of bodies piled up
after the blast and of rescue workers covering other bodies with
sheets outside the clubs. Dozens of wounded lay in hospital wards,
including some on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Nurdy Ansyah, an employee at a nearby guest house, said he rushed
to the scene after the explosion and helped load the dead and wounded
into ambulances.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw so many dead bodies at first I thought I was dreaming," he
said. "The smell was so strong.... I think a bomb was in a car. It
was a very huge explosion."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Puta Putra Wisade, communications chief at Sanga Hospital on
Bali, said that 150 bodies had arrived at the hospital and that 75%
of them were foreigners. Doctors at the hospital were treating about
200 victims, he said. Five smaller hospitals in the area also
received dead and injured from the scene, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The bomb apparently was placed closest to the Sari Club, an
open-sided bar that featured a disco with a giant video screen and
catered almost exclusively to young foreigners. The club was
especially popular with Australians and was full of people at the
time of the bombing. It was incinerated within minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said a fireball from the blast also hit Paddy's, which
was across the street from the Sari Club and about 50 feet away. It
too was destroyed in minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Police said 27 buildings in the area were razed. The fire took
about three hours to contain.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a terrorist attack, and the police condemn this act of
terror," said Indonesian police spokesman Saleh Saaf. "This was a
coldblooded action."</TE>
<TE>   For a year, Indonesia has been under pressure from the U.S. and
neighboring countries to crack down on terrorists believed to be
operating here.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials worry that terrorists linked to Al Qaeda have moved
to Indonesia, home to the world's largest Muslim population and a
sprawling archipelago where law enforcement is often ineffective.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesia also has been criticized for not taking action against
Muslim cleric Abu Bakar Bashir, who is accused of heading an
international terrorist group that plotted to blow up the U.S.
Embassy and other targets in Singapore late last year.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesian officials, however, have been reluctant to admit that
terrorists with international links may be based here for fear of
antagonizing the country's vocal Muslim activists. Parliament has
been slow to adopt any legislation that could help in fighting
terrorist activity.</TE>
<TE>   But the government began taking a stronger stance today.
"Terrorism is in Indonesia," security chief Susilo Bambang
Yudhoyonosaid. "Terrorism is in front of our eyes. I ask all
Indonesian people to support the government efforts to combat
terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   The attack in Bali could prove devastating to Indonesia's tourist
trade and its struggling economy.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesia has never recovered from the 1997 Asian economic
collapse, but Bali was one bright spot where tourism has even made a
comeback since the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   With Saturday's bombing, hotel operators and residents fear that
tourists will stop coming to Bali.</TE>
<TE>   Long lines were reported at the airport today as many tourists
scrambled to leave the island as quickly as possible after the
bombing.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's trying to get out of here," said Lloyd, a surfer who
had spent Friday evening at the Sari Club. "The Bali people are so
bummed because they know this is going to kill their tourism."</TE>

<HD>Explosion at Finnish Mall Kills Bombing Suspect and 6
Others</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeffrey Fleishman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>An explosion that ripped through a shopping mall in Finland, killing
seven people, injuring 80 and jolting the serenity of a nation,
apparently was detonated by a troubled chemistry student who had
downloaded bomb-making instructions from the Internet, police and
media reports said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Finnish authorities described the suspect in the Friday night
blast, who was among the dead, as a 19-year-old student at a
technical school outside the capital, Helsinki. They said a search of
the young man's apartment revealed that he was psychologically
disturbed and that he had searched the Internet for tips on
constructing a homemade bomb.</LD>
<LD>   The powerful 5-pound device--small enough for the suspect to
conceal--was packed with gunshot pellets and metal shards. The blast
sent glass and steel flying and terrified 2,000 shoppers in the
Myyrmanni mall, 10 miles north of Helsinki in the town of Vantaa.</LD>
<TE>   "Nothing like this has ever happened in Finland before," said
Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen, who called his government into an
emergency session. "The information we have suggests that the
explosives were constructed so as to cause the largest possible
damage."</TE>
<TE>   In the hours immediately after the blast, government officials did
not rule out the possibility of a planned terrorist attack. But as
the investigation widened, it appeared less likely that a radical
organization was behind the devastation. No group claimed
responsibility for the attack, whose fatalities included one child.</TE>
<TE>   The suspect, whose name was not released, had no criminal record,
police said. He was not believed to have been a political or
religious extremist, according to Finnish media reports.</TE>
<TE>   The prime minister described the incident as "an act of terror in
a sense" because the blast tore through a mall busy with weekend
shoppers. Finnish Chief Police Supt. Tero Haapala said the bomb was
built with "some sort of professional knowledge." But he added: "At
this moment we have no motive."</TE>
<TE>   The bomb exploded on the mall's ground floor, near where a clown
vendor had been selling balloons minutes earlier. Five people were
killed instantly, and two others died in local hospitals. The blast
damaged 3,000 square feet. It also caused part of a ceiling to
collapse, and many of those injured were struck with glass and
falling debris, media reports said.</TE>
<TE>   Finnish TV showed images of scared and bloody shoppers, crying and
fleeing the mall as ambulances, police and firefighters converged on
it.</TE>
<TE>   "We are quite depressed," said Kimmo Oksanen, an editor at
Helsingin Sanomat, Finland's major newspaper. "There is a lot of
shrapnel in the bodies of the victims. This bomb was designed to
devastate."</TE>
<TE>   Lipponen and Finnish President Tarja Halonen attended a memorial
service along with members of a figure-skating club who lost a
teammate. Much of the Nordic nation of 5.2 million was in shock. With
one of the lowest crime rates in Europe, Finland seldom experiences
such a blow to the national psyche. Most violent crime, including a
car bombing in July, occurs among organized gangs.</TE>
<TE>   But as the International Committee of the Red Cross made a plea
for blood donations, and as news broke that many of the wounded had
lost limbs, the bishop of Helsinki, Eero Huovinen, said the nation's
sense of security had been shattered.</TE>
<TE>   "Distress grew when we heard this was a crime," the prelate said,
adding that his country "is no longer a haven of safety."</TE>
<TE>   Russian President Vladimir V. Putin sent a message of condolence,
and the French Foreign Ministry labeled the bombing an "odious act."</TE>
<TE>   Reports immediately after the explosion suggested that the cause
might have been faulty gas cylinders. But that notion was dispelled
after a bomb squad and chemical-sniffing dogs scoured the scene
through the night. By sunrise Saturday, it had become apparent that
the explosion was deliberate.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the largest civilian disaster to affect the Greater
Helsinki area since the war," Interior Minister Ville Itala said.</TE>

<HD>Iraq Continues to Stall U.N. Inspections</HD>
<DH>For the second time in a week, the government fails to
confirm accord on ground rules.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maggie Farley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>UNITED NATIONS -- Iraq continued sending mixed messages Saturday
about its willingness to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspections,
suggesting that the problems that hampered previous inspections are
bedeviling a new mission before it even begins.</LD>
<LD>   In Baghdad, Iraq's inspections chief, Gen. Hussan Mohammed Amin,
said the country reserves the right to end its cooperation with U.N.
inspections if it regards them as tools of U.S. espionage or
manipulation.</LD>
<LD>   "We gave commitments to cooperate if they said they will follow
scientific and logical measures for inspections and will not misuse
them for spying, collecting information," Amin told Associated Press.
He spoke during a press tour of the Al Furat industrial site, which
Iraq concedes was once part of a nuclear program but says is used now
for repairing electronic military equipment. Washington has pointed
out recent construction at the site on satellite photos, raising
questions about whether the nuclear program is still alive.</LD>
<TE>   "If they will follow scientific measures and they will take
measures from the United Nations and not the United States, they
should come," Amin said of the inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   But for the second time in a week, Iraq failed to certify
agreements reached this month in Vienna on the inspections' ground
rules, causing U.S. officials to say that such backtracking showed
that Baghdad's invitation for new inspections was simply a stalling
tactic.</TE>
<TE>   An Oct. 8 letter from U.N. chief weapons inspector Hans Blix and
Mohammed Baradei of the International Atomic Energy Agency, detailing
the terms of upcoming inspections, asked Iraq to confirm its
acceptance of the verbal agreements made in Vienna -- as the Security
Council had requested. But an Oct. 10 response from the Iraqi
presidential advisor who attended the Vienna meetings avoided
affirming the contents of that letter and raised new issues.</TE>
<TE>   After U.S. officials denounced the reply as an "attempt to delay
and deceive," the advisor, Gen. Amir Saadi, sent a clarification
Saturday. The new missive said his initial letter should not be seen
as "an objection" to terms "but rather as an explanation of our
understanding as to what was agreed upon in Vienna," according to an
unofficial translation obtained by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   "We are prepared to find a solution to all the issues that might
obstruct our joint cooperation in a professional, constructive and
positive manner," Saadi wrote. But he still failed to confirm the
detailed agreement described in Blix and Baradei's Oct. 8 letter.</TE>
<TE>   The Saturday letter also avoided discussion of access to Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's compounds and raised reservations about
the "no-fly" zones that U.S. and British warplanes are patrolling
over the country and about interviews with Iraqi citizens.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. inspectors had asked to talk to Iraqi scientists and others
with information about the country's weapons programs without a
roomful of government minders, to reduce any potential intimidation.
A U.S. proposal for a new resolution goes further, asking that
interviewees be taken out of the country, along with their families,
to ensure frank discussions.</TE>
<TE>   But in Vienna, diplomats at the talks said, Iraqi officials raised
concerns about the rights and safety of their citizens and said most
people would be afraid to be interviewed alone without Iraqi
witnesses to back up what was said.</TE>
<TE>   "They still haven't said yes," said Richard A. Grenell, spokesman
for the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, John D. Negroponte.
"There should be a very simple answer: 'Yes, we will allow
unfettered, unconditional inspections.' This latest letter only
underscores the need for international pressure from the Security
Council--one voice--to get Iraq to comply with all resolutions and
disarm completely."</TE>
<TE>   Other diplomats said that the more Iraq stalls, the more it plays
into Washington's hands. The U.S. is prepared to intervene militarily
to force Iraq to disarm if it does not comply with weapons
inspections.</TE>
<TE>   The majority of the 15-member Security Council prefers to
forestall the use of force. This week will be devoted to wrangling
over the wording of a new resolution defining the mandate of the
inspectors and specifying exactly how to determine whether their
mission has failed and whether force should be used.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has proposed a single resolution saying that Iraq will
face "consequences" if it fails to disarm or blocks inspectors'
efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Though negotiations are still very fluid, a possible compromise,
U.N. diplomats said, might be to approve "consequences" without
spelling out the use of military force.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. says past resolutions finding Iraq in "material breach"
provide a legal basis for military action.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Standing Has Diminished Among Germans</HD>
<DH>America's policies fuel the image of a swaggering
gunslinger, a far cry from the era when it shielded Europe from the
Soviet Union's grasp.</DH>

<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>Heinz Pieske's love affair with America began decades ago when he was
a boy with a rifle in the ranks of a battered German army.</LD>
<LD>   It was 1944, on the sandy fringes of Normandy. A U.S. paratrooper,
floating in a gray sky and firing a gun, shot the 17-year-old Pieske
in the shoulder. A few months later, Pieske was locked in the hold of
a cargo ship on his way across the Atlantic to a prisoner of war camp
in Tennessee, where -- he laughs about it even now -- he cut down
trees in a big forest.</LD>
<LD>   "I liked it in America," he said. "The work wasn't too bad. The
food was good. It was better than life under Hitler."</LD>
<TE>   That stay of blistered hands and healing wounds left its imprint
on Pieske, whose admiration of the United States was the hallmark of
the generation growing up in Germany after World War II. But over
time and against a backdrop of shifting world orders and divergent
national interests, that loyalty has frayed as U.S.-German relations
have sunk to their lowest point in 60 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not anti-American," said Hildegard Dukes, standing in a brisk
wind recently in downtown Berlin. "I'm grateful for what America did
for us in the past. But America is acting strangely, and it gives me
the creeps."</TE>
<TE>   Attempting to fathom American policies on everything from Iraq to
global warming has become an excruciating pastime for this nation of
82 million. A once-stalwart ally that shielded many Germans from the
grip of the Soviet Union, the U.S. these days is often viewed as a
shrill-twanged gunslinger out to crush its enemies at the expense of
its friends.</TE>
<TE>   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's refusal this summer to send German
troops into a possible war with Iraq helped him win reelection, but
it ignited a diplomatic crisis with Washington that is now only
beginning to ease.</TE>
<TE>   The rift had been widening before that. The Bush administration's
rejection of environmental treaties and its refusal to permit U.S.
forces to be tried in an international court for war crimes convinced
many Germans that their superpower friend was placing itself above
the world community.</TE>
<TE>   Germany has also developed a bit of a swagger since the end of the
Cold War.</TE>
<TE>   Stepping away from the horrors of its Nazi past and shedding some
of its self-doubt and guilt, Germany in recent years has moved into
the limelight on the global stage. Despite setbacks, it remains the
world's third-largest economy and the linchpin of the European Union.
Recently elected as a nonpermanent member of the U.N. Security
Council, Germany has found a voice and is no longer shy about its
opinions.</TE>
<TE>   "For too many years, we've been the servants of the U.S.A.,"
scoffed a white-bearded man who gave his name only as Mr. Dietrich.
"I was 16 years old when the army sent me to Berlin and told me to
shoot down Allied bombers. I just had a little flak gun, didn't hit a
thing.... And now Bush wants to start another war."</TE>
<TE>   Attitudes toward the U.S. shift along generational and
geographical lines. Dietrich aside, most older western Germans still
revere America. They remember Eisenhower and candy bars and stealing
kisses with GIs.</TE>
<TE>   Younger generations, for which the war is only an echo, are more
suspicious of the U.S., admiring its capitalist vigor and democratic
principles, but critical of its unilateralist tendencies. And those
who grew up under communism in the East have the least affinity for
Washington and its enormous power.</TE>
<TE>   All agree that the once-cozy German-American relationship has
evolved into something more complex. Common bonds and friendship will
remain, they say, but the days of the reassuring crackle of Armed
Forces Radio and the euphoria over a toppled communist empire have
faded against a more fragmented and confusing world of terrorism,
regional hostilities and wobbly stock markets.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a real purpose for our relationship with the U.S.: We
were scared of the Soviets," said Bernd Kaehne, a bookseller at
Berlin's Humboldt University. "We don't glorify the U.S. so much
these days. We've become more critical. I don't think we'll ever be
as close as we once were. We don't need the protection."</TE>
<TE>   Checking her class schedule in the marble foyer at the university,
Katharina Rohts eased into flawless English, referring to President
Bush as G.W. and veering into the "philosophical differences" between
the U.S. and Germany. Her views reflect the findings of a recent poll
that 76% of Germans oppose sending troops to Iraq and 52% dislike
Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "These days, people in other countries feel America doesn't care
about them," she said. "So why should we care about America? We
always knew America had lots of military and economic power.... With
President Clinton, you got the feeling Washington was at least
listening. Things have changed with Bush.... I hope this is a step of
German independence from the U.S."</TE>
<TE>   Johannes Schueler is a tad more diplomatic.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up in the East, so I always heard about how unilateralist
the U.S. was and how it looted from the Third World," said the
freshman information technologies student. "I can see today that the
U.S. acts in its own interests. I like America. I've visited twice.
But sometimes it acts without weighing the consequences."</TE>
<TE>   "I've been racking my brain over why people hate America so much,"
said Rene Hausler, an undergrad with a Walkman and a denim jacket,
who, like most Germans, is a committed pacifist. "I think the U.S. is
putting too much money into its war machine."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the courtyards of Humboldt, around the corner from where
the Nazis torched books in the 1930s, Ilse Modersohn and her
daughter, Helke, strolled arm in arm through the Gendarmenmarkt
square. A child of World War II, Ilse scattered pigeons with her
cane, and Helke patted her mother's sleeve in the late-morning sun.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think things have changed between the U.S. and Germany,"
Helke said.</TE>
<TE>   "Only a few are speaking badly," Ilse said.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are a little cool between us now, but we're friends."</TE>
<TE>   "It's only because of Iraq. We've had enough war."</TE>
<TE>   "We must stand together."</TE>
<TE>   "Yes."</TE>
<TE>   Ilse stopped on the cobblestones and smiled.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember how the Americans helped us in West Berlin," she said.
"We were an island, and the Americans came."</TE>
<TE>   Mother and daughter headed toward a row of linden trees and into a
snarl of tourist bus traffic.</TE>
<TE>   The bankers and lawyers were on lunch break at Friedrichstadt
Mall. There was goose liver and wurst, espresso and swirls of
cigarette smoke.</TE>
<TE>   Heinz Pieske was killing time, window-shopping at a crystal shop.
He was old and happy for distraction. He spoke of war, of being
scared, of his adventure to the hills of Tennessee. He traced the
path that an American paratrooper's bullet had traveled many years
ago: in the shoulder, along the rib cage.</TE>
<TE>   There are scars.</TE>
<TE>   "Germany was bad off before the war," he said. "You can't imagine
what Hitler did to us. I think now Germany and the U.S. will stay
close. Nobody can afford anything else."</TE>

<HD>Davis Appointees Give $12 Million to Campaign</HD>
<DH>More than 240 of those he named to boards are donors, but
aides say there is no quid pro quo.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Morain</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Nearly one-fifth of the $64 million Gov. Gray Davis has raised for
his reelection, about $12 million, has been directed to his campaign
by people he appointed to state boards and commissions.</LD>
<LD>   Among those who contributed are multimillionaires on the
University of California Board of Regents, racing enthusiasts on the
California Horse Racing Board, and union leaders whose organizations
have donated more than $4 million.</LD>
<LD>   At least 75 of the roughly 140 boards that have statewide
authority include at least one Davis donor. Many have a majority who
are contributors and some are filled exclusively with political
donors, according to a Times analysis of campaign finance records.</LD>
<TE>   Davis' aides say there is no connection between campaign donations
and appointments. Others, including some Davis appointees, say giving
him money helps draw attention to them and their desire to receive a
coveted board seat.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're someone who has been financially supportive," said Norm
Pattiz, named to the Board of Regents last October, "they know who
you are. It's that simple."</TE>
<TE>   More than 240 Davis appointees have donated to him directly or
through spouses, close business associates or corporate or union
employers. In several cases, appointees have given him money within
weeks or days of their receiving their posts. In some cases,
donations were reported on the day Davis announced the appointments.</TE>
<TE>   "It shouldn't come as a surprise that people who are active in
politics are going to want to serve on boards and commissions," said
Davis campaign spokesman Roger Salazar, who also has worked in the
governor's press office. But he called it "putting the cart before
the horse to say the reason they get these appointments is because
they are active."</TE>
<TE>   "I know the governor doesn't give extra weight to that," Salazar
said. He dismissed questions about the timing of campaign checks and
appointments: "It's making a connection that doesn't exist."</TE>
<TE>   Although governors typically have in mind some supporters they
want to name to sought-after boards and commissions, by far the bulk
of those slots are filled by people who submit applications. Davis'
appointments secretary, Los Angeles lawyer Michael Yamaki, vets the
applicants, doing background checks and interviewing them.</TE>
<TE>   He said his goal is to select people who will follow Davis'
policies, work hard and not embarrass the administration. Yamaki, a
former Los Angeles police commissioner, helped Davis raise money in
his 1998 election campaign.</TE>
<TE>   His predecessor, Assemblyman Dario Frommer (D-Los Feliz), was
political director of the 1998 campaign. But though they know Davis
donors, Yamaki said he never asks prospective appointees about
political support.</TE>
<TE>   There are two types of boards and commissions to which Davis makes
appointments. The most prestigious are 79 panels whose members
require confirmation by the state Senate. Of the nearly 600 vacancies
on those boards, at least 100 of Davis' appointees have donated to
his campaign -- for a combined $9.5 million since 1999 either
directly or through spouses, employers or unions. Donors serve on at
least 50 of the 79 boards.</TE>
<TE>   The second type of board requires no legislative confirmation.
Fewer of the more than 2,000 appointees to those panels are donors.
But Davis has collected from appointees to a variety of those boards
and commissions, including some of the roughly 500 people who serve
on California's 54 county fair boards -- accounting for nearly $2.5
million in all.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the appointees get little or no pay. But the slots give
commissioners prestige within their fields and avocations.</TE>
<TE>   Part-time board members help oversee state agencies and
departments. Many cast votes affecting how tax money gets spent. Some
decide which companies are awarded state contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of commissions that oversee professions ranging from real
estate and accounting to podiatry and medicine wield the power to
revoke licenses of wayward practitioners.</TE>
<TE>   "It's dynamite," said Hollywood nightclub owner Gene La Pietra, a
former parks commissioner who gave $80,000 to the governor this year
and who is the leading proponent of Hollywood secession.</TE>
<TE>   "You get access," La Pietra added. "You get things done. It picks
you up a bit. It is a prestige booster, no question. It's nice to be
the commissioner. I love it."</TE>
<TE>   There is no overall estimate of the amounts given to past
governors by their appointees. But judging by his choices for the UC
Board of Regents, Davis has received far more from his appointees
than previous governors received.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Pete Wilson's regents donated $138,700 in his first term. The
money came from six of the 13 people he nominated for the board.
Davis' appointees to the regents have donated nearly 10 times that
sum: $1.3 million during his first term, either directly or through
companies with which they are affiliated.</TE>
<TE>   Seven of Davis' nine regents are donors. They include Richard
Blum, husband of Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). Blum has given
Davis $50,600 and has helped raise roughly $200,000 more. Regent Haim
Saban, an entertainment mogul, has donated $500,000 to Davis directly
or through companies he controls. Saban also made a $7-million
donation this year to the Democratic National Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Does being a contributor help secure such appointments?</TE>
<TE>   "Sure. Of course it does," Pattiz said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Pattiz isn't a college graduate, he brings more than
money to the Board of Regents. He's founder of the radio network
Westwood One, and has a long-standing interest in education. He is
the main benefactor of Hamilton High School Academy of Music in Los
Angeles, is a past president of the Broadcasting Education Assn., and
served on a board that oversees UCLA's communications program.</TE>
<TE>   A Davis supporter since early in the governor's political career,
Pattiz has donated $120,000 to his reelection since 1999. When Davis
was elected, Pattiz hoped for an opportunity to serve in some
capacity and "give back" to the state where he made his fortune, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   A review of Davis' appointments during his first term shows:</TE>
<TE>   * Six of eight named to the California State University Board of
Trustees have donated $631,600 to his reelection since 1999.
Appointees include a union leader, the head of a statewide business
lobby group, the son of a major Sacramento-area developer, and
Shailesh Mehta, past chairman of Providian Financial Corp., one of
the largest credit card issuers to people with shaky credit.</TE>
<TE>   * Five of Davis' eight appointees to the State Board of Education,
which sets policy for public schools, have donated $1.05 million
altogether since 1999. Board Chairman Reed Hastings, head of the
movie rental firm Netflix, has given Davis $350,000, and estimates
that he has helped raise a similar amount from others.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems natural that people who have the means and faith in the
governor would contribute," Hastings said, adding that he donates to
Davis because the governor supports expansion of charter public
schools. He said there was "no expectation" that he needed to donate
to get the appointment.</TE>
<TE>   * Four of five current Parks and Recreation Commission members are
donors, including Davis' most famous appointee, actor Clint Eastwood,
who held a fund-raiser for the governor this year. Current and past
commissioners have given Davis at least $386,000.</TE>
<TE>   * All Davis' appointees to the Contractors State License Board,
except the one who by law must be a local building official, have
donated to Davis' reelection. Either directly or through their
organizations, they've given him $100,000. Members of several other
professional boards, ranging from physicians to architects and
accountants, also are donors.</TE>
<TE>   * Horse racing board members have given Davis a relatively modest
$62,000. Vice Chairman Roger Licht, for one, has donated $1,000. But
Licht, a Beverly Hills lawyer, is a business associate of one of
Davis' major benefactors, Martin J. Wygod. Wygod and his wife,
Pamela, are horse breeders, and have given Davis $279,000 since 1999.
Wygod said he recommended Licht to the administration.</TE>
<TE>   Board member William Bianco, a Republican who has given Davis no
money, is a partner with David Shimmon in Fog City Stables, which
owns and breeds thoroughbred race horses. Shimmon has donated
$450,000 to Davis since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're a donor," Bianco said, "they ask for
recommendations."</TE>
<TE>   * Six of eight California Transportation Commission members, who
help oversee how billions are spent on transit projects, have donated
$685,000 to Davis directly or through their unions. A seventh helped
ensure that the California Trucking Assn. endorsed Davis when the
commissioner was president of the group in 1998. The trucking group
has given Davis $136,000 since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The board includes San Francisco lawyer Jeremiah Hallisey, whose
firm has given $61,750 to the governor, modest by Davis' standards.
But Hallisey leverages his clout by organizing fund-raisers for the
governor.</TE>
<TE>   Davis aides often turn to Hallisey for recommendations about other
potential appointees to boards and commissions. Hallisey has ready
access to the governor's staff on behalf of such clients as Pacific
Lumber Co., energy firm Calpine and AT&amp;T.</TE>
<TE>   Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr., trying to
unseat Davis in next month's election, seized on the connection
between campaign donations and appointees last month when Rod
Diridon, the Davis-appointed chairman of California's High Speed Rail
Commission, sent an e-mail to firms that would "build, operate and
maintain" a $25-billion bullet train system urging that they attend a
fund-raiser in Davis' honor.</TE>
<TE>   As head of the rail commission, Diridon will have at least some
sway over the proposed massive public works undertaking. Davis
canceled the event after news reports that the fund-raiser would take
place a day after the governor, with Diridon at his side, signed
legislation placing a $9.9-billion bond issue on the 2004 statewide
ballot to help finance the bullet train.</TE>
<TE>   Simon called the circumstances "unethical and beneath the dignity
of the office of governor of California."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Davis fired an aide for accepting $25,000 on
the governor's behalf from a lobbyist for Oracle Corp., days after
the administration signed a software contract with Oracle. At the
time, Davis released an internal policy that bars aides from
political fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   Salazar, the Davis campaign spokesman, said the prohibition
applies only to paid full-time aides such as his Cabinet officers,
agency chiefs and department directors -- not appointees who serve
part time in largely unpaid positions.</TE>
<TE>   "People have a constitutional right to participate in the civic
process," Salazar said. "This is all line-drawing. It gets into the
touchy issue of how far can you go without violating constitutional
rights."</TE>
<TE>   Some say Davis partisans broach the issue of campaign support with
prospective appointees, but never bluntly.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to get on the Fish and Game Commission?" asked retired
state Court of Appeal Justice William Newsom. "You'd better be
prepared to raise $100,000. They never say it directly. They're much
too sophisticated. It's elliptical."</TE>
<TE>   Newsom has known Davis since their days in Gov. Jerry Brown's
administration. He helped Davis raise money during the 1998 campaign,
and wanted a spot on the Fish and Game board. After his election,
Davis named Newsom to the Parks and Recreation Commission. But there
were so many vacancies that there was no quorum to hold a meeting. As
Newsom saw it, the job was little more than "window dressing."</TE>
<TE>   Newsom's term was supposed to expire as Davis headed into his
reelection campaign. The reason, Newsom surmised, was that Davis
hoped Newsom would raise additional money for the governor's
reelection to secure reappointment. Rather than raise money, Newsom
quit.</TE>
<TE>   Some Davis appointees who have given no money provide other
benefits. Former Clinton administration official Bob Hattoy, for
example, recently was named to the Fish and Game Commission. A past
Sierra Club regional director, Hattoy campaigned successfully last
month to secure the organization's endorsement for Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Other notable appointees who have given no money include Dee Dee
Myers, a state university trustee who served as press secretary to
President Clinton. Myers recently moved back to Washington, D.C., and
plans to give up the post after the election. UC Regent Monica
Lozano, president and chief operating officer of the Spanish-language
newspaper La Opinion, also has given no money.</TE>
<TE>   Appointees, particularly those from organized labor, have a
variety of reasons for donating to the Democratic governor. Many
unions have fared well during Davis' first term, winning his support
on various workplace and pay issues.</TE>
<TE>   "Labor deserves to have people on these commissions and to have a
voice," said James Kellogg, the top executive in the state's plumbers
union and a Davis appointee to the Fish and Game Commission. Like
other labor leaders, Kellogg said, he had little access during the 16
years when Republican Govs. Wilson and George Deukmejian were in
charge.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm proud that [Davis] considers me to be a good enough friend
and supporter to place me on any commission," he said.</TE>

<HD>An Army of Police Hunts Elusive Prey</HD>
<DH>A sniper picks his lone quarry, fires from as far as 500
yards away, then vanishes into a crowd.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephen Braun, Lisa Getter and Mark Fineman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>No one has reported seeing the Washington Beltway killer in lethal
action. No one can be certain of seeing him flee. He is more hunter
than sniper, investigators say, a proficient rifleman intimate with
suburban Washington's nimbus of highways and malls. He picks out his
lone quarry, fires from as far as 500 yards away, then vanishes on
planned escape routes.</LD>
<LD>   For 10 days, as the gunman stalked 10 victims in a metropolis of 5
million people, killing eight and wounding two, an unprecedented army
of 200 detectives bolstered by hundreds of local patrol officers and
federal agents has fanned out through Washington's panicked suburbs.
Northern Virginia authorities said Saturday that ballistic tests
confirmed that Friday's victim also was killed by the same sniper.
Kenneth H. Bridges, a 53-year-old Philadelphia businessman, was
felled by a distant shot at a gas station just off the highway near
Fredericksburg.</LD>
<TE>   Investigators have amassed evidence from dozens of witnesses,
sifted through nearly 10,000 tips, logged thousands of hours and
hundreds of thousands of dollars in overtime pay -- all in the futile
search for a human cipher. In suburban Montgomery County, Md., where
five victims were slain in a 16-hour spree 10 days ago, teams of
detectives have spent hours pulling stacks of purchase orders and
registration records at gun shops, trying to find a paper trail on
the killer.</TE>
<TE>   For all police know, there is so much more they do not. Except for
several spent shells and bullet fragments and a cryptic calling card
apparently left by the killer at one shooting site, physical evidence
is meager.</TE>
<TE>   Victims seem chosen by opportunity, not by design -- shrouding the
killer's motives. And stunned witnesses have offered a chaotic fog of
observations, forcing hesitant investigators to operate mostly on
theories, uncertain even whether they are pursuing one or two
suspects.</TE>
<TE>   "He chooses his victims with no discernible motive other than the
kill," said a senior law enforcement official working with the task
force. "This is what hunters do."</TE>
<TE>   The card was drawn from a Tarot deck embossed with the skeletal
symbol of death. A message scrawled on it, "Dear Mr. Policeman, I am
God," has been analyzed by experts who conclude that it came from the
gunman.</TE>
<TE>   But beyond the spectral card left near the Prince George's County,
Md., schoolyard where a 13-year-old was wounded, police have almost
none of the crucial physical evidence -- license tags, receipts,
clothing -- they desperately need to zero in on the killer's
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "He's basically turning the region into his personal shooting
gallery," said James Alan Fox, an analyst of serial murders and a
professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University in Boston.
"And he's enjoying it."</TE>
<TE>   Although investigators have spent recent days interviewing scores
of Virginia motel guests in Manassas and Four Mile Fork on the
possibility that the killer may have been a transient who rented a
room, officials suspect the killer is more likely a Montgomery County
resident with business or relatives in Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   "A spree like this usually starts in a community they know," one
official said. "The small circumference" of the initial killings
suggests the sniper lives somewhere in Maryland, the official said,
then shifted to Virginia when police activity threatened his ability
to move about freely.</TE>
<TE>   Still, investigators have tried to take care not to narrow their
focus. On Friday, hours after Bridges was killed, deputies detained
Hobert Epps, 36, an Athens, Ga., man who wandered up to the yellow
crowd control tape separating police from news crews.</TE>
<TE>   Epps, a ruddy, barrel-chested man with a thick mustache, said he
was searched, then taken to a motel room where investigators grilled
him about his interest in the case. "They told me I fit the profile"
of a suspect in the case, Epps said.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Epps said, police scrutinized his face, comparing it
with a small, grainy photograph that appeared to have been magnified
from a video camera. After several minutes, Epps said, he was freed.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia authorities declined to say whether police were using any
photos of suspects in the killing spree. But other officials said
that local detectives and federal agents have been reviewing hours of
video surveillance tapes shot from cameras overlooking crime scenes
in Maryland and Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   Late Saturday, the police task force released its first sketch of
the elusive white box truck spotted more than a week ago by witnesses
at suburban Maryland murder scenes. A similar sketch was also being
readied showing a second white Chevrolet Astro van reported in the
vicinity of the Friday slaying.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope it will help people and prompt their memory," said
Montgomery County Police Chief Charles A. Moose, who heads the
massive police team. Moose said several witnesses spotted the white
box truck 10 days ago at "more than one location" in Maryland. There
were other indications that the truck, with its distinctive dented
bumper and un-deciphered lettering, had been spotted at three
homicide sites.</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, veteran FBI and federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms profilers have amassed detailed psychological and
geographical portraits of the murderer and the patterns of the
killing spree. But those portraits may have been redrawn in recent
days as the killer shifted his pattern of attack.</TE>
<TE>   Although Moose has declined to discuss the profilers' work, he
urged residents Saturday to report anyone "not at work during the
incident," keeping haphazard schedules or displaying "some sort of
anger toward police." One official said that sort of profile might
fit a mobile contractor, such as a plumber or electrician, who uses a
van or truck to circle the far-flung Beltway and its byways.</TE>
<TE>   After an initial daring strike through the heart of suburban
Montgomery County, squeezing off solitary rifle shots that killed
five victims around the heavily traveled Connecticut Avenue corridor,
the killer suddenly altered his tactics. Since Wednesday, he has
killed two men at remote Virginia highway interchanges -- an apparent
response, one official said, to the growing police presence on the
Maryland side and also to detailed media accounts of his exploits.</TE>
<TE>   "He's random and methodical at the same time," said Montgomery
County State's Atty. Douglas F. Gansler, who heads a team of
prosecutors working on the first five Maryland killings.</TE>
<TE>   But by choosing a disparate range of victims -- black, white and
Asian, teenage and middle-age -- the killer sends no discernible hint
of motive. "Nobody really knows what's spurring him to do this,"
Gansler said.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia authorities seemed to back away late Friday from their
earlier emphasis on the white van, conceding that witnesses only saw
a vehicle driving away from the shooting scene, uncertain whether it
was involved in the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   But federal law enforcement sources said Saturday that witnesses
from several of the sniper's killing grounds have reported to
investigators that they saw a white van weaving through traffic at
the exact moment shots were fired. In other cases, such as the
shooting at the middle school in Prince George's County, Md., the
gunman apparently staked out a prone position in the woods, firing
from behind dense foliage.</TE>
<TE>   If shots were fired from a moving vehicle, officials said, that
might indicate not only that the shooter is adept, but also may have
an accomplice driver.</TE>
<TE>   A federal official said Saturday that teams of investigators are
looking into three distinct theories about who their suspect might
be. The suspect could be a solitary middle-age white male. He could
also be a team of two, either dark-skinned Latinos or Middle
Easterners, according to some witness accounts. And there are some
witness reports suggesting that a male and female team drove off in
the truck.</TE>
<TE>   Police have not discussed those theories openly. But in one media
interview last week, Gary M. Bald, an FBI agent from Baltimore who is
coordinating the bureau's involvement, acknowledged that
investigators had information concerning the ethnicity and other
details of those being sought.</TE>
<TE>   But the wide variation in operating theories indicates the
difficulty that witnesses have had in scanning a crime scene moments
after hearing the crack of a gunshot and then providing reliable
reports to police.</TE>
<TE>   "The average suburban person has never heard a gunshot," said
Harry Geehreng, a former Montgomery County police sergeant. "Unless
they're in the police business or have some kind of training, they
think it's a backfire or noise from a construction site. Their first
focus is on the victim, not the killer, and by the time they look
around, the suspect is probably long gone."</TE>
<TE>   There have also been internal debates within the task force about
the killer's proficiency with his rifle. Officials said federal
investigators have pored over military records, even seeking help
from Pentagon officials in searching for records of former military
snipers and crack marksmen for possible suspects.</TE>
<TE>   But investigators and former police weapons experts have concluded
that the killer's level of expertise does not indicate high-level
military weapons training. Instead, they believe he is either a
hunter or someone who has taken enough rifle training to show limited
proficiency -- and may be using a telescopic sight and a brace to
steady his aim.</TE>
<TE>   "He's hitting his target, but the targets are not that difficult
to hit," said Stuart A. Meyers, a former Montgomery County police
assault team sniper who now works as a weapons trainer. "With some
basic training and aids like scopes, these are not impossible feats."</TE>
<TE>   The gunman, said one official, has been firing from as close as
150 yards and perhaps as far as 500 yards. In at least two killings,
investigators are uncertain where the shooter fired from.</TE>
<TE>   "That makes for an enormous expansion of these crime scenes," the
official said. That explains why police have cordoned off stretches
of streets and raked over motel balconies, lots and shrubbery
hundreds of yards from the killing zones.</TE>
<TE>   ATF agents have used metal detectors and dogs capable of sensing
the trace presence of firearms. On Friday, several of the animals,
transported from the agency's canine unit in Front Royal, Va.,
foraged through a grassy area no more than 50 yards from where
Bridges fell. But even as they did, FBI agents across a remote
stretch of U.S. 1 went door to door in several motels, questioning
guests.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives already have canvassed area gun shops in Maryland, a
move Virginia authorities are now expanding in their own
jurisdictions after last week's sniper killings in Prince William and
Spotsylvania counties.</TE>
<TE>   As early as 10 days ago, hours after the fifth Maryland victim,
Lori Ann Lewis-Rivera, 25, was shot dead at a Shell station,
Montgomery County detectives swept into gun stores, poring through
registration records and sales receipts.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted to know if anyone had bought a large amount of
ammunition at one time," said Hank Posner, manager of Gilbert Guns in
Rockville. Detectives homed in on records showing that one customer
recently bought 10 boxes -- more than 200 rounds -- of .223-caliber
ammo. But several days later, police told Posner the patron had a
legitimate explanation.</TE>
<TE>   In the days since, several dozen Maryland gun shops have been
searched. Virginia arms dealers said late Friday they soon expected a
wave of visits from local investigators in the wake of the latest
service station killings.</TE>
<TE>   But despite the urge to check any lead, Meyers said gun record
searches would have limited value. "This is not a unique weapons
system he's probably using," he said. "Too many people use that
ammunition and the guns that fire them."</TE>
<TE>   There are at least half a dozen varieties of weapons that fire the
popular .223 rounds. One federal firearms investigator cited the
AR-15, the semiautomatic civilian version of the fully automatic M-16
military rifle, as the most likely weapon used by the killer.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland and Virginia prosecutors have sent top assistants out to
crime scenes with investigators after each new incident. After the
Prince William slaying, the county's prosecutor said he would press
for the death penalty if the sniper is captured. Although Maryland
Gov. Parris Glendening has imposed a temporary moratorium on
executions, Gansler -- the Montgomery County state's attorney -- said
that would not prevent him from also seeking to try the killings in
his county as capital cases.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have researched the legal ramifications of some of the
police team's rapid moves. Before police moved to search white box
trucks across the region's roads, prosecutors had to "figure out if
we could stop any white box truck out there," Gansler said. Lawyers
concluded that the extraordinary civic peril justified the move.</TE>
<TE>   Former police officials and task force officials say the team is
pressing every available resource.</TE>
<TE>   On the one hand, the involvement of federal authorities has given
the task force the ability to use the FBI's advanced computerized
collating of informant tips, detailed geographical plotting of the
killer's patterns and rapid ATF testing of bullet fragments.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, other officials say, local police chiefs are
pressing patrol officers at daily roll calls to stay alert for the
routine police work that could break the case.</TE>
<TE>   In Montgomery County, the area's 1,000-officer department is
"already responding on the patrol level," former police sergeant
Geehreng said.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen them stopping white trucks all over the place."</TE>
<TE>   That attention to detail has sometimes led investigators to
retrace each other's tracks. But even the attendant chaos sometimes
yields small victories.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, three hours after Bridges fell mortally wounded at the
Exxon pump bay in Four Mile Fork, an ATF agent burst into a Waffle
House down the hill from the murder scene.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia troopers and sheriff's deputies already had been through
the restaurant several times, questioning waitresses, cooks and
patrons. But the ATF agent persisted.</TE>
<TE>   "Is there anybody who was here this morning who hasn't been
interviewed yet?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   When he noticed a waitress grimace, he motioned her to follow him
behind a closed pantry door.</TE>
<TE>   He left five minutes later, clutching an investigator's notebook
containing several newly filled pages.</TE>

<HD>Prime Time for the WB Network</HD>
<DH>Born in 1995, now the youngster is catching up with rival
broadcasters and drawing the attention of audiences and advertisers
alike</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Meg James</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 8-year-old WB network is, like, growing up.</LD>
<LD>   Ratings for the young network are rising by nearly 20%. Such hit
shows as "Smallville," "Dawson's Creek," and "Gilmore Girls" have
helped the WB for the first time beat its entrenched elders -- NBC,
CBS, ABC and Fox -- among viewers aged 18 to 34 on some nights.</LD>
<LD>   Madison Avenue advertisers, who covet that free-spending
demographic, seem to be developing a crush on the WB. For the fall
season, the WB commanded the highest ad rate increases--more than
15%--of any broadcast network.</LD>
<TE>   That may be money well spent. This year's premieres--from the WB's
bedrock "7th Heaven" to its flashy new "Birds of Prey" -- are drawing
record audiences, a fact that has not gone unnoticed.</TE>
<TE>   "The WB is off to a terrific start," acknowledged Jeff Zucker,
NBC's president of entertainment. "They deserve a lot of credit for
putting together a terrific schedule."</TE>
<TE>   The WB isn't setting out to be a mini-NBC or one of the other Big
Boys of the airwaves. The network has no news, no sports, no
late-night shows and no stations of its own. It's sticking to a game
plan that has led to the growth spurt: to be a destination network
for teens, young women and, increasingly, for men.</TE>
<TE>   After seven years and roughly $700 million in losses, analysts say
black ink is in sight. They predict that the WB's projected $800
million in revenue for the season will cover operating and
programming costs, and that the network will have positive cash flow
by early next year.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Weisel Partners media analyst Gordon Hodge said the
network's advantage is its ability to deliver a concentrated group of
young, impressionable viewers to advertisers.</TE>
<TE>   "Teens and people in their early 20s, at that time of their lives,
are making all sorts of branding decisions," Hodge said. "They're
going to college, buying soap and other products for the first time
and thinking about what cars to buy."</TE>
<TE>   The network is three-quarters owned by AOL Time Warner Inc. and
the rest is held by Tribune Co., which also publishes the Los Angeles
Times.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner executives say the WB is a bright light within the
struggling conglomerate's far-flung media empire. Wall Street
analysts say the network has given Warner Bros. Television studios a
platform for first-run programming and syndication profits. WB shows
occasionally feature songs and artists from the Warner Music Group
label. In addition, analysts say, the network has enhanced the value
of the 17 Tribune-owned stations that carry WB programming.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not every day that you create a successful broadcast network
in America," said Jeffrey Bewkes, chairman of AOL Time Warner's
Entertainment and Networks Group. "It has essentially done what it
set out to do."</TE>
<TE>   A significant part of that success has been the network's quick
reflexes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Confident Decisions</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, former NBC Entertainment President Warren Littlefield
and two other producers headed to the WB's Burbank headquarters -- a
cluster of portable buildings on a Warner Bros. back lot -- to pitch
a comedy about a 34-year-old man who suddenly returns to the age of
14. Before Littlefield could even leave the parking lot, WB execs
were on his cell phone ordering scripts and a pilot for the show, "Do
Over."</TE>
<TE>   "This network knows who they are, and who they want to be and they
act on it," Littlefield said. "The notion is long gone that a single
network can be an end-all, be-all to everyone. NBC kind of gave up on
younger families. ABC stopped running their TGI Friday family
line-up. And the WB was intelligent enough to march right in and say
we're happy to take their audience."</TE>
<TE>   Nine years ago, the WB had just five employees.</TE>
<TE>   The first was Jamie Kellner, a key architect of the Fox network.
At a time when experts doubted there was room for another network,
Fox got a toehold with such irreverent and provocative offerings as
"The Simpsons" and "Melrose Place."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't long before Fox, as part of a strategy to become a major
broadcaster, stole the NFL from CBS. By then, Kellner had left Fox
but knew that there was room for yet another network to capitalize on
TV's shifting balance of power.</TE>
<TE>   Cable was filching viewers from the major networks with targeted
programming. In 1996, Washington relaxed regulations that had been
intended to force networks to buy programming from diverse sources.
Now, the networks were allowed to own more of their shows so they
could reap more money and better compete with cable outlets.</TE>
<TE>   Kellner's idea solved a problem for Warner Bros. Although the
studio was the largest producer of television programs, it had no
network for distribution. The content of Kellner's WB network would
be dictated by the country's changing demographics and the soft spots
of his competitors.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ready for the Boom</TE>
<TE>   Baby boomers had been busy having their own babies, creating a
huge bulge in population. The same children who made Walt Disney
Co.'s 1994 "Lion King" a mega-sensation would need something to watch
at home.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew there was going to be another echo boom," said Kellner,
chairman of Turner Broadcasting System. "Fox was vacating that spot,
and we knew that advertisers wanted those younger demographics and
would pay a lot of money for them."</TE>
<TE>   Since his new network did not have enough money to buy its own
stations, Kellner recruited some independents, teaming up with
Tribune. But Kellner, it turned out, was not the only one with an eye
on creating a fifth network.</TE>
<TE>   Before Kellner could unveil his venture, Paramount Television
Group and Chris-Craft Industries Inc. announced it had joined forces
to create the United Paramount Network. The war was on.</TE>
<TE>   On its side, UPN had the powerful "Star Trek" franchise. The WB
had Michigan J. Frog, a crooning vaudeville frog that had been in
Warner Bros.' cartoon vault since 1955. Executives of the WB, mostly
refugees from Fox, embraced the frog's quirky image. They had learned
the hard way that a network needed a distinct look and feel,
particularly after Fox had fumbled for a few years trying to
establish an identity amid its hodgepodge slate of shows.</TE>
<TE>   The network went on the air in January 1995. "Whatever came in the
door went on the air," recalled WB marketing co-president Bob Bibb,
one of the WB's original executives.</TE>
<TE>   But by the network's second full season, which began in the fall
of 1996, the WB had welcomed "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," "7th Heaven"
and the "Steve Harvey Show." They would become the network's first
signature shows--even though older advertising executives weren't
eager to sign on.</TE>
<TE>   Network President Jed Petrick, who was then head of ad sales, knew
how to get around the problem: He began throwing beer and pizza
parties to whip up enthusiasm among the advertising agencies' younger
buyers.</TE>
<TE>   The network's biggest programming challenge may have been the loss
of one of those early hits. When "Buffy" was up for renewal last
year, Twentieth Century Fox Television studios demanded $2.3 million
per episode to cover production costs. The WB refused to pay more
than $1.8 million. Rival UPN swooped in and paid the asking price.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of "Buffy" drove a stake into the WB's ratings with UPN
nudging ahead, finishing the season fifth among all viewers,
including the prized 18-to-34 age group. The WB responded by moving a
little noticed show into the critical Tuesday night slot to compete
head-on with Buffy.</TE>
<TE>   This season, "Gilmore Girls" has been trouncing Buffy, drawing
more than a million more viewers an episode. "Now we have a younger
show that is performing better and it costs less," boasted the
network's entertainment president, Jordan Levin, 35.</TE>
<TE>   The creator of "Gilmore Girls," Amy Sherman-Palladino, said she
didn't even bother pitching the show to the big networks. She had
been down that road as one of the original writers for NBC's
"Veronica's Closet" with Kirstie Alley, which survived just three
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   This time, she pitched several ideas to the WB. Her last
suggestion was just a throw-away line. "Maybe something about a
mother and daughter who are more like friends?"</TE>
<TE>   "We love it," she recalled the executives saying. "Let's do that
one!"</TE>
<TE>   "That was the first time in my life anything like that ever
happened," she said, contending that other networks probably would
have said: "And the mother's a cop, right? And she's fleeing from
someone and she's shooting a gun, right?"</TE>
<TE>   Although the network is enjoying its adolescent successes, it
still faces growing pains.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gaps in Distribution</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, the network is still trying to fill gaps in its
distribution. In the midsection of the country, the WB does not air
in some communities. Elsewhere, the network is hard to find because
it is not tied to strong stations with easy numbers. Instead, it is
lost in the clutter of cable channels.</TE>
<TE>   Media analyst Leland Westerfield said the WB also doesn't have the
leverage of other networks that offer a range of programming,
including sports. "They can't strong-arm advertisers," he said, by
squeezing them out of some categories.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts and network executives say that perhaps the biggest
question confronting the WB is how it can change its image as a
destination for girls and invite more boys and older viewers to the
party.</TE>
<TE>   That strategy is evident in shows such as "Everwood," which is
about a conflict between a father and his 15-year-old, and "Birds of
Prey," which features a superhero theme and attractive actresses.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate it when we're discounted as a teen network," said
marketing chief Bibb. "But teens are very important, they set new
trends.... We love teens because when they fall in love with
something, they really fall in love."</TE>

<HD>Donations Dried Up With Tech Stocks</HD>
<DH>As Nasdaq declined, so too did the grand charitable
ambitions of onetime billionaires.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Streitfeld</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the end of the last century, during that unimaginably distant time
when Nasdaq was stair-stepping its way to the heavens, a new age of
philanthropy was declared.</LD>
<LD>   Driven by motives as varied as peer pressure, egotism and a
sincere desire to help others, technology executives made great gifts
to higher education. They established private foundations. They
funded pet causes and devised charitable projects.</LD>
<LD>   The remarkable thing wasn't just the amounts of money being
committed, although they could be jaw-dropping. It was the scale of
the ambitions.</LD>
<TE>   "After the so-called failures of the Great Society programs in the
1960s, there was a wariness about trying to tackle big issues," said
Steven Lawrence, research director for the Foundation Center. "In the
1990s, you finally had people willing to conceive of attacking
intractable problems."</TE>
<TE>   One new billionaire said he was setting up an online university
that would offer a free "Ivy League quality" education to anyone.
Another announced his goal of preventing damage to the water, air and
land. A third said he was pledging $100 million to fulfill a vision
of "children in Africa asleep in safe shelters, alert in their
classrooms, with hope and joy in their eyes, replacing the pain and
confusion."</TE>
<TE>   Although many heroic ventures were announced and some even
achieved, many have been shelved or quietly abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   "The so-called New Renaissance of Giving was as real as Internet
stocks," said Steve Kirsch, a Silicon Valley philanthropist who has
seen the value of his foundation fall to $15 million from $70
million. "I don't think anyone's trying to pretend they're doing
great things."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Saylor's online university was one of the most-hyped
philanthropic declarations of the boom, making headlines around the
country in March 2000. The founder of MicroStrategy Inc., a Virginia
software company, Saylor offered a remarkably detailed account of his
plans. He had put up $100 million for his "cyber-Library of
Congress," he said. He would be hiring curriculum experts, writers,
editors, technicians. In the next few months, lectures by the world's
"geniuses and leaders" would be taped. In the next few weeks, Saylor
told the Washington Post, he would announce endorsements "from
senators, Cabinet-level people, well-known educators."</TE>
<TE>   It was all so believable. And why not? MicroStrategy was valued at
$25 billion and Saylor owned half of it. The money had come very
fast, most of it as MicroStrategy stock soared in the previous year.
Saylor was well-known for being impatient. He would make it happen.</TE>
<TE>   Since Saylor's splashy announcement, however, there has been
silence. MicroStrategy has crashed, along with Saylor's personal
wealth. The stock market value of the company is $94 million, less
than the donation he said he made to his foundation.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of 2000, tax records show, Saylor's private foundation
was worth $15 million. It's unclear what, if any, toll the subsequent
decline in the stock market has taken on that sum.</TE>
<TE>   Saylor declined to be interviewed about his foundation or the
university.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not something he likes to talk about," said MicroStrategy
spokesman Marc Brailov. "When he announced it, our stock was over
$300 and the economy was going robustly. Now it's a much more
challenging environment. His focus is on his business."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cutting-Edge Research</TE>
<TE>   Nanovation Technologies Inc. also was keen on higher education,
but made its contribution in a more traditional way.</TE>
<TE>   In January 2000, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
announced that the Michigan company was donating $90 million to fund
a "cutting-edge research facility" in photonic, microphotonic and
nanophotonic devices. Photonic technologies enhance and speed up data
transmission, offering a significant building block for super-fast
Internet connections.</TE>
<TE>   Only $4 million of the pledge was paid, an MIT spokesman said.
Nanovation filed for bankruptcy protection a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Other foundations are no longer stressing the size of their asset
base. Instead, they're emphasizing the quality of their projects.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Berber founded online broker CyBerCorp, which was acquired
by Charles Schwab Corp. for $488 million in March 2000. Shortly
afterward, Berber and his wife, Donna, started A Glimmer of Hope,
described on its Web site as "a global foundation that seeks to
relieve some of the pain and suffering on the planet," particularly
in rural Ethiopia. A news release on the site dated August 2000 says
it was started with a pledge of $100 million from the Berbers.</TE>
<TE>   It was an exceedingly generous gesture by a couple with an
ambitious, even noble, idea. But its latest IRS tax return, from
2000, says that contributions to the foundation that year totaled not
$100 million but $108,500.</TE>
<TE>   "How we arrived at that number, I don't even remember," said
Michael O'Keefe, the foundation's communications director. "The $100
million was a pledge. How much was paid in, I don't know. My
paychecks clear, and that's all I can tell you with regard to
finances."</TE>
<TE>   In any case, O'Keefe said, all mentions of the $100 million are
being purged from the Web site. "That was attracting all the
attention. We want the focus to be on what we're doing, which is an
even bigger deal," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the large foundations begun with technology money, the Bill
and Melinda Gates Foundation is an exception. It has held on to its
value--$24 billion at last report.</TE>
<TE>   Others have not fared nearly as well. The David and Lucille
Packard Foundation awarded $616 million in grants in 2000, making it
the largest benefactor in Silicon Valley. Stung by the decline in its
core holding, computer company Hewlett-Packard Co., the grants will
fall to $250 million this year and to $200 million next year.</TE>
<TE>   The Turner Foundation, started by AOL Time Warner Inc.'s vice
chairman, Ted Turner, had been making grants to hundreds of
environmental groups. Last year, the foundation paid out $70 million,
leaving it with only $148 million in assets.</TE>
<TE>   Ted Turner's wealth is tied up in AOL stock, which has declined
precipitously. With his ability to replenish the coffers diminished,
the foundation recently said it would not accept new funding requests
next year and in 2004 the grant process would be "by invitation
only."</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Turner grabbed headlines by making an impetuous gift of
$1 billion, payable over 10 years, to the United Nations. "I came up
with the idea on the spur of the moment," he said in a 2000 interview
with Modern Maturity. "It was a third of everything I had at the
time."</TE>
<TE>   To date, $373 million has been paid, which means Turner is more
than $200 million behind schedule.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation says Turner is not behind because of a decision
this summer to extend the life of the charity beyond the initial 10
years and spread his $1 billion over a longer, yet-to-be-determined,
time span.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Projects Scaled Back</TE>
<TE>   His other large pledge also is in arrears. When the Nuclear Threat
Initiative was set up in January 2001 to eradicate weapons of mass
destruction around the globe, Turner committed $50 million a year for
five years.</TE>
<TE>   Payments so far have totaled $26 million. Given the decline in AOL
stock, NTI says, it would be "inefficient" to ask Turner to sell more
now. As a result, the organization said, it is funding only "the most
urgent and time-sensitive projects," including "facilitating the
elimination of highly enriched uranium at nuclear power and research
reactors in Kazakhstan."</TE>
<TE>   NTI declined to discuss Turner's gift beyond its statement. No one
wants to blame a philanthropist for being over-generous, least of all
those who were counting on a share of it.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, it's almost impossible to renege on a pledge.</TE>
<TE>   "You know how a loan shark threatens to break your legs if you
don't pay up right now?" says one university fund-raiser. "Well,
we're exactly the opposite. We say, 'Oh, you can't do it in five
years? Take 10.' Even if you're broke, we just pretend someday we're
going to get the money."</TE>
<TE>   At a September conference of Ivy League fund-raisers, reports one
attendant, the talk was that "at every university, major pledge gifts
were being lengthened."</TE>
<TE>   Stanford University is in such a position with several major
donors, said Tim Portwood, director of university campaigns. MIT,
which like Stanford has been the recipient of much tech largess, was
even more discreet. Asked about a number of high-profile benefactors,
the school said only that they were all "loyal supporters of our
efforts."</TE>
<TE>   During the boom years, no one was so shy. Perhaps partly as the
result of media questions about whether fabulously wealthy Silicon
Valley was generous enough, some of the new rich were quick to talk
about sharing their windfalls.</TE>
<TE>   From 1991 to 1999, the number of active private and community
foundations in California increased to 4,208 from 2,702. In 2000,
powered by the New Economy, the total jumped to 4,948.</TE>
<TE>   It was downright fashionable to have a foundation. "Some part of
the growth in the 1990s was because of people saying, 'Oh, so-and-so
has a foundation now, why don't I?' " said Lawrence of the Foundation
Center.</TE>
<TE>   Family foundations allowed entrepreneurs to lavish money and,
almost as important, the resulting publicity on cherished causes.
Katrina Garnett, founder of CrossWorlds Software and one of the few
prominent women in Silicon Valley, started the Garnett Family
Foundation to encourage young women to pursue computer science
careers.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, the foundation sponsored a weeklong computer camp at
Stanford for high school girls. "There's no reason we can't go
national eventually," Garnett said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   But by 2000, her interests seemed elsewhere. The foundation paid
$11,659 in consulting fees that year, according to tax records, but
the only disbursement listed was $3,332 to the San Jose Tech Museum.
Garnett didn't respond to an e-mail, but an associate confirmed that
the foundation is being shut down.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Checks Have Stopped</TE>
<TE>   The Garnett Foundation at least got off the ground. Steve Toben of
the Flora Family Foundation remembers one family, whose net worth had
risen from $500,000 to $100 million almost instantly, thanks to their
software company. The family members were soliciting Toben for advice
when the slide began.</TE>
<TE>   Before they could decide what kind of foundation they wanted,
their net worth was back to $500,000--not even enough to buy a house
in Silicon Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "The money came very quickly in Silicon Valley, and it often
disappeared just as quickly," Toben said. "There's a sustained
interest in social ventures, but people have stopped writing the
checks."</TE>
<TE>   During the boom, Silicon Valley became a laboratory for
more-innovative forms of philanthropy. The Entrepreneurs Foundation
was designed to help start-ups develop charitable programs. In
return, they would give a tiny slice of their stock to the
foundation. If only a few of the companies went public and turned
into the next EBay or Yahoo, the resulting war chest would fund many
programs.</TE>
<TE>   But of 93 companies that gave the foundation stock, 18 have died,
more have merged and some are "inactive," Entrepreneurs Foundation
President Steve Scheier said. "We're not paying a great deal of
attention to our list of stocks now."</TE>
<TE>   At Cisco Systems Inc., so many millionaires were being created
that the company invented the position of "giving counselor" to help
them deal with it. The position was created two years ago just as
Cisco stock began tumbling from $60 a share to $15.</TE>
<TE>   The counselor's role has broadened into areas such as
volunteerism, spokeswoman Tae Yoo said. "Before, you had money but no
time. Now you have no money, so you can eke out time to do volunteer
work."</TE>
<TE>   When the United Way of Santa Clara County, in the heart of Silicon
Valley, declared an $11-million shortfall in 1999, Steve Kirsch,
founder of Internet search company Infoseek, asked, "How many
millionaires came forward?" Two, he answered: himself and Intel Corp.
co-founder Gordon Moore.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those interviewed were much more upbeat, displaying the
perennial hopefulness of Silicon Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "The residual effect of the boom years has been a much heightened
consciousness about social responsibility," said the Flora
Foundation's Toben. "They caught the bug. We're going through a bad
hit now, but the bug will persist."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I am not a smoker, and I do believe that the tobacco companies have
misled the public as to the true dangers of cigarettes for many years
["Philip Morris Ordered to Pay $28 Billion to Smoker," Oct. 5].</LD>
<LD>   However, that said, what human being living in the United States
in the last 40 years has not been bombarded with public service
announcements, ads and medical evidence warning of the dangers of
cigarette smoking?</LD>
<LD>   Twenty-eight billion dollars for a single smoker? When exactly is
enough enough? I'm sure attorney Michael Piuze must be very proud of
his victory over the goliath Philip Morris. I look at him as simply
another reason for tort reform in this country.</LD>
<TE>   Will Ray</TE>
<TE>   Burbank</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit by Betty Bullock against Philip Morris and the spate
of other lawsuits against the tobacco industry is a microcosm of what
is wrong with our legal system and society at large.</TE>
<TE>   The current social climate and the "devil made me do it" legal
philosophy are behind this idea that smokers are victims and someone
needs to be punished.</TE>
<TE>   All you need is 12 dimwitted jurors to fall for your victimization
sob story, and you win the lawsuit lottery. The truth be damned. Just
because 12 jurors say that the moon is made of green cheese doesn't
make it true.</TE>
<TE>   For the record, I have never smoked.</TE>

<HD>Feeling the Pain of Kaiser's Pressure</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I have read of Kaiser Permanente's concern about people and health
maintenance organizations ["Rising Costs Put Pressure on Kaiser,"
Sept. 29]. If Kaiser is so concerned on a moralistic and humanistic
level, how come it has discontinued service to me after 47 years of
membership?</LD>
<LD>   I realize that it's not just me but 2,500 to 2,800 elder citizens
in the Coachella Valley. I realize that Kaiser is a business just as
any other HMO, but it sends me messages about all the new building
and improvements it is doing and then accuses me of not being "cost
effective."</LD>
<LD>   I moved to the Coachella Valley because Kaiser assured me that I
would be covered. I realize that things change, but after continuous
raises to meet its needs, I am now "cost ineffective"?</LD>
<TE>   My whole medical history and associations have been with Kaiser.
Not only is it a pretense for Kaiser to say it cares, but it is a
shame. Surely something can be done to prevent such actions.</TE>
<TE>   Eleanor Hirsch</TE>
<TE>   Palm Desert</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If Kaiser is feeling the pressure of rising costs, imagine the
pressure being felt by older members on very fixed incomes who need
more care than younger members. In our youth-oriented society, one
would think that at least in the matter of health care, age wouldn't
be held against a person.</TE>
<TE>   The costs for special needs when older could be offset by all the
years of not needing much care.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser has been a wonderful leader in how an HMO should work. But
now its older members will be the payers. To younger members:
Remember that you too will age.</TE>
<TE>   Damiana Chavez</TE>

<HD>Dispute Shows a Union Firmly Anchored at West Coast Ports</HD>
<DH>The ILWU owes its staying power to its founders, who
ensured members' total control over the seaboard.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Cleeland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Along with enviable wages, generous pensions and work rules that hark
back to an earlier generation, members of the International Longshore
and Warehouse Union retain another relic of blue-collar America --
the proud swagger of being in charge.</LD>
<LD>   "Longies" have owned the West Coast waterfront for six decades,
through years that saw the U.S. labor movement grow strong and bold,
then fragmented and weak.</LD>
<LD>   The union represents just 10,500 dockworkers -- a fraction of its
peak membership and a tiny pool compared with the numbers of
unionized auto workers or machinists. Yet its power is gargantuan, as
demonstrated by the recent labor dispute that brought ports from San
Diego to Seattle to a standstill and drained billions of dollars from
the U.S. economy.</LD>
<TE>   Shipping company officials closed the ports for 10 days after
presenting evidence of union slowdowns that cut productivity 50%.
Under pressure from retailers and manufacturers, President Bush last
week invoked the rarely used Taft-Hartley Act to get the ports open
again.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the union's power comes from being dealt a good hand. The
union represents crane operators who move multi-ton containers off
ships and forklift drivers who stack the containers onto rail cars
and trucks.</TE>
<TE>   Those are skilled jobs that cannot be shipped to Third World
sweatshops, and they have become more important as the U.S. economy
goes global.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps more significant, however, are the foresight of the
union's founders, who ensured members' control of the Western
seaboard, and the pit-bull-like determination of their successors to
hold on to that legacy.</TE>
<TE>   Union leaders view their current contract battle with the shipping
industry as part of an old and justified struggle to retain the
jurisdiction and control that keep them strong. In this case, they
worry about holding on to jobs that could be chased off the docks by
computers and the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't have the jobs, you don't have the wages, you don't
have the benefits, you don't have the pensions and you don't have the
union to protect them," said union spokesman Steve Stallone.</TE>
<TE>   Once vulnerable day laborers, longies have become working-class
icons, earning wages that range from $28 to $40 an hour, with high
premiums for night or early shifts, for jobs that require no college
education. Salaries for veteran clerks and supervisors easily can top
$150,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rivals' Resentment</TE>
<TE>   Union leaders don't apologize for those high wages and benefits,
explaining that their perks were earned through a bargain made
decades ago, when employers offered to share the fruits of increased
production if the union would accept drastic job cuts that would come
with the implementation of contain shipping.</TE>
<TE>   They also note that most members earn their union cards by putting
in several years of apprentice-like "casual labor," a time of
unpredictable hours and no benefits.</TE>
<TE>   There is no question, however, that the ILWU's good fortune has
evoked envy and resentment. Members of rival unions, terminal
managers and truckers who move through the docks every day maintain
that the union's long success has bred a culture of entitlement and
greed.</TE>
<TE>   And they say that change, more than intransigent employers, could
be its undoing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really disappointing that collectively they don't see how
good they have it," said Jim, a payroll clerk at a Los Angeles
terminal who, like many union critics, said he feared repercussions
if he used his full name.</TE>
<TE>   "It's insanity down here," he said. "They work half the time of
most people and make twice the money and gripe about it all day. And
any loss, any concession -- it's like drawing blood from a stone."</TE>
<TE>   Such grumbling is nothing new, said David J. Olson, a political
science professor at the University of Washington who has made a
specialty of studying the ILWU.</TE>
<TE>   "People have been making the same kinds of charges for decades --
that the union is arrogant, strong-headed, too militant, too
possessive of the space it occupies on the docks," he said. "I see
greater consistency than differences here. It's been a fundamental
principle of the ILWU from its first breath that the union controls
the production process on the terminals. They see themselves as lords
of the docks."</TE>
<TE>   Nothing about the International Longshore and Warehouse Union can
be understood fully without a look at its history, particularly its
legendary founder, Harry Bridges.</TE>
<TE>   Bridges was a scrappy laborer from Australia who worked the San
Francisco docks when the job was demeaning, dangerous and barely
provided a living. In 1934 he became active in a series of violent
waterfront strikes and emerged as the leader of the union that was
born out of them. On July 5, during a dramatic confrontation between
striking longshore workers and police on San Francisco's Embarcadero,
two men were shot dead and 30 suffered gunshot wounds -- a day
remembered by longies ever since as Bloody Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Bridges realized that his fledgling labor group needed two things
to survive: a union-controlled hiring hall that would bypass corrupt
bosses on the docks and a bargaining unit that spanned the entire
coast so shipping companies couldn't play one port against the other.</TE>
<TE>   Those principles, maintained to this day, are at the root of the
union's success. A charismatic consensus builder who ran the union
until 1977, Bridges contributed one more keystone: the Modernization
and Mechanization Agreement of 1960. That contract, still viewed as a
model, embraced the new shipping mode of containerization on the
expectation that it would eliminate thousands of union jobs. Before
cargo was packed in containers, freight was packed piece by piece in
the ship's hold, a slow and labor-intensive process.</TE>
<TE>   In return for the union's acceptance of containers, employers
agreed to keep under union jurisdiction all cargo-handling jobs that
remained and to share the wealth created by the increased
productivity with union members.</TE>
<TE>   Harley Shaiken, a labor expert at UC Berkeley, said dockworkers on
the East Coast chose another strategy, fighting modernization in
small skirmishes and losing their power in pieces.</TE>
<TE>   Bridges' memory is honored by the union through the Harry Bridges
libraries it maintains at most major ports and the paid day off that
marks his birthday each year.</TE>
<TE>   He was equally admired by those who sat across from him at the
bargaining table. "Harry worked for my grandfather going into the '34
strike," said G. Scott Jones, a former Los Angeles terminal operator
and director of employer group the Pacific Maritime Assn. for 32
years.</TE>
<TE>   "When he finally got the union going he was a god, and justifiably
so," Jones said. "He was a very tough negotiator, but always with a
civility that you don't see today. And he enjoyed the full support of
the rank and file. That was very important."</TE>
<TE>   Bridges was succeeded in 1977 by his top lieutenant, Jimmy Herman,
who presided over the union for 14 years. Then began a series of
political coups that saw the union's leadership pass from San
Francisco to Southern California and change four times in a decade.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The union now is led by James J. Spinosa, who has taken the stance
that the union will continue to "work safe" -- the management group
says it's code for working slowly -- as the ports come back to life.</TE>
<TE>   All of Bridges' successors have felt increasing pressure to
deliver perks for his constituents, said Jones and other close
observers of the union. The shipping lines, in turn, gave in to most
demands, prizing peace at the docks over all else.</TE>
<TE>   After acceding to union demands in contract negotiations in 1996
and 1999, several shipping executives said, they had to draw the line
and fight for the introduction of labor-saving technology that would
enable the ports to run more efficiently.</TE>
<TE>   Union officials view the history differently. Though they
acknowledge cutthroat politics and high turnover at the national
level in the last decade, they see the real source of conflict in the
employers' group.</TE>
<TE>   Bent on breaking the union, they say, hard-line carriers and
terminal operators sought a new president of their own -- Joseph
Miniace -- who has not shied away from staring down a tough union at
the table.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Public Rancor</TE>
<TE>   By either account, the stage was set for confrontation on a grand
scale when contract negotiations began in May. Through nearly five
months of contentious negotiations, the rancor often broke into
public view.</TE>
<TE>   Then late last month, in response to what he said were union
slowdowns, Miniace ordered the first lockout of dockworkers on the
West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   With the intervention of President Bush, the ports are operating
again, at least for an 80-day cooling-off period supervised by a
federal judge.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations are expected to resume this week, and some observers
believe the two sides will reach an accommodation. With global trade
booming, there is too much at stake for both sides for the standoff
to continue.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the expectations are that both parties will come out of
this more than whole," said Ezunial Burts, executive director of the
Port of Los Angeles from 1984 to 1997. "Longshore members will make
more money and shipping lines will get more productivity.</TE>
<TE>   "There may be some hurt feelings and bruised egos, but the system
will continue pretty much as it has," Burts said. "When it's all
over, I guarantee, you won't hear people saying the longshore union
'used' to be powerful."</TE>

<HD>Finagling Medicaid Eligibility May Not Be the Best Strategy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Liz Pulliam Weston</AU>
<BD>Special To The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: My mother-in-law is quite elderly and her liquid assets are
almost gone. We've been advised that her house should be placed in a
trust, which would make her eligible for Medicaid. Would this
transaction be valid? The children are her beneficiaries and are
anxious to protect their inheritance.</LD>
<LD>   Answer: They are, are they? Are they at all anxious to do what's
best for their mother?</LD>
<LD>   The question must be asked when it comes to Medicaid, which is the
government medical program for the indigent. Medicare, the program
for people 65 and older, generally doesn't pay for nursing home care,
so some people try to artificially impoverish themselves or their
loved ones in order to qualify for Medicaid, which does pay for what
is called custodial care.</LD>
<TE>   Many people have an ethical problem with this kind of planning
because Medicaid was intended to aid the poor--not to protect
inheritances.</TE>
<TE>   There's a practical aspect to this issue as well. Simply put, your
mother probably will have more options and access to better care if
she pays for it herself. She may be able to do that, as well as boost
her monthly income, if you help her arrange a reverse mortgage on her
home. That would allow her to get a monthly check in exchange for
giving up some or all of the equity she has in her house. It would
mean a smaller inheritance for her children, but could mean a better
quality of life for her.</TE>
<TE>   As for the trust, that may work to help her qualify for Medicaid
if it's constructed correctly. It also may be unnecessary, because if
she has few other assets, she may qualify for Medicaid already.</TE>
<TE>   All these are issues that she and her children need to discuss
with an attorney who specializes in elder law. The National Academy
of Elder Law Attorneys at www.naela.org can offer referrals. If it
turns out that what's best for Mom and what's best for the kids'
pocketbooks are in alignment, that's great. If not, let's hope
concern for Mom wins out.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Going by the Numbers: Boost Your FICO Score</TE>
<TE>   Q: I've read your advice about the importance of checking your
three-digit FICO credit score, as well as your credit report, before
applying for a mortgage. You mentioned the site www.myfico.com. But
did you know that when you pay $12.95 for a credit score from MyFico,
you're given only one of the scores that are given to lenders -- the
highest one? Lenders typically use a median or average of all three
to make a decision on a mortgage. This can be devastating if you
thought you had a better score (in my case, a high score slightly
above 700), but the lenders give you a higher interest rate because
your median score was actually below 700. The problem in my mind is
that MyFico makes no mention of the fact that you will get only one
of the scores -- and not the right one -- when it charges you $12.95
for the information.</TE>
<TE>   A: You're right that the score provided by MyFico, a joint venture
of credit bureau Equifax and credit scoring firm Fair Isaac, is only
one of the three FICO scores lenders may pull when they're evaluating
a mortgage.</TE>
<TE>   But the MyFico score is not necessarily the highest.</TE>
<TE>   The MyFico.com service gives you your FICO score based on your
credit report at Equifax. Your score may be different at Experian and
TransUnion. Although all three use the basic FICO formula developed
by Fair Isaac, each score is based on information the individual
credit bureau has on file about you. Equifax may include some
accounts that Experian lacks, for example, and vice versa. Rarely
does one person have exactly the same credit report at all three
bureaus. This isn't surprising, given that all three are private
companies that compete with each other for information. Your score
also can change over time as new information is added or errors are
deleted.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of the source, however, more than half of Americans
have credit scores above 720 -- a level that generally qualifies them
for the best rates lenders have to offer. Their credit is good enough
that variations in the three bureaus' scores are likely to be minor
and probably won't hurt them that much.</TE>
<TE>   When a score is borderline, as yours was, it can pay to work on
improving it before you apply for a loan. Start by checking your
credit report at all three bureaus and correcting any errors. If you
have accounts with a long, positive history -- you've had the credit
for many years and made every payment on time -- you can ask the
creditor to report it to any bureau that's missing that information.</TE>
<TE>   Other steps to take to improve your score include reducing credit
card debt. Make sure, too, to pay all your bills on time, every time,
because prompt payments can help restore damaged credit while late
payments can devastate it.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever you do, don't close any accounts while you're trying to
boost your score. Despite what some ill-informed loan officers or
mortgage brokers may tell you, closing accounts can't help your
score, and may hurt it.</TE>

<HD>For Many, the Bull May Arrive Too Late</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Tom Petruno</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nature of severe bear markets is that, by the time they're done,
there isn't an investor left who hasn't been deeply humbled --
including those who, near the end, come to believe the bear will
reign forever.</LD>
<LD>   Early last week, when the headlines noted that the market's losses
had reached the worst levels of any decline since the late-1930s,
some analysts dutifully trotted out new "how low can it go" numbers
for the Dow Jones industrial average. Would 6,000 do it? Maybe 5,000?
One estimate came in at 777, with a forecast for an accompanying U.S.
economic depression.</LD>
<LD>   That was all it took for the market to demonstrate, once again,
that it has no intention of being so predictable. From its five-year
low of 7,286.27 on Wednesday, the Dow zoomed 247.68 points on
Thursday and 316.34 points on Friday, for a two-day surge of 7.7%.</LD>
<TE>   To put that gain in perspective, it's equivalent to the interest
income a 10-year Treasury note will pay over two years.</TE>
<TE>   But it will take a lot more rallies like those to put a stake in
the heart of this bear. And for many investors and companies, it may
be too late. Some significant, if unmeasurable, portion of the
psychological and financial damage that has been done now is
irreversible.</TE>
<TE>   Many individual stocks have been reduced to virtual irrelevance,
their prices so low that they might as well be lottery tickets: You
figure they'll either pay off in a big way, or, more likely, you'll
just throw them away.</TE>
<TE>   This had been the story of technology and telecom, but it has now
become a market-wide phenomenon. AMR Corp., the parent of American
Airlines, closed at $3.70 a share on Friday. Calpine Corp., which
owns and operates electric power plants in 23 states, trades at $2.49
a share. Ford Motor Co. fell as low as $6.90 last week before clawing
back to $8.32 by Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I've ever seen this many companies" at these price
levels, said David Dreman, head of Dreman Value Management in Jersey
City, N.J., and a veteran "value"-style investor.</TE>
<TE>   In the Nasdaq market alone, 60% of the 3,800 listed stocks now
trade below $5 a share, Nasdaq Chairman Hardwick Simmons lamented
last week at the Security Traders Assn. annual meeting in Boca Raton,
Fla. About 500 Nasdaq shares are under $1, he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Iffy Fundamentals</TE>
<TE>   Serious investors know, of course, it isn't the nominal dollar
value of a stock that counts. It's what is behind that price in terms
of assets, earnings power and other fundamental measures.</TE>
<TE>   But when shares of once highly regarded firms fall into or near
penny-stock range, the fundamentals can become unreliable. People are
forced to question what they thought they knew about a company.</TE>
<TE>   That is true in part because a low share price can destroy a
firm's chances of getting the financing it needs to operate its
business. The market's verdict on a company, as reflected in its
stock, can become self-fulfilling.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's fairly safe to say that most of these stocks under
$5 aren't going to come back," Dreman said.</TE>
<TE>   But he said he also is reminded of the story of famed investor Sir
John Templeton. "When war began in Europe in 1939, [Templeton]
borrowed money to buy 100 shares in each of 104 companies selling at
$1 a share or less, including 34 companies that were in bankruptcy,"
according to the John Templeton Foundation's Web site. It was the
beginning of an investing career that eventually would place
Templeton in the pantheon of the world's top stock pickers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Some Will Win Big</TE>
<TE>   Unquestionably, some investors are going to reap big profits
buying depressed stocks this time around, too. In a decline as brutal
as this one has been, with the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index still down
45% from its March 2000 peak, it's inconceivable that every stock
sale of the last two years has been well-informed.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, some investors will be shown to have sold stocks
too low, just as others bought stocks too high in the madness of the
bull market.</TE>
<TE>   But identifying long-term winners among beaten-down stocks,
especially those that trade in single digits, looks simple only after
the fact. Even if the bear market is ending -- a big if, with war
looming and the global economy struggling -- the issue is what kind
of market will follow.</TE>
<TE>   Most investors probably would prefer a new bull run in which
prices rise at a steady pace, perhaps 10% a year, on average. And
precisely because that's what most people might want, the market is
unlikely to be so accommodating.</TE>
<TE>   Many single-digit stocks that now arguably are undervalued could
quickly snap back to levels at which they would be fairly valued or
even overvalued. The rebounds could occur too fast for most investors
to get on board -- shades of the technology rally of late last year.</TE>
<TE>   At best, the stocks might then become dead money for a long time.
That was the experience of many blue-chip shares in the late 1970s,
after the market rocketed in 1975 following the 1973-74 decline.</TE>
<TE>   At worst, sharp rebounds in low-priced shares could rapidly give
way to renewed declines, as companies' fundamentals deteriorate.
Shareholders of Lucent Technologies Inc. know how that feels. Despite
four rallies this year that were significant in percentage terms,
Lucent stock has continued to slide. It closed at a record low of 58
cents on Friday after the firm warned of another quarterly loss.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the biggest question facing the market overall is whether
many potential long-term investors have simply tuned it out,
permanently. That is often the legacy of devastating market declines:
People stop caring about stocks altogether.</TE>
<TE>   When apathy is widespread, it can leave the market largely in the
hands of traders. That, in turn, can make for plenty of excitement
day to day, but it isn't a prescription for a lasting new bull
market.</TE>

<LD>Wall Street Breaks Its Losing Streak</LD>
<LD>   A big surge Thursday and Friday allowed Wall Street to break its
six-week losing streak.</LD>
<LD>   The two-day rally pushed the Dow industrials up 7.7%, erasing
earlier losses and giving the Dow a 4.3% gain for the week. The rally
also lifted the benchmark Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, which on
Monday brought the loss from its March 2000 peak to 48.6%--the
deepest bear market since the Great Depression.</LD>
<TE>   Stocks rallied despite tepid economic news and a mixed bag of
corporate profit reports, as well as continuing worries over war with
Iraq. Analysts were cautious about predicting whether the rally would
continue into this week, when earnings reporting season begins in
earnest.</TE>

<TE>   Bush Wins Injunction Ending Port Lockout</TE>
<TE>   President Bush won an emergency injunction to end the 10-day
lockout at 29 West Coast ports that had inflicted billions of dollars
in damage.</TE>
<TE>   Using his authority under the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act, Bush
requested the emergency order after a White House panel informed him
that "seeds of distrust" had so poisoned relations between shipping
lines and dockworkers that the two sides were unlikely to reach an
agreement on their own.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge William Alsup this week will consider
extending his temporary order, which would mandate an 80-day
cooling-off period retroactive to Oct. 8.</TE>
<TE>   The injunction allowed billions of dollars' worth of cargo that
had piled up at the ports during the shutdown to start moving into
supply chains.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, representatives of the International Longshore and
Warehouse Union and the Pacific Maritime Assn. employer group said
they expected negotiations with a federal mediator to resume this
week.</TE>

<TE>   Senate Panel Says SEC Missed Enron Signs</TE>
<TE>   A Senate panel investigating Enron Corp.'s collapse said the
Securities and Exchange Commission missed early signs of financial
abuses at the energy giant, raising questions about whether the
agency is "effectively functioning as the lead market watchdog that
it is meant to be."</TE>
<TE>   The probe by the Governmental Affairs Committee found a "systemic
and catastrophic failure" by those charged with protecting investors
-- including stock analysts, credit rating firms and the SEC,
according to the committee's report.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's financial collapse and filing for bankruptcy protection,
which followed disclosures that it used off-the-books partnerships to
hide debt, spawned a frenzy of congressional hearings, contributed to
passage of sweeping accounting reforms and led this month to the
arrest of Andrew S. Fastow, the company's former chief financial
officer, on charges of fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the harshest criticism was directed at the SEC, whose
chairman, Harvey L. Pitt, has been accused of not being aggressive
enough in rooting out corporate wrongdoing -- although many of the
shortcomings highlighted in the committee's report date to before
Pitt took over as chairman in August 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Democratic congressional leaders called on President
Bush to remove Pitt, whom they accuse of opposing a tough candidate
to head a new oversight board at the accounting industry's behest.
Bush continues to stand by him.</TE>

<TE>   FCC Blocks EchoStar's Buyout of DirecTV</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Communications Commission blocked EchoStar
Communications Corp.'s proposed $16-billion buyout of satellite
television rival DirecTV, declaring the harm to consumers would be
"staggering."</TE>
<TE>   The FCC's four commissioners brushed aside EchoStar's last-minute
offer to amend the merger and decided that a combination of the
nation's No. 1 and No. 2 satellite television companies would stifle
competition and innovation, lead to higher prices for consumers and
hurt the quality of service.</TE>
<TE>   "The combination of Echo- Star and DirecTV would have us replace a
vibrant competitive market with a regulated monopoly," FCC Chairman
Michael K. Powell said. "This flies in the face of three decades of
communications policy."</TE>
<TE>   The decision marks the first time since 1967 that the FCC has
voted to halt a major merger.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said it sets the stage for a potentially massive legal
battle, either between the government and the two companies, or
between the two companies themselves, fighting over who is to blame
for the merger's collapse.</TE>

<TE>   Brazilian Markets Reel as Leftist Wins Vote</TE>
<TE>   A leftist candidate's victory in the first round of Brazil's
presidential election sent local markets reeling amid deepening
pessimism over whether Latin America's biggest country can avert a
debt default and economic implosion that could spill into neighboring
countries.</TE>
<TE>   Workers' Party candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva took 46.4% of
the vote, short of the 50% needed to win outright but enough to make
his ascension to the presidency a virtual certainty after an Oct. 27
runoff.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil's currency and main stock index, the Bovespa, hit
three-year lows.</TE>
<TE>   Worries about a Lula victory have been weighing on markets since
the spring. Throughout his campaign, he has remained vague about
whether he would renegotiate Brazil's $260-billion public debt load
and dismantle the free-market economic scheme implemented by current
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso.</TE>

<TE>   Blue Cross Plans to Rate More Physicians</TE>
<TE>   Blue Cross of California, one of the nation's largest health
insurers, said it would begin keeping a quality scorecard on
thousands of physicians and pay bonuses to those who meet high
standards of care.</TE>
<TE>   The incentive program is part of a growing movement nationally to
hold health providers more accountable for the quality as well as the
cost of care. In recent years, almost all of the quality focus has
been on HMOs.</TE>
<TE>   The program will apply to many of the 43,000 California physicians
in Blue Cross' preferred provider organization, or PPO, which has
more than 4 million members.</TE>

<TE>   Two Americans Win Nobel in Economics</TE>
<TE>   Two American academics won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic
Sciences for applying psychology and experimental research to such
conundrums as why stock markets form "bubbles" and why people think
they can sell an item for more money than they will pay to buy it.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Kahneman, 68, a psychology professor at Princeton
University, and Vernon L. Smith, 75, a professor of economics and law
at George Mason University in Virginia, will share the $1.1 million
that goes with the prize.</TE>
<TE>   Each man's work represents a distinct challenge to classical
economic theory, in which individuals always act rationally and there
always is a single price on which buyers and sellers can agree.</TE>
<TE>   Receiving the Nobel Prize for medicine was MIT scientist H. Robert
Horvitz, co-founder of Idun Pharmaceuticals, a small San Diego
company that has an exclusive license on his discoveries, including
his Nobel-worthy work on the "cell death" gene.</TE>

<TE>   Cadiz Water Storage Project Canceled</TE>
<TE>   The board of the Metropolitan Water District voted to abandon a
project by Cadiz Inc. to build a multimillion-dollar water storage
facility in the Mojave Desert.</TE>
<TE>   The MWD cited, among other concerns, the Santa Monica-based
company's questionable financial strength and doubts that the
district could be adequately protected against the possibility of a
Cadiz default on its joint obligations.</TE>
<TE>   Cadiz suggested that the MWD may have violated its contract with
the company by killing the project before formally reviewing its
environmental impact report. It was not known what action the company
would take, if any.</TE>
<TE>   The project's demise places the company under a financial strain
that raises the question of whether it can survive. The project was
to generate an estimated $500 million to $1 billion in revenue for
the company over the next 50 years.</TE>

<TE>   Former Executive With Ovitz Files Lawsuit</TE>
<TE>   Onetime super-agent Michael Ovitz is being sued again by a former
top executive.</TE>
<TE>   Cathy Schulman, the former president of Ovitz's film production
division at now-defunct Artists Management Group, said in court
papers that her former boss flew into a "rage" and fired her for
telling auditors that she suspected Ovitz of "improperly allocating"
film company funds.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit, which seeks more than $4 million in damages for
wrongful termination and breach of contract, also accuses Ovitz of
denying her producing credits and fees.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court comes
nearly six months after Ovitz was sued by the former president of his
television division.</TE>

<LD>Again, Troy Glaus came through when it counted for the Angels. With
no score in the seventh, he singled to left to knock in the Angels'
first run, putting a dent in Brad Radke's armor. His hit opened the
floodgates, as the Angels scored twice in the seventh and five more
times in the eighth.</LD>

<LD>   Before this series began, many people claimed the Twins' bullpen
was as good, if not better, than the Angels'. Well, the collapses in
Games 3 and 4 put an end to those beliefs in a hurry, as Twin fans
must be wondering if any reliever on their team can get an out.</LD>

given up only six hits and one walk while striking out 10. His
earned-run average is 0.00. He struggled down the stretch during the

<TE>   Francisco Rodriguez is becoming one of the Angels' first real cult
heroes. The fans come to their feet when he pitches. Finally, the
Angels have found someone who might rival "Fernandomania" and
"Nomomania" in popularity. The fact he has struck out seven of the 13
Twins he has faced doesn't hurt.</TE>

<LD>Billy McMullen ran for the go-ahead touchdown and Matt Schaub threw
for another score as Virginia rallied to beat Clemson, 22-17,
Saturday at Charlottesville, Va.</LD>
<LD>   The Cavaliers, 5-2 and 3-1 in the Atlantic Coast Conference, won
their fifth consecutive game and again did their best work in the
second half, outscoring the Tigers, 16-7. They have outscored
opponents, 140-70, after halftime this season.</LD>
<LD>   Clemson (3-3, 1-2) started the game with a 19-play, 93-yard drive
that ended with a field goal, but managed only one more meaningful
score and hurt itschances with two turnovers late in the fourth
quarter.</LD>
<TE>   A seven-play, 92-yard drive, capped by Charlie Whitehurt's 10-yard
touchdown pass to J.J. McKelvey, gave Clemson hope with 1 minute 31
seconds remaining, but Virginia recovered the onside kick and ran out
the clock.</TE>
<TE>   No. 14 North Carolina State 34, North Carolina 17 -- Freshman T.A.
McLendon, playing with a cast on his broken right wrist, ran for a
season-high 164 yards and two touchdowns to help the Wolfpack (7-0,

<TE>   Wake Forest 36, Duke 10 -- The Demon Deacons (4-3, 2-2) scored on

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>It's the little guys who get you in October. They come from nowhere,
twist a series and then return to anonymity.</LD>
<LD>   St. Louis Manager Tony La Russa is still trying to figure out the
names of the Dodgers who beat his Oakland A's in the 1988 World
Series, but he had a couple of sudden superstars of his own right
down the bench from him on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   On a sunny Bay Area afternoon that featured impressive aerial
displays by Barry Bonds and the Blue Angels, Eli Marrero and Mike
Matheny topped them all. As a result, the Cardinals turned the rest
of the National League championship series into a contest, not a
formality.</LD>
<TE>   The Cardinals pulled to within two games to one with a 5-4 victory
over the San Francisco Giants, avoiding a 3-0 hole with postseason
specialist Livan Hernandez on the mound for the Giants in Game 4
today.</TE>
<TE>   In case you missed it, that's Eli Marrero and Mike Matheny. Two
guys who batted in the spots before the pitcher at the bottom of the
lineup. All-time playoff home runs between them before Game 3: zero.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Marrero had only one hit in 21 postseason at-bats before
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Marrero at least showed some long ball potential this year with 18
home runs. Matheny had only three homers, none since April 26.</TE>
<TE>   They're the St. Louis heroes of the moment. The guys who provided
an unexpected early run, and the guys who got the Cardinals back on
their feet after Bonds delivered a tying, water-splashing,
pompom-waving home run.</TE>
<TE>   In the first two innings, when the Cardinals had all kinds of
defensive mistakes, with second baseman Fernando Vina doing
everything he could to undermine their cause, the Giants brought only
one of their first eight baserunners home.</TE>
<TE>   But the Cardinals got their first run from Chuck Finley, who
reached base after swinging at a wild pitch that got away from
Giants' catcher Benito Santiago on strike three. Matheny gave them a
3-1 lead with a home run over Bonds in left field in the top of the
fourth.</TE>
<TE>   "I never think 'home run,' " Matheny said. "Obviously, with the
three that I had this year, it's not a whole lot.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to put up good at-bats. This time of the year, I
think if we go out there and really grind every pitch ... either
you're going to have a good at-bat or fight off some pitches and
hopefully wear down their staff and get something to fall in. I was
trying to do the same thing, have a good at-bat, trying to battle and
take what he would give me."</TE>
<TE>   Finley pulled an Indiana Jones-type escape in the bottom of the
second inning. He faced Bonds with the bases loaded. The Giants
already had one run in. Nothing to do but pitch to him. Is there a
worse predicament in sports?</TE>
<TE>   Somehow Finley managed to get Bonds to fly out to shallow right
field.</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't so lucky the next time Bonds came to the plate.</TE>
<TE>   And the Giants benefited from something that tops even the Rally
Monkey. If you think the little simian is cool, try a squadron of
F-18s.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Angels were in town for an air show this week, and they
made a few fly-bys over Pacific Bell Park on Saturday afternoon. They
soared over the stadium in their diamond formation before the bottom
of the fifth inning, when the Giants came to bat trailing, 4-1. Rich
Aurilia walked, Jeff Kent singled and then Bonds launched a shot into
McCovey Cove that had the 42,177 fans standing and waving their
orange pompoms.</TE>
<TE>   Believe in the power of the Rally Jets. Can the Dodgers get these
guys? Didn't the Blue Angels make an appearance in a Van Halen video
a few years back? That means they must have some free time, right?</TE>
<TE>   Bonds seems intent on wiping out all of his previous playoff
failures this year. He came through in Game 5 of the Atlanta series,
and his triple in Game 1 of this series helped launch the Giants' hit
parade. When he tied the score in Game 3 it was one of those great
baseball moments, when performance meets expectations, the big payoff
for all the buildup.</TE>
<TE>   Then a guy like Eli Marrero comes along and erases it.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds keeps company in the record books with the likes of Hank
Aaron, Babe Ruth and Willie Mays, the only players with more home
runs. The only way Marrero will get mentioned in the same sentence
with those legends is if he breaks into the Hall of Fame and steals
their plaques.</TE>
<TE>   He stole Bonds' moment Saturday. Helped pilfer a game, too.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd love to put a zero up after we tied the game, but it didn't
happen today," Aurilia said.</TE>
<TE>   What happened is the same thing that happens every October.</TE>
<TE>   The little guy had his day.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL NOTES/ AMERICAN LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES</KH>
<HD>Molina Delights in a Rare Triple</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>--Bill Shaikin, Mike Hiserman and Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Angel catcher Bengie Molina feared he wasn't contributing to the
team's success. "I haven't been swinging the bat the past month. Or
the season, really," he said.</LD>
<LD>   He made up for that in the eighth inning Saturday off Minnesota
reliever Mike Jackson. He drove a fastball to right-center to score
the final two runs of the Angels' 7-1 rout of the Twins, putting them
in position to win the best-of-seven American League championship
series today at Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   "I think I'm not going to go to sleep," an excited Molina said
after his third career triple and first since 2000.</LD>
<TE>   But he's probably tired enough after his baserunning exploits to
nap for a while.</TE>
<TE>   "I was running out of gas and almost stopped at second," he said,
"and when I got to third, Ronnie [Roenicke, the Angels' third base
coach] was saying something that I couldn't understand. I was trying
to say something, but I couldn't talk."</TE>
<TE>   His teammates kidded him heartily when the five-run inning ended.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to believe," Scott Spiezio said, shaking his head. "I
got credit for a stolen base -- stealing home too [in Game 2] and now
this."</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Darin Erstad was equally incredulous. "I don't know
what he had for breakfast," Erstad said "He actually ran pretty well.
I'm just glad he didn't pass out when he got to third."</TE>
<TE>   Said Manager Mike Scioscia: "Triples and Bengie Molina are like
going 60 mph on the Hollywood Freeway. It doesn't happen too often."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angel designated hitter Brad Fullmer, hit by dehydration and
cramping during the late innings Saturday, required a 30-minute
treatment of intravenous fluids after the game.</TE>
<TE>   After the treatment, Fullmer said he felt fine, and athletic
trainer Ned Bergert said Fullmer would be available to play today.</TE>
<TE>   Fullmer said he felt dizzy while standing on second base after he
doubled during the Angels' five-run eighth inning, but he wasn't sure
whether the dizziness was caused by the dehydration, the loud crowd
or both.</TE>
<TE>   "There was so much noise it was making my head ring," he said. "It
was unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If the series returns to Minnesota, the Angels are leaning toward
starting Ramon Ortiz in Game 6 and Jarrod Washburn, if necessary, in
Game 7. The Angels had considered starting Washburn on three days'
rest in Game 6, but Ortiz pitched a terrific game in the Metrodome
last Wednesday, and that would leave Washburn available to start the
deciding game of this series on regular rest--or to start Game 1 of
the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   California Gov. Gray Davis attended Saturday's game, joining
Disney Chairman Michael Eisner in a private suite. Davis must have
been thrilled to look up in the third inning and see an airplane
towing an advertising banner that read: "Vote Bill Simon for
Governor! Go Angels!"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Before the series, Angel closer Troy Percival asked Minnesota
closer Eddie Guardado to meet him on neutral ground -- the laundry
room between the teams' clubhouses -- to do him a favor.</TE>
<TE>   Percival collects baseballs autographed by fellow closers of the
past and present, and he wanted to add Guardado's signature to his
collection. The Minnesota lefty obliged.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been doing it for a while," said Percival, who counts
autographs of Lee Smith, Trevor Hoffman and Orlando Hernandez among
his keepsakes.</TE>
<TE>   Given his success, collectors should be asking for his autograph.
They do, "on and off," Percival said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have scored 10 of their 15 runs in this series in the
sixth inning or later. In the last two games, they scored eight of
their nine runs in the seventh inning or later.... Angel center
fielder Erstad was concerned for a moment he might have hurt himself
on his futile dive to catch Doug Mientkiewicz's leadoff double in the
eighth. However, he said later he was fine. "I think I rolled on the
ball," he said. "It was not my shoulder, thankfully." ... Angel
rookie Francisco Rodriguez has 13 strikeouts in 9 1/3 innings in the
playoffs, setting a single-season record for most strikeouts by a
reliever in postseason play.</TE>

<KH>AMERICAN LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES GAME 4/ ANGELS 7,
MINNESOTA 1</KH>
<HD>At Heaven's Gate</HD>
<DH>Anaheim takes 3-1 series lead to move tantalizingly close
to its first World Series</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels have wandered through the desert for more than four
decades, sometimes aimlessly and always fruitlessly, in search of the
promised land that is the World Series. Today, they stand before the
door to the promised land, armed with big red Thunder Sticks, ready
to pound that door down.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, they can: The Angels are one victory away from their first
trip to the World Series. These Angels are oblivious to the history
that says they can't and quietly aware of the magic that says they
can.</LD>
<LD>   In 1982, and again in 1986, the Angels had three chances to win
one game and advance to the World Series. They blew all three games
in '82, and again in '86.</LD>
<TE>   New team, new millennium. In a 7-1 victory over the Minnesota
Twins on Saturday, unlikely heroes sprouted all over the place.
Rookie John Lackey, who spent most of his youth as a first baseman,
pitched the game of his life, throwing seven shutout innings to
conquer Angel nemesis Brad Radke. Rookie Francisco Rodriguez, the kid
with lightning in his right arm, got his daily ration of two
strikeouts per inning.</TE>
<TE>   And the defining image of the series might be this: The Angels
scored their final two runs in the eighth inning, on a fly ball that
sent Gold Glove center fielder Torii Hunter into the fence and left
him rolling on the ground. All the while, Angel catcher Bengie
Molina, perhaps the slowest runner in the major leagues, huffed and
puffed his way to a triple.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't help but think everything is lining up," outfielder Tim
Salmon said.</TE>
<TE>   For six innings, the teams matched zeroes. Troy Glaus singled home
a run in the seventh inning, Scott Spiezio doubled home another, and
the Angels poured across five runs in the eighth. Suddenly, almost
too fast to believe, the Angels led the best-of-seven series, three
games to one.</TE>
<TE>   After 41 years of watching the World Series on television, and
after finishing 41 games out of first place last season, the Angels
are one victory from their third champagne bath in three weeks, one
victory away from the Fall Classic.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't really register," Salmon said. "It's not something
that seems real. The last 10 days to two weeks have been kind of
dream-like. You see so much emotion. You almost need an off-season to
make sense of it."</TE>
<TE>   If the Angels win today, the Twins' offseason starts tonight. If
not, the series returns to the Metrodome.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to go back to Minnesota," second baseman Adam
Kennedy said. "They want to get us on their turf. Their crowd wants
to get after us. We want to put a stop to it here."</TE>
<TE>   Said Hunter: "We've got to hope we have three games left. We have
to come out fighting."</TE>
<TE>   But the Twins played their ace -- Radke -- on Saturday, and they
lost. Lackey pitched seven innings and gave up three hits--all
singles--and no walks. He struck out seven, and the Twins never got a
runner past first base against him.</TE>
<TE>   Had he ever pitched a better game?</TE>
<TE>   "Not in the big leagues," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The tension mounted with each inning, with each zero posted by
Lackey and Radke. One big hit -- or one bad pitch -- could decide the
game.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm surprised I have nails left," Angel pitcher Jarrod Washburn
said. "My hands were sweating like crazy in the dugout."</TE>
<TE>   In describing the feeling that the game could turn on the next
pitch, every pitch, Glaus coined a new word.</TE>
<TE>   "That's fun," he said, "when every at-bat, every play, every
possible thing that could happen could be monstra-mental in the
outcome of the game."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels finally nicked Radke in the seventh, when Glaus singled
home Darin Erstad. They nicked him for another run in the seventh and
beat up the Minnesota bullpen in the eighth, and the edge-of-seat
tension that had filled Edison Field was rapidly replaced by an
eruption of joy and relentless noise.</TE>
<TE>   "This is awesome. The atmosphere is unbelievable," Angel reliever
Ben Weber said.</TE>
<TE>   "The atmosphere is better than Yankee Stadium, better than the
Metrodome. Our fans are louder. They're into it more."</TE>
<TE>   The final inning was nothing so much as a group therapy session
for the sellout crowd of 44,830. Everyone wore red, and banged sticks
that made loud noises, and hollered themselves hoarse, everyone
trying to exorcise four decades of frustration all at once.</TE>
<TE>   The fans remember 1986, and 1982, even if the players would rather
not be constantly reminded of their predecessors' failings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a different group of guys," Kennedy said. "We're trying to
make a little history of our own--in a positive way."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are one victory away from the World Series. The
pounding from those big red thunder sticks sounds awfully loud right
about now.</TE>

<KH>AMERICAN LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES</KH>
<HD>Erstad Is Leader on This Ship</HD>
<DH>Other players may get more attention, but Angel teammates
say center fielder is one they've looked to during postseason run.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The David Eckstein bandwagon gained passengers and momentum after the
Angels' division series win over the New York Yankees, with fans and
media members around the country beginning to notice the little
sparkplug of a shortstop and Manager Mike Scioscia touting him as a
most valuable player candidate.</LD>
<LD>   The recognition was well-deserved, but before the American League
championship series against the Minnesota Twins started last week,
Eckstein, almost embarrassed about all the attention, pulled a
reporter aside to set the record straight.</LD>
<LD>   "Darin Erstad is the real leader of this club," Eckstein said. "He
shows us how the game should be played. We look to him."</LD>
<TE>   The Angels looked to Erstad in the seventh inning of a scoreless
game Saturday night, and the Angel center fielder showed them the
way, leading off with a single, stealing second with a head-first
dive, taking third on an error and scoring the first run of the game
on Troy Glaus' single.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad then sparked a five-run rally in the eighth with a leadoff
single to help the Angels beat the Twins, 7-1, before 44,830 in
Edison Field, giving the Angels a commanding 3-1 lead in the
best-of-seven series and moving them within one victory of the first
World Series berth in the 42-year history of the franchise.</TE>
<TE>   "From my first day in the organization, when I stepped in, you
could tell Darin was the guy everyone looked up to here," Eckstein
said. "He gives up his body on defense. He makes things happen on
offense. If the pitcher is tough, he finds a way to get on base and
create havoc, as he proved again tonight."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels managed only two singles off Minnesota ace Brad Radke
in the first six innings when Erstad, the team leader with 14
postseason hits, opened the seventh. With a 1-and-2 count, Erstad
reached for a low-and-away changeup and blooped a hit to shallow
right-center field.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad had the green light with a 3-and-1 count on Tim Salmon, got
a good jump and took off for second base. Catcher A.J. Pierzynski's
throw bounced past second and into center field, and Erstad,
temporarily disoriented because his helmet covered his eyes, took his
next cue from the fans.</TE>
<TE>   "By the sounds of the crowd, I figured something had happened, and
then I saw the ball in the outfield," Erstad said. "I couldn't even
see third base, so I had to knock [the helmet] off. I felt like a
Little Leaguer with my helmet over my eyes."</TE>
<TE>   Two batters later, Erstad's teammates were pounding that helmet as
he returned to the dugout with the Angels' first run. After Erstad's
eighth-inning hit and run, he's batting .353 with seven runs in a
postseason that gets more exhilarating by the day.</TE>
<TE>   "It's becoming more unreal as you go through it," Erstad said.
"You play such intense games night after night. It's amazing. For all
the tough times we've been through, this is your reward."</TE>
<TE>   Erstad and tough times were running mates in 2001, when the stress
of a painful divorce and several nagging injuries conspired against
him. He brooded through the entire season, hitting .258 with nine
homers and 63 runs batted in. He was moody, sometimes aloof and often
unapproachable. For so long a model teammate, Erstad seemed to
distance himself from the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what the heck I was last year, but I didn't like
it," Erstad said. "It's safe to say everyone goes through tough times
in life. You have two choices; you can fold up the tent and pack it
in or let it make you stronger. I chose the latter. Tough times make
you appreciate what you have--that's the best way I can put it. No
question, I feel different this year. I'm me. Myself."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are glad to have him back. Nearly traded to the Chicago
White Sox over the winter, Erstad hit .283 with 10 homers and 73 RBIs
this season and was rewarded with a four-year, $32-million contract
extension on Aug. 3. The energy, the spark, the verve with which
Erstad has played the game for so long has returned.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a tough year for him last year," Angel bench coach Joe
Maddon said of Erstad. "We're not robots. We're affected by the human
condition. Now, he's much happier, he has a freer mind. He's able to
focus. He has less of an edge, and when you combine that with his
usual intensity, and you have a pretty good player. You definitely
see more of a joy about him."</TE>

<HD>Piniella Asks for Release</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seattle Mariner Manager Lou Piniella has asked out of the final year
of his $6.8-million contract, the Seattle Times reported on its Web
site Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   Piniella made the formal request Friday during a meeting in Tampa,
Fla., with Seattle team officials, including Chief Executive Howard
Lincoln.</LD>
<LD>   "I asked them if I could be allowed to get closer to home,"
Piniella told the Times from his home in Tampa. "We had an amicable
meeting, as amicable as amicable can be. We talked for over an hour.
Now they're going to make a decision."</LD>
<TE>   Mariner President Chuck Armstrong accompanied Lincoln and General
Manager Pat Gillick to Florida and said the team had not yet granted
Piniella's request.</TE>
<TE>   "ESPN reports that we have given permission for Lou to talk to the
Mets or Devil Rays are absolutely false," Armstrong said.</TE>
<TE>   Piniella, 59, has been Seattle's manager for the last 10 seasons.
After tying the major league record with 116 victories and reaching
the AL championship series for the second straight season in 2001,
the Mariners finished third in the AL West this year.</TE>
<TE>   But they won 93 games, the second-highest total in franchise
history, and led the majors in attendance for the second year in a
row.</TE>
<TE>   After the Mariners' final home game two weeks ago, Piniella was
asked if he could say definitively that he would be back in 2003.
"I'm signed for next year," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Piniella was unhappy with the Mariners because they would not
increase their $90-million payroll at the trade deadline in July. He
hoped the team would add a veteran hitter or starting pitcher.</TE>

<HD>Michigan Makes Penn State Pay in Overtime</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two of college football's most tradition-rich programs turned a dull
start into a fantastic finish.</LD>
<LD>   Chris Perry's three-yard touchdown run in overtime gave No. 13
Michigan a 27-24 victory over No. 15 Penn State at Ann Arbor, Mich.,
on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   After the teams trudged through the first 42-plus minutes tied at
7-7, they combined for 28 points and three lead changes. John
Navarre's second touchdown pass to Braylon Edwards -- his third
option in a crowded end zone -- with 3:24 left forced the first
overtime ever at Michigan Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   "That's what a great football game is," Michigan Coach Lloyd Carr
said. "It's back and forth, and you win it, and then you lose it,
then you win it."</TE>
<TE>   Michigan (5-1 overall, 2-0 in conference) won its sixth
consecutive game over Penn State (4-2, 1-2). The Nittany Lions
haven't lost that many in a row to any team in more than 70 years.</TE>
<TE>   "They've all been great wins, but none have been more exciting,"
Carr said. "This one had everything."</TE>
<TE>   Penn State Coach Joe Paterno, the winningest coach in Division
I-A, was so upset after the game that he wouldn't allow his players
to be interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   "Our kids played hard and their kids played hard," Paterno said.
"They had one more play than we had. It was as simple as that."</TE>
<TE>   Nittany Lion kicker Robbie Gould -- who missed an extra point and
a field goal in regulation -- missed a 23-yard field goal in
overtime. But Michigan was called for offsides, and Gould took
advantage of the opportunity with a 20-yard kick to put Penn State
ahead 24-21.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't blame it on the kicker," Paterno said.</TE>
<TE>   On Michigan's possession, Perry gained four yards on a third and
one from Penn State's 16. Four plays later, he plunged in for the
score.</TE>
<TE>   In the first quarter, Michigan cornerback Zia Combs was taken off
the field on a stretcher after he collided head-first into a
teammate's midsection. Combs has full movement and X-rays were
negative.</TE>
<TE>   No. 5 Ohio State 50, San Jose State 7 -- Freshman Maurice Clarett
scored three touchdowns and Craig Krenzel threw three touchdown
passes as the Buckeyes (7-0) used a balanced attack to beat the
Spartans (4-3) at Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Clarett, who had 132 yards in 18 carries, scored on runs of one
and five yards and had a seven-yard touchdown reception. Krenzel was
11 for 14 for 241 yards and also had touchdown pass plays of 40 yards
to Mike Jenkins and 37 yards to Chris Vance.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State scored 31 unanswered points to take a 41-7 lead midway
through the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The game was played before a crowd of 104,892, the largest ever at
Ohio Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 32, No. 23 Wisconsin 29 -- Gibran Hamdan threw three of
his four touchdown passes in the last 16 minutes to rally the
Hoosiers (3-3, 1-1) from a 19-point deficit for an upset of the
Badgers (5-2, 0-2) at Bloomington, Ind.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana defeated a ranked opponent for the first time since Oct.
21, 2000, a 51-43 victory over No. 22 Minnesota. The Hoosiers also
ended Wisconsin's three-game winning streak in Bloomington.</TE>
<TE>   Hamdan threw a 20-yard scoring pass to Glenn Johnson with 2:16
left to complete the comeback.</TE>
<TE>   Illinois 38, Purdue 31 -- Dustin Ward threw a seven-yard touchdown
pass to Greg Lewis in overtime to give the Illini (2-5, 1-2) a
victory over the Boilermakers (3-4, 1-2) at Champaign, Ill., after
Illinois blew a 24-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   After going up 24-0 in the first half, the Illini didn't score
again until Antoineo Harris scored from a yard out on fourth and goal
with seven seconds left to play, tying the score at 31-31. After
Lewis scored for Illinois in overtime, Brandon Kirsch's pass into the
end zone on fourth down was well short of his receiver.</TE>

<DL>IOWA CITY, Iowa</DL>
<LD>Beginning the game ranked 116th in the nation in pass defense, Iowa
came up with a plan to stop Michigan State receiver Charles Rogers on
Saturday -- study film and frustrate him with physical play.</LD>
<LD>   It worked.</LD>
<LD>   The Hawkeyes held Rogers to five catches for 78 yards and ended
his NCAA record streak of 14 consecutive games with a touchdown
reception. The defense also collected four sacks, forced two fumbles
and intercepted three passes as No. 17 Iowa defeated Michigan State,
44-16, in a Big Ten Conference game.</LD>
<TE>   The victory made Iowa (6-1, 3-0 in conference) bowl eligible, and
the Hawkeyes share the Big Ten lead with Ohio State.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa held Michigan State (3-3, 1-1) to 186 yards passing and 58
rushing.</TE>
<TE>   The Hawkeyes' offense, which entered the game leading the Big Ten,
had only 284 yards.</TE>

<AU>Mal Florence</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Jon Saraceno in USA Today: "Mike Tyson tells Details in a November
cover story that he could've defeated Lennox Lewis in their
heavyweight title match last summer, but ...</LD>
<LD>   " 'I'm sick right now,' Tyson told the magazine. 'And I don't mean
sick physically. I mean emotionally.'</LD>
<LD>   "In the understatement of the year, the former heavyweight
champion said this: 'Every day my elevator doesn't rise to the top
floor, and I know it.' "</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the UCLA record for consecutive passes
completed?</TE>
<TE>   New category: Hubert Mizell in the St. Petersburg Times: "NFL
teams have a dozen or more assistant coaches. I can't figure why so
many are needed. There is everything but a get-me-coffee guy....</TE>
<TE>   "Why not spend a few more lumps of NFL dough to hire a 'showoff
coach'? Egomaniacs need guidance. It's a league overburdened with
amateur exhibitionists.</TE>
<TE>   "Warren Sapp needs a dance teacher or somebody to tell him those
chubby quivers are painfully ugly."</TE>
<TE>   A drop in the ocean: Florida basketball Coach Billy Donovan, on
6-foot-6, 313-pound freshman center Mario Boggan: "Yeah, he's lost
some weight, but like I told our conditioning coach, it's like
throwing a lawn chair off the Titanic."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1960, Bill Mazeroski opened the
bottom of the ninth with a home run off Ralph Terry of the New York
Yankees to give the Pittsburgh Pirates a 10-9 victory and the World
Series championship.</TE>
<TE>   Forty? No sweat: Ann Killion in the San Jose Mercury News: "Jerry
Rice has put up plenty of numbers in his career. But none may be more
amazing than the number he will hit today: 40. As in years old.</TE>
<TE>   "Said quarterback Rich Gannon: 'Here's a guy who's the very best,
and he comes out in training camp 30 minutes before the other
players.' "</TE>
<TE>   In denial: Atlanta Brave pitcher Damian Moss on his team's early
exit from the playoffs: "The Giants did what they had to do to beat
us, but in a seven-game series, I think it'd be different. Because I
think we're definitely the best team."</TE>
<TE>   Sure you are, but the "best team" is staying home--again.</TE>
<TE>   Helping hand: If Washington Redskin quarterback Patrick Ramsey
succeeds in his first NFL start today against New Orleans, he will
have to thank Saints' receiver Donte Stallworth.</TE>
<TE>   During Ramsey's 16-day absence from training camp, he worked out
with Stallworth in Memphis, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   Bored: Bernie Lincicome in the Rocky Mountain News: "Still another
return by Michael Jordan has been greeted with the excitement usually
reserved for dandelions."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Rick Neuheisel, 17, against Washington in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Atlanta Brave General Manager John Schuerholz on his
team's setback: "It's a kick in the stomach emotionally. But those of
us in these positions have a responsibility to look forward, start
looking ahead to what we can do better for next year."</TE>

<HD>Olausson Sees Old Team</HD>

<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Defenseman Fredrik Olausson will get to catch up with a few friends
today, when the Ducks face the Detroit Red Wings in their home opener
at the Arrowhead Pond.</LD>
<LD>   It's doubtful that Sergei Fedorov and Brendan Shanahan will pause
to say hello, but Olausson spent 2001-02 with the Red Wings after
playing the previous season in Switzerland.</LD>
<LD>   "It'll be good to see those guys, but I was only there one year,"
said Olausson, who is in his third tour of duty with the Ducks. "It's
not like I spent my whole career there."</LD>
<TE>   Still, Olausson was a key component in the Red Wings' run to the
Stanley Cup championship. He took the cup home to Sweden for a party,
then signed a contract to play there, only to change his mind and
sign a $1.1-million contract with the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Bryan Murray, needing to put some power in the
Ducks' power play, brought Olausson in to quarterback things from the
blue line. The Ducks had the NHL's top power play with Olausson in
1998-99. The only question is his durability.</TE>
<TE>   Olausson, 37, has had injury problems. He appeared in only 47
games with the Red Wings last season and hasn't played a full season
in the NHL since leaving the Ducks after the 1999-2000 season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mike Babcock will coach his first game at the Pond today, although
the arena will feel like home because his father and three sisters
will be there.</TE>
<TE>   It was the wish of his mother, Gail, who died of cancer in 1990,
that the family show up for Babcock's first NHL home game. He was the
coach at Red Deer College at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the great gifts of cancer is the ability to say goodbye to
your family," Babcock said. "She made them promise they would come,
so they are coming. That's a good deal that they will be there, but
I'm counting on Mom."</TE>

<TE>   Update -- The Red Wings lost Dominik Hasek and are without Steve
Yzerman until January. Still, they remain one of the favorites to win
the Stanley Cup, which would be their fourth championship in the last
seven seasons. Curtis Joseph was signed to replace Hasek. Ceremonies
honoring the Ducks' first team will begin at 5:45 p.m.</TE>

<AU>Bill Dwyre</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saturday was a good day in heaven for Marv Goux. Make that a great
day.</LD>
<LD>   Ever since the greatest assistant coach in the history of USC
football passed away in late July, he had been arguing with God about
the need to get DirecTV up there. He was pretty sure God was a Notre
Dame fan and She had been stalling because there hadn't been much to
watch the last few years. Then, low and behold, the Irish started 5-0
and there was DirecTV.</LD>
<LD>   As far as Marv was concerned, not a moment too soon. His Trojans,
the team for which he was captain in 1955 as a 5-foot-10, 185-pound
center and linebacker and for which he served as an assistant coach
from 1957 to '82, was supposed to be good this year, even nationally
ranked. But he had heard it was struggling a bit.</LD>
<TE>   So he gathered up the guys, Giles Pellerin and Morley Drury,
grabbed the remote and settled in.</TE>
<TE>   And what he saw amazed him. It wasn't just the football game, but
lots of other stuff. He clicked a couple of channels and there was
Pat Haden, doing commentary on a Notre Dame game. He still had
trouble coming to grips with that. And then he clicked again and
there was the American League championship series. He had to blink
twice when he realized the game was coming from Anaheim, and the
Angels ... yes, THE ANGELS ...  were winning again. Morley was also
stunned, asking who the Angels were, and Giles hobbled off to find
Gene Autry.</TE>
<TE>   Comforting to Marv was that, when he found the SC game, it was
against Cal. Ah, Cal, the Trojans' doormat, the team that had played
USC 89 times over the years and won just 29 of those games. Marv
chuckled. Cal was always the place where the best marches came from
the students, not the football team. This was going to be good.</TE>
<TE>   Marv found out that his Trojans were 3-2, but ranked 20th in the
country. He also found out, quite quickly, that Cal wasn't Cal,
meaning they were pretty good. How could this be?</TE>
<TE>   Marv watched in amazement as a quarterback named Kyle Boller
started the game by slicing up the USC secondary like a guy doing
onions in the kitchen. And he was shedding no tears.</TE>
<TE>   And when it got to 21-3, Marv was beside himself. Where was the
fire, the Trojan pride?</TE>
<TE>   He remembered when he was coaching the linemen and it was late in
the season and he'd walk around with his fists clenched and his jaw
set. He'd tell these young men how it was, that next up was UCLA, a
nice little team from over there in Westwood that would usually fold
in the late going.</TE>
<TE>   And then, after that, the big game.</TE>
<TE>   He remembered how he'd grab them by the front of the jersey,
sometimes two of them at a time, look them right in the eye and
shout: "Then comes Notre Dame. Big man against big man. Nothing else
matters. They live for this. You live for this."</TE>
<TE>   Marv had not lived for 21-3 deficits against Cal. He was furious.
But then it turned, and he started feeling better.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans got the ball to their star wide receiver deep in the
end zone. He lunged, bent forward and appeared to cradle it as he
went down. As one official signaled touchdown, another seemed to
indicate that the ball had slipped out of Kareem Kelly's grasp as he
fell. As they discussed it, the giant screen overhead had a replay
from an angle that showed the ball popping out and hitting the ground
as Kelly went down.</TE>
<TE>   Seconds after the replay ended, one official signaled touchdown,
and Marv was ecstatic. Now this was the kind of stuff he had lived
for. He remembered an old saying around the coaches' lockers: "It's
not whether you won or lost, but how well the referees screwed the
opponents in the Coliseum." It all came rushing back to him.</TE>
<TE>   And from here, it just got better and better. The two
quarterbacks, Boller and the Trojans' Carson Palmer, both smart,
poised veterans, were going at it as if this was a scene from "High
Noon." Boller drew and fired. Palmer fired right back.</TE>
<TE>   And even better, his Trojans were taking command of the game not
only with Palmer's passing, but with some of the best rushing offense
they have demonstrated in years. Sultan McCullough might just as well
have been Charles White or Mike Garrett in this one, bouncing in and
around Cal's line for 176 yards. If he closed his eyes, Marv could
visualize Student Body Right.</TE>
<TE>   At the end, with a crowd of 63,113 on its feet, on the kind of
crisp October night in Southern California that provides such a great
stage for college football, and with the Trojans smothering Cal's
last gasp by falling on an on-side kick, Marv was, well, in heaven.</TE>
<TE>   Sleep came easily, with the strains of "Fight On" and "Conquest"
floating through his mind, and, instead of sheep to count, just a
pleasant parade of men with whistles in their mouths, arms thrust to
the heavens.</TE>

<LD>The doubters can form a line to the right, between those that don't
believe Notre Dame is back and those that believe Elvis soon will be.</LD>
<LD>   But the truth of the matter is that North Carolina State is off to
its second-best start in a mostly mundane 111 years of football.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, there have been a few Peach Bowl victories and an occasional
exciting player that passed through Raleigh (Torry Holt, please stand
up and wave), but more often than not, the Wolfpack is better known
in college football circles for being the alma mater of ESPN and ABC
analyst Dr. Jerry Punch.</LD>
<TE>   N.C. State is 7-0 after Saturday's physical 34-17 pasting of North
Carolina, the former football king of Tobacco Road, and things
haven't been this fun for the Wolfpack since an 8-0 start in 1967,
when Coach Chuck Amato was playing linebacker for a guy named Lou
Holtz.</TE>
<TE>   Ranked No. 14, N.C. State has just about everything going its way.
Philip Rivers is the nation's top-rated passer and freshman T.A.
McLendon already has 12 rushing touchdowns this season.</TE>
<TE>   Karma has also been kind to the Wolfpack: On the way to Saturday's
game, the police car in which Amato and wrestling Coach Bob Guzzo
were riding was forced off Interstate 40 because of a flat tire. The
two coaches stopped one of the team buses and boarded it.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole day started off bad," Amato said. "I got on the bus and
said this is the only loss we're going to have today."</TE>
<TE>   Heck, N.C. State even has its own version of Thunder and
Lightning: Safety Terrence "Lightning Bolt" Holt and linebacker
Dantonio "Thunder Dan" Burnette are on a defense that has given up
more than 19 points in only two games.</TE>
<TE>   But before North Carolinians purchase round-trip tickets to Tempe,
Ariz. for the Fiesta Bowl, there's the little matter of this soft
schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas State Coach Bill Snyder would blush at the creampuffs N.C.
State has faced so far: New Mexico, East Tennessee State, Navy, Wake
Forest, Texas Tech, Massachusetts and North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   There'll be another laugher next week against Duke before things
finally get interesting Oct. 26 at Clemson. And, of course, Florida
State comes to Carter-Finley Stadium for the regular-season finale.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, the Wolfpack can smile at its good fortune,
particularly on a day when Rivers threw only five passes in the
second half.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a Heisman Trophy candidate and he's handing the ball
off," said Amato, in his third season at N.C. State after 18 seasons
as a Florida State assistant. "It was a beauty to see."</TE>
<TE>   The Hook for Zook?</TE>
<TE>   It's back, and it's getting more visitors than ever.</TE>
<TE>   FireRonZook.com was shut down after its owner received a phalanx
of hate mail, but it's up and running again with a determined second
effort to dethrone the embattled Florida coach.</TE>
<TE>   Demand is rising: Visitors who tried to get onto the site after
Florida's embarrassing 36-7 loss to Louisiana State at Gainesville
were denied for hours by the following words: "Please be patient and
try again in a few seconds ... the Web site you are trying to access
is experiencing an extremely high volume of traffic."</TE>
<TE>   The site emerged this spring and called for Zook's resignation
months before his first Florida game, but its owner, who identified
himself as "Mark" to the St. Petersburg Times, took the site down in
April after being hit with a flood of give-the-guy-a-chance e-mails.</TE>
<TE>   Less than six months later, after seeing the Gators' recent
regression under Zook, "Mark" has seen enough.</TE>
<TE>   "We sat back and gave him a chance ... now we're serious," said
the site's new flash introduction.</TE>
<TE>   The site counts down the days to Zook's "removal," using his
three-year contract as an end date.</TE>
<TE>   Watch Your Language</TE>
<TE>   There were a lot of "dangs" and "flippins" at Vanderbilt on
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The hapless Commodores lost to unheralded Middle Tennessee State
for a second consecutive season, 21-20, and had to refrain from
swearing, as per a policy installed by first-year Coach Bobby
Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   For each foul word uttered, a player must perform 10 "up-downs" at
practice, a drill in which a player runs in place, drops flat to the
ground, then jumps up and starts the process again.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Times published a commentary bemoaning Johnson's
stance against profanity, although Vanderbilt players are willing to
try anything: The Commodores (1-5) have had 19 consecutive losing
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Cadillac Dented</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas crushed Auburn, 38-17, and its players had a few choice
words for Auburn running back Carnell "Cadillac" Williams, who gained
99 yards in 24 carries and failed to break any long runs.</TE>
<TE>   "We gave the Cadillac a flat tire," Arkansas defensive tackle
Jermaine Brooks said. "We had signs about Cadillac in our locker room
all week that we had to stare at. We just got sick and tired of it.
If you stop him, you stop Auburn."</TE>
<TE>   The best running back in the game was Arkansas' Fred Talley, who
ran for 241 yards in place of injured Cedric Cobbs.</TE>
<TE>   Talley's total was the second-best performance in school history,
behind 271 by Dickey Morton in 1973.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, I was feeling like they blew the play dead or
something," Talley said.</TE>
<TE>   Badgering Everybody</TE>
<TE>   Wisconsin Coach Barry Alvarez recently sent an e-mail to 12,500
student season-ticket holders, asking them to refrain from using a
vulgar chant that includes two curse words.</TE>
<TE>   "Be loud. Be creative. Be a part of the game. Be classy," Alvarez
pleaded, indicating that the chant, a student-section staple for more
than 20 years, was offensive to parents who attend Badger games with
young children.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps this week Alvarez should fire off e-mails to his defensive
coaches. The Badgers blew a 29-10 third-quarter lead at Indiana and
lost, 32-29.</TE>
<TE>   Gibran Hamdan threw three of his four touchdown passes in the last
16 minutes to lead the Hoosier comeback. When time ran out, Indiana
players celebrated at midfield, leaping into the air and exchanging
high-fives and hugs.</TE>
<TE>   Said Alvarez: "We played poorly on defense."</TE>
<TE>   The Next Prairie View?</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota-Morris tied an NCAA Division II record with its 39th
consecutive loss in a 52-14 defeat against Winona State.</TE>
<TE>   But the streak may be ending soon for the Cougars (0-6): None of
their next five opponents have a winning record.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to take advantage of that," Coach Ken Crandall said.
"We've just got to feel a little better about what we're doing."</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota-Morris has a long way to go to match Prairie View A&amp;M,
which holds the Division I record for futility with 80 consecutive
losses from 1989-98.</TE>
<TE>   Grab a Calculator</TE>
<TE>   Colorado running back Chris Brown was piling up yardage so quickly
against a soft Kansas defense, he had trouble keeping up with
himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I was at 170," said Colorado's 6-foot-3, 220-pound
tailback. "But I guess I was way off."</TE>
<TE>   He was off by 139 yards, shredding the Jayhawks for 309 yards
during a 53-29 Colorado victory.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas quickly fell behind 14-0 for the third consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   "There's one thing we have to do," Kansas Coach Mark Mangino said.

<HD>Galaxy Looking to Hit Double in Title Games</HD>
<DH>Team can win MLS championship and U.S. Open Cup final
within five days on opponents' home fields.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Galaxy has known since Sept. 10 that its opponent in the U.S.
Open Cup final on Oct. 24 would be the Columbus Crew and that it
would have to travel to Ohio to defend its title.</LD>
<LD>   The Galaxy has also known since closing out its Major League
Soccer semifinal playoff series Wednesday night that it would be
playing in the MLS Cup title match on Oct. 20 at Gillette Stadium in
Foxboro, Mass.</LD>
<LD>   Saturday afternoon, though, the Galaxy found out that its opponent
in the league championship game would be the New England Revolution,
courtesy of its 2-2 semifinal series-clinching tie with the Crew.</LD>
<TE>   As such, the Western Conference champion and No. 1-seeded Galaxy
will travel to play for two championships in five days and attempt to
"do the double," win the two American domestic titles, in each team's
raucous home stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "I think from the standpoint of the league it's the ideal
matchup," Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid said of the MLS Cup pairing from
Foxboro, Mass., where he watched the Revolution-Crew game. "I think
with [New England] playing at home it's going to generate a huge
crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "And from our standpoint, it's nice not to play the same team back
to back like that. We'll see fresh teams."</TE>
<TE>   But what about being the visiting team on what are supposed to be
neutral fields?</TE>
<TE>   "That's our lot this year," Schmid said. "When you look at what
we've accomplished as a club in the last two years, we've played in
five tournaments and we've now qualified for five finals. Last year
we won two out of three and this year we'd like to win a couple
again." Schmid was referring to victories last year in the Champions
Cup and U.S. Open Cup and a loss in the MLS Cup.</TE>
<TE>   First up for the Galaxy is the Eastern Conference champion and No.
2-seeded Revolution, which has thrived under interim Coach Steve
Nicol, who replaced the fired Fernando Clavijo on May 23. New England
won its first-round playoff series against the Chicago Fire, six
points to three, with two 2-0 wins and a 2-1 loss.</TE>
<TE>   The Revolution then beat the Crew, five points to two, with a 1-0
victory and two ties, 0-0 and 2-2.</TE>
<TE>   New England, which finished 12-14-2 this season after missing the
playoffs with a 7-14-6 record in 2001, split its season series with
the Galaxy with each team victorious at home.</TE>
<TE>   The Revolution won, 3-2, in Nicol's first game on May 25 and the
Galaxy pulled out a 2-1 victory on Aug. 10.</TE>
<TE>   Revolution forward Taylor Twellman and Galaxy striker Carlos Ruiz
had a stirring battle for the league scoring race that ended with
Twellman edging Ruiz, 52-49. Ruiz, though, led the MLS with 24 goals.</TE>
<TE>   The two first-year MLS players are front-runners for the league's
most-valuable-player award, though Ruiz has set single postseason
records with seven goals and 16 points while Twellman, who sat out
Saturday's decisive match because of a knee injury, has two goals and
four points in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Schmid expects to see Twellman play next week.</TE>

<HD>And Away Griffith Goes--Wide Left</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>UCLA kicker Chris Griffith said last week that Saturday's game
against Oregon meant more to him than the one later this season
against USC. There was no reason not to believe him. No UCLA player
would say such a thing unless he meant it.</LD>
<LD>   It was understandable too. When the Bruins played the Ducks last
season, Coach Bob Toledo turned the game to Griffith's right foot,
setting him up for a 50-yard field goal that would have given the
victory to UCLA. Griffith missed. Oregon won, 21-20.</LD>
<LD>   Toledo was criticized for conservative play calling that didn't
give his offense much of a chance to move the ball closer for
Griffith and the Bruins, who only a couple of weeks earlier had been
dreaming of a berth in the national championship game, remained in a
funk with their third consecutive loss en route to a fourth -- 27-0
the next Saturday to USC.</LD>
<TE>   But the anguish of last season, in particular the loss to Oregon,
lingered with none of the Bruins as much as it did for Griffith. He
said that hardly a day went by that he didn't think of the missed
kick that had let his teammates down and betrayed Toledo's confidence
in him. He was thinking about it even while standing on the sideline
Saturday at the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "When the difference was only three at halftime, I just had a
feeling it was going to come down to the last play," he would say
later.</TE>
<TE>   He wanted it to come down to the last play, to him.</TE>
<TE>   It did.</TE>
<TE>   Although Toledo wasn't exactly playing for a field goal as he did
last season, neither did he call any risky plays on UCLA's last drive
that might have moved them out of range for one.</TE>
<TE>   So there they were, again, facing fourth down and 14 at the Oregon
29 with less than two minutes remaining when Griffith got his chance.
He trotted onto the field for a field-goal attempt, this one from 46
yards, that would give the Bruins a lead and enable him to put last
year behind him.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt really good," he would say later. "I hit it really good.
Wide left. That's the way it goes."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wide left. They're cursing those words today in Tallahassee and
Westwood.</TE>
<TE>   I didn't see much of the game between Florida State and Miami,
which ended with the Seminoles missing a game-winning field-goal
attempt as time expired, but I can vouch for the fact that 68,882
fans at the Rose Bowl for Oregon's 31-30 victory saw an extremely
entertaining game.</TE>
<TE>   That seemed destined from UCLA's first play, when Cory Paus threw
a 55-yard touchdown pass to Tab Perry. Oregon drove 80 yards in six
plays to tie. Toledo tricked the Ducks with a 53-yard touchdown pass
from a wide receiver lined up in the backfield, Jon Dubravac, to
Craig Bragg. Oregon drove 80 yards in six plays to tie.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon's Keenan Howry returned a punt 79 yards for a touchdown.
Paus found Bragg for a 71-yard touchdown pass after the Duck
cornerback fell. Bragg scored his third touchdown after pulling down
a Paus pass with one hand and running 46 yards. A 96-yard kickoff
return by Oregon's Allan Amundson was called back because of holding.
The Ducks did score again, on a 74-yard pass play from Jason Fife to
Howry.</TE>
<TE>   You could imagine the coaches, Toledo and Oregon's Mike Bellotti,
drawing plays in the dirt behind the benches.</TE>
<TE>   And then the game came down to the kicker.</TE>
<TE>   The kickers, actually.</TE>
<TE>   Hardly lost in all the excitement was sophomore Jared Siegel's
59-yard field goal, tying the record for a Pacific 10 Conference
game, as time ran out in the first half. Those three points proved
very important.</TE>
<TE>   Hardly lost in the postgame analysis for UCLA was not just
Griffith's miss in the fourth quarter but also his low extra-point
attempt that was blocked in the third. That one point proved very
important.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So it appears as if neither UCLA nor USC will play in the Rose
Bowl game on Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans were for all practical purposes eliminated last
weekend, when their kicker missed an extra-point try in the fourth
quarter that would have made it more difficult for Washington State
to come back and win in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Griffith said he hadn't heard about that. He shrugged. He said he
had enough problems of his own without worrying about those of the
cross-town kicker.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo tried to deflect the blame from him, a little.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to believe that the game came down to one play again,"
he said, adding that it wasn't merely that one play that cost the
Bruins the game.</TE>
<TE>   He also said that his decision to fake a 45-yard field-goal
attempt on fourth and 15 late in the third quarter--an odd call
resulting in an eight-yard pass from holder Garrett Lepisto to
Marcedes Lewis--shouldn't be interpreted as a loss of confidence in
Griffith.</TE>
<TE>   But Griffith, seven for 12 in field-goal attempts this season,
didn't seem too sure of anything except that he had again failed
against Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   A senior who came to UCLA as a walk-on five years ago and earned a
scholarship, he stood in front of his locker and answered the same
questions from one wave of reporters after another.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, I could see it was coming down to me and I wanted to
get on the field," he said. "I had been thinking during the game
about the situation last year, but I wasn't thinking about it when I
went out there. I was focused on what I had to do.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what happened. I just missed."</TE>
<TE>   That's the way it goes. Wide left.</TE>

<HD>Midnight Strikes Without Key Pair</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As the clock neared midnight Friday, 10 lonely cars and an RV sat in
a parking lot at Figueroa and Jefferson.</LD>
<LD>   It was on these grounds that a standing-room-only crowd was
supposed to be assembled, soaking in the ambience of the school's
sparkling new events center while celebrating the advent of another
college basketball season.</LD>
<LD>   But with the long-talked-about USC arena still in the planning
stages, the throng packed itself into the quaint on-campus Lyon
Center for the Trojan version of Midnight Madness for the third
consecutive year.</LD>
<TE>   Four of the eight Southland area schools with Division I programs
-- USC, UC Irvine, Loyola Marymount and Pepperdine -- held
fan-friendly proceedings that included intra-squad scrimmages,
slam-dunk and shooting contests to commemorate the official start of
practice. At USC, two of the more exciting and high-flying Trojans --
junior forward Jerry Dupree and sophomore guard Errick Craven -- were
reduced to being sideline cheerleaders.</TE>
<TE>   Dupree, suspended by Trojan Coach Henry Bibby for the first six
games of the regular season to help him concentrate on his studies,
sat out because he has been experiencing debilitating stomach pains
lately. Craven also felt Bibby's wrath and was in street clothes,
suspended from the event for missing a team meeting.</TE>
<TE>   And only Bibby would call a timeout in the middle of the 10-minute
free-for-all scrimmage that resembled a street-ball game to call set
plays and to calm down his amped-up team, which is heavy on junior
college transfers after losing three senior starters.</TE>
<TE>   Madness indeed.</TE>
<TE>   "It was all a miscommunication," said a sheepish Craven, the
team's returning leading scorer and an all-Pacific 10 Conference
freshman selection last year. "I missed a meeting and [Bibby is]
trying to make a point to the younger guys that you can't miss
anything, making an example of me. But that's OK, just as long as I
don't miss any games."</TE>
<TE>   Dupree, who became a fan favorite during the Trojans' run to the
championship game of the resurrected Pac-10 tournament at Staples
Center last March, would have been the favorite to win the slam-dunk
contest. But with Derrick Craven missing dunks, walk-on Eze Burts
won.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a growing experience and it's going to make me more
hungry for when I do come back," Dupree said.</TE>
<TE>   Dupree spent four days at the university hospital last week
because of stomach pains.</TE>
<TE>   "The doctors don't know what it is," Dupree said. "I'm thinking
it's a pulled muscle."</TE>
<TE>   It would have been easy for Dupree's running mate, junior guard
Desmon Farmer, to have suffered from a bruised ego after losing a
three-point shooting contest to USC junior guard Rometra Craig.</TE>
<TE>   But the eclectic and emotional Farmer was having none of it on
this night.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach has asked me to be a leader and I've accepted that role and
I hope to produce," Farmer said. "He's been telling me since I was a
freshman that this was going to be my team one day but I was just
hardheaded and wanted it early. This is exciting."</TE>
<TE>   Some would call it maddening.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When racing on soggy turf at Keeneland, it is best to stay on the
outside part of the course.</LD>
<LD>   Riskaverse, a 7-1 shot who rallied widest of all, was up to collar
5-1 shot Zenda, who also came wide with her run, in the final strides
to win the $500,000 Queen Elizabeth II Challenge Cup in Kentucky on
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Owned and bred by the Fox Ridge Farm and trained by Patrick Kelly,
the daughter of Dynaformer won what was arguably the best race of the
year for 3-year-old turf fillies. Ridden by Mark Guidry, Riskaverse
completed the 1 1/8 miles over a course labeled good in 1:49 4/5.</LD>
<TE>   While the first two finishers and Lush Soldier, a 43-1 shot who
finished third, were wide, Wonder Again, the 2-1 favorite, and 2-1
second choice Megahertz got bogged down while trying to rally along
the deeper inside. The former, who had won four in a row on the grass
for trainer Jimmy Toner, finished fifth, a length in front of
Megahertz, who had won five of her first six in this country for
owner Michael Bello and trainer Bobby Frankel.</TE>
<TE>   Second and third in her two previous tries in Grade I races,
Riskaverse won for the fifth time in 12 starts. She has been
consistent, missing the board only twice.</TE>
<TE>   "Mark rode her great," said Kelly. "She's a natural closer and the
mile and an eighth suits her well and she handles the soft turf.</TE>
<TE>   "She had a few things going for her and she responded with a real
nice effort. I don't know about the Breeders' Cup [Filly and Mare
Turf in only 13 days]. This was sort of the Breeders' Cup for
3-year-old fillies."</TE>
<TE>   Making her American debut after winning twice in six starts in
England, France and Ireland, Zenda finished six lengths clear of Lush
Solider after breaking last under jockey Richard Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   "She ran well," said Hughes, who rode her in five of her six races
overseas. "I thought we were home, but she got tired the last hundred
yards."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Preparing for the final start of his career in the Breeders' Cup
Classic, Kentucky Derby winner War Emblem worked seven furlongs in
1:24 about 30 minutes before Saturday's first race at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   With regular exercise rider Dana Barnes aboard, the 3-year-old
went the first quarter of a mile in 24 3/5, the half in 48 2/5, six
furlongs in 1:12 1/5 and galloped out a mile in 1:38 3/5.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by the Thoroughbred Corp. and trained by Bob Baffert, War
Emblem hasn't run since finishing sixth as the favorite in Del Mar's
Pacific Classic on Aug. 25.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to work him in the afternoon because he can get a bit
antsy around other horses in the morning," said Baffert. "All systems
are go."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rolly Polly, the 17-10 favorite, remained unbeaten in three starts
on the Santa Anita turf course, but her ninth lifetime win did not
come easily.</TE>
<TE>   Seemingly beaten approaching the wire, the 4-year-old, Irish-bred
filly surged to edge 5-1 shot I'm The Business and win the $114,100
Sen. Ken Maddy Handicap by a nose.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Valenzuela rode the winner, who completed about 6 1/2
furlongs in 1:12 4/5, for Frankel and owner Guy Wildenstein.</TE>
<TE>   A nose winner of the Hillsborough Handicap last month at Bay
Meadows, I'm The Business has now been no worse than third in her
last 11 starts for trainer Roger Stein. Nanogram, a 16-1 shot, was up
to finish third, a length in front of 4-1 second choice Adoration.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Mieszerski</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Ransom proved Saturday night why he is the top-rated quarter
horse in America and he got paid handsomely in the process.</TE>
<TE>   The six-year-old gelding by First Down Dash got all he could
handle from nemesis Whosleavingwho, before taking the 53rd running of
the $200,000 Los Alamitos Invitational Championship in a photo
finish.</TE>
<TE>   The victory in the 440-yard Grade I race paid $100,000 to owners
John and Kathie Bobenrieths and pushed A Ransom's career earnings
over $1 million. Whosleavingwho, which has never beaten A Ransom,
earned $35,000. Runahalf, a 45-1 long shot, finished third. The
winning time was 21.41 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   A Ransom came into the race as a heavy favorite with victories in
three of the track's Grade I events. He had lost only twice in his
last 15 starts and became only the fifth horse to win the
Invitational twice.</TE>

<HD>De La Salle Dances Away</HD>
<DH>Northern California football team runs national-record
winning streak to 130 games with an easy 28-7 victory over Long Beach
Poly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ben Bolch</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>Before its players can dance off the field, before its coach can
legitimately call it the greatest victory in school history, Concord
De La Salle High is going to have to find some stiffer competition.</LD>
<LD>   The Spartans handled Long Beach Poly for a second consecutive
season with their 28-7 victory Saturday afternoon before an estimated
14,000 at California's Memorial Stadium. The victory over what is
purported to be their greatest challenger touched off an
unnecessarily wild celebration.</LD>
<LD>   But the game--and the series--between what widely have been
considered the top two teams in the country these last two seasons
has been about as compelling as a James Garner film festival.</LD>
<TE>   Consensus No. 1 De La Salle (5-0) scored on its first possession,
built a 28-point lead before the end of the third quarter
and--gasp!--gave up a meaningless Poly touchdown in stretching its
national-record winning streak to 130 games. The Spartans have
outscored the Jackrabbits, 57-22, in the teams' two meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Britt Cecil, who had yet to throw a scoring pass
before Saturday, connected on three touchdown passes and ran for
another score in becoming the latest unknown to etch his name in
Spartan lore. The 5-foot-11 senior completed 12 of 17 passes for a
career-high 237 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "He was unbelievable," said De La Salle Coach Bob Ladouceur, who
freely piled on the superlatives afterward. "That ranks up there as
one of the top performances for a De La Salle quarterback."</TE>
<TE>   Running back Maurice Drew complemented the passing attack by
rushing for 161 yards in 19 carries, including a 13-yard gain on the
Spartans' first series in which he spun away from a defender and
somehow managed to stay on his feet. Cecil bulled ahead for a
one-yard touchdown on the next play.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference was Drew. He was phenomenal," Poly Coach Raul Lara
said. "We stressed that we needed to tackle him, and apparently we
didn't do that."</TE>
<TE>   The Jackrabbits (4-1) made a few spectacular plays of their own,
including a converted fake punt, but were unable to sustain drives
past midfield in the first half. Poly reached De La Salle territory
twice before being besieged by dropped passes, penalties and an
inability to run the football. The Jackrabbits managed two yards
rushing in the first half and trailed, 14-0, at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   After being sacked three times in the first half, Poly quarterback
Leon Jackson showed renewed confidence early in the third quarter as
he completed two passes to Jeremiah Toloumu for first downs. But
after a short loss on a run and two incompletions, the Jackrabbits
had to punt.</TE>
<TE>   De La Salle broke the game open on its next series when Cecil
connected with De'Montae Fitzgerald on a medium-range pass at the
Spartan 44-yard line, but Fitzgerald picked up a couple of blocks to
turn the play into a 73-yard touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Cecil hooked up with Terrance Kelly on a 36-yard touchdown on De
La Salle's next series to make it 28-0 with 3 minutes 26 seconds left
in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Undeterred, Poly marched from its own 20 to the Spartan 1, where
it had a first and goal. But on second down, the snap squirted past
Jackson and was recovered by Drew at the nine.</TE>
<TE>   "It hurts. It hurts me," said Lara. "It's hard for me to sit up
here and smile. I thought we were ready for this game, but apparently
[De La Salle] was a lot better than us today."</TE>
<TE>   Poly scored its touchdown early in the fourth quarter when Lorenzo
Bursey took a short pass from Jackson and extended his arms across
the goal line for a 16-yard score. Jackrabbit defensive back Rodney
Van recovered an onside kick with nine minutes to go, and Poly
suddenly owned a sliver of hope.</TE>
<TE>   But any thoughts of a colossal comeback quickly dissipated when
the Jackrabbits failed to convert a first down on their ensuing
drive.</TE>
<TE>   With Poly out of the way--the Jackrabbits and Spartans likely
won't meet again until 2005 at the earliest--the Spartans can set
their sights on doubling the previous record winning streak of 72
games, set by Hudson (Mich.) High from 1968-75. That could happen by
the middle of next season.</TE>

<LD>It's foolish to think Concord De La Salle High is going to lose a
football game anytime soon. Those who thought Long Beach Poly's
speed, size and tradition might threaten the Spartans' winning streak
were living a dream.</LD>
<LD>   De La Salle has won 130 consecutive games over 11 seasons because
its coach, Bob Ladouceur, is a high school version of John Wooden.
The Spartans demolished Poly, 28-7, Saturday at California's Memorial
Stadium with their usual display of fundamentals and unselfishness.</LD>
<LD>   While teenagers usually want glitter, hype, fancy towels and
fancier nicknames, Ladouceur repeatedly convinces his players to
sacrifice in the name of victory.</LD>
<TE>   "You're playing for the guy next to you," defensive lineman Chris
Mulvanny said.</TE>
<TE>   De La Salle players will do anything for the good of the team. On
De'Montae Fitzgerald's 73-yard touchdown reception in the third
quarter that broke open a 13-0 game, it was teammates' downfield
blocking that created the open lanes. They gave up their bodies to
shield Fitzgerald and left even the most loyal Poly supporters
sensing defeat was inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, De La Salle (5-0) came up with a surprise standout in
a big game. Last season, it was unsung running back Maurice Drew
scoring four touchdowns in a 29-15 victory over Poly. This time,
quarterback Britt Cecil, who hadn't thrown a touchdown pass this
season, threw three, ran in one and passed for 237 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Poly players never think another team is better than them, but De
La Salle's overwhelming performance earned praise from the
Jackrabbits.</TE>
<TE>   "They execute everything," linebacker Mark Washington said.
"They're almost on a college level. Their coach has them ready for
every situation."</TE>
<TE>   Poly defensive back Freddie Parish, who has committed to Notre
Dame, said, "Their hearts were bigger than ours today."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone among the crowd of more than 14,000 would say Poly's
overall team speed was better.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way we could duplicate their speed," Ladouceur said.
"We're not slow, but we're not as fast as they are."</TE>
<TE>   De La Salle didn't allow any game-breaking plays because of a
disciplined defense that doesn't gamble and always tries to contain.</TE>
<TE>   "We worked hard on our technique," said Mulvanny, who had two
sacks. "The coaches explained [Poly] may be bigger and faster but
technique would win the game."</TE>
<TE>   The question many want to know is how long can De La Salle keep
winning? The answer is probably as long as the players keep listening
to Ladouceur.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an extraordinary feat," USC Coach Pete Carroll said earlier
this week about the streak. "They have so many kids playing hard,
aggressive football. They really capture an intensity level. It's the
way they play that's so special."</TE>
<TE>   Ladouceur has been dubbed "the coach who never loses," and it's
true. The unbeaten streak has lasted 10 years, 32 days, and neither
Ladouceur nor his players show any discomfort over the pressure to
keep winning.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's amazing in so much that our high school kids have
been able to maintain their level of focus and attention," he said.
"A lot of people think high school kids are lazy and flaky. That has
not been my experience. They've been very mature about their approach
to everything around this school."</TE>
<TE>   The Spartans certainly turned in their best effort Saturday. All
summer and fall, their focus had been on preparing for Poly. "This
whole year was dedicated to this game," Mulvanny said.</TE>
<TE>   Now Poly (4-1) must regroup to defend its Southern Section
Division I championship. There will be tests ahead, with Los
Alamitos, L.A. Loyola, Santa Ana Mater Dei and Anaheim Servite
lurking as challengers. The Jackrabbits are capable of finishing on
top. Parish and Washington are defensive standouts. Center Hercules
Satele is a punishing blocker, and quarterback Leon Jackson still has
time to improve.</TE>
<TE>   But they must admit that De La Salle is in a class by itself in
California football.</TE>
<TE>   "Eventually [the streak's] going to end, but I can't see it
happening anytime soon," Washington said. "I'm definitely a believer.
You can't refute it when you get beat twice."</TE>

Southland Sweep
Six of Concord De La Salle's record 130 consecutive football
victories have come at the expense of two of the Southland's most
storied programs. The results:
1998
De La Salle 28, Mater Dei 21

third-and-32 situation at its own 19, Atari Callen gained 58 yards on
a draw play. Three plays later, the Spartans scored the winning
touchdown

When Mater Dei stacked the middle to defend the run, sophomore Matt
Gutierrez passed for 300 yards and six touchdowns at University of
the Pacific
2000
De La Salle 31, Mater Dei 28
In the closest call of the streak, De La Salle's streak survived when
Mater Dei's David New was wide to the left on a 34-yard field-goal
attempt in the final minute at Edison Field
2001
De La Salle 34, Mater Dei 6
Alijah Bradley ran for 206 yards to lead the Spartans to a romp at
University of the Pacific
De La Salle 29, Long Beach Poly 15
Maurice Drew scored four touchdowns at Veterans Stadium in Long Beach
in a battle of teams ranked Nos. 1 and 2 in the nation

<LD>A winner of four of nine in France, Inesperado has improved his win
percentage considerably since arriving in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by 3 Plus U Stable and trained by Bobby Frankel, the
3-year-old son of Zayyani is perfect in three starts, all graded
stakes. He'll try to run his victory streak to four in today's
$150,000 Oak Tree Derby at Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   After beginning his California career with a nose victory over
Regiment in the Cinema Breeders' Cup Handicap on June 30 at Hollywood
Park, Inesperado won twice at Del Mar. He rallied to win despite a
very slow pace in a four-horse field in the La Jolla Handicap, then
came from 10 lengths back to take the Del Mar Derby.</LD>
<TE>   A loser only once in five tries at the Oak Tree Derby distance of
1 1/8 miles, Inesperado is the 9-5 favorite against eight others,
including stablemate Royal Gem. A Royal Academy colt, he has won two
of three on the turf but has been idle since finishing third in the
Forerunner at Keeneland on April 17.</TE>
<TE>   A race before the Oak Tree Derby, Grant Marty A Wish will try to
remain unbeaten in four starts when she moves into allowance company
for the first time. After breaking her maiden against $12,500 foes at
Solano, the Beautiful Crown filly was claimed for that amount by
trainer John Ivory for a partnership and she earned two easy
victories -- and about five times her purchase price -- at Del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Big Score, a 2-year-old Grand Slam filly, will
try for her fourth win in as many starts for trainer Steve Asmussen
in today's $150,000 Astarita at Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Nick Canani. After failing to have a winner at Del Mar,
the trainer won with three of his first six starters at Oak Tree,
including Night Patrol, who took last weekend's Oak Tree Breeders'
Cup Mile.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Rudy Rodriguez. The jockey, based in New York, is one
for 68 in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Sweet Olympio in the
first, using Cease Span and Aetha in the second and Jimmy Z, Earl Of
Danby, Cottage, Jekyll and Hyde and Hotel Hall in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 4/24. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $35/$139.40. Total money bet: $156.</TE>

<LD>One summer, insulted by their contract offer, Luc Robitaille bolts
the Kings, signing with the Detroit Red Wings as a free agent in July
2001.</LD>
<LD>   The next, he returns to his adopted hometown, where he had played
12 seasons, to celebrate a championship won in the Midwest, carrying
the Stanley Cup to Grauman's Chinese Theatre and the Hollywood sign
and parading it through Universal Studios and Dodger Stadium on a
Sunday afternoon in August.</LD>
<LD>   Lording Lord Stanley's Cup over his former employer?</LD>
<TE>   The Kings say no.</TE>
<TE>   "Knowing Luc, he's not the type of guy who would do anything like
that, to slap anyone in the face," captain Mattias Norstrom said.
"It's just not his style. A selected few have the opportunity to take
the Cup home, and for Luc that's L.A."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings said they were happy for Robitaille, who scored 30
goals, tied for third on the team, in helping the Red Wings win their
10th championship.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, for sure," said forward Ian Laperriere,  who watched the
Cup-clinching game on French television at home in Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   "He went to talk to the French journalist on the ice ... and he
just started crying right on TV, didn't know what to say.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the first time I saw Luc speechless. I had goose bumps. I
had tears in my eyes."</TE>

<HD>Kings Again Clip Red Wings</HD>
<DH>Detroit's 3-2 loss at Staples Center leaves defending NHL
champion winless in last eight games here.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Their twice-a-season appearances always draw a large number of their
crimson-clad faithful, but despite the support the Detroit Red Wings
have not fared well in their recent visits to Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Including Saturday night's 3-2 loss to the Kings, they are winless
in their last eight games in the downtown arena, an unseemly run of
ill fortune for the defending Stanley Cup champions that includes
seven consecutive losses.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings kept the streak alive behind Jason Allison, who scored
his first two goals of the season in front of a capacity crowd of
18,177.</LD>
<TE>   "We do get geared up for teams like Detroit," King forward Adam
Deadmarsh said of the streak. "You have to. If you don't, you're
going to get killed."</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings haven't won at Staples Center since April 19, 2000,
when their 3-0 victory completed a four-game sweep of a first-round
playoff series.</TE>
<TE>   They were 0-3 on the road in the Kings' first-round playoff upset
in 2001. Despite an 0-2 record in Los Angeles last season, however,
they rolled up a league-high 116 points and won the Stanley Cup for
the third time in six years.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Hall of Fame coach Scotty Bowman and goaltender Dominik
Hasek retired and captain Steve Yzerman had knee surgery, taking the
inspirational leader out of the lineup until at least January.</TE>
<TE>   But with longtime assistant Dave Lewis taking over behind the
bench and free-agent signee Curtis Joseph in net on Thursday night,
the Red Wings started a season-opening trip with a convincing 6-3
victory over the San Jose Sharks.</TE>
<TE>   "They're the champs and in my book they're still the favorites,"
King forward Ian Laperriere said before the game. "They've still got
Nicklas [Lidstrom, the league's top defenseman] back there and all
those veterans that can chip in....</TE>
<TE>   "It's always fun to play them because you know if you don't show
up you'll get your behind killed."</TE>
<TE>   That was never an issue Saturday as the Kings took the lead on the
game's first shift.</TE>
<TE>   When Brendan Shanahan of the Red Wings attempted to clear the puck
around the end boards, it caromed wildly off the glass to the front
of the goal, where Allison swept it past Joseph 27 seconds into the
game.</TE>
<TE>   "That's just being in the right place at the right time," Allison
said. "I actually was going to go behind the net, but at the last
second I saw it pop out."</TE>
<TE>   Kris Draper pulled the Red Wings even at 13:15, blowing past King
rookie Alexander Frolov and redirecting a pass from Bret Hull, but
the Kings responded by netting two goals in less than three minutes
to make the score 3-1.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Chartrand scored from the slot after taking a pass from
behind the net by Laperriere at 16:22 and then, with Red Wing
defenseman Jiri Fischer in the penalty box serving a double minor for
high-sticking Allison, the Kings scored a power-play goal at 19:09.</TE>
<TE>   Allison, bleeding from a cut lip, pounced on the rebound of a shot
by Jaroslav Modry and scored from the left faceoff circle.</TE>
<TE>   "You get cleaned up at intermission," Allison said later through a
swollen lower lip that required stitches. "Especially on the power
play, you want to make sure we get our first unit out there."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings killed four penalties against the Red Wings before Hull
scored his first goal of the season and 680th of his career as
Allison sat in the penalty box for tripping. The goal cut the deficit
to 3-2 at 5:56 of the third period.</TE>

<LD>With one win apiece, Rail Skimmer and Coolmore will meet for the
third time in tonight's $15,000 Calyx Handicap at 870 yards.</LD>
<LD>   After finishing second, nearly three lengths behind Rail Skimmer

length at 9-2, defeating the 3-10 favorite.</LD>
<TE>   Owned by Ed Allred and trained by Kelly Lewis, Rail Skimmer is the
one to catch in the Calyx and will break from post 6 in the field of
seven, directly inside Coolmore.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the lineup are quarter horses Seeks Joy, Bcr Get Bac
Jac and Azure Classic Star, thoroughbred More Red and appaloosa Sell
Short.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Wayne and Laura Lukas and trained by the latter, Coolmore
has won three of five since being stretched out to 870 yards. He will
be ridden for the first time by Ramon Sanchez.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Finest Ryon. 2. Shescape. 3. Romantic Beduino. 4.
Pennants Headlight. 5. Teller Corona. 6. B. Fabulous. 7. Great Tip.
8. Rail Skimmer. 9. Azuzenas De Amoy.</TE>

<TE>   Shots in the dark: Moms Cashtaker could improve in second time out
in the third for trainer Connie Hall. Romanos Memory debuts in a
pretty soft spot in the fifth.</TE>

<HD>Miami Win Comes Out of Left Field</HD>
<DH>No. 1 Hurricanes win, 28-27, when Beitia adds to Florida
State's litany of field-goal failure in series with miss at :01.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MIAMI -- It is too little for a curse, and way too much for
coincidence.</LD>
<LD>   Florida State quarterback Chris Rix hugged himself tight as he sat
in the locker room, bowing as if in pain.</LD>
<LD>   Another kick had sailed wide Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   Just one more kick in the gut for Florida State.</TE>
<TE>   "It must be something in the air," Rix said.</TE>
<TE>   The only variation in the mind-boggling procession was that Xavier
Beitia's 43-yard field-goal attempt with one second left was wide
left -- not wide right, like the three famous Florida State misses
against the Hurricanes that came before.</TE>
<TE>   Add Beitia's name to the somber roll call: Gerry Thomas in 1991,
Dan Mowrey in 1992, Matt Munyon in 2000--games known in Seminole
history as Wide Right I, II and III.</TE>
<TE>   "I simply can't believe we lost the game like that again," Florida
State Coach Bobby Bowden said after No. 1 Miami escaped with a 28-27
victory after trailing by 13 points in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we had it. I went out to shake his hand. I thought he
hit it. I've had that picture so many times before in my career. I
can't stand it. Our kids did not deserve to lose this game."</TE>
<TE>   The Hurricanes (6-0) can't say they deserved to win. They just
did, extending the nation's longest winning streak to 28 games
despite trailing at halftime for the first time since the streak
began.</TE>
<TE>   Miami quarterback Ken Dorsey couldn't watch Beitia's kick after
leading the Hurricanes back by directing them to two touchdowns in
less than three minutes to take the lead with 5:17 left.</TE>
<TE>   Neither could tight end Kellen Winslow Jr., who let the Orange
Bowl record crowd of 81,927 tell him the news.</TE>
<TE>   "I personally thought he was going to hit it," said Winslow, who
had a breakout game with six catches for 84 yards. "I couldn't watch.
I closed my eyes. Then I heard the majority of the crowd yell, and I
knew we had won."</TE>
<TE>   With that, Beitia -- who made field goals from 45 and 42 yards
earlier in the game -- inherited a place in the Seminole kickers'
circle of pain.</TE>
<TE>   "What was going through my head?" Beitia said in a statement
issued by the school because he was sobbing too much to talk to
reporters. "I was not nervous. I was thinking, 'Just make the kick.
Just make the kick.' The same thing always goes through my head. Was
it a bad snap or a bad hold? I don't know the answer. It was a blur."</TE>
<TE>   Rix, the Seminole quarterback from Santa Margarita High, winced
for his teammate.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel for him," Rix said. "I know if we had it to do again, we'd
want him to do it. The guy kicks 50-, 60-yarders every day in
practice.</TE>
<TE>   "We were one point, one inch from beating the No. 1 team in the
country.</TE>
<TE>   "We showed we can play with the best. We showed what we're capable
of. That we can play with the No. 1 team in the country, and we
should have won."</TE>
<TE>   Ninth-ranked Florida State (5-2) was given little chance of
beating its rival this season and was a 13-point underdog.</TE>
<TE>   But Miami's ballyhooed defensive front crumbled against Florida
State's offensive line, and Seminole running back Greg Jones had 134
yards by halftime in a season in which no back had gained more than
89 on the Hurricanes in a game. He finished with 189 in 31 carries.</TE>
<TE>   The Hurricanes were causing their own problems too.</TE>
<TE>   Blessed with the recovery of a fumbled punt at the Florida State
15 in the first half, the Hurricanes gave it right back when Dorsey
fumbled the exchange on the next play as Miami hurried to the line of
scrimmage, and Florida State recovered.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey's late-game heroics bailed him out of one of his more
dubious performances. He completed 20 of 45 passes for 362 yards but
threw two interceptions -- one at the Florida State six in the first
half, and the other at the Florida State 14 on the first possession
of the second half as the Hurricanes tried to come back from a 17-14
halftime deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Miami committed 14 penalties for 109 yards, including a chop block
that wiped out a 53-yard gain in the third quarter and a personal
foul in the fourth quarter that helped extend the scoring drive that
gave Florida State a 27-14 lead with 11:44 left.</TE>
<TE>   "It just seems like there was always something we did wrong,"
Miami center Brett Romberg said. "We lacked discipline, focus,
excitement."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Larry Coker agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "We made a lot of mistakes. We turned the ball over twice in the
red zone," Coker said. "[But] we never flinched, never gave up."</TE>
<TE>   No, they just came back.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing by 13 with 9 1/2 minutes left, Miami got the ball at the
30 and Dorsey needed a mere 1:22 to direct a 70-yard drive keyed by
passes of 37 and 19 yards to Andre Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Florida State gave the ball back after a five-play drive fizzled
with Rix under pressure.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Dorsey needed only two plays and 19 seconds, connecting
with tailback Willis McGahee on a screen pass that went for 68 yards
to the 11.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Geathers carried the ball in on the next play to tie the
score, and Todd Sievers' extra-point kick gave Miami its first lead
since the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't hold that quarterback down for so long. He's that
darned good," Bowden said. "They made the plays to win the game, but
we still had the last shot."</TE>
<TE>   Incredibly, some of the Miami players said they never saw their
chance of repeating as national champions glimmer.</TE>
<TE>   "I never really thought we were going to lose," Romberg said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just surprised it went wide left instead of wide right."</TE>
<TE>   Bowden watched in disbelief.</TE>
<TE>   Could anyone deserve to lose this way, this many times?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," he said. "I know I don't."</TE>

1-0 win at Columbus last Wednesday and one for a 0-0 tie the previous
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   New England plays for the title next Sunday in Foxboro against the

day before Thanksgiving and in Memphis, Tenn., the day after, and so
Shaquille O'Neal has invited teammates and other members of the

<LD>   The O'Neal estate, in the exclusive Isleworth district of Orlando
shared by Tiger Woods and Ken Griffey Jr., is being expanded from
36,000 to 55,000 square feet, though not for the occasion. He is

instead worked a deal with the New York Knicks for the rights to
forward Nene Hilario.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Robert Horry started at power forward and Soumailia Samake,
O'Neal's choice to become the backup center the Lakers may or may not
choose to afford, started at center in Saturday night's 103-81
exhibition loss to the Denver Nuggets at Oklahoma City.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant had 20 points in 23 minutes. Devean George had 15
points. Samake had a team-high eight rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rick Fox (strained lower back) and Mark Madsen (strained left
hamstring) did not suit up.... The Lakers are off today. Their next
exhibition game is Thursday night at the Arrowhead Pond against the
Golden State Warriors.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Brown</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Point guard Marko Jaric scored seven points and had nine assists
in the Clippers' double-overtime exhibition victory Friday against
the Seattle SuperSonics. Gary Payton, Jaric's counterpart for the
SuperSonics, scored 40 points.</TE>
<TE>   Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry was not at all disappointed in Jaric, a
Yugoslav rookie playing in his first NBA game.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him after the game, 'In my opinion, you played against the
best point guard in the NBA, bar none,' " Gentry said after
Saturday's practice. "I think he sees the talent level you've got to
get to. Obviously, you don't expect him to shut down Gary Payton
right now. It was a great learning experience for him."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry was pleased by the way the Clippers, and Jaric and Andre
Miller in particular, moved the ball. The Clippers had 27 assists on
41 baskets against the SuperSonics. Last season, the Clippers were
23rd among 29 teams in assists.</TE>
<TE>   "That shouldn't happen on a team like this," Gentry said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Elton Brand shot baskets very gingerly Saturday, the first time he
has done so since having arthroscopic surgery on his right knee Sept.
26. He hasn't been cleared to begin workouts but said his knee is
"feeling better."</TE>
<TE>   The initial estimate was that Brand, the Clippers' leading scorer
and rebounder last season, would be out for at least three weeks.
That was adjusted to at least four weeks, but Brand said Saturday,
"I'm ready."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry was more cautious, relying on team doctor Tony Daly's
assessment.</TE>
<TE>   "Elton had his knee looked at the other day and it's really
promising," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers face the Memphis Grizzlies at 6 tonight at Staples
Center.</TE>
<TE>   Elliott Teaford</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento King guard Mike Bibby had surgery on his fractured
right foot Saturday and is expected to be sidelined six to eight
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Knick forward Antonio McDyess injured his left knee in
Saturday's loss to the Phoenix Suns. Surgery on the same knee limited
McDyess to 10 games last season. The initial diagnosis was a
hyperextension, and McDyess was scheduled to undergo an MRI exam late
Saturday night.... Veteran forward Charles Oakley, 38, signed a
one-year contract with the Washington Wizards.</TE>

<KH>ON BASEBALL/ AMERICAN LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES</KH>
<HD>Punchless Twins Look for Great Escape</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The linescore on futility is: 2-3-1-1.</LD>
<LD>   The Minnesota Twins may have escaped the contraction gallows, but
they are being carved up by Angel pitchers.</LD>
<LD>   The above numbers represent seven runs in four games, and it
doesn't take banker owner Carl Pohlad to conclude that's a certain
barometer of deflation.</LD>
<TE>   Put it this way:</TE>
<TE>   The new labor agreement insures the Twins survival through 2006,
but they are about to be eliminated from the American League's
championship series.</TE>
<TE>   It could happen today.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins trail the best-of-seven series three games to one and
must snap the Angels' three-game winning streak today to take it back
to Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   Far from a snap the way they're hitting.</TE>
<TE>   In Game 4, as rookie John Lackey made his first start in 16 days
for the Angels, the Twins collected three hits in seven shutout
innings against Lackey and six hits in all, losing 7-1.</TE>
<TE>   They are now batting .217 against the Angels after winning the
American League Central with a .272 team average, and their Saturday
night clubhouse was a warehouse of varied rationale and bravado.</TE>
<TE>   There was Torii Hunter, for instance, complaining about how the
Angels are getting a lot of bloop hits of the type that are eluding
the Twins.</TE>
<TE>   There was slump-buried leadoff man Jacque Jones blaming himself
for his failure to ignite the offense, and there was Doug
Mientkiewicz saying the Twins have gotten away from their offensive
approach and some of that is because Lackey and the Angel pitchers
have kept them off balance.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got our butts whipped," Mientkiewicz said. "We haven't lost
it, they've taken it, but we've faced elimination before against two
of the best pitchers in the league [Oakland's Mark Mulder and Tim
Hudson] and survived. We have to sleep fast, forget what's happened
and start all over. We can win three in a row just like they have,
but we have to come out loose and crazy. If we can get it to 3-2
we'll feel we have a chance because we'll be going back to the
Metrodome, and everybody knows how tough we are there."</TE>
<TE>   The Twins may know how to get to the Metrodome, but loose and
crazy?</TE>
<TE>   Their desperation had reached such depths in the seventh inning
that Cristian Guzman attempted to drag bunt with two strikes and
missed, becoming one of Lackey's seven strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   That desperation can also be measured by the fact that
Mientkiewicz was saying that his team may have learned a lesson in
the ninth inning when two hits led to the Twins' only run in that "we
were reminded that we just have to go up there relaxed and let it
fly. I think we're all trying to be heroes, trying to get the big
hit, but it's hard to get a clutch hit when there's two out and
nobody on base."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, Mientkiewicz said, there are certain truths about the
Minnesota offense. The Twins were ninth in the league in runs and
eighth in home runs, and generally, he said, they have to go about it
with the same situational approach that the Angels do.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to get 15 hits a game," the first baseman said.
"We know we don't have one of the best offensive teams. Our pitchers
have to pitch their brains out to win, and they have all year. Four
runs shouldn't be too much to ask."</TE>
<TE>   So far, it's one more than the Twins have scored in any of the
four games with the Angels, and Mientkiewicz said he felt especially
sad for ace Brad Radke, who matched Lackey's shutout through six
innings before the Angels scored twice in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Radke has been an Angel nemesis, and this was the game the Twins
thought would get them even in the series, but they credited Lackey's
cut fastball and precise control ("he was always on the corner,"
third baseman Corey Koskie said) and Mientkiewicz added that catcher
Bengie Molina was part of it. "He did a hell of a job keeping us off
balance. Every time we looked inside they threw outside, and every
time we looked outside they threw inside," Mientkiewicz said.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that's a sure sign of a mentally frustrated team.
Consider that All-Star Hunter is batting .214, that Koskie, the No. 3
hitter, set an ALCS record with his sixth consecutive strikeout in
the first inning and that Jones, the leadoff man, is hitting (so to
speak) .059 with one hit in his last 22 postseason at-bats. The Twins
have not homered in the series, have struck out 35 times in four
games and have drawn only five walks.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, the former USC standout, offered a mea culpa.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we need to ... I'll say that I need to do a better job of
jump-starting our offense. I haven't done anything to help our team
win. If anybody needs to be blamed it should be me. I'm the leadoff
hitter. It's my job to get on base and kick-start our offense. I'm
just not doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Well, said Hunter, putting another spin on it, "we're just not as
lucky as those guys. Those guys are getting bloop hits to get them
going and we're not even getting those bloop hits."</TE>
<TE>   Hunter acknowledged that Angel pitchers have done a good job of
preventing hits of any kind, but that it was tough to watch Scott
Spiezio collect a bloop double that scored the second Angel run "when
we can't get that."</TE>
<TE>   Mientkiewicz agreed that Spiezio has found the "Bermuda Triangle
down the first-base line" a couple of times, but then Mientkiewicz
himself greeted the indomitable Francisco Rodriguez with a bloop
double to center to open the eighth, when the score was only 2-0, but
was left stranded as Rodriguez struck out two of the next three
Twins.</TE>
<TE>   "I was determined to get a hit even if they brought Bob Feller out
of the bullpen," Mientkiewicz said.</TE>
<TE>   Who doesn't look like Bob Feller to the Twins?</TE>

<HD>A Man of Stature</HD>
<DH>Goode's numbers crunching has helped Super Bowl teams</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Through five games, the Kansas City Chiefs have the most prolific
offense in franchise history. They have scored a league-high 85
points in the fourth quarter, more than the total points of 11 teams.
Part of that success is due to Trent Green, who has a quarterback
rating of 115.0, best in the league. Part is due to running back
Priest Holmes, who leads the league with 803 yards from scrimmage.</LD>
<LD>   And part is due to Bud Goode, a 79-year-old retired TV executive
from Studio City who has 10 cats and a passion for gardening.</LD>
<LD>   "Bud is phenomenal," said Lynn Stiles, Kansas City's vice
president of football operations. "His intelligence is off the
Richter scale."</LD>
<TE>   For the last 40 years, Goode has used his extensive mathematics
background to collect, analyze and interpret football statistics,
anything to give paying clients the slightest edge. And those clients
pay handsomely; he works for two NFL teams, the Chiefs and
Philadelphia Eagles, and they pay about $20,000 a season for his
services.</TE>
<TE>   Goode (pronounced Goody) and his five business partners crunch
every conceivable statistic to determine which have the greatest
bearing on victories and losses, and what, specifically, teams need
to do to improve.</TE>
<TE>   "We use the same kind of math that Einstein used for the fourth
dimension," Goode said. "The stuff that we do would have required a
supercomputer 15 years ago. Ten years ago, it would have taken a
mainframe. Now, we can do it on a laptop."</TE>
<TE>   Goode, who studied psychology and statistics at Occidental College
and studied psychometrics in graduate school at USC, worked on "The
Art Linkletter Show" from 1957 through '71. He started analyzing
football games in 1960 when Hy Friedman, then the head writer for
Groucho Marx, was starting a computerized service bureau and asked
Goode to help promote it. Goode offered to predict the winner of the
Rose Bowl by studying the statistics of both teams.</TE>
<TE>   The media took notice, and what started as a lark turned into a
second career.</TE>
<TE>   Goode, who is staunchly opposed to gambling, got national
attention in January 1974, when Sports Illustrated asked him to use
his system to pick a Super Bowl winner between Minnesota and Miami.
Tex Maule, the magazine's top pro football writer, picked the Vikings
and wrote an article defending his choice. Goode correctly chose the
Dolphins.</TE>
<TE>   "I just love the intellectual challenge," said Goode, who has had
20 NFL teams as clients at one time or another, 10 of which reached
the Super Bowl with him on the payroll.</TE>
<TE>   One of Goode's partners is Bill Sanders, who has a doctorate in
physical chemistry and says he gets more enjoyment out of reading
line-by-line statistical accounts of football games than watching the
games on TV.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at football the way a theoretical scientist would," said
Sanders, 50. "I try to understand the big picture by looking at
what's going on at the small level."</TE>
<TE>   A fraction of the information they cull is available on their Web
site (www.budgoodesports.com); teams that subscribe to his service
get far more detailed breakdowns in a password-protected area.</TE>
<TE>   The Chiefs download about 60 pages of statistics every week, and
Coach Dick Vermeil, who has used the service since his days with the
Eagles in the 1970s, devours the information and incorporates it into
his coaching.</TE>
<TE>   "It fits Dick's philosophy," said Mike White, Kansas City's
director of football administration, and a former coach of the
Oakland Raiders. "Dick is a statistics nut. He's always looking for
documentation of something he already knows."</TE>
<TE>   Some Bud-isms:</TE>
<TE>   * In general, each running play more than your opponent is worth
one point on the scoreboard.</TE>
<TE>   * Once every five games, something -- a fumble, an interception, a
kickoff or a punt -- is returned for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   * Because 3% to 5% of pass attempts are intercepted, teams that
throw 50 times a game are very likely to have at least one pass
intercepted per game.</TE>
<TE>   * Passing for 300 yards is a vastly overrated accomplishment. More
often than not, a quarterback who reaches that milestone winds up
losing.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, when Vermeil was coaching the St. Louis Rams and
Kurt Warner was an anonymous fill-in for the injured Green, Goode
punched in the numbers after two weeks and discovered a motherboard
of a trend: Warner's yards-per-pass-attempt numbers were through the
roof. He was averaging about 12 yards per attempt--which factors in
incomplete passes and sacks--while the league average was roughly
half that.</TE>
<TE>   Goode called Vermeil and told him, "You're not only going to the
Super Bowl, you're going to win it."</TE>
<TE>   The Rams did wind up winning it, of course, but they were coming
off a 4-12 season. So Goode's message wasn't taken too seriously.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought he belonged in a straitjacket," confessed Stiles, who
has worked alongside Vermeil in Philadelphia, St. Louis and Kansas
City. "But there's obviously value in what he puts together."</TE>
<TE>   Goode doesn't profess to know the coaching nuances of the game --
whether, say, one receiver runs better routes than another, or which
play would work best against a certain defensive front.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first started, Chuck Knox told me, 'Bud, never make the
mistake of telling anyone you know anything about football -- because
you don't,' " Goode recalled with a laugh. "And he was right."</TE>
<TE>   But Knox has been out of coaching for years, and Goode is still
around.</TE>
<TE>   What are the odds?</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mario Lemieux scored his first two goals since late January, Aleksey
Morozov had two goals in the opening six minutes, and the Pittsburgh
Penguins rebounded from their worst opening game loss ever, beating
the New York Rangers, 6-0, Saturday night at Pittsburgh.</LD>
<LD>   Defenseman Dick Tarnstrom, scratched from the Penguins' 6-0 loss
to Toronto on Thursday, had a goal and two assists to help Pittsburgh
open a 4-0 lead with 6:30 left in the first period.</LD>
<LD>   "We worked well together and moved the puck well," Lemieux said.
"Especially after the last game, it was important to get off a quick
start and get the crowd into it and get some confidence."</LD>
<TE>   Jean-Sebastien Aubin, replacing opening-game starter Johan
Hedberg, stopped 30 shots for his first shutout since Feb. 14, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   New York played without Eric Lindros and Pavel Bure. Lindros was
suspended for one game by the league for high sticking Montreal
defenseman Stephane Quintal on Friday. Bure had strep throat.</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver 5, San Jose 3 -- Trent Klatt scored his second goal of
the game with 4:37 left to help the Canucks win their home opener.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose rallied from a two-goal third-period deficit to tie the
score, 3-3.</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo 6, Montreal 1 -- Taylor Pyatt scored twice and Martin
Biron made 19 saves to spoil the Canadiens' home opener.</TE>
<TE>   The Sabres scored all the goals against Jose Theodore, the
league's most valuable player last season.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 2, New York Islanders 1 -- Jaromir Jagr scored a
power-play goal with 4:36 left at Uniondale, N.Y., and the Capitals
won despite taking only 14 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 5, Atlanta 4 -- Olli Jokinen scored off a rebound with
10.2 seconds left in overtime at Atlanta and the Panthers overcame a
hat trick by Shawn McEachern.</TE>
<TE>   The teams skated three on three after penalties five seconds apart
in the extra period.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 2, Toronto 1 -- Petr Schastlivy's power-play goal with 22
seconds left put a damper on the Maple Leafs' home opener.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Lalime made 22 saves for the Senators. Trevor Kidd started
in place of Ed Belfour and made 33 saves for Toronto. Belfour sat out
because of an infected right index finger.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 3, Columbus 2 -- Patrik Elias scored the winning goal
with 7:40 remaining at East Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Sergei Brylin and Mike Danton also scored for New Jersey, which
opened the season with consecutive victories for the first time since
1995.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonton 3, Nashville 2 -- Mike Comrie scored midway through the
third period to lift the Oilers. The Predators failed to win their
first home game for a fifth consecutive season.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 2, St. Louis 2 -- Andrew Brunette scored with 15.4
seconds left in the third period to give the Wild a tie at St. Louis.</TE>

Nikolai Khabibulin made 21 saves at Tampa, Fla.</TE>

with 7:54 left at Phoenix. He has 48 points in 41 games against the
Coyotes.</TE>

<HD>St. Louis Takes Long Way</HD>
<DH>Cardinals hit three home runs to beat Giants, 5-4, for
first win in National League championship series.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- The San Francisco Giants can't blame the St. Louis
Cardinals for beating them Saturday afternoon, 5-4, in Game 3 of the
National League championship series. The Cardinals did all they could
to give the Giants a commanding 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven series.</LD>
<LD>   They froze in the field as if they had gum stuck to their shoes.</LD>
<LD>   They ran into each other.</LD>
<TE>   They fielded poorly.</TE>
<TE>   They surrendered a devastating home run to Barry Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the Cardinals still managed to crawl away from the brink of
elimination and, on three home runs -- by Jim Edmonds, Mike Matheny
and Eli Marrero -- and a bullpen by committee, they eked out a win
over the Giants in front of a deflated Pacific Bell Park sellout
crowd of 42,177.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't play very well," said Steve Kline, a relieved St. Louis
reliever. "We didn't even look as good as the Bad News Bears."</TE>
<TE>   Of course it helped that the Giants played some sloppy ball of
their own and stranded 11 men on base.</TE>
<TE>   "No way could we be down, 3-0, in this series," said Kline.</TE>
<TE>   In the first inning, it seemed inevitable with the opportunities
San Francisco was getting.</TE>
<TE>   Opportunity No. 1: Cardinal shortstop Edgar Renteria made an error
on a routine ground ball by Giant leadoff man Kenny Lofton. Then,
with two out, St. Louis second baseman Fernando Vina failed to cover
second on another routine ground ball to Renteria, allowing the
Giants to load the bases.</TE>
<TE>   But the Giants failed to score.</TE>
<TE>   Opportunity No. 2: In the second inning, with two Giants aboard,
St. Louis starter Chuck Finley stood on the mound, staring at a bunt
laid down by opposing pitcher Russ Ortiz.</TE>
<TE>   That forced first baseman Tino Martinez to come over to the
third-base side to field the ball, but he was too late to get
anybody.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw Tino cut across and I thought he was going to third with
the throw," Finley said, "so I stood out of the way, but that was my
ball."</TE>
<TE>   The Giants got one run across on a sacrifice fly by Rich Aurilia,
but again left the bases loaded.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco had gotten men aboard on four hits, a walk, an error
and a fielder's choice, but scored only once, leaving six men
stranded.</TE>
<TE>   "We just couldn't get that big hit today," Giant Manager Dusty
Baker said.</TE>
<TE>   In the third inning, it was the Giants who were charitable.</TE>
<TE>   Finley struck out, but reached base when Ortiz's pitch got away
from catcher Benito Santiago for a wild pitch. Vina, desperate to
make up for his mental error, hit a long fly to center that glanced
off Lofton's glove. It was generously ruled a double.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals didn't care what it was called. They called it an
opportunity and cashed in when Finley scored on Renteria's sacrifice
fly, and they scored a second time on a groundout by Edmonds.</TE>
<TE>   Matheny's one-out homer to left in the fourth inning and Edmonds'
one-out homer to left in the fifth gave the Cardinals a 4-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   But no lead against the Giants is safe if a pitcher elects to
challenge Bonds, the single-season home run king.</TE>
<TE>   Finley figured he didn't have much choice when Bonds came to bat
in the bottom of the fifth with none out and runners at first and
second.</TE>
<TE>   On a 1-0 count, Finley threw Bonds a fastball.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't even a strike," Finley said. "It was a pitch that I
figured the best he could do was pull it foul."</TE>
<TE>   Wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds hit it straight and long into a blue, cloudless San
Francisco sky. St. Louis right fielder J.D. Drew didn't bother to
run.</TE>
<TE>   The man who finally got his hands on the ball was wearing a blue
windbreaker, sitting in a yellow kayak in McCovey Cove with a fishing
net.</TE>
<TE>   Score tied at 4.</TE>
<TE>   It could have been the ultimate letdown for the Cardinals, but
they didn't have long to agonize.</TE>
<TE>   Marrero led off the sixth with a home run off Jay Witasick into
the left-field bleachers.</TE>
<TE>   How Marrero felt about that is hard to say because he doesn't talk
to reporters. But there is no doubt what it meant to his teammates.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Veres, Kline, Rick White and Jason Isringhausen came out of
the bullpen to hold the Giants scoreless the rest of the way.</TE>
<TE>   Finley got the win and Witasick the loss.</TE>
<TE>   Bad start but a good ending for those Bad News Bears.</TE>

<LD>St. Louis Cardinal second baseman Fernando Vina didn't know what to
say about the first inning of Game 3 Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   With two out and two on, Benito Santiago hit a routine ground ball
to Cardinal shortstop Edgar Renteria. Vina thought Renteria was going
to first, but Renteria, having already begun his motion, threw to
Vina anyway, even though the second baseman was a good seven feet
from the bag. Vina whipped the ball to first, but it was too late to
get Santiago.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought he was going to first," Vina said. "But regardless, I
should have been at second."</LD>
<TE>   Reggie Sanders then hit a fly ball to center. Vina roamed far out
of his area, leaped and missed, but center fielder Jim Edmonds made
the catch to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   "No damage," said a grateful Vina.</TE>

<HD>Irish Get a Lot Out of a Little and Win</HD>
<DH>Pittsburgh dominates play, but No. 8 Notre Dame escapes
with a 14-6 victory and improves to 6-0.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SOUTH BEND, Ind.</DL>
<LD>Notre Dame had only one sustained drive against Pittsburgh. It was
all the No. 8 Irish needed.</LD>
<LD>   That's because the Fighting Irish defense held the Panthers
without a touchdown Saturday despite giving up a season-high 402
yards total offense. The defense sacked Pittsburgh quarterback Rod
Rutherford eight times and forced three turnovers, including one
midway through the fourth quarter that led to a 12-yard touchdown
drive to secure the 14-6 victory by the Irish.</LD>
<LD>   Irish Coach Tyrone Willingham said despite the lopsided statistics
for the Panthers (5-2) he did not think the Irish (6-0) were
outplayed.</LD>
<TE>   "I think the true quality of being outplayed is winning the game,
and I think that happened today," said Willingham, who earned his
50th career victory . "Our guys responded in the manner that a good
team has to respond."</TE>
<TE>   Rutherford said the key was clutch plays.</TE>
<TE>   "We found a way to lose and they found a way to win," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish got more than half their offense on their first drive of
the second quarter, an 80-yard drive capped by Carlyle Holiday's
11-yard touchdown pass to Arnaz Battle.</TE>
<TE>   The Fighting Irish produced only one more touchdown -- in the
fourth quarter, when Ryan Grant scored on a one-yard run after the
Irish defense forced a turnover at the Pittsburgh 12.</TE>
<TE>   It was the eighth time the Irish had scored a touchdown that was
set up by their defense.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is what they have been living on is turnovers,
and that was the difference in the game," Pittsburgh Coach Walt
Harris said. "Turnovers were devastating."</TE>
<TE>   The Panthers, ranked eighth in the nation in defense, limited
Notre Dame to a season-low 185 yards. The Irish had only 40 yards
rushing in 32 carries and 10 first downs.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame's only drive longer than 36 yards was the
second-quarter possession engineered by Holiday.</TE>
<TE>   The loss was only the second in 13 games for the Panthers, who
fell short of posting their best start since Dan Marino was a senior
in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   Harris said he doesn't take much solace in the fact the Panthers
played so well. "There's no moral victories. We lost," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The 20 points scored are the fewest scored at Notre Dame Stadium
since Pittsburgh defeated the Irish, 10-9, in 1986 in Lou Holtz's
first year as coach.</TE>

<LD>What does the following combination of words mean to you?</LD>
<LD>   Long-underachieving local team.</LD>
<LD>   Playoffs.</LD>
<TE>   Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   If you're under 35: "Cool. Got an extra ticket to today's Angel
game?"</TE>
<TE>   If you're over 35: Unprintable blood-curdling scream as you go
sprinting from the room and friends hold you back as you try to hurl
yourself through the upstairs plate-glass window.</TE>
<TE>   Long before Twins-at-Angels was a novel way to spend an October
weekend in 2002, Vikings-versus-Rams was a wretched way to ruin
Christmas holidays if you grew up in the Los Angeles area and rooted
for the home NFL team in the late '60s and '70s.</TE>
<TE>   Including a 1988 wild-card game at the Metrodome, the Los Angeles
Rams played the Minnesota Vikings six times in the playoffs, going
1-5, which pretty much explains why Chuck Knox never made it to the
Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams' lone playoff victory over Minnesota, at home in 1978,
merely delayed the agony another week, when they lost the NFC title
game, at home, to the Dallas Cowboys, 28-0.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels would do well to study this dire stretch of Los Angeles
football history closely, because the hard lessons learned by the
Rams then could prove very useful today.</TE>
<TE>   Watch out for knuckleballs: Joe Kapp never threw a spiral in his
entire NFL career, but his wobblers and end-over-enders rally the
Vikings from a 17-7 halftime deficit in 1969 to a 23-20 victory over
the Rams, who began the season 11-0 and never won again. Team that
broke the winning streak in November? The Vikings.</TE>
<TE>   Remember, it's a game of inches: Down, 7-3, in the third quarter
of the 1974 NFC final in Minnesota, the Rams drive 98 yards and are
six inches away from taking the lead ... when guard Tom Mack is
mysteriously flagged for illegal motion. Moved back five yards, Ram
quarterback James Harris throws an interception in the end zone on
the next play. Mack was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame
in 1999, still convinced he never moved on the controversial play.
The '74 Vikings went on to beat the Rams, 14-10, and lose Super Bowl
IX.</TE>
<TE>   Be adaptable: Angel Manager Mike Scioscia has learned there are
times to bring in closer Troy Percival earlier than the ninth inning.
Knox, however, was fatefully stubborn in adhering to the conservative
strategy that got him to his third consecutive NFC final in 1976. So
on fourth and goal inside the Minnesota one-yard line in the first
quarter, Knox sends on the field-goal unit. The Vikings block the
kick, Bobby Bryant scoops up the ball and returns it 90 yards for a
touchdown, sparking a 24-13 Minnesota victory.</TE>
<TE>   Home-field advantage can be overrated: The 1977 Rams figure they
are due as they finally get to play host to the Vikings in a playoff
game. Of course, Minnesota weather follows the Vikings west and a
Southern California rainstorm turns the Coliseum field into a
quagmire. Ram quarterback Pat Haden has trouble gripping the slippery
football and throws three interceptions. Vikings win, 14-7.</TE>
<TE>   Beware the Metrodome: Already the Angels have won a playoff game
inside the Metrodome, which is more than the Rams can say. The Rams
ventured back to Minnesota in 1988, long after Kapp and Fran
Tarkenton and Chuck Foreman had retired. The ghosts, however, never
vacate. Jim Everett goes 19 for 45 and throws three interceptions.
Vikings win, 28-17.</TE>
<TE>   Six years after that, the Rams were gone, headed for St. Louis.
Which explains why there is so much local hope and interest
surrounding this playoff against Minnesota. It's an October Sunday in
the Southland. The Twins and the Angels have the place all to
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Chasing History</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of the Rams, who are 0-5 this season and down to
third-stringer Marc Bulger as their starting quarterback against 4-0
Oakland today: This could be a team for the ages.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding the strike season of 1987, the Rams are the first team
to go from the Super Bowl one season to 0-5 the next. If 0-6 happens,
as is widely expected, the Rams will have to finish 5-5 to avoid the
worst post-Super Bowl season in league history.</TE>
<TE>   Record holders: the 1999 Atlanta Falcons and 1990 Denver Broncos,
who each went 5-11 a season after reaching the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   In the pre-Super Bowl era, the New York Giants went from the NFL
championship game in 1963 to 2-10-2 in 1964.</TE>
<TE>   Realignment Realignment</TE>
<TE>   How the NFL's new-look divisions rank at the season's
first-quarter mark:</TE>
<TE>   1. AFC West: Four playoff-caliber teams dueling for one fewer
wild-card spot than in previous seasons. The Raiders are the league's
last unbeaten team, the Chargers and the Broncos are 4-1 and the
Chiefs, with the NFL's leading rusher, Priest Holmes, and the
second-highest scoring offense, are in last place at 3-2.</TE>
<TE>   2. AFC East: The Patriots are defending the title, the Dolphins
have a rushing game and Drew Bledsoe is playing like an MVP contender
with the Bills. The Jets don't know what hit them.</TE>
<TE>   3. NFC South: The Saints and the Buccaneers could meet in the NFC
final. Carolina is decent again. The Falcons are an unlucky 1-3,
unluckier still if Michael Vick's shoulder injury keeps him out for
more than one week.</TE>
<TE>   4. NFC East: At 3-2, the Giants are overachieving. At 3-2, the
Eagles are underachieving. Redskin Coach Steve Spurrier believes he
has found his quarterback in Patrick Ramsey. Cowboy Coach Dave Campo
wishes he could say the same about Quincy Carter.</TE>
<TE>   5. AFC South: The Colts are 3-1, largely because Tony Dungy has
cut the team's points-allowed average in half. The Jaguars are 3-1,
largely because Fred Taylor is back in the lineup. Houston's new
team, the Texans, is pretty much what everyone expected. Except, at
1-3, they're half a game ahead of Houston's old team, the 1-4 Titans.</TE>
<TE>   6. NFC North: The old "Black and Blue Division" has gone
distinctly green and gold. Five games in, the Packers already have a
two-game lead over the Bears, who need more interception returns by
Mike Brown. Today, the Vikings play host to the Lions. Somewhere,
someone cares.</TE>
<TE>   7. NFC West: Has cannonballed in status along with the 0-5 Rams.
San Francisco should win the division in a walk. (No pun intended,
Barry Bonds fans.)</TE>
<TE>   8. AFC North: Chris Redman, starting quarterback for the
first-place Ravens (2-2). In a division that includes the luckless
Browns and the hopeless Bengals, no wonder the 1-3 Steelers are
optimistic.</TE>

<HD>Demise of Texas Is Upon Simms, Brown Again</HD>
<DH>Longhorns' quarterback, coach lose third in a row to
Oklahoma, which stays in national race with 35-24 win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>DALLAS -- It started out as Texas-OU but ended up, once again, as
Texas-"Oh No."</LD>
<LD>   You almost feel guilty watching, the way you do slowing down at
the scene of an accident.</LD>
<LD>   You wonder how much disappointment the Texas coach can take, and
how many times he can answer postgame questions for his quarterback,
and how many nitroglycerin patches one Texas official can go through
to control his heart condition.</LD>
<TE>   Oklahoma spotted Texas an early lead Saturday before a wave of
kickoffs and karma led to a 35-24 victory before a Cotton Bowl crowd
of 75,587.</TE>
<TE>   The game had the usual implications, huge, with Texas again coming
out on the short end.</TE>
<TE>   No. 2 Oklahoma improved to 6-0 to keep pace with No. 1 Miami,
while No. 3 Texas (5-1) has to fight its way back into national
contention.</TE>
<TE>   It was Oklahoma's third straight win over Texas and extended the
saga for Longhorn Coach Mack Brown and senior quarterback Chris
Simms.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma Coach Bob Stoops said afterward, "I'm not one to say we
have anyone's number" about his team's recent run against Texas, but
there were plenty of long Longhorn faces in the Texas student section
that suggested otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Mack Brown, Texas' fifth-year coach, returns to Austin a loser in
another big game while Simms' record fell to 0-5 against top 10
opponents. In those games, he has 15 interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   He has become the Peyton Manning of his time, a great-guy,
big-armed, future NFL draft choice who can't get past his nemesis.
While at Tennessee, Manning could never beat Florida, while Simms
will now leave Texas cursing Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if anyone in this room wanted to win this game more
than me," Simms said afterward.</TE>
<TE>   As he left the field, Oklahoma fans taunted him with chants of
"Chrissy" while one held up a placard that kept a running total of
Simms' statistics.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, as he did after last year's 14-3 loss to Oklahoma, said
this wasn't the story of two tortured characters.</TE>
<TE>   "This has nothing to do with Chris and I," Brown said, "it's about
the team. Anytime you lose to Oklahoma, it's disappointing. We're
both big guys, we can handle whatever comes."</TE>
<TE>   In the latest chapter of Texas hexes, the Longhorns jumped to a
14-3 lead when Rod Babers intercepted a second-quarter Nate Hybl pass
and returned it 73 yards for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   But Oklahoma put a quick stop to the momentum when Antwone Savage
returned the kickoff 81 yards, setting up the game's pivotal plays.</TE>
<TE>   Facing fourth and three at the Texas nine, Oklahoma decided to go
for the first down and succeeded when Longhorn defensive end Bryan
Pickryl was baited into jumping offside.</TE>
<TE>   That led to Hybl's three-yard scoring pass to Trent Smith with 10
seconds left, and the Sooners made a two-point conversion, leaving
Texas with a halftime lead of only 14-11.</TE>
<TE>   "Those were some major plays in the game," Stoops said.</TE>
<TE>   Texas kicked a third-quarter field goal to extend the lead to
17-11, but Oklahoma then went on a 24-0 run that buried the
Longhorns.</TE>
<TE>   The turning point came with five seconds left in the third
quarter, when linebacker Teddy Lehman intercepted a tipped Simms pass
and returned it to the Texas 38.</TE>
<TE>   Lehman? Yeah, he's the same guy who victimized Simms last year,
returning a pass tipped by Roy Williams for a touchdown to clinch the
win.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what it is," Lehman said. "Every time there's a
batted ball, I'm standing there."</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma's good fortune didn't end there.</TE>
<TE>   After the Sooners drove inside the Texas 10, receiver Will Peoples
fumbled after receiving a short Hybl pass near the goal line, but the
ball bounced right into the hands of Quentin Griffin, who ran two
yards for the touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   That gave Oklahoma its first lead, 21-17, and seemed to foretell
Texas' fate.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll take all the Sooner magic I can get," Stoops said of the
play. "Sprinkle it here, sprinkle it there."</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma made it 28-17 on Kejuan Jones' two-yard touchdown run
with 6:41 left, and Griffin pushed the lead to 35-17 with 3:02 left
on his scoring run.</TE>
<TE>   Griffin finished with 248 yards in 32 carries, averaging 7.8 yards
per carry.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma began the day ranked only 63rd nationally in rushing and
had minus-23 yards in an early-season win over Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   With Saturday's win, Oklahoma stays on national-championship
course while Texas must regroup.</TE>
<TE>   Brown wouldn't let Simms answer a question about the quarterback's
woes against top-10 competition.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got big games the rest of the year, and he'll play well,"
Brown said. "That was his response."</TE>
<TE>   In a question he was allowed to answer, Simms said, "It was a
horribly disappointing game, it's one game and it's a long season.
We've got to keep our heads up and get ready for a long year."</TE>
<TE>   Brown correctly noted the season is not over. Last year, after the
Oklahoma loss, Texas raced all the way to the Big 12 title game and
would have earned a spot in the Rose Bowl against Miami had it
defeated Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what we've got to do," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   Again.</TE>

<TE>   Top 10 Reasons Simms Isn't a Prime-Time Player</TE>
<TE>   Texas quarterback Chris Simms continued to struggle in big games
Saturday, losing for the fifth consecutive time against a top 10
team. He has 15 interceptions in those games. A look:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oct. 7, 2000</TE>
<TE>   No. 10 Oklahoma 63,</TE>
<TE>   No. 11 Texas 14</TE>
<TE>   Simms is 11 for 23 for 63 yards and has an interception returned
41 yards for a touchdown by the Sooners' Rocky Calmus. With the
Longhorns trailing, 35-0, Major Applewhite replaces the sophomore.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dec. 29, 2000</TE>
<TE>   No. 8 Oregon 35,</TE>
<TE>   No. 12 Texas 30</TE>
<TE>   Simms is 17 for 34 for 245 yards but throws four interceptions in
a Holiday Bowl loss. "He's tough as nails, he's a real competitor.
This game will really help him out," Longhorn Coach Mack Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oct. 6, 2001</TE>
<TE>   No. 3 Oklahoma 14,</TE>
<TE>   No. 5 Texas 3</TE>
<TE>   The Longhorn offense never gets rolling as Simms is 24 for 42 for
198 yards. He throws four interceptions, including one that is
returned two yards by Teddy Lehman for a Sooner touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dec. 1, 2001</TE>
<TE>   No. 9 Colorado 39,</TE>
<TE>   No. 3 Texas 37</TE>
<TE>   With a berth in the Rose Bowl and a right to play for the national
title on the line, Simms throws three interceptions and fumbles once
as the Buffaloes charge to a 29-10 lead before Applewhite engineers a
comeback. Simms is nine for 17 for 130 yards.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oct. 12, 2002</TE>
<TE>   No. 2 Oklahoma 35,</TE>
<TE>   No. 3 Texas 24</TE>
<TE>   Simms is 12 for 26 for 156 yards with three interceptions and four
sacks, including one on the game's final play.</TE>

<HD>If Only Twins Could Get Back to Dome</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Twins need a dose of that special mausoleum magic found only in
the cold concrete of the Metrodome. But the way they're going, the
next time they visit the Dome it will be to pack up their toiletries
and spare socks for the winter.</LD>
<LD>   If they can win today, they will bring the series back to
Minnesota. And as we all know, that would be a very bad thing for the
Disney Angels. But to win today the Twins need to do an about-face.
First and foremost, they need to start hitting the baseball.</LD>
<LD>   "They won three in a row, so can we," said Doug Mientkiewicz.
"It's not out of the realm of possibility."</LD>
<TE>   Yet it is out of the realm of probability if the Twins don't hit
better. They also need to catch the ball better, pitch better out of
the bullpen and not botch any more hit-and-run signs.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what to tell you," said Corey Koskie.</TE>
<TE>   Poor Koskie, the mighty Canadian lumberjack who eats 100 flapjacks
and then clears an entire forest by lunchtime, is swinging like a
rusty gate. David Ortiz unfortunately has given new meaning to his
nickname "the Big O." Jacque Jones is like a human ceiling fan,
creating a major breeze at the plate three or four times a night.</TE>
<TE>   One more poor showing and the Twins will allow Mr. Bud Selig to
breathe a huge sigh of relief. He will not have to present that
championship trophy in Minnesota after all.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody seemed sure when the team left for Anaheim after Game 2
that they would be back. I don't think anyone even considered the
possibility of a three-game sweep in California.</TE>
<TE>   Is it over? Does Selig wriggle off the hook? Does Carl Pohlad
crawl back into his vault until the ballpark debate heats up again?
Or will the Twins fend off elimination one more time and get the
series back to a wild and crazy Metrodome? Tune in.</TE>

<HD>Williams Delivers Goods in Time for Washington</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reggie Williams thought it was just an ordinary day. His performance,
though, was extraordinary.</LD>
<LD>   Williams caught three touchdown passes, including the game-winner
on an 80-yard play from Cody Pickett with 2 minutes 3 seconds left,
as No. 22 Washington defeated Arizona, 32-28, on Saturday at Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   "Nothing spectacular," Williams insisted.</LD>
<TE>   Some might beg to differ.</TE>
<TE>   Williams caught eight passes for 184 yards and the Huskies (4-2
overall, 1-1 conference) rallied for the third consecutive year to
defeat Arizona and came back from a loss last week to California that
ended their 17-game home winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   "Just about anytime, magic can happen with this offense,"
Washington linebacker Ben Mahdavi said. "They've got so many weapons.
It's always fun to watch Reggie. It's fun to watch all of our guys."</TE>
<TE>   The Huskies, trailing 28-26, forced a punt and took over at their
own 20-yard line with 2:20 left. On the second play, Williams slipped
under the Arizona defense, caught an eight-yard pass from Pickett and
outran Clay Hardt and Sean Keel down the left sideline.</TE>
<TE>   "Just before that, I told everybody things were going to be all
right," Williams said. "It was an audible, and I just caught a little
slant. Then I got past two guys and it was only me and No. 33. And
there was no way he was going to catch me."</TE>
<TE>   Pickett completed 25 of 35 passes for 345 yards without an
interception, leading Washington in a shootout against Arizona's
Jason Johnson, who was 29 of 41 for 443 yards and three TDs.</TE>
<TE>   It was a highlight-reel display by standout receivers for both
teams.</TE>
<TE>   The Wildcats (3-3, 0-2) got 10 catches for 155 yards from Bobby
Wade and nine catches for 142 yards by Andrae Thurman. But they
couldn't prevent Arizona from losing to Washington for the seventh
time in eight games.</TE>
<TE>   The Wildcats didn't have leading rusher Clarence Farmer, out
because of torn knee ligaments. Safety Jarvie Worcester broke his
right arm in the third and center Keoki Fraser went out in the fourth
with an undisclosed injury.</TE>
<TE>   No. 12 Washington State 36, Stanford 11 -- Jason Gesser passed for
297 yards and threw two of his three touchdown passes to Jonathan
Smith as the Cougars (6-1, 3-0) defeated the Cardinal (1-4, 0-2) at
Palo Alto.</TE>
<TE>   Jerome Riley had nine receptions for 173 yards and a score as
Washington State rolled to its fourth consecutive victory. After
completing 17 of 23 passes despite sore ribs, Gesser sat out most of
the fourth quarter in the Cougars' biggest victory over Stanford
since 1961.</TE>
<TE>   Jermaine Green rushed for a 42-yard touchdown less than four
minutes into the game, bowling over Cardinal safety Colin Branch in
an appropriate image for Washington State's overwhelming performance.</TE>
<TE>   The Cougars led 23-0 at halftime and Stanford never threatened.</TE>
<TE>   Jason David had two interceptions for the Cougars, whose defense
was markedly improved after giving up 93 points in their last three
games.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State 13, Oregon State 9 -- The Sun Devils (5-2, 2-0)
sacked Derek Anderson seven times for 75 yards, including the last
two plays of the game, as they held off the Beavers (4-3, 0-3) at
Tempe, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson also was intercepted three times as the Beavers lost
their seventh in a row to the Sun Devils and 15th straight at Tempe.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Barth, who missed four field goals a week ago, missed a
28-yarder and had a 53-yard attempt blocked, but he made a
career-long 50-yarder and another from 46 yards for the Sun Devils.</TE>
<TE>   The Beavers nearly pulled it out after Anderson connected with
Steven Jackson on a 28-yard play on fourth and seven at the Oregon
State 48. The Beavers moved to the 9, but Anderson's pass was
deflected, then he was sacked twice and the Sun Devils escaped.</TE>

<LD>The sky swirled above center field in pools of orange and black. The
wind was creeping and chilled.</LD>
<LD>   The inning was the seventh. The score was tied at zero.</LD>
<LD>   The date was October 12.</LD>
<TE>   Happy, horrific anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   Two outs from the Angels' first World Series appearance, leading,
5-2, in the ninth inning, Mike Witt gives up a two-run homer to Don
Baylor....</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Saturday was that day.</TE>
<TE>   The 16th anniversary of a loss that ruined a team, jinxed an
organization, maybe even killed a man.</TE>
<TE>   Did you remember? Did you feel it?</TE>
<TE>   When the Angels took the field against the Minnesota Twins for
Game 4 of the American League championship series, they were gently
accompanied by the ghosts of the 1986 Angel team that blew Game 5 of
this same series to the Boston Red Sox.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in the seventh inning, those ghosts surrounded them.</TE>
<TE>   One out from their first World Series appearance, Gary Lucas
enters the game and hits Rich Gedman with his first pitch....</TE>
<TE>   These Angels say they never think about the past. After they
defeated the New York Yankees last weekend for the first playoff
series victory in club history, everyone wrote that the past had been
buried.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe not quite.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the Angels still needed to survive days like Saturday, when
they struggled scorelessly against Twin starter Brad Radke before
putting runners on first and third with none out in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe they needed to overcome what happened next.</TE>
<TE>   When Garret Anderson popped up the first pitch to third base for
an out.</TE>
<TE>   Just as Doug DeCinces did with bases loaded in the ninth inning 16
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Still one out away, Donnie Moore allows a two-run homer to Dave
Henderson to give Boston a 6-5 lead....</TE>
<TE>   Ben Weber was talking about 1986.</TE>
<TE>   "I bet you half the people in the clubhouse never heard of Donnie
Moore," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Being the honest sort, he then shook his head.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, OK, of course we've heard of him, it's impossible not to
hear of him," he admitted.</TE>
<TE>   But there is a difference between hearing, and listening.</TE>
<TE>   Seventh inning, one out, the Angels showed again how all this
history stuff goes in one red earhole and out the other.</TE>
<TE>   Because stepping to the plate after Anderson was Troy Glaus.</TE>
<TE>   A man who once used DeCinces as an agent and dated his daughter.</TE>
<TE>   A man who lined a fastball to left field to score the game's first
run, giving the Angels a lead they would never lose in a 7-1 victory.</TE>
<TE>   It would be wonderfully ironic, if it wasn't so doggone weird.</TE>
<TE>   Moore allows an 11th-inning sacrifice fly to Henderson that gives
the Red Sox an eventual 7-6 victory ....</TE>
<TE>   In the top of the eighth Saturday, with the Angels leading, 2-0,
there was one more obstacle.</TE>
<TE>   Remember when Witt was replaced by Gary Lucas despite retiring the
last batter he faced? Well, John Lackey was replaced by Francisco
Rodriguez despite retiring his last batter.</TE>
<TE>   And, while Lucas hit a batter, Rodriguez hit a bat. He allowed
Doug Mientkiewicz to knock a blooper that fell out of diving Darin
Erstad's glove in center field for a double.</TE>
<TE>   At which point, I did a terrible thing, but I couldn't help it.
The roaring racket and palpable drama lifted me to my feet and over
to Tim Mead, the Angels' classy, long-suffering vice president who
has endured it all.</TE>
<TE>   "Know what today is?" I asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," he said, smiling. "Known it all day."</TE>
<TE>   "A little worried right now?" I asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Different time," he said, still smiling. "Different team."</TE>
<TE>   And how.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez blew away the next three hitters, not allowing another
ball to leave the infield.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the Twins batted in the ninth, when the memories of
Moore would have been even greater, the Angels had scored five more
runs and made the entire thing irrelevant.</TE>
<TE>   And today the Angels lead the AL championship series three games
to one, which will have more people talking because that was their
lead before that fateful day in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   But now that they've survived the Yankees and survived the
anniversary, does anybody really believe they can't survive this?</TE>
<TE>   "I swear, I didn't know that today was the anniversary, that's the
first I've heard of it," said Joe Maddon, the longtime Angel coach
and one of three people in the clubhouse who was around in 1986.
"Honestly, that has nothing to do with now."</TE>
<TE>   Honestly, I think we finally believe him.</TE>
<TE>   "I was horsebleep," says Moore after the loss, which sends the
series back to Boston, where the Angels lose the next two games and
are eliminated. Two years later, Donnie Moore commits suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Sixteen years ago Saturday, horses with mounted police were
paraded onto the field in the ninth inning for the celebration that
never happened.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, for the first time since then, horses were paraded
again. Only this time, they waited until after the final out.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>FIRST INNING</LD>
<LD>   TWINS: Twins 0, Angels 0--Jacque Jones flied to right. Cristian
Guzman grounded to short. Corey Koskie struck out swinging. He has
struck out in six straight at-bats. He's like Rob Deer's clone,
without the homers. No runs, no hits.</LD>
<LD>   ANGELS: Twins 0, Angels 0--David Eckstein struck out swinging.
That was a short at-bat. Darin Erstad struck out swinging on a ball
he would have needed a telephone pole to reach. Tim Salmon grounded
to third. No runs, no hits.</LD>
<TE>   SECOND INNING</TE>
<TE>   TWINS: Twins 0, Angels 0--David Ortiz struck out swinging. Torii
Hunter popped to first. Doug Mientkiewicz grounded to second.
Somebody call Don Larsen. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 0, Twins 0--Garret Anderson grounded to short. Troy
Glaus popped to shallow center. Brad Fullmer struck out swinging. No
runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   THIRD INNING</TE>
<TE>   TWINS: Angels 0, Twins 0--Dustan Mohr hit a broken-bat single to
left-center. A.J. Pierzynski grounded to second. Adam Kennedy bobbled
the ball and was only able to get the force at second. Luis Rivas
batting. Pierzynski was thrown out attempting to steal. Someone
missed the hit-and-run sign. And the way Pierzynski reacted, it must
have been Rivas. Rivas singled to left. Jones lined to first. No
runs, two hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 0, Twins 0--Scott Spiezio popped to short. Bengie
Molina popped to second. The crowd at Edison Field is overflowing
with Rally Monkeys, and Fox is showing all of them. Jane Goodall must
be in heaven. Adam Kennedy grounded to short. Here's an idea for the
Twins: Have Charlton Heston throw out the first pitch in Game 6 (if
you make it that far) and let him say his classic "Planet of the
Apes" line: "Take your paws off me.... " No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   FOURTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   TWINS: Angels 0, Twins 0--Guzman grounded to first, pitcher
covering. John Travolta is in the stands. Give my best to Horshack.
Koskie hit a looper that was caught by Eckstein. Ortiz struck out
swinging. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 0, Twins 0--Eckstein singled to right. Erstad flied
to left. Salmon popped to shallow right, Rivas making a great play by
holding onto the ball while Mohr ran into him and knocked him down.
Anderson grounded to short. No runs, one hit, one left.</TE>
<TE>   FIFTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   TWINS: Angels 0, Twins 0--Hunter grounded to second, pitcher
covering. Mientkiewicz, whose name is also the eye chart at several
optometry offices, grounded to short. Mohr struck out swinging. No
runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 0, Twins 0--Glaus lined to second. Fullmer flied
out to the right-field fence. It looked like every ball hit by Eric
Karros this season. Spiezio was jammed and grounded to third. No
runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   SIXTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   TWINS: Angels 0, Twins 0--Pierzynski grounded to second. Rivas hit
a slow bouncer up the middle, Kennedy making a nice play to throw him
out. Fox Instapoll: "If you had the money, which team would you buy?"
If I had the money, I'd buy Fox and hire some cameramen who knew
something about baseball. Could we cut off the fielder's glove in
every shot? It's nice not being able to tell where the ball is going.
Jones struck out swinging. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 0, Twins 0--Molina singled to center. Kennedy
sacrificed. Eckstein lined to second, Rivas threw to Guzman and
doubled Molina off second. Poor baserunning by Molina. No runs, no
hits.</TE>
<TE>   SEVENTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   TWINS: Angels 0, Twins 0--Guzman struck out attempting to bunt for
a hit. Koskie struck out -- again -- looking. Ortiz singled to
center. Hunter grounded to short. Eckstein looks as though he is
straining himself even on those short throws to second. It reminds me
of the good ol' days when Billy Barty would play during Hollywood
Stars night at Dodger Stadium. No runs, one hit, one left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 2, Twins 0--Erstad singled to center. Salmon
batting. Erstad stole second and took third when the throw bounced
into center. Salmon walked. Anderson swung at the first pitch and
popped to third. Nice at-bat. Did Doug DeCinces tell you to do that?
Glaus singled to left, Erstad scoring, Salmon to second. Alex Ochoa
ran for Salmon. Fullmer struck out. There's a kid in a really bad
monkey suit jumping up and down in the stands behind home plate. It
looks like a low-budget version of "Return of the Jedi." Remember,
children are our future. Spiezio hit a blooper that landed just
inside the right-field line for a double, Ochoa scoring, Glaus to
third. Molina was hit by a pitch. Johan Santana pitching. Kennedy
grounded to first. Two runs, three hits, three left.</TE>
<TE>   EIGHTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   TWINS: Angels 2, Twins 0--Francisco Rodriguez pitching. Ochoa in
right. Mientkiewicz doubled on a blooper to center that Erstad was
unable to come up with despite a great effort. Mohr struck out
swinging. Pierzynski grounded to second, Mientkiewicz to third. Bobby
Kielty, batting for Rivas, struck out swinging. This Rodriguez kid
might have a future in this game. No runs, one hit, one left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 7, Twins 0--David Lamb at second. Eckstein popped
to first. Erstad singled to left-center. Erstad took second on a bad
pickoff throw. Why does Erstad's helmet come off when he runs? Maybe
he knocks it off on purpose so it looks like he's running fast.
That's an old Pete Rose trick. LaTroy Hawkins pitching. Ochoa
grounded to short, Erstad to third. J.C. Romero pitching. Anderson
singled to right, Erstad scoring. Mike Jackson pitching. Ron
Gardenhire changes pitchers more often than Tony La Russa. Glaus
singled to left. Fullmer doubled to right, Anderson and Glaus
scoring. Those pitching moves really paid off. Spiezio was walked
intentionally. Molina tripled to center, Fullmer and Spiezio scoring.
Bob Wells pitching. Do the Twins have any other pitchers they can
bring in? Where's Terry Felton? Kennedy struck out looking. Five
runs, five hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   NINTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   TWINS: Angels 7, Twins 0--Ben Weber pitching. Jones lined to
short. Guzman grounded to second. Koskie doubled to center. Ortiz
singled to right, Koskie scoring. Hunter struck out swinging. One
run, two hits, one left.</TE>

<HD>Margarito Stands Up, Holds Off Perez</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Choosing to fight a guy who knocked you down once before might be a
dicey proposition, especially if it's for your first title defense.</LD>
<LD>   But World Boxing Organization welterweight champion Antonio
Margarito had a plan and executed it to near perfection against Danny
Perez Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   Margarito (27-3) dominated Perez (27-3) with a relentless
performance that earned him a unanimous decision, winning every round
on two of the three judges' scorecards in front of 3,141 at the
Arrowhead Pond.</LD>
<TE>   "We knew from the first fight that he had a strong right hand and
we wanted to stay away from it," said Margarito, who survived a
first-round knockdown in their June 12, 1999, fight at Indio and
rallied to win a split decision.</TE>
<TE>   "He had that strong right hand and a decent left hook, but that
was it."</TE>
<TE>   Margarito, of Tijuana, won the vacant WBO belt with a 10th-round
stoppage of Antonio Diaz in March and wants to unify the title by
meeting either World Boxing Assn. 147-pound champion Ricardo Mayorga
or World Boxing Council titlist Vernon Forrest.</TE>
<TE>   In the semi-main event, WBA flyweight champ Eric Morel remained
undefeated by successfully defending his title in stopping No.
1-ranked Dankaosaen Kaowichit in the 11th round.</TE>
<TE>   Morel (32-0, 18 knockouts) was dominating the later rounds and
knocked Kaowichit (20-1) down twice in the round, the second time
with two left hooks and a right cross, which sent Kaowichit sprawling
and prompting referee Raul Caiz to call it off at 1:40 of the round.</TE>
<TE>   "Speed was the key for the victory," said Morel, who was born in
Puerto Rico but now lives in Madison, Wis., and was making his fifth
title defense.</TE>
<TE>   Also on the card: Huntington Beach light heavyweight Julio
Gonzalez stopped Thomas Reid in the third round, referee David
Mendoza stopping the bout at the 2:15 mark as Gonzalez (31-1, 21
KO's) pounded away on Reid (29-10-1) against the ropes.</TE>

<KH>Diane Pucin/ AMERICAN LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES</KH>
<HD>Two Young Pitchers Compose a Symphony</HD>

<LD>John Lackey, a 23-year-old Texan of uncommon composure and unlimited
competitiveness, handed off the baseball to 20-year-old Francisco
Rodriguez, a stone-faced youngster from Venezuela who, said Ben
Weber, "is way more composed than I am," and who hasn't been in the
big leagues a month.</LD>
<LD>   As Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said, a casual fan might have
thought this was a triple-A baseball game.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't.</LD>
<TE>   This was Game 4 of the American League championship series, a
pivotal game because the Minnesota Twins had their ace, their go-to
guy, their sure thing, their Angel killer, Brad Radke, up to pitch.
And the Angels had Lackey, who joined the big league rotation June
30.</TE>
<TE>   All he's done since is post a 9-4 record. His first start at home,
against Dodger ace Odalis Perez, he won, 5-1. He was the winning
pitcher in the Angels' AL wild-card clincher, beating Texas Sept. 26
after Anaheim had squandered four other chances to earn its first
playoff spot since 1986.</TE>
<TE>   And Saturday night, in front of red mayhem, with the "experts"
predicting that this was the Twins' game, that Radke was going to
even the series, that the 29-year-old veteran and his 11-4 lifetime
record and 1.72 ERA against the Angels, his 6-1 record and 1.38 ERA
at Edison Field, were going to bury the excitable Lackey, Lackey was
an equal to Radke.</TE>
<TE>   "John's a competitor," Angel pitching coach Bud Black said. "Yeah,
John probably heard some of that stuff. It didn't bother him. It just
made him compete harder."</TE>
<TE>   Pitch for pitch, Lackey matched Radke for six innings.</TE>
<TE>   Right away, Lackey was sharp. He threw 10 pitches in the first
inning, got a fly out to left, a ground out to short and got Corey
Koskie to strike out for the sixth straight time.</TE>
<TE>   "That was big for me," Lackey said, "getting out of the first
inning so easily. It set a tone."</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe the tone was set in New York eight days ago when, as
Black said, "John got his feet wet in the playoffs and learned he
could do it."</TE>
<TE>   It was Game 3 of the division series against the Yankees and Ramon
Ortiz was getting hammered. Lackey came in, the Angels were already
losing, 4-1, and Lackey gave up two quick singles to Nick Johnson and
Juan Rivera. Two more runs scored, Ortiz's responsibility, but Lackey
still felt culpable. "That made me mad," he said, and he retired nine
of the next 10 Yankees he faced over three innings.</TE>
<TE>   Lackey didn't let another run score and he gave his hot-hitting
teammates a chance to chip away at the lead. The Angels came back to
win, 9-6. "And I learned a lot," Lackey said. "I learned in the
playoffs that every single pitch counts. I came into a situation
where I couldn't give up any more runs. It was that way tonight. The
way Brad was throwing, it was pretty clear that every single pitch
counted."</TE>
<TE>   Behind every pitch Lackey threw Saturday, there was a purpose. He
wanted to establish his fastball first. Then he worked in his curve.
"He even threw a couple of great changeups to left-handers," Black
said. "We've been working on that and trying to get him to do that."</TE>
<TE>   In seven innings Lackey never let a runner get past first base. He
gave up three hits, no walks, had seven strikeouts, gave up no runs.
And that was good because for six innings Radke was equally good.</TE>
<TE>   "That was fun," Lackey said. "Going pitch-for-pitch against a guy
like Radke. This is where I want to be. Going against the best. You
can measure yourself. You can see where you're at."</TE>
<TE>   And where that? "I think I've got a shot to help this ball club."</TE>
<TE>   There's an attitude to love. Lackey was grinning, a devilish
little smile. Yes, he knows he's good. It's fun to be good.</TE>
<TE>   After the Angels finally scored, in the bottom of the seventh,
Lackey stepped aside for Rodriguez. By now the Edison Field crowd is
all in a lather when the young folk hero comes in from the bullpen.
Rodriguez stares straight ahead, takes the ball and fires.</TE>
<TE>   He gave up a leadoff bloop double to Doug Mientkiewicz, then
sandwiched a ground out to second between two strikeouts. Perfect
again, creating a playoff legend pitch by pitch. When might reality,
and some batters, hit Rodriguez?</TE>
<TE>   "Never, I think," bullpen coach Bobby Ramos said. "Really, I
believe that right now. Never."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia, a child of the Dodger organization, a former catcher who
appreciates the talent, both physical and mental, of great pitchers,
spoke with deep feeling about his rookie throwers, Lackey and
Rodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   "I was fortunate enough to have always worked with a great
pitching staff," Scioscia said. "In the Dodger organization,
everything was pitching. You see a young guy like I experienced,
Bobby Welch or Fernando Valenzuela or Orel Hershiser, these guys had
the same ice water in their veins that Lackey does and Rodriguez
does."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to compare myself to any of those guys," Lackey
said. "It's way too early for that." The perfect attitude again.
Humility.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year Ramos christened his bullpen the No-Name
Defense. "I went to high school in Miami when the Dolphins had the
No-Name Defense," Ramos said. "I told Bud at the start of the season
that our bullpen was as good as the No-Name Defense. We were going to
be unstoppable."</TE>
<TE>   A touch of bravado, a dash of humbleness, a whole lot of talent.
That's pitching the Angel way, a good way that's taking a team a long
way.</TE>

<HD>Title Talk Begins for Georgia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After 20 years of disappointment, Georgia has that championship
feeling again.</LD>
<LD>   The sixth-ranked Bulldogs remained the only unbeaten team in the
Southeastern Conference, building a comfortable lead and then holding
up against a comeback attempt to beat No. 10 Tennessee, 18-13,
Saturday at Athens, Ga.</LD>
<LD>   "We set some lofty goals at the beginning of the season, and we're
still in position to reach those goals," offensive tackle Jon
Stinchcomb said. "We want to win championships."</LD>
<TE>   Georgia (6-0, 3-0 in conference) hasn't won a conference
championship since 1982, the last of three straight conference titles
with Herschel Walker in the backfield. Since then, it's been nothing
but frustration.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee (4-2, 1-2) had to go without starting quarterback Casey
Clausen, sidelined with a shoulder injury. Third-string freshman
James Banks went most of the way, replacing C.J. Leak on the third
series of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee used a relatively conservative game plan -- 40 rushes
and 19 passes attempted -- but came up with enough big plays to get
back into the game. Tennessee had nearly half of its 344 yards in the
fourth quarter, when Banks completed six of six passes for 145 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia built its lead to 18-0 in the third quarter, but Tennessee
scored two touchdowns in the fourth quarter to make it close. Derrick
Tinsley scored on a 33-yard screen-pass play and Banks' 45-yard
completion to Kelley Washington helped set up a five-yard halfback
option touchdown pass by Tinsley to Jason Witten.</TE>
<TE>   But Georgia recovered an onside kick, and Tony Milton broke off a
25-yard run on fourth and two to clinch the victory with 1 1/2
minutes remaining.</TE>
<TE>   No. 18 Louisiana State 36, No. 16 Florida 7 -- The Tigers
intercepted Rex Grossman four times and got their first win at
Gainesville, Fla. since 1986. LSU scored touchdowns on an
interception return, a fake field goal and two passes from Matt Mauck
to Devery Henderson.</TE>
<TE>   The victory put the Tigers (5-1, 2-0), defending conference
champions, into a first-place tie in the SEC West with Mississippi,
the team that defeated the Gators (4-3, 2-2) last week.</TE>
<TE>   Corey Webster intercepted Grossman twice, and returned the second
one 45 yards for a touchdown and a 10-0 lead late in the first
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas 38, No. 24 Auburn 17 -- Fred Talley ran for 241 yards,
including an 80-yard touchdown run, as Arkansas (3-2, 1-2) gained 426
yards rushing to win at Auburn, Ala. Talley subbed for an injured
Cedric Cobbs, out with a toe injury, and helped Arkansas to its first
400-yard rushing game since gaining 412 against LSU in 1994. Talley
had only 123 yards rushing in the first four games and gained 179
yards in the first half. Auburn is 4-2, 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   No. 25 Mississippi 52, Arkansas State 17 -- Eli Manning threw for
290 yards and three touchdowns to lead the Rebels (5-1) at Oxford,
Miss. The Rebels didn't punt--though they did commit four
turnovers--and outgained the Indians (4-4), 508-264.</TE>
<TE>   Manning was 14 of 19 with an interception and tied the school
record for career touchdown passes with 43, sharing the mark with
Romaro Miller. Manning's father, Archie, threw 31 touchdowns in his
career at Ole Miss.</TE>
<TE>   South Carolina 16, Kentucky 12 -- Ryan Brewer scored on a six-yard
run with 7:54 left and South Carolina's defense held on in the
closing minutes to preserve the victory at Lexington, Ky.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing 16-10 after Brewer's touchdown run, the Wildcats drove to
the South Carolina 7 before the drive stalled with a fourth-and-goal
pass from the six falling incomplete in the end zone. Kentucky (4-2,
0-2) got the ball back in the final minute, after South Carolina
(5-2, 3-1) took a safety with its punter stepping out of the end
zone, but a desperation pass from the South Carolina 34 was batted
down in the end zone as time expired.</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi State 11, Troy State 8 -- Fred Reid ran for a
career-high 111 yards and scored Mississippi State's only touchdown
on a 15-yard pass from Kevin Fant as the Bulldogs won at Starkville,
Miss. The victory was Mississippi State's first against a Division
I-A team this season. The only other victory for the Bulldogs (2-4)
this season came against I-AA Jacksonville State.</TE>
<TE>   Troy State is 2-5.</TE>
<TE>   Middle Tennessee 21, Vanderbilt 20 -- Dwone Hicks had a two-yard
touchdown run with 52 seconds left and ReShard Lee rushed for 144
yards in 20 carries to lift the Blue Raiders (1-5) at Nashville.
Vanderbilt is 1-5.</TE>

<LD>Most of us already know deep down America's pastime is a total bore,
which is why everyone shows up late for Dodger games and leaves
early, or doesn't make an appearance at all when the Angels aren't
playing over their heads.</LD>
<LD>   Baseball is fun for an inning or two, but without beer, hot dogs
or a couch to fall asleep on, it's a drag.</LD>
<LD>   Now that we're into playoff baseball and the Angels have everyone
hyped, a lot of people are making the noble attempt to watch an
entire game in one sitting, which can be a painful experience --
especially when presented by Fox.</LD>
<TE>   Fox has taken it upon itself to fill every dead second between
pitches with something, which means we're seeing something other than
baseball for 2 hours and 38 minutes in a 2-hour and 49-minute game.</TE>
<TE>   The Rally Monkey, for example, has made 368 appearances in the
last two days, while we've seen Brad Fullmer come to the plate four
times.</TE>
<TE>   In the third inning alone Saturday, the Monkey dominated the
telecast with Fox digging deep to tell us the Rally Monkey "throws:
both"; "swings: trees"; and his "favorite band" is the Monkees. It's
pretty clear Fox is angling to make the Rally Monkey its next
"American Idol."</TE>
<TE>   Now most homes don't come equipped with air sickness bags, but Fox
continued the nonsense by presenting us with "Rally Monkey
Etiquette."</TE>
<TE>   That still wasn't enough for Fox's broadcasting duo, who bantered
on and on about the toy as if it was the third member in the booth --
this after one of them had taken a Thunder Stick and banged it over
the head of the other. I checked when the game was over, but Fox did
not list Tom Arnold as a director for the broadcast.</TE>
<TE>   To fill dead air, Fox has provided the expert analysis of Steve
Lyons, who told us after the camera found a stuffed monkey sitting
atop a fan's head, "That Rally Monkey was looking like he was having
a good time."</TE>
<TE>   I don't know about you, but I had trouble buying anything he had
to say after that.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MUCH OF Fox's broadcast is punctuated by the sound effects of
racing cars as Fox goes from replay to replay, which I imagine is
Fox's way of subconsciously reminding everyone it also televises auto
racing.</TE>
<TE>   And when something does happen in the game, my gosh, it sounds
like the Daytona 500 as we're given replay after
replay--whoosh-whoosh-whoosh. On Friday night the umpire called a
ball down the left-field line foul, but Fox gave us 97 replays --
remember this is the network of jiggling excess (Jillian Barberie,
for example) --suggesting the ball might have sent a piece of white
grass flying into the air, which would have made it a fair ball.</TE>
<TE>   Lyons, our expert analyst, said, "Is that a white piece of grass?"
and then quickly added, "The umpire who made the call is one of the
best umpires in the game." He certainly wasn't that wishy-washy when
discussing the Rally Monkey earlier.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FROM FOX'S viewpoint, the fans have become as big as the game with
the camera dwelling on them, so it would be interesting to see how
they would broadcast an Angel game in May when no one is here.</TE>
<TE>   When Friday night's game came to a stop, the Fox cameras took us
behind the rocks and waterfall in center field with broadcaster Thom
Brennaman, who is top-notch at calling the game, telling us, "It's
almost like going to Disneyland." Lyons' added analysis: "Almost."</TE>
<TE>   With so few runs being scored the last two days, Fox filled time
with the Radio Shack Quiz, the Fox Double Box, the Pepsi Fan Cam, and
the PCS Vision vote quiz: "Which do you prefer, the Rally Monkey or
Homer Hankies?"</TE>
<TE>   Now the problem is, I know people who probably gave that question
a great deal of thought; I just wish I could tell you which way Bubba
I, Bubba II and Bubba III voted. I'd imagine it's the only quiz any
of the brothers-in-law ever passed.</TE>
<TE>   For added diversion, the camera sought out celebrities, spotting
David Hasselhoff of "Baywatch." That was breaking news; I had no idea
he was out of rehab.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN THE game gets late and it is close, Fox is at its worst.
Between each pitch, the camera will dart between batter, Angel
manager, Twin manager, a fan with her hands in front of her face, the
Rally Monkey jumping up, the pitcher's eyes, some guy in the dugout
biting his nails, the Rally Monkey landing, a fan with a Christmas
tree on her head, a kid screaming. Ball one.</TE>
<TE>   Now just imagine a three-and-two count.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IN THE seventh inning, some kid dressed in a full monkey suit, and
I have my suspicions it was Frankie Muniz ("Malcolm in the Middle"),
was jumping up and down behind the Twins' dugout, and the Fox cameras
couldn't get enough of him. Don't be surprised if Terry Bradshaw
shows up on the Fox football set today dressed in the same outfit.
That's known as cross-promotion.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels romped, of course, and the Rally Monkey probably has
won a spot on "Celebrity Bootcamp," joining Kato Kaelin as a
household name. Now there's no telling what Fox will do to capitalize
on this when the World Series begins.</TE>
<TE>   I wouldn't rule out every fan in attendance being urged to dress
in full monkey regalia, giving Edison Field that "Planet of the Apes"
kind of feel, which should set the table nicely for Tim McCarver's
nonstop chatter.</TE>
<TE>   That's right, we haven't even heard McCarver yet.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Jennifer H.:</TE>
<TE>   "Why do they allow you on the USC campus?"</TE>
<TE>   To perfect the Trojans' kicking game. Next stop: UCLA.</TE>

<LD>European champion France returned Saturday to the scene of its
greatest triumph--the Stade de France outside Paris where it won the
World Cup in 1998--and immediately put all the failures of 2002
behind it.</LD>
<LD>   Two goals by Steve Marlet and one apiece by Patrick Viera, Sylvain
Wiltord and Sidney Govou earned the French a convincing 5-0 victory
over Slovenia in front of a crowd of 77,619 to begin defense of the
European title they won in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   The match featured the 100th international appearance by France's
captain, defender Marcel Desailly.</LD>
<TE>   "It was important for the [team's] confidence to snatch a success
of this kind," said France Coach Jacques Santini. "The new players
and the old ones are getting to know each other.... Obviously, we
have taken a great step toward our goal [of remaining European
champion]. But there is still a long way to go."</TE>
<TE>   The game was one of 20 qualifying matches Saturday for the 2004
European Championship in Portugal, and all five of the continent's
powers that were playing came through unscathed.</TE>
<TE>   Battered, but unscathed.</TE>
<TE>   England, for instance, had to rely on second-half goals by David
Beckham and Michael Owen to overcome Slovakia, 2-1, in Bratislava,
where two English fans were shot and wounded by security guards in a
pregame incident outside a bar. And police had to resort to baton
charges to subdue English fans intent on attacking Slovak fans who
were aiming racist taunts at England players Emile Heskey and Ashley
Cole, both of whom are black.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to kick [racism] out of the game, but it seems to
have come back in," Beckham said.</TE>
<TE>   England Coach Sven Goran Eriksson also criticized the minority of
Slovak fans involved and said he supports the recent crackdown on
racism by UEFA, European soccer's governing body.</TE>
<TE>   "I agree 100% with UEFA, who are doing everything possible to
fight against that," the Swede said. "In the year 2002, it shouldn't
be possible, and I know about that because I come from a club [Lazio
in Italy] where we had that problem, unfortunately. We tried [to
stamp it out] but it was difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Turkey, which finished third at Korea/Japan '02 and now ranks
among Europe's elite, had to come from behind to win, beating
Macedonia, 2-1, in Skopje, Macedonia.</TE>
<TE>   The home team took the lead in the second minute on a goal by
Vlatko Grozdanoski and should have scored more, but the Turks,
inspired by goalkeeper Rustu Recber, fought their way back and tied
it on Okan Buruk's goal and won it on a goal by Nihat Kahveci.</TE>
<TE>   Italy was not quite as fortunate. It, too, came from behind but
managed only a 1-1 tie against Yugoslavia in front of 50,000 in
Naples.</TE>
<TE>   The Yugoslavs took a surprise lead on a counterattack in the 27th
minute, with Predrag Mijatovic steering the ball past goalkeeper
Gianluigi Buffon, who later kept the Italians in the match with a
series of fine saves.</TE>
<TE>   Alessandro Del Piero tied it 11 minutes later on a 25-yard free
kick that deflected off the defensive wall.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't create space for ourselves to attack," said Italy Coach
Giovanni Trapattoni. "They played well on the counterattack, they
pressed us, and whenever we went forward we left spaces behind us."</TE>
<TE>   Spain, meanwhile, had no such difficulty as it rolled over
Northern Ireland, 3-0, in Albacete, Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Two goals by Ruben Baraja and one by Guti were ample proof of
Spanish dominance.</TE>
<TE>   There were a few upsets among the continent's lesser teams.</TE>
<TE>   Poland, for instance, was beaten, 1-0, in Warsaw by Latvia, which
got its goal on a 20-yard shot by Juris Laizans.</TE>
<TE>   "We did not take advantage of two or three great scoring
opportunities, played nervously and too often as individuals, not a
team," said Poland Coach Zbigniew Boniek. "This unfortunate result
complicates our group, which is very evenly matched."</TE>
<TE>   Romania also was upset at home, losing, 1-0, to Norway on an
84th-minute goal by midfielder Steffen Iversen in the wind and mud in
Bucharest.</TE>
<TE>   "We got more than we originally expected," said Norway Coach Nils
Johan Semb. "We came here for one point and managed to get the
maximum."</TE>
<TE>   Gica Popescu, Romania's captain, explained the loss this way: "We
played against two very strong opponents -- Norway and the damned
pitch."</TE>
<TE>   It was the electricity that was the problem elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   The lights went out in Georgia, or more specifically, at
Lokomotivo Stadium in Tibilisi, and as a result Georgia's game
against Russia was abandoned at halftime with the score 0-0 when the
power failed for the second time. The match will be rescheduled.</TE>
<TE>   Other results went as expected, with Scotland finally giving Coach
Berti Vogts a victory when it shut out Iceland, 2-0, in Reykjavik on
goals by Christian Dailly and Gary Naysmith.</TE>
<TE>   Portugal Unimpressive</TE>
<TE>   Portugal, which qualifies automatically for Euro 2004 as the host
nation, looked in less than top form when it was held to a 1-1 tie by
Tunisia in Lisbon on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The Portuguese scored early, with Pauleta finding the back of the
net after four minutes, but the North Africans, in their first game
under former France coach Roger Lemerre, tied the score three minutes
before halftime on an Ali Zitouni goal.</TE>
<TE>   Fluid Answers</TE>
<TE>   Interesting to see the remark made the other day by former German
international Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, now the chairman of Bayern
Munich.</TE>
<TE>   Commenting after Bayern's Brazilian striker Elber had his driver's
license suspended for a month when he was found with a blood-alcohol
level of 0.5 grams per liter, Rummenigge said Elber would not be
fined and had a question for reporters.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you know what 0.5 is?" he asked. "Everybody in this stadium
has that."</TE>
<TE>   Masked Men</TE>
<TE>   There is no concealing the fact that South American soccer is a
bit different, no matter what sort of masks it dons.</TE>
<TE>   In Bolivia last week, Carlos Ramaciotti, the coach of Argentina's
Gimnasia La Plata, provoked an uproar when he made his players wear
surgical masks while training for a Copa Sudamerica game against
Bolivar to be played in the world's highest capital, La Paz.</TE>
<TE>   Ramaciotti said he wanted the players to be familiar with the
"drowning sensation" they would feel when playing at 12,001 feet in
the Andes. The Bolivians took this as an insult and Bolivar took it
out on Gimnasia, winning, 4-1.</TE>
<TE>   In nearby Ecuador, meanwhile, there is the strange case of Otalino
Tenorio. It seems that whenever he scores a goal for his club team,
Emelec, Tenorio delights fans by racing along the sideline wearing a
Spiderman mask that he keeps stuffed inside his shorts.</TE>
<TE>   No further comment is needed.</TE>

<KH>TWIN NOTES/ AMERICAN LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES</KH>
<HD>Pitching Changes Equal a Record</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jason Reid and Mike Hiserman</AU>
<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Twins used five pitchers in the Angels' five-run eighth inning,
matching an American League championship series record.</LD>
<LD>   Left-hander Johan Santana started the inning, then Manager Ron
Gardenhire went to right-hander LaTroy Hawkins, then back to a
left-hander, J.C. Romero, then to right-handers Mike Jackson and Bob
Wells before the inning mercifully ended with the Angels getting five
hits and having batted around.</LD>
<LD>   So what was the problem? Gardenhire took the blame himself.</LD>
<TE>   "We had all the matchups, it looked like," he said. "What I tried
to get done in the last inning never got there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gardenhire met Twin General Manager Terry Ryan when they were with
the New York Mets in the early 1980s, Gardenhire then an
overachieving utility infielder and Ryan a high-ranking scout.</TE>
<TE>   Their relationship grew after they joined the Twins, Ryan becoming
the club's scouting director in 1986 and Gardenhire a minor league
manager in '88 after retiring as a player.</TE>
<TE>   Other talented teams have collapsed under the weight of horrible
general manager-manager relationships, but the Twins' top officials
are doing just fine.</TE>
<TE>   "He treats people with respect," Gardenhire said of Ryan. "He
knows the game, he works very, very hard at it, and he's given me
this opportunity. He's believed in me and we have a great
relationship."</TE>
<TE>   Ryan does not try to do Gardenhire's job, instead letting the
first-year manager manage.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't want any input into who's going to pitch, who's going
to DH," Gardenhire said. "Once we decide on the team, that's my job
to do the lineup. That's what a manager needs.</TE>
<TE>   "I've asked him many times, 'What do you think?' He's says,
'That's not my department.' That's pretty good for a general
manager."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Joe Mays plans to stick with what worked.</TE>
<TE>   The right-hander baffled the Angels with a sharp changeup in a
Game 1 victory, giving up four hits and an unearned run in eight
innings, and he hopes to do it again today in Game 5 of the American
League championship series at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a power pitcher; there's no chance," Mays said. "I'm a
finesse guy. I've got to change speeds, throw the ball over the plate
and give the defense a chance."</TE>
<TE>   He did that in his first start in this series, benefiting from
good scouting reports.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gardenhire made a change in right field in Game 3, starting Dustan
Mohr instead of rookie Michael Cuddyer, who misplayed two balls in
Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   Mohr, the Twins' best right fielder, was back in the lineup for
Game 4.</TE>
<TE>   "Michael Cuddyer's done very well for us, he's swinging the bat
good," Gardenhire said. "But I want to make sure we have our best
defense out there catching the ball. Any time you make a mistake
right now ... it ends up costing you."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Twin fans are known for waving their Homer Hankies and pumping up
the volume in the Metrodome.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' red-clad supporters made their presence known in Games
3 and 4, annoying the Twins by banging Thunder Stix.</TE>
<TE>   "Those things that they're banging can get very irritating, but
I'm sure our hankies get irritating too," Gardenhire said. "We just
wanted a bunch of pins to start popping them. It's actually really
cool to sit in the dugout, look up in the stands and watch the people
standing and cheering. That's what the game's all about."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Twins said Game 3 starter Eric Milton would start Game 7, if
necessary.</TE>

<HD>Radke Loses His Way for a Change</HD>
<DH>Pitcher's 6 2/3 strong innings against an Angel team he
usually dominates don't end well for the on-the-brink Twins.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jason Reid</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brad Radke did what he usually does when the Minnesota Twins are in
trouble and need a helping hand.</LD>
<LD>   This time, though, their top starter needed to do more.</LD>
<LD>   He needed to be unflappable, needed to be inspiring and definitely
needed to outpitch Angel rookie right-hander John Lackey with the
Twins drowning in a sea of red in the American League championship
series.</LD>
<TE>   Radke pitched well but didn't fulfill the Twins' enormous needs
Saturday night in a 7-1 loss in Game 4 before another Thunder
Stix-banging crowd of 44,830 at Edison Field, contributing to making
the Twins' situation even more uncomfortable.</TE>
<TE>   "I did all I could but it was a tough ballgame," he said. "It's
just been tough for us."</TE>
<TE>   Especially now.</TE>
<TE>   Radke took the loss despite working 6 2/3 strong innings against a
club he has dominated throughout his eight-year career, having the
misfortune of opposing Lackey on the wrong night. The right-hander
made a mistake to Troy Glaus, whose single provided the first run in
a two-run seventh, but was mostly hurt by more well-placed Angel
bloopers.</TE>
<TE>   The scoreless pitching duel over and Radke off the mound, the
Angels broke the game open with five runs in the eighth against the
bullpen, putting the Twins on the wrong end of a 3-1 deficit in the
best-of-seven series.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins sidestepped the ax of contraction en route to winning
the AL Central championship and a division series over the favored
Oakland Athletics, but Radke couldn't stop them from moving to the
brink of a different unfortunate ending.</TE>
<TE>   "Brad Radke was outstanding," Minnesota Manager Ron Gardenhire
said. "I mean, their hits were bloops. They got one solid hit; Glaus
hit a solid ball. They were blooping balls that were falling in for
runs."</TE>
<TE>   Radke gave the Twins a chance, mixing sharp fastballs, changeups
and cut-fastballs, matching Lackey through six innings in a ballpark
as comfortable for him as the Metrodome. In 18 career starts against
the Angels, Radke is 11-4 with a 1.72 earned-run average overall,
including 6-1 with a 1.38 ERA at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   He was also 2-0 with a 1.54 ERA in Minnesota's AL division series
victory over Oakland, so the Twins handed the ball to the right guy
with time running out in the championship series.</TE>
<TE>   "You kind of hope that's the feeling, but that's the game of
baseball," said Radke, who gave up five hits. "Things don't always
work out like you want."</TE>
<TE>   They did for the Twins until the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Radke came out in a groove, retiring the side in the first three
innings, giving up only singles to leadoff batter David Eckstein and
No. 8 batter Bengie Molina through six innings. The seventh unraveled
quickly for Radke and the Twins after Darin Erstad's leadoff single.</TE>
<TE>   With Tim Salmon batting, Erstad stole second and went to third on
catcher A.J. Pierzynski's throwing error, scoring on Glaus' one-out
single. With two-out, Scott Spiezio blooped a run-scoring double just
inside the right-field line. After hitting Molina with a pitch, Radke
was finished.</TE>
<TE>   "Lackey pitched great, and maybe I could have made a better pitch
to Glaus or something," he said. "It was a fastball in, pretty good
pitch, but he's a good hitter. Other than that, nothing much else I
could have done."</TE>
<TE>   The Twins agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "He did what he needed to do to keep us in the game, but we scored
one run [Friday] and one run [Saturday]," left fielder Jacque Jones
said. "He did his job."</TE>
<TE>   And now the Twins need their biggest boost yet.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel bad, we all feel bad, that we didn't do better for Radke,"
center fielder Torii Hunter said. "He went out there and pitched
[well], he goes out there and keeps us in the game for seven innings,
and we couldn't come through for him. That's just the way it's been
for us."</TE>
<TE>   The final chapter of their familiar story could be written today.</TE>

<HD>UCLA Is Sent to Boot Hill</HD>
<DH>Dysfunctional kicking game is the Bruins' undoing in a
31-30 loss to seventh-ranked Oregon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The kick was straight and true, a direct hit. Unfortunately for UCLA,
it wasn't a football that was sent flying.</LD>
<LD>   Sprinting toward the Rose Bowl tunnel the moment the game ended,
Bruin cornerback Ricky Manning ripped into a red pylon with his right
foot.</LD>
<LD>   It was an act of supreme frustration. And it was about the only
kick that went well for UCLA all day.</LD>
<TE>   Chris Griffith had an extra-point try blocked in the third quarter
and missed a 46-yard field-goal attempt with 1:54 to play, allowing
Oregon to escape with a 31-30 victory Saturday before 68,882 in a
game that had more footnotes than a doctoral dissertation.</TE>
<TE>   The ending was eerily similar to last season's 21-20 Oregon
victory, when Griffith missed a 50-yarder on the last play. The
difference this time was that UCLA rolled up 477 yards and had
numerous chances to win.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, the Bruins felt like kicking themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, had they tried ...</TE>
<TE>   "We missed our chance," Manning said. "We not only missed the last
kick, we missed a lot of other opportunities. There's no way we
should have lost that game. They were not the better team."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe not. Maybe they are lucky Ducks. But it was the 11th
consecutive victory for No. 7 Oregon (6-0), which is 2-0 in its quest
to win a third consecutive Pacific 10 Conference championship.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the feats of Craig Bragg (nine catches for 230 yards and
three touchdowns), Tab Perry (seven catches, 126 years, one
touchdown) and Tyler Ebell (119 yards rushing), UCLA (4-2, 1-1)
allowed victory to slip from its fingers--or more appropriately, its
toes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed in several aspects of the kicking game," said
Bruin Coach Bob Toledo, who made several questionable decisions
involving special teams.</TE>
<TE>   The margin of victory was the blocked PAT kick following a
touchdown that enabled UCLA to bounce back to take a 30-24 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Griffith, a senior, had not missed a PAT in more than two years,
making 80 in a row, but this one was so low that Oregon lineman
Haloti Ngata blocked it without jumping or penetrating into the
backfield.</TE>
<TE>   "I was surprised it was blocked," Bruin guard Eyoseph Efseaff
said. "He went straight up and swatted it."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA drove to the Oregon 28 on its next possession, and
Griffith--who had made a 37-yard field goal early in the third
quarter--lined up for a 45-yarder on fourth and 15 that could have
extended the Bruin lead to nine points.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo called a fake, however, and holder Garrett Lepisto rolled
right and completed a pass to Marcedes Lewis -- for eight yards,
allowing Oregon to take over on downs.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he could make it," Toledo said. "If they don't cover
[Lewis], he doesn't get tackled."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruin defense held and it appeared Oregon would have to punt.
But a third-down incomplete pass was nullified because officials
ruled the third quarter ended before the snap.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks turned in the other direction, replayed the down and
scored on a 75-yard pass play from Jason Fife to Keenan Howry for a
31-30 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "What a fluke play," Bruin defensive coordinator Phil Snow said.
"[Manning] jammed Howry, then Fife bounced outside and Howry kicked
away and got open."</TE>
<TE>   On its next possession, UCLA drove from its 20 to the Oregon 27
but quarterback Cory Paus, who was sacked four times and threw three
interceptions, was called for intentional grounding, moving the ball
back to the 35 and out of Griffith's range.</TE>
<TE>   Nate Fikse attempted a pooch punt, but the ball rolled into the
end zone. It wasn't the only errant kick by Fikse, who was under
orders to punt away from Howry. But into Howry's hands the ball went
midway through the second quarter, and into the open field he ran,
sprinting untouched 79 yards to the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't even the most frustrating play for UCLA in the half.
On the last play Oregon's Jared Siegel kicked a 59-yard field
goal--equaling the longest ever in a Pac-10 game.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA defenders were so surprised the Ducks elected to try the
field goal that they appeared frozen in place, not applying a rush
and allowing the low-trajectory kick to clear the line of scrimmage
and send Oregon to the locker room ahead, 24-21.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought they were coming out in their offense," Manning said.
"Then when their field-goal unit came out, we were worried about a
fake."</TE>
<TE>   The third quarter was UCLA's chance to seize control. Perry opened
the period with a 38-yard kick return and the Bruins drove to the
Oregon 14 before settling for Griffith's field goal.</TE>
<TE>   Four minutes later Bragg made asensational one-handed grab of a
middle screen in full stride and raced 46 yards for a touchdown that
put UCLA ahead, 30-24. But Griffith missed the extra point and every
opportunity thereafter was squandered.</TE>
<TE>   The UCLA defense played well, shrugging off the absence of injured
tackle Rodney Leisle. The Bruins drummed Fife, sacking the junior
quarterback four times and forcing him to scramble repeatedly.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon tailback Onterrio Smith rushed for 152 yards in 25 carries
for his sixth consecutive 100-yard effort, but he never scored and
seemed to tire in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins came out strong, scoring on their first offensive play,
a 55-yard bomb from Paus to Perry. Oregon answered with a 17-yard
pass from Fife to tight end George Wrighster, but UCLA made another
big play before the first quarter ended, scoring on a 53-yard pass
from receiver Jon Dubravac to Bragg.</TE>
<TE>   And in the third quarter Paus, who passed for 316 yards, connected
with Bragg for a 71-yard touchdown</TE>
<TE>   "We made enough plays to win but we beat ourselves," Manning said.
"When we lined up for that last field goal, I thought, 'He's going to
nail it. This is cake.' "</TE>
<TE>   Instead, it was deja vu. Comparisons to last year's game were
inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   "This feels even worse," said Bragg, who became only the second
UCLA player with 200 yards receiving in a game.</TE>
<TE>   "If they'd have blown us out it wouldn't feel this bad. But we
made plays, a lot of plays. We needed to make one more."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO THE GAME</TE>
<TE>   Steve Henson's keys to the game and how the Bruins measured up:</TE>
<TE>   1. The depleted Bruin defensive line must contain Duck tailback
Onterrio Smith. Freshman tackle C.J. Niusulu, making his first start,
and end Asi Faoa, making his first start in three years, did not hurt
the Bruins. Smith rushed for 154 yards but did not score. He did most
of his damage in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   2. Quarterback Cory Paus must not aggravate his bruised right
shoulder and must exploit inexperienced Duck cornerbacks by hitting
Craig Bragg and Tab Perry deep. Paus remained healthy and indeed
connected with Bragg and Perry, who combined for 356 yards receiving
and four touchdowns. However, Paus had three passes intercepted in
the first half and never found tight end Mike Seidman.</TE>
<TE>   3. If history holds, the outcome will be determined in the fourth
quarter. The Bruins must make plays down the stretch. UCLA outplayed
Oregon for most of the second half but on its last possession failed
to penetrate deeply enough to give Chris Griffith an easy field-goal
try. Tyler Ebell, who ran well all day, lost two yards in his last
two carries and Paus missed on a pass to Bragg on third down, leaving
Griffith with a 46-yard attempt that he missed.</TE>

<HD>Howry Gets to Have a Little Fun</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Terry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Your senior year in college is supposed to be fun, especially when
you are set to graduate on time.</LD>
<LD>   But until Saturday Oregon wide receiver Keenan Howry hadn't been
having much fun.</LD>
<LD>   In January, Howry had surgery on his left shoulder to repair the
ligament damage he suffered in 2001 and missed all of spring
practice. When the Ducks began fall drills, Howry, from Los Alamitos,
lost more time because of tendinitis in his right knee.</LD>
<TE>   Then two weeks ago, Howry suffered a personal loss when his aunt,
Glendean Ward, died of cancer. She was 57.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very close to her," said Glenda Howry, Keenan's mother and
Glendean's sister.</TE>
<TE>   "She kept him when he was a baby, helped raise him. She was like a
grandmother. We all called her Mama T because that's what he called
her."</TE>
<TE>   Howry visited Ward, who lived in Carson, one last time last month.
After Oregon's game at Arizona last weekend, Howry returned for
Ward's funeral, and stayed three extra days at home to finish sorting
things out.</TE>
<TE>   So if Howry was having a subpar season, it was understandable.
Before Saturday's game against UCLA, he was the Ducks' fourth-leading
receiver with 12 catches for 174 yards and one touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   But against the Bruins, Howry looked like his old self. In the
second quarter he broke loose for a 79-yard punt return, and in the
fourth quarter he hauled in a 74-yard touchdown pass from Jason Fife.
Both plays were vital for the Ducks in a 31-30 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Howry credited his blockers for the punt return, saying the Ducks
now set up their returns in the middle of the field regardless of
where the ball is caught. "I got the ball, made a little move, then
headed to the middle and ran to the open field, where I got a great
block from Jason Willis," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On the touchdown catch, he gave an assist to the Bruins. After
reading remarks from UCLA defenders quoted in newspapers as saying he
didn't look like himself, that he wasn't running hard, Howry was
waiting to make a big play.</TE>
<TE>   "They got me fired up," said Howry, who had three receptions for
87 yards, and 87 yards in punt returns. "This season we've spent the
year establishing the running game, and the passing game hasn't been
needed. I couldn't believe someone would think I'm not playing hard."</TE>
<TE>   Howry said he had to get "about 80 tickets" for Saturday's game.
He would have liked to have needed one more for his favorite fan. But
he believes Glendean is watching him, and watching out for him. "I've
been playing for her ever since the Arizona game last week," Howry
said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Howry wasn't the only Californian to hurt the Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman running back Terrence Whitehead, who starred at Crenshaw
High, ran 37 yards for a touchdown. It was the longest gain from
scrimmage by a Duck runner this season.</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Gipson, a freshman defensive back from Alta Loma, had two of
the three first-half interceptions against UCLA's Cory Paus. Another
freshman, Steven Moore from Dorsey High, had the other.</TE>
<TE>   Junior running back Onterrio Smith of Sacramento rushed for 154
yards in 25 carries. It was his sixth straight 100-yard game,
breaking the Oregon record set by Bobby Moore (now Ahmad Rashad).</TE>
<TE>   Fife, a junior who played at Lake Elsinore Temescal Canyon,
completed 14 of 18 passes for 202 yards with two touchdowns despite
four sacks.</TE>
<TE>   And sophomore Jared Siegel of Sacramento kicked a 59-yard field
goal, setting an Oregon record and tying the Pac-10 record for
conference games set by Stanford's Rod Garcia against USC in 1973.</TE>

<HD>Trojans Hand It to McCullough</HD>
<DH>Tailback benefits from new emphasis on running, carries 39
times for 176 yards in 30-28 victory over Cal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The game plan was simple, if somewhat antiquated for USC.</LD>
<LD>   The Trojans intended to run over, run past and run through
California regardless of circumstance Saturday at the Coliseum.</LD>
<LD>   Sultan McCullough was the primary beneficiary of the pass-happy
Trojans' change in scheme and the senior tailback did not disappoint.</LD>
<TE>   McCullough carried 39 times, the most in his career, and tied a
career-best with 176 yards as the Trojans overcame an 18-point
deficit for a 30-28 Pacific 10 Conference victory before 63,113.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody's got to carry the load and it was me," McCullough said
after the Trojans reached the midpoint of their season by improving
to 4-2 overall and 2-1 in the Pac-10.</TE>
<TE>   McCullough received plenty of help.</TE>
<TE>   The oft-criticized offensive line created space and wore down
Cal's front seven.</TE>
<TE>   "All week during practice, the coaches really emphasized the
running game--I think we got the picture," freshman tackle Winston
Justice said.</TE>
<TE>   USC quarterback Carson Palmer created opportunities, freelanced a
bit and threw more deep and mid-range passes than he had all season.
The defense, playing without injured All-American safety Troy
Polamalu, recovered from a poor start and dominated the second half.
And last--but not least in the minds of the Golden Bears--the Trojans
got a charitable call from the officials on a touchdown pass to
Kareem Kelly.</TE>
<TE>   The victory, the Trojans' first over California at the Coliseum
since 1994, helped ease the pain of last week's 30-27 overtime defeat
at Washington State. USC lost when Ryan Killeen's 52-yard field-goal
attempt went wide right.</TE>
<TE>   After watching his team spot the Golden Bears a 21-3 lead, USC
Coach Pete Carroll bathed in his team's dominating second-half
performance and breaks that went the Trojans' way.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you just have to have a little bit of good fortune,"
Carroll said. "If you saw how much that kick curved last week against
Washington State, you'd understand we're just getting closer to
even."</TE>
<TE>   Cal quarterback Kyle Boller also lent a helping hand.</TE>
<TE>   The senior from Newhall Hart High looked spectacular in the first
20 minutes for a team that began the game having outscored opponents,
142-38, in the first half, and was ranked fourth in the nation in
turnover margin at plus 13.</TE>
<TE>   Boller, however, fumbled without being hit with 9:08 left in the
second quarter and USC linebacker Matt Grootegoed recovered. The
Trojans roared back with touchdowns on their next two possessions to
pull to within 21-17 at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   With his team trailing, 27-21, and in possession of the ball after
McCullough fumbled with 3:23 left in the game, Boller's pass was
intercepted by safety Jason Leach.</TE>
<TE>   "They dominated in the second half," Cal Coach Jeff Tedford said,
whose team fell to 4-3, 1-2 in the Pac-10. "The way we win games is
to get turnovers and capitalize. Today, we gave the ball away twice."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer took full advantage of the opportunities, completing 25 of
39 passes for 289 yards and two touchdowns with two interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer's first scoring pass came after the Trojans drove from
their 34 to the Golden Bear six after Boller's fumble. The senior
scrambled to his right and threw to Kelly diving in the back of the
end zone. One official ruled touchdown but another convened a
conference. As the video board clearly showed the ball hitting the
ground before Kelly gained control, the officials signaled touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "Count it," Kelly said. "They put their hands up."</TE>
<TE>   USC pulled to within 21-17 with 1:06 left in the first half when
freshman wide receiver Mike Williams caught a pass on a slant pattern
and brushed off three defenders on his way to a 21-yard touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "We came in at halftime feeling like we were in control," said
Grootegoed, who made a team-high 11 tackles, including two sacks.
"Coach made a few adjustments and everything changed."</TE>
<TE>   USC took the lead on the opening possession of the second half.
The Trojans drove 68 yards in 12 plays and McCullough capped the
6-minute 22-second drive with a two-yard run that put the Trojans
ahead, 24-21.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans increased the lead to 27-21 with 9:59 left in the game
on a 32-yard field goal by Killeen that concluded a 52-yard, 12-play
drive that consumed 5:31.</TE>
<TE>   USC went ahead, 30-21, on Killeen's 18-yard field goal with 1:41
left before Cal waged a final threat.</TE>
<TE>   Boller drove the Golden Bears 65 yards and brought them to within
30-28 on a five-yard touchdown pass to tight end Tom Swoboda with 35
seconds to go.</TE>
<TE>   But Grootegoed, who suffered a season-ending broken leg against
the Golden Bears last year, recovered an on-side kick to secure the
victory.</TE>
<TE>   USC finished with 464 yards and dominated possession, controlling
the ball for 38 minutes 32 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "They were eating up so much time on the clock, we were getting
cold on the sideline just standing around," USC middle linebacker
Mike Pollard said.</TE>
<TE>   McCullough, who was stuck in a tailback rotation with Justin
Fargas and Malaefou MacKenzie through the first five games of the
season, gained 120 yards in the second half to record the 11th
100-yard game of his career.</TE>
<TE>   McCullough's performance opened things up for Palmer, who
completed six passes to Williams for 103 yards, six passes to flanker
Keary Colbert for 75 yards and five to tight end Alex Holmes for 65.</TE>
<TE>   "The offensive line was just moving people around, and half the
time they knew we were going to run the ball," Palmer said. "I'm
audiblizing and the whole defense knows he's running their way and we
still would get six yards."</TE>
<TE>   The victory kept USC in the Pac-10 race as they prepare for their
next game against Washington. The Trojans intend to keep their
momentum and make a run for their first Rose Bowl appearance since
the 1995 season.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing about this team, we don't give up," defensive end Omar
Nazel said. "We showed tonight we can finish."</TE>

<TE>   Return of a Trojan Tradition</TE>
<TE>   A trademark of USC football from the mid-1960s through the
mid-1980s was workhorse tailbacks. However, the 39 carries by Sultan
McCullough on Saturday were the most for the Trojans in 15 years. A
look at USC running backs with 39 or more carries:</TE>
<TE>   (text of infobox not included)</TE>
<TE>   -- NOTABLE --</TE>
<TE>   * Bell set USC records for carries (51), rushing yards (347)
against Washington State Oct. 9, 1976</TE>
<TE>   * McCullough's 39 carries were most for USC since Webster (40)
against Washington Oct. 18, 1987</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO THE GAME</TE>
<TE>   Gary Klein's keys to the game and how the Trojans measured up:</TE>
<TE>   1. Control Kyle Boller. Cal's quarterback started fast, completing
11 of 14 passes in the first half for 124 yards and a touchdown. But
he fumbled in the second quarter, opening the door for USC to come
back, and had a pass intercepted in the fourth quarter that killed a
potential rally. Boller finished 20 of 30 for 221 yards.</TE>
<TE>   2. Establish a running game. The Trojans abandoned their tailback
rotation and handed the ball to senior Sultan McCullough 39 times. He
responded with 176 yards, a touchdown and averaged 4.5 yards per
carry behind an offensive line that carried the day.</TE>
<TE>   3. Convert extra-point and field-goal attempts. Ryan Killeen
kicked field goals of 34, 32 and 18 yards and made all three
extra-point attempts. He missed a 38-yard field-goal attempt in the
third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   4. Avoid penalties. After being penalized 10 times for a
season-high 103 yards against Washington State last week, the Trojans
eliminated mistakes and were flagged only four times for 30 yards.</TE>

<HD>Kelly's Score Disputed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rob Fernas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC's first touchdown Saturday was open to debate.</LD>
<LD>   Officials ruled that Kareem Kelly caught a six-yard scoring pass
from Carson Palmer in the second quarter. Kelly steadfastly agreed.</LD>
<LD>   But replays showed otherwise, and California Coach Jeff Tedford
and his players voiced their displeasure with the call after Kelly's
touchdown proved pivotal in USC's 30-28 come-from-behind victory.</LD>
<TE>   "It was obvious he didn't catch it," said Cal defensive back
Nnamdi Asomugha, who was covering Kelly.</TE>
<TE>   "I caught it," Kelly said.</TE>
<TE>   Whoever you wish to believe, there was little doubt about the
impact of the touchdown. It got the Trojans off the ropes after they
had fallen behind, 21-3.</TE>
<TE>   On third and goal at the Cal six, Kelly appeared to make a diving
catch just inside the back line of the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   Back judge Jim Northcott, who was closely trailing the play,
immediately signaled touchdown. But field judge Michael Mothershed,
who was farther away but facing the play, rushed up to talk with
Northcott. The officials stepped back to confer while the players
waited to see if it would be ruled a touchdown or an incomplete pass.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, several replays on the giant video screen at the
Coliseum showed that Kelly trapped the ball against the ground.
Moments later, officials signaled touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Replays cannot be used to review plays in college football, so the
call wasn't surprising.</TE>
<TE>   At least not to Kelly, who said it was a catch all the way.</TE>
<TE>   "The replay might have shown the ball come out, but I had it," he
said. "The ground helped me secure it. The ground doesn't cause
fumbles in college, so it was a touchdown."</TE>
<TE>   Asomugha, a sophomore from Harbor City Narbonne High, saw it
differently.</TE>
<TE>   "When we looked on the replay, it showed that he dropped the
ball," Asomugha said. "And then they signaled touchdown. It looked
like they were going to overturn it, but I guess ..."</TE>
<TE>   Referee David Cutaia said the touchdown was not overturned because
none of the officials saw the ball hit the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "The touchdown was signaled by the back judge, who saw the ball
caught and [Kelly] roll over with the ball," Cutaia said. "He did not
see the ball on the ground at all. The other official went over and
they talked. Neither official said he saw the ball on the ground,
therefore it's a touchdown."</TE>
<TE>   The explanation was little consolation for Tedford, who said he
argued with Cutaia after the play.</TE>
<TE>   "I called [Cutaia] over and said, 'Why are you debating that if
there wasn't a problem? And I'm telling you there was a problem
because [Kelly] did not catch that ball,' " Tedford said. "And he
said that most of them thought he did [catch it].</TE>
<TE>   "The call was wrong ... but once a decision is made, there's
nothing I can do about it."</TE>
<TE>   Cal cornerback James Bethea said Palmer, who allowed Kelly to
elude Asomugha by scrambling on the play, should never have gotten
the pass off in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   "We should have had him sacked on that play," Bethea said. "We
didn't and you see what happened, they scored."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Palmer passed for 289 yards and moved into third place on the
Pac-10 all-time passing list with 9,509 yards. The fifth-year senior
trails only Cade McNown of UCLA (10,368 yards in 1995-98) and Steve
Stenstrom of Stanford (10,911 in 1991-94).</TE>

<LD>Hard to believe, but the season keeps getting worse for college
kickers.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA's Chris Griffith had an extra-point attempt blocked in the
third quarter and was wide left on a 46-yard field-goal attempt with
1:54 left in the Bruins' 31-30 loss Saturday against Oregon.</LD>
<LD>   Syracuse Coach Paul Pasqualoni's job security took another hit
when Collin Barber's extra-point attempt bounced off the left upright
with 30 seconds left, giving Temple a 17-16 victory.</LD>
<TE>   Kansas State easily defeated Oklahoma State, 44-9, but had three
point-after attempts blocked.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan kickers Philip Brabbs and Troy Nienberg have made four of
12 field goals this season.</TE>
<TE>   Last Saturday, USC's Ryan Killeen missed a conversion attempt with
4:10 left that could have put the Trojans up by four at Washington
State. Instead, the Cougars tied the game with a field goal and won
in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   The worst case of kick-itis, however, took place Saturday in
Miami, where Xavier Beitia's shank to the left made him the fourth
Florida State kicker since 1991 to miss a last-second field-goal try
against the Hurricanes that could have tied or won the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't seen a player take anything worse than him," said team
chaplain Clint Purvis, who whisked the sobbing sophomore into the
trainer's room as reporters entered the Seminole locker room.</TE>
<TE>   Beitia was still bawling when his mother, father and several
police officers escorted him to the team bus.</TE>
<TE>   Hey, it could have been worse. The other three Seminole kickers
who blew it against Miami were wide right.</TE>

<DL>DAVEYTON South Africa</DL>
<LD>The smooth sounds of saxophone, drum, piano and guitar spill from the
open windows of the old municipal building, mixing incongruously with
the American hip-hop blaring from taxicabs zooming by.</LD>
<LD>   But the young men and women learning to play and write jazz at the
PMV Music Academy in this poor township take pride in making music
that their peers dismiss as a relic of an older generation.</LD>
<LD>   Nthabiseng Mokoena, 23, an alto saxophonist who was orphaned as a
child, says she joined the school five years after seeing its band
play at an orphanage party.</LD>
<TE>   "What they played, it meant something," said the soft-spoken
Mokoena, her hair in short dreadlocks. She dreams of recording her
own solo album, but for now says she still has a lot to learn.</TE>
<TE>   Johnny Mekoa, a well-known jazz trumpeter, founded the academy
with help from civic groups and businesses in hopes that the
discipline of music would help keep young people from poor families
away from drugs and crime.</TE>
<TE>   "Here these kids learn the truth: that they must learn to play
music the proper way," said Mekoa, a heavyset man with gray hair.</TE>
<TE>   Daveyton, 10 miles east of Johannesburg, boasts more solidly built
homes and smooth tarred roads than other townships. But its young
people remain economically and academically handicapped by the legacy
of apartheid, which ended in 1994 with the country's first all-race
elections.</TE>
<TE>   Jazz was part of a body of protest music -- along with strictly
African forms -- through which black South Africans channeled their
hopes and frustrations during the struggle against apartheid.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a democratic form of music, played all over the
townships," Mekoa said. "It used to keep alive the voices of the
masses."</TE>
<TE>   Nowadays, though, South African music is typically a mix of
American hip-hop and the local Kwaito, which merges rap and African
rhythms</TE>
<TE>   Mthunzi Mvubu, at 15 already the lead saxophone in the jazz
school's band, says he immerses himself in his own music while his
peers dance to the latest tunes or are out on the street playing
soccer.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm motivated by the love of it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Trumpeter Tumelo Sikosana, 18, says he ignores the gibes of his
friends who consider his music old-fashioned.</TE>
<TE>   "Jazz music lasts longer. I'm still listening to music my father
bought while he was still young," said Sikosana, a slight young man
with glasses and worn sneakers. "Some of them [my friends] couldn't
imagine me in a tuxedo and licking my lips getting ready to blow the
trumpet," he said with a radiant smile.</TE>
<TE>   Sikosana, a first-year university student, joined the music school
more than a year ago. He schedules his college classes between his
studies at the music school -- musical theory in the morning and
rehearsals in late afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, Mekoa played with the Jazz Ministers, one of the
first South African jazz bands to become known internationally. Now
his students are sharing his experience -- the school's band recently
traveled to a jazz festival in England.</TE>
<TE>   Mekoa is a one-man band -- administrator, fund-raiser, teacher and
conductor. Sitting in front of a green chalkboard covered with
scribbled musical notes, he taps his feet to the band's beat and
calls out to a student bass guitarist instructions on which notes to
play.</TE>
<TE>   "The next one is a G7-Flat 9, and go to C7 and go to B-Flat and go
to E7," Mekoa says, and the sound begins to flow.</TE>
<TE>   The school's most popular instrument is the saxophone -- it has
nine sax players. Other students include a bass guitarist,
percussionist, pianist and bongo drum player. The group squeezes into
a room small in size but large in dedication.</TE>
<TE>   Most had no access to music education before.</TE>
<TE>   "I throw these kids at the deep end, and they must learn to swim,"
Mekoa said.</TE>

<HD>Russia Battles Hazings, Desertions in Military</HD>
<DH>President Putin is pushing to do away with the draft and
create a professional army.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vladimir Isachenkov</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>The Russian soldiers were napping when a burst of automatic gunfire
shot up their dugout in the Caucasus Mountains. Two shadows slipped
into the valley below, leaving eight corpses behind.</LD>
<LD>   Officials at first blamed the usual suspects, rebels from nearby
Chechnya, but then the investigation took a different tack. After a
four-day hunt involving thousands of police, Pvts. Oleg Khismatulin
and Nikolai Bozhkov were caught and confessed to killing their
comrades, saying it was vengeance for having been hazed.</LD>
<LD>   The killings in late August topped national television headlines
as the bloodiest military shootout since February, when two Russian
paratroopers fled their unit and killed 10 police officers and
civilians.</LD>
<TE>   It has highlighted anew the military's worsening problem of hazing
and desertions, and seems to lend urgency to President Vladimir V.
Putin's push to replace conscription with a mostly professional army
by 2010.</TE>
<TE>   One desertion got into the news in early September because of its
scandalous scale: 54 soldiers left their unit in southern Russia and
marched some 35 miles to Volgograd to protest beatings by their
officers.</TE>
<TE>   But most desertions, a daily occurrence throughout the armed
forces, go unreported unless they turn violent.</TE>
<TE>   According to the deputy chief of the Russian General Staff, Lt.
Gen. Vasily Smirnov, 2,270 servicemen fled their units during the
first six months of the year and 860 remained missing. Smirnov said
2,265 deserters were at large, some for as long as 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's anti-draft activists give a much higher figure -- about
40,000 -- and say only radical reform can improve things.</TE>
<TE>   "The military degradation has gone too far to deal with through
evolutionary steps," said Ida Kuklina, an activist with Soldiers'
Mothers, Russia's leading anti-draft group. "The army is the only
part of Russian society that has remained virtually unreformed since
Soviet times, except for shrinking in size."</TE>
<TE>   She said her group believes that about 3,000 servicemen die every
year in shootouts, suicides and accidents -- not counting daily
casualties in the war with separatists in Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   Smirnov said that excluding deaths in battle, 483 servicemen died
on and off duty in the first half of the year, about one-third by
suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Hazing starts with routine demands for young conscripts to clean
toilets, wash older soldiers' socks or beg on the streets for
cigarette money. The defiant or weak-willed are beaten and, in some
cases, tortured, raped and killed. In one glaring example, Russian
media recently reported a military prostitution ring in Moscow in
which sergeants offered their men as prostitutes.</TE>
<TE>   Captured deserters usually face a military tribunal and are sent
to punishment units. Sometimes, authorities simply return deserters
to their units, as apparently happened to the 54 soldiers who marched
to Volgograd.</TE>
<TE>   Desertions aren't unique to Russia.</TE>
<TE>   During the Vietnam War, according to figures cited by Col. Robert
D. Heinl Jr. in the Armed Forces Journal, the U.S. military in 1970
had 209 "fraggings" -- soldiers' slang for murder or attempted murder
of an unpopular officer -- and 65,643 desertions, the rough
equivalent of four infantry divisions.</TE>
<TE>   But hazing in Russia's military is so widespread and brutal that
it has no parallel abroad, Russian anti-draft campaigners say.</TE>
<TE>   The Defense Ministry has started posting morale officers to units.
But at a battalion stationed near the Caucasus Mountains' city of
Vladikavkaz, no change was evident. A morale officer said neither he
nor other officers were making any efforts to prevent hazing.</TE>
<TE>   "The older soldiers educate young troops. This is the way the army
is built," said the young lieutenant, who identified himself only by
his first name, Dmitry. "We mustn't break the established rules."</TE>
<TE>   Every Russian male aged 18-27 is supposed to serve two years in
the military, but college deferments, health exemptions and bribes
mean that only about 12% of potential conscripts were actually called
up this spring, compared with about 17% three years ago, according to
military officials.</TE>
<TE>   Struggling to fill the ranks, the military routinely drafts men
with mental illnesses and criminal records.</TE>
<TE>   "The current law doesn't forbid calling up convicts with suspended
sentences, some of whom have strong criminal habits," said Mikhail
Yanenko, a spokesman for the Chief Military Prosecutor's office.</TE>
<TE>   Yanenko also said many military crimes occur because poorly paid
officers are negligent.</TE>
<TE>   Dmitry, the lieutenant, said he is satisfied with older soldiers
looking after young conscripts at his unit and intervenes only if a
soldier behaves defiantly.</TE>
<TE>   After a new conscript recently threatened to flee, "we locked him
up with his hands and feet tied for a week, and all his impertinence
was gone," Dmitry said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that he also uses a 28-inch, hard-rubber baton he calls
an "educator" to punish unruly soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-draft activists say officers make little effort to prevent
suicides and killings in the military because they carry virtually no
responsibility for soldiers' deaths.</TE>
<TE>   "Violence is an inherent part of the existing system," said
Kuklina of the Soldiers' Mothers group. "This problem will never be
solved until the draft is abolished."</TE>
<TE>   Under pressure from the Kremlin, the military launched a two-year
pilot project in September to switch one airborne division entirely
from conscripts to professionals, and build housing and other
infrastructure. The military views it as a test of how quickly Russia
can afford a fully professional military.</TE>
<TE>   But Putin's order to phase out conscription has met stubborn
resistance from the top brass, who say the military lacks the funds
to pay for a professional military. In fact, the number of
professionals is falling.</TE>
<TE>   In April, 132,000 of Russia's 1.3 million servicemen were contract
soldiers, down from 260,000 a few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The military blames low pay of around $100 a month, about the same
as the nation's average wage.</TE>
<TE>   A declining birth rate threatens to further diminish the military,
with anti-draft campaigners predicting the number of conscripts will
drop by half after 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Liberal lawmaker Boris Nemtsov, who advocates a contract army,
warns: "Russia may physically lose its army in 2005-2006."</TE>
