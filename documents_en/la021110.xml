<HD>Building a War: As Some Argue, Supply Lines Fill Up</HD>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In all the to-and-fro of debate over whether the United States should
or will wage war against Iraq, almost no one was paying attention to
Maj. Gen. Kenneth Privratsky. Outside the tight little world of the
Military Traffic Management Command, almost no one had even heard of
him. Yet Privratsky's former assignment may tell us more about the
true intent and direction of the Bush administration than all the
diplomatic pronouncements, political maneuvers and United Nations
debates put together.</LD>
<LD>   Privratsky was busy shipping thousands of tons of military
equipment and supplies to the network of new U.S. bases that have
sprung up like dragon's teeth across Central Asia and the Middle
East. Among the resources he was using was the Russian railway
system.</LD>
<LD>   "I never imagined that I would be involved in shipping cargo
through Russia," the former Traffic Command chief says, seeming a
little awed to have found himself running Army supply trains through
the heartland of his former Cold War enemy.</LD>
<TE>   An army marches on its stomach, Napoleon famously observed. There
is no more voracious military stomach than the U.S. armed forces. And
since the war on terrorism began with Americans fighting in
Afghanistan, the Defense Department has moved with notable agility to
extend its globe-girdling capacity to march. It is this massive
buildup of military capabilities -- and the way it ropes in reluctant
partners, sometimes publicly and sometimes privately -- that shows
where senior officials in the Bush administration are headed.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts have suggested that U.N. weapons inspections may
reduce the likelihood of war. That is not how senior White House and
Pentagon officials see it. None believes Saddam Hussein will permit
effective inspections, but they see the U.N. effort as a win-win
situation: The inspections process will improve the political climate
for eventual action and buy time for the Pentagon to get ready. The
war that Bush and his team think is necessary and inevitable will
thus come with the approval of both Congress and the U.N. Meanwhile,
one of the main practical obstacles to war with Iraq will have been
dealt with: The enormous infrastructure needed to supply and sustain
today's armed forces against Iraq is being constructed on the
foundations of the system created for the war in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghanistan war, initiated just 26 days after the attacks of
Sept. 11, set in motion the third-biggest airlift effort in history,
after the Berlin airlift of 1948-49 and the allied buildup following
the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. But it was not enough. Sea-lift
and surface shipments were needed too. Ships carried ammunition,
military supplies and humanitarian aid to Persian Gulf and Pakistani
ports for American and coalition forces to the south and west. In the
north, containers were unloaded at ports in the Netherlands and
Germany, in the Russian Arctic, on the Black Sea, and in Vladivostok
in the Russian far east.</TE>
<TE>   These shipments made their way to U.S. forces operating for the
first time in Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and the jumble of other 'stans,
using a complex system of rail lines that included those of the
former Soviet Union and its old satellites. The Russian system was
especially fragile, ground down by decades of communist mismanagement
and neglect. But U.S. logistics specialists and U.S. materiel made it
work. The new system could not only handle vastly larger quantities
of material but do so at substantially lower cost. For example,
flying the first 1.4 million humanitarian rations into Afghanistan
cost more than $7 per meal; sending the next million rations via
surface transportation cost just 15 cents per meal.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Privratsky and his colleagues had the surface routes
fully operational, they were handling 92% of all military cargo used
in Afghanistan. Today, that system is being retooled for Iraq. Many
bases in the Persian Gulf region can serve as well for war in Iraq as
they have for Afghanistan. And the reduced scale of military
operations in Afghanistan -- along with greater allied military
involvement there -- is freeing up resources for the next conflict.</TE>
<TE>   To understand the scale of the effort underway, one must look at
the Pentagon's evolving war plans. Prior to Sept. 11, Central
Command's blueprint for war with Iraq, OPLAN 1003-98, calculated that
10 airfields and six seaports would be needed to sustain air, ground
and naval forces. As the plan has evolved, force levels have grown
and the requirement for airfields and seaports has risen to 18 and 13
respectively. OPLAN 1003-98 calls for more than 60,000 short tons in
supplies a day, the equivalent of some 3,500 tractor-trailers driving
the distance from Tampa, Fla., to Savannah, Ga., every day -- or
5,000 flights by C-130 Hercules cargo planes.</TE>
<TE>   It is the logistical equivalent of loading up, moving and
unloading everyone and everything in the city of Norfolk, Va. --
population 230,000 -- including all the automobiles, to the Middle
East. Fortunately for the Pentagon, Kuwait has given carte blanche
for the use of its airfields, ports and warehouses in any upcoming
war. Thanks to operations Southern and Northern Watch, which have
patrolled the "no-fly" zones in Iraq for the last 12 years, the
United States also has well-tended and continually expanded bases in
Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Oman.</TE>
<TE>   Qatar formally entered the mix when Operation Enduring Freedom
began last year. The base at the British-controlled island of Diego
Garcia in the Indian Ocean also stands ready to host heavy B-2 and
B-52 bombers.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is on board. Jordan has made it clear to Washington
that it cannot overtly host American forces on its soil. Also, Saudi
Arabia is uncomfortable with the direction of U.S. policy. Pentagon
leaders, however, remain confident the Saudis will ultimately allow
everything except the launching of offensive strikes from their soil.
But even if the United States were to lose its modern command center
and air base at Prince Sultan, the lineup of alternatives is
impressive.</TE>
<TE>   Though media attention has focused on the new U.S. base at Al
Udeid in Qatar, the buildup in Oman looms largest in Pentagon
calculations. Oman was not much used in Desert Storm, but it now has
three major bases that could serve as alternatives to other bases in
the Arab world. For years, the Pentagon has been stockpiling
munitions in Oman. In December, B-1 bombers operating from Diego
Garcia moved to Thumrait, Oman. That reduced the need for shipping
munitions to the more distant British base, and it brought the planes
closer to Iraq. Moreover, munitions have been moved to Oman from
Azraq in Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the Middle East, U.S. bases in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan,
Uzbekistan and other parts of Central Asia add to the capabilities
against Iraq. Many of these bases had just become fully operational
as the fighting in Afghanistan ended. Moreover, U.S. units stationed
there are being augmented, and in some cases replaced, by French
Mirages. F-16s are also expected from Norway, Denmark and the
Netherlands. More allied aircraft in Afghanistan means more U.S.
planes free for duty elsewhere. If necessary, these planes and some
of the new bases, with their established ship and rail supply lines
through Russia, could even play a direct role against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Remember, F-15E Strike Eagles flew combat missions from Kuwait
around Iran into Afghanistan. There is no reason why similar missions
could not be flown from Central Asia to Iraq. Aerial tankers stand
ready at 17 locations, including places like Bulgaria. Next month,
the U.S. Central Command will send a mobile command post and a staff
of 600 to Qatar for "Exercise Internal Look." Their mission: to test
the networks of communications and computers needed to link together
air, naval, ground, special operations, intelligence and coalition
partners' assets during an Iraq war.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon, said CENTCOM commander Tommy Franks, wants "to be
sure that we have the right bandwidth lined up, to be sure that we
can talk to our components." Even the laborious task of bringing in
the heavy weapons and large formations of Army and Marine Corps
troops is well advanced. Much of the heavy gear is already positioned
in the region. Ships are bringing in more. The Dahl, for instance,
left Charleston, S.C., on April 14 bound for the Persian Gulf with
the largest shipment ever loaded on a Navy roll-on, roll-off
transport.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, as the United Nations Security Council debated and
approved a resolution on Iraq, it is worth remembering that the best
guide to White House intentions may be deeds, not words. By all
signs, the necessary pieces of the great logistical puzzle are
settling into place for war in early winter.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqis may chatter about whether the U.S. armed forces have
what it takes for another war. The answer is just over the horizon,
in all directions. And for those who worry about unilateralism, the
Bush war machine seems to enjoy a surprising number of compliant, if
not vocal, partners. Just look at Brig. Gen. Ann E. Dunwoody,
Privratsky's replacement, and her Russian railroad.</TE>

<HD>In Hannibal Country</HD>
<DH>Snipers, anthrax, child snatchings. They reinforce the
post-9/11 sense that we now live in a world of random evil.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Neal Gabler</AU>
<BD>Neal Gabler, a senior fellow at the Norman Lear Center
at USC Annenberg, is the author of "Life the Movie: How Entertainment
Conquered Reality."</BD>
<DL>AMAGANSETT, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Shortly after 9/11, cultural analysts asserted that the terrorist
attacks had created a new paradigm, a whole new prism through which
we view our experience and imagine our future. By definition,
paradigms, like Copernicus' revision of the universe or Einstein's
theory of relativity, constitute a dramatic break from the way we
think and live. By that standard, 9/11 seemed to qualify, though in
only the narrowest sense. America was waging a new kind of war, it
was forming unexpected friendships, and flying would never be the
same again. Otherwise, American daily life seemed hardly affected by
9/11.</LD>
<LD>   But the recent sniper attacks in Maryland, Washington, D.C., and
Virginia, as well as a series of other seemingly unrelated incidents,
suggest that 9/11 has, over the last year, emerged as a paradigm
after all.</LD>
<TE>   In ways both subtle and profound, and without most of us really
being fully aware of it, 9/11 seems to have invaded our
consciousness, caused us to emphasize and then reinterpret certain
events, altered our perspectives, heightened our anxieties and shaken
our faith. It has fundamentally changed the way we view the world, so
that episodes like the sniper killings seem less aberrations in a
benign universe than the cold reality of a malign one. It has
encouraged us, moreover, to look for those things that underscore our
vulnerability, essentially recreating the world in the image of 9/11.
In a way, 9/11 has turned America into Hannibal Country -- a nation
fraught with a sense of evil, danger and death.</TE>
<TE>   This is not to say that what 9/11 has wrought is novel. History
often flings out paradigms that first signify and then shape the
national consciousness. The Great Depression created a sense of
anxiety and guilt that ran through the culture. The bombing of
Hiroshima introduced a nuclear age that infused the nation with fear
of a holocaust. The assassination of President Kennedy convinced
America that it had lost its innocence, and the war in Vietnam seemed
to demonstrate that the country had lost its moral compass and thus
its moral authority.</TE>
<TE>   Each of these historical events did more than trigger a national
mood. They rapidly assumed symbolic status that helped redefine the
country. They became metaphors -- the Depression for the punishment
that America had to visit upon itself for the excesses of the 1920s;
the bomb for the hubris of man playing God; the Kennedy assassination
for the violence that lurked within the country and betrayed its
happy, placid exterior; Vietnam for the arrogance of American power.</TE>
<TE>   In turn, each metaphor was subsumed psychologically and
culturally, thrumming as the text or subtext in American movies,
songs, novels and poems. (Just think of how Vietnam, for example,
surfaced in movies as dissimilar as "Chinatown" and "McCabe and Mrs.
Miller.") America became successively the Depression Nation, the
Nuclear Nation, the Nation of Lost Dreams and the Nation of Misguided
Ambitions. But these were not only themes that arose from the events
themselves; they became frames into which much of American life was
fitted. As a result of imposing the metaphor on the society, these
visions of the country became self-fulfilling prophecies.</TE>
<TE>   In much the same way, 9/11 appears to be an event that has become
a metaphor, though it has done so much more stealthily. 9/11
incorporated several basic themes. The essential element of the
attacks that day was surprise. You could be sitting at your desk one
second and be immolated the next. Nothing in our experience, not even
Pearl Harbor, had prepared us for this. The second element was the
capriciousness of fate that the attacks illustrated. There was no
explanation for why some survived and others didn't, much less an
explanation of why anyone at all had to die that day. And the third
element was the inexplicability of the evil that caused it. The
victims were not soldiers at war; they were ordinary citizens doing
their daily business. None of them had done anything to deserve their
deaths. The deed could only be attributed to a force so heinous that
it was beyond our comprehension.</TE>
<TE>   But 9/11 didn't create fear or anxiety out of whole cloth. As
Barry Glassner has analyzed it in his book "The Culture of Fear,"
Americans have long been subjected to fear-mongering both by the
media and by various corporations, because fear can sell products.
And Americans certainly had experienced the whims of fate in the
reports of every airplane crash or killer hurricane or outbreak of
deadly disease. We were also aware of the continuing possibility of
evil long before 9/11, because we had witnessed it in a line of
psychopaths from Adolf Hitler to Jeffrey Dahmer. In fact, suspicion
and doubt had become embedded in the American mind.</TE>
<TE>   Until 9/11, however, these feelings had not displaced America's
basic optimism. It took 9/11 to reify the inchoate fears and slowly
force us to perceive the world as a different place. Since 9/11 there
is a new sense of vulnerability, a feeling of senselessness, a
recognition of the palpability and ubiquity of evil.</TE>
<TE>   One of the reasons this wasn't readily apparent immediately after
9/11 is that it has manifested itself less in large effusions than in
small signs. Take the news. Before 9/11, the big news story was Rep.
Gary A. Condit's possible involvement in the death of a young former
intern. Some observers quickly predicted that the Condit saga
wouldn't last in the face of a new post-9/11 sobriety. It didn't
last, but that may have had less to do with sobriety than with the
fact that it didn't fit the new paradigm of 9/11. Stories like the
anthrax scare or the apprehension of alleged terrorists in Buffalo,
N.Y., and Portland, Ore. -- which buttressed the psychological triad
of vulnerability, arbitrariness and evil -- were now favored over
stories of personal and political scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, earlier this year there was a spate of stories about
young children, usually girls, being kidnapped and killed. Though law
enforcement officials later said that the number of kidnappings
hadn't really increased, the media seized on these incidents as if
kidnapping and murder were epidemic. They did so because the public
was fascinated by these reports, but one can argue that the public
was fascinated not because it had some morbid curiosity but because
nothing seemed to reinforce vulnerability, senselessness and evil as
did the murders of innocent children. These horrifying stories played
out the 9/11 paradigm. Nor may it be a coincidence that two recent
popular novels, Donna Tartt's long-awaited "The Little Friend" and
Alice Sebold's "The Lovely Bones," both concern murdered children. It
is an idea that clearly taps into the national fragility.</TE>
<TE>   This may have been even truer of the snipers. During the siege,
profilers remarked how these killers were different from previous
ones. They struck randomly. They struck at street corners, gas
stations, schoolyards and parking lots -- places where one was
presumed safe. They struck impersonally and at a distance. They
disrupted the ordinariness of life so that people were terrified of
leaving their homes, and though the feeling was totally irrational,
polls indicated that the dread wasn't limited to the Washington area.
The terror was national. By one account, some 82% of Americans felt
unsafe.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, any terror rampage of this sort would have attracted
national attention, especially now that the cable news networks are
there to fan stories all day and all night long. But the intensity of
the spotlight on the snipers, and the fear they engendered, may have
also been a function of just how well they fit the 9/11 paradigm. It
was almost as if they were consciously acting out of a knowledge of
how 9/11 had affected us -- of how it had given us all a case of the
jitters. These were the rare serial killers who actively reinforced
our vulnerability, the arbitrariness of death and the immanence of
evil that had entered the American mind. The snipers were expressions
of 9/11.</TE>
<TE>   For that is the world in which we now find ourselves. It is a
place where men plow planes into skyscrapers, where lunatics send
anthrax spores through the mail, where maniacs snatch little girls
off sidewalks or from their bedrooms, where snipers casually shoot
people pumping gas or loading packages into their cars. It is, alas,
a real world, though perhaps one that is not all that different from
the world before 9/11, where atrocities also occurred. What makes it
seem so different is that everything is of a piece now that we have
reconceptualized the world to demonstrate the terror we have seen and
felt. It is a world made in the image of our new paradigm, and it is
frightening.</TE>

<HD>Are We the Wave of the Future or Have We Just Gone Surfin'?</HD>
<DH>California seems to have lost its direction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I say, fine. The point of being in California has never been to run
with the pack. Many of us like it that way. But I wonder. These fresh
headlines that remind us about life being a few degrees different on
the western side of the Sierra Nevada: Are they describing a
California that's still leading toward the future or one that is now
falling behind into the past?</LD>
<LD>   For more than a generation now, we haven't had to consider the
question. The idea of California-as-Tomorrowland was so deeply
ingrained in our self-image, and the nation's image of us, that the
only inquiry necessary was: Well, what next?</LD>
<LD>   All those jokes and cliches about California? They were
compliments to the powerful force field that made us the most
populous, original, unfettered and, of course, most important of
states.</LD>
<TE>   A quarter of a century ago, no one laughed harder than we did when
Jimmy Carter remarked, "Whatever starts in California unfortunately
has an inclination to spread." We were heard to wonder, so why is it
taking them so long?</TE>
<TE>   In good times and bad, by choice and by accident, events, trends,
ideas and personalities emerged from California to reinforce the
conceit that the very best vantage on destiny could be had by
standing right here where the continent slipped into the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   Remember, Ronald Reagan made conservatism workable again from his
base in nutty California. Jerry Brown launched the state far ahead of
itself, not to mention everyone else, in rocket flights of
imagination. Think of the forward-leaning words associated with
modern California: the free-speech movement, Silicon Valley,
immigration, Proposition 13 and the tax revolt, the Pacific Rim,
multiculturalism.</TE>
<TE>   Communities where you needed just a sweater on the coldest of days
became defined by the hot tub. What other government besides our own
would boast on the official state Web site that the No. 1 product
sold in this No. 1 consumer state was bottled water? What other state
would kill off the last of its grizzly bears with a rifle shot in
1922 and celebrate it as the official state animal?</TE>
<TE>   But  now? We can wonder. Yes, there's plenty of momentum. Only a
fool would discount California's energy or that fine uplifting breeze
of freedom that blows here to nourish opportunity and innovation. No
one dares overlook our sheer numbers.</TE>
<TE>   For now, though, something of a ground fog has swept over U.S.
Highway 101.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that California voted differently than the nation. So
what? It's that California isn't striking sparks on election day
anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Republican victories in other states here and there, some of them
razor-thin, gave the GOP control of Congress. Two airplane crashes in
two years killed two Democratic U.S. senators -- seats that went
Republican on Tuesday and constitute the extent of this new majority.
With it, however, the geography of the future appears to have shifted
too.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard  to tell who is trembling more over George Bush's new
mandate: those who fear for tomorrow or those who are cheering it on.
One thing for sure, people everywhere feel the political motion and
know where it's headed.</TE>
<TE>   I can see the bumper stickers coming: Don't blame me; I'm from
California.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Democrats easily and overwhelmingly triumphed here,
falling short only in the meaningless game of expectations. But I
think it's safe to say that nobody -- least of all victorious Gov.
Gray Davis -- has much idea where the state is headed or even should
be headed, except toward a grinding bloodletting over a
fast-shrinking budget and another round of Me-First-at-the-Trough
ballot initiatives. Apart from immediate family and paid political
lackeys, those who find meaning in the moment are keeping the fact to
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Even those things that continue to set the state apart -- its lead
on vehicle pollution, on family leaves, on labor arbitration for farm
workers -- arise, unfortunately, not from the well of dreams so much
as from the tactical politics of appeasing interest groups. In
reaching for the center, Davis always seems to miss the heart.</TE>
<TE>   It's not so satisfying to look around at ourselves just now. We're
still different. But we can't be sure it's in the way that counts
anymore.</TE>

<LD>Voting for the City Council seat representing Los Angeles' Eastside
is still four months away, but I already know who the favored
candidate should be: former boxer Paul Gonzales. The campaign in the
14th District is shaping up as a real brawl, and nobody in the field
has won as many fights as Gonzales.</LD>
<LD>   Granted, there are candidates in the 14th District -- which
sprawls from Boyle Heights to Eagle Rock -- who are better known in
political circles than Gonzales, whose Olympic gold medal was one of
the great stories of the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Games.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, one of the city's political heavyweights, former
Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, announced that he wants to
represent the district where he grew up. He enters the ring with the
formidable aura of a candidate who, in 2001, was nearly elected the
city's first Latino mayor in a century. His mayoral campaign earned
him broad citywide support. But, much as it may surprise the many
Angelenos who know Villaraigosa but don't know the Eastside, his
campaign will be no coronation.</LD>
<TE>   Another serious contender is Alvin Parra, a well-regarded aide to
L.A. County Supervisor Gloria Molina who has run for the council
before. Molina lives in the 14th District and could wield a lot of
clout on Parra's behalf if she decides to get involved.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the small matter of incumbent Councilman Nick
Pacheco, who has represented the district for four years. Pacheco has
suffered by comparison to his predecessor, Richard Alatorre, who
remained popular on his home turf even when he was embroiled in
citywide scandals that eventually forced him into early retirement.
But Pacheco still has the advantages of incumbency. He has also shown
a willingness to use rough campaign tactics in the past -- one reason
political analysts expect the campaign to get nasty.</TE>
<TE>   There has never been any love lost between Villaraigosa and
Pacheco, who was one of the few Latino officials to back James K.
Hahn against Villaraigosa.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, one of the sleazier incidents of the mayoral campaign
involved a nonprofit group controlled by Pacheco. That agency used
its telephone banks to place automated calls to voters in which a
woman impersonating Molina attacked Villaraigosa for purportedly
supporting legislation that favored rapists and child molesters.</TE>
<TE>   The incident so angered Molina, who was a Villaraigosa supporter,
that she asked Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley to investigate. The D.A.'s
office decided not to prosecute anyone involved, but Cooley's report
pointedly stated that the individuals responsible should be taken to
task in "the court of public opinion."</TE>
<TE>   Mindful of that possibility, Pacheco claimed credit for prodding
the agency staffer who knew about the attack calls to cooperate with
the district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   But none of this means the 14th District race has to get as dirty
as everyone fears. First, any candidates who play rough could wind up
losing as much voter support as they gain. Simply ponder the low
voter turnout in last week's statewide election, where so many
California voters were put off by Gov. Gray Davis' attacks on
Republican Bill Simon that they simply didn't vote for either man.</TE>
<TE>   Another reason the 14th District race may stay upbeat is the
presence of a popular nonpolitical candidate like Gonzales. He brings
the neophyte's sunny idealism to what could otherwise be a twilight
struggle among veteran political warhorses.</TE>
<TE>   Since retiring from professional boxing, Gonzales has worked as an
actor and motivational speaker, and he spends time coaching young
people at Hollenbeck Youth Center, the police-sponsored gym and
community center where he first learned to box.</TE>
<TE>   "I respect all of my opponents," Gonzales said. "That's why I'm
glad Antonio got into the race and why I told Nick I would be
running." Politically naive? Perhaps. But former boxers can make good
referees, reminding other contestants to refrain from low blows.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ten years ago, Roger Keith Coleman was executed in Virginia for rape
and murder, proclaiming his innocence to the end. He is one of
several prisoners who have been put to death in the U.S. in recent
years despite serious, unresolved doubts about their guilt.</LD>
<LD>   In Coleman's case, however, we could know for sure, if the state
would permit it. Semen recovered from the victim is sitting in a
laboratory freezer. If that sample were analyzed using new DNA
identification tests that have become available in the last few
years, we would find out beyond doubt whether Coleman was guilty or
innocent.</LD>
<LD>   Instead -- hard as it is to believe -- the biological evidence may
soon be destroyed by the state, without DNA testing.</LD>
<TE>   On Nov. 1, the Virginia Supreme Court affirmed a lower court
ruling that denied a request by several major newspapers to have that
test conducted. In the court's view, what the newspapers want is not
access to the evidence -- which is guaranteed by the 1st Amendment --
but "the ability to cause the biological material to be retested and
generate a new scientific report, thereby altering, manipulating,
and/or destroying existing evidence in order to create new evidence."</TE>
<TE>   Judging from previous cases, this decision means that the
murderer's semen -- whoever he is -- rather than being retested,
altered and manipulated, may now be burned.</TE>
<TE>   The logic of the Virginia Supreme Court's opinion, however, is
less troubling than the reaction of the Virginia attorney general's
office, which opposed DNA testing: "The bottom line," a spokesman
said, "is that in 1981, Roger Keith Coleman raped and murdered Wanda
McCoy. He was tried, convicted, sentenced and punished. And today the
Virginia Supreme Court has spoken."</TE>
<TE>   If prosecutors are sure of Coleman's guilt, why not take this
opportunity to prove it?</TE>
<TE>   The issue has come up in Virginia before, and the outcome was the
same.</TE>
<TE>   After Joseph O'Dell was executed in Virginia in 1997, the Catholic
Diocese of Richmond, Va., asked for permission to test DNA samples
that could determine his innocence or guilt.</TE>
<TE>   The state's objection in O'Dell's case was more to the point than
in Coleman's: If the test went badly for the state, prosecutors
argued, "it would be shouted from the rooftops that the Commonwealth
of Virginia executed an innocent man." The courts ordered the
evidence destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, dozens of death row inmates have been exonerated
-- by DNA evidence and otherwise -- and released. Some came within
hours of execution; most were cleared by sheer chance.</TE>
<TE>   This shocking state of affairs has led to moratoriums on
executions in Illinois and Maryland. It has been noted with concern
by a majority on the Supreme Court, including Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor, who said last year, "If statistics are any indication, the
system may well be allowing some innocent defendants to be executed."</TE>
<TE>   In Congress, a majority of the House of Representatives and 31
senators co-sponsored a bill, the proposed Innocence Protection Act,
that addresses the problem by setting minimum standards for capital
defense lawyers and guaranteeing access to DNA testing.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, in a decision now under appeal, a federal district
judge held the federal death penalty unconstitutional, saying it is
"fully foreseeable that in enforcing the death penalty a meaningful
number of innocent people will be executed who otherwise would
eventually be able to prove their innocence."</TE>
<TE>   In Virginia, the death penalty is enforced with regularity: 86
executions since 1977, second only to Texas. How many innocent people
have been killed in the process? If the commonwealth has its way,
we'll never know.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Virginia adopted a law to forestall future
investigations by authorizing the destruction of DNA samples
immediately after an execution.</TE>
<TE>   No one can deny that many innocent people have been sentenced to
death; scores have been exonerated and released. Nonetheless,
prosecutors argue that, somehow, all these errors are caught in time
and no innocent prisoners are actually put to death. "Where" they
say, "is the incontrovertible proof?"</TE>
<TE>   Well, in Coleman's case, at the state's insistence, that proof may
be about to go up in smoke.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, this fight is about fear of knowledge. It is
notoriously hard to investigate the guilt of a prisoner once he has
been executed, and Virginia's position in this case illustrates one
of the main reasons: State officials resist every step of the way.</TE>
<TE>   The Virginia attorney general may truly be confident of Coleman's
guilt. He may be right -- there is substantial evidence that Coleman
was guilty. Yet a victory by the newspapers in this case might have
set a precedent permitting newspapers, historians and other
investigators to reexamine evidence after other executions. With such
examination, over time, we might learn how many innocent defendants
are put to death. And that, apparently, is unacceptable to the
Commonwealth of Virginia.</TE>

<HD>Tide of Refugees Could Swamp War Effort</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Arthur C. Helton and Gil Loescher</AU>
<BD>Arthur C. Helton is a senior fellow at the Council on
Foreign Relations and author of "The Price of Indifference: Refugees
and Humanitarian Action in the New Century" (Oxford University Press,
2002). Gil Loescher is a senior fellow at the International Institute
for Strategic Studies.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the reams of recent news reports and analyses about Iraq, there
has been little discussion or preparation for the possibility of an
exodus of Iraqi refugees.</LD>
<LD>   Western policymakers ignore this potential problem at their peril.</LD>
<LD>   Massive cross-border flows of refugees pose a real risk to the
security of neighboring states. Left unattended, this would not only
create regional instability but also greatly complicate military
action against Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   Iraqi government persecution of Kurds, Shiites and other opponents
of the regime and U.N. sanctions against Iraq already have left more
than 1 million internally displaced in Iraq. These numbers are likely
to increase dramatically in the event of war. Neighboring states
probably would close their borders to refugees massing at their
frontiers.</TE>
<TE>   A prolonged bombing campaign would cause great hardship among an
economically weakened and vulnerable population, resulting in mass
flight. To hedge against the kind of instability that came with
refugee movements after the 1991 Gulf War, Turkey, Saudi Arabia,
Syria and other states probably would refuse entry to asylum seekers.</TE>
<TE>   There is also a real risk of internal displacements and refugee
outflows occurring in the aftermath of an overthrow of Saddam
Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   The possibility of post-conflict retribution, disorder and civil
strife among Iraq's various ethnic and religious groups cannot be
ruled out. Violent conflicts may break out among Shiites, Kurds and
Sunnis, as well as among smaller groups, such as Chaldean and
Assyrian Christians.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. relief and humanitarian agencies are working on mitigation
and contingency responses, but under considerable constraints. A
major problem was that the U.N. prohibited any public discussion of
plans to prepare for a refugee crisis in the region during Security
Council deliberations on weapons inspections.</TE>
<TE>   This meant that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees could not even appeal to donor governments for emergency
planning funds or formally consult with the military regarding
contingency planning.</TE>
<TE>   After several years of declining budgets, the agency's funding is
precarious, seriously affecting its ability to mobilize for a massive
humanitarian emergency.</TE>
<TE>   Lack of surplus capacity and tight staffing will make it difficult
to respond quickly and effectively. And security considerations may
make it impossible for the U.N. refugees commissioner's office and
other aid agencies to operate during a military campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Refugees have constituted one of the central strategic and
political challenges of nearly all Western military interventions in
recent years. Not only have refugees constituted a major strategic
objective, but they also have disrupted military plans as well as
local and regional political structures in surprising ways and have
become weapons of war, for example in Kosovo.</TE>
<TE>   An invasion of Iraq would require urgent early preparations to
deal effectively with the causes and consequences of mass
displacements.</TE>
<TE>   Strategic planners for the United Nations and Western governments
must begin to plan -- now.</TE>

<HD>'Safe Seats' Cheat the Voters</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>There wasn't much mystery last week about who would be elected to the
state Legislature or California's delegation to the U.S. House of
Representatives. Party leaders in the Legislature stacked the deck
last year when they drew new district lines to reflect population
shifts on the basis of the 2000 census.</LD>
<LD>   Those 153 districts were carved into enclaves of heavy Democratic
and Republican voter registration to provide "safe" seats. Maps in
hand before a single vote was cast, you could have picked the winner
in virtually every district -- 80 in the Assembly, 20 in the state
Senate and 53 in the House. Only five of the 153 were true contests.
All but one of the 49 California incumbents in Congress won by a
landslide, with at least 60% of the vote. The other, Rep. Lois Capps
(D-Santa Barbara), won with 59%. Democrats remain strongly in control
of all three houses.</LD>
<LD>   This cynical deal may serve the pols well, but it's bad for
California. It becomes virtually impossible to hold lawmakers
accountable at the next election. The Legislature is increasingly
polarized between Republican conservatives and liberal Democrats. In
spite of their majorities, Democrats need some GOP votes to pass the
budget and any other fiscal bill. That's why this year's budget was
deadlocked for two months beyond the deadline.</LD>
<TE>   It's in the public interest to have clear lines of opinion and
vigorous debate. But the Legislature is so fractured now, it's
virtually impossible to reach a compromise on any major issue,
particularly on spending and taxes. The result of Tuesday's election
will be even more gridlock.</TE>
<TE>   In most states, legislatures have the task of redrawing
legislative district boundaries and those of the state delegation to
the U.S. House, usually subject to gubernatorial approval. A few
legislatures have appointed commissions that do the job. In Iowa this
year, a nonpartisan bureau set the boundary lines for districts.</TE>
<TE>   California's districts were drawn to last until after the 2010
census. The silver lining, if any, is that good-government groups
have time to develop an alternative to legislators drawing their own
districts. There is a solution, but not one the legislators would
accept. They cherish the power to decide where district lines go,
even to skew them so that a potential challenger is put into a
neighboring district. Past ballot initiatives to give the job to an
independent commission were defeated in a flood of misleading attack
ads paid for by legislative leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Some activists talk of the Iowa method. That might be difficult in
California because the head of the comparable office, though serving
both Republicans and Democrats, is picked by the leaders of the party
in power. Although Iowa considers its procedure nonpartisan, it's
impossible to remove politics from the process. That isn't the goal.
The goal is to bring competition -- and a chance for serious debate
-- to legislative races.</TE>
<TE>   The discussion should begin now. Because it would require a
constitutional amendment to take away the Legislature's redistricting
power, there's no reason why the measure couldn't order the drawing
of new districts for the next election. That would return real
competition and accountability to the political process in
California.</TE>

<LD>Intelligence gathering has few "Eureka!" moments in which a
malefactor is discovered gripping a smoking gun. Since 9/11,
intelligence agencies have looked in vain for a link between Iraq and
Al Qaeda's attacks on New York and the Pentagon. Defense Secretary
Donald H. Rumsfeld says the failure to find a connection does not
mean it does not exist (in his words, the "absence of evidence is not
evidence of absence"), but the passage of time makes the discovery of
any connection less likely.</LD>
<LD>   There may have been contacts and conversations between Osama bin
Laden's terrorist group and the Baghdad regime after 9/11, but so far
the attacks themselves appear to be solely an Al Qaeda operation. An
informant for the Czech counterintelligence service claimed that
hijack leader Mohamed Atta met with an Iraqi intelligence official in
Prague, according to a report publicized by the Czech interior
minister. But that claim has been widely doubted by many officials,
Czech and foreign, and no significant new evidence is publicly known.
FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III said last April that his agency
"ran down literally hundreds of thousands of leads" in seeking
evidence to support the report and came up empty.</LD>
<TE>   The Bush administration should ensure that its requests for the
CIA and other agencies to hunt for links between Bin Laden and Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein are not interpreted as pressure to provide
evidence that does not exist. Intelligence and congressional sources
told Times reporters last month that senior Bush administration
officials were pressuring CIA analysts to tailor their assessments of
the Iraqi threat to help build a case against Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   A French judge who has spent two decades fighting Islamic and
Middle Eastern terrorists flatly declared, "We have found no evidence
of links between Iraq and Al Qaeda." Yet Rumsfeld says there is
"bulletproof" evidence that Al Qaeda members have been in Iraq
recently and for years have had contacts with Hussein's regime.
President Bush said of Hussein this month, "We know he's got ties
with Al Qaeda." European intelligence officials say that's doubtful,
since Hussein has gone out of his way to run a secular regime of the
kind that's poison to Bin Laden. Hussein and Al Qaeda share a mutual
hatred of America, but so far as is known the Iraqi dictator has not
provided weapons to terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq has left a long trail of bad deeds: invasions of Iran and
Kuwait, use of poison gas against its own citizens, attempts to shoot
down U.N.-authorized overflights that monitor compliance with
Security Council resolutions. These are all good arguments for the
tough stance the U.N. Security Council adopted Friday on inspecting
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Charges of Iraqi ties to 9/11,
without believable evidence, merely undercut Bush's case for military
action.</TE>

<LD>Have you noticed? Strangest thing. On TV now. Mainly news. Also
promos. Sentence fragments. Like this. Short word bursts. Like this.
Colorful verbs. Vanished. Whole sentences. Gone. Intelligent
discourse. Poof. How? What's happening? Sure, Americans always hurry.
Big-time. We hurry; therefore, we are. Gotta go.</LD>
<LD>   But. Now. More TV reporters talking funny. "President Bush in
Georgia today. Campaigning for Republicans." Cool? Hip? Not! "West
Coast ports. Back at work. Choking on cargo." Caffeine? New disease?
Contagious? Brain burps? Saving cell minutes? Also creeping
informality. We've used contractions forever. Slur speech too,
dontcha know. Also like abbreviations, acronyms: It's "fax," "e-mail"
and "nuke" 'cause they're faster than "facsimile," "electronic mail"
and "microwave." Now comes TV Qwik-Speak (QS). QS sounds informed,
dramatic, unburdened by elaboration. "Today. Off the Louisiana coast.
An oil slick, miles long. Moving toward shore." Affectation? Like
torn jeans? Sideways ball caps? Or just lazy?</LD>
<TE>   Admittedly, communicating in complete sentences with subjects,
verbs and objects, also adjectives, adverbs (and parenthetical
asides) takes time. And thought too. Ears hear words; they don't gulp
them like a lunch to-go. Ponder this: Whole thoughts and complete
sentences involve listeners more. They make us think, allow for
connections, perhaps even relate and respond to each other. It's the
difference between talking to or at someone.</TE>
<TE>   Careful word choice, apt alliteration, clever construction,
metaphors as warm as the hearth at Grandma's, they all add nuance and
lushness to thoughts and ideas. Such exchanges convey beyond words
and pictures. They make links, one to one, despite so many rapid,
bewildering changes, large and small, all around.</TE>
<TE>   Word bursts jar. They push people away. Impersonal. Superficial.
Distant. Like dashing through a gorgeous forest on flagstones. You
can do it. But what's to feel, savor and remember afterward? Life
spans lengthen but time's still short. Especially on TV. Our common
cultural touchstone. Where time is sliced too thin for thought. Izzit
better to be fast? Or comprehended?</TE>
<TE>   Very tiring, speaking staccato. Also listening. Reading staccato

<LD>What a difference eight years makes. In Tuesday's midterm election of
George W. Bush's first term, Democrats lost two and perhaps three
Senate seats and lost the one-seat advantage achieved when Sen. James
Jeffords of Vermont became an independent within a year of being
elected as a Republican. They also lost three seats in the House of
Representatives, rather than gaining the seven seats required to gain
control of that body.</LD>
<LD>   Eight years ago, in the midterm elections of Bill Clinton's first
term, Republicans gained nine seats to take control of the Senate and
an astounding 54 seats to take control of the House. There is no
doubt the voters rejected the scare tactics, obstructionism,
nonconstructive criticism and lack of vision exemplified by the
Democrats and embraced the leadership of President Bush and the
positive Republican message.</LD>

<TE>   Now that voters nationwide have given the green light to the Bush
war agenda, I hope they are ready for all the ugly stuff that's going
to come with it: increased terrorism, alienation from former allies,
more limits on our basic rights. Who wrote the quote about it being
"a time to dance on the edge of the crater"? Looks like we'll all be
doing that over the next few years. I hope we can keep our footing.</TE>

his war with Iraq, how will we pay for it? With tax cuts?</TE>

<HD>Robert Scheer Drops the Population Bomb</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As usual, Robert Scheer gets it half right when he focuses attention
on overpopulation as the core of most of the world's problems
("Playing Population-Explosion Politics," Commentary, Nov. 5). Every
crisis -- in the environment, education and unemployment, to name a
few -- is exacerbated by increasing population. But to discuss
population policy without taking on immigration policy represents the
height of folly.</LD>
<LD>   At least the political right is consistent in backing population
growth and open borders to ensure cheap labor and plentiful cannon
fodder. The political left, of which Scheer is a representative,
should put its head where it says its heart is and advocate closing
our borders. Shutting off the American "safety valve" is the quickest
way to foment revolution against the plutocrats in those countries
our immigrants are fleeing.</LD>
<LD>   Barry Dantzscher</LD>
<TE>   Van Nuys</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was heartening to read Scheer's commentary. There are many
important issues our pundits and policymakers need to address, of
course, but some of the problems we face -- overpopulation, wealth
concentration, environmental collapse -- are so fundamental to the
sort of world our children will inherit that their willful neglect
borders on the criminal. Unfortunately, in a world whose leaders are
more concerned with getting elected than with educating the public,
commentary such as Scheer's will probably amount to nothing more than
wasted ink.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Caldwell</TE>
<TE>   Venice</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Can President Bush ever do anything right according to Scheer? He
complains about "a foreign policy driven primarily by a domestic
agenda." In case Scheer does not realize it, I think someone should
tell him that Bush's job is not to be president of the world or the
U.N. but to do what is best for the U.S.</TE>

Cecilia Rasmussen wrote an outstanding feature on Ft. MacArthur and
its interesting history. One point of history not included was that
the facility was a reception center during World War II. Thousands of
men came there by Pacific Electric streetcar, cars and buses. They
were efficiently processed, given serial numbers, uniforms and then
shipped out for basic training at posts all over the U.S. The
reception center was on the lower reservation, which is now a marina.</LD>

<LD>My heartfelt sympathy goes out to the family of Grigory Burban, who
lost his life in the Moscow theater taken over by Chechen rebels
(Nov. 6). While I think many lives, including Burban's, might have
been saved had the Russians been better prepared to treat the
hostages affected by the gas pumped into the theater, I believe the
rebel action could have been avoided had the theater provided
adequate security for its patrons.</LD>
<LD>   Six months ago my wife and I were in the same theater, attending a
performance of "Nord-Ost," the production that was in progress when
the Chechen rebels staged their takeover. I recall entering the
theater prior to the performance and noting that there was no visible
security. That lack struck me as being odd, given the armed security
personnel I had grown accustomed to seeing at other public
gatherings. While we go out into the world at our own risk, I think
that performing arts spaces, no less than sports stadiums, need to
have the safety of their audiences uppermost in their minds and take
measures to discourage a repeat of the Moscow tragedy.</LD>

<LD>After reading "Nonvoters Express Disgust at Political System" (Nov.
6) I was disgusted. Do these people really think that by not voting
they are sending a message to the politicians? I would like to know
what their message is. They all sound like spoiled children who
didn't get their way.</LD>
<LD>   It's really a sad situation, because voting is the most important
activity in a democracy. History shows that when people take the time
to learn about the issues and candidates and vote, things do change.</LD>

<TE>   I can't believe how low the voter turnout is time after time.
Since I was a young girl accompanying my grandparents and parents to
vote, I have understood the importance of standing up and being
counted. I encountered many people who said they couldn't vote for
either candidate for governor. Silly me, I thought there were many
other items on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   I guess no one had an opinion on schools, water safety, trauma
centers or children. The complacency that has infected the voters of
California is despicable. Nothing will ever change if you don't at
least take the first step.</TE>
<TE>   Today I woke up and secession had not passed, so I wrote to Mayor
James Hahn and invited him to my neighborhood council meetings. I
will use my voice because I believe in this city, state and country.
We are so blessed to have some form of protest and a way to speak our
minds. All we have to do is take 15 minutes from one day. I take
responsibility for my government. Can't everyone do the same?</TE>

<TE>   Several years ago, while teaching at a California state
university, I required my students to register to vote, unless they
were under 18. I was aware of the very low voting rate among students
of college age. Unfortunately, because of some student complaints, I
had to drop the requirement. The new chair of women's studies (who
resigned later that year) said that the course I was teaching in
women's studies was not related to politics -- an absurd statement,
because the election results would affect women's lives.</TE>
<TE>   This event reminded me of my futile attempt to give out copies of
the Bill of Rights to eighth-grade students in an American history
class I was student-teaching in 1969. I was teaching the students
about the Constitution. I knew that polls had shown that people, when
presented with the Bill of Rights without it being called the Bill of
Rights, thought it was communist propaganda. My training teacher said
that I couldn't distribute the pamphlets because they were printed by
the ACLU, a "controversial organization."</TE>
<TE>   At that point I realized that I had a "trained incapacity" to
teach public school students and returned to school, where I obtained
my PhD.</TE>

<TE>   I voted Democratic for the first 22 years of my voting life. That
was, until this election. Every opportunity I had to vote for a
candidate who was neither a member of the Democratic nor Republican
Party, I did so. In 2002, the U.S. does not have a democracy but a
dictatorship. No, we don't have a wild-eyed, egomaniacal leader who
cuts off the arms and legs of any person who voices dissent. But our
citizens do not choose their leaders, just as the citizens of Iraq do
not choose their leadership. Americans can vote for either a Democrat
or a Republican, but because these are essentially the same people,
there is not any true choice. I will no longer vote for the lesser of
two evils.</TE>
<TE>   Only when America enacts stringent campaign-finance and
campaign-spending reform will true democracy rise in this land. If
there are strict caps on how much money can be raised and how much
can be spent in an election, then the playing field will be leveled
and the result will be the birth of new and competitive political
parties. When we have reform and multiple competitive parties, then
there will be real choice and true democracy in America for the first
time.</TE>

<LD>I believe that obtaining an education and constructing modernized
educational facilities are worthwhile endeavors. Unfortunately, those
responsible for the educational purse strings in California have an
insatiable appetite and an uncanny ability to mismanage money or make
it disappear, as with the Belmont Learning Complex. They continually
use the same phrase -- "it's for the kids" -- to garner the support
they need to obtain funds and ensure job security.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday's election was a clear indication of their expertise in
this arena. During each election, for as long as I care to remember,
propositions related to funds for education have abounded. I can only
hope that someday citizens will look more closely at this issue and
demand better accountability from those in charge.</LD>

<BD>Jason Berry, author of "Lead Us Not Into Temptation,"
is working on a book with Gerald Renner about the Vatican and
American Catholic Church.</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>Last month, four Vatican officials and four American bishops met in
Rome to revise the proposed zero-tolerance policy for sexually
abusive priests that an American bishops' conference adopted last
summer. Their instrument of retreat was the Code of Canon Law, an
archaic standard of justice ill suited to deal with the sex abuse
crisis facing the Roman Catholic Church. Survivors of clergy abuse
rightly protested the proposed revisions, claiming that they gut the
intent of the get-tough policy.</LD>
<LD>   Among other things, the group emphasized priests' rights of
presumed innocence, and it clarified the definition of sexual abuse.
The eight officials agreed to a 10-year statute of limitations on sex
abuse charges, which, under Canon 489, would allow a bishop to
destroy an accused priest's incriminating files, a change that would
surely complicate matters with law enforcement because many states
have longer time frames. The American bishops will vote on the
changes this week.</LD>
<LD>   Ironically, the Vatican's intervention came as Irish public
television aired "Cardinal Secrets," a documentary exposing how
Dublin church officials sheltered priests who had abused children
over the years. As the Irish government launched an investigation, a
justice minister likened the Code of Canon Law to "the rules of a
golf club."</LD>
<TE>   The American bishops' youth-protection charter, democratically
adopted by about 300 American bishops in Dallas last June, was not
perfect, but it provided something that the Roman Catholic Church
desperately needed: the influence of laypeople, a separation of
powers to mitigate the church hierarchy's entrenched secrecy. The
charter created a national lay review board, chaired by outgoing
Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating. The board has held hearings and has a
mandate to research the crisis. Lay boards would undertake a similar
mission at the diocesan level.</TE>
<TE>   The bishops took another solid step last week, naming Kathleen
McChesney, a top-ranking FBI official, as the head of the American
church's new Office for Child and Youth Protection.</TE>
<TE>   The plan adopted in Dallas also included a set of norms, or church
guidelines, subject to canon law and approval by Rome.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed revisions, however, appear to emasculate local boards
to advisory status. Rome wants only Catholics to serve, as if a board
would be weakened by, say, a Jewish therapist like Leslie Lothstein
of the Institute of Living in Hartford, Conn., a clinical
psychologist who has treated dozens of child-molesting priests.</TE>
<TE>   By shifting power to canonical standards, the Vatican has
unwittingly invited scrutiny of the church's core crisis: its lack of
oversight capacity. Democracy is not holy, but canon law has nothing
equivalent to independent prosecutors or watchdogs, like the General
Accounting Office, which investigates the government for Congress. An
egregious example of this deficiency in church governance happened at
the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, headed by Cardinal
Joseph Ratzinger. The body has historically monitored theologians.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, eight former seminarians of the Legion of Christ, a
religious order admired by Pope John Paul II, accused the director,
the Rev. Marcial Maciel Degollado, of sexually abusing them in Spain
and Rome in the 1950s and '60s. The men tried for years to reach the
pope, but he never responded to their letters.</TE>
<TE>   The accusers, a Spanish priest and seven Mexican laymen, followed
the Code of Canon Law to the letter, using experienced canon lawyers
from Mexico City and the Vatican. They accused Maciel of forgiving
their "sins" in confession. Abuse of the sacrament of penance is one
of the most serious delicts, or crimes, in the canonical code,
punishable by excommunication. Ratzinger allowed no testimony and
aborted the proceeding in 1999. Last spring, when Brian Ross of
ABC-TV's "20/20" approached the cardinal in front of his office in
Rome, seeking comment on the case, Ratzinger slapped him on the wrist
and refused to talk.</TE>
<TE>   Such secretive tribunals are a medieval system prone to abuse, as
Father John Bambrick learned. As a teenager, he was allegedly abused
by Father Anthony Eremito. Emboldened by the survivors' movement,
Bambrick learned that Eremito was a hospital chaplain in Texas and
complained to Cardinal Edward Egan of the New York archdiocese, where
Eremito had ministered for many years. Eremito resigned and was
suspended from the active priesthood.</TE>
<TE>   Not to be outdone, Eremito turned to Msgr. William Varvaro, a
former president of the Canon Law Society of America and a member of
the papal staff. Varvaro filed a canonical grievance against the
young priest for violating Eremito's right to privacy. "Surreally, I
was charged under 1717, the same canon used against perpetrators,"
said Bambrick. Although Bambrick's bishop cleared him after a secret
investigation, Egan's lay review board will not allow the young
priest to testify against the older priest who abused him and others.</TE>
<TE>   This muddle of a system bestirred Father Thomas Doyle, a former
canon lawyer at the Vatican Embassy in Washington and now an Air
Force chaplain, to issue on the Internet a critique of the revised
policy. In 1985, after researching the emerging sexual abuse
litigation against priests, Doyle had warned a canonists' convention
that pedophilia was "the greatest problem we in the church have faced
in centuries." His warning and a subsequent report on the emerging
crisis that he cowrote were ignored by the church hierarchy.</TE>
<TE>   "These [revised] norms return total control to [bishops] along
with glaring loopholes that can possibly allow proven sexual
offenders to either return to or continue in ministry," Doyle writes
on the Internet. "The lay review boards have no decisive power and
the potential exists to completely neutralize them.... This means
that the Vatican retains the power to control the process, to
reimpose the shroud of pathological secrecy on cases and to apply its
own procedural laws."</TE>
<TE>   As the weary bishops head toward a vote on the revised norms in
Washington, they are at a rare turning point. For years, the Vatican
tried to reduce the power of national bishops' conferences as the
American hierarchy issued visionary pastoral letters on nuclear arms
and economic ethics. But when the bishops confronted the sex abuse
crisis, Rome stood detached. Under pressure by the clergy-abuse
survivors, the American bishops came up with a plan that still has
the potential to work in many countries -- unless Rome undercuts it.
If that happens, the Roman Curia will hand a greater scandal to the
next pope.</TE>

<HD>A New Vision for the Valley</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Joel Kotkin</AU>
<BD>Joel Kotkin, a contributing editor of Opinion, is a
senior fellow at the Davenport Institute for Public Policy at
Pepperdine University and at the Milken Institute. He is writing a
book on the history of cities for Modern Library.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In its drive to become a city, the Valley became one. Not because the
secessionists barely carried the day in the Valley, but because the
attempted breakaway made the Valley -- and the rest of Los Angeles --
rethink what it is and what it might want to become.</LD>
<LD>   "The secession movement has given the Valley a sense of itself it
did not have," says Studio City resident Ken Bernstein, founder of
the Civic Forum, a nonpartisan group that held numerous forums on
secession around the city. "It was basically a movement about
identity and respect."</LD>
<LD>   Today, Valleyites are more aware their home has troubles that,
albeit not as severe as those over the hill, are serious and
distinctly urban. Its crime rate is rising, jobs are leaving and
there's an increasing dissension that comes with its growing
diversity.</LD>
<TE>   At the same time, with the growth-release valve closing off in
such attractive suburban areas as Ventura County, the Valley, with
its existing infrastructure and amenities, could be an ideal site for
the development of a new post-suburban structure.</TE>
<TE>   This new idea of the Valley was already emerging through the
Vision 2020 project, sponsored by the Economic Alliance of the San
Fernando Valley, a business group. A crucial issue for the project is
how to accommodate new population growth, expected to continue at
approximately 1% a year, without destroying the long-established
single-family neighborhoods that define the Valley's middle class.</TE>
<TE>   The answer may be the construction of "urban villages" -- dense
multiuse centers along major thoroughfares and intersections
throughout the Valley. The viability of this kind of development,
which need not be more than two or three stories high, is evident in
retail-pedestrian-oriented districts like Sherman Oaks, Toluca Lake
and Studio City.</TE>
<TE>   These villages could accommodate the three major social groups
expected to grow most rapidly in the Valley. One is the elderly,
including many homeowners, who may want to stay in the area but have
no need for a big home and might prefer to live within walking
distance of basic services. The Valley, once primarily a place for
families, is graying rapidly. In the last decade, its median age rose
from 34 to 38, while the percentage of people over 65 swelled by 28%.</TE>
<TE>   Another group is "nonfamily" households, singles or couples
without children, many in their 30s and 40s, who are buying smaller
homes in places like Van Nuys. This is one of the fastest-growing
population groups in Los Angeles, as well as in other metropolitan
areas. Priced out of the Westside and at a point in life when they
might enjoy a village atmosphere, these households, despite the
Manhattanite images on television, favor less-dense living areas over
inner cities.</TE>
<TE>   The third and perhaps most important group is working- and
middle-class immigrants, many of whom cannot afford the Valley's
steadily rising housing prices. For them, well-conceived denser
development near transit stops makes excellent sense. So, too, would
the development of Latino, Asian or Middle Eastern retail centers,
which would add to the Valley's existing cultural amenities.</TE>
<TE>   Unhappily, how to realize this vision was not a subject in the
secession campaign. The pro-secession crowd never articulated a
compelling vision for their proposed city. For the most part, they
simply offered up the lame ideal of a more efficiently run Phoenix, a
vision that didn't exactly inspire Valleyites to man the barricades.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of their defeat, perennial secessionist leaders like
Richard Close and Jeff Brain need to step aside and let others create
a more viable vision. The core secessionist appeal -- the Valley of
yesteryear -- cannot work as long as the clock runs forward.</TE>
<TE>   But this doesn't mean that the enormous vitality of grass-roots
politics that Close and Brain, to their credit, helped unleash should
be allowed to die out. The diversity and spunk of some 90 council
candidates in the Valley was an inspiring affirmation of democracy.
They could be important forces in reshaping the long-term future not
only of the Valley but also of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps nowhere will their role be more critical than in the
northeast Valley. Supporters of the status quo will claim that a
majority of residents in this largely Latino area voted against
secession. True, but with a caveat.</TE>
<TE>   Even after a relentless anti-secession campaign supported by paid
political workers, around 40% of these voters still wanted to break
away from L.A. They apparently didn't buy the notion, embraced by the
LA Weekly, that secession was a right-wing, racist conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   Today, these pro-secession voters and their would-be Valley
leaders, many of them small-business owners, make up the first strong
grass-roots opposition to the kind of machine politics that has long
disfigured L.A. Latino politics. Two of the candidates from the
Valley election, Oscar Mendoza and Jose Ray Garcia, plan to form an
organization to battle for the economic and civic improvement of
working-class Latino areas both in and outside the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   These activists are natural-born leaders of an urban-village
movement. Unlike downtown's Latino politicians, who tend to be
second- or third-generation Mexican Americans closely associated with
the Democratic Party, they tend to be first-generation immigrants
from other parts of Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a real difference between this new group and the existing
people," explains Mendoza, a native of Mexico's Jalisco state and a
small-business owner. "We tend to be people who have their own homes
and businesses. We are more entrepreneurial and don't want to rely on
government services."</TE>
<TE>   There is a modest precedent for this kind of political approach in
the city of San Fernando, where Latino machine candidates were
recently tossed out in favor of grass-roots activists. Today, San
Fernando is a model for a restored, functioning and economically
viable Latino-majority city, with a renewed village core.</TE>
<TE>   If the urban-village ideal takes root, the sense of empowerment
and vitality it creates in the Valley could be significant as well
for the vast majority of Los Angeles County, which, after all, is
more Valley-like -- diverse, middle class and multiethnic -- than the
better-known constituencies of downtown, the Eastside barrios,
South-Central or the posh parts of the Westside.</TE>
<TE>   If so, the political ideals of Valley secession -- greater local
control of planning, better delivery of services, improvements in the
entrepreneurial climate and increased deployment of city resources
for neighborhood, as opposed to grandiose downtown, development --
could become county ideals.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley, once a laggard, could be the vanguard for such change.
The secessionists represent roughly a third of the city's electorate.
With a more diverse, enlightened leadership and a clearly defined
vision, the onetime insurrectionists may yet reshape our now
dysfunctional metropolis.</TE>

secessionists stirred up an important debate but failed to provide a
compelling direction for the city they hoped to create. But with the
right leadership, the Valley could be an ideal place to try a new
model of post-suburban planning.</CP>

affairs at Georgetown University and a senior fellow at the Council

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Against its instincts, the Bush administration succumbed to
international pressure last week, signing on to a U.N. plan for
disarming Iraq that omitted some of the tougher provisions Washington
had initially sought. Rather than having a free hand to attack Iraq
if Saddam Hussein thwarts the weapons inspectors likely to head soon
to Baghdad, the U.S. has agreed to return to the U.N. Security
Council for consultations before taking military action.</LD>
<LD>   Although the tortuous negotiations leading to passage of the
resolution focused exclusively on Iraq, they illuminate how much the
global landscape has changed since George W. Bush took office. Rather
than rallying behind U.S. leadership, as the world's democracies have
done since World War II, most members of the Security Council backed
France and locked arms to resist the U.S. The sobering reality is
that America's overweening power, combined with the administration's
unabashed unilateralism, is setting much of the world against the
United States. With an American Goliath on the loose -- and the
prospects for self-restraint remote, at best -- the globe needs a
David.</LD>
<TE>   The increasing U.S. isolation on the world stage stems from a rare
coincidence of international and domestic conditions. Since the
disintegration of the Soviet Union and the collapse of the Russian
economy, the United States has lacked a competitor capable of pushing
back. Japan has been stuck in a prolonged recession. China, with an
economy smaller than California's, has aspirations but not the
capability to back them up. And the European Union has been
preoccupied with its own agenda -- the introduction of a single
currency, enlarging the union and stabilizing the Balkans. There has
been no counterpoise to U.S. power.</TE>
<TE>   America's domestic landscape is similarly out of kilter. The
centrist wing of the Republican Party is rapidly disappearing.
Liberal internationalists like Brent Scowcroft, Henry Kissinger and
the president's father are still around, but they have been
outflanked by the party's neoconservative and neoisolationist
extremes. In theory, these two ascendant wings of the party should
check each other; they share little common ground on foreign affairs.
The neoconservatives favor the unfettered projection of U.S. power
and want to recast the international system in America's image. The
neoisolationists prefer a more hands-off approach to the world,
enabling the country to focus on matters closer to home and avoid
entanglement in distant troubles.</TE>
<TE>   This ideological divide was amply evident from the beginning of
Bush's presidency until Sept. 11, with the administration regularly
oscillating between unilateralist and isolationist impulses. One day,
the Pentagon would announce that it was beefing up the military and
strengthening U.S. primacy; the next, the White House would proclaim
its intention to step back from the Middle East peace process,
withdraw U.S. troops from the Balkans and focus attention on
relations with Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that the terrorist threat has effectively silenced
the neoisolationist wing, expunging restraint from the Republican
vocabulary and leaving the unilateralists unchecked. Bush appears to
have become a convert, abandoning his initial goal of scaling back
U.S. foreign commitments in favor of the unremitting effort needed to
prevail in a "conflict between good and evil."</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic Party ought to be the last line of defense,
preventing the administration from pursuing policies that are serving
only to stoke anti-American sentiment and distance the United States
from the international community. But it has folded its tent since
Sept. 11, worried that taking on Bush is too risky amid a public mood
still tinged with patriotism and fear. In the lead-up to the midterm
elections, Democrats criticized Bush's handling of the economy, but
they gave him a blank check on foreign affairs -- and succeeded only
in losing control of the U.S. Senate. Now that Democrats are in the
minority in both the House and Senate, they will be even less capable
of playing a restraining role.</TE>
<TE>   There is no wealth of worthy candidates to be America's David. In
the recent standoff at the U.N., France proved able to moderate the
U.S. position largely because Paris wields a veto at the Security
Council. In other settings, France simply would not have the
diplomatic weight to check U.S. power.</TE>
<TE>   There is really only one viable candidate for constraining an
America that has lost a sense of its own bounds: a collective Europe.
The European Union is militarily inferior to the United States and
still struggling to define the character of its union as well as
speak with a single voice on the world stage. Nonetheless, the size
of its economy is comparable to America's and its population
significantly larger, giving it the clout to serve as a
counterweight.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Europe and America have a long history together and
are not that far apart on some of the key issues of the day. In the
recent U.N. debate over Iraq, for example, the distance between
Washington and Paris was as much about form as substance. The French
were seeking not to block an attack against Iraq but to give
diplomacy a chance and to make military action legitimate through
collective approval, should the use of force prove necessary. The
more the EU is able to persuade the United States to play by the
rules of consultation and consensus, the more Washington will find
itself in a world that welcomes rather than resents U.S. leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Europeans will run considerable risk by steadfastly confronting
America on its foreign policy. Although the Bush administration did
back down under French pressure at the U.N., it has generally been
dismissive of Europe's objections to Washington's defection from the
Kyoto Protocol on climate change, the international criminal court,
the Antiballistic Missile Treaty and other multilateral pacts.</TE>
<TE>   Should Europe continue to dig in its heels, the emerging
transatlantic rift could well become a permanent divide. But with
America undermining the multilateral order that both sides of the
Atlantic worked so hard to put in place after World War II, the EU
must run that risk. During the last century, America tamed Europe and
righted its course. It now behooves Europe to repay the debt in kind.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Even predictions of a record-low voter turnout last Tuesday in
California couldn't dim the jolt of energy I usually get when I vote.
My enthusiasm felt a bit uncool -- excited by this governor's race?
-- or, at the least, unwarranted.</LD>
<LD>   But I like to vote. I enjoy the act from beginning to end -- the
break from the day's writing, the walk down the street, the fact that
an art gallery becomes a polling site, the list with all my
neighbors' names and addresses, the fun of the card-punching, the
old-fashioned slot for the ballots, the newfangled "I voted" stickers
(I have to confess) and the three-block walk back home. I even like
the potentially threatening sounds of card-punching in the adjacent
booths. No matter the outcome, I get a charge out of the act of
voting.</LD>
<LD>   Then the predictions came true -- barely half of the state's
registered voters showed up -- and our small but lovely voting
rituals came under attack again, as pundits issued the usual calls to
switch to mail-in or Internet ballots to make voting easier. Amid the
cries of "What is to be done?" one of the most popular solutions is
not to go to the polls at all. Oregon converted to vote-by-mail for
the 2000 election, and counties in Washington and Colorado and cities
from Denver to Burbank have been trying it.</LD>
<TE>   We all realize that Americans don't just fail to vote because it
isn't easy enough, and that tinkering with the act itself won't
necessarily solve the rampant civic apathy, and the disenchantment
with politics, at the heart of the problem. I agree, however, that
the act of voting does need serious reform. I also fear that voting
at one's computer desk moves us in exactly the wrong direction.</TE>
<TE>   What we should do instead is make election day a national holiday.
How and when and where we vote is important. We should make voting
more of a big deal, not less, because how we experience voting -- the
culture we create around this act -- says a great deal to us about
our commitment to civic engagement, and can either nourish or
discourage it.</TE>
<TE>   Voting by mail, in fact, hasn't increased turnout that
significantly. How could it? Making voting easier is an excellent
idea -- and setting aside the day to just vote would do that. But you
are not going to bestir great crowds of people to vote by making this
vital civic act even less meaningful, more atomistic and less
community-based than it already is.</TE>
<TE>   Election day through much of the 1800s was a sort of big sprawling
free-for-all, with parades and speeches and bands, as well as
fistfights and gambling. Businesses spontaneously shut down. Much
drinking was involved. We've made some improvements to the electoral
experience since then -- I, for one, appreciate that women can now
vote -- but would that at least a few Americans still cared enough
about the process to get rousing drunk. How about barbecues or
potlucks or whatever style of party, however sober or not, you
prefer?</TE>
<TE>   With an election day holiday, we'll need our own rituals. How
about events all afternoon to vent the day's passions of hope and
disappointment -- debates, costume parties, dramatic readings,
dancing, brisk backyard November ballgames or sitting around and
watching "The Candidate" or "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" or "The
American President" or "Air Force One" while cheering and/or making
snide comments? Come nighttime, how about flooding the cafes and bars
to watch the returns, or just heating up vast numbers of pizzas and
gathering around home-sized TVs to channel-surf together, for hours,
while the close races crawl to a finish.</TE>
<TE>   Think Super Bowl Sunday. Election Tuesday, too -- an event that
concerns even those of us who don't care much about football --
should be a day of great national celebration with an aggressive
undercurrent of partisanship. Shouldn't the day, in a democracy, that
we choose who will govern be a day as rife with collective rituals?
Isn't this day at least as worthy of national observance as George
Washington's birthday, Columbus Day, Veterans Day or Thanksgiving --
all of which are more contested as national experiences? And wouldn't
our kids, if they grew up feasting all day, whooping it up and
staying up late to watch the outcome, be more inclined as adults to
believe and assume they should go to the polls? It would be at least
as effective a route to civic awareness, I'm betting, as flying a
flag on the family SUV.</TE>
<TE>   A rich election-day culture in itself might not stem the rising
tide of civic apathy and distrust that makes us all want to waste our
vote and not pay our taxes and opt out of jury duty and, overall, say
to ourselves that government is them and not us. But it might help.</TE>
<TE>   The one year, since I turned 18, that I didn't enjoy voting was
the year I traveled out of the country and had to vote absentee by
mail. It was a chore; it felt like filling out insurance forms. But I
like to vote, and my friends like to vote, too, and we all say that
what we truly like about it -- the source of that jolt we feel -- is
the experience of walking or driving or biking to and back from the
polls amid the day's stream of voters. The act infuses us with a
civic-mindedness -- brief but very tangible -- that many of us
experience far too rarely.</TE>
<TE>   If a vote-by-mail initiative appears on the next California
ballot, I'll vote against it, because democracy deserves election
rituals more exciting than putting a stamp on an envelope or hitting
"Enter." It deserves a party.</TE>

<BD>Barry Rosen was the last U.S. press attache in Iran. He
is the executive director of external affairs at Teachers College,
Columbia University.</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>According to the BBC, Abbas Abdi, a mastermind of the storming and
takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Iran 23 years ago, has been arrested.
I was one of the 52 American embassy officials and civilians he and
his student-activist supporters held hostage that Nov. 4 and for 443
days thereafter. Has justice, at long last, arrived?</LD>
<LD>   Ironically, Abdi was reportedly arrested Nov. 4, which Iran still
celebrates as the "Day of Fighting Global Arrogance." He was jailed
in a crackdown by the Iranian judiciary on polling organizations that
have been producing reports disliked by hard-liners. One such poll
recently showed that Iranians overwhelmingly support a new and open
relationship with the United States.</LD>
<LD>   I'm not sure whether Abdi's polling organization, which was closed
down before his arrest, had anything to do with that poll. But I'm
certain of this: He should be freed.</LD>
<TE>   How, you may ask, can I support a man who made my life and others'
miserable and, at times, hopeless?</TE>
<TE>   Because Abdi has turned his life around. He is now a prominent
figure in Iran's reformist movement.</TE>
<TE>   I met Abdi in August 1998. It was the first meeting of a former
hostage and hostage-taker since the end of the embassy takeover in
January 1981. I was terribly frightened that I was making a huge
mistake in meeting the man who had not only imprisoned me and other
Americans but had also caused the arrest of any Iranian who had ever
dealt with the U.S. Embassy. In seizing the embassy's confidential
files, the student-activists and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
hard-liners had wiped out any possibility of a more moderate
opposition emerging to challenge their defiantly undemocratic
theological state.</TE>
<TE>   Our meeting at the Paris headquarters of the U.N. Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization was ostensibly about the future
of U.S.-Iranian relations. But Abdi and I soon began to talk about
other things, like family. My wife and daughter accompanied me, and
Abdi was gracious and kind to them, especially when my daughter came
down with a serious illness.</TE>
<TE>   Thereafter, we often met for meals and attempted to speak candidly
to each other about our experiences during the embassy takeover. I
told him how bitter I and some other Americans remained over being
held hostage, over how our families had suffered and over how Abdi
had given Khomeini carte blanche to eliminate a politically viable
opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Abdi spoke less about his personal life than about the change in
his political views since 1981. He was now a journalist, political
analyst and activist for change. Although still a devout Muslim, he
said he no longer believed in the autocratic Islamic Republic of Iran
but instead wanted a reformed, democratically run Iran infused with
the spirit of Islam. He had become a major supporter of reform
President Mohammad Khatami.</TE>
<TE>   On each of the three days I saw Abdi, he presented me with a gift:
an Iranian mosaic box, a new book on politics in Iran and a small
prayer rug. The gifts were his way of saying he was my host once
again, but this time he was making up for his behavior in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Abdi was also trying to show me that people can change and that he
had a higher purpose in life. The night before he departed for
Tehran, he stood up at a gathering and apologized for what he and the
others had done to the Americans and their families. He spoke
directly to my wife, Barbara, and my daughter, Ariana, as if he were
totally alone with them.</TE>
<TE>   Next morning, as we said our goodbyes, we looked each other in the
eyes. I warned him to be careful.</TE>
<TE>   I thought he had been. But Abdi's urge to reform Iran may have
gotten the best of him. I will never be able to avenge the pain I
suffered during my captivity in Tehran, but Iran needs to change, and
Abdi needs to be free. Only with selfless men like him can Iran move
toward a more democratic society.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A year after 343 firefighters died trying to save lives in the World
Trade Center, at a time when beefcake calendars of macho firemen
decorate many a women's dorm, a legendary fire crew is at risk of
being disbanded for inappropriate titillation.</LD>
<LD>   Monika Miller is the sole woman on the Los Padres Hot Shots, a
band of wild-land firefighters stationed in the Los Padres National
Forest above Santa Barbara. This summer, she and her fellow crew
members voted on which pictures they'd use to decorate their two
"crew buggies" -- the claustrophobic 10-passenger trucks they use to
travel to wildfires anywhere in the West. Miller taped shots of
breaking waves from Surfer magazine beside her seat. The men took
scissors to Maxim magazine. With Miller's approval, pictures of cold
beer and hot women wriggling their barely covered rear ends went up
on the rigs' ceiling and walls.</LD>
<LD>   At 29, Miller is probably too young to remember when Madonna was
scandalous, let alone what bra burning was supposed to symbolize. The
pictures, she says, didn't offend her. But someone outside the crew
got a peek and did take offense -- and photographs. "X-rated Pinups
Steam Up the Forest," read a typically hyperbolic headline in the
local press.</LD>
<TE>   Down came the pictures. Then, arguing that the trucks' dubious
decor reflected widespread abuse against female Forest Service
employees in California, a former employee who monitors sexual
harassment claims in the wake of several anti-discrimination lawsuits
began pressuring the agency to disband the crew and dump its bosses.</TE>
<TE>   The blowup has the insular U.S. Forest Service buzzing like a
startled diamondback. It also offers insight into why peace remains
tenuous in America's mixed-gender workforce, where men still do
stupid things, old-school feminists refuse to abandon outdated
scorched-earth tactics, and too many employers overcompensate for
past discrimination by treating any hint of wounded sensibilities
with frenzied overkill. The ironic result is institutionalized
inequality -- to the detriment of men and women.</TE>
<TE>   No one who has worked for the Forest Service, as I did for five
fire seasons in the 1970s, can doubt that the agency, run for a
century by rural, conservative men, could be antagonistic to some of
the women -- often urban, liberal women -- bravely integrating it.
And while things are better now (the top position at the Los Padres
National Forest is held by a woman), I'm sure some bosses and workers
still treat women colleagues more harshly -- or gingerly -- because
they aren't men.</TE>
<TE>   That's why conversations with Miller and other female veterans of
the Los Padres Hot Shots left me hoping that -- bonehead posting of
pictures aside -- the rest of the working world catches up to that
crew's egalitarian policies before my two daughters enter the labor
force.</TE>
<TE>   Women like Miller can't imagine a time when an employee might shut
up and take abuse because of her gender, and they have no patience
with would-be protectors. What she wants from those who would act in
her interests, she says, is what the crew gives her: respect. "I'm
treated as Monika. As a worker. As somebody who's going to pound
dirt."</TE>
<TE>   Which isn't to say that, by some definitions of the word, she's
not "harassed."</TE>
<TE>   "We all are," Miller says. "It's part of the job. Part of life.
That's the fun."</TE>
<TE>   Sound like a "hostile work environment"? Consider that concept
from a Hot Shot's perspective. At its least pleasant, wild-land
firefighting means taking off on a moment's notice to fight a
conflagration on, say, Mt. San Jacinto near Palm Springs. Around
noon, you spill out of your buggy and hike uphill to the fire. In
118-degree heat. Without a trail. Wearing heavy gear, including
canteens that hold less water than your thirst craves. For 10 or 16
or even 24 hours you hack, grub and chain-saw along a wall of flames,
dodging rocks bigger than your hard hat, breathing wind-whipped
embers, maybe grabbing a couple of hours sleep beside a smoldering
stump before starting over again. Eager to cull weakness and rightly
viewing whiners as a safety threat, bosses harangue and colleagues
haze ("Oh, my!" gasp folks who work at a comfortable desk).</TE>
<TE>   There aren't many reasons to take this job. One is money. With
hazardous-duty pay, it's possible to earn as much in a five- or
six-month fire season as many blue-collar workers earn in a year.
Another is the rush. At its all-too-rare best, wild-land firefighting
is an adventure sport. Finally, there's the almost familial
camaraderie. Burning to death is painful. Crews count on each other.
Morale has to run high. Which means crew leaders must forge more than
muscles.</TE>
<TE>   The female Hot Shots I talked to said they were prouder of their
time on the Los Padres crew than anything else they have achieved.
Diane Pryce is now an air-tactical supervisor in Utah, flying over
fires to make sure retardant drops hit their marks and crews stay
safe. Working for the "shots," she says, instilled an attitude -- "Be
professional and pull your own weight" -- that has earned her respect
at every step as she advanced to become the first woman smoke jumper
in California and then Alaska, following a Los Padres Hot Shot who
became the first female smoke jumper in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   It's telling, though, that Pryce does not weigh the worth of the
crew and its leaders solely by what they have done for her gender.
"I've watched them make men, good men, out of a lot of boys," she
says.</TE>
<TE>   The Forest Service brass for California are still weighing what to
do about the crew-buggy affair. They have reprimanded the Hot Shots'
leaders and ordered statewide training to make it clear that sexual
harassment won't be tolerated. They also launched an investigation.
If it turns out that someone did something worse than post raunchy
pictures -- something that actually hurt an employee or made it
harder for a woman to do her job -- the agency should discipline the
culprit accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   But before firing good leaders or disbanding a whole crew because
a few critics are offended by pictures they had no reason to see,
Forest Service muckety-mucks should talk to the women who say the Los
Padres Hot Shots made them better firefighters -- indeed, better
people. The Forest Service, as a federal agency, should set an
example for the working world by judging the Los Padres crew not on
such abstract criteria as perceived sexism but by how it treats the
individual men and women willing to endure its unadulterated
toughening rituals -- which, paradoxically, prove gentling in the
end.</TE>

<HD>Amazon Writes a Drama in Canada</HD>
<DH>Booksellers, usually protected from foreign rivals, are
irked by lack of government action against U.S. e-tailer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Streitfeld</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>VICTORIA, Canada</DL>
<LD>It used to be easy to identify Canadians. They were quiet,
law-abiding folks, partial to Wayne Gretzky's hockey, Margaret
Atwood's novels and Leonard Cohen's music. They shopped at Hudson's
Bay Co. stores and knew who the Canadian prime minister was. They had
Canadian passports.</LD>
<LD>   To keep Canadian culture as Canadian as possible, the government
erected a multitude of barriers. One was that a non-Canadian couldn't
own a book publisher or distributor. The fear was that an outsider
would promote the novels of John Grisham, say, over domestic talent.</LD>
<LD>   Jeff Bezos, founder and controlling shareholder of Web retailer
Amazon.com, was born in New Mexico and lives in Seattle. Yet ever
since he launched a Canadian Web site in June, he's been one of the
biggest booksellers in Canada.</LD>
<TE>   Canadian booksellers are annoyed with Bezos but furious with their
government, which they say is treating the billionaire entrepreneur
like a native. They want a federal court to restore those once-sharp
distinctions between what is local and foreign.</TE>
<TE>   "Amazon has the best of both worlds," said Dave Hill of Munro's
Books, one of the most prominent independent stores in the country.
"It has the benefits and the power of being a Canadian company
without any of the responsibilities."</TE>
<TE>   The cultural laws were drawn up before Internet retailing was even
a notion.</TE>
<TE>   "Technology has blurred the edges of commerce," lamented Hill.
"How does one define Canadian in the Internet era?"</TE>
<TE>   The Net long has been a modernizing force in developing as well as
politically repressive countries. China is finding it impossible to
control the Net and the news and ideas it brings. Artisans around the
world use Web sites to sell directly to U.S. and European consumers.</TE>
<TE>   In industrialized countries, the Net is having an equally
pronounced but less noticed effect.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an extraordinarily powerful weapon for breaking down
national cultures," said Mel Hurtig, author of "The Vanishing
Country: Is It Too Late to Save Canada?" "Canadians like Americans,
but they don't want to become Americans."</TE>
<TE>   With one-tenth the population of the United States, most of its
citizens speaking English and living within 100 miles of the border,
Canada has had to fight to maintain any sort of home-grown culture.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last three decades, a variety of measures have been put
in place to fund local artists and arts organizations, including
publishers, and to keep the blockbusters from Hollywood and the
bestsellers from New York from complete domination.</TE>
<TE>   Canadian songs, for instance, are required to make up a minimum of
35% of radio stations' airplay each week. At least 60% of TV
programming must be produced by Canadians. Foreigners cannot own more
than 49% of a book publisher or distributor.</TE>
<TE>   When the tools of cultural dispersal were physical, the laws did
what they were intended to do. A plan by U.S. bookstore chain Borders
Group Inc. to open a superstore in Toronto in 1996 was nixed by the
government.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the store's majority owners would have been Canadian,
the government worried that Borders' computerized inventory system
would give less exposure to "Canadian stories, Canadian books,
Canadian authors," one government official said.</TE>
<TE>   An attempt this year by a U.S. bookstore chain to open an outlet
in the airport at Halifax, Nova Scotia, also foundered, booksellers
here say.</TE>
<TE>   What allowed Amazon to proceed was its virtuality. The company has
no offices or employees in Canada. Warehousing and shipping are
contracted out to a division of the Canadian postal service. The Web
site, Amazon.ca, might appear Canadian, but it floats in the no man's
land of cyberspace.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Passing Critical Tests</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Canadian Heritage decided that Amazon was
neither establishing a Canadian business nor acquiring control of an
existing one -- the two triggers for review. The Web site literally
was beyond the law.</TE>
<TE>   "This was fairly black and white in our estimation," said Heritage
spokesman Len Westerberg, although he acknowledged, "Maybe it's a
little colorful for other people."</TE>
<TE>   The Heritage ruling brought together two traditional foes: the
Canadian Booksellers Assn., made up of 1,000 independent stores, and
the country's sole bookselling chain, Indigo Books &amp; Music Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "We still don't hug," said CBA President Todd Anderson. "But in
this case, we agree that the government isn't doing its job."</TE>
<TE>   The CBA and Indigo have jointly filed suit in the Federal Court of
Canada, seeking a declaration that Amazon has established a new
business in Canada. If the booksellers pass that hurdle, the
Department of Canadian Heritage would take up the issue of whether
Jeff Bezos is Canadian.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a cop-out to say Amazon isn't really in business in Canada,"
Anderson said. "They have inventory here. The government is going to
have to stand up and put the big-boy pants on and decide whether this
is good or bad."</TE>
<TE>   Amazon officials say the Amazon.ca Web site, despite not being
owned by Canadians, is one of the best things to happen to Canadian
culture in a long time.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're doing is helping Canadian publishers, Canadian
authors, Canadian artists reach out not only to Canadians but all
across the world because Amazon.ca will make Canadian products
available to people all over the world," Bezos said in June. He
declined to be interviewed for this story.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest, most aggressive and most innovative e-commerce
company, Amazon sees international expansion as a key to growth. It
owns one of the two big online book sites in Britain and operates the
other. Germany, Japan and France have their own Amazon Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   In the year before Amazon.ca was started, the company says,
250,000 Canadian customers bought from the U.S. Web site. By
providing direct access to Canadian material and eliminating customs
delays, Amazon hopes to make deeper inroads into the $2-billion
Canadian book market.</TE>
<TE>   Although Amazon didn't break out Canadian sales in its recent
third-quarter report, sales in the North American books, music and
video division rose 17%. In earlier quarters, the unit's growth had
been minimal.</TE>
<TE>   Amazon is famous for having lost billions of dollars in its short
life. It can't be recouping much of those losses in Canada, where it
has been engaging in a price war with Chapters, the online division
of the Indigo chain.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Feeling the Competition</TE>
<TE>   At Bolen Books, a 27-year-old store in a Victoria shopping mall,
customers have started coming in with computer printouts of pages
from Amazon, asking whether Bolen will supply the same book at the
same price. Amazon discounts can be as high as 40% on a few
bestsellers, although many older titles aren't discounted.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to explain that we don't match prices," said co-owner
Samantha Holmes. "We try to tell them what we have to offer -- that
we're a locally owned, family-run business. That we employ 60 people
here, pay taxes here, give to their baseball teams, support their
hospitals. Sometimes that convinces people."</TE>
<TE>   But it doesn't convince all of them. Special orders at the store
are down about 30% since Amazon.ca started.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a real long-term business threat," Holmes said. "If we were
going to expand our Web site, that's stifled."</TE>
<TE>   The Web is a seductive place, where promises are easy to make but
can be hard to fulfill. The hottest book in Canada at the moment is
Yann Martel's "Life of Pi." Last month it won the Mann Booker Prize,
the most prestigious literary award in the British commonwealth,
affirming the vitality of Canadian writing. Bolen sold 144 copies in
two days.</TE>
<TE>   The publisher said it would be weeks before more were available.
But Amazon was telling its customers it could ship in two to three
days. Holmes ordered one, trying to determine whether the publisher
was playing favorites.</TE>
<TE>   After a week, Amazon sent her an e-mail saying it would be several
weeks before copies came in. Meanwhile, Bolen's copies arrived early.
It was a modest victory for physical stores.</TE>
<TE>   "We're adaptable. We'll be OK," Holmes said. "But why after 27
years are we still fighting and fighting and fighting for our place?
I suppose business just isn't fair."</TE>
<TE>   If the booksellers lose their request for government review, they
say, soon the cultural laws will be further eroded. Indigo is losing
money, and there probably aren't many Canadian companies that would
like to acquire it. A much better prospect to buy Indigo is the U.S.
chain Barnes &amp; Noble Inc., which would be able to argue that Amazon
already was operating north of the border.</TE>
<TE>   Pretty soon, said "Vanishing Country" author Hurtig, "someone will
walk into a big Barnes &amp; Noble in Toronto or Calgary and ask, 'What
do you have on the history of our prime ministers?' And they'll be
told, 'Would you be interested in a book on the great American
presidents? How about something on how the Americans won the second
world war single-handedly?' "</TE>
<TE>   Hurtig, a former chairman of the Committee for an Independent
Canada, thinks the battle to save the Canadian identity already has
been lost. "Canada will become a northern Puerto Rico," he predicted.</TE>
<TE>   Even those booksellers who aren't quite so pessimistic say they
feel betrayed whenever they see a Canadian postal service delivery
truck. The sides of the trucks display advertising for Amazon.</TE>
<TE>   "The government has made these rules and laws that you have to buy
Canadian, but on the other hand a government company is putting out
that Americans are great," Holmes fumed. "It's incredible."</TE>
<TE>   As for Amazon, the company is serene, confident of ultimate
victory. Time is on its side, Amazon.ca General Manager Marven Krug
said in a September interview with news agency Canadian Press.</TE>
<TE>   The more time the matter spends in court, Krug said, the more
customers Amazon will have a chance to acquire.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it would be completely absurd at that point to try and
shut us down," he said.</TE>

<HD>Radical Surgery Is Needed on the Way America Finances
Health Care</HD>

<LD>Never mind the operating room. The most critical procedures at
hospitals these day are taking place in the billing department.</LD>
<LD>   The scandal of the moment in medical care -- in which Tenet
Healthcare Corp. is being audited by federal officials who are
concerned that the hospital company may be overbilling Medicare for
certain services -- is symptomatic of widespread problems in the way
America finances medicine today.</LD>
<LD>   The issue is one of incredible complexity and confusion in the way
hospitals and doctors are reimbursed by Medicare and private
insurance companies alike. One expert calls it a "discontinuity
between rising costs of providing medical care and continued
discounting of reimbursement."</LD>
<TE>   The difficulty stems from a failure so far to cope with an
inescapable fact: As the American population ages, more people will
be sicker longer and therefore will cost more to treat.</TE>
<TE>   So-called outlier payments, which have been aggressively pursued
by Santa Barbara-based Tenet, are one of the convoluted ways the
system tries to compensate for that failure.</TE>
<TE>   Practically every hospital and health-care provider in the country
benefits from such payments. They are part of the way the system
muddles along, patching an extra reimbursement here to cover an
unnecessary shortfall there -- Band-Aid on Band-Aid.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the curious term, outliers are not patients lying on cots
outside a hospital ward. They are patients who require particularly
long hospital stays because they have complications after surgery or
simply because their age and level of illness make extraordinary
treatment inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   If, say, an elderly patient comes in with a respiratory problem
and has to go on a ventilator, that could mean a 20-day stay in the
hospital. Yet that would be longer than is specified for respiratory
treatments in the contracts typically negotiated between hospitals
and those on the other side of the table: private insurers and, in
some cases, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.</TE>
<TE>   The days the patient stays beyond contract terms are called the
"outlier" period. But rather than leave the hospital eating the loss,
the facility is actually reimbursed at a higher rate per day than the
contract would otherwise allow.</TE>
<TE>   Why higher? Because these outlier payments are closer to a
hospital's own list of prices for care, which are adjusted for
inflation. The contracts with insurers and Medicare fail to fully
recognize inflation as a factor.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital payroll costs, for example, rose 8.6% in 2001 -- more
than double the increase of the previous year -- because there are
severe shortages of skilled hospital personnel. For example, there is
a dearth of nurses in California, a situation that could get much
worse if new state regulations go into effect specifying one
registered nurse for every two or three patients in some specialties.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Medicare and insurer contracts make little or no allowance
for such cost escalation. So, outlier payments are used to compensate
and keep hospitals and doctors offices functioning.</TE>
<TE>   "Insurers and Medicare are very understanding in making the
outlier payments because they recognize the problem," says Blair
Contratto, chief executive of Little Company of Mary Hospital in
Torrance. Outlier payments account for almost 10% of revenue for
Contratto's nonprofit facility. (Tenet, for its part, is accused of
boosting outlier payments to 26% of revenue at some of its
hospitals.)</TE>
<TE>   The fact that such a roundabout scheme characterizes the financing
of the nation's largest single industry -- with $1.5 trillion spent
last year on doctors, hospitals, drugs and other treatments, 14% of
the gross domestic product -- signals what a mess we're in.</TE>
<TE>   Is there a better way to handle all this?</TE>
<TE>   The answer is a resounding yes -- but it would require the
recognition that quality medical care is expensive and growing more
so. As a first step, the financing system could become far more
straightforward with relatively little effort.</TE>
<TE>   "Contracts could include a 3.5% escalator clause to bring them
closer to reality," says Susan Medel, chief financial officer of TMGI
Cos., a Pasadena firm that manages community hospitals in Chino and
the east San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   But longer term, truly tough choices must be made.</TE>
<TE>   We need to own up to the fact that hospitals are treating more
elderly and sick patients than ever before, thanks to changing
demographics and technology that keeps the infirm hanging on. And
somebody is going to have to pay for that.</TE>
<TE>   In turn, there will be increasing strains on a system in which 41
million Americans already are uninsured. "Are we really saying that
reductions" in medical care should be "experienced mainly by the
poor?" asks Uwe Reinhardt, a Princeton University health-care
scholar. "I would not want to make that call -- other than to plead
that we be honest about it."</TE>
<TE>   One company that is trying to approach things in a more upfront
way is PacifiCare Health Systems  Inc., which covers 3.2 million
people. The Cypress-based company operates the Secure Horizons HMO to
provide total medical care, including pharmaceuticals, for Medicare
recipients.</TE>
<TE>   But Medicare's reimbursements no longer are keeping up with rising
costs. The federal health program for the elderly used to cover 95%
of the medical expenses incurred by PacifiCare. Then in 1997,
Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act and forced Medicare to cut
back its reimbursement rates.</TE>
<TE>   So now PacifiCare has come up with another solution: It's asking
its Medicare patients to foot more of the bill.</TE>
<TE>   "About half our Secure Horizons members will be asked to pay
higher monthly premiums to offset health-care inflation and
insufficient federal funding," says a PacifiCare spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, every health-care consumer is going to be called on to
do the same thing. It's not an easy pill to swallow, but financial
shell games like outlier payments can mask reality for only so long.</TE>

<LD>In response to Chris Knopp's ideas about longshoring ("Seeking Level
Field for Labor Talks," Letters, Oct. 27):</LD>
<LD>   The Pacific Maritime Assn. passed out applications to the general
public in 1997. It's not a "private club." I'm a part-time casual
longshoreman. If I want to make my money I have to be available 24
hours, seven days a week.</LD>
<LD>   When I go to the dispatch hall there's no guarantee I'll work at
all. Sometimes I get up at 4 a.m. and don't get a morning job. Or I
pick up a job at 6 p.m. and don't make it back home until 4 a.m.</LD>
<TE>   Some days I literally spend eight hours seeking, waiting and
driving to and from work with no pay at all. Does this sound
"spoiled" to you?</TE>

<TE>   The "lock the International Longshore and Warehouse Union has on
the ports" has ensured our great working conditions. If not for this
"lock" we would surely be exploited like every other worker in this
industry around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Why shouldn't a person enjoy a piece of the pie (1.8% of a
$300-billion-plus industry) and the dignity that goes with making
good wages? They couldn't have grown this big without us.</TE>

<TE>   Now, in the name of "balanced coverage" let's have a report on the
salaries of the executives in the PMA.</TE>

salaries, but I bet they'll be real shy about their own.</TE>

<HD>Ruling in Microsoft Case Says Crime Pays</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Half a dozen business fools have opined that the Microsoft ruling
("Microsoft Wins Major Points in Antitrust Settlement Ruling," Nov.
2) is good, or moot, as the network is now the important area of
competition.</LD>
<LD>   They neglect the unintended consequence of teaching a very large
number of software wizards that crime does pay. They forget that
Microsoft was caught and convicted of playing monopoly with their
operating system and escaped punishment in a very public way.</LD>
<LD>   A successful Enron, that is what businessmen admire. The law was
broken, ethical behavior abandoned, but all that matters is the
blessed bottom line. They won.</LD>
<TE>   It is possible that the Europeans will have something to say that
is more pointed than our lapdog Justice Department. I can only hope.</TE>

<TE>   When a monopoly abuses its power to destroy competition, it may
still continue to improve its products, but without viable
competition we will never know what browsers could be doing now had
healthy competition been allowed.</TE>
<TE>   People may shrug the ruling off merely because we are used to our
government favoring the interests of big corporations over individual
consumers. Just because we expected it, doesn't mean we like it.</TE>

<LD>I have another take on "Little Gain Seen in Patent Filings," Oct. 21.</LD>
<LD>   Patents are supposed to reward innovation. But the system rewards
patent holders that have the broadest patents and the deepest pockets
to protect them.</LD>
<LD>   The situation is so bad that companies are patenting the most
obvious, simple ideas, such as motorizing something or adding a
computer control. Where's the innovation in this?</LD>

<LD>The rents quoted in "Rents in Southland Rising at Brisk Pace," (Oct.

Almost all of these properties rank in the top 5% of rents.</LD>
<LD>   The rents quoted may be accurate for large luxury apartments, but
they far overstate average rents in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Also, the rents stated are not average rents but the rents for
vacancies in these luxury apartments.</LD>

<HD>Two Lead Change at Ports During Critical Juncture</HD>
<DH>One frontman unites employers to push for new technology</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael A. Hiltzik</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He's a former corporate human resources specialist who peppers his
speech with mild expressions like "gosh" and "holy mackerel," a man
who had no maritime experience when he took over the West Coast port
employers group six years ago.</LD>
<LD>   But as president of the Pacific Maritime Assn., Joseph N. Miniace
has emerged as a bare-knuckled negotiator unafraid to back up his
words with action -- just as he did Sept. 27 when he locked 10,500
dockworkers out of terminals from San Diego to Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   The lockout -- the first since the PMA was founded in 1948 --
produced the longest work stoppage on West Coast docks since a
five-month strike in 1971. It provoked a rare federal back-to-work
order under the Taft-Hartley Act, which eventually led to an accord
Nov. 1 over the most contentious issue between longshoremen and
management: how to roll out labor-saving technology to make the ports
more efficient without cutting too deeply into union jurisdiction.
The two sides remain far apart, however, on a pension package.</LD>
<TE>   In the weeks leading up to and during the lockout, Miniace made it
clear that his goal was to extract concessions on technology to boost
productivity. The International Longshore and Warehouse Union has
resisted such change for years, he contended, but the future
competitiveness of the ports depends on it.</TE>
<TE>   ILWU officials regarded Miniace as the frontman for an
ill-concealed attempt to break the union.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Miniace has achieved his goal by instituting the lockout
and holding negotiations under government pressure may not be known
until a final contract with the ILWU is reached -- or even before the
next round of negotiations gets underway less than three years from
now.</TE>
<TE>   What is indisputable is that Miniace's 1996 appointment as PMA
president presaged a dramatic change in the dynamics of labor
relations on the docks. Union officials say the employers
organization has become progressively more confrontational, a change
that culminated with the lockout.</TE>
<TE>   That the habitually complaisant employers' organization would take
such a dramatic and costly step shocked port observers. "Not a lot of
people believed Mr. Miniace when he said he would lock out" the
workers, said Susan Kohn Ross, a Los Angeles attorney specializing in
port issues.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Plans for Lockout</TE>
<TE>   In truth, Miniace had been preparing his membership for the
lockout for years. He personally jawboned the top executives of the
steamship lines and stevedoring companies that make up the PMA,
traveling to corporate headquarters around the world from his San
Francisco office, urging the member companies to prepare to take
short-term financial losses in return for lasting change on the
docks.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked about it at length," the 56-year-old Miniace said in a
recent interview, referring to the discussions he held upon taking
office with top executives at the PMA's most important member firms.
"The economic hammer that the ILWU had held over the industry during
negotiations has been significant over the last few years."</TE>
<TE>   The more than 70 shipping lines and terminal operators that make
up the PMA, he added, "understand that if they are going to deal with
power, they have to have their own power."</TE>
<TE>   Central to achieving that end has been Miniace's effort during the
last six years to refashion the PMA, long an unwieldy coalition, into
a professional organization capable of keeping a united front in
talks with the monolithic union.</TE>
<TE>   Lending urgency to his task is the conviction among many
association members that it had come out on the short side of the
last two contract negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   "In '96 and '99 we rolled on every ... thing [the union] wanted
and got nothing in return," said G. Scott Jones, chairman of General
Steamship Corp. and a former PMA board member. "The question was,
would we have the guts to stand together this time and get things
done?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shutdowns Avoided</TE>
<TE>   Even before 1996, PMA sources say, some board members were
concerned about what they saw as the PMA's habit of appeasing the
union in quest of labor peace.</TE>
<TE>   The organization had long been dominated by steamship companies
for which labor costs were a relatively small part of total expenses,
and whose main concern was to avoid shutdowns at any price so that
ships and goods could keep moving. Their relative complaisance over
labor issues put them at odds with more-militant employers, including
terminal operators such as Stevedoring Services of America, whose
loading and unloading responsibilities are labor-intensive and thus
are more sensitive to wage and union-jurisdiction issues.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing the steamship lines detest is downtime in the harbor,"
said Daniel J. Olson, a labor-relations specialist at the University
of Washington. In previous negotiations, the PMA's solid front often
had crumbled under pressure from the steamship lines to keep the
ports operating.</TE>
<TE>   By the mid-1990s, when the PMA began its search for a successor to
President William Coday, the association board "was of the opinion
that the industry was going to be challenged, and we needed to take a
different approach toward labor negotiations," said C. Bradley
Mulholland, vice chairman of Matson Transportation Co., who served on
the search committee.</TE>
<TE>   The steamship business was undergoing a rapid transformation. U.S.
companies were being swallowed by foreign-based multinational
shipowners. Port volumes were increasing, but a growing share of
imports landing at U.S. docks belonged to mega-retailers such as
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp., which were using their size
and financial heft to exact lower shipping rates.</TE>
<TE>   For the shipping companies, the answer to this margin squeeze was
the introduction of new technology, including electronic scanners
feeding computer databases, which would simplify the tracking of
containers through the ports. They were determined to cut out rules
requiring union clerks to reenter by hand data that arrived
electronically at dockside, which they saw as featherbedding.</TE>
<TE>   "The union had done well to keep technology out," Jones said. "We
knew we had to break that" and improve logistical efficiency on the
docks.</TE>
<TE>   Union observers say the ILWU was not trying to exclude new
technology per se, but to ensure that the operators of the new
systems remained unionized employees.</TE>
<TE>   "This impasse has everything to do with the classic question of
who controls production at the point of production," Olson said.
"Employers want to have unconstrained control, and the unions say
this is part of the work of the waterfront and therefore union work."</TE>
<TE>   The PMA search committee believed that the key to victory in this
battle would be to find a president who could unite the PMA's
fragmented membership behind him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Skilled Navigator</TE>
<TE>   Miniace seemed to have the right resume. After human-resources and
labor-relations jobs at Ford Motor Co. and Ryder Trucks, he had been
vice president for human resources at New York University Medical
Center from 1991 to 1996. The health-care institution was not only
going through wrenching changes -- this was the onset of the
managed-care revolution -- but also had a management that answered to
numerous and often contentious interest groups.</TE>
<TE>   Colleagues say Miniace was a skilled navigator among the various
blocs.</TE>
<TE>   "His personality was a big help," said Theresa Bischoff, president
of NYU Hospitals Center, who was Miniace's immediate superior. "He
was a walk-around leader, meeting many people, ranging from building
services to the surgeons in the OR. They really felt he was
interested in learning about them."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the PMA recruiters considered his ability to
communicate with varied masters more important than his lack of
experience at the ports.</TE>
<TE>   "He had no experience in the maritime field whatsoever -- and it
wasn't needed," Jones said. Miniace's strength instead was his
predilection for straight talk. "He would say things very decidedly
and not coat the lily."</TE>
<TE>   With his wife, Giana, Miniace moved to the Bay Area in time to
observe the PMA's 1996 round of labor negotiations, which were
handled by the soon-to-retire Coday. He declines to say what he
learned from the experience, but PMA sources say he was appalled at
the informality of the negotiations and the vagueness of the
resulting contract.</TE>
<TE>   Upon assuming the presidency a few months later, Miniace
immediately began restructuring the organization from the top down.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who hired me wanted change," he said. "They wanted the
PMA managed as a business. They wanted to change how it managed its
labor relations in order to move the industry into the future."</TE>
<TE>   Miniace's strategy was to bring top executives of the member
companies onto the board -- major decision-makers rather than the
local sales and operating executives who traditionally had served as
directors. "The financial issues presented by our labor relations
needed to be dealt with at the highest levels," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He spent countless hours mustering support for a unified stance
among the employers, unwaveringly delivering the message that they
might have to suffer through a short-term shutdown in order to reap
long-term gains.</TE>
<TE>   "Joe didn't wait for the owners to come to him," Mulholland said.
"He went to the owners and met with them to build a trusting
relationship, so that if he ever got in a situation like he's in
today they would hold tough, not come apart like they had in the
past."</TE>
<TE>   There was a parallel change, union officials say, in the PMA's
labor relations, which were suddenly infused with a new truculence.</TE>
<TE>   Miniace "came in as very confrontational," said Steve Stallone, a
spokesman for the ILWU. "The idea was he'd be the tough guy on the
block. He made public statements constantly bashing the union and
he'd bypass arbitrations and try to take us to court. It was a new
approach."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Growing Hostility</TE>
<TE>   Union leaders say the new atmosphere was exemplified by a 1997
dispute over a ship called the Neptune Jade. The container ship was
carrying "hot cargo," having been loaded in Britain by a company that
had fired union dockworkers during a 1995 labor dispute in Liverpool.</TE>
<TE>   When the Neptune Jade steamed into Oakland in October 1997, groups
of labor activists threw up a picket line that the ILWU refused to
cross. After three days the ship pulled out without being unloaded.</TE>
<TE>   Because the ILWU contract indemnified it from damage claims
stemming from such actions, the PMA instead filed suit against
individual pickets.</TE>
<TE>   In pretrial depositions, the association tried to force an ILWU
protester to identify other pickets, evidently with the goal of
adding them to the defendants' roster.</TE>
<TE>   The PMA also sued to force the ILWU newspaper, the Dispatcher, to
give up files identifying the planners of the work stoppage.</TE>
<TE>   The employers lost on both fronts. An Oakland judge ruled that the
Dispatcher's files were protected under California's press shield
laws, and the threat of a walkout soon forced the PMA to drop the
rest of its lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   But the damage was done.</TE>
<TE>   "The litigation was viewed by workers as a hostile act," Olson
said. "There was no gain for the PMA, and a lot of ill will that
doesn't just evaporate."</TE>
<TE>   Union officials say Miniace brought his confrontational approach
into the 1999 contract negotiations, but failed to make it stick. "He
didn't have the backing" from the PMA membership, Stallone asserted.</TE>
<TE>   Union and management sources say he prepared much more carefully
for the 2002 contract round. In speech after speech he kept up a
drumbeat of warnings that the industry must stand firm during
contract negotiations if it were finally to achieve the productivity
gains it had been seeking since the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the PMA has heeded Miniace's call.</TE>
<TE>   "This group is absolutely, solidly unified," Miniace said. "I've
never seen such unity in my life."</TE>

<HD>Cut in Interest Rates Not a Signal to Increase Debt</HD>
<DH>Consumers are advised to resist the temptation to spend and
take advantage of the decline to get their financial houses in order.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathy M. Kristof</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anne Viricel of Alta Loma appreciates the Federal Reserve's tenacious
effort to get Americans spending again by cutting the cost of debt --
but she's resisting the lure of patriotic consumption.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Reserve has cut its key lending rate a dozen times
since January 2001, including a surprisingly steep
half-percentage-point cut last week.</LD>
<LD>   Those moves, which have pushed banks to cut the cost of both
short-term credit and home mortgages, have saved Viricel a tidy $500
a month in interest payments.</LD>
<TE>   But she's not spending.</TE>
<TE>   Neither is Levon Jackson, a 21-year-old college student from Los
Angeles who once was such a prodigious shopper that she racked up
$6,500 in credit card bills before she even had a job.</TE>
<TE>   Both Jackson and Viricel have been burned before by debt. Now,
they're using this period of historically low interest rates to get
their financial houses in order.</TE>
<TE>   That's the savviest way to handle today's low-interest
environment, said Dianne Wilkman, president of Springboard, a credit
counseling and debt management firm in San Bernardino.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an opportune time to restructure your finances to put
yourself in a better position," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Credit counselors say it's a shame that there aren't more people
doing the same.</TE>
<TE>   Retailers and economic policymakers are doing everything they can
to keep Americans in the malls in an effort to jump-start the
nation's sluggish economy, because consumer spending accounts for
two-thirds of U.S. economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   The downside to this shop-for-your-country campaign is that
Americans are increasingly indebted. The Federal Reserve reported
Thursday that U.S. consumer debt jumped by $9.9 billion in September,
up from a revised $5.6-billion gain in August.</TE>
<TE>   The jump in debt is linked to simple math: Borrowing is cheap at
today's historically low interest rates. The prime rate -- the rate
that banks charge their best customers -- hasn't been this low since
1959.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What Goes Down . . .</TE>
<TE>   But consumers who are lured into spending lavishly because they
think they can handle additional debt at today's low rates could find
themselves in a world of hurt when rates start heading back up,
credit counselors say.</TE>
<TE>   "People have started to develop an attitude that if the interest
rate is low, it's a good deal and they can afford it, without taking
an independent view of whether they can afford the underlying item
that they're looking to buy," said Tiff Worley, president of Auriton
Solutions, a credit counseling company in St. Paul, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   "If rates go up, or something changes in their lives, consumers
risk being unable to make the payments," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The interest rates on many debts are fixed and don't pose the
threat of becoming unaffordable if rates start to rise. But some
types of loans -- home equity lines of credit and many credit cards,
for example -- have variable rates that will rise with the prime
rate.</TE>
<TE>   Interest rate increases aren't a disaster for those who borrow
modestly. But many consumers are woefully over their heads, and the
Fed's latest rate cut may push more individuals over the edge, debt
counselors say.</TE>
<TE>   "Is this new rate going to help stimulate people to buy and spend
before the holidays? I think it is," said Chris Viale, general
manager of Cambridge Credit Counseling Corp. in Agawam, Mass. "That
may be good for the economy, but it's not good for consumers at all.
We will see more spending and a much higher delinquency rate."</TE>
<TE>   Bankruptcies and foreclosures are at historic levels and consumer
debt levels are near all-time highs. That underscores the fact that
some consumers should not be assuming more debt, despite the
declining cost of credit, counselors said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Restructure Debt</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they should do what Viricel and Jackson have done -- take
advantage of the low rates by paying off high-cost debt with
lower-cost credit. Then use the money saved to pay down credit
balances and save for emergencies and future goals.</TE>
<TE>   Viricel, for example, refinanced the mortgage on her residence
three months ago. That move saved her nearly $500 a month in interest
costs. But instead of spending that money, Viricel is using it to pay
off her mortgage.</TE>
<TE>   At her current pace, the 44-year-old business manager will have
the house paid off within three years. At that point, she says, she
can decide whether to continue working or simply retire early.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to buy things when I got extra money," said Viricel. "Now
I put the money toward paying off my house or adding to savings."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson doesn't have a home, so she has pulled herself out of the
malls. She's paying off her credit cards, completing her education
and trying to save to buy a home.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great idea to pay off high-cost debt with low-cost debt,"
Wilkman said.</TE>
<TE>   For homeowners, the ideal way to restructure debt is with a
mortgage refinancing or a home equity line of credit, experts say.
Home mortgage rates, which were in the 8% range two years ago, now
can be had for a little more than 6%, said Steven Foster, president
of Vista Financial, a North Hollywood-based mortgage brokerage.</TE>
<TE>   Those with sufficient equity in their homes can boost the amount
of their mortgage to take enough cash out of the deal to pay off
personal and car loans and credit cards, he said. That can cut
required monthly payments and lock in a tax-deductible fixed interest
rate.</TE>
<TE>   Those who haven't built up at least 25% equity in their homes may
be better served by a home equity line of credit, Foster said.</TE>
<TE>   Home equity credit lines often cost little or nothing to set up
and can be used to tap more home equity.</TE>
<TE>   The interest rate on a home equity line of credit usually is
variable and tied directly to the prime rate. Good credit risks with
lots of home equity can get a loan at the prime rate -- that's 4.25%
today -- while those with less equity or less pristine credit could
pay as much as prime plus 4 percentage points, Foster said.</TE>
<TE>   Home equity loans of as much as $100,000 also are tax-deductible,
making them exceptionally inexpensive at today's rates. But beware,
Foster said. The prime rate can rise as rapidly as it falls. If
interest rates rise rapidly, the cost of a home equity line can soar.</TE>
<TE>   "If you know it's going to be several years before you can pay off
the debt, move as much of it as you can to a fixed-rate loan so you
have more interest rate stability," Foster suggested.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Paying vs. Spending</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, those who don't own homes have far fewer options,
Wilkman said.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers may be able to refinance a late-model car at a lower
rate, but credit card rates are no bargain. For these consumers, the
best answer is Jackson's: Stop spending and start paying off the
bills.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to resist the siren call of low-rate financing," said
Keith Gumbinger, a financial analyst with the rate-tracking firm HSH
Associates in Butler, N.J. "But if you're not careful, cheap
financing can put you in a very uncomfortable circumstance down the
road."</TE>

<HD>Fed's Message: Take on Risk or Earn No Return</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tom Petruno</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Holding money in a cash account isn't supposed to be a ticket to
great wealth. But in the lifetimes of most Americans, cash has never
been as seemingly wretched an option as now.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Reserve's surprise decision last week to slash its key
short-term interest rate by a half-point, to a 41-year low of 1.25%,
will drive interest returns on the trillions of dollars in money
market funds, bank CDs, short-term Treasury bills and other so-called
cash accounts to new generational lows as well.</LD>
<LD>   Only the Fed knows what signal or signals it wanted to send with
the rate cut, the central bank's first reduction in 11 months. But
for savers and investors, one message is loud and clear: Your only
chance of earning higher returns is to take more risk with your money
-- say, in stocks or bonds.</LD>
<TE>   That's how markets are supposed to work, of course. Investors
shouldn't expect to be richly rewarded for being chickens.</TE>
<TE>   But older Americans, in particular, can be forgiven for viewing
the Fed's latest move as something akin to a forced-march order. If
they stay in cash, they're guaranteed to earn practically zero on
their savings. If they leave for higher-risk securities, they at
least have a shot at earning decent returns.</TE>
<TE>   Many times in the late 1990s the Fed was accused of pandering to
Wall Street. For example, the three quick rate cuts in the fall of
1998, after the near-failure of the giant hedge fund Long Term
Capital Management rocked world markets, were later seen as a direct
attempt to shore up stocks -- even though, on Main Street, there was
no sense of imminent financial calamity.</TE>
<TE>   For its efforts in the late 1990s, the Fed has since been accused
of helping to inflate the stock market bubble by keeping money too
easy for too long. The central bank's supporters say that fails to
acknowledge the political realities of the era (i.e., the Fed would
have been excoriated if it quashed the economic boom of that period).</TE>
<TE>   Still, last week's rate cut was roundly viewed as aimed at least
in part at bolstering stock prices, which had been rallying for four
straight weeks, boosting hopes that the 31-month-old bear market was
finally over.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed knew that Wall Street was expecting a quarter-point drop
in rates, and Fed officials had said nothing leading up to
Wednesday's meeting to suggest that they would order a bigger
reduction.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, the half-point cut was meant to be a pleasant surprise. If
the stock market can continue to rebound, after all, it could help
pull up consumer confidence, which fell in October to a nine-year
low. If consumers are more confident, they may be less fearful about
spending. If spending picks up, so should the economy.</TE>
<TE>   One argument that the rate cut was more for the stock market's
psychological benefit than a move meant to directly spur more
borrowing is that consumer loan rates already are either at rock
bottom or are unlikely to be affected by a new Fed reduction. Car
loans at zero-percent are an example of the former; credit card rates
are an example of the latter.</TE>
<TE>   Yet so far, the Fed's move hasn't been warmly received by equity
investors.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks rallied modestly Wednesday, with the Dow Jones industrials
gaining 92.74 points for the day. But the blue-chip index slumped
184.77 points on Thursday and 49.11 points on Friday, to end at
8,537.13.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow eked out a net gain of 0.2% for the week, extending its
winning streak to five weeks. But the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.1%
for the week and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 0.7%.</TE>
<TE>   More striking is that the market's inability to extend Wednesday's
rally was atypical of what usually happens when the Fed gives
investors a nice surprise. Investment firm Bridgewater Associates in
Wilton, Conn., calculated that, for the magnitude of Wednesday's
surprise, "The current market reaction is as weak as we've ever
seen."</TE>
<TE>   Are investors afraid that the Fed's cut indicates policymakers
fear the economy could tip back into recession? The Fed, in its
statement Wednesday, said the economy had hit a "soft spot" --
implying a temporary problem.</TE>
<TE>   But the action in the Treasury bond market last week, as in the
stock market, wasn't a rousing vote of confidence in the recovery.
Long-term Treasury bond yields fell sharply, with the yield on the
10-year T-note sliding to 3.84% by Friday from 4.07% on Tuesday. The
yield is not far above its record low of 3.57% set on Oct. 9.</TE>
<TE>   The rush back into longer-term Treasuries was partly attributed to
some investors' belief that the Fed is finished cutting short-term
rates. If that's true -- and if investors expect the Fed to hold at
these levels for an extended period -- a natural response would be to
shift money from cash accounts into longer-term bonds, to lock in
yields.</TE>
<TE>   Why might the Fed want money to flow into longer-term bonds? That
could push mortgage rates lower, providing more support for the
housing market, which has been one of the few pillars of strength
supporting the economy this year.</TE>
<TE>   Whether many more investors will decide they can no longer take
the pain of holding cash in short-term accounts remains to be seen.
For some, near-zero returns on cash still make more sense than taking
the risk of deep losses on stocks or real estate (if the economy
crumbles) or bonds (if the economy zooms, driving long-term rates
up).</TE>
<TE>   And as low as savings yields have gotten, they arguably aren't as
bad as in some previous eras, when adjusted for inflation.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index,
rose at a rate of 7.4% a year, according to data tracker Ibbotson
Associates in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   In the same decade, the average annual return on three-month
Treasury bills was 6.3%.</TE>
<TE>   So adjusted for inflation, the return on T-bills in that decade
was a negative 1.1% a year.</TE>
<TE>   The current yield on three-month T-bills is 1.21%. CPI inflation
over the last 12 months has risen 1.5%. If inflation stays at that
rate, the annual after-inflation return on T-bills is approximately
negative 0.3%. That's lousy, but it could be a lot worse.</TE>

<LD>SEC Chief Pitt Submits Resignation</LD>
<LD>   Harvey L. Pitt, the beleaguered chairman of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, resigned under pressure after his latest misstep
left the White House embarrassed and unwilling to fight for his
future as Wall Street's chief regulator.</LD>
<LD>   Fifteen months after his appointment, Pitt submitted a
four-paragraph resignation letter to President Bush in which he said
the controversy surrounding him was blunting the SEC's efforts to
restore investors' faith in financial markets.</LD>
<TE>   His resignation ends a term marked by repeated gaffes and
controversies in a year when public trust in markets has been shaken
by a steep slide in stock prices, widespread allegations of Wall
Street misconduct and massive accounting scandals.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt sparked a firestorm after it was revealed that he did not
share with the four other SEC commissioners potentially damaging
information about William H. Webster, whom Pitt had championed to be
chairman of a new accounting industry oversight board.</TE>
<TE>   The White House also may have a second vacancy to worry about:
Webster may be pressured to quit over revelations stemming from his
service as chairman of the audit committee of U.S. Technologies,
which was sued by shareholders for fraud.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Regulators to Audit Tenet Hospitals</TE>
<TE>   Tenet Healthcare Corp. disclosed that U.S. regulators are
preparing to audit its hospitals to determine whether the Santa
Barbara-based company properly billed Medicare for certain services.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services said the
audit, made known to Tenet on Oct. 28, was prompted by concerns
raised by a contractor that processes Medicare claims for the
government.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet was criticized by investors after it waited a day to
disclose a federal raid two weeks ago at its hospital in Redding.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet, the nation's second-largest publicly traded hospital
company, with 113 facilities, has been reeling amid Wall Street
questions about certain Medicare payments and the investigation of
alleged medical fraud involving two doctors at the Redding facility
who may have been performing unnecessary heart operations.</TE>
<TE>   Two of Tenet's top executives left the hospital company as Chief
Executive Jeffrey Barbakow questioned pricing policies that have
sparked the government audit. Chief Financial Officer David Dennis,
53, resigned, and Chief Operating Officer Thomas Mackey, 54, retired.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fed Cuts Key Rate by a Half-Point</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate a surprising
half-point to just 1.25% and acknowledged that it worries that the
nation's economic recovery is faltering.</TE>
<TE>   The central bank's policymaking Federal Open Market Committee
acted after two months of rising unemployment, falling consumer
confidence and a new nose dive by American manufacturers suggested
that the economy has been unable to sustain the growth spurt it put
on earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   The 12-member panel voted unanimously to cut the signal-sending
federal funds rate to its lowest level since July 1961.</TE>
<TE>   Policymakers suggested that the new rate cut was all that was
needed to coax the country back to economic health and that no
further reductions were planned.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq Winning Streaks Broken</TE>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index lost 0.7% last week and the Nasdaq
composite fell 0.1% -- snapping four-week winning streaks for both of
the widely watched market barometers. The Dow Jones industrials,
meanwhile, eked out a 0.2% gain, extending that winning streak to
five weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The mixed results came as the United Nations moved closer to a
confrontation with Iraq, voters gave Republicans control of the
Senate, the Federal Reserve unleashed a surprisingly steep half-point
cut in interest rates, Harvey L. Pitt submitted his resignation as
head of the Securities and Exchange Commission and bellwether
companies such as Cisco Systems Inc. and McDonald's Corp. issued
downbeat status reports on their businesses. The economic numbers,
meanwhile, provided little concrete guidance for investors.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Syncor May Have Violated Bribery Laws</TE>
<TE>   Nuclear medicine provider Syncor International Corp. said it may
have broken U.S. bribery laws by making payments to health-care
facilities in Taiwan and China -- a disclosure that hammered the
stock price of the Woodland Hills company and put on hold its pending
acquisition by Cardinal Health Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Syncor Chairman Monty Fu and his brother, Moses Fu, who directs
the company's Asian operations, are on leave "pending completion of
an investigation into their involvement in the payments," the company
said.</TE>
<TE>   Monty Fu also stepped aside as a director, while a special
committee of Syncor's outside board members looks into possible
violations of the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars U.S.
companies from bribing foreign officials.</TE>
<TE>   The company wouldn't provide details about the payments that are
under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the more pressing question is whether Dublin,
Ohio-based drug wholesaling giant Cardinal, which discovered the
irregularities during the pre-merger due-diligence process, will call
off its deal to buy the much smaller Syncor for more than $900
million in stock and assumption of $200 million in debt.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NBC to Purchase Bravo Cable Channel</TE>
<TE>   NBC agreed to buy the Bravo cable channel from Cablevision Systems
Corp. for $1.25 billion in cash and stock.</TE>
<TE>   The transaction would give NBC, which is owned by General Electric
Co., its first general entertainment cable channel. NBC Chief
Executive Bob Wright said his network will focus on developing new
shows, rather than using it to air repeats, as some of its broadcast
rivals do with their in-house cable channels.</TE>
<TE>   NBC's rival broadcasters already own such cable channels, allowing
them to spread the high costs of prime-time TV production across
several outlets.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Wright said he does see opportunities for Bravo to share
the collective resources of NBC to strengthen the channel -- and
therefore its ratings and advertising revenue.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Bravo could use footage from NBC News, CNBC and
MSNBC to develop new programs as well as for its nonfiction signature
shows, "Bravo Profile" and "Inside the Actor's Studio."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Regulators to Seek Ways to Share Airwaves</TE>
<TE>   Federal regulators launched a sweeping examination of the
government's management of the nation's valuable airwaves, a move
that could pave the way for cheaper and more innovative wireless
devices.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Federal Communications Commission considered a
highly anticipated report on spectrum management that recommends a
more flexible approach to sharing the airwaves, including an overhaul
of the standards for governing airwave interference and provisions to
allow owners of airwave licenses to resell them under certain
circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the agency authorized the opening up of more airwaves
for advanced wireless services.</TE>

<TE>   Vivendi Faces SEC, U.S. Attorney Probes</TE>
<TE>   Already under scrutiny by authorities in Paris over whether it
concealed a financial crisis, Vivendi Universal is also the target of
a criminal investigation by the U.S. attorney's office in New York
and a probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The investigations are further complicating efforts to restore
confidence in the French media giant and are expected to parallel
similar inquiries already underway in France, sources familiar with
the probes said.</TE>
<TE>   French prosecutors last month opened an investigation of whether
the company published "false accounts" for 2000 and 2001 to hide its
cash crunch from investors.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi described the investigation by the U.S. attorney's office
in the Southern District of New York as preliminary and said the
SEC's Miami office would be coordinating its own investigation with
federal prosecutors.</TE>

<TE>   Disney's Profit Increases 17%</TE>
<TE>   Walt Disney Co. capped one of its most difficult fiscal years with
results that showed profit rose 17% thanks in part to strong DVD and
video sales of "Monsters, Inc."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Chief Executive Michael Eisner predicted 20% to 30%
profit growth next year from the company's current lethargic levels,
despite continuing problems with the ABC network and soft theme park
results.</TE>
<TE>   The Burbank entertainment giant reported net income of $222
million, or 11 cents a share, compared to a year-earlier profit of
$188 million, or 9 cents, adjusted to reflect revised accounting
rules. Without the adjustment, the net income a year earlier would
have been $53 million, or 3 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue in the three-month period ended Sept. 30 rose 15% to $6.7
billion.</TE>
<TE>   The latest results, which Disney had telegraphed to investors,
were in line with Wall Street's lowered expectations.</TE>
<TE>   The year ended Sept. 30 concludes one of the bleakest years Disney
has endured in a decade, mainly because of a steep falloff in tourism
to its key theme park business and weak ratings at its ABC television
network.</TE>

<HD>Two Lead Change at Ports During Critical Juncture</HD>
<DH>Union leader seeks to protect jobs but heralds innovation</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Weikel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If longshore workers are lords of the docks, James Spinosa is lord of
lords.</LD>
<LD>   As head of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, the
veteran marine clerk leads 10,500 West Coast laborers who load and
unload the raw materials, cars, clothes, computers, toys and other
consumer goods that propel the economies of the Pacific Rim.</LD>
<LD>   He rose to power in the late 1990s, during one of the union's most
rancorous periods. Now he presides over the ILWU at a crucial
juncture in its history -- just as the union's charismatic founder,
Harry Bridges, did 40 years ago when he supported the
containerization of cargo, revolutionizing the maritime industry at
the cost of thousands of waterfront jobs.</LD>
<TE>   Today, shipping lines and terminal operators are demanding
concessions from Spinosa to allow the use of computers and electronic
gear to precisely track containers from ship to customer, which would
eliminate hundreds of union jobs.</TE>
<TE>   How such modernization will be implemented on the docks has led to
a costly and protracted contract dispute with the Pacific Maritime
Assn., which represents shipping lines and terminal operators, many
of them giant foreign-owned companies with global reach.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 1, the union and the employer group reached a compromise
on the critical issue of technology, a key break in the stalemate
that has disrupted West Coast cargo operations for more than a month.</TE>
<TE>   Specific terms of the deal were not released, but people familiar
with the compromise say the tentative agreement basically allows the
use of new technology while extending union jurisdiction and
guaranteeing jobs for life to workers who might be displaced.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the negotiations, Spinosa has performed a delicate
balancing act between applying technology on the docks and protecting
union jobs -- in this case those of hundreds of marine clerks, such
as himself, who track cargo through the ports.</TE>
<TE>   "Spinosa has tried to tell the union that taking a Luddite
approach is a loser," said Peter Olney, a former organizing director
for the ILWU who helps run the Institute of Labor and Employment at
the University of California. "He has taken a lot of political hits
for trying to convince the clerks to accept technology. But he will
not sign a contract that is the union's death warrant."</TE>
<TE>   The labor agreement has not been finalized, and more difficult
negotiating might be ahead when both sides return to the bargaining
table Wednesday after a one-week hiatus ordered last Tuesday by the
federal mediator. The ILWU and the companies are still at an impasse
over the issue of worker pensions.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Determined to Win'</TE>
<TE>   Whether the ILWU will prevail in the talks is yet to be seen. But
those who know Spinosa, both inside and outside the union, say he is
well-suited to lead the union through troubled waters.</TE>
<TE>   "Jimmy is tough, persistent and patient," said Van Barbieri, 62,
of Rancho Palos Verdes, a real estate agent who has been friends with
Spinosa since they attended San Pedro High School in the late 1950s.
"He is bound and determined to win. Knowing his nature, he won't back
down from anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Spinosa's attitude might be summed up by a watercolor cartoon that
hangs in his office at ILWU headquarters in San Francisco. Barbieri
gave it to him. The rendering depicts a bird that has taken a frog
into its large beak and is preparing to swallow it head first. The
amphibian's front legs have the bird's neck in a stranglehold.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't ever give up," the caption states.</TE>
<TE>   Even those on the other side of the bargaining table concede that
Spinosa's 40 years as a dockworker and union official make him a
formidable adversary. He might be reserved and inarticulate in
public, they say, but he knows the maritime industry, and he knows
where he wants to go.</TE>
<TE>   Spinosa "is a shrewd, ruthless guy and good at what he does," said
G. Scott Jones, a shipping company executive who served on the board
of the Pacific Maritime Assn. for 32 years. "He is not really a
leader like Harry Bridges was a leader. He is more in the back room,
pulling the controls."</TE>
<TE>   Despite repeated requests by The Times, Spinosa declined to be
interviewed for this article.</TE>
<TE>   Union spokesman Steve Stallone said the president has been
devoting his time -- 12 to 14 hours a day -- to contract negotiations
and a pending court battle over whether the union deliberately staged
work slowdowns after the lockout.</TE>
<TE>   In his unavailability to the news media, Spinosa stands in sharp
contrast to his counterpart in the shipping industry, Joseph N.
Miniace, head of the maritime association.</TE>
<TE>   While Miniace has been willing to talk directly to news reporters
and answer questions, Spinosa has stuck to prepared statements.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Public Relations Battle</TE>
<TE>   Some well-placed members of the ILWU worry that the union has been
losing the public relations battle with the maritime association. One
local at the Port of Los Angeles recently hired a public-relations
representative, and the AFL-CIO briefly lent the ILWU a spokeswoman
to help with the media.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not been effective getting our message out," said one
ILWU official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Spinosa, a plainly dressed man with a neatly trimmed mustache and
thick eye glasses, leads a diverse union with about 60,000 members in
Alaska, California, Oregon, Washington, Hawaii and Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Its contracts cover a variety of trades including shipping,
warehousing, health care, agriculture, hotel services and auto
mechanics, as well as tug and ferry crews.</TE>
<TE>   At the West Coast ports, the union represents stevedores who
handle freight, marine clerks who track shipments in port, and dock
bosses who supervise cargo operations.</TE>
<TE>   The 61-year-old Spinosa, who was born in New York City and grew up
in San Pedro, became an ILWU member in 1971. In the last 20 years, he
steadily worked his way up the union's political hierarchy and built
a base of support that would eventually propel him to the presidency
of the union.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1980s, he helped organize nonunion workers and created
a West Coast program to monitor freight stations, where cargo
containers are loaded and unloaded. From 1987 to 1991, he served
three terms as president and two terms as vice president of Local 63,
which represents about 1,500 marine clerks in the ports of Los
Angeles and Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Spinosa, whose daughter is a longshore worker and whose son is a
dock boss, served as a coast committeeman from 1991 to 1994. In that
position, he participated in contract negotiations and worked
directly with the union president.</TE>
<TE>   He was elected vice president of the union in 1997 and headed the
negotiating committee for the 1999 contract, which vastly improved
the workers' pension system. He also oversaw the longshore division.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Spinosa became president of the union, defeating Brian
McWilliams, a marine clerk from the Bay Area, who ruled for six rocky
years and fell out of favor with the huge bloc of dockworkers in
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   McWilliams' opponents complained that he was too concerned with
political and social issues to deal with bread-and-butter union
matters, such as improving pay and working conditions.</TE>
<TE>   To some of them, McWilliams' taste for firebrand unionism and
social protest was passe.</TE>
<TE>   They also did not like McWilliams' stance against side deals --
the additional pay offered by terminal operators above the contracted
wage to attract steady dockworkers. He thought the practice, which is
common at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, threatened union
solidarity.</TE>
<TE>   For several years before the election, a powerful faction of
dockworkers from Los Angeles and Long Beach launched several efforts
to remove McWilliams, casting no-confidence votes against him and
urging him to take a leave of absence for the remainder of his term.</TE>
<TE>   "McWilliams was totally hamstrung by Spinosa and the Southern
California locals," Jones said. "The Northwest locals supported
Brian, but the dominance of the south prevailed. Spinosa was a key
man in all this."</TE>
<TE>   Although Spinosa has participated in social protests, union
members say that with his vast experience in contract negotiations,
he appears to be more attuned to dockworker-specific issues than was
his predecessor.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows the rank and file, and he fights for the rank and file,"
said John Tousseau, a veteran marine clerk from San Pedro who is on
the union's negotiating committee. "His strength is his
determination."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Receptive to Technology</TE>
<TE>   In his writing, speeches and testimony before Congress, Spinosa
has said he supports the implementation of new technology on the
docks -- as long as port-related jobs created by the innovations go
to union members. That is consistent with the historic Mechanization
and Modernization Agreement signed by the legendary Bridges in 1960.</TE>
<TE>   The union, he says, has been receptive to technology, especially
containerization, which has done far more to increase productivity of
the maritime industry than anything else. Before goods were organized
efficiently in containers, they were loaded and unloaded on pallets
-- an unwieldy process.</TE>
<TE>   Spinosa contends that the shipping lines now want to use
technological advances to move high-paying port clerical jobs to
low-wage states and to eliminate the ILWU's hiring halls, where the
union controls the assignment of labor to cargo terminals.</TE>
<TE>   The available innovations also threaten hundreds of well-paid
marine clerk positions up and down the West Coast -- although not
crane operator and traditional stevedoring jobs, at least for now.
Clerks earn an average of $118,000 a year, with overtime and shift
premiums. Some terminal operators say they could reduce clerk
positions by at least a third using the latest cargo-tracking
devices.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Critics Balk</TE>
<TE>   But technology, Spinosa counters, is not a "silver bullet" that
will greatly reduce port congestion and solve the lack of space at
West Coast terminals caused by burgeoning international trade.</TE>
<TE>   Vast improvements in moving cargo could be made, he says, if port
terminals operated their gates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and
if businesses agreed to ship and receive goods around the clock as
well.</TE>
<TE>   "Large retail corporations importing thousands of containers
monthly must understand that the practice of warehousing containers
on marine terminals must cease," Spinosa told a congressional
committee investigating the future of the nation's ports in May 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Spinosa's critics say his positions on technology are misleading.
Some dockworkers and terminal operators complain privately that
Spinosa, as a marine clerk, has tried to protect clerks' jobs at the
expense of stevedores, who represent the lion's share of the union's
dockworkers. Four marine clerks are part of the ILWU's inner sanctum,
they say, and they work closely with the president.</TE>
<TE>   "Spinosa does not have a real vision" for the union, Jones said.
"He wants to protect the clerks and keep the golden goose for those
on the inside."</TE>
<TE>   While Spinosa has held top positions within the union, shipping
executives complain, advances in technology have been slow in coming,
putting West Coast ports a decade behind harbors in Asia and Europe.
Technology was removed from the bargaining table in 1996 and 1999,
except for the creation of a joint union-management committee to
study the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Spinosa asserts that shipping lines and terminal operators want
unfettered power to make technological changes, and that preserving
the union's power on the waterfront will remain his top priority.</TE>
<TE>   "We want jobs that remain in the industry," Spinosa has said.
"Jobs that are ours under the contract."</TE>

<DL>ABOARD THE OCEAN BREEZE</DL>
<LD>Over and over again, we had been warned of the many risks we would
face while swimming the English Channel: hypothermia from the cold
water, exhaustion from the high seas and strong currents, shoals of
stinging jellyfish.</LD>
<LD>   But nothing had prepared us for the near miss with a container
ship.</LD>
<LD>   Suddenly, it loomed up to the left, its mammoth hulk bearing down
on our small guide boat, the Ocean Breeze, and Sophie, our youngest
swimmer.</LD>
<TE>   Kicking up a three-foot swell, the blue prow of the Daina was on a
collision course with us, and there was little doubt about the
outcome of a crash between our 38-foot boat and a ship soaring five
stories up to its bridge and piled high with containers.</TE>
<TE>   "What the hell is he doing?" shouted Dave Whyte, pilot of the
Ocean Breeze. The Daina, sailing down the middle of the channel from
north to south, was far outside the two main shipping lanes of one of
the world's busiest waterways.</TE>
<TE>   As a crewman raced to the port side of the Ocean Breeze and
frantically signaled the ship with a hand-held searchlight, the rest
of us shouted starboard, trying to tell Sophie to stop swimming.</TE>
<TE>   Its horns blaring, the Daina swept past, missing us by about 50
feet, throwing out a wake that rocked Sophie and the Ocean Breeze.</TE>
<TE>   Within minutes, our reaction had changed from fear to relief to
laughter. As we listened over our boat's radio, a British Coast Guard
officer rebuked the Daina for being out of the shipping lanes, and
one of the ship's crewmen apologized in broken English.</TE>
<TE>   For this 50-year-old American, who had put together a relay team
to find out what it's like to swim the English Channel, it was the
first of several times that day that I wondered: How, and why, does
anyone do this?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More than 125 years after Matthew Webb, a 27-year-old sailor from
Shropshire, England, officially became the first person to swim
across the channel unassisted, more than 100 people follow his
example each year. They swim as soloists or on relay teams, or sail
aboard unorthodox craft such as gondolas and foot-powered dinghies.</TE>
<TE>   Smeared with porpoise oil and consuming red meat for strength,
coffee for stimulation, and beer and brandy for courage, Webb crossed
the channel in 21 hours, 45 minutes, on Aug. 24, 1875, becoming one
of the world's first international athletic stars. An overnight hero,
he was honored with parades, speeches, cannon salutes, portraits and
poems.</TE>
<TE>   It was 1911 before another Briton, Thomas Burgess, became the
second swimmer to make it, on his 14th try. In 1926, Gertrude Ederle,
a 19-year-old American, was the first woman to swim across. She was
rewarded with a ticker-tape parade back home in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Today, solo swimmers -- who have graduated to personal trainers
and high-energy drinks -- often go much faster than Webb did.
American Chad Hunderby, the current record holder, crossed in 7
hours, 17 minutes in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   But rarely do today's swimmers receive much recognition outside
hometown newspapers or swimming publications and Internet sites.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As the crow flies, the English Channel -- where about 500 ships
travel a day -- is more than 21 miles wide.</TE>
<TE>   But for swimmers, the real distance between England and France is
often much longer, with strong currents and tides pushing them in a
large S-shaped path.</TE>
<TE>   Soloists, who often suffer from numbness and disorientation, are
sometimes swept far off course as they struggle toward France's Cap
Gris-Nez peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   Some give up not far from shore.</TE>
<TE>   The human body loses heat much faster in water than on land, and
at least two people have died of hypothermia while swimming the
waterway.</TE>
<TE>   This season, a relay team was disqualified when one of its
swimmers was pulled out shivering uncontrollably after only half an
hour at sea, 30 minutes short of the minimum required for an
individual stint.</TE>
<TE>   The Channel Swimming Assn., which monitors compliance with its
many rules from guide boats, bars anything as wimpy as a wetsuit.
Why? In honor of Webb's hardiness.</TE>
<TE>   So swimmers often take the only precaution allowed: covering their
bodies with pounds of grease in an effort to stay warm.</TE>
<TE>   Despite that, less than half the soloists succeed in crossing.
Some don't even get a chance during the four-month season, thanks to
bad weather and high seas.</TE>
<TE>   Because people on relay teams usually swim only two or three
60-minute legs, the five on our team didn't use grease, a move I came
to regret.</TE>
<TE>   Three men and two women, ranging in age from 17 to 62, we began
our adventure just before 5 a.m. on a cold September morning, the
first time in days that the channel had been calm enough for
swimmers.</TE>
<TE>   Our guide boat, the Ocean Breeze, idled about 60 feet off desolate
Shakespeare Beach, between Dover and Folkestone.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's get started," said Whyte, our no-nonsense British pilot.
"It's a long way to France."</TE>
<TE>   That was it. No ceremony. No pep talk. No cheers.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, as 17-year-old Sophie Mitchinson took off her coat, stood
on the deck in her swimsuit, goggles and cap, then jumped into the
64-degree water, the rest of us on the team looked more like stunned
witnesses at the scene of an accident than her relay team partners.</TE>
<TE>   As we watched from the Ocean Breeze, it was too dark to see
anything but the two green glowsticks that had been attached to
Sophie as she swam ashore to officially touch England, then started
back toward us and France.</TE>
<TE>   For the next 11 hours and 29 minutes, the five of us -- four
novices and Mike Read, 62, a former "King of the Channel" with 32
solo swims to his credit -- would withstand one challenge after
another.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With nothing to hang onto and no protection from the bone-chilling
water, an odd combination of fear and boredom sets in as you swim.
Swimmers count, sing or think for distraction.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, as I swam through 4-foot swells, taking occasional
mouthfuls of salt water, I looked out of my foggy goggles to see the
team waving. Lost in my focus on swimming, I had been wandering away
from the boat without realizing it.</TE>
<TE>   "You know," said 38-year-old Matthew Padfield, who had to drop off
the team because of an ear infection while training, "when I saw the
expression on your face, you looked like you thought you were back
home gardening."</TE>
<TE>   Each time I returned to the Ocean Breeze after swimming about two
miles in an hour, I was shivering. Once I finished with a leg cramp.
After two swims, the salt water had left my hands swollen, and they
remained that way for several days.</TE>
<TE>   Then came a challenge even more daunting than the Daina:
seasickness.</TE>
<TE>   After months of training in open-water swimming -- in harbors and
oceans -- we still took seasickness pills the day of the crossing
attempt.</TE>
<TE>   But as we approached mid-channel, soon after the Daina gave us the
scare, two team members -- Morag Hughes and Nick Hunt, both 46 --
started feeling ill.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, both would vomit overboard.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, we had been surprised to hear that an American
man who had begun his solo swim right behind us had lasted only four
hours. The food handouts from his boat had left him violently
seasick.</TE>
<TE>   For members of relay teams, that risk is even greater, since the
guide boats often rock heavily as they slowly follow the swimmer in
the water.</TE>
<TE>   On this overcast day, the seas were so rough that the only way we
avoided falling over on deck was to sit down or hold onto something.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, Sophie, Mike and I were exchanging worried looks, knowing
that if Nick or Morag became too ill to swim, our team would be
disqualified under Channel Swimming Assn. rules that bar any change
in the order of swimmers or having a swimmer drop out after the team
begins.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Somehow, both managed to continue their swimming, partly because
they felt less dizzy in the water than when aboard the Ocean Breeze.</TE>
<TE>   By the time we neared France, a fast current pushing left to right
caused us to miss the harbor we had been aiming for. With all of us
yelling at Nick to swim as fast as possible, he managed to wash up on
a shore of black, slimy rocks.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, Morag and I had jumped in and were swimming after him,
overwhelmed by the emotion of our success.</TE>
<TE>   As we touched shore and stood in France, looking back toward
England and then up at the green farm fields, cliffs and a World War
II bunker, the rush of relief and achievement was phenomenal.</TE>
<TE>   But it didn't last long.</TE>
<TE>   No one was there to greet us, of course. And soon we had to swim
back to the Ocean Breeze so that it could set off for England and
cross the busy waterway before darkness.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all the challenges, enduring the natural forces of the
channel as part of a relay team turned out to be fun and a great
victory.</TE>
<TE>   But I still don't understand why so many people try solo swims, a
far more daunting test of the human spirit. Maybe, like so many
athletes, they simply have unusual strength and willpower.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, even they go too far, however.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the daring Webb.</TE>
<TE>   Even before his channel swim, he had been praised for jumping off
a steamship in Russia during a gale in an unsuccessful effort to save
a crewman washed overboard into bitterly cold waters.</TE>
<TE>   But soon after his channel crossing, Webb's fame began to fade.</TE>
<TE>   So at age 35, he tried a daredevil maneuver that proved too much:
swimming through surging rapids and a large whirlpool in the Niagara
River in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Four days later, his body was found.</TE>

<HD>Malnutrition Threatening Poor Guatemalan Children</HD>
<DH>Last year's drought in Central America destroyed crops that
many families rely on. Emergency aid is in short supply.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Will Weissert</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>INGENIO DE GUARAQUICHE, Guatemala</DL>
<LD>Elvin Munesh hadn't eaten in five days, but he let the wedge of apple
that the aid worker had just given him dangle in his fingers.</LD>
<LD>   The toddler, wearing a tiny blue Mexico Soccer baseball cap,
didn't have the strength to cry or crawl, and his bony arms were too
weak to lift the fruit to his lips, which had begun to turn black
from malnutrition.</LD>
<LD>   "He was doing better, but then last week his mother gave birth to
another baby. Nobody fed him after that," said Lastenia Guerra of
Alliance Against Hunger, a Spanish humanitarian group that runs a
food distribution center in Ingenio de Guaraquiche, a village near
Guatemala's border with Honduras.</LD>
<TE>   Elvin's parents have four other children they are struggling to
feed and didn't have the time or resources to take a break from their
subsistence farming and go with him to the distant hospital, aid
workers said, adding he probably wouldn't survive.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Central America suffered its worst drought in 20 years,
wiping out $189 million worth of corn, beans, sugar and coffee, and
leaving thousands of farming families with nothing to eat. Although
the rains did come this year and authorities are optimistic about the
harvest, emergency aid is running low while the crops ripen.</TE>
<TE>   No country was hit harder than Guatemala, where the U.N. World
Food Program says hunger killed at least 125 infants last year.
Unofficial estimates of the dead are twice as high.</TE>
<TE>   In March, the World Food Program began a $4.8-million emergency
aid program that fed nearly 155,000 Guatemalans, 6,000 of whom were
children under 5 who were in danger of dying.</TE>
<TE>   The government also opened 74 nutrition centers that saved the
lives of nearly 9,000 people in the hardest-hit areas, the Health
Ministry says.</TE>
<TE>   "These people live so close to the margin that malnutrition is
always a problem," said Lola Castro, a director of the World Food
Program's Guatemala office until October. "Even when there is no
drought, thousands of people are in danger."</TE>
<TE>   Funding for the agency's emergency program was scheduled to run
out this month but has been extended through February. The
government's nutrition clinics are more strapped for cash and began
closing at the end of August.</TE>
<TE>   "The drought showed the country just how grave problems of
malnutrition were. When the funding is gone and the aid from the
drought stops, the people will go back to dying, with few outsiders
noticing," said Kevin Mendez, head of a government food center in
Jutiapa, a city more than two hours by four-wheel-drive from Ingenio
de Guaraquiche.</TE>
<TE>   Before the drought, United Nations figures said that half of
Guatemala's children were malnourished and that more than 60% of its
workers earned less than $2 a day.</TE>
<TE>   "The drought programs should be the beginning of aid that lasts
for years, not aid that ends in less than one year," said Candido
Barillas, a Health Ministry spokesman. "But there aren't funds to
help everyone forever."</TE>
<TE>   In Mendez's one-room clinic, eight mothers and their 11
malnourished toddlers were arranged around six hospital beds. A metal
fan did little to ease the stifling heat or disperse the flies that
landed on the infants.</TE>
<TE>   "We have saved the lives of 74 children here. Four of those who
came died," said Mendez, pausing to squash a cockroach that raced up
a children's height chart. "When we are gone, 78 out of the next 78
gravely malnourished children may die."</TE>
<TE>   Even while aid programs are still available, most dangerously ill
children never make it to clinics or hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Malnourished children are everywhere in Ingenio de Guaraquiche, a
village of 900 people, most of them Chorti Mayan Indians. It is
little more than a collection of cinderblock hovels built into muddy
hills among palm and banana trees.</TE>
<TE>   Official statistics for the village aren't available, but locals
said hunger had killed more than 40 people in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Enqunao Mendez's 3-year-old son, Merced, died in December from
diarrhea and malnutrition. Four months later, Mendez, who is not
related to the director of the state clinic, gave birth to Marcelda,
her seventh surviving child.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no food. There was nothing we could do," Merced's
mother said. "We watched him, there in his bed, waiting to die."</TE>
<TE>   Wailing with hunger in a sweat-stained hammock in the family's log
hut, tiny Marcelda looked as if she could face the same end as her
brother. But Enqunao Mendez shrugged off suggestions that she go to
the Alliance Against Hunger food center just across a hilltop soccer
field.</TE>
<TE>   "God will decide whether my children are healthy," she said. "I
don't have time to worry about such matters. There are too many
children to care for."</TE>
<TE>   At the center, Guerra bent down to little Elvin -- nearly 2 years
old but weighing less than a healthy 4-month-old -- and helped him
raise the apple slice to his mouth. As Elvin sucked and chewed, bits
of apple fell on his bare stomach, bloated and doughy from lack of
food.</TE>
<TE>   "There was one more mouth to feed and one of the family members
lost out," Guerra said. "That's the way it usually works around
here."</TE>

<HD>Miners Comb Colombian Hills for a Gem of a Stone</HD>
<DH>Some of the world's best emeralds are found in the South
American nation, but the value of exports has dropped since 1995.
Extracting the stones is strenuous.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Margarita Martinez</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>MUZO, Colombia</DL>
<LD>Centuries ago, the legends say, a jilted Indian princess cried tears
that turned to emeralds, seeding the hidden riches in these lush
mountains that still fire the imagination of treasure hunters.</LD>
<LD>   "You go to sleep every night thinking that tomorrow will be the
day you will get rich," said Victor Alfonso, 45, a miner since he was
6.</LD>
<LD>   Despite a drop in emerald production in Colombia, "green fever"
still burns among miners who yearn to find a stone big or pure enough
to answer all their worldly needs.</LD>
<TE>   "We live on hope here," Alfonso said, his body covered with black
dirt, but his eyes shining with fervor.</TE>
<TE>   Colombia produces 40% of the world's emeralds, says Jean Claude
Michelou, director of the International Colored Gemstone Assn. But
the value of its emerald exports has declined dramatically, from $475
million in 1995, one of the best years, to less than $100 million
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Uncertainties about the quality of Colombian stones, traditionally
some of the best in the world, fueled the drop. Several years ago,
some merchants began to bathe gems in resins that made poor-quality
stones look better -- for a while. The resin fills small fissures in
the stone but changes color over time, making the faults more
noticeable and eroding a stone's value.</TE>
<TE>   With emeralds becoming harder to find in the Muzo mine in
Colombia's central mountains, many miners have given up and left, but
it is still considered the source of some of the world's best
emeralds. The miners who remain are working deeper underground in
search of a sparkle of green.</TE>
<TE>   "There used to be thousands of people searching in the dirt,"
Alfonso said. "Now you have to make huge investments to dig tunnels,
and you see far fewer people digging. Many left because they got
tired of not finding anything."</TE>
<TE>   Coexminas, which operates the Muzo mine, provides the miners with
meals and a place to stay, and it gives miners small shares in the
revenues from the emeralds they find.</TE>
<TE>   Miners are also allowed to take piles of soil out of the tunnel to
search for small emeralds, which they can keep. And miners commonly
sneak out emeralds they find inside the mine.</TE>
<TE>   The work is strenuous.</TE>
<TE>   Deep in tunnels, the miners gouge the earth with picks, breathing
air pumped in through plastic hoses. If they find a worthy emerald,
the money often goes quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing that someone does when they find a big one is buy
a Browning," said miner Gonzalo Rodriguez, referring to a brand of
pistol. "Then a car."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Muzo mine is surrounded by fertile land, there are no
farms.</TE>
<TE>   "People prefer to look for wealth in the mines with the hope of
getting rich than work the land, which would give them a stable
income," said Bishop Hector Gutierrez of the Roman Catholic Diocese
of Muzo.</TE>
<TE>   Colombia's average per capita income is about $2,000 a year, and
farmers often make less. A spectacular emerald can sell for $11,000,
so even the small share that goes to a miner can amount to a lot.</TE>
<TE>   The mine companies run the region, largely abandoned by the
government, providing money for schools, churches, highways and
bridges. Their private security forces keep the peace.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of women and children wait eagerly outside the mine. When a
dusty miner dumps dirt that's already been picked through, the crowd
scuffles over handfuls of it, each hoping to sift it again and
perhaps find an overlooked gem.</TE>
<TE>   People have been mining in the area -- and fighting over the
riches -- for centuries. The native Indians refused to tell the first
Spanish conquerors about the mines. The Spanish responded with
torture and massacres until they stumbled on the Muzo mine.</TE>
<TE>   Violence has periodically ravaged the area over the centuries,
culminating in the "emerald wars" of the 1980s. From 1984 to 1990,
3,500 people died in the struggle for control of the mines.</TE>
<TE>   Intervention by the Catholic Church finally produced a peace
accord, which has left this region a rare haven of peace in a country
in the throes of a 38-year-old civil war.</TE>

<HD>Egyptian Writer Pays High Price for Visit to Israel</HD>
<DH>Ostracized playwright likens himself to Kafka but says he
has no regrets. He calls the journey an attempt to rid himself of
hate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nadia Abou El-Magd</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>Ali Salem was once one of Egypt's most prominent playwrights, but his
curiosity about Israel has brought him expulsion from his country's
cultural circles.</LD>
<LD>   Since visiting Israel in 1994, Salem hasn't found a producer for
his works. He has two plays and a movie script gathering dust and, he
says, nobody talks with him anymore about theater, only about
politics.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm a playwright by nature and a writer by coercion," Salem, who
still writes newspaper columns, said in an interview. "I have become
similar to Kafka's heroes -- I don't know what exactly is demanded of
me."</LD>
<TE>   A big, loud man known for his satiric wit, he had thought about
visiting Israel since the late President Anwar Sadat went to the
Jewish state in 1977. Sadat's visit led to Egypt's becoming the first
Arab state to sign a peace treaty with Israel, in 1979, but many
Egyptians are still outspokenly anti-Israel -- particularly the
leftist intellectuals who once made up Salem's social set.</TE>
<TE>   Salem, a 66-year-old retired Ministry of Culture bureaucrat, has
written about 25 plays and 15 books.</TE>
<TE>   Among his most famous plays is "School of the Troublemakers," a
1971 comedy about a class of riotous teenagers reformed by a kind
female teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Israel and the Palestinians signed the 1993 Oslo
peace agreements, Salem announced plans to visit Israel "to know who
are these people, and what are they doing."</TE>
<TE>   But when he finally went the following year, he told no one, not
even his wife and three daughters. He drove his car across the border
to Israel and stayed for more than three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't a love trip, but a serious attempt to get rid of hate.
Hatred prevents us from knowing reality as it is," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He wrote a series of stories about his trip for an Egyptian weekly
and later a book, "Journey to Israel," published in September 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Fellow writers labeled Salem a sellout, but he replied in print
that those who accused him of working for Israel really understood
that he was "working for Egypt and Egyptians' sake."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sorry for the pain I caused them by my trip -- I forced them
into independent and responsible thinking," Salem wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Intellectuals stopped shaking hands or talking with him. Still not
exactly welcomed in the Egyptian press, Salem contributes columns to
the respected London-based Arab-language newspaper Al Hayat.</TE>
<TE>   After a series of warnings, Salem was expelled last year from the
Writers Syndicate for "his normalization activities with the Zionist
entity," as many Arabs call Israel.</TE>
<TE>   He recently persuaded a court to overturn the union's action, then
resigned, saying he went to court just to prove a point.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the reaction of his fellow intellectuals, Salem's Israel
book was a success. His account of his feelings about visiting places
whose names he had known since childhood and meeting Israelis -- both
Arabs and Jews -- sold more than 60,000 copies.</TE>
<TE>   That made it a best seller by Egyptian standards and perhaps
revealed the hidden curiosity of Egyptians and other Arabs about
Israel. "Journey to Israel" has been translated into Hebrew, and an
English translation titled "A Drive to Israel" appeared this year.</TE>
<TE>   Salem criticizes Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories --
as well as suicide bombings and entreaties for war by Arabs. "I
glorify life, not death," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Since his trip, he has been active in Egyptian and Israeli peace
groups, and has returned to Israel more than 10 times. He has
lectured at Israeli universities and given interviews to Israeli news
media. He doesn't shy from sitting in public with Israelis who come
to Cairo.</TE>
<TE>   Salem deploys humor when addressing serious issues, especially
lack of freedom and its effect on creativity, a recurrent theme in
his work. He delights in skewering officialdom, a habit that can
bring almost as much trouble as a drive to Israel.</TE>
<TE>   In a documentary commissioned by Egyptian American political
rights activist Saad Eddin Ibrahim to encourage Egyptians to vote,
Salem included scenes of people dressed as masked robbers stuffing a
ballot box while a soldier and an election observer slept nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Ibrahim has been convicted and jailed for tarnishing Egypt's
image, an action widely protested by human rights groups. Salem
wasn't charged over the piece, but he was interrogated for five hours
about the script.</TE>
<TE>   "I discovered that one of the most difficult things is to try to
explain a joke," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Salem, speaking in a Cairo hotel coffee shop that he has made his
office -- "I like to sit and write among people I don't know, in
order not to feel isolated" -- said he has no regrets about his drive
to Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't lose anything; I gained self-respect," he said. "I don't
do what I can't defend. I'm ready to apologize when I commit a
mistake, but I'm not ready to deny reality as I see it."</TE>

<HD>AIDS Runs Rampant in S. Africa's Prisons</HD>
<DH>Inmates represent one of the hardest-hit segments in the
country. About 41% carry HIV. Most are unwilling to get the free
testing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeremiah Marquez</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa</DL>
<LD>Prisoners cram into cells soaked in grime and sweat. They share
mattresses, tattoo needles and dirty razors. Rape is common.</LD>
<LD>   South Africa's prisons have become a breeding ground for the AIDS
virus, and prisoners now represent one of the hardest-hit segments of
a country plagued by the deadly disease.</LD>
<LD>   Diseases associated with AIDS -- tuberculosis, for instance --
flourish in the packed and poorly ventilated cells. Other sexually
transmitted diseases, which feed the spread of HIV, are rampant.</LD>
<TE>   With weaker immune systems, prisoners are more contagious and less
resistant to the virus. Those already infected fall ill and die more
quickly. "HIV in South African prisons can be a death sentence," said
K.C. Goyer, who researched prisons for the South African Institute
for Security Studies.</TE>
<TE>   Between 1995 and 2001, deaths surged more than 500% in prisons,
and AIDS is widely held responsible, according to Johannes Fagan, a
judge in charge of monitoring prison conditions in South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,000 of the country's 179,000 inmates died in prison
last year. That number could soar to 45,000 a year by 2011 unless
drastic steps are taken to improve conditions, health care and AIDS
education, Fagan said.</TE>
<TE>   Roughly 41% of all inmates carry HIV, far above the 20% adult
infection rate nationwide, Goyer said. A more precise figure is not
obtainable because the government does not force prisoners to take
AIDS tests.</TE>
<TE>   Although free testing is available, most prisoners -- fearing the
stigma attached to the disease -- remain unwilling to be tested.</TE>
<TE>   Sipho Maphisa, 21, keeps his spirits up dreaming of freedom
outside Johannesburg Prison's barbed-wire fence.</TE>
<TE>   But asked about HIV and his hopes quickly yield to despair.
Maphisa refuses to undergo testing for the deadly virus, convinced
that it would kill him before he finishes the remaining 11 years of a
15-year sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Having HIV "would condemn my whole life because I know I would die
in this place," said Maphisa, who was barred by government officials
from revealing why he was imprisoned. "The support you need [in
prison] is not enough."</TE>
<TE>   Activists said those open about their infection are treated
cruelly and socially isolated because of a crushing stigma over HIV.
Some like Maphisa deal with the disease by simply ignoring it. Other
inmates, many of whom are born into a culture of violence and dire
poverty, doubt whether knowing they are infected will help them.</TE>
<TE>   "To worry about some long-term disease they can't even see is
meaningless to them," said Sasha Gear, a researcher at the Center for
the Study of Violence and Reconciliation. So risky behavior remains
common.</TE>
<TE>   Many share dirty tattoo needles and razors. Thousands are raped
amid the lowered security from overcrowding. And consensual sex is
often unprotected because prisoners rarely have immediate access to
condoms.</TE>
<TE>   The prisons are also terribly overcrowded, with more than 60
inmates commonly sharing a cell designed for 12 and the entire prison
system operating 63% beyond capacity. This cramped environment helps
spread tuberculosis and other deadly diseases that prey on AIDS
patients.</TE>
<TE>   Prisoners, like all other South Africans, do not have access to
anti-AIDS medication through the public health system.</TE>
<TE>   Many inmates contract AIDS before they end up in prison, experts
say. Prison only makes those people sicker.</TE>
<TE>   Although some countries test all prisoners and segregate those
with HIV, South Africa does not, a position applauded by human rights
activists.</TE>
<TE>   A better solution, experts say, lies in curing inmates'
tuberculosis, expanding HIV education programs and providing
anti-AIDS drugs. Relieving overcrowded prisons and making condoms
readily available are also crucial, they say. Without these measures,
the death toll will continue to rise, they say.</TE>

<HD>Sicily Wants to Give the Boot to Its 'Godfather' Image</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nicole Winfield</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>PALERMO, Sicily</DL>
<LD>The Sicily of "Godfather" fame suggests a Mafia-ridden badlands where
family feuds are settled in blood.</LD>
<LD>   The Sicily of a new Saatchi &amp; Saatchi advertising campaign
portrays a Mediterranean paradise with spectacular beaches,
5th-century Greek temples and orange groves.</LD>
<LD>   It's tough to know where image and reality meet in Sicily,
historically a place apart in map and mind from "il continente," as
Sicilians refer to the boot-shaped mainland of Italy.</LD>
<TE>   The Italian government, though, is trying to bury the island's
less-than-sunny reputation as a mob haven by highlighting it as a
tourist and business destination.</TE>
<TE>   It has launched a new publicity campaign and given the go-ahead to
a decades-old idea to build a bridge to the mainland that authorities
say will bring visitors and investment to the island.</TE>
<TE>   Construction of the two-mile rail-and-road bridge, the world's
longest, is to begin by 2005 and be completed by 2011, its
$4.7-billion price tag split between the public and private sector.</TE>
<TE>   And that's precisely where Sicily's Mafia reality may come into
play.</TE>
<TE>   There are fears that the bidding and building will be tainted by
mobs that have long held sway over construction on the island.</TE>
<TE>   On a profit this size, "the Mafia will make a tremendous amount of
money," said Gianfranco Pasquino, a former leftist senator and member
of the government's Anti-Mafia Commission in the 1980s and '90s.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way the Italian state can control it," he said. "They
can find a decent entrepreneur, [but the Mafia] can blackmail him."</TE>
<TE>   Government officials promise controls to ensure that bidding and
construction are clean.</TE>
<TE>   "We will follow all procedures of transparency to avoid any type
of polluting" of the process, said Pietro Ciucci, chief executive of
Stretto di Messina, the government company responsible for the
project.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say the bridge and related rail, road and port
development projects will reduce the mob's economic hold on Sicily,
and boost employment in one of Italy's poorest regions.</TE>
<TE>   The Mafia's hold on Sicily has diminished over the past 10 years,
with top bosses behind bars and an estimated $500 million in assets
confiscated by the state, police say.</TE>
<TE>   The crackdown began after the mob killed two crusading anti-gang
prosecutors in 1992 at the height of the Mafia's years-long violent
campaign against the state. The deaths of Giovanni Falcone and Paolo
Borsellino sparked an unprecedented wave of popular revulsion that
prompted the government to step up its anti-mob war.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years later, the mob is still around, and there are
indications that the bosses are ready to violently strike again.</TE>
<TE>   Jailed dons began protests in July to complain about tough prison
conditions, which include isolation cells, and only one monthly visit
and phone call.</TE>
<TE>   Citing intelligence documents, La Repubblica newspaper reported in
September that the mob was preparing a "new season" of bloodletting
to make its protests heard, and would also target politicians who
hadn't honored promises to the mob. Intelligence officials have since
publicly confirmed the report.</TE>
<TE>   In this fraught atmosphere, even a bureaucratic matter of office
space takes on a sinister meaning for some.</TE>
<TE>   In Corleone, birthplace of the fictional "Godfather," Vito
Corleone, a new town government has taken over a conference room of
the International Mafia Documentation Center, saying it needs more
space.</TE>
<TE>   But some are asking whether it means that the center and its
museum of Mafia history are being downgraded and that authorities
have lost their stomach for fighting the mob.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a question of space; it's a symbolic question," said
Claudio Di Palermo, a former leftist politician who runs a stationery
store in Corleone.</TE>
<TE>   "If people forget that the problem exists, then there's the risk
that people start to live with it as if it's natural," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Angelo Vintaloro, chief of staff to Corleone's current mayor,
insists that it's all innocuous, saying the conference room was empty
anyway.</TE>
<TE>   But Corleone's former mayor has formally complained to the Italian
president, the United Nations and a host of regional authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Sicilian authorities would rather highlight the island's potential
for business and such treasures as the baroque cities of Noto and
Ragusa, recently added to UNESCO's World Heritage List.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi features pictures of beaches,
archeological sites and the snowcapped Mt. Etna volcano, each with a
tiny image of a bikini-clad woman hidden in the photo.</TE>
<TE>   "Sicily is so beautiful we don't need tricks to attract you," the
headline says.</TE>
<TE>   The region's president, Salvatore Cuffaro, explained the necessity
of the campaign, saying Sicily's image both abroad and in the rest of
Italy "is often a distorted image, constructed by the mass media,
that all too often doesn't correspond to reality."</TE>
<TE>   "The problem of organized crime certainly is a problem," he said.
"But it doesn't seem to me that this alone can construct an image of
a region."</TE>
<TE>   Giovanni Ruggirello, whose family runs a cafe in the center of
Corleone, concurs.</TE>
<TE>   "People come here because of 'The Godfather' and they expect to
see men with holsters," he said. "Instead, they find flowers."</TE>
<TE>   He pointed to the trend of Danish couples getting married in
Corleone. Nine couples have exchanged vows there since 1997, but less
out of a Mafia fixation than because it's a pretty little town, said
the Danish consul general in Palermo, Hanne Carstensen.</TE>
<TE>   The Mafia isn't Sicily's only problem. The island consistently
lags behind the rest of Italy economically, with a 19% unemployment
rate that pushes the national average up to about 9%.</TE>
<TE>   But it is organized crime that casts the darkest cloud.</TE>
<TE>   In Palermo's Vucciria market, a fishmonger named Angelo said the
Mafia's shadow made him feel like he was living in medieval times.</TE>
<TE>   "There is some development," he said. "But this criminality....
Their interests are above the tragedy."</TE>

<HD>Things Are Looking Up for Denver, Rocky Mountains</HD>
<DH>City is more than a mile high, it turns out. More accurate
measurements, not geologic changes, are responsible.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sarah Cooke</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>The Mile High City nickname comes up a little short these days.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Geodetic Survey's newest calculations show that some
parts of the city, including the state capitol, are 3 feet higher
than reputation would have it. But geologists stressed that doesn't
mean that Denver needs to change its famous nickname, and the mayor's
office said there are no plans to do so.</LD>
<LD>   "The Mile High City is kind of a signature name for Denver, and I
think that will always remain," said Andrew Hudson, spokesman for
Mayor Wellington Webb. "It sounds sort of unreasonable to say the
mile-high-plus-3-feet city."</LD>
<TE>   Reflecting cartographic accuracy more than geologic uplifting, the
new calculations set the official heights of many Colorado landmarks
and the central Rockies as much as 7 feet higher than previously
thought.</TE>
<TE>   The changes weren't big enough to shake up the rankings of any of
the state's 54 14,000-foot peaks or create any new 14ers.</TE>
<TE>   Pikes Peak west of Colorado Springs gained 5 feet to 14,115 feet,
while Longs Peak in north-central Colorado gained 4 feet. The state's
highest point, Mt. Elbert near Leadville, gained 7 feet to make it
14,440 feet above sea level.</TE>
<TE>   Other areas of the country also changed, but some of the biggest
differences were found in the central Rockies, where the range's
strong gravitational pull has thrown off instruments used to measure
elevation since the days of the Hayden survey in the 19th century.</TE>
<TE>   In Wyoming, Grand Teton in Grand Teton National Park increased 5
feet to 13,775 feet above sea level. Franc's Peak in the bordering
Shoshone National Forest grew by 6 feet to 13,164 feet.</TE>
<TE>   The highest point in Montana, Granite Peak, also jumped 6 feet to
12,807 feet, while Wheeler Peak in northern New Mexico is now 13,167
feet, about 5 feet higher than previously thought.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't that the old surveys are wrong; it just means we have a
new starting point," said Jack Reed, geologist with the U.S.
Geological Survey. "It doesn't necessarily mean the mountains are
getting bigger."</TE>
<TE>   The revisions actually came about in the 1990s, when Congress
formally adopted the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1988, but
are just now starting to show up on maps.</TE>
<TE>   Number-crunchers at the U.S. Geodetic Survey used thousands of
benchmarks created since the last comprehensive survey in 1929 to
recalculate what is known as the geoid, an imaginary surface used to
measure elevation that represents sea level.</TE>
<TE>   Geologists also used satellite data that shows, within
millimeters, where the center of the earth's gravity lies, said
Richard Cohen, Colorado's advisor to the U.S. Geodetic Survey.</TE>
<TE>   "Some parts of the United States changed a little bit, while some
parts changed a lot," he said. "Of course, we have a lot of elevation
here, so our numbers changed quite a bit."</TE>
<TE>   Colorado's elevation rose an average of 3 feet. Changes in flatter
areas of the country, such as the Midwest and East Coast, measured
less than a foot, Cohen said.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, where things are flat, it doesn't make much of a
difference," Reed said.</TE>
<TE>   In Denver, a team of surveyors will spend a weekend running levels
from four geographic benchmarks surrounding the capitol to install
the capitol's new mile-high marker, probably next spring, said
Herbert W. Stoughton, a surveyor who heads Metro State College of
Denver's surveying and mapping program.</TE>
<TE>   "Every observation we read, we read to a tenth of a millimeter....
It takes very precise, very specialized equipment to do this," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Two markers, one a brass cap and one an inscription, already line
the steps claiming to mark the spot where the capitol sits one mile
above sea level.</TE>
<TE>   The inscription, which reads "One Mile Above Sea Level," was
carved into the steps in 1947 after repeated thefts of a brass plaque
at the top of the steps, according to state archives.</TE>
<TE>   New measurements by a group of Colorado State University
engineering students in 1969 prompted installation of the brass cap
three steps higher. The new marker will likely sit a few steps higher
than that.</TE>
<TE>   So how can capitol visitors make sure they're standing exactly one
mile above sea level?</TE>
<TE>   "My suggestion is you should lay across about six steps," said Dan
Hopkins, spokesman for Gov. Bill Owens.</TE>

<HD>Pressing Issue in Washington: Making Ice Wine</HD>
<DH>Low temperatures early in the season that freeze ripe fruit
on the vine are essential to producing a super-sweet drink with
concentrated flavor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Linda Ashton</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>YAKIMA, Wash.</DL>
<LD>A killing freeze in central Washington turned out to be icing on the
grape for some wineries with fruit still in the vineyard.</LD>
<LD>   "This was a welcome surprise and a rare opportunity for us," said
Erik Olsen, winemaker at Chateau Ste. Michelle in Woodinville. "All
of the necessary conditions for ice wine came together -- low
temperatures early in the season and ripe, healthy fruit still
hanging on the vine."</LD>
<LD>   A 15-person crew waited under a starry sky Oct. 31 in the Horse
Heaven vineyard until temperatures dropped to 12 degrees at 3 a.m.,
then spent three hours picking frozen Riesling grapes.</LD>
<TE>   "Handling the grapes was like holding marbles," Olsen said. "It's
important to harvest and press the grapes while still entirely hard
frozen. Under pressure, the berries give up juice that is highly
concentrated in sugar and flavor, while water, in the form of ice, is
left behind."</TE>
<TE>   The sweetness is measurable -- 42 degrees on the Brix scale,
compared with 23 degrees Brix for a Chateau Ste. Michelle chardonnay.</TE>
<TE>   Chateau Ste. Michelle, part of the Stimson Lane wine company, has
made ice wine only two other times, in 1978 and 1995. This freeze's
crop will yield about 300 cases.</TE>
<TE>   At Washington Hills Cellars, winemaker Flint Nelson likes it even
colder when he makes ice wine for the Sunnyside winery's Apex label.
He's waiting for the overnight temperature to drop to 10 degrees in
the Outlook vineyard. The last time the winery made ice wine was Dec.

<TE>   "It's very difficult to make and very labor-intensive, especially
when it's 10 degrees Fahrenheit. Working outside, it's miserable," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very slow process to press the little bit of juice you get
out of them. The yields are very low."</TE>
<TE>   The Apex ice wine is made from Gewurztraminer grapes that are left
on the vine in anticipation of frigid temperatures.</TE>
<TE>   He expects to make about 400 cases of 375-milliliter bottles that
will sell for about $35 apiece, compared with a regular
750-milliliter bottle of Gewurztraminer that would sell for under
$10.</TE>
<TE>   Covey Run, also in Sunnyside, will make about 1,500 cases of
Riesling ice wine and 1,200 cases from semillon grapes, all in
half-bottles as well.</TE>
<TE>   "That little bottle has as many grapes in it as a standard size --
what's missing is the water," winemaker Kerry Norton said. "It's very
flavorful, very sweet, very rich and very yummy."</TE>
<TE>   It was 9 degrees in Covey Run's semillon vineyard near Zillah when
the grapes were picked. The decision to set up the machinery, pick
the grapes and make the wine was made on the spur of the moment, once
Norton realized that there was going to be a hard freeze.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a once-in-several-years opportunity," Norton said. "We
had the grapes and we had the conditions, so we went for it."</TE>
<TE>   Washington is the nation's second-largest wine producer, behind
California, with more than 200 wineries and 28,000 acres planted in
wine grapes.</TE>
<TE>   This season's ice wines will be available next year.</TE>

<HD>Mushroom Pickers Take On Forest Service, Loggers</HD>
<DH>Harvesters of prized matsutakes say timber sales in prime
areas in Oregon will threaten their livelihood. The agency is trying
to work out a compromise.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>CRESCENT JUNCTION, Ore.</DL>
<LD>It's just above freezing outside, but inside a long makeshift tent
dubbed "The Noodle House," bowls of steaming soup and vegetable
stir-fry add to the warmth seeping from a small wood stove.</LD>
<LD>   On most nights, the dimly lighted tent serves as a cozy gathering
place for the several hundred Thai, Cambodian and Laotian pickers who
camp out in central Oregon each fall to hunt the elusive and valuable
matsutake mushroom, a Japanese delicacy. On this night, however, the
casual chatter has turned into a roiling debate about Forest Service
plans to log the best matsutake habitat around.</LD>
<LD>   Matsutake harvesters have for years stayed out of the debate on
federal forest management and timber sales, preferring to quietly
follow the mushroom crop south in a six-month migratory march from
British Columbia to Southern California.</LD>
<TE>   But that isolationist mentality changed abruptly last fall when
pickers noticed trees tagged for logging on 2,400 acres of the
Crescent Ranger District of Deschutes National Forest -- often
considered the most fertile matsutake mushroom habitat in North
America.</TE>
<TE>   The resulting consternation transformed the tent at the pickers'
main campground in the tiny outpost of Crescent Junction from a
laid-back gathering place to an impromptu debate hall, where
harvesters young and old meet at least once a week to discuss the
fate of their prime mushroom patches. On a recent night, two dozen
harvesters collected forest maps and Forest Service documents on the
proposed timber sales after listening to Ranger Phil Cruz explain the
need for the thinning projects.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm interested in how the logging will affect the mushroom
people. I heard that if the tree has been cut, the mushroom won't
grow," said Nancy Souksavath, 18, who traveled from Denver with her
family to pick matsutakes. "How will that affect the pickers in the
future? Some people really depend on the mushrooms for a living."</TE>
<TE>   Collecting the white, fist-sized mushrooms is more than an idle
pastime for thousands of harvesters -- most of them low-income
Southeast Asian families -- who travel from forest to forest each
summer and fall. The majority who descend on the national forests
depend on the mushroom harvest for most of their income.</TE>
<TE>   In one extraordinary year that is still the stuff of legends, the
best matsutakes sold for nearly $300 a pound. Most years, however,
prices from Japanese buyers stay below $25 a pound for top-grade
mushrooms, with spikes of as much as $35 a pound during better
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   About 10% to 20% of the matsutakes sold annually to Japan come
from the North American market, buyers estimate, and during a good
year, pickers say they can net $10,000 in two months of 12-hour days.
Pickers buy Forest Service permits for as much as $200 that allow
them to trek the forests with 25-pound buckets, searching for
matsutakes.</TE>
<TE>   Some keep as many as 150 prime patches on global positioning
systems, said Rick Bond, a forester who runs the matsutake permit
program in the Chemult Ranger District.</TE>
<TE>   "Mushroom pickers have to have a lot of patience. It's a lot of
walking and walking," said Hong Vor, a 44-year-old picker who spends
10 months a year running a restaurant in South Bend, Wash., and two
months a year hunting matsutakes. "Sometimes you look for 30 days and
there's nothing, and then there is one day that can make all the
difference."</TE>
<TE>   But pickers, who have long made a point of distancing themselves
from the Forest Service, fear that without intervention, there will
be no matsutakes in large swaths of prime picking areas.</TE>
<TE>   The pickers and local environmentalists who are helping them say
logging in the areas where mushrooms grow will mean the end of
matsutakes, which depend on a symbiotic relationship with the roots
of the firs and pines they grow under. Harvesters are concerned that
logging equipment will tear up the mushrooms' fragile root system and
allow in sunlight that will dry up the moist soil where the fungus
grows best.</TE>
<TE>   In an unprecedented move, harvesters met this spring with the
Forest Service and signed a petition asking the agency to reconsider
the timber sales, and include harvesters in current and future
discussion about logging in matsutake habitat.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz has since canceled part of one timber sale and placed others
on hold while the two sides try to find a compromise. In addition, at
the pickers' request, the Forest Service for the first time last fall
extended the picking season in central Oregon by one week to make up
for a bad season.</TE>
<TE>   "Harvesters were just afraid to speak out. They didn't seem to
feel safe about doing that before," said Katie Bagby, coordinator for
Pacific West Community Forestry Center in Taylorsville, Calif.
"There's certainly more speaking out now -- and sometimes all at
once. It's very interesting."</TE>
<TE>   Cruz said he was surprised at the depth of concern about the
timber sales and didn't realize that they contained prime picking
areas within them. Part of the challenge before this year, he said,
was getting picker input of any kind.</TE>
<TE>   "The concern was much more heartfelt than I had ever been able to
judge before because I didn't get any feedback from the Anglos or
Asians or any group whatsoever," he said. "Progress is not made
smoothly; it's made in herks and jerks. I think we were going to get
to this point eventually, but this spring, it just kind of plopped
itself in front of my face."</TE>
<TE>   At weekly meetings at the pickers' camp, Cruz said he and
harvesters have agreed on which sales would jeopardize the best
matsutake patches and explored alternatives, such as helicopter
logging or limited logging in some areas. The Forest Service recently
took some pickers on a field trip of timber sales already underway to
show them the impact on the soil.</TE>
<TE>   A logging decision that takes into account the pickers' interests
should come this month, but those representing the harvesters say
they're concerned that the Forest Service didn't consider the impact
of logging on the loose-knit community sooner. Because the logging
could wipe out an entire community's source of income, the groups
say, the agency should have considered the timber sales' impact
without pressure from harvesters and watchdog groups.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very important piece of people's yearly income, and
they're dependent on this resource in the forest. Decisions have been
made without their participation that affect the safety of that
resource," Bagby said. "This is about people who have been
marginalized."</TE>
<TE>   Some within the Forest Service see the inclusion of harvesters in
logging discussions as the evolution of the agency's role. The
mushroom program, for example, grew from nothing in the mid-1980s to
include the five-language translator and brochures in as many
languages as it has today.</TE>

<HD>Could a Cry for Help Have Saved Baby's Life?</HD>
<DH>Grandmother warned that the infant was in peril, but
officials say they were powerless. Father is charged with murder,

<DL>LAFAYETTE, Colo.</DL>
<LD>Even before her stepson's baby was born, Lea Dowler was so worried
about the parents' ability to care for the newborn that she wrote to
a hospital, pleading that someone help them.</LD>
<LD>   No one did.</LD>
<LD>   Within eight weeks of his birth, Tanner Dowler's arms, legs and
ribs had been broken. His burned feet had been wrapped in toilet
paper and his face scratched. He died Oct. 12, nine days after his
parents brought him to a hospital and were arrested.</LD>
<TE>   "It's the worst case I've ever seen in 30 years," Lafayette Police
Chief Paul Schultz said.</TE>
<TE>   As Joseph and Audra Dowler face charges in Tanner's death, state
authorities are investigating whether Lea Dowler's plea for help to
the hospital -- and later to Boulder County officials -- was ignored.
A report from Colorado's Human Services Department is expected in
about six weeks.</TE>
<TE>   State child protection officials, who oversee county agencies,
said a letter like Lea Dowler's would have been too vague to prompt
an investigation because it did not provide the Dowlers' address or
an indication that the child would be harmed. The couple had been
living in their car.</TE>
<TE>   "We walk a fine line on when we should protect a child or intrude
on family life," said Christine Highnam, director of Boulder County's
Department of Social Services. "A general concern, with no other
detail, is probably something that we have no right to go knocking on
somebody's door and intervene in their lives."</TE>
<TE>   Lea Dowler's letter to county officials questioned how the parents
would feed the baby, wash his clothes and pay for his care without
county and state aid.</TE>
<TE>   Lea Dowler and her husband, Woody, did not return a message left
at their Brighton residence. A woman who answered the door at the
house declined a request for an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for Joseph and Audra Dowler did not return calls for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   After Lea Dowler wrote the letter, Audra and Joseph Dowler moved
into a low-budget motel. Audra worked at a pizza parlor while her
husband stayed home with Tanner, according to a police report.</TE>
<TE>   In June, Lea Dowler wrote to Platte Valley Medical Center in
Longmont and asked officials to locate the couple and give them
parenting classes. The baby was born Aug. 10, and Lea Dowler sent her
letter to Boulder County two days later.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a plea for help for them all," the letter to the county
said. "Our grandson has to be protected and raised healthy and happy.
We want to be a part of his life -- his long, healthy life."</TE>
<TE>   Police said Audra Dowler, 19, told authorities that she and her
husband pinned the baby's arms behind his back so he wouldn't pull
out his pacifier and then covered his face with pillows to muffle his
cries.</TE>
<TE>   Tanner became lethargic and stopped eating at least two days
before he was taken to the hospital, according to the police report.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I broke our son," Audra quoted Joseph as saying,
according to police.</TE>
<TE>   Early on Oct. 3, Tanner let out a shriek that Audra told police
sounded like "a cat's tail in a rocking chair." She finished her
shift later that evening and, together with her husband, took him to
a hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Tanner's death left some officers in tears. A few needed to talk
to counselors. Dozens of people attended a public viewing.</TE>
<TE>   "He was such a beautiful baby, so perfect," neighbor Nancy Audley
said.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Dowler, 34, has been charged with first-degree murder and
child abuse. His next hearing is scheduled for Jan. 14. Audra Dowler
has been charged with child abuse. Her next hearing is scheduled for
Jan. 9. Both are behind bars. His bail has been set at $1 million,
hers at $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Dowler's family said he is taking the brunt of the blame to
protect his wife.</TE>
<TE>   "She was his first true love," Lea Dowler told the Boulder Daily
Camera.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the latest figures available, 31 children died from child
abuse or neglect in Colorado. Nationwide, that figure was 1,236,
according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, Tanner Dowler is one data point in these 1,200
deaths a year," said Dr. Andrew Sirotnak, director of the Kempe Child
Protection Team at Children's Hospital, which has developed national
programs to prevent child abuse. "It's another tragic case of a
family that needed help and didn't get it."</TE>
<TE>   State Rep. Gayle Berry, a Grand Junction Republican who has
sponsored legislation to protect children, said it seemed as if there
was nothing officials could have done.</TE>
<TE>   "Resources are out there; the abuse is already illegal, yet these
sad tragedies still happen," Berry said.</TE>

<HD>The Price Is Right for These Books</HD>
<DH>A former bartender gives away about 25,000 volumes a week,
and thousands of people visit his store on weekends. He hopes to
expand to other cities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Reagan Haynes</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>Bartenders know that people complain at happy hour. They hear patrons
chatter about co-workers, office politics or, in the case of a group
of teachers at Dougherty's Pub, the book shortage at their school.</LD>
<LD>   They nod and pour drinks.</LD>
<LD>   But Russell Wattenberg listened and started putting aside 10% of
his tips. He scavenged at thrift shops, used bookstores and yard
sales, and gave his finds to his customers. When neighbors heard
about the beefy bartender donating books to teachers, they dug out
more from their attics and brought them in.</LD>
<TE>   "People heard and they donated more books, and it just kind of
grew and grew and grew until I quit the bar to do it full-time,"
Wattenberg said. "Now I'm giving away about 20,000 to 25,000 books a
week and there's about a thousand people coming through each
weekend."</TE>
<TE>   So was born the Book Thing of Baltimore, a nonprofit organization
that gives books to whoever wants them. It is run by Wattenberg -- a
chain-smoking, wry man of 30 who says he cries whenever he reads one
of his favorites, "Of Mice and Men."</TE>
<TE>   After receiving international attention for the store in the
Charles Village neighborhood near Johns Hopkins University,
Wattenberg hopes to expand to other cities. He's received calls from
people interested in bringing the Book Thing to Boston, Philadelphia,
Seattle and Washington, but said he's still waiting for the right
offer.</TE>
<TE>   The cellar he's been operating from for the past 2 1/2 years
features a sign screaming "Free Books" that directs customers to the
back of the rented house. The store is packed with shelf-to-shelf
books. Spaces are carved out for different genres -- pop fiction is
the most crowded. Boxes of more books litter the unfinished floor
and, in front of those, stacks of yet more books. Add shoppers to the
mix and there's not much room to move around.</TE>
<TE>   But 250,000 selections make it worthwhile.</TE>
<TE>   Wattenberg accepts any book -- any book without mold.</TE>
<TE>   "Strawberries in the 21st Century?" His shop has it. "Advice From
a Failure" has passed through his hands.</TE>
<TE>   Wattenberg wants your 20-year-old National Geographics that are
collecting dust.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not a book that comes in that nobody wants," he said.
"There are tax tables from the 1960s that some art student will use
for decoupage."</TE>
<TE>   "The Waring Blender Cookbook" is snapped up by two Johns Hopkins
students who giggle over the title.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Johnson, a regular at the Book Thing, brings his unwanted
books here. He walks inside and pulls a book called "Wise Women" off
a shelf and tucks it under his arm.</TE>
<TE>   "I see piles of books in the trash; a lot of them are good books,"
Johnson said, almost incredulously.</TE>
<TE>   Because he spends so much time picking up books, soliciting books
and sorting books, Wattenberg can keep the Book Thing open only on
weekends.</TE>
<TE>   Each morning, he arrives to empty a 24-hour drop-off bin in front
of the little store, which is filled to overflowing. He weeds through
the books. He pulls out high-value contributions that will benefit
the Book Thing, such as a first-edition "Grapes of Wrath" that sold
for $1,200 at an auction.</TE>
<TE>   He removes books that he and his 30 regular volunteers might want
to read, knowing that most will eventually return to the rotation. On
Wednesdays, his helpers crowd in and sort through the rest of the
week's donations.</TE>
<TE>   Funding for the Book Thing comes from fellowships and private
donors, as well as high-value books. All contribute to Wattenberg's
$36,000 salary. (He's the only paid employee of the Book Thing.)</TE>
<TE>   Although he jokes that it'll ruin his reputation, Wattenberg said
his main motivation for running a free bookstore is to give books to
people who can't afford to buy them at the thrift store.</TE>
<TE>   "The more means and money someone has, the lighter their reading
is," he said. "But when people aren't where they want to be in life,
those are the people who want to better themselves. They thirst for
knowledge and learning."</TE>
<TE>   But money is tight, and Wattenberg recently laid himself off after
a failed transmission in the store's ancient van diminished already
dwindling funds. But he wouldn't have it any other way.</TE>
<TE>   "People who give the books are happy to have a place to give them,
and people who get them are happy to get them," Wattenberg said. "And
I get to be around books all day."</TE>
<TE>   On this day, he intercepts a couple threading their way through
boxes of books.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey there! Are you folks new here?" When they nod their assent,
Wattenberg gestures to piles of books stacked on the pavement:
"Everything over here is free. Everything inside is also free. Greed
is encouraged."</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>It was one of the most startling brain discoveries in recent history:
the finding, announced in 1998, that people keep making new brain
cells well into adulthood.</LD>
<LD>   Now scientists are looking into another surprising idea, that
waning and waxing of this brain-cell birthing contributes to
depression and the effects of antidepressants.</LD>
<LD>   It's more than an academic question. If it's true, it could help
unlock the riddle of just what goes wrong in the brain to bring on
the mood disease. And it could help lead to better treatments, such
as faster-acting antidepressants.</LD>
<TE>   The theory focuses on the hippocampus, a structure deep in the
brain that plays a key role in learning and memory. This is where
scientists reported finding new cells in autopsied brains from adults
in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The idea that the rate of brain cell birth, called neurogenesis,
in the hippocampus affects depression is still in its infancy. It has
met skepticism in the field. And even its advocates stress that a
decrease in neurogenesis in the hippocampus would clearly not be the
only brain change involved in bringing on depression.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the evidence for the theory is only sketchy. But it's hard
to ignore a pattern in some recent findings in lab animals:</TE>
<TE>   * Stress, which plays a key role in triggering depression,
suppresses neurogenesis in the hippocampus.</TE>
<TE>   * Antidepressants, on the other hand, encourage the birth of new
brain cells.</TE>
<TE>   * Animals must take antidepressants for two or three weeks before
they bump up the birth rate of brain cells, and the cells take maybe
another two weeks to start functioning. That's consistent with the
lag time antidepressants show before they lift mood in people.</TE>
<TE>   * If an antidepressant is given during a period of chronic stress,
it prevents the decline in neurogenesis that normally occurs.</TE>
<TE>   * Exercise, which combats depression in people, also promotes
neurogenesis in the hippocampus.</TE>
<TE>   * So does electroconvulsive therapy, popularly known as shock
treatment, which works in human cases of severe depression.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists have also found evidence that the hippocampus shrinks
in people who have had long-standing depression, although they
haven't pinned that on a shortfall in new brain cells. The finding
might reflect shrinkage of existing brain cells instead.</TE>
<TE>   All in all, the evidence shows correlations between reduced
neurogenesis and depression, but there isn't a smoking gun
demonstrating cause and effect yet, says Fred Gage of the Salk
Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Gage, who reported the appearance of new brain cells in human
adults in 1998, said he suspects a link to depression.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of people working on this," he said. "I think
there's no lack of enthusiasm."</TE>
<TE>   Barry Jacobs, a neuroscientist at Princeton University who
published the theory with Gage in 2000, said he's now emphasizing the
other side of the coin: the possibility that increased neurogenesis
promotes recovery from depression.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there are probably many more things that can plunge a
person into depression, and I'm not even sure the critical trigger is
this change in the hippocampus," Jacobs said. "Once they've tumbled
down into depression, it may be that the change [in neurogenesis] is
what keeps them depressed."</TE>
<TE>   The idea, he speculated, is that the shortfall in new brain cells
might impair a depressed person's ability to make the mental changes
needed to climb back out of the mood disorder.</TE>
<TE>   If boosting neurogenesis really would help people recover from
depression, it could give scientists a new target for creating better
antidepressants -- even if a shortfall in neurogenesis doesn't have
much to do with creating the depression in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Ronald Duman of Yale University, who studies how
antidepressants work and how they spur neurogenesis, said one benefit
could be faster-acting medications.</TE>
<TE>   "That's really the silver bullet the field has been looking for,"
Duman said. "If you have a depressed, suicidal person who comes in
for treatment, you don't want to have to put them on a drug for four
to six weeks" to get an initial response, especially when the first
drug might fail.</TE>
<TE>   Antidepressants might work in part by spurring neurogenesis in the
hippocampus, and that could prove to be one important action to shoot
for in new drugs, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Duman said he believes that the drugs must exert effects
elsewhere in the brain as well. After all, depression brings a bundle
of problems -- not just low mood, but also abnormalities in sexual
drive, eating and sleeping, for example. So it makes sense that
several regions of the brain are troubled and that they all have to
change for the disease to lift, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some brain scientists doubt that brain cell production in the
hippocampus contributes to bringing on depression.</TE>
<TE>   Given the known jobs of the hippocampus on one hand, and the
symptoms of depression on the other, "it feels like a pretty strange
path to get from a hippocampus that's not working very well to
increased risk of depression," said Robert M. Sapolsky of Stanford
University.</TE>
<TE>   Sapolsky does think that there might be a link, but in the other
direction: Depression might hamper neurogenesis in the hippocampus.
If that's true, he said, it might explain certain memory problems
that sometimes appear in depression.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody agrees that new research, and even new research methods,
will be needed to demonstrate whether brain-cell birthing has
anything to do with depression.</TE>
<TE>   Animal experiments provide only imperfect imitations of human
depression, notes Dr. Yvette Sheline of Washington University in St.
Louis.</TE>
<TE>   She has found that the more times women have been depressed, the
smaller their hippocampi tend to be. She's now trying to find a way
to measure the amount of neurogenesis in people during periods of
depression.</TE>
<TE>   She warns, though, that studying anatomical brain changes won't
completely explain the mystery of what causes depression. The answer
will no doubt involve disruptions in brain cell functioning, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the relationship between depression and brain-cell birth,
the whole line of research illustrates an important and
under-appreciated fact about the nature of depression.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not self-indulgence; this is not failure of will,"
Sapolsky said. "This is as biological a disease as diabetes."</TE>

<HD>Suspicious Inferno Illuminates a Murky Past</HD>
<DH>Man paces outside his burning house with his wife and son
trapped inside. How could he leave them, officers wonder, even to

<SE>First in a weekly series</SE>

<DL>CARY, Ill.</DL>
<LD>The fire on High Road was an angry monster.</LD>
<LD>   It ripped through the roof of the wood-frame house, shattered
windows and wrecked everything in its path, its hot breath searing
walls black.</LD>
<LD>   The fire sprang to life about 2 a.m. in the living room, near a
Christmas tree. In minutes, flames filled the room, then roared along
the hallways, blowtorch-hot, eating into beams and timbers.</LD>
<TE>   Thick smoke billowed up the stairs, into the rooms, under the
beds.</TE>
<TE>   In a second-floor hallway, the plastic shell of a smoke detector
attached to the ceiling began to melt, curling inward to the place
where a 9-volt battery should have been.</TE>
<TE>   Through the eaves, tongues of flame licked upward, lighting the
sky for blocks around with a false dawn.</TE>
<TE>   A neighbor who peered out his window from across the street saw a
husky man silhouetted in the eerie glow, pacing quickly back and
forth, staring at the burning house.</TE>
<TE>   This figure, shoeless and wearing pajamas despite the snow and
10-degree cold, was John T. Veysey III.</TE>
<TE>   "Help, get my wife and kid out!" Veysey shouted as he ran toward
Sgt. Edward Fetzer, the first police officer to arrive.</TE>
<TE>   The two men hurried to the side of the house. Fetzer got down on
hands and knees and Veysey stood on his back, using the officer's
flashlight to break a window. Glass rained down on Fetzer. Then
Veysey fell.</TE>
<TE>   The officer found a ladder, climbed to the window and shined the
flashlight in. All he could see was black smoke.</TE>
<TE>   From somewhere inside came a groan.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me go in!" Veysey said in a voice that seemed filled with
panic.</TE>
<TE>   No one was stopping him. But, Fetzer noticed, Veysey made no move.</TE>
<TE>   "Where is the fire department?" Veysey wailed.</TE>
<TE>   Fetzer looked at him. He was rumpled and he seemed half-crazed
with worry, but the sergeant could see no serious injuries, no burns
or bruises.</TE>
<TE>   How had he managed to get out? Why were his wife and son still
inside? Fetzer had no time to pursue those questions.</TE>
<TE>   In the days ahead, many more questions would surface, and the
answers would reveal that this was just the latest disaster in John
Veysey's life.</TE>
<TE>   His aura of doom would soon pique the interest of a detective on
the small police force in Cary, a village an hour outside Chicago,
and his suspicions would grow the more he discovered. In time -- and
the case would take years and reach far beyond this town -- others
would dig deeper, including dogged prosecutors and a team of federal
agents, one of them a sleuth who had traveled the world, unraveling
the mysteries of fire.</TE>
<TE>   But now, on this freezing morning in January 1998, the first
priority was to stop the High Road fire from becoming a killer.</TE>
<TE>   A few blocks away, the radio pager on the night table beside Brad
Delatorre's bed began beeping.</TE>
<TE>   "Structure fire at 342 High Road. People trapped," a dispatcher's
voice intoned. Delatorre, a volunteer firefighter in Cary, forced
himself awake.</TE>
<TE>   The four-block drive to the fire station took less than a minute.</TE>
<TE>   Delatorre hustled into bunker pants and rubber boots and pulled a
Nomex fireproof hood over his head. He jumped into a seat on Engine
243, shrugging into the harness of his 7-pound oxygen tank as the
truck raced through the darkness.</TE>
<TE>   A block from the house, Delatorre could see flames leaping from
windows. Smoke was going to be everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   A fire lieutenant met the engine and briefed Delatorre: A woman
and a child were in a rear bedroom. No one knew what kind of shape
they were in, but it couldn't be good.</TE>
<TE>   From the time he was a boy, Delatorre had always wanted to be a
firefighter. It was a rush, a thrill. That had never changed, even
after eight years.</TE>
<TE>   He knew what had to be done. He had practiced the drill, pulling
plastic dummies out of smoke-filled buildings with instructors
watching.</TE>
<TE>   This was the first time it was for real.</TE>
<TE>   Adrenaline pumping, Delatorre adjusted his hood, put on his air
mask, helmet and gloves, and forced open the front door.</TE>
<TE>   A furnace-like blast hit him. Flames cascaded down the stairs, and
a fireball flew over his head.</TE>
<TE>   The smoke was so dense that at first Delatorre was almost blind.
He could barely make out the first stair.</TE>
<TE>   Getting down on hands and knees to avoid the worst of the heat, he
put his left hand against the wall and crawled forward.</TE>
<TE>   Like all firefighters, he dreaded becoming lost and wandering
aimlessly in the deadly smoke. If he had to retreat, he could turn
around and use his right hand against the wall to guide him out.</TE>
<TE>   Flames were shooting along the ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's go! Let's go!" he yelled to firefighter Andy Veath, behind
him on the dark stairs. "We've got people trapped."</TE>
<TE>   Veath, a firefighter for a decade, had once saved an 18-month-old
girl from choking. He kept her photo on his desk.</TE>
<TE>   Now he was moving so quickly that part of his air pack got tangled
with his left glove, and he ran in with one hand bare. He touched
something hot -- very hot -- and he winced as he moved up the stairs
with Delatorre.</TE>
<TE>   At the top, they turned left and crawled down the hall.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone here?" Delatorre called. "Anyone here?!"</TE>
<TE>   He held his breath because exhaling in his mask made a spooky,
Darth Vader-like noise that could drown out cries for help.</TE>
<TE>   But there were no cries -- just each other's voices and background
chatter from their two-way radios.</TE>
<TE>   He turned into the bedroom, felt a bed and reached under it.
Nothing.</TE>
<TE>   He crawled over it and felt a limp torso. A woman, face down.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got somebody here," he shouted. He was fairly sure that she
was already dead.</TE>
<TE>   Veath followed. "I have a child," he called out.</TE>
<TE>   Delatorre grabbed the woman in a bear hug from behind, but her
loose clothing made her hard to hold. As she flopped like a noodle,
her arms flailed at him, knocking his helmet off and dislodging his
mask.</TE>
<TE>   Veath thought that the child in his arms was probably dead too.
But he wasn't sure -- and if the kid were to have any chance, he had
to get him out of this smoke.</TE>
<TE>   He saw a firefighter at the window.</TE>
<TE>   "Back off," Veath bellowed. "I need to break some glass."</TE>
<TE>   He smashed the window of the back bedroom with his left arm while
cradling the limp body with his right, then passed the child, a boy,
out to the firefighter on a ladder.</TE>
<TE>   Quickly, Veath rejoined Delatorre, who now had gritty smoke
seeping into his mask. Joined by a third firefighter, Scott Mohr,
they dragged the woman into the hall, down the stairs and out the
front door.</TE>
<TE>   Veysey hovered as his wife and son, both motionless, were carried
to the ambulances.</TE>
<TE>   Steam rose from Deserie Veysey's body. Her face was streaked with
soot. Rescuers weren't sure if she was breathing.</TE>
<TE>   Little John, just 3 1/2, was breathing, but at a labored pace, far
too slowly, as if he were losing the fight for survival. Specks of
glass glittered on his face in the harsh light of the ambulance.</TE>
<TE>   Veath put a laryngoscope, an L-shaped flashlight, into the boy's
mouth, shining a light down his throat. He tried to insert a narrow
tube to keep his air passage open, but he couldn't see the vocal
cords and was afraid to push deeper.</TE>
<TE>   Veath withdrew the tube. It was caked with soot.</TE>
<TE>   He cleaned the tube and tried again. Again it came up black.</TE>
<TE>   Veath knew that the poisons carried on the smoke were already
thick in the blood of the woman and the boy.</TE>
<TE>   They needed to get to a hospital fast.</TE>
<TE>   "Load and go!" he shouted.</TE>
<TE>   The ambulances rushed off into the night, sirens wailing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hours later, Deserie Veysey lay unconscious, face ashen, hair
matted, as her distraught mother leaned over her hospital bed.</TE>
<TE>   Tubes inserted to help her breathe had taken on the inky color of
the smoke. The sight had hit Irene Beetle so hard that as she
approached her 29-year-old daughter, her knees had buckled.</TE>
<TE>   Unable to reach over the tubes, she kissed her own hand and gently
placed it on Deserie's forehead.</TE>
<TE>   "I love you," she whispered.</TE>
<TE>   There was little more she could do. She thought of her grandchild,
Little John -- Deserie's stepson -- who also had been trapped in the
fire.</TE>
<TE>   She rushed down the corridor to see him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was shortly afterward that Det. Ron Delelio arrived at the Cary
police station, a Tudor-style building that looks like a cozy inn in
the English countryside.</TE>
<TE>   He got a verbal report from an officer who had photographed the
fire scene. Right away, it struck Delelio as odd.</TE>
<TE>   The husband, the officer said, told him that he had escaped the
smoke and flames by hurling himself through a second-story bedroom
window, then had run with his baby daughter, Sabrina, in his arms to
call for help. He left her with neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   But he had left his wife and son inside.</TE>
<TE>   What kind of man would leave his family to fend for themselves in
a fire -- even to call 911?</TE>
<TE>   Delelio thought of his own wife and baby daughter. He tried to
imagine himself doing that. Impossible. It would never happen.</TE>
<TE>   Delelio drove to the firehouse. A preliminary report from the
state fire marshal's office was already in: The blaze appeared to be
an accident. It had apparently started in the Christmas tree.</TE>
<TE>   That was plausible. It was mid-January and by now the tree would
have been tinder-dry. The spot near where the tree had been standing
was the most charred part of the room.</TE>
<TE>   Delelio seized a string of Christmas tree lights to be sent for
testing. Maybe it was faulty wiring. But he doubted that was the
cause. He couldn't get that image of a man abandoning his family out
of his mind.</TE>
<TE>   As he headed back to the police station, Delelio got word: Come
back to the firehouse. The fire chief had just received a call from
someone who wasn't buying the story either.</TE>
<TE>   The caller, Betty DeBruyne, lived in nearby Hainesville. Her
daughter, Patricia, had once been married to John Veysey. Patricia
had died in 1995. The coroner had ruled it cardiac arrhythmia, due to
a congenital heart problem.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, though, Betty DeBruyne and her husband, Gerald,
had grown increasingly suspicious of their onetime son-in-law.</TE>
<TE>   This wasn't Veysey's first fire, she said.</TE>
<TE>   His home in Twin Lakes, Wis., had burned. After it was rebuilt, a
gas explosion had blown the house to splinters.</TE>
<TE>   A Veysey home in Galena, Ill., had gone up in flames as well.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't take this lightly," she warned. "He's had too many fires."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   How This Series Was Reported</TE>
<TE>   The story of the investigation into John T. Veysey III is based on
interviews with numerous officials, including Pat Layng and Lori
Lightfoot of the U.S. Attorney's office in Chicago; members of the
Cary, Ill., police, including Chief Ron Delelio, Deputy Chief Ed
Fetzer and former Det. Denise Bradstreet; Cary firefighters Brad
Dellatore, Andy Veath, Scott Mohr and Robert Deau; U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Agents Jack Malooly, Tina Sherrow, Jane
Balkema and Jim Allison; Deserie Beetle and her mother, Irene Beetle;
Betty and Gerald DeBruyne, and Kathleen "Callie" Hilkin.</TE>
<TE>   It also draws on thousands of pages of court testimony, as well as
a transcript of an interview with Veysey conducted by Sherrow and
John Korth, a sheriff's deputy in Jo Daviess County, Ill. Through his
attorney, Veysey declined to be interviewed.</TE>

<LD>War status -- The review of "Reagan's War" in the Oct. 20 Book Review
stated that Lew Ayres was a conscientious objector in Oregon during
World War II. In fact, Ayres, in addition to being a conscientious
objector in Oregon, served as an Army medic and chaplain's assistant
in the Pacific during WWII. Also, the review incorrectly stated that
Jane Wyman was married to Lew Ayres. Wyman was never married to
Ayres.</LD>

<HD>Writing his way out of his father's shadow</HD>
<DH>Collected Novels and Plays, James Merrill, Edited by J.D.
McClatchy and Stephen Yenser, Alfred A. Knopf: 678 pp., $40</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Caroline Fraser</AU>
<BD>Caroline Fraser is a frequent contributor to the New
York Review of Books, among other publications.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before he was a poet, before he had written any of the works that
made his reputation, James Merrill was the son of Charles Edward
Merrill, one of the most influential and inventive stockbrokers of
all time, a man who predicted the stock market crash of 1929.
Merrill's relationship with his famous father -- and everything
represented by him -- animates much of the material in "Collected
Novels and Plays," the second volume in a series edited by J.D.
McClatchy and Stephen Yenser. (Merrill's "Collected Poems" was
published last year; a "Collected Prose and Letters" will follow).
Aside from their inherent interest -- Merrill rarely wrote a dull
word -- these fictions, particularly the autobiographical novel "The
Seraglio," mark a dramatic phase in his development as a writer,
providing -- oddly enough -- perhaps the most accessible introduction
to Merrill's poetry, known for its obscurity. It was here, rather
than in his earliest poetry, that Merrill acted out his first
transforming struggle with the conditions that defined his life:
wealth, class and homosexuality.</LD>
<TE>   Although he died in 1956, Charlie "Good Time" Merrill, the
self-made founder of Merrill Lynch, has had and continues to have an
enormous effect on the lives of average Americans. Foreseeing the
importance of chain stores -- underwriting and ultimately controlling
the S.S. Kresge Co. (now Kmart) and the Safeway grocery chain --
Charlie Merrill also revolutionized the brokerage and investment
industry, moving it away from the clubby elitist bankers' enclave
that it once was and toward the free-wheeling free enterprise system
-- open to the humblest investor -- that it now is. Whether they know
it or not, millions of middle-class Americans anxiously watching the
stock market are following the path laid out for them by Charlie
Merrill. And whether Merrill Lynch knows it or not, it owed the good
name and consumer trust it recently squandered in
conflict-of-interest scandals to its founder, whose horror at what
has become of the company he built can only be imagined.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Merrill's origins were modest. Born in 1885 to a country
physician in Florida, he worked his way through Amherst College and
headed the bond department of a New York firm before founding his own
company in 1914, making his first fortune not long after. He had two
children by his first wife; his second, Hellen Ingram, bore his third
and last child, James Ingram Merrill, in 1926. By that time, the
Merrills were living the life of New York's captains of finance,
dividing their time between a townhouse in Greenwich Village
(immortalized in Merrill's poem, "18 West 11th Street") and two homes
in Southampton.</TE>
<TE>   After his parents' acrimonious breakup when he was 12, James
struggled to come to terms with his father and the veritable force
field created by his narcissistic bluster and his scandal-ridden
private life (the "Good Time" nickname originated in salacious fact),
as well as his vast wealth and the hangers-on that it attracted. The
two novels in this volume track Merrill's journey from being the son
of a powerful man to being his own man: "The Seraglio," published in
1957, vividly captures Charlie Merrill's harem-style household while
announcing its author's emancipation from his family. "The (Diblos)
Notebook" of 1965 -- an experimental novel incorporating a novelist's
fits, starts and revisions -- carries us well into the life that
Merrill would lead in Greece and into its "pure aesthetic pleasure,"
the exploration of the possibilities of language, that would
characterize his later work.</TE>
<TE>   "The Seraglio," a fluent and assured debut from someone who had,
as yet, published only stiff early poems and an even stiffer play
("The Immortal Husband," also included in this volume), operates on
several levels, as a roman a clef about one of America's foremost
financial families, a witty Jamesian novel of innocents abroad and,
strangest of all, perhaps the only comic novel ever written featuring
the castration of its protagonist. That particular detail, of course,
was invented, but much of the novel was so close to life that it
created something of a sensation in its day, of which James Merrill
was inevitably reminded, he wrote in a later preface, "whenever I
encounter -- it still happens now and then -- some old party
connected with the Firm, who tells me with a knowing twinkle that he
read 'The Seraglio' hot off the press. I twinkle back, biting my
tongue not to say, 'Indeed? And what business was it of yours?' "</TE>
<TE>   In the novel, Merrill Lynch becomes Tanning, Burr, or, simply, the
Firm; Merrill's father, Benjamin Tanning; his delicate, socially
correct half-sister (Doris Merrill Magowan), Enid Buchanan; and her
gruff, irascible husband (Robert Magowan, who would become president
and chairman of Safeway), Larry Buchanan. Merrill himself is rendered
as Francis: young, sexually confused and benumbed to his own
feelings.</TE>
<TE>   It opens with the re-creation of an actual event, the mysterious
knife slashing in the early 1950s of an oil portrait of Doris
Magowan. Here, however, the slasher, "the little murderess," is Lily,
Enid Buchanan's 9-year-old daughter, "in full revolt," as Francis
himself will ultimately be, against her family's concern with
appearances. Armed with a paper knife and a child's dreamy
unconscious fascination with destruction, Lily traces her mother's
features in the portrait, only to see the knife chip and then
penetrate the image:</TE>
<TE>   "She wouldn't have dreamed this face could be so fragile.
Experimentally she touched the point of the knife to the same spot; a
second, larger flake of paint fell off, exposing the dead white
canvas. She had now a sense of fatigue. It was becoming such a slow,
complicated process, not like the shattering of an ornament. And
beyond repair. That fragment of a face could no more be put back than
could the daisy petal pulled to see whether you were loved or not
....The knife with a will of its own pierced the canvas and tore
briskly downwards five or six inches before she succeeded in letting
go."</TE>
<TE>   Francis, on a European tour as the novel opens, longs to perform a
similar kind of reconstruction on his father. First he contracts with
Xenia, a louche European sculptress (a portrait of Guitou Knoop, who
was hired by Merrill to do busts of his father and one of his
nephews), to interpret the old man, as well as his niece, Lily,
establishing the leitmotif of the novel: art's power to strip away
superficiality and reveal fundamental truths. As soon as he returns
from Europe, Francis visits his brother-in-law at the Firm and
demands to be cut off from the family money:</TE>
<TE>   "What I mean is, I don't want the power that goes with money. It's
a crippling power; whoever uses it is at the mercy of it. No freedom
goes with it. One's forever being watched and plotted against, or
else protected from the very things that don't do harm! One's never
in a position to find out what's real and what isn't -- with the
result that nothing's real, nothing in the whole world is real!"</TE>
<TE>   But the family's wealth is not the only barrier separating Francis
from "what's real." His sexuality truly puts him at odds with the
world's, and his family's, fondest expectations. Although the novel
is hardly explicit on this score (it was 1957), it's nonetheless
obvious to the reader that Francis -- in renouncing "the dark side of
love, the whole degrading panicky sexual side" -- actually hopes to
renounce homosexuality and his parents' accompanying disappointment:
"What Benjamin ... [wanted] was to see his son behave as men did
behave with a pretty woman ....This Francis knew he had never learned
to do." So Francis, quite literally, makes himself a eunuch in his
father's house of love.</TE>
<TE>   In his later preface, Merrill wrote: "Friends who read the book in
manuscript begged me to reconsider the episode of Francis'
self-mutilation. I was too pleased by its neat 'objective
correlative' for my quarrel with the prevailing social and sexual
assumptions to listen to reason. Freely granting its Grand Guignol
aspect, I'll stand by the scene to this day. The victim is after all
only a character in a book."</TE>
<TE>   Not quite. The real, the intended victims were Merrill's parents,
doubtless mortified by such a graphic violation of social propriety.
In essence, their son held up a mirror to them, saying, "Is this
really who you want to be? Who you want me to be?" In the novel,
Merrill describes his father's highhandedness ("Whatever he decided
to serve -- whether caviar or humble pie -- the victim was meant to
choke it down and be grateful. Nobody had ever had a chance to refuse
the brutal bounty.") and neatly hands it back to him in a package
that constitutes a "brutal bounty" of its own. "The book at that
level," its author later acknowledged, "remains a callow act of
self-assertion hardly called for in view of the love and tact I had
always been shown by my family."</TE>
<TE>   Although loving, however, Merrill's parents were not always
tactful. In his memoir, "A Different Person," Merrill recalls their
horror at and rejection of his sexuality, tensions that would echo
through his later work. Callow or not, the act of writing "The
Seraglio" may have been an essential act of separation -- albeit less
drastic than Francis' own -- that Merrill's subsequent life and
career would depend on.</TE>
<TE>   In her recent memoir of her friendship with Merrill and his
longtime partner, David Jackson, novelist Alison Lurie remarked on
how total that separation was: "Over the many years [Merrill and
Jackson] were together, they lived in attractive but in no way grand
houses .... They traveled a lot; but they dressed simply, drove
small, inexpensive cars, and did their own shopping and cooking. The
only servant they ever had was a cleaning lady. Throughout his life
Jimmy spent only a fraction of his income. Much of it went to a
nonprofit organization he had set up called the Ingram Merrill
Foundation ... [that] gave grants to writers, artists, and
musicians.... My guess is that no one will ever know the extent of
their generosity, which tended to be secret -- but which often
changed lives...."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, despite the pointed satire of his station and class that
Merrill achieved in "The Seraglio," despite his lifelong dedication
to art, more unwarranted ad hominem nonsense has been written about
him than about virtually any other American poet. In 1991, memoirist
Mary Karr in the literary magazine Parnassus accused him of
"emotional vacuity" and derided his "chief talent ... his mastery of
elegant language." More recently, an essay by Adam Kirsch in The New
Republic allows for his "achievement" while dismissing his work as
"decadent" and "superficial ... profoundly concerned with surfaces."
"It is easy," Kirsch writes, "to see why Merrill has often been
dismissed as a merely decorative poet, an aesthete playing with
form." Such charges seem to Kirsch "all the more credible because of
[Merrill's] great wealth: In the old American contest between
paleface and redskin, Merrill's money and status place him firmly in
the first camp." Those sensitive to language should recognize words
such as "elegant," "decadent" and "aesthete" for what they are:
barely disguised code defaming Merrill's homosexuality and wealth.</TE>
<TE>   To anyone familiar with Merrill's true achievement, beginning with
the separation acted out in "The Seraglio," the injustice of such
slurs is clear. Producing a body of work that stands in contrast to
the life of ease and leisure that he could have had, Merrill was
every bit as industrious as his extraordinary father, but the
treasure he laid up, as represented in these collected editions, may
well outlast all the lucre that Merrill Lynch could ever amass. His
greatest work, his poems, plumbs the depths of elemental feeling:
love, sexual ecstasy and humiliation, jealousy, self-doubt,
disappointment, loneliness, and the pain of losing friends and lovers
to death. These are the subjects of all great lyric poetry, and they
are indisputably Merrill's subjects. The only superficial aspect
regarding his work has been, too often, the criticism of it.</TE>

<HD>Losing her head, losing her heart</HD>
<DH>Quentins, A Novel, Maeve Binchy, Dutton: 352 pp., $25.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Harris</AU>
<BD>Michael Harris is a regular contributor to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maeve Binchy's career is proof that an internationally bestselling
novelist needn't have the full arsenal of fiction writing skills.
What she does need is the shrewdness to stick to her strengths, which
in Binchy's case are sure-handed plotting and a feel for the foibles
and dreams of ordinary Irish people.</LD>
<LD>   The heroine of "Quentins," Ella Brady, is a sensible young Dublin
woman who has a blind spot: She doesn't realize that the married man
she loves, Don Richardson, is not only trifling with her affections
but defrauding investors, including Ella's parents, of their savings.
When Don flees to Spain, leaving behind a computer with his financial
records, Ella doesn't give it to the police.</LD>
<LD>   Though her friends urge her to do just that, she feels it would be
wrong, somehow, to incriminate a man she loved. Besides, Ella feels
that Don will want the computer back. He will take risks to get it --
and isn't that the same, almost, as declaring that he still loves
her?</LD>
<TE>   A writer less assured than Binchy wouldn't let Ella remain deluded
so long. She would fear that such a character couldn't keep our
sympathy. But Binchy knows that it's human to lose our heads along
with our hearts and that Ella's blind spot doesn't prevent her from
being smart and savvy in other contexts.</TE>
<TE>   To help make up for her parents' losses, Ella takes a job with a
fledgling film company that aims to document "the growth in Irish
self-confidence" in the last 40 years by focusing on a restaurant,
Quentins, which has evolved from a greasy spoon "full of people with
suitcases tied with string come in for tea and a couple of fried eggs
before they took the emigrant ship" into one of Dublin's finest
eateries.</TE>
<TE>   This allows Binchy to piggyback a number of other stories into the
main story of Ella and Don: the story of Quentin, the restaurant's
gentle, reclusive founder; the stories of Patrick and Brenda Brennan,
who manage the place; and the stories of waiters, customers and
friends. It's a strategy Binchy used in "Scarlet Feather," about a
couple who started a catering company. In fact, Cathy Scarlet and Tom
Feather also appear here, along with characters from "Evening Class"
and "Tara Road."</TE>
<TE>   On behalf of Firefly Films, Ella journeys to New York City to
solicit funding for the documentary from the King Foundation, whose
director, Derry King, seems like just the man to make her forget all
about Don, except that Derry, who had a drunken, abusive Irish
father, hates her country. Back in Dublin, Ella discovers that Don's
associates are indeed trying to get in touch with her. And she begins
to have second thoughts about the film. Isn't Quentins too special a
place to be exposed to the world's voyeuristic eyes, even with the
best of motives?</TE>
<TE>   Though the stories flow readily, Binchy's prose has no beauty to
it. Her dialogue is uneven. She can't describe anything so that it
takes vivid form in our minds. So she wisely doesn't try. She
minimizes description, like the pale washes in the background of a
watercolor.</TE>
<TE>   Nor does Binchy have -- and this is a strange thing to say of an
Irish writer -- any interest in politics and history. Hers is a world
of work and love alone, in which fulfillment belongs to individuals
or small groups of like-minded strivers. It's an optimistic world:
This is surely the secret of its appeal. Honest, cheerful,
hard-working people prevail; hypocrites get their comeuppance. Binchy
gives us just enough realism to convince us that her characters have
paid their dues before she relents and lets the good times roll.</TE>

<HD>All dressed up and no place to go</HD>
<DH>Uniforms: Why We Are What We Wear,  Paul Fussell,  Houghton
Mifflin: 204 pp., $22</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Adam Hochschild</AU>
<BD>Adam Hochschild is the author of "Finding the Trapdoor:
Essays, Portraits, Travels" and "King Leopold's Ghost."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As long as we humans have been wearing something other than the fur
of the last animal we killed, we've invested much pride and envy in
uniforms, official or unofficial. And, who knows, probably back then
we used to notice how big was the bearskin worn by the neighbor in
the next cave.</LD>
<LD>   My first brush with uniforms came when I was 15. I was on the
student council at a snooty New England boarding school. Feeling
ourselves bold heretics against conformity, a fellow student and I
argued against the requirement that boys wear coats and ties to
meals. We filibustered through four weeks of meetings and lost
soundly, 14 to 2.</LD>
<LD>   Often, people's first awareness of the politics of clothing has to
do with military uniforms. Would men have proudly marched off to
battle for so many centuries, and would crowds have cheered them on,
if they did so in baggy sweatsuits? Indeed, less than a decade after
my own heroic stand against coats and ties, I found myself a U.S.
Army private. Extremely worried that I might be sent to Vietnam, I
was nonetheless startled to find that I still rather liked wearing
the uniform. My unit was entitled to an extra badge or two, and I
made sure these frills were in place on my uniform before riding the
bus home on weekends. In taking on the subject of uniforms, Paul
Fussell has tackled something rich in possibilities.</LD>
<TE>   Someone once said of Edmund Wilson that he was so good a critic
that after reading him, you almost didn't need to read the books he
wrote about. If there is any living writer of whom one could say the
same, it's Fussell. At his best he is a passionate, insightful guide
to a wide range of intellectual territory. His "Abroad: British
Literary Traveling Between the Wars" is a fascinating analysis of an
entire literary genre and of what it reveals of the mood of its era.
"Wartime: Understanding and Behavior in the Second World War" shows
with equal brilliance how the "good war" to defeat fascism was as
filled as all other wars with needless suffering, massive
incompetence and a fog of sanitized upbeat news for the folks back
home. And his masterpiece, "The Great War and Modern Memory," will
still be read decades from now for its deconstruction of the tragic
gap between the myths believed by the British public and how World
War I was actually experienced by the men in the trenches. Like the
finest of imaginative literature, it's a book that contrasts illusion
and reality.</TE>
<TE>   I wish I could say something remotely similar of "Uniforms: Why We
Are What We Wear." But without Fussell's name on the cover, I
wouldn't have recognized it as his. It reads almost as if he had
merely jotted down his research notes and then lost interest. He
introduces the book by saying, "All my life I have had a thing about
uniforms." After a long, odd collection of facts about uniforms in
history, mostly in the 20th century, a final chapter starts with an
academic-journal cliche: "Uniforms have such mysterious effects on
both wearers and audiences that the subject deserves fuller inquiry."</TE>
<TE>   Fussell's tidbits range from the familiar (President Nixon's
short-lived attempt to dress White House police like Prussian
soldiers) to the quirkily interesting (when World War II veterans
want to be buried in uniform, the originals are often too small, and
there's a business that sells larger ones) to things that one might
scribble down on note cards (the craze for torn jeans) to see if they
could later be fitted into some pattern. But there is no pattern.
There are rambling paragraphs on uniforms in Czarist Russia, Nazi
Germany and Victorian Britain and on how those at the very top
sometimes signal their topness by sporting unusually fancy uniforms
(Goering, Patton) or unusually simple ones (MacArthur, Hitler).
Fussell also has strong personal feelings for and against various
types of U.S. military uniforms and graduation day hoods and gowns.
Uniforms, he says, can variously signify our need for belonging,
convey cleanliness and expertise (doctors' white coats) or stigmatize
(prisoners' stripes). So? Fuller inquiry is, alas, indeed needed.</TE>
<TE>   His strange last chapter is called "Notes Toward the Reader's Own
Theory of Uniforms." The very title seems to say: You figure it out.
It peters out into a string of titled subchapters, some only a
paragraph or two long, as if these are the dregs of his notebook.
There are notes on which of the various women's World War II military
uniforms lusty male soldiers found most difficult to remove, on
archaic "trade uniforms" (the printer's cap of folded newspaper, the
iceman's leather shoulder pad), on whether women find UPS or Federal
Express uniforms sexier and on sun helmets. Part of the problem is
that Fussell has focused on a single artifact which could be just one
of many prisms through which to look at a time and place. In the end,
what's most interesting is not the uniforms, but the cultures inside
them.</TE>
<TE>   I have no comprehensive theory of uniforms myself. But the passing
years have made me more relaxed about the whole business. Recently my
wife was given an honorary degree in Norway. Male attire for the
celebratory banquet was, the invitation said, "tail coats." I felt a
brief flash of the old teenage rebelliousness: a tail coat was even
worse than coats and ties. But I found a shop that rented tail coats.
As I approached, I saw its display window filled with a glorious
array of Santa Claus suits, Easter Bunny costumes, clown suits and
more. Suddenly I felt better and thought: We're all in uniform, all
the time, whether we're trying to stand out, blend in or conform.</TE>
<TE>   At the banquet that evening, it appeared that formal dress in
Scandinavia apparently means any kind of formal. Most men had tail
coats, but the local bishop wore a black robe and purple sash, and
the Swedish ambassador, in a 19th century diplomatic uniform, looked
like a Napoleonic general. Some men and women wore "national dress"
-- traditional black peasant costumes with white lace trim and
colorful cross-stitched designs. After dinner, a rock band played,
and everyone was twisting, twirling and jitterbugging. Whatever the
required uniforms for the occasion, they had all been transcended.
Uniforms do show something, but it's the people who wear them who
decide how seriously to take them.</TE>

<HD>Once upon a time ...</HD>
<DH>The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales, Edited and translated by
Maria Tatar, W.W. Norton: 446 pp., $35</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gerard Jones</AU>
<BD>Gerard Jones is the author of "Killing Monsters: Why
Children Need Fantasy, Super Heroes, and Make-Believe Violence."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Children learn lessons from the stories they read, said Jean-Jacques
Rousseau, but "when they are in a position to apply them, they almost
always do so in a way opposite to the author's intention." With tales
from the Brothers Grimm, Charles Perrault, Hans Christian Andersen,
Joseph Jacobs and others, Maria Tatar's "Annotated Classic Fairy
Tales" serves as a rich elaboration of that idea.</LD>
<LD>   Tatar's choice of stories is indeed "classic": nothing that would
not have been part of the basic nursery library of any educated
Western home at mid-century. But by entwining those
almost-too-familiar stories with historical notes, multiple
interpretations and illustrations by a variety of artists, she shows
not only how individuals but also societies, classes, eras and
bickering gaggles of scholars have drawn endlessly various meanings
from the same narratives. In the process she leads us to see that the
very search for "meaning" is a diminution of the mysterious and
contradictory powers of storytelling.</LD>
<TE>   Tatar is a folklorist and professor of Germanic languages at
Harvard, and most of her notes concern historical backgrounds or
parallels among folk traditions, but here and there she allows us a
Freudian, Jungian, Marxist or lit-critical interpretation. So, as we
explore even as simple a narrative as "Jack and the Beanstalk," we
can read it as a symbol of the end of the oral phase of early
childhood or of the British exploitation of the colonies, connect it
to the stories of Aladdin and the Buddha, and consider why Jacobs
chose to reject an earlier, more moralistic version and tell the
story as he did.</TE>
<TE>   The accompanying illustrations help us experience the story
simultaneously as dreamy idyll (Maxfield Parrish), rustic humor
(Arthur Rackham) and frightening adventure (an anonymous Victorian
who took his giants quite seriously). And we can engage with our
children, as Tatar suggests, in questioning whether Jack was a hero
whose slaying of the giant and liberation of his property was
justified or if he was really just a very bad boy.</TE>
<TE>   Tatar demonstrates that efforts to reduce such narratives to
ethical how-to manuals for the preschool set are nothing new. The
Grimms' first collection was assailed by 19th century audiences as
"tasteless" and full of material "unsuitable for children," and so in
their second edition the brothers added moral messages and rewrote
everything that could be seen as troubling to parents. At the time
that meant mainly sexual references: their first version of
"Rapunzel" outed the long-tressed heroine when she asked the
enchanted warden of her tower why her clothes no longer fit after her
lover knocked her up; the slip of the lip that has betrayed her in
every telling of the story for the last 180 years ("Why are you so
much heavier than the king's son?") was a Grimm invention. (The shift
in parental jitters over the last two centuries can be measured by
the fact that, while cleaning up the sex, the Grimms exaggerated the
violence and gore, apparently feeling that horror would drive the
moral points home more vividly for children.)</TE>
<TE>   More recently, cultural conservatives such as William J. Bennett
have tried to hijack the stories for the promotion of their simple
ethical templates, an effort that Tatar dismisses as "mindless." The
author of "The Book of Virtues," she says, "fails to recognize the
complexities of reading, the degree to which children ... become
passionate about vices as well as virtues." What fascinates in these
tales are not the acts and consequences that proceed to happy endings
but the transformations, killings, abandonments, agonies and sudden
boons on the twisting forest paths along the way.</TE>
<TE>   Tatar thus allies herself more with Bruno Bettelheim, who argued
in "The Uses of Enchantment" that the violence and horror of fairy
tales can be therapeutic for children. But even he fell prey to the
reductionism that seduces anyone who tries to make the stories serve
a "use." "Goldilocks and the Three Bears," he fretted, failed to
provide the "promise of future happiness awaiting those who have
mastered their oedipal situation as a child."</TE>
<TE>   Tatar's comment is a bit decorous: "Bettelheim's reading is
perhaps too invested in instrumentalizing fairy tales," but simply by
placing the quote against the suspense and delight of that naughty
little girl's narrow escape from the consequences of poking around
where she shouldn't, she exposes even that psychoanalyst as a prig
who couldn't quite bear to let a child pursue the lure of fantasy off
the predetermined path.</TE>
<TE>   Tatar makes clear, however, that the eternal warfare between the
tales and their interpreters is not one between folk purity and
educated folly. The biographical sketches at the back of the book
emphasize the extent to which these fairy tales are the works of
individual authors. Andersen openly invented his own stories.
Perrault reworked peasant tales into parables for the aristocrats of
Versailles. Even the Grimm brothers, while insisting that their
intention was to record folk literature, relied extensively on
literary sources and rewrote their stories progressively over many
editions.</TE>
<TE>   Nor were the yarns as we know them spun by cultural insiders:
Andersen was a social outcast whose work was generally disdained in
his native Denmark until long after he'd achieved fame abroad;
Jacobs, the first great collector of English fairy tales, was an
Australian Jew who taught in New York; the Grimms' principal source
was Dorothea Viehmann, no peasant crone from the Schwarzwald but the
daughter of an innkeeper of French Huguenot descent -- an outsider to
every nation, raised on polyglot travelers' tales.</TE>
<TE>   These authors' versions of the tales became "classic" because of
the universalism, prettiness and sense of an authorial voice that
they bring to what would otherwise be rustic peculiarities.</TE>
<TE>   In an appendix, Tatar gives us the opportunity to read a genuine
folk version of "Little Red Riding Hood" called "The Story of
Grandmother." As a contrast, it's illuminating: The girl is not
devoured and freed from the wolf's death belly by a paternal savior
but slips away by pretending she needs to relieve herself. As a
story, however, it strikes the modern reader as ill-proportioned,
slight and good for little but a drunken chuckle around the bonfire.
It was the reworking of such folk tales by urbane authors that
created the mesmerizing and eternal "fairy tales."</TE>
<TE>   "The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales" is itself a bit of a frog
prince. The stories are lovely, most of them retranslated by Tatar
with a sensitive inflection toward being read aloud; but the marginal
notes tease us repeatedly out of their spell, while never coalescing
into a coherent narrative.</TE>
<TE>   The illustrations are too small and redundant to serve as
evocative visual partners to the narrative (especially if one
imagines holding up the page to show a child); nor are they
systematic enough to guide us intellectually. While the tales derive
mainly from the 17th to the mid-19th century, when the rude facts of
peasant life were still vivid to most Europeans, the illustrations
are drawn from the industrialized Europe of the late 19th and early
20th centuries--pre-Raphaelite, Art Nouveau, Neo-Gothic--reinventing
old Europe as (in Edward Burne-Jones' phrase) "a beautiful romantic
dream ... a land no one can define, or remember, only desire."</TE>
<TE>   At times the anthology feels more like a scrapbook, but maybe
that's how it should be: The almost random smattering of images and
diversity of notes suggest many unfollowed paths of interpretation,
reminding us of Tatar's central argument that each story is many
things at once.</TE>
<TE>   Tatar ("The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales") has shown that
she can mount a coherent folkloric investigation. Here she chooses
not to do so, suggesting even that too much coherence diminishes the
tales. Here she scatters information like bread crumbs in the forest,
which might lead us back to familiar territory or might be carried
willy-nilly by birds of thought to unsuspected adventures in the
forest of stories.</TE>

<LD>Eloise Takes a Bawth, Kay Thompson with "additional plumbing" by Mart
Crowley, Illustrated by Hilary Knight, Simon &amp; Schuster: 80 pp.,
$17.95</LD>
<LD>   Ever-irrepressible Eloise absolutely loves taking a bawth, and her
devotees will absolutely love seeing her "splawsh, splawsh, splawsh"
her way through a delightfully disastrous -- yet ultimately
propitious -- time in the tub. "You have to be absolutely careful
when you take a bawth in a hotel," announces the famous
Plaza-dweller, who ignores her own advice and turns on all the
faucets ("Let that water gush out and slush out into that sweet old
tub tub tub and fill it up to the absolutely top of its brim so that
it can slip over its rim onto the floor if it wants to").</LD>
<TE>   A judicious use of blue on Hilary Knight's trademark pen-and-inks
traces the flow of water as it seeps from the penthouse through the
floors of the Plaza into the grand ballroom, where workers feverishly
prepare for the Venetian Masked Ball. Featuring two gatefold spreads,
Knight's drolly detailed pictures depict the hotel's startled guests
and employees as water gushes from such unexpected sources as
elevator buttons and chandeliers. Oblivious Eloise, meanwhile,
blissfully imagines herself driving a speedboat full throttle, water
skiing and battling pirates in the Caribbean. A postscript explains
that Kay Thompson and Knight collaborated on this book 40 years ago,
and it has been brought to light with the help of playwright Mart
Crowley. Since the buoyant art and humorously bubbly text surely rise
to the level of its precursors, it's high time this book appeared,
"for Lord's sake," as Eloise herself might say. (Ages 5 and older)</TE>

<TE>   Tribes, Arthur Slade, Wendy Lamb Books/Random House: 160 pp.,
$15.95</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Slade's ("Dust") dense novel inventively uses an
anthropological lens to view high school life. The narrator,
17-year-old Percy, explains in a prologue that his anthropologist
father died in the Congo three years earlier, after being bitten by a
tsetse fly. The teen then reveals that on the night his father died,
"Dad materialized at my bedside, extended a ghost arm, and opened his
fingers to reveal a pair of glowing spirit eyes and inserted the
magical orbs into my sockets." Percy thereafter refers to fellow
humans as "hominids" and frequently relies on amusing anthropological
jargon that occasionally grows grating. Yet the narrative effectively
conveys why Percy is shunned by fellow students. His most astute
observations come at the expense of his peers: "Numerous tribes exist
in friction at our school. The Logo Tribe exhibits name brands
wherever and whenever possible. The Lipstick/Hairspray Tribe performs
elaborate appearance alterations to attract mates."</TE>
<TE>   Other highlights include a mystical parallel with the Ndebele
tribe, with whom his father was working at the time of Percy's birth,
and the tribe's ritual marking a boy's entry into manhood. Despite
the hero's awkward anthropologic-speak ("No one ever knows what I'm
talking about. What it means. No one!"), readers who admire the
fellow's spirit may well enjoy this unusual treatise on high school
culture; a concluding twist brings this tale down to Earth. (Ages 12
and older)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Be Boy Buzz, bell hooks, Illustrated by Chris Raschka, Jump at the
Sun/Hyperion: 32 pp., $16.99</TE>
<TE>   This stunning volume celebrates all things boy. The creators of
"Happy to Be Nappy" set the stage with a bold opening sortie: "I be
boy" appears on the left of the spread, paired with a deceptively
simple layering of rectangles in blue line that pulsates on the page;
opposite, a thoughtful-looking fellow, all elbows and knees slightly
bent, seems poised for action.</TE>
<TE>   This spare, poetic riff on young manhood plumbs the delights and
contradictions of what it means to be a boy, particularly an African
American boy, in a brief handful of sentences and a few well-placed
pastel lines that imply motion and emotion. From boys soaring ("All
bliss boy") to boys sulking ("All bad boy beast"), at play ("I be boy
jumping") and at rest ("all think and dream time"), the words
pinpoint boyhood's unflagging energy and exuberance, vulnerability
("Hug me close. Don't let me down.") and attitude.</TE>
<TE>   bell hooks' rhythmic blend of brevity and eloquence launches Chris
Raschka's trademark visual haiku. His series of watercolor and pastel
portraits set off against a warm cappuccino backdrop conjures fingers
and toes, features and squiggles of hair from simple sweeps of his
brush, evoking characters suffused with humanity and tenderness. This
life-affirming book will have readers as much "in love with being a
boy" as are its own utterly irresistible characters. (Ages 4-8)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Silly &amp; Sillier: Read-Aloud Tales From Around the World, Judy
Sierra, Illustrated by Valeri Gorbachev, Alfred A. Knopf: 96 pp.,
$19.95</TE>
<TE>   In this spirited collection, reteller Judy Sierra ("Nursery Tales
Around the World" and its sequel, "Can You Guess My Name?:
Traditional Tales Around the World,") once again rounds up a bevy of
brief, traditional tales. Here, 20 stories from countries as diverse
as Bangladesh, Borneo, Mexico and the Czech Republic range from some
that will be entirely new to youngsters to riffs on familiar yarns
(among them a Russian variation on the tale of a mitten that expands
to shelter woodland animals and a cumulative Irish tale with a
refrain akin to that of "The Gingerbread Man").</TE>
<TE>   In the volume's funniest offering, "Juan Bobo" from Argentina, a
simpleton inadvertently wins the hand of a princess. Valeri Gorbachev
("Nicky and the Big, Bad Wolves") utilizes her signature renderings
of animals endowed with bold personalities to great effect here.
Vignettes build the tension in "The Wonderful Pancake" as various
pursuers join the fray, while a two-thirds-page spot illustration
captures the climactic moment when "Bear Squash-You-All-Flat" bursts
the mitten in the Russian story. Though several selections seem a bit
slight, well-timed repetition, alliteration, sound effects and
copious dialogue from a variety of characters make most of the
stories lively choices for reading aloud. Gorbachev's illustrations
reflect the international settings and reinforce the playfulness of
the tales. (Ages 5-8)*</TE>

<HD>A clay that shapes the potter</HD>
<DH>The Cave, A Novel, Jose Saramago, Translated from the
Portuguese, by Margaret Jull Costa, Harcourt: 308 pp., $25</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's often been suggested how alike God and the novelist are,
especially by people who believe in the novel and don't believe in
God. The Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago particularly invites the
comparison. It's not only that Saramago exhibits as a creator such a
miraculous combination of power and ease, that his air of enormous
wisdom coexists with a marked tetchiness or that he follows the
activities of his people with such pained concern. In "The Gospel
According to Jesus Christ" (1991), he made the rivalry explicit. His
Jesus of Nazareth emerges from this heretical novel as a more
complete and persuasive literary character than we get from the
evangelists. Saramago writes of Jesus in a tone of loving
superiority; he describes the kid as a father might. And even as he
treats the earnest and decent, somewhat humorless carpenter's son as
a moral exemplar, he announces that "if another man's son had been
chosen, we are confident that whoever he was, he would have given us
just as much food for thought as Jesus."</LD>
<TE>   Saramago is always like this: generously sententious, warm and
wicked, royal in his tone, democratic in his affections. Theologians
used to refer to the condescension of God's becoming man -- and that
term does better than most to characterize Saramago's special way
with his characters. If such condescension sounds off-putting, then
it should be pointed out that Jane Austen has a similar manner. She
knows her heroines' frailties but also knows their desires before
they do and wants to see them gratified. By contrast, the God of "The
Gospel According to Jesus Christ" seeks his own glory over the
welfare of his followers. When Jesus asks God whether his sacrifice
will be the last that God requires, he is met with one of Saramago's
most astonishing passages: a nine-page catalog of divinely sanctioned
martyrdom and massacre.</TE>
<TE>   Saramago joined the Portuguese Communist Party in 1968 and remains
a Marxist to this day. What is remarkable is to read him and find
yourself rooting against religious fundamentalism and market
fundamentalism in something like the way that, reading "Pride and
Prejudice," you pray for Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy to get
married. Of course Saramago understands that politics and marriage
are not so simple. As his serious and unpopular politics confirm, the
grand old man (Saramago is 80 this year) is more than a mere vague
humanist. The atheist god of his created worlds, Saramago urges a
distinct creed.</TE>
<TE>   Cipriano Algor is a 64-year-old widower and potter threatened not
so much by mortality as by obsolescence. The jugs and vases he has
been making all his life no longer sell as before, and "The Cave"
begins as his contract with the Center -- a giant burgeoning
residential mall that dominates the landscape of his unnamed country
-- is abruptly terminated. As one character says in another Saramago
novel, "The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis," "This is the first
loneliness, to feel that we are useless." Cipriano sees no option but
to follow his daughter and son-in-law to the Center, where the
son-in-law works as a security guard (a growth industry, one gathers,
in this stratified society) and has hopes of being granted
residential status.</TE>
<TE>   Like "Blindness" and "All the Names," "The Cave" is an allegorical
novel alive through its details -- its mulberry tree and dog, its van
and potter's kiln -- but judiciously unspecific as to physiognomy and
place, so that the characters' faces and their city may be filled in
with the thought of our own. It is also more a love story and more
programmatically leftist than its predecessors. If the Center seems
too pat a symbol for the increasing identification of the marketplace
with human life, Saramago's feel for work and love are another thing.
His long fluid sentences, richly stocked with folk wisdom, swerve
through psychology and the physical world with equal assurance and
lend his novels a rare quality of permanence; it's as if only a story
confirmed in its shape many times before could be so confidently
told.</TE>
<TE>   Cipriano's daughter Marta proposes a final bid for economic
viability. Why not collaborate on a line of clay dolls? Maybe these
will find favor with the Center's resident-consumers. (Marta's other,
unannounced design is to make a match between her father and a young
widow named Estudiosa.) The molding and firing of a small raceof
figurines becomes not only a matter of private renewal but also a
metaphor for human self-creation, or the usurpation of God.
Saramago's symbolism is never of the Freudian kind, force-fed by the
unconscious. He is wry and openhanded about his meanings, and he
supplies them to his characters with typical warm generosity. The
initial work on the dolls he calls "the first day of creation," and
as Cipriano digs through the kiln for the first fired pieces, "the
ashes became hotter, but not enough to burn him, they were merely
warm, like human skin, and just as smooth and soft."</TE>
<TE>   The Algor household knows better than to imagine the Center will
vigorously retail the clay dolls; so does the reader. Meanwhile
Saramago spreads a cat's cradle of familial love between the points
of Cipriano, his daughter, her husband, their dog and the young
widow. We see what these characters ought to want; we see that,
except for the dog, with his canine clairvoyance, they mostly lack
this awareness themselves; and we don't know whether anyone will be
satisfied in the end. Saramago's work, like his potter's, arrives at
"the right shape, the precise line, the harmonious whole," and it
would be spoiling a good story to reveal the genuine horror the
Center ultimately throws open, or to say just how widow and widower
execute their tango. But when you've come to feel for Saramago's
people something of the affection they show one another, it's a shame
to have to admit that he provides them with too happy an ending.</TE>
<TE>   The Center is of course the cave of the title. It serves up
simulacra and virtual reality in place of experience. As with the
reigning economic model, it seems poised to attain such dominance
that nothing remains outside it. Marxism has a long-standing affinity
with Plato's parable of the cave (Saramago's epigraph comes from "The
Republic"). Plato held that behind the busy flux of phenomena there
existed a realm of changeless ideas. Yet most people mistook shadows
on the wall for all there was and supposed their cave was the world.
To Marx, the occluded reality was not one of pure ideas, but of labor
-- something that has never seemed truer than today, when producers
and consumers live so remote from one another and commodities appear
in the store or on the screen scoured clean of the history of their
production.</TE>
<TE>   Yet in art as in economics, a Marxist analysis is often cruelest
to Marxists themselves. In "The Cave," Saramago has leveraged
Cipriano's insight and ultimate rebellion on his work as a potter.
That is, Cipriano is an artisan, self-employed in a mode of
production steadily on the decline since the inception of capitalism.
The anthropologist David Graeber has argued that the movement against
corporate globalization, to which Saramago belongs, has drawn its
constituency from, on the one hand, students, intellectuals and
artists, and, on the other, indigenous peoples, because these are
groups not yet assimilated into the system of wage-labor.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the cave of corporate rule, if that's what it is, would have
to be abandoned by those who live there; the artisans and the
indigenous are too few to change things by themselves. One needn't be
a Marxist to sense about "The Cave" that Saramago, in his fondness
for his characters, has spared them the problem he means to
illustrate. This is especially so when the Algor family all leave the
Center -- for what? It's hard to frame an answer in the terms
Saramago sets out. Most readers will feel this as a certain
wishfulness or sentimentality: How nice to work with such
satisfaction and to escape with such ease.</TE>
<TE>   It could be that such a feeling will help bring us around to
Saramago's view that human society ought to become self-consciously
what it has always been -- not a product of the hand of God or "the
invisible hand," but human handiwork. This, in any case, is the
humble counterpart to Saramago's magnificent condescension: his
desire, movingly like that of his potter and his Christ, to be of
use.</TE>

<HD>The eminent misanthrope of Baltimore</HD>
<DH>The Skeptic: A Life of H.L. Mencken, Terry Teachout,
HarperCollins: 412 pp., $29.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brad Leithauser</AU>
<BD>Brad Leithauser is the author of numerous books,
including "Darlington's Fall: A Novel in Verse" and "The Odd Last
Thing She Did: Poems."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a small but engaging literary form, deserving of its own modest
library shelf: the biographies of curmudgeons. As a genre, it has its
own peculiar challenges and evaluative criteria. Its very creation is
likely to be haunted by a sense of self-generated menace, as the
biographer inevitably begins to wonder how the emerging portrait
might have stirred its subject's formidable wrath. If you undertake
to write the biography of, say, Jonathan Swift or Evelyn Waugh or
Kingsley Amis, you will be daily attended by a bilious ghost who
stands ready to dismiss all your painstaking efforts as the laborings
of a fool.</LD>
<LD>   H.L. Mencken, the subject of Terry Teachout's biography, was quick
to brand those who offended him fools but perhaps quicker still to
call them morons or idiots. Connoisseur of vituperation that he was,
Mencken was partial to condemnations that had an air of the rational
or scientific; words like "moron" or "idiot," with their whiff of
IQ-testing and lab assessments, carried a special appeal for him.
Mencken wanted his readers to understand that his denunciations were
not merely thoroughgoing and unqualified, they were also
dispassionate and verifiable.</LD>
<TE>   What would Mencken have made of Teachout's book? He would have had
to acknowledge, my guess is, that the writing is fluent and the
judgments fair-minded. Teachout's own career in many ways happily
reflects his subject's. Although Mencken, the literary man,
accomplished much (he wrote books about politics, religion,
philosophy and language) and aspired to far more (early on, he wished
to be a poet and a novelist), at heart he was a newspaperman, an
abiding loyalty understandable to Teachout, who worked for years on
the Kansas City Star and the New York Daily News and who is now
affiliated with Time, Commentary and the Washington Post. Mencken has
found an experienced and affinitive biographer.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Louis Mencken was born in 1880 in Baltimore, the son of a
prosperous cigar manufacturer who was himself born in Baltimore. The
family's ancestry was German, a fact that loomed large in Mencken's
mind from the onset of his career (he was a great one for
generalizing about national character traits) and that led him, in
his 50s, into deep journalistic follies and a stubborn purblindness
as Germany succumbed to the pandemic of Nazism. But however much
Europe may have preoccupied Mencken's thoughts, neither Berlin nor
Paris nor London rivaled the reality of Baltimore. Nor, for that
matter, could New York or Washington compete with his hometown. As an
adult, Mencken continued to reside in his childhood house; he spent
67 of his 75 years sheltered under its roof.</TE>
<TE>   Teachout refers to Mencken as "America's greatest journalist," a
plausible claim that ultimately acknowledges a spirited,
indefatigable triumph over numerous emotional and intellectual
shortcomings. An aura of improbability surrounds Mencken's whole
career. His limitations, as Teachout evenhandedly points out, were
multiple and severe. An autodidact whose formal schooling ended at
15, Mencken was a man of patchy education and broad but hardly
catholic interests. The entire modernist explosion in the arts, which
unfolded while he was still in mid-career, left him unmoved and
untouched. His views, political and aesthetic, were arrived at early
in his professional life, after which he remained largely impermeable
to new evidence or new persuasions. Although he coined the term Bible
Belt, he was ignorant of the South he habitually belittled, as he was
of most of the country lying beyond the Baltimore-New York axis of
his publishing efforts. He was -- a seemingly insuperable handicap
for a journalist -- mostly unobservant and incurious about the
hardships and deprivations and painfully postponed aspirations of the
working-class people who made up the bulk of his beloved Baltimore,
as they made up the bulk of that larger nation whose wayward passage
from isolationism to active participation in World War I, from
Prohibition to its repeal, from the paralysis of the Depression to
the frenzy of World War II so regularly incensed him.</TE>
<TE>   Yet from these very handicaps came some of his greatest strengths,
for Mencken more than most people embodied the idea of possessing the
virtues of one's vices. His deadened sympathy to the plight of the
poor was but one aspect of an otherwise frequently stimulating
misanthropy. If you believe, as Mencken did, that the human race is
"incurably idiotic," that "most people live and die as anonymously
and as nearly useless as so many bullfrogs or houseflies," it
naturally follows that their collective organizations -- their
political parties, their churches, their social clubs -- are all
guilty until proved innocent. There was little room in Mencken's
universe for respect rooted in tradition, consensus, custom or law,
with the overall result that his writings time and again pose a tonic
challenge to complacency. His favorite target was "the whole Puritan
scheme of things, with its gross and nauseating hypocrisies, its
idiotic theologies, its moral obsessions."</TE>
<TE>   And if most men are fools, it follows that in their
disappointments they are less deserving of commiseration than of
castigation: "It requires a conscious effort for me to pump up any
genuine sympathy for the downtrodden, and in the end I usually
conclude that they have their own follies and incapacities to thank
for their troubles." Yet hardhearted (to say nothing of wrongheaded)
as this viewpoint sounds, it was personally emancipating, insofar as
it allowed him to brandish his criticisms in the name of justice.
Mencken was perhaps a rarity among misanthropes in his profound
investment: in principles of fairness. It was of enormous importance
to him that his battles -- against numskulls, nincompoops and
boneheads -- not be exercises in mean-spiritedness. Always prone to
overstatement, Mencken exaggerated when he often boasted that he
adhered to no public code ("I am my own party"). The task of the
crusading writer was established and clear: not to be degraded or
corrupted by the foolishness around you. It was a point of honor to
avoid taking cheap shots, and Mencken longed, as much as he longed
for anything in the world, to be accounted an honorable man.</TE>
<TE>   The hopeless -- the irredeemable -- misanthrope might be defined
as somebody who can declare, "I was right, things have turned out
disastrously," and feel more pleasure in the first half of the
sentence than regret about the second. Mencken as he aged seemed to
slip further and further into this role. Certainly something went
awry for him in his final decades. His hatreds, especially of
Franklin D. Roosevelt, became hobbyhorses, and his later life seems
painfully illustrative of the notion that those who ride hobbyhorses
rarely get anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Some light was cast on the darkness of Mencken's later years with
the publication of "The Diary of H.L. Mencken" in 1989. (He had
arranged to have various private papers sealed until 33 years after
his death, which fell in 1956.) The diary disinterred various
uglinesses, particularly in his attitudes about Jews and blacks.
These were treated as revelations in the media and were roundly
condemned.</TE>
<TE>   But as Teachout points out, these were "revelations" only for the
uninformed or the amnesiac, since most had already been broadcast,
repeatedly, in Mencken's previously published work. Perhaps too much
has been written on the question of whether Mencken was a racist or
an anti-Semite; certainly too much has been written, by both
defenders and adversaries, seeking to prove him, in some absolute
way, either guilty or innocent. Better to suggest, as Teachout does,
that Mencken held a cluster of ill-thought-out attitudes, all too
common in their era, ranging from the disreputable to the despicable
-- and that he managed, even so, to find his closest friends among
Jews and to go out of his way, as an editor, to promote black
writers.</TE>
<TE>   The many outraged responses to the diary prompted a number of
notable authors, including Norman Mailer, Ralph Ellison, Arthur
Miller and John Hersey, to publish a collective letter in the New
York Review of Books protesting this critical "overreaction" and
reminding readers that Mencken was "a tremendous liberating force in
American culture." Theirs was a salutary gesture, and the hope is
that Teachout's book, in its lucid attempt to look both into and
beyond Mencken's personal failings, will also help refocus our
critical energies on Mencken, the "liberating force."</TE>
<TE>   I do wish -- my chief reservation about the biography -- that
Teachout had given equal attention to Mencken's writerly virtues. He
more than once makes the point that Mencken's significance is often
stylistic: a matter not of what he said but of how he said it. Yet
Mencken's achievement as a stylist is presented more or less as a
given. There isn't enough in "The Skeptic: A Life of H.L. Mencken"
about how all of Mencken's little linguistic felicities -- the
playful alliterations ("The artist must be allowed his impish
impulse"), the jarring metaphors ("to gild his lily until it shines
like a set of false teeth") -- combined to make Mencken's voice,
whatever his subject, so distinctive.</TE>
<TE>   Mencken's chief stylistic influence -- arguably, the chief
extra-familial influence on his life itself -- was Mark Twain.
Mencken's boyhood reading of "Huckleberry Finn" was a conversionary
experience. Its loving clash of dialects -- those rich, contending
American voices afloat on the great American river -- led in time to
Mencken's multi-volume magnum opus, "The American Language," and to a
prose style that injected into American belles-lettres the punch and
pungency of slang.</TE>
<TE>   What is perhaps most striking about Mencken's prose is that he,
unlike so many writers who espouse "everyday speech," did not
simplify his vocabulary or pare his clause-laden constructions: the
use of "low" language wasn't coupled with any talking down to his
audience. The result is that in Mencken's prose you're likely to
meet, cheek by jowl, constructions like "benign asses" and "brummagem
millenniums," "acerbitous" and "flubdub." (In choosing to pepper an
essentially rococo prose with colloquialisms, Mencken was a
forerunner to various later writers with whom he had little else in
common, including J.D. Salinger, Jean Stafford and John Cheever.)</TE>
<TE>   There's a lovely, even a redemptive, irony in Mencken's fondness
for slang. While he may have dismissed the "instinct of inferior men
to herd themselves in large masses" and railed away at the "middling,
dollar-grubbing, lodge joining, quack-ridden folk," he treasured the
fruits of their creativity, as expressed in the mostly anonymous
developments of their ever-evolving argot. To the man in the factory,
to the woman in the sweatshop, the literature to which Mencken
devoted his life was frequently off-limits. It wasn't for them -- the
creating of such books. No, often the only "literature" their
necessitous lives allowed was the coining of new expressions for old
laments -- the minting of all those ingenious, piquant, wry slang
terms that Mencken the stylist so eagerly pounced upon and
incorporated into his work. Hence, even while he was fulminating
against them, damning the morons and the idiots, Mencken was paying
them homage.</TE>

<HD>Passion, liberty, death: a song of Nicaragua</HD>
<DH>The Country Under My Skin: A Memoir of Love and War,
Gioconda Belli , Translated from the Spanish by Kristina Cordero,
Alfred A. Knopf: 386 pp., $25</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James LeMoyne</AU>
<BD>James LeMoyne, a former reporter for The New York
Times, covered Nicaragua in the 1980s.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are a few countries in the world that, through some seeming
magic beyond our normal senses, are able to enchant us despite their
utter misery and propensity to violence. For me -- and I suspect many
others who have been there -- Nicaragua is such a place. Dirty,
sweaty, seemingly cursed and wounded in many ways, this little land
is at the same time physically stunning and inhabited by people with
a strength of character, passion and humanity that washes over you
like a wave, engulfs you and, for those unable to resist that
seductive current, carries you away. I have spent some of the saddest
times of my life in the mountains and steaming coasts of Nicaragua
and some of the most beautiful.</LD>
<LD>   Reading Gioconda Belli's affecting memoir, "The Country Under My
Skin," brought all this back and more. In a way that is utterly
Nicaraguan, she recounts a true tale of passion, poetry,
insurrection, death and seeming liberation, followed by an ugly
ending that is mediated by a personal coda that is both salving and
humane. It is a hell of a story, recounting the fate of her country
and her self, told with tenderness, honesty and humor.</LD>
<TE>   Reading it also brought back just how mean and relentless the Cold
War was. Nicaragua and the Sandinistas fell into the final chapter of
that confrontation and were crushed by it. Nicaragua is struggling
still to recover from the toll inflicted by decades of dictatorship,
revolution and counterrevolution. But that is not the level at which
Belli tells her story. This is a much more personal account of taking
lovers and becoming an independent woman in a land of pure machismo
-- after marrying as an innocent bourgeois virgin at 18 in the Nejapa
Country Club. It is an account of having children and trying to be a
mother while becoming a revolutionary and a poet, of forced exile, of
mourning the loss of too many friends, of returning home only to find
further struggle and disappointment. In this unexpected life, the
final irony is that this Sandinista revolutionary poetess winds up
living in Santa Monica married to an American. It feels like an odd
but logical resolution to a life in which love ultimately proves
deeper and stronger than politics.</TE>
<TE>   Such frank humanity allows Belli to write tellingly of learning to
fire a gun and hating it. There are many Mata Hari episodes as she
secretly ferries senior Sandinista underground commanders around
Managua in the '70s while Anastasio Somoza still ruled. Later she
runs guns, carries secret documents and tens of thousands of dollars
in cash and turns her exile home in Costa Rica into a Sandinista
military training center and weapon depot while tending to her
children in the back room. She rises in the Sandinista ranks and
travels the world, meeting Cuban leader Fidel Castro, Panamanian
leader Gen. Omar Torrijos, Hanoi military commander Gen. Vo Nguyen
Giap and waging politics in Algeria, Libya and the former East
Germany and Soviet Union, among other destinations. Torrijos tries to
force her to bed and fails miserably. She is tailed and nearly
intercepted by Somoza's secret police, in the final encounter only
narrowly escaping while holding her pistol in her lap, prepared to
die shooting if captured. She falls hard for the head of the
Sandinista underground, who sleeps with a pistol, hand grenade and
his shoes on. And she mourns him achingly here as she looks at his
bullet-riddled body on the front pages after the National Guard
caught and killed him.</TE>
<TE>   Through it all she insists that she is first and foremost a woman
and a mother. She is compelling in recounting her sexual education
and the difference between love and passion. Her accounts of
womanhood, of giving birth and of motherhood are penetrating and
unflinchingly honest. "Without renouncing my femininity, I think I
have also managed to live like a man," she says convincingly. Her
story of nearly dying while giving birth to a premature son in a
dirty public hospital ward and being told that her baby boy was dead,
only to find later that he was alive, is a tear jerker. "Life never
surrenders," she writes, quoting a Vietnamese poem, expressing part
of the essence that makes Nicaragua and Nicaraguans so affecting and
such survivors of suffering that would break most of us.</TE>
<TE>   Belli is also a pretty straight shooter on matters political. She
is honestly self-critical on the failings of the Sandinistas that
contributed to their downfall -- their naivete, arrogance, extremism,
corruption and the inability to find a working synthesis between
revolutionary demands and democratic claims -- and in the end, she
shows us how, pressured by the Contra war and United States
hostility, they were caught in a Catch-22, forced to take harsh
measures in order to survive, alienated from many Nicaraguans because
of those measures. Their decline and fall were brutal and ugly and
can still provoke bitter divisions. Belli argues that, without the
confrontation with Washington, time might have tempered the
Sandinistas' worst instincts and nurtured their better natures but
the Cold War did not tolerate such dispensation. The Sandinistas were
simply broken in its iron grip.</TE>
<TE>   But history and human beings have a boundless capacity to surprise
and recover in unexpected ways. As terrible as the cost was, the
Sandinistas achieved significant gains that helped lay the
foundations of a modern and more democratic Nicaragua. They ended a
40-year repressive regime and, after a cruel counterrevolutionary war
that destroyed their popularity, they held free elections; when they
lost, they respected the outcome and gave up unfettered power. They
then passed control of the military peacefully from one commander to
another. Despite deep rancor and anger, they largely refrained from
abuse and bloodletting in the years that followed. Each of these
steps was an unprecedented advance, allowing the Sandinistas to
unexpectedly become midwives of a fragile Nicaraguan democracy. The
test now is whether democracy and markets can address the
overwhelming poverty and inequality that still ravage Nicaragua and
many of its neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   At a terrible cost to themselves and their revolution, the
Sandinistas also unwaveringly supported their rebel comrades in El
Salvador. Part of this was calculated realpolitik: the hope to have a
brother revolutionary state as a neighbor. But part of it also was
simple solidarity with another struggle against decades of military
rule and injustice. In another irony of history, this Sandinista
support gave the Salvadoran rebels the strength to force negotiations
to end the war that, in their turn, also laid the foundations of a
modern, democratic state in El Salvador. Again, revolution and war
birthed something unexpected and better than the past had been: not
perfect, not by any means, but a much better society than one ruled
by colonels, death squads and coffee plantations.</TE>
<TE>   Her decision to fight, to defy convention and become an
independent woman makes up most and the best of Belli's book. Then,
unpredictable and ornery as ever, this Sandinista militant falls in
love with an American journalist and moves first to Washington and
then to Santa Monica with him. They conceive and lose a child, then
adopt a Nicaraguan girl. This journey, from revolution in Managua to
middle-class domesticity in the country that so often has dominated
Nicaragua, raises countless personal and political questions that,
for once, Belli seems unable or unwilling fully to pose and answer.
It may simply be too personal and difficult to write of these things,
but I wish she had.</TE>
<TE>   Not many people get the chance, or seek, to create history and
change their world. Belli did, and "The Country Under My Skin" is a
full telling of what that feels like. One could easily criticize this
book and her for a kind of tropical romanticism and endless tumbling
into bed and insurrection, for causing as much pain at times as she
and her comrades sought to assuage. But it is too honestly told to
deserve a simple ironic lashing. Belli writes that she and others
like her "held a fervent belief in the inherent nobleness of the
human species.... [W]e were never afraid to dream and we had little
respect for cynicism.... A cause is not hopeless just because its
objectives aren't reached in one's lifetime." Many of those she
recalls here who believed these things died for them. Today in
another, colder age, few seem ready to hold or express such
sentiments. And maybe the world is not a better place as a result.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From 'The Country Under My Skin'</TE>
<TE>   Two things decided my life: my country and my sex. Perhaps because
my mother went into labor when she was at a baseball game in
Managua's stadium, it was my destiny to be drawn to the warmth of
crowds. My response to the multitude was an early indication I would
fear solitude and be attracted to the world of men.... Outside the
stadium from which my mother rushed to the hospital, there stood in
those days an equestrian statue of Anastasio Somoza Garcia, the
dictator who installed a family dynasty in Nicaragua in 1937. Who
knows what signals got mixed up in the amniotic fluid in my mother's
womb because .... I ended up taking up arms against the descendants
of that horse-riding despot, drawing on every resource I had, to join
in my country's struggle to free itself from one of the most enduring
tyrannies in Latin America.</TE>

<DH>The Little Friend, A Novel, Donna Tartt, Alfred A. Knopf:
560 pp., $26</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Francie Lin</AU>
<BD>Francie Lin is the associate editor of the Threepenny
Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By now the platitude about unremarkable second novels is so cliche,
but there seems to be no better way to talk about Donna Tartt's "The
Little Friend." Tartt is a gifted writer whose reputation is founded
on her first and -- until now -- only novel, "The Secret History," a
cool, elegant thriller about a group of classics students at a small
college in Vermont. Since its publication in 1992, it has spawned an
international coterie of readers so devoted to Tartt that in July,
Britain's Observer reported rumors of a black market for English
translations of "The Little Friend" in the Netherlands, where the
book received early publication in Dutch. "Her writing is so strange,
so memorable," said the Observer, quoting one fan from an Internet
chat room, "and she is such a beautiful person, that we know the book
will be worth the trouble."</LD>
<TE>   Now "The Little Friend" has appeared in the U.S. and unfortunately
does not live up to expectation. The novel, set in a small town in
Mississippi, centers on Harriet Cleve Dufresnes, a tough, wily
12-year-old whose older brother Robin was, at the age of 9, hanged
from a tree in his own front yard by a killer who remains at large.
His death has shattered the Cleves, an old Mississippi family,
already in decline after the Depression and a series of bad financial
investments, and "The Little Friend" is in part a portrait of the
strange, stagnant world inhabited by the survivors of a particularly
awful event.</TE>
<TE>   Harriet's mother, Charlotte, has fallen into a hazy grief-stricken
torpor, while Harriet's father is estranged from his wife and
daughters. Her sister Allison is a pretty, vague and haunted teenager
whose sense of reality is dubious at best, and her grandmother and
several great-aunts exist in various degrees of denial.</TE>
<TE>   Harriet, only a few months old when Robin was killed, has no
memory of her brother, but in a peculiar way this gap has served to
bring him into sharper focus than any actual remembrance might have.
Having grown up listening to the stories told by the adults around
them, both Harriet and Allison, "who had never in any proper sense
known him at all, nonetheless grew up certain of their dead brother's
favorite color (red) ... his favorite flavor of ice cream
(chocolate).... Consequently their relationship with their dead
brother was of the most intimate sort, his strong bright, immutable
character shining changelessly against the vagueness and vacillation
of their own characters .... [T]hey grew up believing that this was
due to some rare, angelic incandescence of nature on Robin's part,
and not at all to the fact that he was dead." In an effort to avenge
this shining notion of her brother, Harriet decides to track down
Robin's killer, and the novel follows the haphazard scheming of her
mission.</TE>
<TE>   All of this sounds promising enough, but somehow the potential is
lost in the execution. At the level of technical craft, Tartt is
still a master of beauty, and this in conjunction with her
sensitivity to loss and strangeness combines in peerless descriptions
of the beloved and the grotesque: glass ("on the mantelpiece
slumbered a chunky paperweight of aquamarine glass -- bubbled in its
heart, filtering the sun like seawater") or a crow's ripped wing
("glossy red coils that looked like red toothpaste"). Her characters,
particularly Harriet's battle-ax grandmother, Edie, are drawn with a
great deal of humor and sympathy, and she has a wonderful ear for
dialogue, rendering Edie's sly wit and Hely's highly irritating
pre-adolescent patter with brilliant accuracy.</TE>
<TE>   But overall "The Little Friend" is a bit like a bad pointillist
painting, each little dot drawn with exquisite care and yet not part
of a recognizable whole. The book has trouble deciding what it would
like to be. At times it presents itself as a mystery; at others it
turns into a young-adult-type novel about coming of age. It timidly
brings up the issue of race relations and class, but never in any
interesting way. The story has moments of suspense, but they are
undermined by a basic sluggishness.</TE>
<TE>   It is also hampered by an overdependence on dreams. Harriet
receives her injunction to go forth and deliver retribution in an
extended hallucination involving Houdini and penguins; portentous
dreams of darkness plague Harriet and others, including her suspect,
Danny Ratliff, an acquaintance of her brother's. The dream sequences
are well written and suitably ominous, but the book is so cluttered
with them that after a while one suspects that Tartt is compensating
for a lack of excitement elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Which isn't to say that "The Little Friend" isn't ambitious. Every
so often, it aspires to the heights of philosophical profundity,
soberly addressing the themes of memory, uncertainty, stories and
truth, and while it seems well within the bounds of Tartt's talent to
incorporate everything -- philosophy, suspense, character, emotion --
into a very good novel, these elements are so badly integrated here
that they cancel each other out. Occasionally laborious, often
random, resolved in a kind of pat, over-intellectualized way, "The
Little Friend" ultimately devolves into something well below its
aims.</TE>

<HD>The critic's eye, clear and cool</HD>
<DH>American Studies, Louis Menand, Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux:
306 pp., $25</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephen Metcalf</AU>
<BD>Stephen Metcalf is a writer whose work has appeared in
Slate, The New Republic and The New York Observer.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last year, Louis Menand won a Pulitzer for his history of American
pragmatism, "The Metaphysical Club." "The Metaphysical Club" was an
attempt -- a largely successful attempt -- to join company with
America's greatest cultural journalist, the Edmund Wilson of "To the
Finland Station" and "Patriotic Gore." For a book of such
unembarrassed intellectual ambition, "The Metaphysical Club" was a
huge hit; and if it fell short of Wilson's standard, it's only
because no one could breathe the same lucid fire into the
scrupulously undogmatic pragmatism that Wilson once poured into his
studies of socialism and the literature of the Civil War.</LD>
<LD>   Now Menand has published "American Studies," a collection of
essays written over the last decade, covering everything from
America's founding modernist, William James, to America's favorite
smut magnate, Larry Flynt. For all the success of its award-winning
predecessor, "American Studies" should not be mistaken for an
afterthought: It represents the heart of Menand's work (he is
essentially an essayist) and demonstrates his status as his
generation's premier critical talent. It is easily among the finest
collections of essays by an American critic since Lionel Trilling's
"The Liberal Imagination."</LD>
<TE>   "American Studies" charts the trajectory of Menand's own career,
from a well-behaved academic to a somewhat cheeky magazine eminence.
In an industry where the average lead paragraph often seems styled to
wake the dead, Menand writes with a deceptive lack of pizzazz; but
his is a deep talent. He unites the spirit of roving amateurism with
a patient, scholarly demeanor; he is very clever, without once
looking up to see if you're laughing; and he has that rare ability to
say something utterly fresh and unexpected, and yet to have it strike
the reader as true on contact. The first four or so essays, superb as
they are, still have something of a demure, quarterly feel to them.
But by the heart of the collection, once Menand has started to write
about media stardom, about Norman Mailer and William Shawn's New
Yorker, he has hit a groove; and suddenly the noiseless, patient
writer has you in his thrall.</TE>
<TE>   One after the other, Menand slowly takes apart various enthusiasms
that have flattered the educated middle classes in decades past --
Norman Mailer (the 1950s), the counterculture (the 1960s), Pauline
Kael and Christopher Lasch (the 1970s). The effect, I warn you, is
not always salutary. For reading Menand is a little like watching
Tiger Woods play golf: The skill is incomparable, but the suaveness
and efficiency are perpetually on the verge of driving you mad. You
keep thinking, if only something of the maudit or slovenly would
invade the prose, if only for the space of a dependent clause.</TE>
<TE>   The key to such rhetorical control is the excess of others; and
many of the writers Menand selects for disassembly seem mostly guilty
of being anti-Menands. None more so than poor Kael, whom Menand
clearly loves, but whom he finally cannot abide: "The writing is all
in the same key, and strictly molto con brio," he tells us. "There is
no modulation of tone or (which would be more welcome) of thought.
She just keeps slugging away." She is prone to "garrulousness and
compositional dishevelment." Where others have been garrulous and
disheveled, there Menand brings a signature coolness. The 1960s, he
tells us, presumably laying out his own qualifications, is a subject
that "could use the attention of some people who really don't care."</TE>
<TE>   Menand's favorite technique is what we might call "liberal
domestication": He likes to show how the seemingly radical
breakthrough was in retrospect mostly a media or middle-class fad.
Thus the counterculture "had all the attributes of a typical mass
culture episode: it was a lifestyle that could be practiced on
weekends; it came into fashion when the media discovered it and went
out of fashion when the media lost interest; and it was, from the
moment it penetrated the middle class, thoroughly commercialized." Or
Mailer's worldview, advertised as outre, is in its essence
"comfortably inside the realm of liberal middle-class culture.
Everyone within that culture salutes the principles of moral freedom
and intellectual honesty, and loathes the idea (without necessarily
foregoing the convenience) of plastic."</TE>
<TE>   The morbid teen picks up "The Bhagavad Gita" or "Catch-22" and is
made new. Menand picks a book up, and leafs through it like it was a
10-year-old copy of Vanity Fair, left for dead on a sun porch. Can
you believe how seriously we once greeted "Batman Returns"? For what
fascinates Menand most of all is anachronism. Thus Mailer is "a man
-- in 2002, possibly the last man -- of the 1950s." Hunter S.
Thompson "in short, is practically the only person in America still
living circa 1972." The 1960s "stripped of its idealism and sexiness,
lingered on" into the doleful 1970s. By the Vietnam era, The New
Yorker was still practicing a "politics of whimsy ... a politics
nobody in 1968 was likely to be paying attention to."</TE>
<TE>   Why does Menand return so frequently to unplanned obsolescence?
The clue comes in those rare moments of rhetorical overreach on
Menand's own part. Running up the score on a reliably silly opponent
-- media studies academics -- his insouciance gets the better of him:
Scholars, Menand tells us, sometimes write "as though they had
forgotten that no one has ever been forced to watch a television
show." But of course they have, and by the legion: the public school
students who have been force-fed Channel One by the Edison School's
founder, Chris Whittle. "All rock stars want to make money," Menand
insists in the essay on Rolling Stone magazine, "for the same reasons
everyone else in a liberal society wants to make money: more toys and
more autonomy."</TE>
<TE>   This is hardly news -- when it comes to Mick Jagger and lucre, the
filthier the better, presumably -- and as a general rule, tingly
neo-con maxims delivered more of a charge back in 1990. Nonetheless,
the suggestion runs subtly throughout "American Studies": We are all
equally implicated in America's commercialism. "Everyone participates
in this system," as Menand elegantly conveys it, "and partakes of its
benefits (individual economic opportunity and national economic
expansion) and puts up with its drawbacks (cheap goods, an often
banal and sometimes exploitative popular culture, financial
uncertainty)."</TE>
<TE>   And so we are led to ask the very Menandian question: What does it
say about us, and the 1990s, that the decade's star critic was so
poised, so balanced, so meticulously acid-free? Menand's name for his
approach is "historical criticism," and what he is guarding against
is, he tells us, "the element of wishful thinking that infects all
critical writing." Modern American life is designed around
commercialism and progress; and thus it tends endlessly and
remorselessly towards change. "[T]he impulse to hold on to the past
is very strong," he admits in the introduction to "American Studies."
"A lot of energy and imagination are consumed trying to fit old
systems into new settings, though the pegs keep getting squarer and
the holes keep getting rounder."</TE>
<TE>   Given America's tendency to destroy the past, we must temper our
enthusiasms with a kind of wise insouciance; and Menand admits as
much by ending his preface with the proposition "Today is the only
day we have." This is Menand to a T -- is he intoning sententiously,
or is he winking at me? Anyhow, it is a bit of literary hocus-pocus.
You can rework it in either direction, after all, and still sound
rather fancy: We are borne ceaselessly back into the past; the
shadows of futurity cast themselves upon the present; tomorrow never
dies. "American Studies" is a magnificent achievement, and it is no
exaggeration to say every page is an example of critical lucidity,
humor and calm. No one writing in a generalist spirit even touches
Menand. But his twin emphasis, on tweaking liberal aspirations and on
the inexorable American "today," comes at a small, if often hidden,
cost.</TE>
<TE>   We liberals, in the NPR-and-Volvo sense, are pulled forward by our
ignorance and an insatiable gullibility. But sometimes we're pulled
forward by our liberalism: what Trilling meant when he argued that
even a vague sentiment can sometimes help bring to fruition a world
less brutal, less ugly and less vulgar than the one we know today. Is
this an important omission from the book? Or am I just being morbid?</TE>

<LD>Touch Wood: Short Stories, Joe Ashby Porter, Turtle Point Press: 192
pp., $15.95</LD>
<LD>   Joe Ashby Porter's reckless, feckless writing weaves itself around
characters that often seem to hop out of fairy tales: a milliner; a
Tlingit fisherman named Johnny John Hawk; a hair wrapper; various
Frenchmen. It is fiction that consistently pokes fun at logic using
bizarre sentence structure; oversized language more appropriate for
members of the Lollipop Guild: words like "yore," "thenceforth," and
"wont" swim in the same soup as "gustatory," "fetching," and
"tumble-fluffing." "Misty silvers wiggle into the happy storm
drains." Mind-altering but not mind-blowing. Depressing but not
desperate, like the French father who tells his 30-year-old
stay-at-home son that his mother died while giving birth to him (the
son) in order to keep him from getting married and depriving the old
man of free labor. This is the stuff of childhood nightmares: evil
elves and moon-faced fishermen.</LD>

<TE>   The Conscience of a Liberal Reclaiming the Compassionate Agenda,
Paul Wellstone, University of Minnesota Press:</TE>
<TE>   216 pp., $17.95 paper</TE>
<TE>   "The worst thing that could happen," the late Paul Wellstone
writes in "The Conscience of a Liberal," a memoir that might serve as
well as his epitaph, "would be to lose your dignity, to vote against
your convictions, and lose the next election anyway." During his
years in the Senate, Wellstone fought for health care and welfare
reform and against standardized testing in public schools and the
criminalization of mental illness. Wellstone wrote as honestly as he
lived: "I miss my dad so much," he writes after describing his
father's death. He admits to feeling guilty over his parents
working-class roots, and he wishes that his older brother, a man who
has suffered from a series of what he calls "nervous breakdowns,"
could enjoy a full and happy life. In his life and in his words, the
senator from Minnesota, a man many called "embarrassingly liberal,"
never lost his dignity.</TE>

<TE>   Black Novel With Argentines, Luisa Valenzuela, Translated from the
Spanish, by Toby Talbot, Latin American Literary Review Press: 220
pp., $17.95</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to Dostoevsky-ville, land of guilt and exile. Land of no
escape from oneself. Land of the fiction of fear. Writers experienced
in the culture of tyranny (and there are many kinds, but in Luisa
Valenzuela's case, it is the kind of tyranny that tears bodies apart
and leaves them by the side of the road) convey fear better than any
crime writer looking to be optioned. Augustin Palant, our unlikely
hero, is a writer who has recently left his home in Buenos Aires with
the understanding that any day he would be murdered (like so many
others during an unspecified repressive regime) if he stayed. At a
New York literary event he meets another writer, Roberta, who is also
exiled from Argentina. Augustin is blocked, in spite of a generous
grant. "Write with your body," she advises him. He buys a gun to
protect himself from the dangerous New York streets. Wandering around
the city one night, he is given a ticket to an underground play. He
follows an actress home and shoots her in the head. Why? He doesn't
know. Until Roberta takes him home for soup and an herbal bath. It
takes months for him to fully drag her into his despair. Roberta's
closest friend is a dominatrix, so the novel is peppered with forays
into that world of cruelty for play, and also with memories of
Argentina, where the torture was performed with intent to kill.</TE>
<TE>   Artaud, Bataille, Cortazar: This is the tradition of art and
artifice of which Valenzuela is a vivid student. Sex -- perverse,
cathartic, flailing, more about role-playing and power than love --
mirrors the political, moral and physical decay of Buenos Aires and
New York. There isn't a chance that either character will crawl from
the wreckage of this novel cleansed and whole. No more than
Raskolnikov. Hope for the future? Pick a different novel.</TE>

<LD>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Apt. 3W, Gabriel Brownstein,
W.W. Norton: 224 pp., $23.95</LD>
<TE>   In this irresistible collection of stories by Gabriel Brownstein,
a prewar apartment building on New York's Upper West Side becomes an
outsized cabinet of wonder whose curiosities are the tenants
themselves. The title story finds an aspiring early-century couple
(he's Jewish, she's a Southern WASP) giving birth to an alarmingly
Old World octogenarian who's every bit as perplexed by his bizarre
predicament as his parents are: "I used to be, if I remember correct,
Mr. Solomon Uschitz ...." Now called Benjamin Button, the erstwhile
Uschitz grows up to be an elderly hot jazz pianist known as the
"Hey-Hey Hebrew," a devoted middle-age husband, an archetypal 1970s
stoner and finally a helpless infant. "A Penal Colony All His Own,
11E" tells of the eccentric young Kevin MacMichaelman, who transforms
his late parents' apartment into the creepy "MacMichaelman Museum of
Kevin," complete with vitrine-housed memorabilia and taxidermied
family pets. In "Bachelor Party," a Jewish groom-to-be tells his
friends the disquieting tale of a long-ago erotic psychodrama in
which his then-girlfriend, a shiksa bombshell whose ancestors
happened to be Nazis, demanded to be treated like a Holocaust victim.
And "The Dead Fiddler, 5E" is the ballad of lovely Jessica Lenzner,
an overachieving teen whose pneumatic charms are as much an object of
general fascination as her sad fate: being forced to marry the
ultra-Orthodox Shmelke Motl when her psychoanalyst dad suddenly gets
religion.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the building's improbable narratives are related by Davey
Birnbaum, an adolescent resident whose motley collection of friends
grows up on West 89th Street playing Dungeons and Dragons, tossing
Nerf footballs and arguing the respective merits of Cheryl Tiegs and
Farrah Fawcett Majors. This achy undercurrent of nostalgia buoys up
Brownstein's big themes -- thorny stuff like assimilation, voyeurism
and role-playing -- and the stories themselves are often, curiously
enough, reinventions of narratives first put down by Kafka,
Fitzgerald and Hawthorne.</TE>
<TE>   But Brownstein's more immediate precursors are Jeffrey Eugenides,
whose "Virgin Suicides" evoked a similarly tweaked pubescent
environment, and Steven Millhauser, whose youthful dreamers construct
deliciously overwrought microcosms of Americana. As inventive as it
is endearing, and as hilarious as it is often horrific, "The Curious
Case of Benjamin Button, Apt. 3W" is a handsome edifice, a breathing
monument to childhood, to Manhattan, and, in its good-natured way, to
literature itself.</TE>

<TE>   Moist, Mark Haskell Smith, LA Weekly Books/St. Martin's:  310 pp.,
$24.95</TE>
<TE>   Mark Haskell Smith's energetic thriller is an ode to the
hard-boiled Los Angeles of Raymond Chandler and James Ellroy spun out
in brighter-than-life Starburst colors: "A city where roses and cacti
grew side by side and bright orange-and-purple birds of paradise
sprang up out of cracks in the sidewalk." Across this Day-Glo
wonderland, Smith stretches an unlikely cast (and an even more
unlikely plot), starting with Bob, a lanky dude who works in a
pathology lab, and his girlfriend, Maura, a masturbation therapist.
When a severed arm shows up at the lab, Bob is immediately taken by
the bodacious babe tattooed on it; it's as if he's transformed into a
slacker Petrarch and she's his mythic, ink-on-flesh Laura. The arm's
owner turns out to be a foot soldier in a Mexican American mob, and
Bob, of course, gets mixed up with these quarrelsome hoodlums. In
fact, he ditches Maura to pursue his criminal destiny as "Roberto"
(and to pursue the girl in the tattoo), while Maura hooks up with the
LAPD detective assigned to the severed-arm case. And this, really, is
only the half of it.</TE>
<TE>   Like its bold palette, "Moist" is aggressively over the top, yet
each bizarre turn is as stubbornly logical as it is wonderfully
impossible. And it's a small, precious miracle that this L.A. story
boldly surges ahead for more than 200 pages before anyone even
mentions a screenplay. No wonder Bob -- Roberto -- is so psyched to
live in Smith's "city of the future, hope of the world."</TE>

<DH>Kafka Goes to the Movies, Hanns Zischler, Translated from
the German by Susan H. Gillespie, University of Chicago Press: 146
pp., $30 A Year at the Movies: One Man's Filmgoing Odyssey, Kevin
Murphy, Harper/Entertainment: 368 pp., $14.95 paper</DH>

<AU>Richard Schickel</AU>
<BD>Richard Schickel reviews movies for Time. His latest
book, "Good Morning Mr Zip Zip Zip," will be published next spring.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1907, the first permanent movie theater opened in Franz Kafka's
Prague. It showed little one-reel films, some fictional and some not,
and the writer, at the time largely preoccupied with finding his
unique literary voice, occasionally attended it as well as other
"Kinematographs" all over Europe in the next few years. He sometimes
wrote about what he saw, in letters and in his diary, pretty much in
the dispassionate spirit of the flaneur, an idler keeping a bemused,
intelligent eye on the passing scene. Hanns Zischler, a German
actor-director-obsessive, makes too much of what little Kafka had to
say on this topic in "Kafka Goes to the Movies."</LD>
<LD>   By 2001, the "progress" of popular culture having trumped (not to
say swamped) most other forms of expression, it was possible for
Kevin Murphy, late of the cult television program "Mystery Science
Theater 3000," to embark on an odyssey during which he saw at least
one movie every day of the year. He, in turn, makes too little of
what he saw in "A Year at the Movies."</LD>
<LD>   It is perhaps not hard to guess which of these writers'
experiences was the more Kafkaesque. It is possibly harder to imagine
which of their books is, finally, the more interesting, but here's a
hint: It is a taste for the obscure, telling detail that makes any
writing about the movies worthwhile.</LD>
<TE>   You have to give Murphy credit. The range of venues open to him
was far wider than Kafka's, and he manfully traveled the world to
experience as many of them as possible. He went to the movies in a
huge igloo in Quebec, at the world's smallest admission-charging
theater (it's in some guy's home in Australia), at the Cannes,
Sundance and Midnight Sun festivals, in drive-ins along Route 66, at
the Silent Movie on Fairfax Avenue. On Thanksgiving Day he smuggled
an entire turkey dinner into a 'plex and consumed it while watching
"Monsters, Inc."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy can be very funny on some of these subjects. His riff on
airline movies is terrific. So is his outrage over shelling out cash
to see a movie and then being forced to watch paid advertising shorts
before it begins. But, frankly, a little of this goes a long way. He
too often stops talking about the movies and fills his pages with
lengthy reflections on the width of the seats, the need for adequate
armrests, the rude behavior (and smelliness) of his fellow patrons,
and, most obsessively, the quality of the popcorn or the state of his
own digestive tract as he confronts the snack bar's other queasy
offerings.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy's annoyances are everyone's annoyances. But his is,
unfortunately, a populist heart, and a somewhat geeky one at that --
drawn to sentimentality about his family and friends and about those
earnest souls who, at some cost to themselves, keep cinema's flame
burning bright in variously eccentric venues. But he is too much the
perpetual teenager, braying his contempt for the way movies are
exhibited in postmodern America while too often missing the point of
his exercise, which is the picture on the screen.</TE>
<TE>   Each of his chapters is ostensibly devoted to a week of
moviegoing, and each begins with a list of films seen within that
time frame. Many of these are movies that demand a certain complexity
of response -- "Pollock," "The Widow of St. Pierre," "Moulin Rouge,"
"My Night at Maude's," "The Big Red One" -- but about them (and more)
he remains silent. For instance, when he sees "The Shining," he
devotes himself instead to his annoyance with the pop-up ads on the
movie Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   This is too bad, because when he engages with torpid, critically
overhyped products like "In the Mood for Love" or "Breaking the
Waves," his populist contempt is well-judged and smartly stated. But
one gets the impression that he is afraid of his own intelligence.
Musing on the ghastly remake of "Planet of the Apes," it occurs to
him: "A movie was just something to go to, and ten bucks worth of
snacks were just something to do while there. The dangerous
complacency of the average moviegoer filled me up to my beard which
smelled like popcorn oil." How true. But how sad that Murphy is more
often part of the problem, rather than part of the solution, which
has to begin with authentic and passionate critical engagement,
despite the greasy tacos and unkempt restrooms.</TE>
<TE>   One does not imagine that Kafka's primitive Kinematographs were
any more salubrious than, say, the Mall of America multiplex. But
what did he care? "We are happy," he writes, "when we do what is
almost superfluous but fail to do precisely what is almost
necessary." Movies, obviously, fell into the former category for him.
Only once did they fully engage him. There is a little sequence in a
movie called "The White Slave Girl," in which the heroine is abducted
for unspeakable purposes. This he conflates with a real-life meeting
with a woman on a train, whereupon, writing with his faithful
companion, Max Brod, he tries to turn these shards of memory into the
only extant chapter of an unfinished novel they briefly planned to
write together.</TE>
<TE>   For the rest, trying rather desperately to pump up his very
slender volume and support its intriguing title, Zischler must
content himself with even-tinier fragments. Worse, he retells,
occasionally in excruitatingly detail, the plots of movies -- and
even a stage musical about them -- which someone mentioned to Kafka,
though there is no evidence of his actually having seen the work.
There is even a strange passage in which Kafka muses not on a film
but on its poster, which features the German actor Albert Bassermann,
whose Hamlet the writer admired but whose appearance in a movie
called "The Other" filled him with foreboding: " ... I felt sorry for
B., as if he were the most unfortunate of men.... [A]ware of the most
extreme uselessness of the expenditure of all his great powers ... he
becomes older, weak ... sinks away somewhere in the grayness of
time."</TE>
<TE>   Poor Bassermann, making his actor's living, trying quite soberly,
as a quotation from an essay he wrote at the time makes clear, to
master a new medium. And, of course, quite unaware that he had come
under Kafka's gimlet gaze.</TE>
<TE>   This is what finally makes this book -- it should have been a
magazine piece -- so curiously seductive. Kafka brings so much
neurasthenic energy to bear on such trivial matters -- so much
quivering intelligence at war with so much dither -- that he becomes
quite an engaging, sympathetic and even faintly comic figure,
particularly since during this period (roughly 1908-13) he was
writing (and destroying) the first draft of "Amerika," finishing
"Metamorphosis" and engaging in his largely epistolary, entirely
ambiguous, courtship of Felice Bauer.</TE>
<TE>   This material -- probably just a subtext for the narrowly focused
Zischler -- becomes, at last, his text, and a portrait takes shape
not of a cinephile but of an intelligence, an oddly determined
sensibility, emerging from the conventions and distractions of
ordinary middle-class, middle-European life, beginning its immortal
assertions against the conventions and distractions of ordinary
literary life. Watching Kafka emerge -- forgive the absurd comparison
-- is worth a thousand disquisitions on popcorn culture. I'm not
saying that writing about films can ever achieve that level of
intensity. But the aspiration should nag at us. It's not much crazier
than daring to write a story about a man turning into a giant bug.</TE>

<HD>Lords of risky programming</HD>
<DH>A new wave of British shows is headed here. 'Masterpiece
Theatre' they're not.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Jensen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>London</DL>
<LD>Meet the Kumars. They're in the process of immigrating to the U.S.,
where they'll change their family name to Ortega.</LD>
<LD>   Like so many immigrants before them, they carry a burning desire
to fit in and strike it rich in America. They also want to bring
along a little something from the home country: a hotly coveted
crossover TV show concept.</LD>
<LD>   Thus "The Kumars at No. 42," a bizarre British talk show in which
real guests interact with fake hosts, will become "The Ortegas" when
NBC restages it for American audiences.</LD>
<TE>   When it comes to TV, Anglo-American trade is flourishing, with
envelope-pushing British programmers dishing up ever more peculiar
fare and their U.S. counterparts unabashedly snapping it up quicker
than you can say "risk-averse."</TE>
<TE>   The Brits, NBC Entertainment President Jeff Zucker freely admits,
"are a great farm team."</TE>
<TE>   Look what else they're cultivating here on the farm these days:</TE>
<TE>   "The Office," which recently ended its run on BBC2, centers on a
group of colleagues in a stationery company, going about their
mundane workday, flirting and rejecting co-workers' advances as they
break for tea, stealing Post-It notes, fighting vicious rounds of
cubicle politics, and being trapped into baby-sitting a boss as he
blows notes on a beer bottle while the rest of the staff has headed
to the pub.</TE>
<TE>   It looks like a documentary, has no laugh track and no obvious
jokes. Rupert Gavin, chief executive of BBC Worldwide, the public
broadcaster's commercial arm, frankly calls it weird. Yet it has won
top awards recently as Britain's best sitcom. It's been so popular
that the BBC sells a book of the scripts, side by side with cookbooks
from its TV chefs. Americans will be able to decide for themselves in
January, when it will air on cable's BBC America channel.</TE>
<TE>   The upcoming drama "Grease Monkeys," as dark and as politically
incorrect as "The Sopranos," portrays the world of a dishonest,
drug-fueled South Asian car mechanic in Manchester. Mal Young, BBC's
controller for drama series, calls it "racist, sexist, homophobic. It
challenges every preconception." It's too early to say whether it
will travel to the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The current much-hyped production is the BBC's "Fame Academy," a
Friday-night talent contest with an element of "Big Brother."
Aspiring stars have moved into London's biggest private mansion,
Witanhurst House, which has been wired with cameras so viewers can
spy on the drama and endless practicing leading up to each week's
sing-off. Contestants are booted each week.</TE>
<TE>   For a decade now, British TV executives and their counterparts
across Europe have been scrambling genres, shaking up production
techniques and mining unusual slices of life for television that
falls far outside the circumscribed boundaries of four-camera sitcoms
and cop dramas, or even the historical period dramas that populate
PBS' "Masterpiece Theatre."</TE>
<TE>   Americans have had a taste of what it's all about since the summer
of 1999, with "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" and, later, "Survivor"
and this summer's "American Idol," all of which took standard, tired
"reality" formats and turned them into high-stakes prime-time drama.
Cable's has prospered by adopting the Brits' reinvention of how-to
shows, adding human tears and laughter to the humdrum room make-over
on "Trading Spaces."</TE>
<TE>   Now, the British are poised for a wholesale invasion, welcomed
with open arms by U.S. executives. American television is in the
midst of a crisis driven by an uncomfortable convergence of
prohibitively high costs for traditional shows such as "Frasier" and
"ER," fickle, fragmented audiences in a multichannel environment and
increasingly complex financing schemes, and it's hungry for fresh
ideas, especially economical ones.</TE>
<TE>   British TV executives, Zucker says, "are more willing to take
risks because the stakes are a little lower. They take risks we're
not willing to take right away." That, in turn, "allows us to see
things and then make a decision."</TE>
<TE>   What the Brits have is talk shows, such as "The Kumars at No. 42"
and, earlier, "Mrs. Merton" and "Ali G," in which the hosts are
actors, in character, and the guests, not always clued in, are real.
Sitcoms run without laugh tracks and in real time; real people get
prime-time make-overs. Documentaries might be real or they might just
be mockumentaries. There are plenty more Brit-style unscripted series
on the way, such as the 15-night-in-a-row "I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me
Out of Here," a sort-of "Survivor" for has-been celebrities that ABC
is remaking for February.</TE>
<TE>   Although the U.S. has been able to develop some of its own
"reality" shows, such as "The Bachelor," executives say they will
continue to buy plenty from abroad. In addition, says Andrea Wong,
ABC's executive in charge of alternative programming, "the advantage
is, I can see it on tape," instead of having to conceptualize it from
a written proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Colin Jarvis, BBC Worldwide's director of programming and
operations, says he will "wager my next dinner" that a U.S. broadcast
network will soon be airing a version of the latest trend to sweep
Britain, personal make-over shows, a sort of "Trading Spaces" for
fashion and lifestyle. BBC America has one such show set to debut in
December, "What Not to Wear," in which two extremely candid fashion
journalists set out to make over real, less-than-perfect people,
recruited -- not always willingly -- by friends and family members.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. networks are also venturing beyond those low-budget
formats into trickier-to-translate comedies and dramas. Last month,
ABC quietly forged an unprecedented deal with Britain's Granada
Television to jointly produce drama series, with an eye to launching
a single show simultaneously in the two countries, perhaps as early
as next season.</TE>
<TE>   NBC, meanwhile, is eyeing a remake of the British show "Coupling,"
whose American pilot has just been shot, as a quasi-replacement for
its about-to-disappear "Friends." The show, which revolves around
almost nothing but the sex lives of its thirtysomething characters,
won't be able to play in the "Friends" early evening time slot,
however, because it is too racy. It's currently airing on BBC
America, and although that cable network doesn't release ratings, its
executives say the show is doing very well.</TE>
<TE>   NBC is especially receptive to British imports, both because
unlike CBS, Fox and ABC, it is not owned by a studio that provides a
steady stream of programs, and because it has aging hit comedies
("Friends" and "Frasier" in particular). So it is paying handsomely
for shows like "Coupling" and "The Kumars at No. 42": According to
Variety, it has agreed to pick up the full $750,000-per-episode cost
of the latter show, after beating out Fox for the U.S. rights. And
the program has been promised a home on one of NBC's Must-See TV
nights, Tuesday or Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   It's a decidedly unusual show. In Britain, the "Kumar family" is
Indian; its "son" has a talk show studio in the back of the home. But
before guests can get to it, they must run a gantlet of silly
questions from the rest of the family members. NBC is casting the
family as Mexican Americans to make them more relatable to the U.S.
audience.</TE>
<TE>   A less-rigid system</TE>
<TE>   Going into the 1980s, British television was as regimented as the
U.S. system, executives say. The success of American import "Dallas"
on the commercial ITV network (the BBC is commercial-free and paid
for by a TV-set tax, was a wake-up call at the BBC, says Paul Lee,
the chief executive officer of BBC America.</TE>
<TE>   So the British started mixing things up. Taking a cue from the Fox
network's "Cops" and "America's Most Wanted," they added dramatic
arcs and music and suspense to rev up inexpensive "reality" video,
says Alan Yentob, the BBC's director of drama, entertainment and
children's programming. A whole genre of what the Brits call
"documentary soaps" followed, turning the cameras on life in an
airport, a hotel, even on that dreaded British rite of passage,
driving school. Soon, drama and comedy reversed the process and were
stealing techniques from "reality" programming.</TE>
<TE>   British TV executives attribute some of their recent success to a
less rigid development process than the American counterpart. "Dog
Eat Dog" went through three pilots to find the right formula. Series
often start out on one of the BBC's lesser channels, where they can
be tinkered with before moving to BBC1 if they are a success. That
technique allowed "The Weakest Link" to be nurtured into a huge hit.
"It was matured like a cheese," Jarvis says. "In your market, you
wind up the clock and set it running even on Day One."</TE>
<TE>   The BBC also has BBC America as a testing ground. Even though it's
hard for many TV watchers to find it, it has proven useful for
executives to assess what will work in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The BBC's public status also gives it a freedom not unlike that of
HBO, according to Lee, who says ad-sales-driven networks must keep
viewers happy every three minutes or viewers will turn away. HBO and
the BBC have time to find something to please viewers. "There's a
long-term sense of value," he says, which allows more risk-taking.</TE>
<TE>   The greater flexibility in the British system has yielded
unexpected creative results too. The BBC's Young started the daytime
drama anthology series "The Doctors," in 2000, that has become a
sought-after outlet for actors and writers during their down time,
and has allowed him to develop new talent. Meanwhile, "The Office"
started life as a drama, Young says, except it didn't quite work as
one, so it was reconceptualized as a comedy. Not only that, but the
creators were not television people. In the U.S., BBC Worldwide's
Gavin says, "there is no way you would get away with an unknown
writer saying, 'That's what I want to do,' " which is how "The
Office" came to be. And such an offbeat mix of reality and comedy, he
says, "would be homogenized out."</TE>
<TE>   NBC's Zucker agrees. "They take risks both on camera and behind
the scenes that we mistakenly don't have the guts to do. We are way
too beholden to people we know and people who have done it before."</TE>
<TE>   But changing the U.S. system is hard, he says. "It's an embedded
system that is difficult to change, but it would behoove all of us to
do so."</TE>
<TE>   The obvious advantages of shared language have led Americans to
mine British TV for ideas going back to "All in the Family" and
"Sanford and Son," and some of the new imports are sure to work.
Satellite, mobile phones and the Internet have made the cultures even
closer, Yentob says. "Things are traveling now. It's a smaller
world."</TE>
<TE>   In a development that may make the world smaller still, a new
British law is expected to open up the private side of Britain's TV
business to limited U.S. investment next spring, and already several
U.S. companies have started sniffing around.</TE>
<TE>   But just how far U.S. audiences are willing to play along is up
for debate. A no-laugh-track British comedy, "The Royle Family,"
which featured a lower-middle-class family sitting on the couch
watching TV and unspooled in real time, was a huge hit in the U.K.
and did well on BBC America, but never made it past the pilot stage
last season at CBS.</TE>
<TE>   Shows such as "The Office" are a big challenge, says Lloyd Braun,
chairman of ABC Entertainment. "You really have to retrain the
audience," he says, citing the difficulties of even a show like ABC's
"Sports Night," whose totally different rhythms attracted only a
limited, if loyal, audience. "It can't be so different that it's
alienating. Sometimes baby steps are better."</TE>
<TE>   Grit rules</TE>
<TE>   Some U.S. executives think the appeal of British programming will
remain limited to reality shows and will always be just a small
niche. "The Europeans got better at reality because they couldn't
afford the big budgets," says Jamie Kellner, chairman and CEO of
Turner Broadcasting System, who oversees the WB network. He adds, "I
don't think it will become a big portion of anybody's schedule. There
are things the American public knows they like and we need to find
ways to give them that."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, there remain major differences in taste between the two
cultures. Brits like real-life dramas, so "Big Brother" did better in
the U.K. than it has in the U.S., where "Survivor" fares better,
thanks to Americans' preference for fantasy.</TE>
<TE>   "The American audience likes aspirational stuff. Here, people want
to see themselves," Young says. "We love the gritty."</TE>
<TE>   British TV executives are still pinching themselves at the
turnabout in trade relations, although not everyone is convinced that
British television is so innovative.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Thompson, a former BBC executive who recently took over as
head of Britain's commercial Channel Four, in August used the
prestigious MacTaggart Lecture at Edinburgh's International
Television Festival to lash out at what he called the risk-averse
British television culture, which he said leads to shows that are
"dull, mechanical and samey." Real creativity, he said, was coming
out of the U.S., with Fox's "24," HBO's "Six Feet Under" and MTV's
"Jackass." Critics have complained about the Brits' chase after
ratings at the expense of quality. Ex-pat British journalist Andrew
Sullivan recently complained in the New Republic about the cultural
coarsening of America thanks to all the British reality imports..</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, a quick flip through the British TV dial turns up quirky
documentaries such as a history of London's sewer system, but also
just as much derivative fare as in the U.S. Personal make-over shows
abound. "Popstars" and "Pop Idol" have spawned numerous copycats.
Channel Four just announced an operatic version of "Pop Idol" called
"Operatunity" and a new series in which housewives swap homes, the
logical extension of "Changing Rooms."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, says the BBC's Yentob, "you want to say 'enough
already,' " although he notes that audiences also turned out in huge
numbers for a recent BBC documentary on the building of a pyramid. It
drew a 34% share of those watching TV, something even top series in
the U.S. don't often do.</TE>
<TE>   How long the trade deficit will run in favor of Britain remains a
hot debate. The window of opportunity for British television will be
short, thinks David Liddiment, the outgoing director of programs for
Britain's ITV network and the man who put "Millionaire" on the air.
Speaking at a recent international television conference in Cannes,
France, he said, "The American television business is very
competitive. We will see the Americans coming through strong.
Americans are not going to sit back and allow the Europeans to
dominate this market."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Turner's Kellner maintains that when all is said and
done, "the reliable system is the Hollywood system."</TE>
<TE>   But BBC Worldwide's Jarvis doesn't buy that, and from his perch in
London, he says that not only is the British TV community ready to
take on the Americans, but "on the basis of shows traveling from this
side of the ocean to yours, we even seem to be a little better at
it."</TE>

<LD>What a laugh! You talk about many "A-list" script doctors sometimes
making between $200,000 and $300,000 per week.</LD>
<LD>   Inside a movie theater, where the average person is waiting to be
entertained, ask someone if they know who the screenwriter is. Ask
them if they know who the script doctor is. Ask them if they care.</LD>
<LD>   "One A-list script surgeon adds, 'We make a lot of money, and a
lot of people hate us, but a lot of movies wouldn't get made without
script doctors....' "</LD>
<TE>   Our take on this? Puhleese! Too many garbage movies get made for
too much money.</TE>
<TE>   We are doing rewrites and script doctoring. But we are not yet
considered "A-list." Maybe "D-list." We sometimes make between $2,000
and $3,000 per week, or $4,000 per job. But we are quick. Can bang it
out usually in a week -- and it works.</TE>
<TE>   A top-line producer in town has twice given us a script and told
us to get rid of 20 pages, but to make sure it won't be noticeable to
the original writer or anyone else. Done.</TE>
<TE>   After that, let's just say we have no problem working anonymously
in the business. We'll consider it paying our dues.</TE>

<LD>I wasn't surprised by what I read in your article about the "King of
the Hill" writers going to Texas ("Deep in the heart of Arlen,
Texas," Oct. 20).</LD>
<LD>   I just can't understand why people writing about Texas have to
always keep writing the same old mundane stereotypes -- rednecks and
barbecue, horses and trucks, twangy talk and country music, etc.</LD>
<LD>   Same old garbage from Hollywood. Every book and every movie, from
"The Last Picture Show" to "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre." When will
these people find different material in Texas for a change? Most of
us are nothing like that. People come here and expect to see it and
get confused when they can't find it. At least "Terms of Endearment"
wasn't "Bubbafied."</LD>
<TE>   On the other hand, most people never realize that "Rollerball"
wasn't Detroit -- it was Houston -- and they don't believe it when
you tell them. And they also don't believe you when you tell them
that the U.S. Open scene in "Tin Cup" was not filmed in North
Carolina. It was filmed in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   I had a small part in that movie. I asked the director, Ron
Shelton, why they were doing that, and he said that nobody would
believe it was Texas. Too many trees. I said, "Do you think that's
because of all the stupid stereotypes about Texas from years of
movies?"</TE>
<TE>   He said, "Exactly."</TE>

<LD>Producer Ross Hunter had greater responsibility for the look of
Douglas Sirk's soap operas -- and their very existence -- than Sirk
himself ("Back to the days of subversive innocence," Oct. 27).</LD>
<LD>   It was Hunter, a big fan of the weepies of the '30s and '40s that
Thomson mentioned, who convinced Universal executives that pairing
aging actresses with their contract heartthrobs Rock Hudson, Jeff
Chandler and, later, John Gavin could be profitable.</LD>
<LD>   Hunter chose the properties and developed the scripts, and it was
his feeling that women moviegoers preferred to see the female stars
suffer in beautiful gowns and jewels amid opulent surroundings that
led to the lush look associated with not only the Sirk-directed films
but all of the films produced by Hunter.</LD>
<TE>   The Albert Zugsmith-produced films "Written on the Wind" and "The
Tarnished Angels" got made because of the success of the Hunter
films, and it's worth noting that they had a harder edge, reflecting
more the different temperaments of the two producers than of Sirk.</TE>

<LD>Congratulations are in order to David Emmes and Martin Benson of
South Coast Repertory for entering their 40th season bringing theater
to Southern California. In just 30 more years, they will match the
record of another theater landmark, the Long Beach Playhouse.</LD>
<LD>   The playhouse, in 2004, will be entering its 75th year of bringing
live theater to the Long Beach area, quite a record when you consider
how many theaters have come and gone in that time.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, the Long Beach Playhouse doesn't have a
multimillion-dollar endowment like SCR, but it does follow the same
model of offering quality mainstream fare on its 250-seat main stage
while also providing more cutting-edge and/or original productions on
its 99-seat Equity second stage.</LD>
<TE>   The Long Beach Playhouse is lucky to have the loyal following that
has kept it in business for so long. Maybe in 2004, Calendar will
think about giving it the same kind of space you gave those
"youngsters" down in Costa Mesa.</TE>

<LD>Your Calendar article on the long-awaited movie version of "Chicago"
(Nov. 3) mentioned that the shoot took place in Toronto, rather than
Chicago -- or at the very least another U.S. city -- and that
disturbed me. As someone who works in the U.S. film industry, I've
grown weary of the U.S.-based film and television producers and
executives' endless pursuit of across-the-border "incentives" (a.k.a.
corporate welfare) to make American stories on foreign soil, leaving
U.S. workers (and many actors) behind while those at the top reap the
profits.</LD>
<LD>   In this atmosphere of corporate malfeasance run amok, of post-9/11
pro-U.S. fervor and of job downsizing, I have to ask: Are the makers
of "Chicago" so blinded by the klieg lights that they don't see the
big city they're shooting in is a facade, partially financed by the
taxpayers of another country? I don't think so.</LD>
<LD>   And what's with Renee Zellweger? A few weeks ago you published a
story about the Civil War drama "Cold Mountain" -- in which she
co-stars -- that was shot (mostly) in Romania. It would be different
if she making "Carpathian Mountain" and "Toronto," but those titles
don't have any clout, do they? Neither do we, the U.S. film workers
strangled by the bottom line.</LD>
<TE>   Where is Ms. Zellweger's integrity? Isn't she rich enough to pass
on such projects, or at least demand that they be shot in the U.S.,
even if it required -- God forbid -- a salary cut? How about
spreading your wealth to those working under you, Renee?</TE>
<TE>   The same goes for your co-stars, producers and directors, and the
numerous other rich celebrities who have made movies in Canada and
elsewhere when the story clearly didn't require it.</TE>
<TE>   While we still have breath, my colleagues and I will make every
effort to let the American public know what a sham these productions
are.</TE>

<DH>So says the man who throws his hat into the ring with
'American Candidate.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Reed Johnson</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With one election season just concluded and some presidential
hopefuls already floating trial balloons, R.J. Cutler, one of the
minds behind an upcoming FX cable channel show that plans to meld
real politics with "reality" TV techniques, is looking ahead.</LD>
<LD>   Geared toward the 2004 presidential race, his show, "American
Candidate," will recruit 100 people to campaign against each other
for the right to make a run for the Oval Office. Viewers will narrow
the field by voting losing "candidates" off the show, until only one
is left to challenge the Democratic and Republican nominees -- if he
or she decides to.</LD>
<LD>   Cutler, who produced the documentary "The War Room," a
behind-the-scenes look at Bill Clinton's 1992 bid for the White
House, shared his thoughts on democracy and the state of the TV
nation.</LD>
<TE>   What are you trying to bring to the political process that's not
already there?</TE>
<TE>   The whole idea of the American political process is that we're all
a part of it and it's something that we're all involved in. It's not
only that any little boy and girl can grow up to be president. Every
little boy or girl will grow up to choose the president. And that's
of course a significant distinction between a democracy and all other
forms of government. So our goal, in a nation where fewer than 50% of
the eligible voters are registered, and fewer than 50% of the
registered voters even bother to go to the polls, we're hoping to get
more people involved in the process.</TE>
<TE>   You must be hoping that some of the people who will tune in this
show will be the kind of people who watched and liked "The War Room."
Who are those people, and how will this show expand the audience
beyond that group?</TE>
<TE>   Well, it's certainly not just a show for political junkies. I
would say that most of the people over the last 10 years who have
commented to me on what they responded to in "The War Room" did not
talk about politics. They spoke about the passion of characters. And
they talked about the romantic notion of getting involved in the
political process.</TE>
<TE>   People who tune in are not just going to become a part of this
process in a passive way, one night a week, they're going to be able
to get engaged in this process all the time. There are going to be
candidates who they believe in who they can follow on our Web site 24
hours a day. It's not just a television show that we're creating.
It's our ambition to create something richer.</TE>
<TE>   Is there a potential problem that if we make politics so
entertaining, so personable, we'll forget to talk about the issues,
or we'll forget what the issues are?</TE>
<TE>   If we forget to talk about the issues, if we forget what the
issues are, there's a problem. That's not our intention. It's not
what we're doing.</TE>
<TE>   But even if it's not a beauty contest or a talent show, could it
end up becoming an entertainment option, or a consumer choice?</TE>
<TE>   It is a choice. That's the point. It's a choice we're meant to be
involved in. I myself would not like politics to be about a beauty
contest, certainly. But if this show can help bring about an
environment wherein the American public cares at least as much about
choosing its next president as it does about choosing its next pop
star, then I will be very happy.</TE>
<TE>   I would hope that this show will inspire an environment wherein
people are as passionate about their political leadership, as they
well should be, as they are about whether it's Kelly or Justin.</TE>
<TE>   If one of the show's candidates wins, do you get first dibs on
press secretary?</TE>
<TE>   [Laughs.] Not a job I'm interested in. But maybe he or she will be
invited to the debates. And wouldn't that be a wonderful thing?</TE>

<HD>More than just a kiss</HD>
<DH>When you see 'Far From Heaven's' Dennis Quaid locked in a
passionate embrace with another man, you know taboos are weakening.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lynn Smith</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The kiss didn't exactly come naturally for actor Dennis Quaid. In his
new film "Far From Heaven," Quaid's character, a 1950s executive, is
discovered, by his wife, sweaty and shirtless in a passionate embrace
with a gay barfly, played by Jonathan Walker. Both actors are
straight, and Quaid particularly has become known for roles as a
guy's guy in such movies as "The Big Easy," "Frequency" and "The
Rookie."</LD>
<LD>   "I was pretty nervous. I think he was too," Quaid recalled. "Both
of us were laughing, 'How about those Yankees' and stuff. On take 1,
we were sort of mauling each other like linebackers. [Director Todd
Haynes] said, 'Cut! You have to tone it down. This is a 1950s screen
kiss.' "</LD>
<LD>   "It took eight takes to get it right," he added. "After the third
take, when I got over the razor burn, it was just another day at the
office."</LD>
<TE>   It could take longer for audiences to get used to passionate
kissing between men. Women kissing women has become so common it's
almost a cliche in art-house and even studio films ("Frida," "Kissing
Jessica Stein" and the upcoming "The Hours," which explores the
effect of writer Virginia Woolf on three women in different eras).
But two men kissing still carries enough charge to shock.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost a last frontier," said screenwriter Paul Rudnick,
whose 1997 film "In &amp; Out" induced a mild hysteria in some audiences
five years ago with its long, comic roadside kiss between actors
Kevin Kline and Tom Selleck.</TE>
<TE>   The taboo against screen kisses between men may crumble as gay
characters become increasingly intimate in movies -- and as
high-profile mainstream actors like Quaid become more willing to do
whatever their characters would. The kiss "wasn't anything
exploitative; it was integral to the script," Quaid said of the
kissing scene in "Far From Heaven," which opened on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   As Rudnick said, American audiences by now have become used to gay
male humor and gay domestic life, whether it's depicted in movies
("The Birdcage") or on network television ("Will &amp; Grace"). But
physically expressing gay love is something else again. "When you see
two guys kissing, it pretty much demonstrates they're not kidding,"
Rudnick said.</TE>
<TE>   If any actor could take on a male kiss, it would be Quaid, said
Gary Morris, editor of the online quarterly Bright Lights Film
Journal. "People associate him with a certain kind of honesty. He's
not so concerned with his marketability to the detriment of his art.
He can afford to take risks other actors like Tom Cruise can't."</TE>
<TE>   Quaid's kiss in "Far From Heaven" is a particularly good one, said
Scott Seomin, entertainment media director for the Los Angeles office
of the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, because it's a
natural part of the story and not used for shock value. Julianne
Moore, who plays Quaid's character's wife, doesn't just find her
husband going out with another man in a public place, he noted, but
discovers them in flagrante delicto, actually embracing and kissing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's also a great kiss because it's Dennis Quaid. He's a
great-looking guy, not just an actor, but a movie star. I know it
tells other actors it's OK to play gay. There's nothing to be afraid
of."</TE>
<TE>   This fall, actors James Van Der Beek and Ian Somerhalder, playing
jaded college boys, shared a kiss in "The Rules of Attraction."
There's more male kissing in the current indie films "Love in the
Time of Money" and "All the Queen's Men."</TE>
<TE>   More ambitious than those smaller films, the $14-million "Far From
Heaven" is already stirring Oscar speculation. It brings to the
surface the undercurrents of homosexuality in the 1950s Douglas Sirk
movies ("All That Heaven Allows," "Magnificent Obsession") that
inspired Haynes to make his film. The themes of subterfuge seem more
obvious today knowing that Rock Hudson, who starred in some of the
films, was secretly gay.</TE>
<TE>   "Douglas Sirk dealt with social issues of the time," Quaid said.
"At the time they were hard-hitting but today would be fluff. What
Todd did was insert modern-day issues into a 1950s Douglas Sirk
film."</TE>
<TE>   A threatening image</TE>
<TE>   The reason mainstream audiences squirm when men kiss men, Rudnick
said, is that the general rule against same-sex kissing is far harder
to break with men than with women.</TE>
<TE>   "Two women kissing is seen as having a kind of sweetness, a moment
of friendship, and is fairly common in heterosexual pornography," he
said. But women are in general less threatening than men, he said.
"Men are seen traditionally as enjoying more power in the world. It's
seen as much more of a disruption of the world as we know it."</TE>
<TE>   The startling nature of a male kiss also accounts for a certain
kind of appeal, Rudnick said. In test screenings for "In &amp; Out,"
audiences seemed to enjoy the Kline-Selleck kissimmensely. "An
enormous amount of people said the kissing scene was their favorite
scene," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood has been flirting with different types of male kisses
for more than three decades. In the more experimental '70s, actor
Peter Finch unabashedly kissed his on-screen lover Murray Head in
"Sunday Bloody Sunday." The movie tanked. Some kisses were used to
reveal plot points or symbolize hostility or power (in such films as
"The Sergeant" or "Reflections in a Golden Eye"). The movie
"Deathtrap" (1982) dared to show a passionate kiss between Michael
Caine and Christopher Reeve, who played playwrights plotting against
a wealthy wife. "The people who produced the film determined the kiss
between the two men cost them $10 million," Bright Lights editor
Morris said.</TE>
<TE>   That same year, 20th Century Fox produced the risky "Making Love,"
a film about a closeted doctor (Michael Ontkean) who leaves his wife
for an openly gay writer (Harry Hamlin). One kiss between the men was
so passionate that it rivaled the famous surf-line kiss between Burt
Lancaster and Deborah Kerr in "From Here to Eternity," said GLAAD's
Seomin. "It's one of the best gay-male screen kisses we've ever
seen," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Straight audiences weren't prepared for it, Hamlin recalled. "I
talked to a lot of people who saw the title, saw the people in it,
and went with dates or wives. Then they got to the kiss and were
pretty shocked."</TE>
<TE>   Hamlin, who is straight, said that was the last studio film he
ever made. "The notion that an actor could as a person be identified
with a role he'd played was something I'd never considered. It never
occurred to me at that young and naive age. From that time on, roles
that involved young heterosexual men, active aggressive men, I
couldn't get a meeting," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some agents still warn young clients that gay roles could be the
kiss of career death. "We don't have a situation now where it's chic
for straight actors to kiss guys," Morris said. "We're not going to
get 'Star Wars' with guys making out. Not yet, at least."</TE>
<TE>   TV takes the lead</TE>
<TE>   Since "Making Love," no major studio has attempted to make "a
thoughtful film about adult men struggling with sexuality and their
love for one another," said Stephen Gutwillig, executive director of
Outfest, an established and popular gay and lesbian film festival in
Los Angeles. The small screen remains the vanguard of representations
of gay sexuality, he said, citing the popularity of cable shows
"Queer as Folk" and "Six Feet Under."</TE>
<TE>   Those shows, along with "Will &amp; Grace," may be paving the way for
more acceptance of a same-sex embrace. But major movie studios,
dealing with greater costs and the tastes of an international market,
still consider male kissing a liability, said Tom Ortenberg,
president of Lions Gate Films, which releases edgy, independently
produced films like "Dogma" and "The Rules of Attraction."</TE>
<TE>   Ortenberg said Lions Gate executives knew the kiss between Van Der
Beek and Somerhalder in "The Rules of Attraction" would be difficult
for some in the audience to watch. In the scene, Van Der Beek's
straight character seems to have a sudden change of attitude and
willingly responds to the advances of Somerhalder's character, who is
gay. Ortenberg said he hadn't expected to hear the collective and
highly audible sigh of relief let out by the test audience when it
was apparent the kiss was part of a fantasy sequence.</TE>
<TE>   "Fantasy removes it from the narrative," Morris said. "It's not
exactly real." Because it appears the movie is not really endorsing
it, it's one way for studios to deal with the anxieties associated
with male kissing, he added. Most simply avoid it. There are many
examples of what Seomin calls the "lost kiss" in movies -- scenes in
which characters would be expected to kiss romantically but don't in
such films as "Six Degrees of Separation," "The Birdcage" and "Wonder
Boys." Perhaps the most famous "lost kiss" didn't happen in 1993's
"Philadelphia," about a lawyer (Tom Hanks) dying from complications
of AIDS whose partner is played by Antonio Banderas. Banderas
recently said on Bravo's "Inside the Actors Studio" that he had been
willing to go for a kiss, but Hanks declined. (Hanks won an Oscar for
his role. His acceptance speech, which thanked a gay teacher,
unintentionally inspired the movie "In &amp; Out," which deals with the
impact on a teacher's life when an Oscar winner outs him on the
awards show.) Neither Hanks nor Banderas responded to requests for
interviews.</TE>
<TE>   While "playing gay" is OK and can even win Oscars, "most actors
don't gain by kissing unless they can pull it off as a strong
character," Morris said. "Antonio Banderas would be able to do it.
There's something unapologetic about him."</TE>
<TE>   Quaid said his agent pursued the role of the closeted husband for
him. They both wanted it for the same reason: that director Haynes
("Safe," "Poison," "Velvet Goldmine") is widely admired as a
director. "He's such a great filmmaker, and I thought it would be
done right," Quaid said.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think it would hurt my career at all," he added. "I'm an
actor. That's what I do. I reflect human nature and human experience
and that's just part of it. There are certainly a lot of gay actors
playing straight guys. Why not straight actors playing gay guys?" In
fact, straight actors have often played gay roles in films (Hanks,
Banderas, Hamlin) and on TV (Eric McCormack in "Will &amp; Grace,"
Michael C. Hall in "Six Feet Under").</TE>
<TE>   Quaid said Haynes chose him particularly because his all-American
image would be less expected and more interesting. "Someone said that
me kissing a guy is like Nixon going to China. He was so staunchly
anti-Communist he could go. I feel the same way," Quaid said. "I'm a
confirmed heterosexual who can go to China."</TE>

<LD>Seen Ray Charles lately? If not, it probably won't be long. In what
looks like a major push to extend the 12-time Grammy winner's soulful
brand, his name is attached to a host of projects coming soon to a
casino, TV screen or store near you.</LD>
<LD>   Popping up in Vegas, and on order across the country, is the Ray
Charles slot machine -- the first such device for the visually
impaired. In 16 states, Charles pushes Lady Luck in a different
guise, appearing in ads for state lotteries.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the skating world is offering up "Ray Charles on Ice,"
a revue featuring Olympic champs Brian Boitano, Jamie Sale and David
Pelletier. The show, taped at Staples Center in October and airing
Dec. 21 on NBC, has Charles singing four songs and accompanying the
skaters on the piano -- though not onto the ice.</LD>
<TE>   And by Christmas, "Little Ray," a $29.95 animatronic doll that
sings and sways to "What'd I Say" and "America the Beautiful," will
be on the shelves of stores, including 95% of the Walgreens chain.
(There's no "Ray Charles as Santa" wrapping paper -- yet.)</TE>
<TE>   "We're not reinventing Ray Charles," maintains Robert Pineda, a
manager of the singer since 1999. "At 72, Ray has done it all, so
he's concentrating on things he enjoys or believes in. Slot machines
make blind people more independent, lotteries raise money for
schools, and the doll is just a kick. He's getting paid, of course,
but the money is incidental."</TE>

<DL>Iowa City, Iowa</DL>
<LD>Donald Gurnett can't say exactly what it is about the sound of
whistlers that he loves, but he is more than happy to try. In his
office at the University of Iowa physics department, he pulls a tape
out of an old cardboard box and pops open a Radio Shack cassette
player from the early '70s. But before pressing "play," he figures
he'd better close the door to the hall, or else "they'll all say,
'There goes Don Gurnett listening to his whistlers again.' "</LD>
<LD>   Finally, the tinny speaker spews out short sibilants that rise and
fall against a crackly background, not unlike the hiss of fireworks
before they explode. It's the sound produced by lightning disturbing
the plasma, the charged gas that makes up most of space outside the
Earth's atmosphere. A beatific smile lights up Gurnett's face. "It's
like the electrons get together and whistle," he says.</LD>
<LD>   For 40 years, Gurnett has been recording whistlers and other space
sounds, and the very thought of them can send shivers down your
spine. Gathered by instruments he designs for NASA spacecraft, they
are the authentic music of the spheres.</LD>
<TE>   As one of the leading authorities in plasma physics, Gurnett is
emphatic about the scientific value of these sounds. His discovery of
whistlers on Jupiter, for instance, was the first indication that
there was lightning someplace other than Earth. But whistlers and
similar phenomena are also musically engrossing, as rich in complex
overtones and as unusual as electronic music. At their most alluring,
they resemble cosmic speech whistled through some great celestial
mouth with starry gap teeth. They are always changing; they always
surprise you.</TE>
<TE>   Gurnett's whistlers are no secret. The University of Iowa's
physics department puts sound clips of them on its Web site for all
to hear. And over the years, Gurnett has supplied tapes to numerous
composers who have requested them. But he can't recall any of those
composers' names, because none of them ever called back. As far as he
knows, whistlers never found their way into music.</TE>
<TE>   But now they have, and in a sensational form. Terry Riley's "Sun
Rings," a multimedia extravaganza for string quartet, chorus, space
sounds and video, was given its premiere at Iowa's Hancher Auditorium
two weeks ago. Written for the Kronos Quartet and illustrated by
new-media artist Willie Williams, it is the music of the spheres and
then some -- an incomparable love letter to the stars and the
planets, including our own.</TE>
<TE>   NASA commission</TE>
<TE>   "Sun Rings" appeared out of a series of chain reactions between
art and science. The big bang was a phone call -- NASA, in
Washington, to Kronos, in San Francisco. The space agency has a
modest budget for art; since the early 1960s, it has offered
commissions of about $2,500 to painters ranging from Norman Rockwell
to Robert Rauschenberg to represent the drama of space flight.</TE>
<TE>   But in the spring of 2000, Bertram Ulrich, the curator of the NASA
Art Program and a longtime fan of Kronos, decided to reach,
comparatively, for the stars. He offered the quartet $20,000 to do
something with space sounds, and he sent along a tape, culled from
Gurnett's collection.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew right away the composer had to be Terry," says David
Harrington, the Kronos' first violinist. Riley, the quartet's closest
collaborator, is best known for his psychedelically repetitive "In
C," and he's no stranger to imaginary space travel. His first string
quartet, written at Harrington's urging in 1980, was called "Sunrise
for the Planetary Dream Collector."</TE>
<TE>   More alien than space sounds to Harrington and Riley, however, was
NASA itself. So they traveled to Cape Canaveral to watch a shuttle
launch and make sure that they wouldn't unwittingly feed the
military-industrial propaganda machine.</TE>
<TE>   "The main reason we went to Florida was to find out what they
really do at NASA," Harrington explained late one evening from
Budapest, where Kronos was on tour last month. "But of course, like a
couple of kids, Terry and I really wanted to go to the launch."</TE>
<TE>   What they found were fellow seekers. "This quest for knowledge and
the desire to put people places where we hadn't been before seemed
like what I had been involved in for many years," said Harrington,
who has been the catalyst for Kronos' many multicultural musical
adventures. The astronauts proved "very inspiring and strangely
familiar."</TE>
<TE>   Soon, the chain reactions began to seem inevitable. The tape
Ulrich sent to the musicians was unlabeled -- it provided no clue
that the whistlers had a connection to the University of Iowa. But
because the school had commissioned some 45 works from Kronos in the
past 20 years, it was an obvious source to approach for additional
funding. Only after Iowa had agreed to be a co-commissioner did the
players and Riley discover that the sounds were recorded by one of
the leading scientists on campus.</TE>
<TE>   Upon learning about Gurnett, first Harrington, then Riley headed
to Iowa. After a day with the physicist, Harrington said that for the
first time in his life, he understood how the universe operated.</TE>
<TE>   "That night I called my wife and told her, 'I finally get it.'
'So, how does it work?' she asked. 'Well, uh, I knew a couple of
hours ago,' I said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are with him, he makes you feel as if outer space is
just around the corner."</TE>
<TE>   "He's a brilliant guy," Riley confirmed, "and a lot like an
artist. He's very creative and his general vibe is very twinkly."</TE>
<TE>   A common bond</TE>
<TE>   Truth is, Terry Riley and Don Gurnett share that twinkly vibe.
They are, in the nicest sense of the term, a pair of space cadets. At
68, both exude the kind of devotion to their work that makes them
cult figures in their fields. They even look their respective parts,
the unpretentious Midwestern physicist who does not stand out in a
crowd and the West Coast composer, with shaved head and long, thin
Mr. Natural beard, who does.</TE>
<TE>   On the stage at Hancher before the "Sun Rings" premiere, they made
a great act. Gurnett brought along one of his favorites from the
cardboard box. He calls the tape "R2D2." It includes the sounds of
phenomena known as "dawn chorus," which was recorded by one of the
Voyager spacecraft off the surface of Jupiter. The similarities to
garbled android speech gave the crowd a delighted start.</TE>
<TE>   Riley, suffering from lingering bronchitis, was slightly more
subdued. But he noted that while composing he tried to put himself
out in space, an attempt both men have in common.</TE>
<TE>   Forty years ago, as a student at Iowa, Gurnett heard his first
whistlers, and it changed his life. "This guy from the National
Bureau of Standards came out from Boulder, Colo., to give a talk and
play some recordings," Gurnett recalled last summer, sitting in his
office amid models and faded photographs of the many spacecraft he
has designed instruments for, going all the way back to Explorer I in
1958. "I found it intriguing and just decided, gee, maybe I should
try to build a radio receiver that could detect whistlers."</TE>
<TE>   All it takes is a simple device, so Gurnett, who had been a
national champion model-airplane builder, assembled the equipment and
took it to his parents' farm outside Cedar Rapids. "We turned out all
the electricity and stuff, and we heard some whistlers," he says with
a look of complete satisfaction.</TE>
<TE>   Around the same time, Riley, then a young composer and jazz
pianist in San Francisco, had his own profound extraterrestrial
experience. Just as he was struggling with the idea for "In C," he
took peyote and spent a night under the stars.</TE>
<TE>   "Suddenly I saw the geometry of the heavens," he insists, with a
note of awe still in his voice.</TE>
<TE>   "Stars weren't randomly placed at all but rather revealed an
incredible order, a perfect symmetry like a mandala. It was just so
apparent it dumbfounded me, and I wondered why I hadn't seen it
before. And I haven't seen it since."</TE>
<TE>   A short time later, he unleashed the pulse and patterns of
Minimalism, which would become one of the dominant musical styles of
the late 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   An inner journey too</TE>
<TE>   To get to Riley's home on the edge of the Tahoe National Forest in
Northern California, you drive through wilderness for a half hour.
The glass doors to his studio peer out into the woods; a brilliantly
illuminated night sky is available for the examining.</TE>
<TE>   Riley began composing "Sun Rings" there in the summer of 2001, and
his first impression of listening to the tapes was one of deja vu.
"You know so many of them sound like the music I was composing for
[dancer] Anna Halprin in the '50s and '60s," he explains.</TE>
<TE>   But after about three weeks, he got distracted. "Once the
terrorists struck on 9/11," he says, "I knew that there would be a
ferocious outcry for vengeance, and I was very saddened by it. It
seemed like this piece had suddenly become superficial, just about
NASA and space and shooting up rockets."</TE>
<TE>   A breakthrough came when Riley heard poet and novelist Alice
Walker on the radio talking about how she had made up a Sept. 11
mantra -- "one Earth, one people, one love." It suddenly occurred to
him that contemplating outer space could be a way to put the problems
on Earth into perspective.</TE>
<TE>   Riley also took unusual inspiration from the way everyone claimed
that God was on their side. "I thought about a prayer central that
would be like a big operating system up there that funnels all the
prayers from different people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "And that's what I have the chorus doing, they're all saying
fragments of prayers or ideas about love and peace, but then they get
quite jumbled and polyphonic, so you only hear fragments of them
coming out."</TE>
<TE>   As Riley expanded what was originally to have been a 20-minute
piece, Kronos decided that the work would benefit from a visual
component as well. The quartet's manager, Janet Cowperthwaite, knew
Willie Williams' video work for U2 stadium shows and gave him a call.
He was committed to designing the $7-million video projections for
the current Rolling Stones "Licks" world tour, but he squeezed in
"Sun Rings." It so happens that he is an astronomy buff and a onetime
physics student, "before," as he says, "I ran away to join the circus
and got involved with rock 'n' roll."</TE>
<TE>   NASA's $20,000 commission has ultimately turned into a $300,000
project. Williams culled images from NASA's archives to accompany
Riley's 95-minute work, complete with 60-voice chorus. To pay for it,
Ulrich doubled NASA's contribution, and Barbican Centre in London,
the San Francisco Jazz Festival and the Eclectic Orange Festival in
Orange County all signed on as well.</TE>
<TE>   As its first notes sounded in late October, "Sun Rings"
transformed Hancher Auditorium into a postmodern planetarium. Space
sounds swirled in the air; galaxies carpeted the walls and ceiling;
and Riley's generous melodies flowed through Kronos' four string
instruments. The audience sat in spellbound silence they way
spectators do at a space launch.</TE>
<TE>   The work's 10 movements were shot through with digitized versions
of Gurnett's whistlers, including ones that the musicians could
trigger. The score called for devices like latter-day theremins to be
placed on the stage next to the music stands. When the players waved
their hands, random space sounds were released.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, though, "Sun Rings" proved as much an inner journey as
a trip through outer space. As Riley peered through his musical
telescope, he also looked back at himself and his career, and
Williams always seemed to have an unexpectedly appropriate
illustration. In one movement, "BeeBopterismo," Williams synchronizes
projections of Gurnett writing equations to a homage to Riley's
jazz-pianist youth.</TE>
<TE>   "Earth/Jupiter Kiss" is a planetary romance with a heavenly,
drawn-out melody accompanied by seductive shots of the planets.</TE>
<TE>   In "Earth Whistlers," the chorus, out of sight in the pit, sings a
hybrid of Indian raga and Gregorian chant, through which the
whistlers majestically sail.</TE>
<TE>   The last movement, "One Earth One People One Love," brought the
work back home again in what may be the most mystically enveloping
music Riley has created during a long career of writing mystically
enveloping music. On the screens behind the musicians, Williams
flashed images of Earth from the "golden disc" launched with the 1977
Voyager spacecraft and addressed to anyone out there that Voyager,
now far past Pluto, might happen to run into.</TE>
<TE>   Asked afterward what he liked best about "Sun Rings," Gurnett
said, "All of it, everything." Asked what sun rings are, he said,
"You'll have to ask Terry."</TE>
<TE>   They are a poetic conceit, Riley admitted. And that is just fine
with Gurnett.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not supposed to be a science lecture," he said as he
turned to answer questions from the crowd gathering around.</TE>

<LD>They not only wrote the songs the whole world sings, they performed
them in "The Writer, the Singer, the Song." Hal David, Charlie Fox,
David Gates, Albert Hammond, Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil shared the
spotlight at the one-night-only gig produced at the Directors Guild
Theater for members of the Music Center's Blue Ribbon support group.</LD>
<LD>   "Hal David and Burt Bacharach have given us the scores of our
lives," said emcee Paul Williams as he introduced David, the
Oscar-winning lyricist who sang his classic "Raindrops Keep Fallin'
on My Head."</LD>
<LD>   "I thought of the first four lines in one fell swoop -- that
doesn't happen very often," said David, whose wife, Eunice David,
chaired the gala benefiting the Blue Ribbon and the Songwriters Hall
of Fame. After crooning "If," his high-pitched '70s hit, Gates said:
"If I'd known I'd be singing this years later I'd have written it in
a lower key." Also on the playlist at the Oct. 28 event: "Ready to
Take a Chance Again," performed by Fox; "It Never Rains in Southern
California," by Hammond; "You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling" by Mann;
and "The Rainbow Connection," by Williams. Performers Sally
Kellerman, Patti Austin, Leo Sayer, James Ingram and Jackie DeShannon
also thrilled the crowd with tributes. "Leo, if I could sing like
you, I'd be arrogant," Williams said.</LD>

<HD>Propelled by politics</HD>
<DH>Deeply personal reasons led three filmmakers to go where
Hollywood fears to tread with movies that delve into controversial
history.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lorenza Munoz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>POLITICS and commerce rarely mix in today's Hollywood -- you don't
see many studios rolling out prickly issue films like "The China
Syndrome," "All the President's Men" and "Coming Home." Sam Goldwyn's
old adage, "If I want to send a message, I'll get Western Union,"
rings truer than ever in today's corporate moviemaking.</LD>
<LD>   Defying that convention, some independent filmmakers this season
are offering a trio of intensely political movies. As spokesmen for
their films, all three directors have found themselves thrust into
unfamiliar roles, at times resembling history professors more than
filmmakers. The films, which probe painful episodes in the history of
Armenians, the Irish and Aborigines, have become historical
vindications, at least for the communities involved.</LD>
<LD>   Atom Egoyan, director of "Ararat," the first feature film released
theatrically that deals with the 1915-17 massacre of Armenians in
eastern Turkey, has addressed audiences at Canada's Parliament and at
the Library of Congress, where his movie was screened. The film is
being used by Armenian American activists to educate people and to
help push for official U.S. recognition of the genocide -- long
denied by Turkey.</LD>
<TE>   "Rabbit-Proof Fence," based on the true story of Aboriginal
children forcibly placed in state-run orphanages in Australia,
triggered passionate exchanges about past treatment of the Aborigines
in Australia's Parliament, newspapers and schools. The film's
director, Phillip Noyce, was in the thick of the controversy,
defending his film in newspaper editorials and questioning the
marketing strategies of the film's U.S. distributor, Miramax,</TE>
<TE>   He feared that highlighting the political elements would keep U.S.
audiences from seeing it: "I didn't want people to feel like they
were going to be lectured."</TE>
<TE>   And "Bloody Sunday," a documentary-style feature film about
unarmed Irish civilians killed by British troops during a
civil-rights march in 1972, has become a cathartic voice for the
Northern Irish. The film's British director, Paul Greengrass, wanted
his movie to help heal the wounds caused by the conflict. In a move
filled with symbolism, he secured financing from both the British and
Irish governments.</TE>
<TE>   Groups such as Amnesty International are supporting the pictures,
sponsoring screenings and panel discussions. .</TE>
<TE>   "These films are particularly poignant in the post-Sept. 11 era,
in which human rights are currently facing tremendous challenges on
an international level," said Bonnie Abaunza, national director of
Artists for Amnesty, a year-old Amnesty International program.
"People here need to see these films. If the films die at the box
office, their messages die with them."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Armenians want the world to see "Ararat," which examines
the effects of the genocide on a contemporary family. The film
represents for Armenians what "Schindler's List" did for Jews.</TE>
<TE>   "We have long thought of this as a forgotten genocide -- you want
the rest of the world to see what happened to your people," said
Raffi Hamparian, a member of the board of the Armenian National
Committee of America Western Region, a lobbying organization.</TE>
<TE>   The Turkish government has no official position on the film, said
Ambassador Aykut Berk, the consul general of Turkey in Los Angeles.
But the film has generated a lot of press in Turkey -- most of it
questioning its historical accuracy, Berk acknowledged. The official
Turkish explanation is that violence in the region was a result of
World War I and many people died on both sides.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, we don't agree with the content of the movie," he
added. "But it is the director's way of looking at the incidents
which took place 85 years ago. We look at it as a movie where
historical facts are distorted to please their own community." Berk
said he is not aware of any planned protests when the film opens
Friday. (It also screens Tuesday at the AFI Fest at the Cinerama
Dome.)</TE>
<TE>   In generations past, attempts at making a film about the Armenian
genocide have been quashed. In 1935, according to correspondence from
the National Archives, the Turkish government lobbied the U.S. State
Department, the Motion Pictures Producers and Distributors of America
(which also functioned as a censorship board) and MGM not to film
Franz Werfel's novel "The Forty Days of Musa Dagh." MGM eventually
backed down.</TE>
<TE>   Although exerting political pressure may be more difficult today,
economic realities remain a challenge. Armenian organizations are
trying to get their community to turn out on opening day by
spearheading Take Your Friend to "Ararat" Day. The film received
mixed reviews at the Cannes and Toronto film festivals -- and a
similar reception here could deter art-house moviegoers.</TE>
<TE>   The Armenian lobby is also using the film politically. Before the
election, Hamparian's group presented Gov. Gray Davis with a poster
of the film at a fund-raising event.</TE>
<TE>   In early October, the Armenian Assembly of America, the nation's
largest Armenian lobbying group, organized a screening at the Library
of Congress for nearly 500 people, including members of Congress,
State Department officials, diplomats and other Washington figures.
Activists hope the film will help persuade members of Congress to
vote for the genocide recognition bill, versions of which were pulled
from the House floor at then-President Clinton's request. The film
was also screened for members of the Canadian Parliament in late
October.</TE>
<TE>   "Ararat" director Egoyan recalled that journalists in Madrid asked
more questions about dates, details and books to read about the
genocide than about the film. At times, he has felt overwhelmed by
the weight of chronicling this story.</TE>
<TE>   He broke down and cried at the Capitol Hill screening after
receiving a standing ovation. "When you have so many important people
in one room, it is incredibly emotional," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Known for films such as 1997's "The Sweet Hereafter," Egoyan, who
lives in Canada, said he wanted to make "Ararat" more accessible to
mainstream audiences. "Every Armenian has this sacred responsibility
not to forget the genocide, much like the Jews and the Holocaust."</TE>
<TE>   Even if Turkey never acknowledges the genocide, said author Peter
Balakian, "the film makes a powerful statement about why the Turkish
government's denial of its past history is so harmful to Turkey, its
people, the Armenian people and the civilized world."</TE>
<TE>   Australia and Aborigines</TE>
<TE>   In contrast with Turkey's persistent denials, the Australian
government has confronted the unflattering events of its past.</TE>
<TE>   From 1905 to 1971, as part of an effort to assimilate the
country's Aboriginal population, the Australian government
implemented a policy of removing half-Aboriginal children from their
parents and placing them in orphanages. However, many of the children
never returned home and, in many cases, the policy wiped away
Aboriginal history, language and culture.</TE>
<TE>   "Rabbit-Proof Fence" is based on a book by Doris Pilkington
Garimara that chronicles the journey of three Aboriginal girls
(including the author's mother) from a state-run orphanage back to
their home more than 1,500 miles away. The title refers to the actual
fence that crosses the continent from north to south and was built to
keep rodents from invading farmland. To find their way home, the
girls simply followed the fence through the Australian Outback.</TE>
<TE>   The film is a marked departure for Noyce, who is better-known for
such Hollywood blockbusters as "Clear and Present Danger" and
"Patriot Games." But as an Australian, Noyce said he felt an urgency
to tell this story even though he knew that in his homeland, it would
land with a "certain amount of spontaneous combustion."</TE>
<TE>   "Rabbit-Proof Fence" helped reignite a movement to establish a
national Sorry Day that would include an official apology from the
federal government for the treatment of Aboriginal peoples. But it
also caused an uproar among conservative members of the Australian
Parliament who denounced the film, arguing that it was based on myth.
Major newspapers weighed in, publishing commentaries for and against
the film with one from Noyce.</TE>
<TE>   Noyce feared that U.S. audiences would be turned off by Miramax's
poster for the U.S. campaign. It reads, "What if the government
kidnapped your daughter? -- The true story of a family that defied a
nation."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Noyce's objections to the poster, the controversy helped
boost its Australian box office, making it the most successful movie
there this year. The film will be released in the United States on
Nov. 29.</TE>
<TE>   "Film is so powerful because it invites us to identify with the
characters on the screen, no matter how remote their lives seem from
us," said Noyce, who seems weary of the controversy. "That is
something that no amount of leaflets or government reports can ever
drive home to us."</TE>
<TE>   For many Australians, the movie has prompted a reevaluation of
their country's official history.</TE>
<TE>   "There are many, many Australian people who feel that the way we
have treated the Aboriginal people has been shameful," said John
Bond, secretary of the National Sorry Day committee. "There has
always been this conflict between facing the truth of the past and
trying to pretend it didn't happen. ... People recognize this is
something that needs to be healed."</TE>
<TE>   'The Troubles'</TE>
<TE>   Healing has not been easy between the Northern Irish and Great
Britain. Jan. 30, 1972, was seen as a seminal moment for what became
known as the Troubles. British troops' killing of 13 unarmed
civilians during a peaceful civil-rights march in Londonderry
unleashed years of sectarian violence that has only recently come to
a fragile peace.</TE>
<TE>   Greengrass, a British television director who also made the 1998
film "The Theory of Flight" with Kenneth Branagh and Helena Bonham
Carter, "said the events of that day deeply affected young Britons
like himself. He said he wanted his film, which opened Oct. 18 in Los
Angeles, to play a small part in building peace by telling the truth
about what happened.</TE>
<TE>   "As a very young man, I went to Northern Ireland and it had a
profound effect on me," he said. "It was unacceptable to me and
people of my generation that 400 miles from [England] this would be
occurring."</TE>
<TE>   The film chronicles how the day's events spiraled out of control
on both sides and eventually led to the killings.</TE>
<TE>   In January of this year -- the 30th anniversary of the massacre --
"Bloody Sunday" premiered in Londonderry at the Millennium Theater, a
movie house built literally on the ruins of the city's downtown. At
the premiere were John Hume, a Northern Irish political leader and a
Nobel Prize winner; members of the IRA; Catholic clergy; and
relatives of those who died on Bloody Sunday. Greengrass said he was
overwhelmed by the audience's response.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a strange and humbling experience as a British person to
take that film about that subject to the Irish," he said. When the
film ended, "there was no sense of anger, bitterness or calls for
vengeance. There was just a dignified sense that at last, the story
that long needed to be told had been told."</TE>
<TE>   Historians, newspaper editorials and prominent politicians such as
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams and Mo Mowlam, who negotiated the Good
Friday peace accords in 1998 on behalf of British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, weighed in on the film. Mowlam and Adams both complimented it.</TE>
<TE>   "Bloody Sunday" is currently traveling throughout the Republic of
Ireland with a mobile screening room so it can be seen even in small
villages that lack movie theaters. The film was released in theaters
and on TV in the U.K.</TE>
<TE>   "Britain is a wonderful place to live, but I am not blind to the
fact that we make mistakes and that this was a shameful day in our
history," Greengrass said. "You have a responsibility to tell the
truth as you see it. There is something about this little story from
a long time ago that speaks to us. It shows us how we in Britain got
it wrong. It's like a warning from history."</TE>

<DH>The president not working at home? That was unthinkable,
but the West Wing changed history, a legacy being celebrated on its
centennial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Johanna Neuman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>Washington</DL>
<LD>The West Wing -- the building, not the TV show -- has just turned
100, and no one would be more surprised at its place in the popular
imagination than its original congressional critics, who despaired
that the addition cheapened the White House.</LD>
<LD>   Compared with the over-the-top wedding-cake architecture of the
early 1900s, its design seemed so spartan that many in Congress
agreed with Sen. Jacob Gallinger (R-N.H.) that it looked like "the
offices of second-class lawyers and third-rate doctors."</LD>
<LD>   Aesthetics aside, many had difficulty understanding why a
president needed separate offices for carrying out the country's
business. Gentlemen of the time received business visitors in their
home offices, historian William Seale said, and "in Congress, the
idea of the president not working in the historic White House
residence was vociferously opposed." He adds that "the new wing was
so controversial, it was called the temporary executive office
building."</LD>
<TE>   But the $65,000 renovation project, inspired by Teddy Roosevelt,
who first worked in the new presidential offices on Nov. 5, 1902,
brought enduring change to both the mansion and the president's work
habits. The addition of the West Wing -- meant to replace the warren
of desks crammed into the second floor of the residence -- in some
sense "institutionalized the presidency," said Seale, author of a
two-volume history of the White House, "The President's House."</TE>
<TE>   At the very least, it professionalized the staff, helping the
White House evolve from a place where a president's nephews or sons
took down his correspondence to a center of high-wire political power
where generations of Sam Seaborn/George Stephanopoulos types would
gild their resumes.</TE>
<TE>   Stripped of its ornate Victorian decor, with its quaint 19th
century ways replaced by a quieter classiness, the business side of
the White House became a muscular bully pulpit for presidents and a
symbolic locus of power for the nation, later for the world.</TE>
<TE>   It may seem odd to celebrate the 100th anniversary of a remodeling
project, even such a famous one. But in this case, Seale said, "what
we celebrate without saying so is the 20th century."</TE>
<TE>   Modern sensibility</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't a given that the power of the presidency would reside at
1600 Pennsylvania Ave. over the long term. One plan, considered by
Ulysses S. Grant, was to move the residence to Rock Creek Park, where
proponents envisioned a huge presidential mansion with voluminous
grounds, much like those of the great European capitals.</TE>
<TE>   But, Seale said, Abraham Lincoln had "sanctified the White House"
with his handling of the Civil War. When two aides, John Hay and
George Nicolay, published a book of his speeches after his 1865
assassination, they were astonished by the outpouring of affection
for Lincoln's words. The public clearly believed that he had been a
great man serving a valiant cause.</TE>
<TE>   That perception helped cement presidential power in Lincoln's
final home, but it did not prevent repeated efforts to turn the White
House into a grand palace. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had
elaborate ideas of erecting an enormous building with courtyards and
a huge wing to the west of the residence. William McKinley approved
the plans, but in 1901, before work could begin, he was assassinated,
and Vice President Roosevelt assumed office.</TE>
<TE>   The White House had never seen anything quite like the new first
family. With six children, assorted cats, dogs, snakes, raccoons, a
macaw and one pony -- it spurred the need for a $500,000 renovation
of the residence. But first lady Edith Roosevelt, influenced perhaps
by a cousin, author Edith Wharton, rejected the Beaux Arts design
left on McKinley's desk. Seale believes she knew her husband was a
larger-than-life character who needed a less fussy backdrop.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a switch to a modern sensibility," agreed William
Bushong, historian and Web master of the White House Historical Assn.
site, whha.org. "This was the progressive era, with the city
beautiful movement, rise of the professions, interest in experts."</TE>
<TE>   Architect Charles McKim, a partner of Stanford White and William
Rutherford Mead, peeled off florid decorations, doubled the size of
the family quarters and, to the west, dismantled the greenhouses and
laundry rooms that rested against the house.</TE>
<TE>   In their place, he built the wing of offices that would eventually
house the main levers of American power. Seven years later, in 1909,
builders added the West Wing's Oval Office, although it did not
acquire that nickname, according to former Time magazine
correspondent Hugh Sidey, chairman of the association, "until
television put the presidency and the White House on a
world-encompassing electronic stage."</TE>
<TE>   The West Wing quickly became part of the lore of American
leadership. The image of a president sitting at his desk, alone with
power, has been burned into the American psyche.</TE>
<TE>   But even as late as the 1940s, it was not unthinkable to propose
moving the president's home to a new locale. Harry Truman, his White
House a crumbling mess of ancient plumbing, creaky walls and shaky
foundations, asked Congress for money to remodel. In response, House
Appropriations Committee Chairman Clarence Cannon (D-Mo.), went one
step further, suggesting that the house be torn down and rebuilt.</TE>
<TE>   Truman, however, like Grant before him, understood that history --
and especially Lincoln's legacy -- resonated from the White House
walls. The public, and presidential authority, required its
restoration. "As you know," Truman wrote Cannon in response to his
offer of demolition, "the room where the Emancipation Proclamation
was signed has a plaque on the mantle."</TE>
<TE>   Anniversary symposium</TE>
<TE>   A half century later, the White House is safe from the wrecking
ball. And at 100, the West Wing is synonymous with power and the
decisions that transform politicians into presidents.</TE>
<TE>   To mark the West Wing centennial, the White House Historical Assn.
is holding a symposium in Washington on Tuesday and Wednesday called
Workshop of Democracy. Along with lectures about the West Wing during
crises, panel discussions about the role of the press and an
exhibition of photographs, the symposium will include the world
premiere of "None But Honest and Wise Men," a documentary by L.A.
filmmaker Chuck Workman.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea was to profile a dozen presidents in a particular
crisis," said Workman, who specialized in documentaries about the art
world and often produces the film montages for the Oscar show. "We
chose to do it in different styles that reflected on each president."
So Truman appears in newsreels and John F. Kennedy's segment has the
look of a documentary portrait. For Teddy Roosevelt, the filmmakers
found silent movies, and for Lincoln they shot in an African American
church in Los Angeles, interspersing comments about Lincoln's import
with photographs of him at work. There are split screens for Lyndon
Johnson, interviews with the living presidents, and clips from movies
featuring every president from Michael Douglas to Harrison Ford.</TE>
<TE>   And recurring in the background are the offices of the West Wing,
the set of rooms that gave form to function and helped shape the
American presidency.</TE>

<LD>If still photographs of the few scenes of men kissing each other in
mainstream films were ever shot by on-set photographers, those images
rarely find their way to mainstream publication.</LD>
<LD>   The studios or distributors of "Far From Heaven," "The Rules of
Attraction," "In &amp; Out" and "Making Love" could not supply
photographs of the kissing scenes from those films. (Studios
routinely send out photographs of actual scenes for use with print
publications' reviews, feature stories and listings.) Some scenes
from older movies are available through archival research or from
unofficial Web sites and photo collections.</LD>
<LD>   Studio publicists said there could be many reasons such pictures
aren't widely available: Movie sets are often closed to photographers
when intimate scenes are shot. Independent films such as "Rules of
Attraction" and "Love in the Time of Money" cannot afford to shoot
every scene. Actors in the scenes must approve the photos released to
publicize a movie. In the case of the recent films, the kiss does not
represent the overall theme of the movie.</LD>
<TE>   Others, however, see only one reason: a persistent old taboo. "The
power that an image of two men kissing has to rock the boat is still
enormous," said Stephen Gutwillig, executive director of Outfest, a
gay and lesbian film festival in Los Angeles. "There is fear that one
image will blind everyone to everything else the film may be."</TE>

<LD>Lily Tomlin's eyes darted restlessly around the lobby of the Regent
Beverly Wilshire. Dana Carvey tested his material on a reporter. And
Robin Williams, just back from visiting U.S. troops in Afghanistan,
hid his frustration at having first driven to the wrong hotel by
dutifully posing for photos.</LD>
<LD>   It was an anxious beginning to an event that, on the surface,
seemed your standard black-tie, silent-auction, chicken-entree
Beverly Hills banquet. But the Nov. 1 benefit for the Scleroderma
Research Foundation, Bob Saget's pet charity, was instead a
bittersweet memorial for the group's late founder, Sharon Monsky, and
an evening of sidesplitting comedy.</LD>
<LD>   "Sharon ... loved to laugh," Saget said of Monsky, who died in May
after a long battle with the disease, which causes a persistent
hardening of the body's tissues. His sister also died of scleroderma.
"It's just the obvious flip side to such pain."</LD>
<TE>   A last-minute venue change, prompted by the guest list nearly
doubling to 650, left Williams roaming the Westside in search of his
stage. "I have found that putting on events like these actually
causes some diseases," Saget joked later. (Ultimately, the evening
raised more than $850,000.)</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, back in the lobby, Carvey, who'd had a long hiatus from
the stage, poked fun at his interviewer, a well-groomed young man
from an entertainment TV show. After a rousing impersonation of Queen
Elizabeth, he quipped, "You'll never use any of this. ... I'm just
using you to warm up."</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, Tomlin flitted among the publicists and well-wishers. As
she made a break for the ballroom, Ramelle Monsky, Sharon's mother,
stopped her. "You've gotta tell me how it is on 'The West Wing'!" the
woman said, referring to Tomlin's new recurring role on the show as
White House secretary Debbie Fiderer. "I lobbied to get the part!"
said Tomlin. "The writing was just so brilliant." Even the ambassador
to Belgium is a fan, she noted.</TE>
<TE>   In the ballroom, live butterflies alighted on orchids inside
tabletop terrariums as guests dined on the gourmet Mexican fare
provided by Monsky's friend chef-restaurateur Susan Feniger and her
partner, Mary Sue Milliken. Later, Tomlin, her jitters seemingly
gone, joked from the stage: "Somebody at our table ate the
butterflies. It's terribly distracting while you're eating creatures
that have lived" -- the main course was beef -- "to watch other
creatures fight for their last breath."</TE>
<TE>   During a lengthy (at more than an hour, some said insufferably so)
live auction, a few butterflies escaped their glass cages and danced
around the ballroom's massive chandelier, prompting the ever
dry-witted Saget to chastise the anonymous insect activists: "Please
do not release the butterflies. This is not a frat house."</TE>

<HD>Spiders, flavored slime and acting secrets</HD>
<DH>Emma Watson, 12, and Rupert Grint, 14, are enjoying their
roles as friends of Harry Potter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Stewart</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK -- Some preteen stars, the kind you want to avoid, are divas
in training. Some are picture-perfect.</LD>
<LD>   Make that almost perfect. Emma Watson, 12, and Rupert Grint, 14,
who play the title character's friends in "Harry Potter and the
Chamber of Secrets," made no missteps as they chatted up the second
Potter movie, which opens Friday. During a recent visit to Manhattan,
they were pleasant in the extreme.</LD>
<LD>   As he talked, Rupert, who plays Ron Weasley, filled pages of hotel
paper with black spiders. Then he began sketching a jowly, whiskered
man with a bloated stomach. Who's that, Rupert? Mr. Potato Head?</LD>
<TE>   Emma shrieked with laughter. "It's Rupert's father!"</TE>
<TE>   And so it was -- the father who was sitting quietly at the other
end of the table, not chaperoning so much as posing for his son's
unflattering caricature.</TE>
<TE>   Rupert offered no clue as to why he was turning his father into
Mr. Potato Head. The spiders, however, were easy.</TE>
<TE>   In "Chamber of Secrets," the wimpish but loyal Ron gets the fright
of his life from a horde of spiders, one of them a monster with an
18-foot leg span.</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't acting. "I was actually scared," Rupert says.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, vomiting slugs was great fun.</TE>
<TE>   "That was my favorite scene. I had to try out all these different
flavored slime. Chocolate, pep- permint, orange. They tasted really
good."</TE>
<TE>   Emma chuckled. Her character, the brilliant Hermione, suffered no
such indignities. But she does spend much of the movie petrified --
as in motionless. "That was a wax model of me. In the gap where I was
petrified, I went back to school."</TE>
<TE>   If Rupert's drawings indicated a hidden aspect of his personality,
Emma's were all sweetness and light -- names of her classmates in
balloon-like letters punctuated with hearts. Then she started a
second page -- girls with hair. How does she get her own
shoulder-length auburn waves to look so good?</TE>
<TE>   "OK. It's basically just wet it, curl it and bouff it up. My
hair's big, but it's not big-big-big."</TE>
<TE>   Her clothes were fab -- a fuzzy, gray cowlneck, a DKNY denim skirt
with a ruffle, brown suede boots. Is that how she dresses at home?</TE>
<TE>   "I wear a uniform at school, but I have these massive bell-bottom
flares, and my mom really disapproves of them."</TE>
<TE>   Rupert, his voice deeper than in last year's "Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone," kept it simple: black T-shirt, jeans, Converse
sneakers. Have Rupert's parents been good about his fame?</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, they've helped me keep my feet on the ground."</TE>
<TE>   Is he rich?</TE>
<TE>   "Kind of."</TE>
<TE>   How about Emma?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really know how much money I have because my parents take
care of it."</TE>
<TE>   Rupert, who is the oldest of five, is back in school now -- he's
the British equivalent of a high-school sophomore. The teachers play
up to him, he says, "which is quite a good thing. It gets me out of
some homework."</TE>
<TE>   Emma is into athletics. "I'm very, very sporty -- I ski, I fish, I
do field hockey and tons of stuff."</TE>
<TE>   How about academics? "Well, I'm doing art at school."</TE>
<TE>   Is she smart like Hermione? "No! I'm the complete opposite!"</TE>
<TE>   In "Chamber," Hermione continues to mix potions and cast spells
with precocious dexterity, but there's a human side to her. She hugs
Harry -- "embarrassing" -- and she has a crying scene. Was that
tough?</TE>
<TE>   "No ... you try not to blink for as long as possible. Then you
think of the saddest thing possible."</TE>
<TE>   But the sadness ends there. "I think I could be 100 years old and
in my rocker, but I'll still be very proud to say I was in the 'Harry
Potter' films," Emma says.</TE>
<TE>   Rupert: "Yeah, me too."</TE>

<HD>Aria for the downtrodden</HD>
<DH>J.F. Lawton puts an operatic spin on 'Jackson,' his film
about skid row denizens.</DH>

<LD>"The sun rises over Los Angeles. The city wakes slowly. An old
homeless man, Nemorino, his burnt face covered in sores, sits dazed
on a barren lot overlooking Bunker Hill. He nurses a big bottle of
Colt 45. As music swells, he sings Donizetti's 'Una furtiva lagrima'
(A Secret Tear) in a beautiful tenor voice. In the aria, a young man
insists he would gladly die to be permitted to comfort his lover."</LD>
<LD>   -- From the screenplay "Jackson" by J.F. Lawton</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   J.F. Lawton wants to make one thing clear: He is not an opera
buff.</TE>
<TE>   For 16 years, the veteran screenwriter, director and, most
recently, executive producer of Pamela Anderson's saucy syndicated
television series "V.I.P." has harbored a desire to make a film set
on the mean streets of skid row. But Lawton knew that chances were
slim that any studio would green-light a movie about homeless men and
women, no matter how rich the comedy or riveting the drama.</TE>
<TE>   "I would write it and say, 'This is so great,' and then I'd go,
'No one is going to want to make this movie,' " Lawton recalled
recently at his office in the Larchmont district of L.A. "I even said
to myself, 'This is a movie I wouldn't want to go see. Who wants to
see a movie about two homeless people?' ... Even if it's funny, even
if it's well acted, even if it's well directed, who will possibly go
see it?"</TE>
<TE>   And then a curious idea struck him. What if the men in tattered
clothes swilling Night Train and the bag ladies lighting crack pipes
with shaky hands -- those street denizens that society consigns to
the shadows -- saw their humble humanity soar on the wings of
operatic music?</TE>
<TE>   The result is "Jackson," a modestly budgeted, one-of-a-kind,
independent film written and directed by Lawton about a day in the
life of two homeless men. The film stars Barry Primus, Charles
Robinson and Steve Guttenberg with a cast of singers including
performers from the San Francisco and Los Angeles opera companies.</TE>
<TE>   The film, which Lawton said is in the final stages of editing,
features Primus as Donald, an unshaven, unbathed man living on the
streets of L.A. who connives a $20 bill out of a hapless businessman
played by Guttenberg.</TE>
<TE>   "All I have is 20s," the businessman tells Donald. "I'm not going
to give you a 20."</TE>
<TE>   "Why not?" Donald replies. "What, is it going to break you? ...
Here you are wearing a $300 suit telling me that you can't spare
$20?"</TE>
<TE>   "It's a $3,000 suit," the businessman corrects him.</TE>
<TE>   Once Donald has the $20 -- a "Jackson" in the parlance of the
street because the bill bears President Andrew Jackson's likeness --
he heads straight for his buddy, Sam, played by Robinson. "We're
going to go places you haven't seen," Donald tells Sam. "We're going
to do things you've never done before."</TE>
<TE>   Lawton, whose Hollywood career took off after he wrote such hit
films as "Pretty Woman" and "Under Siege," said it was his longtime
friend Primus who had encouraged him to finish the script for
"Jackson." But it wasn't until the dawn of the digital age that he
saw a way to make a film with studio polish on a shoestring budget.
"Jackson" wound up costing about $500,000, Lawton said.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I had to photograph it in a way that was extremely
beautiful, so I got Jack Conroy, who did 'The Field' and 'My Left
Foot,' to be the DP," or director of photography, Lawton said.</TE>
<TE>   By shooting the movie digitally, he said, his cast and crew could
operate in the streets in almost a guerrilla theater mode without the
cumbersome production trailers and lighting setups that big-budget,
mainstream studio films require.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone was working for little or no pay, Lawton said, noting
that he enlisted crew members he had worked with over the years at
"V.I.P.," who were all eager to take part.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to casting the movie, Lawton had to produce a
soundtrack album, one that, he knew, had to be on the highest level
for it to work creatively. But where would he find opera singers?</TE>
<TE>   One of the "V.I.P." veterans Lawton recruited was composer Frankie
Blue. Although Blue is an expert musician and composer, he admits he
is not into opera, but his brother-in-law, John Jackson, is a
baritone who once sang opera professionally and works as San
Francisco Opera's annual fund director. Why not ask for his help in
casting singers?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "A dangerously insane homeless young man, Don Giovanni, shirtless,
with stained pants, wild hair and frightening eyes, argues violently
with invisible people all around him. Down the boulevard, pedestrians
discreetly flee.... He flings himself down the street, hands waving
fiercely. Music roars as he bursts into the frantic and bubbly
Champagne Aria from what many opera composers (Wagner, Rossini,
Gounod, etc.) considered the world's greatest opera, Mozart's 'Don
Giovanni. " -- "Jackson"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When auditions were held in San Francisco and Los Angeles, nearly
200 singers showed up.</TE>
<TE>   "I hold auditions all the time, and I never had that many people
clamoring to do something in a movie," Lawton said. Many sang
professionally for touring companies, while others worked at ordinary
jobs and kept up their voices for the sheer joy of singing.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no idea there were people who loved opera so much that they
would take the time to train themselves to that high a level and then
never be able to work," Lawton said.</TE>
<TE>   Among those landing roles were Ella Lee, who made her debut with
the San Francisco Opera in 1964 when she already was the toast of
Europe.</TE>
<TE>   In the film, Jackson, playing an aggressive panhandler guarding a
subway entrance on Hollywood Boulevard, sings the Monologue of
Ibn-Hakia from Tchaikovsky's "Iolanta."</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost like I have nothing else in life and I have taken
over this subway entrance and you can't come out of the subway or
enter the subway without paying me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   From the outset, Lawton knew he didn't want a traditionally staged
operatic performance.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost every musical piece we are doing, there is something
unusual about it," he said. "We are having a very old woman sing
'Carmen.' And we are having a very young woman sing 'Madame
Butterfly.' And most of the people are ethnic, except for Madame
Butterfly, who is a white girl. We have songs that are normally sung
as solos being sung as duets."</TE>
<TE>   In the opening scene, for example, Richard Brown and Shawnette
Sulker perform "Una furtiva lagrima" from Donizetti's "Elisir
d'amore" (The Elixir of Love).</TE>
<TE>   Of Sulker, Lawton said: "She is this beautiful young black girl
with an incredible voice, and we made her up to look like a crack
addict. I put her in a burned-out car and had her sing this song. And
she said to me, 'I feel like crying,' even though the song is not
necessarily a sad song, but it has sadness in that context. I said,
'Well, go ahead, cry.' So you see beautiful tears streaming down her
face as she is singing."</TE>
<TE>   Lawton said his hope is that "Jackson" plays on the festival
circuit for a year so it can build word of mouth.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a film people will have to hear people say 'It's
good' about a dozen times before you drag yourself to the theater,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   When asked what message the movie carries, he replied: "The most
important thing is the humanity. Christ said, 'The poor will always
be among us.' ... That doesn't mean we shouldn't try to do things to
solve it."</TE>

<HD>A parody, all about a critic</HD>

<LD>A parody of New York Times architecture critic Herbert Muschamp --
titled, "Just as I Expected, These Plans Suck" -- is making its way
into the nation's newsrooms.</LD>
<LD>   The imitation, most of which is too sexually suggestive to print
here, paints Muschamp as a petulant, condescending name-dropper. It
begins: "Striding down the row of design proposals for the World
Trade Center site, balefully eyeing each inert mien and artificially
enhanced plan, I was reminded of the scene in 'Showgirls' where the
choreographer grimly surveys his topless charges."</LD>
<LD>   The parody concludes with a reference to a scene from "All About
Eve" and a promise that "my proposal for the site will be revealed at
a time and place of my choosing. Fasten your seat belts, New York."
Muschamp did not return a call requesting comment.</LD>

<HD>Mavericks bow to change</HD>
<DH>Alternative theaters, born to serve specific communities,
adapt to new circumstances by entering the mainstream.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jan Breslauer</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A theater of one's own: Since the 1960s, that dream has launched
scores of companies coast to coast. From L.A.'s Bilingual Foundation
of the Arts to New York's Pan Asian Repertory Theater to the St.
Louis Black Repertory Company, community-specific troupes have long
functioned as an important alternative voice on the American stage.</LD>
<LD>   But times change, and so do the politics of making theater. The
separatist ideology of the '60s and '70s that helped give rise to
these nonprofit companies has gone the way of much of the public arts
funding that nourished these groups. At a time when the line between
commercial and nonprofit theater has blurred and multiculturalism has
become a part of institutional theater rhetoric, there's much less
support for maverick groups that put the needs of a limited
constituency first. Where once they rode the tide of social change,
they now swim against it.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, community-specific theaters of more recent vintage
trade not in separatism but assimilation. They aim not to be an
antidote to the mainstream, but to become a part of it. A case in
point is Deaf West Theatre, which brings its production of the Roger
Miller-William Hauptman musical "Big River" to the Mark Taper Forum
on Thursday. Directed by Jeff Calhoun and first staged at the
company's North Hollywood home last year, "Big River" mixes deaf,
hard-of-hearing and hearing actors in the company's trademark style,
which interweaves voice and sign language. The co-production
represents the first time the Music Center venue has imported a
production from one of L.A.'s myriad smaller theaters.</TE>
<TE>   Deaf West's aspirations don't end with the Taper. The group is
also working toward a national tour and perhaps even a tilt at New
York. "It's just really the right time and the right place for us to
be mainstreaming," says Deaf West artistic director Ed Waterstreet,
who started the company in 1991. "We're hoping that someday we'll
have a deaf theater that is only for the deaf. But we haven't been
able to do that yet, because right now we've been very busy with more
mainstream work."</TE>
<TE>   Yet such a cozy relationship between special-interest troupes and
the bigger houses raises questions about an increasingly homogenized
American theater. Minority self-determination and diversity of
expression could be the costs if control of what's on stage is
consolidated in fewer hands -- particularly given that those hands
still belong overwhelmingly to white men.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in the theater it's our biggest problem when it comes
to the work of 'the Other,' " says actor-director L. Kenneth
Richardson, co-founder of New Jersey's Crossroads Theatre, which is
devoted to African American work. "The idea of the black or the Asian
theater is a thing of the past. A young producer who comes along may
be black, but he's thinking it may not be viable to have a black
company. "Why are we trying to shape it for this amorphous thing we
call mainstream? Mainstream will follow our lead, but we have to
lead," Richardson continues. "What concerns me is that these theaters
are all but dead. We can't let them die. We can't let go of that
mission."</TE>
<TE>   The rise of minority theater</TE>
<TE>   The social upheaval of the '60s gave rise to a related movement in
the American theater. Minority actors, directors, writers and others
who had long suffered a dearth of creative opportunities sought
empowerment by creating their own companies -- separate, if not
equal.</TE>
<TE>   L.A.'s East West Players was one of the pioneering groups. The
oldest Asian American theater in the U.S., it was founded in 1965 by
a group of actors frustrated by their limited opportunities in
Hollywood and commercial theater.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to break out of stereotypic molds we were placed
under," recalls Mako, the veteran Broadway and film actor who led the
group and served as its artistic director until 1989. "We wanted to
prove to the world and the community and the industry that we were
capable of doing more than that."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, many of this country's Asian American theaters, such as
Seattle's Northwest Asian-American Theater and San Francisco's
Asian-American Theater, were launched in the '70s on the model of
East West's early success.</TE>
<TE>   New York's Negro Ensemble Company, founded in 1967, was dedicated
to nurturing the work of black theater artists. Like East West
Players, it inspired a second generation of similarly committed
companies, including Crossroads, founded in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   The intention was to serve African American audiences and artists.
"When we started Crossroads, the idea was to serve a black community,
to create a company that would speak specifically to this community,"
says Richardson, who served as Crossroads' artistic director until
1988, when he came to L.A. to direct "The Colored Museum" at the
Taper.</TE>
<TE>   At the core of the company was a belief in a vital link between
cultural identity and creativity. "I come out of a black theater
tradition," explains Richardson, who from 1994 to 1999 was leader of
the Mark Taper Forum's Blacksmyths, a development lab for African
American playwrights and other theater artists. "It gives me a point
of identification. I know where I stand, who I am as an artist."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, there was disagreement over just how staunchly
separatist these groups were to be. Companies such as the Negro
Ensemble were criticized within their own communities for
collaborating with white theater artists and taking money from white
funders. And although Richardson and his collaborators didn't
consciously make integration a goal, Crossroads often had racially
mixed audiences anyway.</TE>
<TE>   The National Theatre of the Deaf, founded in 1967, is a touring
company that has helped the careers of many deaf or hard-of-hearing
theater artists, including Waterstreet. Inspired by his experiences
with that troupe, he sought to bring something similar to deaf and
hard-of-hearing audiences in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "When we started the theater, I was really surprised that there
was no theater in Los Angeles for the deaf, and the deaf community
really seemed starved to have that opportunity," says Waterstreet,
speaking through an interpreter as he sits in an upstairs office at
the Deaf West complex. "So my original vision was based on the
intention of developing a theater that was only for deaf culture."</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, those who first came out to support that vision
weren't the ones Waterstreet had expected. "We only had about 5% of
our audiences that were deaf in our first year, which was very
puzzling to me," he recalls. "So I expanded my vision to include both
deaf and hearing so that we could also include mainstream audiences
and artists."</TE>
<TE>   At first, Waterstreet encountered resistance to this inclusive
approach. "The deaf community initially was offended," he says. "So I
was very, very torn at the beginning, I must admit. I had to juggle
between my hearing and my deaf audiences."</TE>
<TE>   Funding goes mainstream</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Waterstreet has begun to win over the deaf and
hard-of-hearing. "Now our deaf audiences are 25%," he says. Yet he
has not abandoned Deaf West's hearing audiences. Instead the troupe
has catered to them, forging a hybrid form that includes spoken text.</TE>
<TE>   Partly, it's a matter of survival. Today it would be hard to find
the funding that launched theaters such as Crossroads, which was
started with a $220,000 grant from the Comprehensive Employment
Training Act. Says Richardson, "Figuring how much that would be with
24 years of inflation, where are you going to get that money today?"</TE>
<TE>   Funding sources both public and private are now more inclined to
give grants to programs that operate under the umbrella of mainstream
institutions, such as the Taper, which has development labs devoted
to black, Asian American, Latino and disabled artists. When scarce
money does go to community-specific theaters, it's often for
outreach. Deaf West, for example, is the recipient of a $4-million,
five-year grant from the federal Department of Education, earmarked
for a national touring production, a summer professional training
program and the production of videos of their shows. Deaf West will
use some of that federal money to cover its share of "Big River,"
which amounts to one-third of the total cost of the Taper production.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, it's a symbiotic relationship between the Taper, which
has diversity goals to meet, and groups like Deaf West. "If we go
into, for example, the Taper, we can also collaborate in other ways,"
Deaf West managing director Bill O'Brien says. "They have lots of
educational programs, and we can help open those up so that they're
accessible to deaf kids. We can send signers in there."</TE>
<TE>   And yet, for all the benefits of collaboration, there are also
dangers. "I still have a concern for this black theater that will
speak directly to the community," says Richardson, who recently
appeared locally in the Black Dahlia production of Oliver Mayer's
"Ragged Time." "If we did good work, we would hope others would come.
And now I think it's the reverse. We're too concerned about who's
coming and patterning the work based on that.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing wrong with a company like Deaf West getting the
opportunity to perform at the Taper," he says. "But how do you take
that step without losing the urgency, the artistry?"</TE>
<TE>   Concurs Mako: "My concept of East West or any ethnic theater is
that joining forces with mainstream theater is fine, but we still
have to maintain our own identity. He points to San Francisco's
Asian-American Theater losing its space in 1996 as but one casualty
of the changing times. "I don't think we've finished what we set out
to do."</TE>

<HD>The spotlight finds a searching soul</HD>
<DH>With his probing songs, Bright Eyes frontman Conor Oberst
is making waves in indie rock. But it's not fame's glare he's after,
it's enlightenment in the world offstage.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's midway through Bright Eyes' concert at the Henry Fonda Theatre,
and the group's 14 musicians have stopped their percussive,
orchestral attack, leaving singer Conor Oberst alone at the center of
the stage</LD>
<LD>   The crowd, buzzing from the intoxicating spell the group has cast
for the past half-hour, becomes quiet as Oberst plucks a descending
modal scale on his guitar, like something drawn from a haunted
Appalachian homestead. Whatever it is, it sounds serious.</LD>
<LD>   "Is it true what I heard about the son of God? Did he come to
save? Did he come at all?" Oberst's voice sneers and clenches in the
silence, a trembling thing groping for meaning at the center of a
void. The verses keep coming, a rolling, tumbling litany in the
manner of Dylan's "It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)."</LD>
<TE>   "They say they don't know when but a day is gonna come, when there
won't be a moon and there won't be a sun." A tense pause. "It will
all go black. It will all go back to the way it was before."</TE>
<TE>   The audience seems transfixed, and raises a cheer when Oberst adds
a line that isn't on the 6 1/2-minute recording, one about a nation
waging war for oil profits. Halfway across the song's bridge, Oberst
breaks into a full scream. "Could you please start explaining? You
know, I need some understanding!" Several drummers begin pounding as
strings and horns gather in a cathartic crescendo.</TE>
<TE>   You say you're looking for a new star? The people at the Fonda
sure think they have one. As for Oberst, well, he's not so sure.</TE>
<TE>   On the afternoon of the performance, members of the Bright Eyes
touring party drift in and out of the lobby of their Hollywood hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "Waiting for the big man? I mean the little man?"</TE>
<TE>   Matt Focht, one of the group's drummers, winks and smiles as he
passes through, suggesting that the little man's disappearing act is
nothing new.</TE>
<TE>   Finally the front doors slide open and in walks Oberst, an hour
late for an interview. He explains sheepishly that he had trouble
finding his way here after an overnight visit with his friends in the
L.A. band Rilo Kiley. Waiting for the elevator, the slightly built
musician looks even younger than his 22 years. His black hair and
dark eyes contrast strikingly with his pale skin, giving him a
winsome appeal reminiscent of "Malcolm in the Middle's" Frankie
Muniz.</TE>
<TE>   These days, though, it's more a case of Conor at the controls.
After quietly building a reputation in the breadbasket of the U.S.
indie-rock world, the Omaha native has leaped into major-league
contention this year with two ignore-at-your-own-peril albums: "Read
Music/Speak Spanish" by his on-the-side rock band Desaparecidos, and
a magnum opus by Bright Eyes called "Lifted ... or the Story Is in
the Soul Keep Your Ear to the Ground," both on Omaha's thriving
independent label Saddle Creek.</TE>
<TE>   There's a wide sonic spectrum in "Lifted," but essentially it
frames Oberst's folk-pop songwriting in boldly orchestral structures
built on a foundation of marching-band snares and bass drums.</TE>
<TE>   Oberst had drawn a fair degree of attention among serious pop</TE>
<TE>   followers for the records he released under the Bright Eyes name.
Much of the fascination stemmed from the fact that he started writing
and recording his introspective "bedroom pop" when he was 13.</TE>
<TE>   But with "Lifted," the door at which Oberst had been gently
knocking for nearly a decade suddenly flew open and the rave reviews
spilled in, along the lines of Blender magazine's ecstatic
proclamation, "The Ritalin generation may have found its Bob Dylan."</TE>
<TE>   Up in his room, Oberst settles down at the head of one of the two
beds, but a dentist's chair might be a better choice of furniture for
the interview. He answers questions squarely and thoroughly, but
without much animation, elaboration or eye contact, and he hunches
his body tightly, as if trying to curl into a ball.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't really enjoy [interviews], it's not the most fun he
has," says his longtime friend Robb Nensel, who runs Saddle Creek.
"But I think he recognizes that it allows him to be a creative person
and not have to work another job."</TE>
<TE>   The interview requests and other demands have picked up since
"Lifted" came out in August, but Oberst is clinging tightly to his
small-city, indie-rock roots.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as fame or something, I don't know, it's not something I
would ever consider how to get more of," he says, somewhere between a
whisper and a mumble.</TE>
<TE>   The title of "Lifted" suggests transcendence, and while the topics
range from boy-girl vignettes to knotty philosophical and theological
head-scratching, Oberst continually returns to a theme summarized in
the lines "All I know is I feel better when I sing / Burdens are
lifted from me."</TE>
<TE>   "A big part of it was just a celebration of playing music as a
physical thing," he says of the album. "It's something that is needed
by people -- at least it is for me and my friends. But I don't know"
-- Oberst's voice softens as he tries to surround the concept.</TE>
<TE>   "Just trying to understand, get some kind of clarity. That's
pretty much why I've written anything, 'cause I feel confused all the
time. I don't know, I'm kind of like absent, a space cadet or
whatever. So if you can write something down and it makes sense to
you even momentarily, you can have some kind of clarity.... It always
makes me feel better to write a song, sing a song."</TE>
<TE>   A boy who worried</TE>
<TE>   "Lifted" also branches into some social commentary, with Oberst at
one point uneasily eyeing a "cowboy president so loud behind the
bullhorn." One of the verses in "Day Is Gonna Come ... " begins, "Now
men with purple hearts carry silver guns / And they will kill a man
for what his father has done."</TE>
<TE>   It's an ominous, apocalyptic view of the world.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel, yeah, terrified," says Oberst. "And just really, really
sad more than anything.... I see pieces falling into place for severe
[stuff] to happen."</TE>
<TE>   It was ever thus.</TE>
<TE>   "When he was a little boy he would ask me if we were going to have
a nuclear war, at night before he went to bed," says his mother,
Nancy Oberst. "He did worry about the world a lot. He thought about
it and he wrote about it.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's sensitive in a way that I'm probably not. He allows
himself to feel that way. I always say to him it's his job to do it
for all the rest of us who can't really do that. It takes so much
energy, it wears you out, and he's willing to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Conor is the youngest of three sons in a close-knit Irish Catholic
family. Nancy is an elementary school principal, and her husband Matt
tends to computers for Mutual of Omaha.</TE>
<TE>   The oldest son, Matt, played in bands, and Conor, six years
younger, gravitated to him and his circle of friends -- well-adjusted
products of liberal families who resisted the pull of the suburbs and
enjoyed the more diverse area of their city neighborhood. (The
Desaparecidos album is a scathing study of the area's suburban
ennui.)</TE>
<TE>   With that environment, it was natural that Conor would take to
music. He and Nensel frequented a coffeehouse called Kilgore's where
singer-songwriters performed, and the youngster was soon playing
guitar and composing songs. Teachers had noted his writing ability as
early as first grade, and when he grafted that talent with music,
things clicked. Finally his friends talked him into singing at the
coffeehouse.</TE>
<TE>   "It was always apparent from the first time you saw him when he
was 13 up there strumming and singing that there was something going
on," Nensel says. "He's just a great storyteller and poet, and he
puts it all to music and kind of makes you feel like he can express
things better than you can about how you're feeling."</TE>
<TE>   Oberst released a couple of solo collections on cassette, then
worked with the band Commander Venus, launching a series of fluid
collaborations with Omaha's burgeoning rock music community. Boasting
indie-prominent bands such as Cursive and the Faint as well as Bright
Eyes, the city has become a key spot in U.S. independent rock.</TE>
<TE>   Conor's dad had exposed him to Dylan, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell,
Paul Simon and other '60s-vintage singer-songwriters, while his
brothers doted on the Replacements and Sonic Youth, R.E.M. and the
Cure. It was the folk side that prevailed in the melancholy
confessions of his three Bright Eyes albums (there are also several
EPs and singles), which evoke such elders as Elliott Smith and Nick
Drake, England's patron saint of melancholy. His great gift has been
to find the soul of loneliness despite being securely embraced by his
natural and musical families.</TE>
<TE>   The latest album may have brought him into the spotlight, but it
hasn't taken him out of Omaha. It's by far his best seller, at over
35,000, but that's modest by major-label standards. He recently
bought a house with two cousins and frequent collaborators. His share
of the mortgage is a little more than $300 a month, and though he has
a new van, he also drives a '90 Honda Accord that, he says, shakes.</TE>
<TE>   Not that he has any inclination to relocate from his hometown.
Nor, he says, is he likely to leave Saddle Creek, which began as
Lumberjack Records to release his first cassette recordings,</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have a problem with anyone that wants to be on a major
label, but for me their expectations of success are so completely
different than mine in every way that it's not logical to do that.</TE>
<TE>   "The nice thing is we can probably continue to make a living and
do the [stuff] the way we want to do it and I'll never feel like I
missed an opportunity or something. We've always tried to let it take
its most natural course."</TE>
<TE>   Now both Oberst and Saddle Creek are coming to a crossroads. The
label is trying to figure out how to deal with its growth while
maintaining its independent ideals. In one key step, the company
signed a two-year deal last week with national distributor ADA, an
independent operation with major-label backing.</TE>
<TE>   Oberst is dealing with similar issues on a personal level. All the
attention and new demands "definitely change things," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't get too worked up over it. It's just another force in
your life. Keeps me busy, keeps me traveling, keeps me doing things.
In that sense I feel like I've lost touch with some friends. And even
when you are home, you can't be as good a bro' to somebody if they
know you're gonna split in 12 months or whatever.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to know what to say sometimes when fans come up to you.
Just try to convey a thank you for being interested. 'Cause I'm
definitely genuinely thankful that they like it."</TE>
<TE>   "I think Conor's gonna be writing songs till the day he dies,
whether anyone listens to them or not," Nensel says. "He writes
songs, and if people want to hear 'em that's cool, and if people
don't then that's fine ....I don't think he wants to be a rock star
or a big public figure."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, that might not be his decision.</TE>
<TE>   A one-day-at-a-time schedule</TE>
<TE>   On stage at the Fonda Theatre, Oberst is about to create a moment
dead opposite from the stark isolation he conjured up in "Day Is
Gonna Come." As the sweet-and-sour waltz "False Advertising" wafts
through the room like a vintage parlor tune, his voice builds in
vehemence. The lyric describes a difficult struggle to remain honest
and pure and true to his art, something he's not sure he can do by
himself.</TE>
<TE>   Then a revelation comes in the final lines: "But I found in a song
and in the people I love, they will lift me up out of darkness / Now
my door stands open I am inviting everyone in, we will laugh until
the morning comes."</TE>
<TE>   Oberst screams the final words -- "That's what I'm gonna do," and
suddenly he's surrounded by more than 20 people who have materialized
on the stage, band members and friends forming a barroom choir that
boisterously joins in on the lilting chorus.</TE>
<TE>   It's a stirring testament to fellowship and possibility, and it
brings to mind something Oberst said during the interview that
afternoon, when asked about what he sees for himself five years down
the line.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pretty much on a one-day-at-a-time schedule. If I go beyond
that I start to freak out. I just wake up, put on my shoes, play some
music, drink some wine, hang out with my friends. Try to laugh as
much as possible."</TE>

<TE>   Backstage at USC's Bing Theater a couple of weeks ago, show time
fast approached for Benjamin Schaeffer, a lanky University of
Illinois computer programmer with a doctorate in mathematics.
Cradling a cell phone, Schaeffer eyed the numbers scrolling across
his laptop screen and checked in with dancer Cho-Ying Tsai as she
warmed up -- 1,800 miles away -- for a piece she'd soon be performing
with Chih-Chun Huang on the stage of the theater on the USC campus.</TE>
<TE>   Schaeffer, 32, explained that for the "Hummingbird" piece,
directed by Yu Hasegawa-Johnson, he constructed a virtual dancer in
the shape of a giant Peter Pan-like figure with wings, animated by a
flesh-and-blood human. Now, he was busy preparing his avatar for her
close-up on a mesh screen positioned on the Bing stage.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a dancer in Urbana [Ill.] right now who is in a
motion-capture stage, much like they use for video games or movies,"
Schaeffer explained. "During the performance, you'll see an image of
her clothed in various forms, and this avatar will be driven by what
the dancer is doing. One of these computers is shipping video back to
Urbana so the dancer there can see what the dancer here is doing and
they can interact. I set up the gear, and now I'm the machine
minder."</TE>
<TE>   In an experiment that gave new meaning to the term "tech
rehearsal," Schaeffer and nearly a dozen other engineers and software
programmers from around the country hovered over scads of laptop
computers, gleaming black boxes, mixing consoles and video monitors.
For this virtual variety show, sounds and images would be streaming
in during the next couple of hours from Ohio, Oklahoma, Florida,
Illinois and three California sites. The data would be routed through
digital projectors positioned at the back of the house and
transmitted to screens on stage.</TE>
<TE>   The only one who really seemed out of place was a toga-clad actor,
Isaac Taiber, who would perform later in the evening and looked as
though he'd wandered into the control booth for a downsized Apollo
space launch.</TE>
<TE>   The techies were riding herd on their data streams as part of an
event titled "Cultivating Communities: Dance in the Digital Age,"
which took place last month at USC in conjunction with the fall
Internet2 Member Meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Isn't one Internet enough?</TE>
<TE>   Not for technologists interested in the next wave of high-speed
network innovations. Created in 1996, Internet2 is a consortium of
200 American universities partnered with private industry and
government agencies, which are connected by a high-speed fiber-optic
backbone known as the Abilene Network. Completely separate from the
World Wide Web, Internet2's mission is to develop and deploy
"advanced network applications and technologies, accelerating the
creation of tomorrow's Internet."</TE>
<TE>   Today's regular "commodity" Internet, as it is known among the
Internet2 crowd, also evolved from a government academic partnership.
It sprang from a network devised in 1969 by the federal Defense
Department as a way for university researchers to communicate with
one another in the event of a nuclear catastrophe.</TE>
<TE>   Just as that alliance gave rise to all manner of unanticipated
commercial and creative uses, so will Internet2 one day spawn new
media forms that can be enjoyed by the public at large. At least,
that's what "Cultivating Communities" producers Ella Belzberg and her
husband, Benjamin Thompson, are banking on.</TE>
<TE>   "Within a few years, many principal theaters will have rooms for
all this equipment as part of the infrastructure of what is needed in
a theater," Belzberg says. "This research is going to be taken up by
professional venues, and the best models are going to be snapped up.
I think within a short period of time, you're going to have dance
shows across the country reflecting what took place at this event."</TE>
<TE>   The couple was among the renegade artists who founded the Actors'
Gang theater at UCLA in 1981. They hope Internet2 will shake up the
status quo in much the same way that the Actors' Gang's high-energy
aesthetic caused a stir in the early '80s.</TE>
<TE>   "The Gang was all about doing aggressive, crazy, fun-loving street
theater -- that was the edge then," Thompson says. "Now it's
multi-co-location, high-bandwidth, university-based performance
events."</TE>
<TE>   Belzberg and Thompson became interested in Internet2's potential
for hooking together geographically disparate performances about
three years ago, when Belzberg helped produce a conference for Steven
Spielberg's Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "That's where we met most of the players," Thompson says. "We
immediately began looking at how this wideband network could be used
to engage an audience, engage students and make the arts more
accessible. If the Actors' Gang was all about introducing this very
physical theater into the world, now we were going over to digital
theater and distributed rehearsal."</TE>
<TE>   Instant feedback</TE>
<TE>   Netcasts have been taking place for several years, but Internet2's
humongous bandwidth makes possible a scale of production rarely seen
on the Web. To demonstrate Internet2's mammoth data capacity at the
"Cultivating Communities" show, the Miami-based New World Symphony
performed excerpts from Aaron Copland's "Fanfare for the Common Man,"
amplified through an 800-pound amplifier the size of a bank vault.</TE>
<TE>   But what distinguishes Internet2 from, say, a typical satellite
television broadcast, is the instantaneous feedback it affords
participants, Belzberg says. "Satellite broadcast usually transmits
from one site and lands in another," she explains. "The real
advantage of Internet2 is that it's not a one-way feed. It's a
two-way feed, meaning you can interact with the people, so you can
have many sites working with each other together."</TE>
<TE>   Internet2's educational applications have already been exploited
in the form of master classes, which allow a professional musician in
one location to tutor students in remote sites across the country
during a single session. In the performance realm, artists and
engineers are just beginning to explore the potential for
Internet-driven collaborations. "Now you can bring in
geography-relevant theater, because if people are able to understand
more about a specific region, more about the rain forest, or more
about Middle America, or more about their particular part of town,
they may become more tolerant, more interested," Thompson says.
"Their eyes may lift."</TE>
<TE>   But before Internet2 takes off, Thompson says, two distinct worlds
need to get more in sync. "There's a learning curve involved," he
says, "and the first hurdle is that there's no common language."</TE>
<TE>   Bing Theater engineers, for example, were unfamiliar with the
"cue-to-cue" standard in stage productions, in which the tech crew
runs through each lighting and staging change made during a
performance. By the same token, old-school thespians might scratch
their heads when Thompson describes the "Communities" event as "the
most interconnected rehearsal ever on a U.S. campus with two
100-megabit legs on two separate V-brick streams on glass." (Roughly
translated: lots of information transmitted over fiber-optic, rather
than copper cable.)</TE>
<TE>   "The challenge," he says, "is to integrate the right brain and
left brain, the engineer and the artist." It will take time, he
admits, before Internet2-powered performances hit their stride as a
seamless experience. "It should be more than simply a layer. It's got
to be integrated. And that requires practice."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Faster than fast</TE>
<TE>   A typical "broadband" connection, DSL, may run about 100 kilobits
per second. A "starter" Internet2 connection may be about 100
megabits per second, about 1,000 times faster. The USC Bing Theater
connection was 1 gigabit on glass (fiber-optic as opposed to copper
wire). That connection, says "Cultivating Communities' " Benjamin
Thompson, is 10 times faster than a "starter" connection, arguably
making it the theater with the fastest connection on the West Coast,
about 10,000 times faster than a DSL.</TE>

<DL>Cannes, France</DL>
<LD>Americans may blanch at the prospect of picking a 2004 Presidential
candidate via the FX network, but as the world of international
television demonstrates, "reality" TV has not yet found the outer
limits of taste and ingenuity. Unemployed Argentines can turn to
"Recursos Humanos" (Human Resources) to compete for jobs, cash and
prizes. The Danes watch clairvoyants pursue real unsolved murders in
"Sensing Reality" (soon to be on U.S. television). And to sort out
their spiritual lives, the Dutch just got "The New Retreat."</LD>
<LD>   As the world moves to a new model for creating TV shows -- one
that continues to mushroom in the few short years since "Survivor"
burst on the scene -- many programs are getting their start at the
Palais des Festivals, the white convention hall that juts out into
the Mediterranean in Cannes (also the home of the annual film
festival in May). Outside, in early October, elderly couples
promenaded with their poodles, while inside the four-day MIPCOM
market, some 10,000 TV executives from around the world made the
rounds of tiny screening rooms, intently watching videotapes of new
formats to be adapted for back home.</LD>
<TE>   For decades, these screening sessions were much different: U.S.
studios made shows, and the world's broadcasters bought them and
dubbed them, with little thought to their appeal to local audiences.
Even flops found overseas outlets because they were packaged with
highly sought TV rights to the studios' theatrical movies.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s, however, viewers demanded home-grown shows, and
German comedies and French historical miniseries pushed "Baywatch"
and "ER" to less prominent times. But co-productions -- attempts at
making one program for several different markets, using, say, German
and American co-stars and an Italian director -- largely turned out
to be a recipe for mush.</TE>
<TE>   Today, with money tight everywhere, broadcasters have seized on
the model of formats -- mostly reality-based -- that can air in many
countries but be customized for an individual country's tastes, for
less money than it would take to create shows from scratch. Even
better, the shows appeal particularly to elusive young viewers.</TE>
<TE>   "Internationalization of content is sensible for broadcasters,"
says Rupert Gavin, chief executive of BBC Worldwide, which has had
hits in "The Weakest Link" and "Dog Eat Dog."</TE>
<TE>   That's why, at Dutch company Endemol's booth, with its full-sun
terrace overlooking the yachts in the Cannes harbor, some executives
were closeted inside watching a tape of a twentysomething trying to
see how long he could toss and catch a head of iceberg lettuce before
it disintegrated, part of the silly stunts in "The People's Book of
Records" pilot.</TE>
<TE>   "A good format is a good format, no matter where it is from," says
David Goldberg, president of Endemol USA, whose parent company has
brought the world "Big Brother" and "Fear Factor," and hopes to do
the same for "People's Book," the salon-set "TV-Hairdresser" and the
let-someone-else-run-your-life show "Master Plan."</TE>
<TE>   Not every program works in every market, however, for taste
reasons, or otherwise. A British show wants participants to try to
catch illnesses; several shows advertised gave erotic twists to
standard star-search-type formats. Goldberg says there are few limits
these days on what can be proposed. "You can't kill someone, but I
think people will try to do everything possible to that point. It's
not necessarily a good thing."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles, a culture-hungry metropolis always enthralled with the
new, has lately been getting an eyeful of the futuristic world of
technology being developed for art's sake. It materialized a few days
ago on the USC campus, where the Bing Theatre was transformed into a
glittering high-tech toy. It sprang up again last weekend like a
giant hologram in the storefronts and gritty back-alley basements of
Chinatown.</LD>
<LD>   Now we'll see how long the artists can keep their hands on the
techno-goodies. Because if history is any guide, it won't be long
before Hollywood studios, multimedia moguls and venture capitalists
try to tame the avant-garde beast for fun and profit.</LD>
<LD>   Funky but fast-gentrifying Chinatown made a fitting backdrop for
this high-stakes cultural drama perched on the thin, blurred line
between commerce and creative independence. Launching the eighth
Celebration of Experimental Media Arts, gallery owners, artists,
musicians and leather-clad looky-loos all came out to Chung King Road
on Nov. 1 to sample an open-air smorgasbord of video, CD-ROM and Web
site displays and installations.</LD>
<TE>   Laughing, smoking and squinting at maps while roaming the
neon-lighted streets, the crowd sampled everything from mixed-media
video narratives exploring ethnic and sexual identity themes, to a
cut-up of Chuck Heston blasting away at killer zombies in the
dystopian sci-fi thriller "The Omega Man," to "the world's first
memefest," a kind of cyber-symposium on how to subvert the mass
media, put together by c-level, a stealthy collective of CalArts
grads.</TE>
<TE>   The monthlong festival, sponsored by LA Freewaves and coming soon
to a gallery, college or billboard near you, showcases bleeding-edge
talent and technology that haven't yet reached the mainstream. LA
Freewaves, a nonprofit media-arts advocacy group whose quixotic
mission is "to liberate video and new media from the bondage of
profit," serves artists, arts groups and academic entities eager to
push technology-based art past pop-up windows plugging
penis-enhancement surgery.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge for these aesthetic pioneers is the same one facing
every generation of artists since the age of mechanical reproduction
began, Freewaves executive director Anne Bray says. From the printing
press to the camera obscura to the Internet, technology has given
artists new tools and cheaper ways to make and distribute their work.
The trick is to ensure the technology remains accessible once Fortune
500 scouts start sniffing around.</TE>
<TE>   As an example, Bray points to the proposed mega-merger of EchoStar
Communications Corp. and its satellite-TV rival, El Segundo-based
Hughes Electronics Corp., DirecTV's parent and itself a unit of
General Motors Corp. The merger is being challenged by several states
and federal antitrust officials on grounds that it would freeze out
competitors. It also could further erode the available cable slots
for the type of noncommercial work glimpsed in Chinatown.</TE>
<TE>   Remember the '70s utopian dream of video as a low-cost alternative
to film? Or the naive hope that the Internet would democratize global
communication, turning every man, woman and child into a desktop
Michelangelo? What is touted as techno-liberation for the masses has
a habit of turning out differently.</TE>
<TE>   That's one reason that in the late 1990s, a not-for-profit
consortium of 200 U.S. universities and research labs formed
Internet2, a high-bandwidth network encouraging long-distance
artistic collaboration. Although still in its infancy, the network
has mind-boggling possibilities for those who care about spawning new
art forms and spreading unconventional ideas.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine, for instance, a modern dancer at USC performing a virtual
pas de deux with a partner at the University of Illinois, whose
movements are digitally beamed to a computer back in L.A. The
computer then translates these motion signals -- in real time, mind
you -- into life-size 3-D images of a half-human, half-winged
creature, as supple and expressive as a Martha Graham principal. Or
picture Michael Tilson Thomas' orchestral brainchild, the New World
Symphony, beamed into your living room or classroom with concert-hall
clarity.</TE>
<TE>   Theory nears practice</TE>
<TE>   These fantasies moved closer to reality last week during the
Internet2-hosted demonstration "Cultivating Communities: Dance in the
Digital Age" at the Bing. If you were among the 500 attendees, you
saw how quickly the gap is narrowing between theory and practice in
the virtual performing arts.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're going to make a parallel to motion pictures, we're
almost in the D.W. Griffith days now," says Ella Belzberg,
co-artistic director of USC's event.</TE>
<TE>   Artists, academics, students and researchers have time and space
to keep tinkering with the model. Internet2's parent organization,
the University Corp. for Advanced Internet Development, is keeping a
tight rein on access to its network. Its goal isn't to wall off the
arts from commerce forever, but to keep the new technology from
eating its young.</TE>
<TE>   "The commodity Internet, when that was first created, that was
sort of the inventors' sandbox for research and higher education,"
says Ann Doyle, manager of arts and humanities initiatives for
Internet2.</TE>
<TE>   "As the commercial world caught onto the Internet, that was a
wonderful thing, and it also meant that the ability to be on the
cutting edge and explore and experiment, we lost that ability." With
42 million AOL users, Doyle says, today's Internet is simply too
crowded for certain kinds of creative risk-taking.</TE>
<TE>   The good news, Doyle predicts, is that the capabilities shown at
USC "will be available to the masses and the commodity Internet"
within four years. L.A., which is steadily cultivating an avant-garde
culture befitting a world entertainment mecca, needs to secure a spot
at the front of that line.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, must there be a territorial tug-of-war between the
avant-gardists and the corporatists, like the slugfest between
Napster and the music biz? Can't we all just get along?</TE>
<TE>   John Couch, director of communications for L.A.'s Museum of
Contemporary Art and formerly with Wired magazine, says there's an
art-world belief that commerce is suspect and artists should always
be fighting the Man.</TE>
<TE>   "But if you're smart, you're using the Man," Couch says. "You kind
of use a form of aikido to pull them in your direction. It's
dangerous to take a black-and-white approach, especially in
technology where nothing is black and white."</TE>
<TE>   Which doesn't mean that green should be the only color that
counts.</TE>

<HD>Now he hears the big picture</HD>
<DH>Octogenarian pianist Earl Wild says age has brought him
musical wisdom -- all the more reason not to retire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Pasles</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At 86, Earl Wild is often called "the last of the great Romantic
pianists." Born in Pittsburgh, he played professionally as a teenager
in the Pittsburgh Symphony under Otto Klemperer. He joined
Toscanini's NBC Symphony Orchestra in 1937, and it was a radio
broadcast of Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue" in 1942 that made his
name.</LD>
<LD>   Wild's recording career includes almost 100 recordings on 20
labels, and a 1997 Grammy for "Earl Wild: The Romantic Master." He
just kicked off the Rock Hotel PianoFest, mixing masters, emerging
players, new repertoire and affordable ticket prices in New York
City, and he plays next Sunday at Shumei Hall in Pasadena. We caught
up with him by cell phone when he was leaving a gig in Pittsburgh and
heading home to Columbus, Ohio.</LD>
<LD>   You were last in Los Angeles as a judge for the first Rachmaninoff
Piano Competition in April. That competition ended in controversy
because the judges disqualified Alessio Cioni, 23, of Italy in the
final round. Any second thoughts about that?</LD>
<TE>   Wild: There was no hanky-panky on this. It was a unanimous
decision. Except for one [piece], he was totally unprepared. He was
attractive and wonderfully naive and sweet. Unfortunately he couldn't
play. I told him afterward, "Go home, don't let yourself out of the
house until you're ready." He was cute, but it's not enough to be
cute.</TE>
<TE>   How much do you play now?</TE>
<TE>   Wild: Just about 15 recitals a year. That's enough. Traveling has
become so horrible, especially if you're tall. [Wild is 6-feet-1.]
You get into some of these airports it's horrible. I always thought
in my old age you'd be able to float from one to place to another.</TE>
<TE>   Do you notice differences in the way pianists play now and their
playing in earlier generations?</TE>
<TE>   Wild: I don't think it's changed. People don't look for the more
musical things. They miss a lot of the joy of music. But you don't
pick those things out of the air. That comes from being older. You
see from the beginning to the end of the music. When you're young,
you see things in sections. Putting things together, that takes time.</TE>
<TE>   You just played a recital as part of the Rock Hotel PianoFest, on
a bill with one of your students. How did that come about?</TE>
<TE>   Wild: Chris Williamson, the rock promoter, had been a student at
Juilliard. He had been a pianist, got into the rock business,
promoted Madonna and other big acts. He decided that recitals in New
York were starting to go downhill. They have the same soloists all of
the time. Not much interesting programming. So many old pieces of
music being played. So he thought of trying to rejuvenate them. He
has 27-some people playing on the series. He asked if I would do the
first one. I said yes, anything to bring back recitals in New York.</TE>
<TE>   I played pieces that I like. I told the audience I hoped they
would continue to go to those concerts and tell their friends about
them. Young people need a place to play.</TE>
<TE>   Some people feel that your technique was as formidable as Vladimir
Horowitz's, but you never captured the limelight the way he and
others did. Do you feel cheated about that?</TE>
<TE>   Wild: I don't mind that. Europeans who came here were very
publicity wise. I wasn't. I was from Pittsburgh. I liked music. I
loved music. People in this country were always very kind to the
foreign musicians who came here, which is all right. I was never
jealous. Thank God/</TE>
<TE>   What did you do in your long career that people might not know
about?</TE>
<TE>   Wild: I worked for Sid Caesar. He heard I could improvise, wanted
to see me. I didn't want to go. Why do that? It would ruin my
concerts. But he was such a good guy, a nice man. I liked him. He
said, "Play me some Spanish grandee music, I'm looking out of my
coach." So I played something. He liked it. He said he wanted to do a
takeoff on opera. "The cast, except for one person, can't read music.
How should I do it?" I said, "Take popular songs that everyone knows
and you put them in Mozart or Verdi settings. After about six or
seven bars, everyone would recognize the song." I worked with him for
about five years.</TE>
<TE>   Any plans to retire?</TE>
<TE>   Wild: Unless I have to stop, I certainly won't stop, and I hope I
don't have to stop. Someone asked me, they heard I'd like to die
playing the piano. "Is that true?" Well, it's better than going to
Canada.</TE>

<LD>Amid aging tunes, words that amuse</LD>
<LD>   "The Noel Coward Songbook"</LD>
<LD>   Ian Bostridge, tenor; Sophie Daneman, soprano; Jeffrey Tate, piano</LD>
<TE>   ** 1/2 (EMI Classics)</TE>
<TE>   Armed with meticulous diction and plenty of affection for the
material, Bostridge takes a break from classical repertory with 19
Noel Coward songs from the 1920s and '30s, arranged chronologically.
Daneman sweetly helps out in the duets, and Tate plays Corin
Buckeridge's elegantly turned, occasionally jazz-tinged
accompaniments.</TE>
<TE>   Coward's range is wide -- from the cleverest and most detached of
ditties, with plenty of delicious interior rhymes, to the
insufferable sentimentality of "I'll See You Again" (from "Bitter
Sweet") and disillusionment of "Twentieth Century Blues."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the music doesn't hold up today as well as the wordplay.
Ultimately, the most self-defining Coward song in the collection, in
title as well as verse, is "I Travel Alone." It's pulled out of
chronological order to serve as a fitting introduction to the album.</TE>
<TE>   -- Richard S. Ginell</TE>
<TE>   In brief</TE>
<TE>   Arvo Part</TE>
<TE>   Johannes-Passion Candomino Choir, Tauno Satomaa, director</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2 (Finlandia)</TE>
<TE>   Estonian composer Arvo Part's music gains much of its power from a
unique mixture of spiritual resonance and intellectual approach,
which seeks to align contemporary and ancient musical ideas. That
blend is in ample evidence in his 1982 St. John's Passion, given a
quietly stunning, lucid performance in this Finnish recording. It's
written in his mature style, in which time seems to if not stop, then
operate on a parallel track, making for an entirely suitable
meditative musical discourse. The performance is an elegant one, but
with a proper veneer of objectivity in the cool finish. Solo roles,
with Jorma Hynninen as Jesus and Topi Letipuu as Pilate, are smartly
done, but the sum effect is what mainly counts, and the short chorus
segment at the end is a typical Part-ian finale, rich in ensemble
sound, but also punctuated with sententious silences.</TE>
<TE>   -- Josef Woodard</TE>
<TE>   Holst: "The Planets" (with Matthews' "Pluto"), "The Mystic
Trumpeter"</TE>
<TE>   Claire Rutter, soprano; Royal Scottish National Orchestra, David
Lloyd-Jones, conductor</TE>
<TE>   **** (Naxos)</TE>
<TE>   The obvious hook for this release is "Pluto," Colin Matthews'
fascinating, recently composed appendix to Holst's "The Planet," that
takes over where Holst left off in "Neptune." Despite Matthews'
dissonant idiom, the supplement makes sense; it conjures up images of
meteor bombardments, swirling solar winds and other effects that
suggest a plunge into the unknown terrors and splendors of outer
space. This is the second recording of "Pluto" but the first at a
bargain price, and it is fortuitously attached to an outstanding
performance of the original "Planets," astutely paced, full of
vehemence and mystery, superbly recorded. You also get an early Holst
rarity, "The Mystic Trumpeter," an 18-minute setting of Walt
Whitman's words that looks backward to Wagner and forward to "The
Planets." For those who don't mind a challenge to tradition, this is
a must-buy.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a terrifying tale.</LD>
<LD>   Anna Politkovskaya, special correspondent for the Moscow biweekly
newspaper Novaya Gazeta, has made more than 40 trips to Chechnya over
the past three years to report on Russian military action there. Last
year, while investigating charges that Russian soldiers were
torturing Chechen civilians, she was arrested by the Russian
military, held for three days and threatened with rape and execution.
Seven months later, when Moscow said Chechen rebels had shot down a
helicopter carrying the staff of a federal commission, she wrote that
the Russian military was actually responsible. More threats on her
life soon followed.</LD>
<LD>   Politkovskaya's children have also been threatened, her husband
has left her, and she was even forced -- amid new threats, and
despite hiring a bodyguard -- to leave Russia. But after two months
in Vienna, she returned to Russia last December and continues to
write about Chechnya, personal danger notwithstanding.</LD>
<TE>   Politkovskaya was in Los Angeles recently to accept a Courage in
Journalism award from the International Women's Media Foundation,
which honors women who have risked their lives -- and, often, their
families' lives -- to bring news of violence, corruption and
repression to the world's attention.</TE>
<TE>   It's the kind of work -- the kind of risk-taking -- that we will
all see again, with more familiar names attached, should President
Bush follow through his threats to make war on Iraq. That realization
-- and the presence at the podium of the parents of Daniel Pearl, the
Wall Street Journal reporter killed in Pakistan early this year --
made the Courage in Journalism program last month all the more
chilling.</TE>
<TE>   So did the unexpected absence of Politkovskaya herself, who'd been
in Los Angeles for two days but had suddenly returned to Russia to
face danger anew. At 7 o'clock on the morning of the program, she
flew back to Moscow, her presence there having been urgently
requested by Chechen rebels who wanted her help in negotiating their
demands for peace in Chechnya in exchange for the release of the
hundreds of hostages they were holding in a Moscow theater.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Politkovskaya nor anyone else was able to resolve the
standoff before Russian troops gassed the rebels and their hostages
and stormed the theater, leaving more than 100 dead. But
Politkovskaya, who had won the trust of the Chechens during her
reporting there, had hoped she could make a difference.</TE>
<TE>   "I have always believed that Russian journalism, first and
foremost, is the journalism of action," she said in a message read to
the Courage in Journalism audience.</TE>
<TE>   Politkovskaya always saw her job as questioning, as doubting
official government versions -- seeking the truth, no matter the
personal risk, and that's what gave her, she said, "no choice" but to
fly to Moscow. That's also what bound her to other Courage in
Journalism honorees this year and in previous years.</TE>
<TE>   The other two winners this year were Sandra Nyaira, who's faced
death threats and lawsuits while investigating the corrupt regime of
Robert Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe; and Kathy Gannon, the
Associated Press bureau chief in Islamabad and the only Western
reporter allowed into Kabul for more than two weeks in the first
month after 9/11.</TE>
<TE>   Previous winners of the award have encountered equally menacing
obstacles -- in Algeria and Afghanistan, in Spain and the Sudan, in
Kosovo and Kenya and Kyrgyzstan. Jineth Bedoya Lima, one of last
year's honorees, covers the conflict between the Colombian government
and paramilitary groups for El Espectador, a daily newspaper in
Bogota, Colombia. Five months before her appearance at the ceremony
in Los Angeles, Lima was kidnapped at gunpoint, drugged, brutally
beaten and repeatedly raped. A taxi driver found her that night in a
garbage dump, where she had been left with her hands tied.</TE>
<TE>   The consequences of war</TE>
<TE>   As America gears up for possible war in Iraq, it's worth
remembering the risks these journalists have taken -- and the risks
their colleagues, men and women alike, will almost inevitably face if
President Bush persists with his plan to forcefully disarm Iraq and
oust Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Ten journalists -- Pearl among them -- were killed during the war
in Afghanistan last year, and more than a dozen others were robbed,
arrested, kidnapped or shot at. At one time, there were widespread
reports that Taliban leaders had offered a bounty of $50,000 to
$100,000 to anyone who killed a Western journalist.</TE>
<TE>   It's not likely to be any safer for journalists in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   To report accurately in a war zone -- mindful all the while of the
age-old journalistic lament that during wartime, "truth is the first
casualty" -- many journalists push the envelope on personal safety.
Most likely, some will die if we attack Iraq -- as more than 700
journalists have died covering past wars. Despite repeated warnings
from their editors that no story is worth dying for, they will take
risks in pursuit of stories and pictures</TE>
<TE>   They won't do so because they're fools or daredevils. Oh sure,
there's an undeniable sense of adventure, and there are always a few
cowboys of the Geraldo Rivera type, men who risk (or want to appear
to be risking) life and limb to call attention to their own heroism
or win an award or get a Page 1 byline or an on-screen exclusive.</TE>
<TE>   But the vast majority of war correspondents who put themselves in
harm's way do so because -- as Paul Watson, a Times foreign
correspondent, told me last year, from Afghanistan -- "If the story
of the war is important enough to bring it to the public's attention,
it's worth the risk to the journalist who brings it to them."</TE>
<TE>   Watson figures he's covered more than a dozen wars on four
continents. In Bosnia, he says, he was "bombed by Americans, shot at
by Albanians and threatened by Serbs on an almost daily basis." He
was also targeted by Serb mortar fire.</TE>
<TE>   But Watson keeps coming back to war, in part because he feels he
owes it to those journalists who have been killed in combat, killed
while pursuing important stories, stories on horrors and atrocities
they thought the world should know about.</TE>
<TE>   That desire to inform, to bear witness to unbearable tragedy, is
what has driven the women who have won the Courage in Journalism
awards, and it's what drives war correspondents everywhere.</TE>

<HD>Ceramist's trip to Russia now has a glaze of politics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Haithman</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Karen Koblitz, a West Los Angeles ceramist, tried hard to keep world
politics from intruding on her recent trip to Moscow as part of one
of the first group of artists to journey to other countries for the
U.S. State Department's Art in Embassies Program.</LD>
<LD>   The program has been placing U.S. citizens' original artworks into
diplomatic residences worldwide for 36 years. But this year marks the
first time the program has paid for five artists and one art
historian to travel with their works. "I considered myself an art
ambassador; I wasn't there to get into the political arena," says
Koblitz, 51. But she admits that in recent days, acquaintances have
not been asking her about Russian ceramics and tile, but about
whether she had gone to the infamous Moscow theater where more than
750 hostages were recently held by Chechen guerrillas; nearly 120
died after inhaling a gas used by Russian forces during a rescue
attempt. Koblitz returned to the U.S. on Oct. 6, more than two weeks
before the standoff, but some frantic friends weren't sure whether
she was still overseas.</LD>
<TE>   Koblitz did indeed go to the theater, a different theater, during
her Sept.23-Oct. 6 visit. She went to the star-studded premiere of a
Russian production of "Chicago" with Lisa Vershbow, wife of American
Ambassador Alexander Vershbow. But upon returning home, she was
saddened to learn that Alexander Karpov, 31, who had translated
"Chicago" into Russian, was among those killed by the gas.</TE>
<TE>   During the trip, Koblitz found the Russian art community as eager
as she was to avoid talking politics. With a translator as her
constant companion, she lectured at Moscow's Stroganov Art School and
at Spaso House, the ambassador's residence; toured the city; and
visited historic landmarks decorated with intricate tile.</TE>
<TE>   The question "Where do I find the hot ceramic artists in Russia?"
led her just outside the city to a place called the Experimental
Creative Production Factory of the Union of Artists of Russia.
Artists on the two lower floors toiled to create "not very strong
commercial ceramics," but the upper floor was reserved for
artists-in-residence doing exciting experimental work.</TE>
<TE>   Koblitz, a faculty member of the USC art department, will talk
about art, not politics, at noon Monday at Watt Hall on the USC
campus, and show slides of her trip. The discussion is open to the
public.</TE>

<LD>Ballet dancers have long performed in the homes of their benefactors,
and on Tuesday former Kirov principal Irina Chistyakova joined the
list.</LD>
<LD>   In a fund-raising event supporting the creation of the American
Vaganova Ballet Conservatory (a local academy that aims to duplicate
the Kirov's famed training system in St. Petersburg), Chistyakova
danced "The Dying Swan" and the Russian Dance from "Swan Lake" in the
Beverly Hills home of real estate developer Richard Rand.</LD>
<LD>   The planned academy is a project of Nadya and Golden Koscuik's
West Coast Classical Ballet Society, which for more than five years
has been attempting to establish a professional Russian-style ballet
company in the Southland. The Koscuiks say that their academy plans
to develop dancers who will graduate into the company, once it
exists, and join guests they will bring from Russia.</LD>
<TE>   Teachers from St. Petersburg will be joining the Koscuiks later
this year and early in 2003. A performance involving Chistyakova is
scheduled for Dec. 20 at UCLA's Freud Playhouse.</TE>

<LD>About 7,000 theatergoers attended 48 performances and special events
that were part of last month's Edge of the World Theater Festival,
according to festival organizers' estimates, which were based on
attendance reports from some of the participating small theaters.</LD>
<LD>   About 500 theatergoers bought $15 "passports" to the L.A. festival
-- almost twice as many as last year -- and another 100 were given
away to people who couldn't afford them.</LD>
<LD>   Co-executive director Ray Simmons said that the festival will
expand by five days next year, running Oct. 4-19, 2003, and will
feature "a much more aggressive curatorial approach" -- a direction
that was apparent this year. "Everybody felt the quality was better
this year," he said, although he also noted that "there were a few
splendid failures -- shows that sounded like good concepts but didn't
quite come off. There was no way to know it in advance."</LD>
<TE>   The festival's attempt to expand beyond its core
Hollywood-downtown area by using more far-flung venues for
round-table discussions "didn't work so well," with outlying events
attracting few participants.</TE>

<LD>   "Neva Dinova" (Crank!)</LD>
<LD>   *** 1/2</LD>
<TE>   Reaching the crest of the title track of "The Execution of All
Things," Jenny Lewis of the Los Angeles band Rilo Kiley sings: "Then
we'll go to Omaha, to work and exploit the booming music scene...."
Whether her tone is earnestly hopeful or sweetly ironic, that's
exactly what Rilo Kiley did, signing to indie label Saddle Creek and
recording its engaging second album in Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   Out of the same city and recording studio (but via an L.A. indie
label) comes Neva Dinova, whose self-titled album marries
three-guitar atmospherics with Jake Bellows' compelling poetry to
form a nearly perfect union of sonic saccharine and lyrical snap.</TE>
<TE>   "Brooklyn," for instance, warbles like a lovely Wilco ballad, its
narrator innocently recounting his pursuit of a girl he saw on the
subway. By song's end, you realize it's stalking, plain and simple,
and the narrator Just Doesn't Get It. Then there is the delicate
"Dances Fantastic" and its sleights-of-rhyme, like: "[she] broke my
heart and out poured oil / I don't want that kind of goil."</TE>
<TE>   Neva Dinova invokes its effects sparingly -- barbed-wire guitars
only as exclamation points, gauzy swells of distortion to build
drama. You hear the reverb-soaked "Did You Disappoint Your God?" or
the poignant "Jesus' Choir," and you wonder, what's in the water in
Omaha?</TE>

<HD>Undiscovered? Not for long</HD>
<DH>As Hammer Projects curator, James Elaine shines a spotlight
on talented young artists, many of whom haven't had a museum show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hunter Drohojowska-Philp</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sitting on the patio of the UCLA Hammer Museum, James Elaine hunches
forward in his chair, his pale blue eyes turning serious as he says,
"This is not a career choice. This is my passion."</LD>
<LD>   Elaine is curator of Hammer Projects at the Westwood museum, and
since his 1999 arrival he has established this exhibition program as
one of the most adventuresome in Southern California. Hammer Projects
is dedicated to exhibiting the work of young artists, many of whom
have never had a museum show.</LD>
<LD>   Elaine, 51, is a striking presence with wiry gray hair and prone
to wearing exotic cowboy boots. "I am an artist," he explains with a
slight Texas drawl. "I think I have a different perspective from an
academic. I think of artists as my peers. I'm comfortable in their
studios. It's something I love."</LD>
<TE>   In the past three years, Elaine has arranged shows for 28 artists
under the age of 40. "I don't think there is another museum in L.A.
doing what we are doing the way we are doing it," he says. "We made a
conscious decision that it was important for the Hammer in creating
its own identity to give ourselves up to younger artists and to bring
an audience here who had never set foot in the building before."</TE>
<TE>   The Hammer houses the Old Master and 19th century paintings and
drawings assembled by the late founder of Occidental Petroleum,
Armand Hammer, as well as the Grunwald Center for the Graphic Arts,
with some 40,000 works on paper dating from the Renaissance to the
present.</TE>
<TE>   Hammer Projects represents a philosophical decision by the museum
director and curators to integrate the often segregated worlds of
contemporary and historical visual art. For example, over the summer,
the late paintings of Modernist Milton Avery were shown in the main
gallery while the comic book-inspired mural of Aaron Noble adorned
the lobby wall. Hammer Museum director Ann Philbin says, "These are
areas I'm comfortable in, from the historical work to the
up-to-the-minute contemporary."</TE>
<TE>   And the lobby-wall-as-gallery is another philosophical decision --
the result of turning an architectural liability into an asset. In
1990, Edward Larrabee Barnes had designed an extremely formal museum
to show Hammer's personal collection. From the main entrance, a
capacious marble-floored atrium with a vast staircase leads to a
patio where another staircase leads to the galleries. A visitor has
to traverse three tiers of architecture before seeing a work of art.
Philbin and Elaine were taken aback by the building's austerity.
Standing in the glacial lobby, Philbin turned to Elaine and said,
"We've got to get some art in here."</TE>
<TE>   They began by commissioning artists to do murals on the soaring
interior walls, which can be seen through street-level windows that
face Wilshire Boulevard. For small solo shows, they added an
"entrance" gallery and converted an upstairs space into the so-called
vault gallery, named for its convex ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   Elaine's decisions are made with the input of Philbin, senior
curator Russell Ferguson and assistant curator Claudine Ise. "We are
a team," says Elaine, "representing different perspectives and
tastes. It's a good way to define and broaden ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   "We see ourselves as creating a model for a nimble, responsive
program that is the right scale for what we are trying to do,"
Philbin adds. Compared with a major exhibition, which can cost more
than $500,000, Hammer Projects shows are budgeted between $20,000 and
$35,000.</TE>
<TE>   It's a great value, Philbin says. "I've been told that some people
feel our museum does too many diverse things and doesn't have a clear
identity. But what we give up in the way of a marketable identity, we
gain back in excitement and unpredictability. Museums usually can't
behave this way, but we are going to try and do it anyway."</TE>
<TE>   As director of New York City's Drawing Center, Philbin worked with
Elaine from 1989 to 1999. When she came to the Hammer in 1999, she
asked Elaine to join her and to create a series for emerging artists.
"Unlike New York," she says, "there are not very many noncommercial
venues for exposure. I thought it was appropriate for the museum to
offer this, especially if you consider that we are attached to UCLA,
a research university. We extend that thinking into our realm by
giving artists a chance to do things in a laboratory kind of
environment."</TE>
<TE>   Rhode Island artist Kara Walker was the first artist to show in
the Hammer Projects series. Although she had received a MacArthur
grant and had numerous museum exhibitions to her credit, her
selection represented a certain symmetry for Elaine and Philbin. Ten
years earlier, when Walker was still unknown, they had been the first
to exhibit her cutout paper silhouettes of African American
characters at the Drawing Center.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Elaine was visiting artists' studios and galleries. In
June 2000 he showed L.A. artist James Gobel. Since then, the artist's
felt collages of homosexual domesticity have had critical praise and
commercial success at galleries in New York and L.A. The following
fall, Pentti Monkkonen exhibited a sculpture of cast stone in the
shape of a cathedral. It was spotted by Erik and Heide Murkoff, who
already collected the artist's work. They commissioned a similar
architectural sculpture for their Montecito garden.</TE>
<TE>   Although some 40% of the Projects artists have been local, Elaine
says, "It's myopic to only focus on L.A. We have a desire to help the
community by bringing in national and international art. A lot of
artists can't travel. They don't have the money. It's important to
bring the art here. It lifts up the whole stature of the Projects
Series."</TE>
<TE>   Arturo Herrera, who lives in New York, was commissioned to paint
the lobby with a giant mural combining abstract poured forms with
vernacular imagery in February 2001. "That for me was the largest
project I've done to date," he recalls. "Even though it was complex
and difficult to execute, it was successful for me because it allowed
me to push the work further. One direct result was that the Whitney
Museum had me do an installation last September. They had seen the
Hammer piece and were excited." Elaine was the Western states advisor
to last spring's Whitney Biennial; Herrera was included in the show.</TE>
<TE>   In May 2001, San Francisco artist Chris Johanson filled the
entrance gallery with an elaborate arrangement of buildings, cars and
people making philosophical observations in little bubble captions.
"It's cool, their attitude about how they really foster young art,"
Johanson says. "What is awesome is that they are really into giving
unknown artists exposure; they champion that." Since then, Johanson
was also included in last spring's Whitney Biennial. Roberts/Tilton
Gallery and Deitch Projects in New York began representing him.</TE>
<TE>   "It exposed me to that," he says. "I think that the mausoleum
quality of the art world can be so stale. The people at the Hammer
take chances. They are just into tripping out on the new stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Series adds flexibility</TE>
<TE>   Not all artists shown at the Hammer are untried. Ise organized
exhibitions of Frances Stark and Amy Adler, both of whom had already
received critical and commercial recognition. Now, the walls of the
museum lobby are covered in round-cornered rectangles and squares of
Popsicle bright colors. The vinyl decal geometry is courtesy of Jim
Isermann, a mid-career L.A. artist who shows nationally,
internationally and who has had a retrospective. In fact, he used
similar vinyl decals in a different configuration as an installation
at the contemporary art museum in Grenoble, France.</TE>
<TE>   Elaine says that as the series evolves it's getting more flexible.
"But even in the beginning, we thought the wall drawings would have
to involve more mature artists. It's a major undertaking for an
artist to work on that scale. Plus, Isermann's work is perfect for
those walls."</TE>
<TE>   The entrance gallery contains Modernist birdhouses inverted onto
tree branches by Scottish artist Simon Starling. The vault gallery
holds a lamppost bent into a triangular reference to modern sculpture
by Miami artist Mark Handforth. Like all of the Projects, each show
is accompanied by handsome brochures with commissioned essays so the
artist's work is presented with context, history and analysis.</TE>
<TE>   Many Projects shows have featured elements of installation
sculpture, which was Elaine's medium when he was an artist living in
a New York loft. Now a Venice resident, he has taken up Super 8 film
and video that he shows at festivals. He squeezes his art-making into
the time that he is not researching discoveries. "It takes a lot of
time," he says. "I came to a curatorial position through the back
door, but it's something I love. I love artists and I especially love
lesser-known artists. The program comes out of my passion for that."</TE>
<TE>   Seeing himself as something of a mentor to younger artists, he is
pleased to see them achieve recognition but says, "It is not a
foundational reason for Hammer Projects. It's not why the series
exists.</TE>
<TE>   "I have found people early on and encouraged them but I don't
think of myself as someone who discovers people," he says. "I think
discovery is actually within the artists themselves. I'm lucky to be
able to pick up on it."</TE>

<LD>There have been 28 exhibitions in the Hammer Projects series since
1999, taking up the wall space of the museum's staircase and lobby
and two smaller galleries near the lobby. Most of the artists are Los
Angeles-based; all of them are under 40.</LD>

<CP>PHOTO: James Gobel landed his Projects show a year after he
got his MFA at UC Santa Barbara. His subject matter was big-guy gay
domesticity; his materials, felt, yarn and paint. The Projects
brochure essay, by Nayland Blake, called these works "homey in their
conception, extravagant in their execution." "The felt seems to
absorb your vision, making you strain to see the picture clearly,"
wrote Times art critic Christopher Knight. "Therein lies their
singular resonance." Gobel, born in Portland, Ore., in 1972 will have
his third show at New York's Kravets/Wehby Gallery in the spring.</CP>

<CP>PHOTO: Arturo Herrera's "When Alone Again" (detail above)
filled the walls of the Hammer Museum staircase early in 2001, taking
over the heart of the space that inspired the Projects series. Now a
New Yorker, Herrera was born in Venezuela in 1959, and he fits into
curator James Elaine's mission to import artists as well as show
locals. Essayist Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev described these wall
paintings as "ambivalent zones where full-blown narrative seems ...
just a breath away." Herrera has a mural commission for an INS
building in Chicago and his work will be included in a show at
Castello di Rivoli in Turin, Italy, in the spring.</CP>

<CP>PHOTO: "Rural simplicity meets urban chaos," wrote
Christopher Knight in his review of the Projects exhibition devoted
to Chris Johanson's work. The work, Knight said, "proposes
generosity, willingness and humanity as a palliatives to the ...
brutalities of modern life." Born in 1968, the San Francisco artist
has a show at the Museum of Modern Art there in March.</CP>

<CP>PHOTO: Pentti Monkkonen, born in St. Paul, Minn., in 1975,
graduated from UCLA in 1997. One of his pieces for the Projects
series was a chair topped by a cantilevered replica of a Northrop
fighter aircraft. The chair "reads as a free association history of
designs born of aesthetics, function, power and ... faith, with
California as a crossroads," wrote Christopher Miles in the
exhibition essay. Monkkonen will be showing in the spring at a new
Manhattan gallery called Our House.</CP>

<LD>   "NE vs. NC: Nebraska vs.</LD>
<LD>   North Carolina" (Redemption)</LD>
<TE>   ** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   A RIVALRY is a dangerous thing to start, even for art's sake.
After all, what kind of beef could exist between the alternative rock
musics of Nebraska and North Carolina -- who can be the most emo?</TE>
<TE>   Well, it wasn't a question before, but now it is. The first in a
planned series of compilation albums from Beverly Hills' Redemption
Records pitting scene against scene, "NE vs. NC: Nebraska vs. North
Carolina" gathers a vast array of material into two discs, each
defining the self-flagellating "emotional" post-punk sound in these
two very intriguing indie-rock scenes.</TE>
<TE>   But from this flimsy premise emerges not a competition about which
sounds better, but a vital document of rock culture outside the
mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   For Redemption head Ryan Kuper, who also manages the musical
career of comedian Andy Dick, "NE vs. NC" was an excuse to document
two scenes he thought were doing indie rock the right way: nurturing
new sounds true to one locale.</TE>
<TE>   A testament to the quality of the project, the differences do
emerge. Though both discs contain a smattering of pop, Orange
County-style pop punk and garage, mostly this is the tale of two
emos: the Carolinian being more knowing and true to traditional rock
forms, and the Nebraskan more naive and fresh.</TE>
<TE>   From America's newest pain vortex, Omaha, come such fascinating
and highly listenable groups as Desaparecidos, a side project of
Bright Eyes' Conor Oberst. "What's New for Fall" is the best example
on this disc of what seem to be the area's trademarks, reflected in
Race for Titles, Neva Dinova, the Good Life, Cursive and other
standout bands -- a loose, free-flowing garage sensibility with a
deep affection for sensitive new wave melodies and vocal styles, put
through an indie rock mulcher.</TE>
<TE>   There must be something in the prairie soil of Nebraska that keeps
the Cure's Robert Smith sounding fresh, because there's a whole lot
of his inflection seeping out of these Midwestern post-punks. Omaha
is a lifestyle away from anywhere else that's ever had a music scene
in this country, and it sounds it.</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina, on the other hand, is more tied to the apron
strings of Eastern hard-core, with the Chapel Hill area having been
conspicuously hip since at least the '80s. Bands such as the Scaries,
Beloved, the Ladderback and One Six Conspiracy are more into a spiky,
technical, from-soft-to-a-roar punk sound that echoes the D.C. legacy
of Fugazi or, in the case of Kudzu Wish, more no-wave experimental
units such as Sonic Youth.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Nebraska might hold the key to a breakthrough, but
North Carolina has a more technically accomplished sound. But this
compilation's other lesson is that these are just dangerous
generalities. More important is the idea that emo might just produce
your next favorite band.</TE>

<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Don't look for cartoon music at the second UCLA All Tomorrow's
Parties music festival in June just because "The Simpsons" and
"Futurama" creator Matt Groening is serving as curator.</LD>
<LD>   The animation mogul was a rock critic (for the old Los Angeles
Reader) long before he sired his TV broods. His passion for music
outside the mainstream is clear with the booking of the keystone act
for the four-day event: a reunion of the Magic Band, which backed
outsider icon Captain Beefheart and helped realize his distinctive
vision.</LD>
<LD>   At Groening's urging, the group will reunite -- more than 20 years
after Beefheart, who won't be part of the reunion, retired from music
-- to play the June 19-22 fest. The band will make one other
appearance: the U.K. version of All Tomorrow's Parties in April,
which techno act Autechre is curating.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a great opportunity," Groening, 48, says. "I love that
music. I don't know how many times I saw that band perform, but it's
the most hair-raising rock music ever made."</TE>
<TE>   The Magic Band will be anchored by drummer John "Drumbo" French
and bassist Mark "Rockette Morton" Buston, both of whom were featured
on Beefheart's essential album, 1969's "Trout Mask Replica."
Guitarists Gary Lucas and Denny "Feelers Reebo" Walley, veterans of
later Magic Band editions, are also on board to perform the group's
complex music, with various guests to be announced.</TE>
<TE>   For Groening, it's the perfect tone-setter as he, festival creator
Barry Hogan and UCLA Live director of performing arts David Sefton
confirm the rest of the roster. "I'm fond of eccentric visions and
people who are pursuing careers not based on overwhelming sales,"
Groening says. "And I'm hoping none of the bands' music can be used
in car commercials."</TE>
<TE>   Some good bets to be featured are Japanese acts and artists
falling in the "outsider" realm.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm definitely a fan of Japanese rock, the wilder stuff like the
Boredoms and Cornelius," he says. "And to me, what people refer to as
outsider music is just great stuff, like Johnny Dowd or Unknown
Hinson."</TE>
<TE>   The only other act confirmed so far is alternative rock band the
Breeders.</TE>
<TE>   One big difference between the 2003 edition and the first version,
held last spring under the guidance of the band Sonic Youth, is the
physical setup. Last year's event was held on the UCLA campus, with
simultaneous shows at Royce Hall, Ackerman Ballroom and other
facilities. Next year, some shows will take place at Royce, others at
three classic movie theaters in downtown L.A.: the Orpheum, the
Palace and the Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In keeping with the ornate early 20th century decor of the
theaters, Groening plans to echo that earlier era in the shows
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to put in some vaudeville acts in between the music,"
he says. "It won't just be pouting, sullen rock 'n' rollers."</TE>
<TE>   Morissette's new broom</TE>
<TE>   Eight previously unreleased Alanis Morissette songs will be
featured on a CD to be packaged with a concert DVD due Dec. 10. The
"Feast on Scraps: Inside Under Rug Swept" DVD centers on a
performance in Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, earlier this year, and
includes other concert excerpts and home videos.</TE>
<TE>   The CD will include songs recorded during sessions for her "Under
Rug Swept" album: "Fear of Bliss," "Bent for You," "Sorry to Myself,"
"Sister Blister," "Offer," "Unprodigal Daughter," "Simple Together"
and "Purgatorying," plus an acoustic version of "Hands Clean."</TE>
<TE>   Patsy Cline's duds can be yours</TE>
<TE>   A lot of people have sung Patsy Cline hits since she died in a
1963 plane crash. But how many have done so while wearing her
clothes? Now 20 stage outfits worn by the country singer -- many made
by her mother, Hilda Hensley -- will be auctioned Dec. 19 through
Profiles in History in Beverly Hills, with live Internet bidding
taken through EBay.</TE>
<TE>   Among the outfits to be auctioned are a black sequined dress seen
on the cover of her album "In Care of the Blues," black capri pants
she wore on the cover of "The Sound of Patsy Cline" and the gold
dress with black lace she wore for a Carnegie Hall concert in 1961.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, 21 letters from Cline to a friend will be auctioned,
many revealing her thoughts and experiences as she rose to stardom.
Proceeds from the sales will benefit the estate of Hensley, who died
in 1998, and her son Sam Hensley, who intends to establish a Patsy
Cline museum. Auction organizers hope that some who purchase the
items will then loan or donate them back to the museum.</TE>
<TE>   Small faces</TE>
<TE>   Robi Rosa, the former Menudo member and co-writer of "Livin' La
Vida Loca," is working on his first English-language solo album, due
in March. His new music is being compared to Seal's for its mix of
soul and rock elements ....</TE>
<TE>   Kenna, an artist originally signed by Fred Durst to his Flawless
Records label, is now set to release his debut album on Columbia
Records at the end of January. The Neptunes' Chad Hugo, who also
co-wrote much of the material, produced the album, which evokes such
'80s influences as New Order ....</TE>
<TE>   An exhibit and sale of art by music marketing executive Macey
Lippman will in part benefit the recording academy's MusiCares
charity, which assists music professionals in financial and medical
need. Lippman is best known for overseeing marketing campaigns for
acts ranging from Cher to ZZ Top. He has long been active as a
painter and photographer, with Italian and California wine country
scenes a focus. His showing at the Hamilton-Selway Gallery in West
Hollywood runs Monday through Nov. 18.</TE>

<LD>Pearl Jam</LD>
<LD>   "Riot Act" (Epic)</LD>
<LD>   ****</LD>
<TE>   From "Alive" on, Pearl Jam has been as much about hope as
disaffection, even if some of the balance was lost in misdirected
emotions and unfocused musical explorations after that early-'90s
burst. The balance is back, as "Riot Act" (in stores Tuesday) builds
on the confidence and growth of 2000's "Binaural" for an often
stunning album that is PJ's strongest since 1994's "Vitalogy."</TE>
<TE>   "To the universe I don't mean a thing / And there's just one word
that I still believe and it's love," Eddie Vedder sings in "Love Boat
Captain," evoking John Lennon and delineating what he can and cannot
change. Yet while he covets stability and contentment, he's
constantly checking his emotional compass. Looking outside himself,
he turns Beat poet to address political change, tackling the
president on "Bushleaguer."</TE>
<TE>   All this is supported by the band's richest musical effort. On one
front, Pearl Jam has evolved into a world-class folk-rock band. When
it fires up the rock burners, it's powerful and exhilarating.</TE>
<TE>   "Riot Act" is a shining statement from a band unwilling to
compromise its integrity and identity or kowtow to conventions or
trends, and more alive and hopeful than ever.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Hochman</TE>
<TE>   Miss E.'s her own work in progress</TE>
<TE>   Missy Elliott</TE>
<TE>   "Under Construction" (Elektra)</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   Missy Elliott isn't saying her fourth album's not quite done. The
rapper-producer-songwriter is just noting that she's a work in
progress. Yet she has formidable building blocks at her command,
intricately weaving sexual braggadocio, social observations, feminist
ideals, pop-culture references and fashion commentaries with a
dizzying array of rap and R&amp;B-pop touchstones.</TE>
<TE>   Although not completely riveting, this alternately playful and
serious set (due in stores Tuesday) furthers the heavy tribal sound
of 2001's "Miss E ... So Addictive" by fusing deceptively minimal
throbbing percussion to skittering dance beats, dirty funk and
lilting soul. Abetted by longtime producing partner Timbaland,
Elliott even captures the neo-new-wave zeitgeist with "Work It,"
layering a "Heart of Glass"-like burble over techno and jangling
percussion. If "Can You Hear Me," her gospel-flavored tribute to such
departed stars as Aaliyah and TLC's Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes, is less
artful, the sentiment is still agonizingly understandable.</TE>
<TE>   Elliott is more entertaining (and educational) when wittily
flipping rap's masculine cliches on such tracks as "P***ycat" and
having her way with guests Method Man, Ludacris and Jay-Z. But she
also makes Beyonce Knowles the foil of "Nothing Out There for Me,"
which takes an obedient-to-her-man girlfriend to task. Elliott even
gets away with interrupting the flow with humorous monologues about
why her raps are so sexually explicit and how hip-hop has changed. If
this is Missy so far, can't wait to see what she comes up with next.</TE>
<TE>   -- Natalie Nichols</TE>
<TE>   Bridge over two generations</TE>
<TE>   Various artists</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing Left to Lose: A Tribute to Kris Kristofferson"</TE>
<TE>   (Incidental Music)</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   "Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose, and nothin'
ain't worth nothin', but it's free." That line from Kristofferson's
"Me and Bobby McGee" is worthy of Bob Dylan, and it was
Kristofferson's ability to mix Dylan's literary edge with the soulful
exposition of Hank Williams that made him one of the finest
songwriters to come out of Nashville in the early '70s.</TE>
<TE>   In such tunes as "Sunday Mornin', Comin' Down," "Help Me Make It
Through the Night" and "The Pilgrim (Chapter 33)," Kristofferson
expressed loneliness and alienation with an uncompromising richness
and detail. But the singer-songwriter soon left Nashville for
Hollywood, and his identity as an actor now overshadows his
songwriting accomplishments.</TE>
<TE>   In this imaginative compilation, alt-country and alt-rock outfits
including Grandaddy and the Handsome Family help interpret
Kristofferson for a new generation of listeners. The versions tend to
be stark and jarring, focusing on the desperate, uncertain
undercurrents of the music in ways that probably go beyond what
Kristofferson ever imagined. These are far from the definitive
versions of the songs, but they are interesting approaches that serve
as a bridge between young listeners who are looking for depth and
truth in music and an artist who once supplied both with a rebel's
soul and a craftsman's touch.</TE>
<TE>   -- Robert Hilburn</TE>
<TE>   In brief</TE>
<TE>   The Pretenders</TE>
<TE>   "Loose Screw" (Artemis)</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   Having exited major-label land to slug it out with the other indie
bands, Chrissie Hynde and her cohorts sound every bit up to the
challenge. Hynde's songs respond to the complexities of adult life
with the never-say-die spirit that is rock 'n' roll. She may be 51,
but there's still nobody who purrs, yowls or beckons the way she
does.</TE>
<TE>   -- Randy Lewis</TE>
<TE>   WC</TE>
<TE>   "Ghetto Heisman" (Def Jam)</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   Best known as one-third of the Ice Cube-fronted Westside
Connection, this veteran rapper is one of L.A.'s most respected
hip-hop figures. On his second solo album, WC tones down the
political commentary and delivers a strong batch of funk-heavy
gangster cuts that showcase his trademark exaggerated delivery
patterns and clever wordplay. The moving "Something 2 Live 4" and
"Tears of a Killa" add balance to this hard-core affair.</TE>
<TE>   -- Soren Baker</TE>
<TE>   Phil Collins</TE>
<TE>   "Testify" (Atlantic)</TE>
<TE>   **</TE>
<TE>   Collins is a moody, muted romantic, dependably slick and vaguely
soulful, and just as dependably bland. His first solo album in six
years (in stores Tuesday) offers no new twists on the '80s hit-making
schematic. He can still create a quietly tortured ballad that feels
somehow genuine, but the hooks are so soft and anonymous that songs
evaporate into a shapeless pop mist.</TE>
<TE>   -- Steve Appleford</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Cox</TE>
<TE>   "The Morning After" (J)</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   The R&amp;B-pop diva drew from experience for her third album, a
tough-tender treatise on modern romance. Standouts such as the
hopeful-yet-wary "2 Good 2 Be True" and the self-respect ballad
"Starting With You" define the real rules for cultivating practical
relationships along with true love. But it's Cox's caramel-smooth,
un-retouched voice that keeps every note human, even on two tingly
house remixes of earlier tunes.</TE>
<TE>   -- N.N.</TE>
<TE>   Crazy Town</TE>
<TE>   "Darkhorse" (Columbia)</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   The L.A. band isn't fading into one-hit wonderland without a
fight. "Darkhorse" (due Tuesday) has no fluffy, "Butterfly"-like
ditties, and the best tunes are steered more by pop and prog-rock
harmonies and crushing guitars than raps. It feels fresher and
meatier than its debut, "The Gift of Game," but until its brash,
boastful lyrics evolve as well, Crazy Town may never get the respect
it craves.</TE>

<LD>   "Charlie Christian: The Genius of the Electric Guitar"</LD>
<LD>   Columbia Legacy</LD>
<TE>   ****</TE>
<TE>   Charlie Christian's name is not likely to cause much of a stir
among young rock guitarists. But it should, since the pioneering,
Texas-born artist produced a body of work -- amazingly, in just two
years -- that is the foundation for the entire history of the
electric guitar, in jazz and beyond. The succeeding stages in the
instrument's development -- from Les Paul and Chuck Berry to Jimi
Hendrix, Eric Clapton, John McLaughlin, Joe Pass, etc. -- seem almost
inconceivable without Christian's establishment of the guitar's
enormous sonic potential beyond its qualities as an acoustic
instrument.</TE>
<TE>   A great deal -- but by no means all -- of Christian's most
impressive performances took place during his association with Benny
Goodman's big bands and small groups, from 1939 to 1941. The first
comprehensive collection of his Columbia recordings from that period
with the Goodman sextet and orchestra (with the addition of a
Metronome All-Star effort) has been gathered into a four-CD boxed
set.</TE>
<TE>   The first date included is a New York City studio session from
Oct. 2, 1939. The interest in Christian was high in the jazz world
from the very moment he joined Goodman. And, within a few short
months after his first official recording was issued, he won the Down
Beat magazine poll as best guitarist.</TE>
<TE>   What seems most astonishing about these early recordings is the
fully formed character of Christian's playing. The electric guitar
had surfaced in jazz shortly before his arrival via Eddie Durham and
George Barnes. And steel guitar was present in country music through
players such as Floyd Smith and the crossover efforts of Leon
McAuliffe with the swing-styled Bob Wills &amp; His Texas Playboys.</TE>
<TE>   But Christian seems to have been the first to recognize the real
potential of what could be done with sustained string notes. Taking
his cue from jazz horn players -- in particular, tenor saxophonist
Lester Young -- he developed a free-flowing, briskly swinging style
that, with amplification, allowed his long, lean melody lines to
integrate freely into the horn-dominated jazz of the Swing Era.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the tracks are dedicated to the familiar repertoire of the
sextets, first with vibist Lionel Hampton and Christian alongside
Goodman in the front line, later with Hampton replaced by tenor
saxophonist Georgie Auld. And, in one especially fascinating group of
tunes from 1940, the sextet is expanded and consists of Goodman,
Christian, Young, trumpeter Buck Clayton, pianist Count Basie, rhythm
guitarist Freddie Green, bassist Walter Page and drummer Jo Jones.
The few brief moments in which exchanges take place between Young and
Christian have a time-warp quality -- a momentary forecast of the
sounds and styles that would flow over the next decades from these
two seminal figures.</TE>
<TE>   Equally compelling are the two versions of Christian's "hit" (it
reached the pop charts), "Solo Flight," an envelope-stretching
original featuring his soaring guitar lines as the solo voice with
the full Goodman orchestra. And, finally, there is a loosely
structured jam session from a studio date in 1941. Here, in a freely
spontaneous setting, Christian's many innovative qualities are on
full display: his long, loping lines; his crisp accompaniment
chording, delivered on the offbeat in strikingly contemporary
fashion; his repetition of the same note on different strings; his
dramatic, often dissonant strumming. In effect, a virtual catalog of
guitar techniques that would be absorbed by many others.</TE>
<TE>   In early 1941 Christian became one of the regulars who attended
the jam sessions at Minton's in Harlem. Among the other participants
in what essentially served as the incubator for the birth of bebop
were Thelonious Monk, Kenny Clarke, Don Byas, Joe Guy, etc.
Recordings made by engineer Jerry Newman (not included in the
Columbia Legacy box) suggest that Christian was moving into a further
stage of development -- one that surely would have placed him
alongside Dizzy Gillespie, Bud Powell and Charlie Parker as icons of
the new jazz. But it wasn't to be.</TE>
<TE>   In July 1941, stricken with tuberculosis, he was placed in a
Staten Island hospital. The following January, while still
hospitalized, he was named best guitarist in the Down Beat poll for
the third consecutive year. Christian died on March 3, 1942. He was
25 years old.</TE>

<LD>"Sun Rings" collaborators Terry Riley, David Harrington and Willie
Williams all describe Donald Gurnett as an amiable tour guide to the
solar system. In fact, a visit to Gurnett's office can be
exhilarating and start your head spinning from the implications that
plasma physics and space sounds can have on life on Earth. Here are a
few typical Gurnett observations:</LD>
<LD>   "Worldwide, there are several hundred lightning flashes a second
producing whistlers, and lucky for us these sound waves aren't in our
atmosphere, or it would be really complicated to hear anybody talk."</LD>
<LD>   "I call some space sounds musical, but that raises an interesting
philosophical question: Does music have to be made by humans?"</LD>
<TE>   "Think about how few natural sounds there are here on Earth. If
you rule out animate objects, like birds and whales, what is left?
Thunder, wind blowing through trees, the tones you can get from the
tension on a wire or a telephone line, crashing ocean waves. That's
about it. But space is just full of weird tones that come and go."</TE>

<HD>New bond gives housing a boost</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Wedner</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dara Kovel awoke Wednesday morning to the news she had hoped for: At
last, her company's affordable, 72-unit multifamily housing project
in Oxnard might get off the ground, thanks to Tuesday's passage of
Proposition 46, the $2.1-billion housing bond issue.</LD>
<LD>   Mercy Housing California, the nonprofit company headed regionally
by Kovel that helps get affordable-housing projects built, is one of
dozens of nonprofit organizations that stand to benefit from the
$1.11 billion that Proposition 46 will funnel specifically into
programs that support the construction of multifamily housing for
low-income renters statewide.</LD>
<LD>   "There are many stalled developments out there, due to lack of
funds," Kovel said. "Now this beautiful development of affordable
townhomes in Oxnard just might get built."</LD>
<TE>   The proposition, which passed decisively, will create or preserve
131,000 to 134,000 units of housing statewide, according to the
California Department of Housing and Community Development. The bond
money will be spread among 21 housing programs, including $117.5
million for deferred low-interest loans and $75 million in
down-payment assistance, primarily for first-time low-income buyers.</TE>
<TE>   Builders such as KB Home that specialize in moderately priced
single-family homes will not directly benefit from the proposition's
passage, but they supported the measure anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Karatz, KB Home's chief executive and chairman, said that,
while he enthusiastically supported the measure, he would have
preferred that the programs covered under the proposition included
houses priced in the moderate range, where the need also is great.</TE>
<TE>   Karatz added that any infusion of funding that will address
California's affordable-housing crisis is welcome. Most builders
agree.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope this measure will make an important statement about the
need for the state to appropriate funds to help low-income people,
especially those with shelter needs," said Tim Coyle, a vice
president of the California Building Industry Assn., a trade group
based in Sacramento. "We hope the measure will establish a steady
flow of affordable-housing programs."</TE>

<HD>Re/Max sues CBS over TV realty sign</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Inman News Features and other wire reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" may be one of the most popular shows
on television, but not with the corporate types at Re/Max
International in Colorado.</LD>
<LD>   Re/Max has filed a civil lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Denver
against the CBS television network and its owner, Viacom. The suit
alleges trademark infringement in the Oct. 10 episode in which a real
estate agent used a yard sign similar in design to the Re/Max sign.
The sign is visible when an investigator says, "These slimes will do
anything to sell a home," according to the complaint.</LD>
<LD>   The suit also said the portrayal of an unethical real estate agent
-- suspected of robbery, pornography and homicide -- damaged the
company's reputation.</LD>
<TE>   CBS says it believes the allegations are without value. "We're
very confident that the lawsuit does not have any merit," said Nancy
Carr, a spokeswoman for the network.</TE>
<TE>   Re/Max co-founder Dave Liniger said the company has protected its
trademark rights for 30 years. "We are not a litigious organization,"
he said. "But, we have an obligation to more than 76,000 Re/Max
agents worldwide to prevent others from using any of our trademarks."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Greenwood Village, Colo., company reached an
agreement with EBay to remove a similar red, white and blue sign from
TV commercials. Earlier this year, the real estate franchise company
raised the trademark infringement question against a
for-sale-by-owner services company, which changed its Web site and
yard signs.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the similar sign, the suit against CBS and Viacom
alleges that the trademark term "Realtor" was misused on the yard
sign and in the script. Liniger said that the Re/Max legal team has
sent a copy of the lawsuit to the lawyers at the National Assn. of
Realtors, which owns the trademark.</TE>

<HD>Redondo Beach draws surfers and families</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Garrett</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Home to L.A. County's first port, Redondo Beach is better known today
as an affordable beach community than for commercial seafaring.
Entrenched in California surf culture since the early 1900s, the city
immortalized in the Beach Boys' "Surfing U.S.A." still draws surfers
to its shores. Incorporated in 1892, it's now home to 63,261
residents.</LD>
<LD>   Dividing lines</LD>
<LD>   The city's zigzag border breaks the community into two sections:
coastline-hugging South Redondo with a remarkably chain-free shopping
district and a hilly northern stretch that snakes east of Hermosa
Beach and Manhattan Beach to Hawthorne and Lawndale.</LD>
<TE>   Drawing card</TE>
<TE>   Family-friendly Redondo is the least expensive beach city within
easy commuting distance to Hollywood and the Westside.</TE>
<TE>   Wow factor</TE>
<TE>   Homes on South Redondo's alphabet avenues -- a diverse mix of
older cottages, condos and million-dollar-plus homes -- have
breathtaking views of the Pacific without the crime found in Venice
and Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Insider's view</TE>
<TE>   Parents in Redondo's Golden Hills section between Hermosa and
Manhattan beaches have been sending their children to highly regarded
Mira Costa High School in Manhattan Beach for years, although the
school district could curb the practice if attendance grows too high.
This would mean a longer trip to Redondo Union High School, which
tests well above average but not at the same level as Mira Costa.</TE>
<TE>   Good news, bad news</TE>
<TE>   Redondo's relatively affordable prices have kept home sales brisk,
according to Lorie O'Connor of South Bay Brokers. As demand rises,
however, older homes are being torn down and one or two bigger homes
are being built in their place, adding density sometimes at the
expense of charm.</TE>
<TE>   The city recently gave the pier a face lift but couldn't remove
all the tackiness, making for a strange mix of upscale eateries and
souvenir stands.</TE>
<TE>   Report card</TE>
<TE>   Jefferson Elementary School ranked 10 out of 10 on the state's
2001 Academic Performance Index and 7 out of 10 compared with similar
schools. It's such a draw that parents will consider moving into a
less desirable portion of North Redondo. Adams Middle School rated 8
out of 10 on both API indexes last year.</TE>
<TE>   Hot spots</TE>
<TE>   Realtors report high demand in the Golden Hills section and North
Redondo for their affordability and access to freeways. Tall skinny
houses on 25-by-100-square-foot lots in the Golden Hills area are
selling in the $400,000s with larger homes commanding up to $750,000.
In desirable South Redondo, "you don't really get anything below
$500,000, and that's a tear down," said Mary Stansbury of Re/Max
Beach Cities.</TE>
<TE>   On the market</TE>
<TE>   The first week of November there were 62 homes on the market, the
bulk in North Redondo, according to Realtor Don Karasevicz of Re/Max
Beach Cities.</TE>
<TE>   Stock report</TE>
<TE>   Redondo has 8,747 single-family residences and nearly as many
condos. There are 12,674 apartment units.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>This Echo Park home was built in 1905-06 as a Craftsman-style duplex
by A.J. Crawford, a contractor and builder, for his family.</LD>
<LD>   The sellers, Bruce Richards and his wife, Kim Kanatani, have used
it as a single-family home since they bought the property 16 years
ago. The house still could be used as a duplex with some minor
alterations, according to Ron Emler, who has the listing.</LD>
<LD>   Richards, an art professor at Cal Arts in Valencia, and Kanatani,
with the Museum of Contemporary Art in L.A., spent their years in the
house working on it and improving it for themselves, but they are
relocating to New York City, where she has accepted a position at the
Guggenheim Museum. Richards used the second floor of the home as an
art studio.</LD>
<TE>   About this house: The two-story house, on a hilltop overlooking
the city and Echo Park Lake, has a private drive adjacent to a public
stairway leading down to the lake and a park. There is a detached
carriage house with a hayloft and a full basement with wine storage.</TE>
<TE>   The main house, which has a new roof, is a showcase of period
workmanship. The house also has generously proportioned rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Asking price: $669,000</TE>
<TE>   Size: 3,810 square feet</TE>
<TE>   Features: The home has six bedrooms, 3.5 bathrooms, a music room
with pocket doors and a beveled-glass window. The living room has a
fireplace, and the dining room has French doors that open onto a
redwood deck and an updated kitchen. There is parking for three cars.</TE>

<HD>Actor finds a 'Majestic' spot on Malibu beach</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Jim Carrey, who stars in the upcoming movie "Bruce Almighty," has
purchased a Malibu home on the beach for about $9.5 million.</LD>
<LD>   Carrey had been renting in Venice and has had a Pacific Palisades
home, which he bought in 1994 for $4 million.</LD>
<LD>   The Malibu home was a mid-century modern that had been refurbished
and expanded. It has three bedrooms, including a master suite on the
water, and a maid's quarters in 4,000 to 4,500 square feet.</LD>
<TE>   Described as "very high-tech and beautiful with lots of glass,"
the two-level house also has a rooftop deck, limestone flooring and
30 feet of beach frontage. The property was not on the market.</TE>
<TE>   Carrey, 40, starred in the romantic comedy "The Majestic" last
year and had the title role in the live-action movie "How the Grinch
Stole Christmas" in 2000, the same year he teamed with the Farrelly
brothers to co-star with Renee Zellweger in the comedy "Me, Myself &amp;
Irene."</TE>
<TE>   In "Bruce Almighty," Carrey plays an unhappy TV reporter who is
given heavenly powers after complaining about how bad a job God is
doing running the universe. Morgan Freeman plays God in the film,
which is due out in May.</TE>
<TE>   Teen vocalist is in tune with the Hollywood Hills</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Branch, the hot, young singer-songwriter who recently
played '60s singer Lesley Gore on the NBC series "American Dreams,"
has purchased a Hollywood Hills home for $820,000.</TE>
<TE>   Branch, 19, bought a three-bedroom, 2,800-square foot house that
was built in the 1930s but was completely remodeled. The
Mediterranean-style house has three bathrooms, stainless steel
kitchen appliances, a media/family room and a master suite with large
decks.</TE>
<TE>   The chart-topping singer moved last spring to an L.A. apartment
from her family's home in Sedona, Ariz., where her album, "The Spirit
Room," debuted in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The MTV favorite subsequently recorded the hits "Everywhere, All
You Wanted" and "Goodbye to You." She made the single "Game of Love"
with guitarist Carlos Santana for his album "Shaman," released last
month.</TE>
<TE>   Tracey Hannum at Hilton &amp; Hyland had the listing on the house
Branch bought, and Brad Wiseman of Platinum Realty represented
Branch, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Giving up her walk in the park</TE>
<TE>   Rachel Hunter, the New Zealand-born model-actress, has listed her
Beverly Hills-area home, on slightly more than 1.2 acres of park-like
grounds, at just under $3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter, 32, separated from rock star Rod Stewart in 1999 after
eight years of marriage. The same year, she purchased the Country
English-style home, up a long driveway behind gates. The home was
formerly owned by actor Shadoe Stevens.</TE>
<TE>   The house has a large master suite with vaulted ceilings,
skylights, a fireplace and a loft/office. There are three other
bedroom suites plus a maid's quarters in the 4,500-square-foot house.</TE>
<TE>   The house, built in the 1950s and later renovated, opens onto a
pool and a tennis court.</TE>
<TE>   Asher Dann at Coldwell Banker, Beverly Hills North, has the
listing.</TE>
<TE>   Cybill downsizes as kids leave home</TE>
<TE>   Cybill Shepherd, who listed her San Fernando Valley home in
September at just under $3.5 million, has sold the property for just
over $3 million, and she has purchased a smaller house nearby for
about $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   The actress, who is single, said in September that she wanted to
scale down now that two of her three children are away at school. She
also has a riverfront home in Memphis, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   The San Fernando Valley home she sold is on about an acre, is
behind gates and has five bedrooms plus maid's quarters in slightly
under 7,000 square feet. The grounds have a guest house, tennis
court, pool, spa and valley views.</TE>
<TE>   The home she bought has valley views as well as three bedrooms in
about 3,000 square feet, behind gates. The Cape Cod-style home was
designed by Gerald Colcord and built in the early '60s.</TE>
<TE>   Shepherd appeared earlier this year in the Showtime movie "Due
East." She performed on the London stage in March, starred in her own
sitcom, "Cybill," during the '90s, and co-starred earlier with Bruce
Willis in the TV series "Moonlighting." The actress, 52, is
developing a musical based on her life.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Manning of Prudential California, Sherman Oaks, represented
the buyers of Shepherd's former home, which Lou Woolf at Coldwell
Banker, Sherman Oaks, had listed. Woolf represented Shepherd in
buying the listing of Lisa and Scott Sorentino of Prudential
California, Studio City, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Restaurateurs will lease their hamlet</TE>
<TE>   Marilyn and Harry Lewis, owners of the Beverly Hills restaurant
Kate Mantilini and founders of the Hamburger Hamlet chain, have
renovated their former Beverly Hills home of 30 years and put it up
for lease at $25,000 a month. The Lewises live in a Wilshire
penthouse.</TE>
<TE>   The home they have for lease has six bedrooms and a guest house in
7,300 square feet. "We had four rooms where the new kitchen is,"
Harry Lewis said.</TE>
<TE>   His wife says she learned to cook in the old kitchen. The
landscaping and pool of the 60-year-old house also were refurbished.</TE>
<TE>   Howard Schreiber of Schreiber Realty, Beverly Hills, has the
listing.</TE>
<TE>   Route 66 town is up for sale</TE>
<TE>   The town of Amboy on historic Route 66 in California has been
listed at $1.9 million. It was unofficially on the market in 2001 at
$5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The owners are Timothy White, a New York-based celebrity
photographer whose coffee table book "Portraits" was recently
published, and his business partner, Walt Wilson. They bought Amboy a
few years ago when they drifted into town on Harleys looking for gas.
White is the mayor of Amboy; Wilson is justice of the peace.</TE>
<TE>   Amboy, in the Mojave Desert near Twentynine Palms, was founded in
1858 by miners. It was booming when Route 66 was paved in the 1920s.
When Interstate 40 was built in 1972, Amboy took a backseat as a
thoroughfare and became a tourist attraction for the curious and a
location for movie and photo shoots.</TE>
<TE>   The 690-acre property includes Roy's Cafe, a relic from the '40s
that is in working condition; a four-pump gas station with new gas
tanks; an operational post office; eight motel cottages and 20 motel
rooms in various states of repair; a town office and gift shop; a
church without pews; and a garage with a working repair shop.</TE>
<TE>   There are also four houses, some occupied, and an apartment
building, which is in need of complete renovation.</TE>
<TE>   The town, 211 miles from L.A. and 154 miles from Las Vegas, is
listed with Rob McManus of Dilbeck Realtors, San Marino.</TE>

<HD>Fed's rate cut affecting mortgage rates differently</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From staff and wire reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While pundits debate the economic jolt from the Federal Reserve's
interest rate cut last week, the unexpectedly generous
half-percentage-point reduction is rippling across parts of the
mortgage scene.</LD>
<LD>   For borrowers with home equity lines of credit, rates began
falling on the variable-rate loans tied directly to the prime rate,
which has been on the decline with the Fed's new 1.25% federal funds
rate. Rates on adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs, could fall too.</LD>
<LD>   But borrowers in search of lower fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages are
not likely to see much change in these rates, which are linked to
10-year Treasury notes, not short-term rates. The Fed's cut was the
first this year -- after 11 reductions in 2001.</LD>

<DH>Low-income units in pricey developments help builders win
approval for their projects, and qualifying tenants find homes they
could never afford.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Wedner</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jesus Chavez stood on the second-floor balcony of his Montecito
townhouse, reveling in the million-dollar view before him.</LD>
<LD>   Facing west, as far as the eye could see, tall trees and exquisite
landscaping surrounded mansions and haciendas on properties the size
of parks. A few feet below him stretched quaint Isabella Lane, a
narrow street lined with seven large Spanish Colonial homes and eight
townhomes that make up the complex where the nursing student lives.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel like we won the lottery!'' said Chavez, 33, as he pointed
out the development's private leafy park anchoring the
multimillion-dollar homes.</LD>
<TE>   Actually, he and his wife, Estela Chavez, 35, did win a lottery.
The couple, along with seven other low- to moderate-income families,
were among a pool of about 90 qualified applicants selected by
lottery to live affordably among the ultra-rich in the sumptuous
seaside community.</TE>
<TE>   The Chavezes are not alone. From San Diego to Santa Barbara, a
growing number of builders, large and small, are setting aside
affordable units, or even whole buildings, for lower-income residents
in high-rent districts.</TE>
<TE>   Figures are not available on the exact number of these complexes
in upscale Southern California neighborhoods, but housing experts say
their numbers are rising as builders have come to realize that
including affordable units in new developments often is the only way
a project can win city approval.</TE>
<TE>   The low-income renters who benefit from the arrangement aren't
complaining.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a palace!" said Brian Walsh, a high-energy, tattooed
decorative artist who resides with his cat, Babu, in an airy
one-bedroom unit filled with art at the Los Altos Apartments.</TE>
<TE>   The upscale, historic building was constructed in 1925 near the
old-money Windsor Square neighborhood of Los Angeles. Rents at the
complex run from $570 a month for lower-income residents like Walsh,
to $5,000 for the "Hearst" apartment, a huge, wood-paneled unit with
high ceilings, which William Randolph Hearst had built for his
mistress, actress Marion Davies.</TE>
<TE>   Walsh, 43, passed by the construction site for weeks while the
historic building was under renovation. Then he tracked down the
owners to see how he could qualify for one of the individually
designed, affordable units. He applied through the city's housing
department and, in 1999, was among the first to move in.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind that this stretch of Wilshire Boulevard lacks basic
amenities for a single guy, such as restaurants or nightlife, or that
when he first moved in he got the cold shoulder from some renters
paying full freight. Those tenants are gone now, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Today, when he steps into the meticulously refurbished building,
the artist soaks up the aesthetics of the lobby's original tile
floors, antique light fixtures and mahogany doors with brass and
nickel trim, and he counts his blessings.</TE>
<TE>   "The owners gave people like me, who couldn't normally live in a
place like this, the opportunity to do it," Walsh said.</TE>
<TE>   That's exactly what developers Allen Gross, 32, and his wife, Arax
Harutunian, 32, hoped for when they took on the Los Altos project in
1995. The abandoned building, home to Betty Davis, Douglas Fairbanks
Jr. and Ava Gardner during Hollywood's heyday, was slated for
demolition.</TE>
<TE>   This was an unthinkable prospect to Gross, who is in the business
of refurbishing historic buildings. Seeing the potential of the
structure, and in favor of including lower-income units, the couple
plunged into the arduous process of lining up financing for the
project.</TE>
<TE>   They received some funding assistance from the city's housing
department after guaranteeing that about 20% of the building's 67
units would be set aside for low- to moderate-income renters.
Financing in place, they went to work re-creating the grandeur of the
building, down to the doorknobs.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a labor of love," Gross said. "We needed $1,000 or more [a
month] per unit for the rehab, but we charge only $500 for many of
the units, so we did a lot of begging" for tax-exempt bonds to get
the project done. It was completed in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Shopping out of the area</TE>
<TE>   Anna and Charles Brown, both 79, enjoy the occasional chamber
concerts and fashion shows that take place in the lobby. Nonetheless,
the couple, who spent the previous 35 years in a West Adams district
apartment, have not found convenient shopping nearby, so they drive
to Baldwin Hills for clothes, haircuts and line dancing, Anna's
hobby.</TE>
<TE>   "At first we didn't want to live here, because there isn't easy
access to my friends and activities," said Anna Brown, a tall,
impeccably dressed community volunteer, seated comfortably in her
decorated two-bedroom, two-bath apartment. "But I take the bus and
walk everywhere now, and like living here."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica, Pacific Palisades and Irvine are among the Southern
California cities where housing department officials, desperate for
lower-income housing units, are pressing developers to include
affordable units in their apartment buildings. Los Angeles County has
gained 306,000 people since the 2000 census but has added only 35,300
housing units in that time.</TE>
<TE>   Among the incentives cities, counties and the federal government
offer are bond financing, Housing and Urban Development funds for
very low-income units and "density bonuses," city funds awarded to
developers who set aside a percentage of units for low- to
moderate-income renters, said Ralph Esparza, assistant general
manager of the Los Angeles Housing Department.</TE>
<TE>   "These projects generally are built in areas that can generate
higher rents," said Peter Mezza, housing authority administrator of
Santa Monica. This offsets the losses owners incur from collecting
rents well below market value on the 20% to 50% of lower-income
units.</TE>
<TE>   That is the outcome the Quinta Isabella developers are counting on
in Montecito, where available land is at a premium and affordable,
multifamily housing barely exists.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, Jim Daub, 55, and Wright Watling, 52, began the
application process for a small parcel of land where their 15-home
project now sits. The property, in the heart of Montecito, was
originally three acres and zoned for one residence.</TE>
<TE>   The pair were told by the county that they could develop
high-density housing on 1 1/2 acres of the land and get financial
assistance for it if they agreed to set aside 50% of the residences
as "affordable," an unusually large concession.</TE>
<TE>   Daub and Watling agreed to the provision, knowing they could sell
the market-rate homes for a high enough price to offset the losses on
the affordable units. After four years of financing and city-planning
roadblocks, they began construction on the seven two- and
three-bedroom homes. The houses are 2,500 to 3,100 square feet, with
private patios, custom steel French doors and tumbled-marble tiles.
They cost $1.5 million to $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   The development's eight affordable rental units, whose exteriors
resemble their luxurious counterparts, go for $800 to $1,500 a month
and are 1,050 square feet. They are attached, have three small
bedrooms and come with standard apartment-style interiors, such as

<TE>   Winning the 'lottery'</TE>
<TE>   The Chavezes, who moved there in June when the development opened,
are paying about $1,500 a month for their unit, which is considered
moderate by Montecito standards. They had lived in a $900-a-month
one-bedroom condo in Santa Barbara for nine years before hearing
about the Quinta Isabella lottery.</TE>
<TE>   As much as they love the extra bedrooms, built-in appliances and
safe neighborhood, there are some drawbacks to living in such a ritzy
area.</TE>
<TE>   "Who can afford to buy a loaf of bread here?" Jesus Chavez said,
chuckling at the prospect of shopping at the pricey Village Grocery
or The Village Cheese and Wine Store nearby. "We shop at Costco in
Goleta and buy our clothes in Santa Barbara."</TE>
<TE>   The family of four accepts the rule about no noise after 8 p.m.
but bristles a little at the restriction against barbecuing on the
premises. "We grill at the park," Chavez said.</TE>
<TE>   The two children, Eric, 9, and Hugo, 5, are enrolled at Montecito
Union Elementary School around the corner and are among the few
Latinos attending the highly rated school, said Dick Douglas,
superintendent of the Montecito Union School District.</TE>
<TE>   They have begun making friends there but still feel a little out
of place, their parents said. Nonetheless, the family wouldn't trade
their situation for anything, Chavez said.</TE>
<TE>   'Affordable' stigma</TE>
<TE>   While seven of the eight condos have been rented so far, only four
of the seven homes have been sold at the high-end development, said
Daub's wife, Alison, 38. Some potential buyers attach a stigma to
living near the affordable units, she said, despite the fact that the
residents occupying the "affordables" earn between $40,000 and
$70,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   "The word 'affordable' has a connotation in this community,"
Alison Daub said. "It's a barrier that has to be crossed."</TE>
<TE>   That barrier may be present in other communities too, but for the
residents at Casa Gateway in Pacific Palisades, it is less apparent.</TE>
<TE>   Their complex of 100 affordable condominiums and townhomes, 68 of
which are set aside for lower-income seniors, faces the
Self-Realization Fellowship Temple and Lake Shrine on Sunset
Boulevard, a sylvan spiritual sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   The housing development is surrounded by multimillion-dollar homes
and is about a quarter of a mile from the beach.</TE>
<TE>   Driving by the lushly landscaped, Mediterranean-style three-story
complex, no one would guess that the annual incomes of the residents
living there range from about $33,000 to $37,000.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-two of the units are for low-income families.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Breidenbach, 82, bought her condo in 1989 for $82,000 and
pays about $500 a month for her combined mortgage and association
fees. Today the affordable condo would sell for about $127,000, in a
neighborhood where comparable condos fetch $400,000, said Casa
Gateway manager Steve Barnard.</TE>
<TE>   The retired secretary, a longtime Westchester apartment renter,
had to be talked into the Palisades purchase by her son, who saw the
one-bedroom affordable unit as a way to build equity and enjoy a more
upscale neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Breidenbach is grateful to live in such a plush setting, but she
initially suffered some sticker shock. Pulling into the village gas
station for the first time, ready to pump her own gas, she realized
that all the islands were full-serve (and top dollar). And there was
the trip to the local hair salon, where perms cost $100, just a tad
high for her fixed income.</TE>
<TE>   "Where I live, there are people struggling for their groceries and
others rolling in money," Breidenbach said. "There's a little
friendly kidding about which income group lives on which floor."</TE>
<TE>   Grand Tower in downtown Los Angeles is one of two Goldrich &amp; Kest
Civic Center developments where low- and moderate-income renters
share floors with market-value renters. No one knows who pays $625
for a low-income studio or who pays $2,800 for a market-rate
two-bedroom unit.</TE>
<TE>   Regina Kirschenbaum, 35, a longtime Grand Tower resident who works
downtown, saw an ad for the residence eight years ago, touting the
building's sauna, gym and swimming pool, and its location across the
street from the Museum of Contemporary Art. A struggling student at
the time, she called about a rental on a dare from a friend.</TE>
<TE>   "I was told what the rents go for there and nearly fainted,"
Kirschenbaum said. "After I regained consciousness, the leasing agent
mentioned that they had some affordable units too, and I ran down
there and signed a lease that day."</TE>
<TE>   She bemoans downtown's lack of excitement -- it's no Greenwich
Village -- but feels lucky to pay only $700 for her one-bedroom
apartment, which would cost $1,200 were she not eligible for the
set-aside program.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not a lot of stuff going on here yet; they need a lot
more housing and shopping downtown to make it a good neighborhood,"
Kirschenbaum said. "But it's unique to live in such a nice building
and pay so little."</TE>
<TE>   As cities continue to push for lower-income housing in upscale
neighborhoods, those who already benefit from such programs
appreciate even the unexpected perks.</TE>
<TE>   "After I moved into my condo, I went to an anniversary party in
Santa Barbara," Breidenbach said. "I was introduced by the [disc
jockey] as 'Mary Breidenbach from Pacific Palisades.' Believe me,
that wouldn't have happened before."</TE>

<HD>How to make the best with a little less</HD>
<DH>Not So Big Solutions for Your Home, Sarah Susanka , Taunton
Press: 155 pages, $22.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert J. Bruss</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you plan to build a new home or remodel your existing residence,
first spend time studying author Sarah Susanka's "Not So Big
Solutions for Your Home." In her latest book, Susanka emphasizes
modest home component features rather than the big, lavish designs
that many other architects seem to favor.</LD>
<LD>   "This book is a training manual for those who want to learn how to
tailor their homes to fit their lifestyles," the author begins. "The
insights and explanations come from many years of experience as a
residential architect, working with normal everyday folks, with
normal everyday problems," she continues.</LD>
<LD>   The book is based on Susanka's "Drawing Board" column in Fine
Homebuilding magazine. Her theme is comfortable size rather than big,
lavish and showy. As explained in her best-selling books, "The Not So
Big House" and "Creating the Not So Big House," which sold more than
500,000 total copies, her simple messages are do more with less space
and make homes work better in the process.</LD>
<TE>   Simple ideas, illustrated with numerous drawings, show how modest
changes in a home can make big differences. For example, Susanka
shows how a sloping lot can be a benefit so a downstairs room doesn't
feel like a basement, just by adding full-height windows to brighten
the space.</TE>
<TE>   Although the book begins by explaining home site selection, the
primary focus is on the home's interior and use of the living spaces.
Drawings and color photos illustrate the topics.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Susanka's interior designs are ultra-practical but
obviously not for everyone. For example, she recommends a mudroom
design for kids to put their coats and belongings, with a separate
area for adult coats. Beneath the coats, there is room for a dog bed
and a storage area for dog food and dishes.</TE>
<TE>   She is very attentive to recycling. "It often amazes people to see
how little trash they actually generate when they fully engage in the
art of recycling," Suzanka writes. She shows how to create a
mail-sorting place with a trash bin for recycling junk mail.</TE>
<TE>   The chapter explaining how ceilings and their height influence a
room's feeling is perhaps the book's best. The author suggests
varying ceiling heights to distinguish spaces. "Take away the
variations in ceiling height, and the identities of the individual
spaces are seriously reduced," she says. Abundant use of soffits and
lowered ceilings to form alcoves are illustrated.</TE>
<TE>   This is an idea book for home builders and remodelers. Susanka
adapts many of her home building ideas for remodeling, such as adding
soffits to make an 8-foot ceiling feel taller. Even room additions
are explained, though without great detail.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike her earlier books, this one seems sparse on color photos
showing real-life implementations of the author's ideas. Although
Susanka's drawings are easy to understand and illustrate her
explanations well, more color photos showing her ideas in actual
homes would have greatly added to the book's usefulness. But her
practical and innovative suggestions overcome this deficiency. On my
scale of 1 to 10, this outstanding new book rates a solid 10.</TE>

<HD>Who's responsible for repairs? Usually, the landlord</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H. May Spitz</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the joys of tenant life is freedom from repairs and
maintenance. But not every tenant enjoys freedom from repair
aggravation. Some find their requests are ignored or the responses
are delayed.</LD>
<LD>   Tenant repair requests range from the legally required to the
simply desired.</LD>
<LD>   What landlord repairs are legally required? State and local
housing standards vary, but all require "habitability." More than
just a non-leaky roof over your head, habitability means fit for
occupation by human beings and in compliance with all health and
safety codes.</LD>
<TE>   California Civil Code details several basics, such as having hot
and cold water, and plumbing in good working order. The Uniform
Housing Code has more specific requirements, including water that
heats up to 110 degrees Fahrenheit. Cold showers are a violation of
any code.</TE>
<TE>   Codes also require that floors, stairways and railings be
maintained in good repair. Heating and lighting have to be kept in
good working order. Common areas are to be rodent free.</TE>
<TE>   Adequate weather protection is covered by state law, with broken
doors and windows a violation of code. Since July 1, 1998, an
operable deadbolt lock has been required on each swinging entry door.
Sliding doors are exempt (they just have to lock), and double
deadbolts are not permitted. Double deadbolts violate the fire safety
code.</TE>
<TE>   Tenants are required by code to notify an owner when a door or
window lock becomes inoperable. Owners are to provide working smoke
alarms and adequate trash containers.</TE>
<TE>   Owners are required to make repairs in a reasonable time, which is
not currently defined by State Civil Code. Basically, anything that
affects habilitation, including health and safety, should be
immediately requested for repair.</TE>
<TE>   Tone and attitude go a long way to getting things done. Try the
polite approach for requests. Be sure you communicate the problem
clearly.</TE>
<TE>   When you call for any reason, be specific. Explain exactly where
and what the problem is, and when you prefer someone come to make the
repair.</TE>
<TE>   The sooner you get your message across, the sooner your problem
can be fixed. If a verbal request is not fixed in a week, send a note
to whomever the rent is paid.</TE>
<TE>   Your lease may also detail repair requirements. Generally, if a
unit is rented with working fixtures and appliances, they are to
remain in good repair, compliments of your landlord. The tenant does
have a duty per state law to not further abuse or dilapidate a unit
or the fixtures.</TE>
<TE>   Emergency repairs call for special treatment. In case of fire or
burglary, dial 911. Define ahead of time with management where they
can be reached in case of an emergency.</TE>
<TE>   What counts as an emergency versus a casual problem? Water spewing
out of control is a plumbing emergency, according to plumbing
experts. The same idea applies to other scenarios. When the situation
is out of control and may cause damage or injury, it's usually an
emergency.</TE>
<TE>   Cosmetic repairs are rarely required unless they violate health or
safety code, such as peeling lead paint. Local ordinances vary. If
you want new carpet or paint, or any non-required change, consider
splitting the cost with the owner. No matter what the repair, some
owners wait for problems to accumulate before sending someone. Some
mom-and-pop type owners don't have the sources or resources.</TE>
<TE>   If you trust someone to do a repair, ask the owner if they would
prefer you take care of a specific problem. Get the answer in
writing.</TE>
<TE>   What if you ask for required repairs and are repeatedly ignored?
State Civil Code 1942 provides a "repair and deduct" remedy. Details
are complicated, but a basic overview can be accessed through the
Department of California Consumer Affairs Web site at
www.dca.ca.gov/legal. Local ordinances may have further detail. In
serious cases, you may want to contact a mediator or legal
professional.</TE>

<LD>With the resurgence of the cocktail in recent years-from green apple
martinis to Cosmopolitans and Manhattans-is it any wonder that bar
trolleys are making a comeback? Mobile and versatile, they range in
style from three-tiered, lacquered classics such as Vitra's recent
reissue of Verner Panton's 1963 Bar Boy, with space for bottles, nuts
and glasses, to Michael Heltzer's indoor-outdoor stainless steel
serving cart with pivoting front wheels for easy turning. Haus
Arrest's Rolletto cart with a glass bowl chills your bottle, while
Ross Lovegrove's birch plywood trolley features places for bottles
and a removable tray with spots for an ice bucket and plate of hors
d'oeuvres. And Italian designer Franco Raggi's Tazio Tre-a
transparent glass catering trolley-is ideal for showing off all those
colorful cocktail creations. So put on your dinner jacket, pour
yourself into that little black dress and step into another era.</LD>

<LD>If your hostess doesn't raise a brow when you spill red wine on her
grandmother's Jacquard, she may well be a regular at Crest Curtain &amp;
Drapery cleaners, the Los Angeles institution that specializes in
tender loving care for curtains and heirloom tablecloths.</LD>
<LD>   William Megowan Jr. operates the business that was founded in 1918
by his grandfather, Irwin Megowan. The Megowans eventually moved the
cleaners to Pico Boulevard in 1940 from its original digs in a
downtown commercial plant and have remained there since.</LD>
<LD>   "In the '20s and '30s, curtains and tablecloths were all real lace
and cotton, so they all had to be framed and blocked and stretched
for pressing," says Megowan. Today, his staff does things much the
same way with meticulous hand-framing and blocking on large tables in
the back room. It's a labor-intensive skill that has been passed down
from worker to worker, several of whom have been with Crest for more
than two decades.</LD>
<TE>   A full-size banquet cloth takes several days just to block and
press, in addition to a two-part shrinkage-free hand-laundering
process. By the time the cloth is finished, five or six employees
have worked on it. It takes two just to operate the irons, which
weigh 20 to 30 pounds. "We have one that weighs 40 pounds that's
basically made for linen. Linen holds its wrinkles, and you have to
use a lot of pressure," Megowan says. "We have all this old blocking
and framing equipment that we've had since the '30s, when everything
had to be done that way. It still works, so we still use it."</TE>

<HD>Fancy That!</HD>
<DH>Petits Fours Enjoy a Renaissance With Los Angeles Pastry
Chefs By Martin Booe</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN BOOE</AU>
<BD>Martin Booe, a frequent contributor to the magazine,
last wrote about spices.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"We went to the bakery and had espresso and petits fours," a friend
said to me recently. She was only describing her day, but this got me
to thinking. I hadn't thought of petits fours in years.</LD>
<LD>   "Why would you do that?" I asked.</LD>
<LD>   "Because they're delicious, and, all of a sudden, they're
everywhere."</LD>
<TE>   And, depending on your idea of a petit four, they are, indeed, all
over the place. You find them increasingly at high-end bakeries and
restaurants, such as Melisse, and especially at the better hotel
restaurants, such as the Gardens at the Four Seasons Hotel. They're
served as the overture to the full dessert.</TE>
<TE>   What I remember of petits fours would be best left to the trash
compactor of American culinary kitsch. A petit four, circa 1967 at
the height of its popularity, was essentially a miniature English tea
cake--a square inch of spongecake doused in a waxy, artificially
colored (usually pink or green) fondant, perhaps adorned on top with
some sort of decorative swirl. This was the stuff of bridal showers
and birthdays. My mother would order them from some specialty catalog
or another, mainly because her mother-in-law, one generation removed
from England, adored them.</TE>
<TE>   Or at least she professed to adore them. We all did. We adored
them because they were fancy, and, of course, we ourselves were fancy
people, and fancy people in general and our family in particular
liked fancy things with fancy French names.</TE>
<TE>   The box would arrive weeks later, and we would gather at the table
for coffee or milk and coo over our petits fours as all high-born
fancy people must. The fact was, we all secretly hated them. They
were desiccated and tasted like clumps of sawdust sweetened with
granulated sugar that had been glazed with resin.</TE>
<TE>   It would be misleading to say that petits fours--as I knew
them--are making a comeback in the United States, because until
fairly recently we never knew the real thing. In their country of
origin, they are something quite different. "Petit" means "little,"
and "four" means oven, so a petit four is a "little oven." As with
many things French, this makes absolutely no sense until you trace it
back to the 18th century. ''Little'' supposedly refers to the lower
heat in which the bite-sized and more fragile morsels were baked,
after the full-sized cakes and pastries came out of the oven. In
France, there are several styles. One is miniature reproductions of
individual cakes, such as baby eclairs and tartlets. Another is iced
or glazed petits fours, which are probably closest to the old-school
petits fours of my youth. They may be made of spongecake but are
filled or layered with marzipan or pastry cream. Some petits fours
are like little cookies. Others are candied fruits. And there is a
whole range of savory petits fours served with aperitifs and as hors
d'oeuvres. It is my observation that the first aforementioned
category--those mini pastries and fruit-topped tartlets--are the most
popular rendition.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, when it comes to anything to do with baking, we have
come a million miles since the days of those mail-order petits fours.
Bear claws no longer represent the peak pastry experience in America,
and Los Angeles is teeming with classically trained pastry chefs
continually uplifting our palates.</TE>
<TE>   Anna Delorefice, chef and co-owner of the recently opened
SugarPlum Bakery on Beverly Boulevard, is one of them. "I wasn't sure
people would really know what to do with them," she told me as I
surveyed the trove of dandified confections winking from behind the
glass bakery case. She needn't have worried. On this day, she'd
produced 900 for a special event but usually sells about 200 a day.
"It's like people were waiting for this. They're festive, and they're
delicious."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a bit like croissants and baguettes were when I first came
here from France 23 years ago," says Julian Bohbot of Delice, a
French kosher bakery on West Pico Boulevard. "They were unfamiliar
here. But with petits fours, people are learning quickly." You can
take the man out of France, but you can't take France out of the man.
Bohbot, a real estate agent, went into the bakery business because he
felt there was a dearth of French pastry in his neighborhood. He also
saw an unfulfilled demand for upscale kosher baked goods. So he
partnered with veteran baker Jacob Levy of the Eilat bakeries, who
found a way to make kosher petits fours and other pastries using
dairy substitutes. (Kosher dietary strictures prohibit the
consumption of dairy products after meat.) I tasted a mini-Napoleon.
Could've fooled me.</TE>
<TE>   The allure of French petits fours is the same as that of Spanish
tapas: You get to nibble on a lot of different things without filling
up on one big hulking dish. In France, petits fours sometimes serve
as a stand-in for dinners, says chef Ludovic Lefebvre. It's gustatory
promiscuity. I suppose there's a case to be made that the definition
of a petit four has expanded, even beyond the broad parameters of the
French. Lefebvre insists that a true petit four should be bite-sized,
small enough to pop into your mouth all at once. Many of the ones I
sampled, though, were a bit larger and required two bites. Oh well,
we do live in a Big Gulp nation, and it's no wonder that they've been
plus-sized along with everything else. On the other hand, maybe
American pastry chefs arrived at petits fours by shrinking
conventional pastries.</TE>
<TE>   Still, I was curious whether anybody was still making petits fours
as I once knew them. On a nostalgic whim, I popped in to the Rolling
Pin Bakeshop, a Dutch-American bakery in Atwater Village, and talked
to owner Antonette "Toni" Apostol. She is not Dutch, but Filipina,
and learned to make petits fours more than 15 years ago from the
previous owner, who was not Dutch, but German. (This is, after all,
Los Angeles.) Hers are made of spongecake, filled with apricot or
raspberry, topped with marzipan and may be dipped in chocolate. She
said she hadn't received a big order for them in a few years, and
would be happy to make some up for me. I happily placed an order.</TE>

<LD>Tke a tour of some of the trendier watering holes around town and
you'll discover that tradition has taken a back seat to glamour.
Pretty little drinks in candied hues are the concoctions of the
moment, and, unlike some sophisticated restaurant fare, it's OK to
try these at home. To keep your guests engaged and sated, six L.A.
bars share their favorite recipes for home entertaining.</LD>
<LD>   Alternative ingredients such as blood oranges, Meyer lemons and
cranberries are used to great effect--and taste. Consider Marix's
blood orange margarita, an unexpected twist on the genre. Or the
Avalon's pomegranate margarita, served in a glass rimmed with
rust-colored salt, or the pale-green mint gimlet, served in a
highball glass with fresh mint leaves. Over at Vine, the menu of
soju-based offerings in an array of hues and flavors presents
intriguing alternatives to vodka-based cocktails, but with half the
alcohol. At Forty Deuce, the Lemon Drop is garnished with a sparkly
rim of sugar and a wedge of lemon. Deep's Moody Blue Martini is made
with raspberry vodka, which is sure to lift your spirits.</LD>
<LD>   And, if you just can't part with the classics, you might want to
accessorize that little black dress with one of Linq's Mystique
cocktails involving black vodka and a splash of cassis. After all,
black is still the new black. It just depends on how daringly you
choose to wear it.</LD>

<DH>L.A.'s Leading Caterers Serve Up Some Innovative Hors
D'Oeuvres</DH>

<BD>Amelia Saltsman last wrote for the magazine about
Persian mulberries.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We adore hors d'oeuvres. Just witness the popularity of "small
plates" at parties around the city. Perhaps it's because these little
bites transport us to a soigne world where we socialize brilliantly.
But as with most things elegant, there's an art to effortless grace.</LD>
<LD>   "It takes time and creativity to make something small and
beautiful," says caterer Kai Loebach of Kai's European Catering and
Event Design. A little goes a long way; the memory of one kimchi crab
cake should haunt, leaving guests eager for the next taste. "Provide
many such subtle surprises throughout the evening," says longtime
caterer Andrea Bell. Loebach adds that "you create different moods
and movement by having sushi in one room and hot shabu-shabu bubbling
in another."</LD>
<LD>   From ethnic to elegant (but not mutually exclusive), hip to homey,
and budget to blowout, here's a week's worth of L.A.'s best bites.</LD>
<TE>   The more-is-more Park Plaza Events does everything from
million-dollar parties for Microsoft to $500 tidbits-to-go for
smaller parties through their Hors D'oeuvre Store at the 1925
Syrian-Grecian-Renaissance Park Plaza Hotel (under renovation)
overlooking MacArthur Park. Hotel event planner Connie Armijo and
hotelier Chavi Hertz offer "square deviled eggs," coconut shrimp

<TE>   Loebach's precision training and exuberant imagination make him
popular with celebrity clients. "You have to wow guests like Brad and
Jennifer," he says. Smoked salmon and creme fraiche in delicate
pastry cones served in antique wooden test tube trays; indulgent
Yukon gold mashed potatoes with creamed spinach and crisp prosciutto
in demitasse cups; and pigs in puff pastry blankets served with green
or purple ketchup are a few of the delicacies he offers. You can also
have crudites "growing" from wheat grass centerpieces.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood's trendy Ammo cafe takes a more straightforward
approach. "When celebrities hire us for personal events, they want
cozy, relaxed parties," says catering director Wade Williams. Owner
Amy Sweeney shops the farmers' markets to dish up seasonal radicchio,
avocados and chives with Parmigiano-Reggiano on spicy Ammo crackers;
maple-glazed duck on sweet potato chips with pomegranate; and potato
pancakes with caramelized apples and cipollini compote.</TE>
<TE>   At Temple, you can entertain your fashionista friends in the
lounge or bring home the restaurant's Asian tapas and make your own
Soju Caipirinhas (martini-like cocktails of Korean sweet potato
vodka, lime, sugar and mint). Sibling restaurateurs Jun and Soyon Kim
filter their native Korean appetizers through a Brazilian lens:
kimchi crab cakes, crispy rock shrimp dumplings, soju-steamed mussels
with Brazilian salsa, and beef sam bap (seasoned rice, miso and
grilled beef in lettuce).</TE>
<TE>   Angeli Caffe's Evan Kleiman has a "secret kitchen" where she veers
from her normal rustic Italian cooking and turns out gutsy Middle
Eastern mezze and Spanish tapas such as spiced olives, Manchego
cheese with quince paste, and paprika-grilled shrimp with
anchovy-stuffed olives. Other popular antipasti include a potato
croquette with salami and smoked mozzarella; a saffron risotto
croquette with mozzarella, eggplant and Parmiagiano-Reggiano; an herb
polpette; and a radicchio-wrapped balsamic chicken with raisins and
pine nuts.</TE>
<TE>   Like Kleiman, Andrea Bell has been on the food scene since the
early '80s. Versatile, attentive and innately elegant, her L.A.
Celebrations! gets raves from everyone from Rita Wilson and Tom Hanks
to bar mitzvah moms. One taste of Bell's bite-size blinis and
barquettes with white asparagus, seared foie gras on brioche toast or
casual crab-and-black-bean quesadillas will tell you why.</TE>
<TE>   There are countless ways to amaze your friends' palates during the
holiday season, whether at fantasia venues or in your own living
room. Be it tray-passed or self-serve, tuxedoed or in jeans, how you
choose to serve these little bites is a matter of taste.</TE>

<HD>The Iceman Cometh</HD>
<DH>Sculptor Mark Daukas' Frozen Creations Thaw the Room</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Thornburg</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Party planners and hostesses in the know ask Mark Daukas to bring the
ice. An ice sculptor, Daukas has been chipping away at the meltable
medium since he worked as a cook at the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel
&amp; Tennis Club 25 years ago. "One of the chefs there taught me what he
knew," says the sculptor. "There were no schools--you learned from
others and by experimenting."</LD>
<LD>   After a year and a half of making ice sculptures for Sunday
brunches and special events, he opened his own ice-sculpting
business, Mark Daukas Designs in Costa Mesa. And when he learned that
the kit of Japanese chisels he needed for sophisticated carving ran
upward of $5,000, he decided to invent his own. Transforming die
grinders, right-angle grinders and Dremel tools commonly used in
metal and woodworking into ice-specific tools, he pioneered new
methods in the frozen art form. A much-copied technique for making
graphics by cutting out a cavity and filling it with packed snow is
known in the ice biz as the Daukas Snowfill technique. Lately, an
encased-relief technique akin to etching glass has caught his
fascination. "I cut open an ice block and sculpt the inside--it's
like carving backward. Then I put it back together," says Daukas.
"That's the hard part."</LD>
<TE>   The first American to win the prestigious world championship of
ice carving in Asahikawa, Japan, and six-time national champion,
Daukas' portfolio showcases numerous cool creations. The largest
piece he recalls: two 20-by-40-foot clashing T-rexes at an ice
carnival in Pennsylvania. "You could walk through an archway between
them," Daukas says. "It took 30 workers to construct and another week
to carve the 1,000 blocks of ice" that weighed 300 pounds each.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most requested pieces is his colorful ice bar with
luges. The piece weighs in at about 350 pounds; he first designs it
on his computer and then carves one block at a time, assembling the
piece like a large puzzle in his 15-by-20-foot walk-in freezer. The
bar sits atop a special drip tray/lighting pedestal he devised to
light the ice as well as capture water as it melts. The luge, named
after the racing sled on which a rider lies face up while sliding
down an icy chute, sits atop the bar. Spirits are poured into a
chilled bottle, encased upside down in the ice with its base drilled
out, to end up in a guest's waiting glass. Bars last up to 12 hours,
depending on the temperature conditions.</TE>

<DH>Custom Invitations Create Ambience From the Start</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY YOUNG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So you want your party to be an affair to remember. Instead of
settling for something off the rack (sorry, Hallmark), get personal.
How better to set the tone than by having a card designed to reflect
your own unique style, from the paper and ink to the imagery and
message? With custom invitations, choices range from parchment to
gold leaf, neutral to Day-Glo bright, classic to kitsch. Almost
anything is possible.</LD>
<LD>   Invitations change with the times, of course. In recent decades,
they've evolved from over-the-top '80s glitz to nature-inspired '90s
simplicity. To find out what's current, we checked with three top
sources of high-end custom cards, each with a different specialty.
Prices per invitation range from $5 to the-sky's-the-limit, depending
on quantity, complexity and materials.</LD>
<TE>   By printing her invitations on an old-fashioned letterpress and
occasionally accenting them with antique cords and trinkets, designer
Claudia Laub turns out exquisite cards with a decidedly vintage edge.
"Letterpress is for the antique-ophile," she says. "The type 'bites'
into the paper and creates texture." Laub says her Hancock Park
studio and gallery has been getting requests for more festive
invitations after a period of subdued designs. "I'm seeing color in
papers and inks again--oranges, greens, mauves and purples." While
accordion pleats are gaining popularity, so are single cards left
unfolded. "In this economy, people are scaling back, but they'll
spend on hand coloring," she says. For one set of bat mitzvah
invitations, Laub painstakingly dotted watercolor on an intricate
printed design. "It took forever, but they turned out gorgeous."</TE>
<TE>   At Hiromi Paper International in Santa Monica, owner Hiromi
Katayama stocks more than 500 handmade Japanese papers that are
masterpieces in and of themselves. Little wonder that Katayama and
her staff feature the papers' delicate fibers, hand-dyed hues and
woodblock-printed patterns in their custom invitation designs. "The
customers we attract here [at Bergamot Station] are artistically
inclined," says graphic designer Silvia Capistran, who collaborates
with card designer Tania Baban. "Very often, they're content to let
the paper stand alone."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Katayama says, some folks insist on gilding the lily,
layering several papers in the same color palette or adding silk
ribbons and dried blooms. Hiromi Paper's most requested extras are
origami flowers and birds that can be glued on or included as
separate ornaments.</TE>
<TE>   Despite designing the new Pottery Barn paper line of
fill-in-the-blank invites and writing a book on invitations, Marc
Friedland of Creative Intelligence in Los Angeles continues to create
one-of-a-kind cards with themes that extend to party decor. Not long
ago, he created a slick, tech-oriented invitation, then translated
its green-and-white circle motifs into bubbling table centerpieces:
fish aquariums inside empty iMac computer monitors. Friedland reports
the rise of the color combos pink and gray, and baby blue and
chocolate brown; simple typefaces; and tailored rather than craftsy
styles, a trend that's a far cry from wilder past projects involving
such flourishes as an actual stiletto pump (white with pink fur) and
a mini treasure chest. "Custom invitations aren't so much about being
lavish anymore," he says. "They're more about being heartfelt and
communicating shared experiences. The nice thing is, they become
keepsakes years later."</TE>

<DH>Dinner parties are back, but formality is not. Think
intimate late-night gatherings with an eclectic guest list and a
surprising presentation. In the pages that follow, Southern
Californians show us the next wave of party-giving.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LANSING</AU>
<BD>David Lansing last wrote for the magazine on home
offices.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's this actress, I tell Tim Hosier, manager of the boutique home
store Maison Midi, who, according to a story I read in the New York
Times, throws 15 dinner parties during her season in New York City,
which runs from September through May.</LD>
<LD>   "Yes?" Tim says, only half-listening as he pulls from the shelf
two delicate Moroccan tea glasses I am purchasing for a dinner party
of my own.</LD>
<LD>   "She never plays music at her parties because she thinks it's
distracting, and she doesn't serve hors d'oeuvres because she thinks
they just fill people up."</LD>
<TE>   "And?" Hosier says, holding up the glasses for me to admire.</TE>
<TE>   "And she always serves the exact same dinner menu--chicken, rice,
and peas."</TE>
<TE>   I tell Tim this story because, like a lot of people, I'm finding
more excuses to entertain at home these days rather than go out. But
I worry that my parties are not structured enough--not as formal as
they should be.</TE>
<TE>   "She sounds like the party hostess from hell," he says, wrapping
my new finds in brown tissue paper. "That's not at all how we throw
parties in Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   I ask him how it's done. "A good party should be casual but
elegant," Hosier says.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that people are doing more entertaining at home seems
indisputable, though whether that's a result of a softening economy
and a born-again passion for smelling the roses along the way or
simply the logical offspring of Martha Stewart-cocooning and smart
retail marketing, as trend analyst and retail consultant David Wolfe
contends, is up for debate. "People definitely are buying more of
what's known as 'tablescapes'--all those accessories for setting the
table: napkin rings, very ornate napkins and place mats, huge wine
glasses and goblets. We now have to have a whole wardrobe of table
settings. And with so many gourmet prepared foods available, it's
easy to give a really nice dinner party."</TE>
<TE>   Hosting a dinner party may be easy, but there's still an art to
entertaining and anyone who's ever left a party shaking their head
while mumbling to a companion "What was that all about?" knows
exactly what I mean. "A good host or hostess is like a movie director
or the choreographer for a show," says David Tutera, who, in addition
to writing "A Passion for Parties," has made a name for himself as an
event planner to the stars.</TE>
<TE>   Like Hosier, Tutera sees a big difference in the trends between
East and West Coast entertaining. "We don't really go for the
three-hour dinner with multiple courses in LA," he says. "People want
to move around and mingle. And chicken and peas would never do. I go
for fun food."</TE>
<TE>   Which is why he recommends late-night dessert parties,
particularly during the holidays. "That way people don't have to be
so time conscious about when they get there, and it allows them to
sneak out of some other party if it's bad." A favorite Tutera concept
is to host a party with a self-service bar stocked with specialty
dessert drinks, such as peppermint martinis, and let the guests help
themselves. "I'll put the recipes in frames and prop them on the bar
and watch while everyone plays bartender. It's hilarious."</TE>
<TE>   Cocktails, of course, remain the fun element at a good party
whether you're serving sparkling wine or something a little more
interesting, such as a black martini.</TE>
<TE>   In today's market the demand is increasing for wine goblets that
are 16 or even 24 ounces; updated Casablanca highball glasses tinted
purple, in a nod to retro styles; and oversized martini glasses named
Garbo or Rhapsody that look like angular flower vases on stems.</TE>
<TE>   But bigger doesn't necessarily mean splashier or gaudy.
"Entertaining is all about fun these days because people aren't
trying so hard to impress anyone," says Bette Kahn, a spokeswoman for
Crate &amp; Barrel's corporate headquarters in Chicago. Toward that end,
the company has reintroduced housewares--such as red enamelware from
Dansk--that it hasn't carried in more than 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   Diane Worthington, a food writer and author of 15 books on cooking
and entertaining, including her newest, "Seriously Simple: Easy
Recipes for Creative Cooks," agrees that "casual elegance" best sums
up her favorite dinner parties. "Entertaining in Southern California
is definitely less uptight," she says from her home in the San
Fernando Valley. "People don't want fancy sterling at the table and
they don't want to eat big, heavy meals. We want fun dishes. I'll
make a Mediterranean chicken with olives, which can be made ahead,
and serve it with roasted vegetables. Or butternut squash soup with
chipotle cream in bright, colorful bowls."</TE>
<TE>   Remember the purpose of hosting any sort of party, says
Worthington. "You want to provide an intimate setting that encourages
lively conversation. You want people to enjoy themselves. And nobody
will have a good time if the host is stressed out."</TE>
<TE>   Which is why, if she's throwing a party for more than 20 people,
Worthington prefers to just rent everything from a party supplier
such as Regal Rents or Classic Party Rentals. "For a couple hundred
dollars, they'll provide you with everything you need--napkins,
glasses, plates, settings--and then you don't have to run everything
through your dishwasher. Just rinse it off and put it back in the
boxes."</TE>
<TE>   "Details are important, but that doesn't mean you need to be fussy
about everything or buy all new stuff," says Gia Russo, a former
editor at Martha Stewart Living, who, with Michele Adams, another
former Stewart acolyte, wrote "At Home With Friends: Spontaneous
Celebrations for Any Occasion." Russo and Adams, who have done
styling for several magazines, including this one, believe that
"casual" doesn't mean ignoring the fundamentals of entertaining: good
food, good drinks and a cozy atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   "You can get creative with things you already have around your
house," says Russo. Like grouping small bowls filled with coarse
salt, freshly ground pepper and fresh herbs on a pretty tray or
platter. Or using a simple centerpiece with lots of candles. The idea
is to make everyone feel relaxed and comfortable during a party.</TE>
<TE>   And the music? "Music is the heartbeat of a good
party--particularly a small party," says planner David Tutera. "A
party without good music is like a party without good food. Why
bother?"</TE>
<TE>   So I'll greet my guests at the door, whenever they arrive, and
we'll take our time over some simple appetizers--perhaps stuffed
olives and rounds of toasted La Brea Bakery rustic bread topped with
shavings of Parmigiano-Reggiano--and I'll serve takeout Thai on some
inexpensive black lacquered plates I bought at a flea market. We'll
toast the guests of honor with sparkling wine in ruby-colored
Moroccan tea glasses while, in the background, Pink Martini sings an
ironic version of "Que Sera Sera."</TE>
<TE>   It's not the sort of party I imagine the actress from New York
would enjoy. But then again, I'd never invite her.</TE>

<LD>Whatever the occasion, designer Nay Khoubnazar never fails to bring a
touch of class to the table--literally. Khoubnazar's linen and
organdy napkins, place mats, cloths and runners come embellished with
embroidery, lace, organza and other couture-like details. Not
surprisingly, her creations turn up on some of the best-dressed
tabletops in town.</LD>
<LD>   "The things I make are like fashion for the table," she says. "I
watch the styles in magazines. If there's anything I can transfer, I
do." Like dainty floral appliques. Or hand-stitched rows of pastel
ribbon. Or exotic fringes of faceted beads.</LD>
<LD>   Khoubnazar launched her linens company, Nay et al Inc., in 1993
while working at Gearys of Beverly Hills. "I kept telling my bosses
we didn't have anything to go with a Lynn Chase china pattern called
Jaguar Jungle that had a black border with leopard print and
orchids," she recalls. "They dared me to make something myself. So I
did."</LD>
<TE>   That night, Khoubnazar borrowed her sister's sewing machine and
whipped up black sateen place mats with black cording. Her elegantly
understated handiwork was an instant hit at Gearys, and the next
thing Khoubnazar knew, Neiman Marcus was on the phone with a huge
order.</TE>
<TE>   The Iranian-born designer now heads a 12-person company based near
USC, and has since introduced 20 more collections. Nay et al can be
found at Gearys, For the Table on Robertson Boulevard and specialty
stores across the country. For those tempted to trade up from paper,
a set of eight napkins, napkin rings and place mats could put you

<TE>   Not that Khoubnazar's customers mind. "There will always be people
who set a beautiful table for holidays and special occasions," she
says. Which explains why she reserved space for linens in the Santa
Monica boutique she opened last month for her Baby Nay children's
clothing line (also available at select Bloomingdale's stores). "I'll
never stop designing for the table because, nine years ago, it all
started with a napkin and a napkin ring."</TE>

<LD>Whether you're hosting Thanksgiving dinner for the family, a holiday
buffet for 50 or a romantic dinner for two, setting an artful table
is a very personal, freewheeling affair. It's about setting a scene.</LD>
<LD>   As in contemporary fashion, steadfast rules--matching napkins and
tablecloths, as well as the requisite centerpiece with three tall
tapers--are passe. An array of props--candles, flowers and vases,
china and crystal, napkins and tablecloths, place cards and party
favors--can be seamlessly woven together to create a mood. Table
settings are, of course, as variable as the hosts and hostesses who
set them. But whether simple or grand, party planners agree, the
memorable ones are imbued with a sense of personal panache.</LD>
<TE>   For florist Kimm Birkicht of The Velvet Garden in Los Angeles,
setting an artful table is all about the details--a handmade
tablecloth of moss and succulents, a pretty napkin wrapped in an
exotic leaf, a chair festooned with flowers for the guest of honor.
Birkicht, who previously worked in fashion and store display, is
known for her zany combinations of flowers with objects: Wheat grass
and pink poodles, Eiffel Tower candles and colorful bird feathers,
ribbon-and-crystal magic wands and a bed of pink roses. "Setting the
table is a lot more than a vase with flowers and a few plates. It's
about setting a mood, telling a story," Birkicht says. "Some of the
best tables are when people bring in their own vases or ask us to
design a table around something they collect. Everything is handmade
and personal. It makes people feel special."</TE>
<TE>   Bicoastal party planner Colin Cowie, whose new book, "Dinner After
Dark," is about "sexy, sumptuous supper soirees" says he rarely
decorates his own dinner table with flowers. "Once you have a florist
do $350 of cut flowers, your impromptu dinner becomes an event. I
take things from around the house--a sculpture from the mantle, a
wood bowl I line with monstera leaves and then fill with limes,
coconuts and sliced kiwi fruit for a quick centerpiece. It makes the
table look sensuous instead of catered."</TE>
<TE>   For party planner and caterer Andrea Bell of L.A. Celebrations!, a
beautiful table setting is about textures, layers, colors and
nuances. For her own family Thanksgiving, she seats everyone at the
same table--"no matter how many." She decorates the table top with
seeds, pods and leaves she gathers from neighborhood sycamore and
liquidambar trees. Spicy vanilla and cinnamon-scented votives inside
baby pumpkins pepper the table. "An artful table appeals to all your
senses," Bell says. "It's what you see, feel, smell, taste." Event
planner Mary Micucci of Along Came Mary develops a central theme with
continuity and balance. "It's paramount to setting the scene," she
says. For her best friend's 40th birthday she selected an informal
Tuscan dinner with guests sitting in the garden under trees filled
with lanterns. A 32-foot-long linen handkerchief runner extended the
length of the table; terra-cotta pots filled with multicolored roses
and votive lights decked the top. "We let people sit where they
wanted and served family style," she says. "The minute you start to
pass plates of food, it breaks the ice. It makes everyone feel like
they are part of a family."</TE>
<TE>   Florist Suzane LeMay of Les Sculptures Vivantes in Los Angeles
likes an eclectic look, mixing glassware and china in different
colors and patterns. For a Mexican dinner party, she arranged an
array of south-of-the-border patterned chargers topped with a rainbow
of solid plates in bright red, yellow, green and blue. Junky goblets
and napkins in the same hues kept company with sunflowers and bunches
of red and yellow roses in colorful pitchers. "Personally, I don't
like things too matchy and perfect. Dressing a table is like dressing
yourself--some people wear a Chanel suit with matching shoes and
handbag. But a Chanel suit and a Fruit of the Loom T-shirt conveys
much more personality and style."</TE>
<TE>   Florist Clifford Miller of TFS (The Flower Shop) in West Hollywood
sets tables with unexpected pieces. For the holidays he pulls out his
great-grandmother Mami's antique Limoges and fills the soup tureen
with flowers and the gravy boat and teacups with moss. An old pickle
jar with a silver fork never fails to prompt conversation, he says.
"They're objects for the eye to play with."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the artful table is a very personal affair. What
matters most, it seems, is to convey thought, warmth and a reflection
of your own individual style.</TE>

<LD>Kelly Wearstler and Brad Korzen have had four birthday parties for
their son, Oliver, who is 4 1/2 months old. "We like to have a good
time," Korzen says.</LD>
<LD>   Wearstler, who is becoming as well known for her party acumen as
she is for her interior design abilities, has a formula of sorts.
"You need good people, good music and good food, but not heavy stuff
that will weigh people down and make them tired and want to go home,"
she says.</LD>
<LD>   Oliver's last party was in France. "We couldn't find any cake or
even a cupcake," Korzen says. "So we bought a huge loaf of bread and
stuck candles in it."</LD>
<TE>   Oliver also will be in his parents' wedding, the guest list for
which is reportedly spinning out of control. Wearstler and Korzen are
not ones to stand too firmly on formality. "If they like you, they
include you," says children's clothing designer Stacey Zinman, one of
Wearstler's friends. "They are two of the sweetest people you will
ever meet."</TE>
<TE>   And two of the most game, since scant days before her wedding
Wearstler seems not the least bit interested in curbing her impulse
to throw people together. What you see in the following pages is not
the rehearsal dinner; it's not even one of the official wedding week
parties. No, the stylish gathering</TE>
<TE>   in the bar of Santa Monica's Viceroy Hotel is vintage Kelly
Wearstler and an en pointe example of a new trend in entertaining: a
last-minute, casual gathering.</TE>
<TE>   Five days before her wedding?</TE>
<TE>   She laughs. "You know, I really didn't think the wedding would be
as complicated as it's turned out to be. It's a real production." The
social doyenne in the making laughs at her own naivete. "Sometimes I
wonder if we should have eloped."</TE>
<TE>   Wearstler is an effortless socializer, introducing people,
building conversational bridges and moving on as people gel. She grew
up in Myrtle Beach, S.C., which may have something to do with the
"get-on-the-bus" spirit that her gatherings have. "It was a really
quaint little town when I lived there," she says of the now-teeming
East Coast resort. "We used to have beach parties and keg parties all
the time." Which may be why calling her parties and her circle "chic"
is doing them a disservice. They're more than chic; they're fun. And
Wearstler seems to know that fun is what makes people want to come
back. What's more, she's beautiful and petite, with a mane of thick
auburn hair and cheekbones you could cut ice on. Korzen, in turn, is
lean and pale in that Romantic Hero way, with an equally impressive
mop of curly brown hair.</TE>
<TE>   Hate them yet? We're just getting started.</TE>
<TE>   At 38, real estate developer Korzen has created a series of smart
boutique hotels, including the Viceroy, the Avalon and Maison 140 in
Beverly Hills, and Estrella in Palm Springs. He is also currently
developing the Mobil Oil property downtown as a living/work loft
space. So far he has cultivated a reputation for creating
design-sensitive projects that also make money. At 33, Wearstler
heads up KWID (Kelly Wearstler Interior Design), a company whose
projects have included the interiors of Korzen's hotels and a handful
of apartment buildings. Her work--most simply described as
eclectic--has received international attention. She also has a book
coming out this spring from Regan Books called "Unexpected Style."</TE>
<TE>   The two are renovating and restoring a modernist home in Trousdale
Estates that they bought from the original owner. "It hasn't been
touched since 1956," Wearstler says. "We were so lucky."</TE>
<TE>   Not bad for two people who arrived here--he's from Chicago, she
was living in New York--just eight years ago. They met when Korzen
hired her to do the interior design for his house. "We were friends
first," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Wearstler is sitting on a sofa in the lobby of the Viceroy. Seated
next to her is Zinman, owner of the Bloomlove children's clothing
line, who is holding forth on how Wearstler helped her start her
business. "You know, nobody ever thought I could do anything," says
Zinman. "Kelly just opened her book and said, 'Let's see who can
help.' She's that kind of person. And look at her!" she says with a
laugh. Wearstler, who is deep in conversation with another friend and
unaware that Zinman is remarking on her style, perks up and asks,
"What are y'all laughing at?" She follows up with a query regarding
whether her outfit, which includes a Merry Widow from Agent
Provocateur (she pronounces it "Agent ProvokaTOOR"), is compromising
her modesty.</TE>
<TE>   She poses the question, however, in a much more direct way, which
is unprintable in this magazine. The effect, though, is funny and
endearing--someone with a bawdy sense of humor who is happy to laugh
at herself. Korzen arrives at the party a little late, looks her over
and says, "Darling, you look stunning." Wearstler replies, "Thank
yew, honey." And Korzen runs off to take care of some hotel business.</TE>
<TE>   These are two people who seem to feel no need to be glued at the
hip, but over the course of the evening, whenever they do find
themselves together, Korzen quietly takes Wearstler's hand. Their
social circle is drawn from business (him) and art, design and
fashion circles (her). He is still close with friends from college
(University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) and law school
(University of Miami), but tonight, says Wearstler, they have decided
to invite "people we like and want to get to know better."</TE>
<TE>   Among those present: David McCauley and Natasha Esch, both of whom
have their own interior design firms; architect Felix Pfeifle of Dean
Larkin Design, who is also McCauley's nephew; hairstylist Andy
Lecompte, who is doing Wearstler's hair for her wedding; Michael
DiCarlo, who is an executive assistant to a producer; event producer
Tony Schubert, who is producing the wedding; Gina Salerno, who sells
real estate and is co-owner of MediaRiot PR; fashion designer Trina
Turk, who hired Wearstler to design her Palm Springs store; and David
Serrano, co-owner of the Downtown furniture store. Missing is a
Hollywood contingent.</TE>
<TE>   It's an interesting choice of people in a town where success is
often seen as a zero-sum game and Hollywood is assumed to be a part
of that equation.</TE>
<TE>   McCauley explains it this way: "When she gets something, I'm
happy. When I get something, she's happy, and we help each other. We
all share resources. I don't know why everyone thinks there's not
enough success to go around." Esch met Wearstler at an Elle magazine
event, where, she says, "I think we were the two youngest people
there." Says McCauley, "She's not intimidated at all by other
people's success; she's incredibly supportive."</TE>
<TE>   While one of Korzen's best friends from college is a producer, he
says, "Hollywood is really peripheral to our lives."</TE>
<TE>   And that may be the beginning of a sea change in the way Los
Angeles is perceived both by the people who live here and the people
who don't. In the last century, conventional wisdom held that
Hollywood was the whole point of Los Angeles. And while it remains a
driving force in the city's cultural, social and economic life, the
city is gaining more and more respect as a breeding ground for
important innovations in art, design, fashion, literature, technology
and culture apart from the entertainment juggernaut. What else to
make of two successful, attractive young people who don't depend on
Hollywood for their living or social life?</TE>
<TE>   Salerno appears in the lobby wearing a hotel bathrobe to hoots and
catcalls. "What's with the bathrobe?" yells Pfeifle. "I'm freezing,"
she yells back, but off comes the robe, revealing a show-stopping,
up-to-here beaded gold dress. The crowd goes wild. "Oh, Gina, you
look awesome!" exclaims Wearstler.</TE>
<TE>   As the party dwindles, L.A.'s Smart Young Things gather on the
sofa with Wearstler and Korzen in the middle. Everyone is clowning
around, which leads to a situation that would be highly unlikely were
the hostess one of L.A.'s social Old Guard--be it on the Westside or
in San Marino.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Lecompte is upside-down leaning over the sofa. "Andy!"
Wearstler yells. "Turn around! How can we talk to you when you're
down there?"</TE>
<TE>   Lecompte does as he's instructed. Even hipster hostesses have
limits.</TE>

<HD>Sizing up the 800-pound gorillas of ski resorts</HD>
<DH>Downhill Slide: Why the Corporate Ski Industry Is Bad for
Skiing, Ski Towns, and the Environment, By Hal Clifford, Sierra Club:
256 pages, $24.95 Moon Handbooks: Guadalajara, By Bruce Whipperman,
Avalon Travel: 250 pages, $14.95 Asia Grace, By Kevin Kelly, Taschen:
320 pages, $40</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christopher Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here, if you're a troublemaker, is a volume to leave casually in the
conversation pit at your slope-side rental condo. But read it first.</LD>
<LD>   "Downhill Slide" is about the business of skiing and how the three
800-pound gorillas of the industry have seized upon the sport (and
its offspring, snowboarding) as a tool for the making of real estate
development fortunes.</LD>
<LD>   The gorillas are Intrawest Corp. (owner of Mammoth, among its many
resorts), Vail Resorts Inc. and American Skiing Co., which together
grossed nearly $1.8 billion in 2000, earning just under $300 million
in before-tax profits. Together they sell one of every four lift
tickets in the U.S., and in order to conduct business -- here's a
recurrent theme in the book -- they collectively lease 40,000 acres
from the U.S. Forest Service.</LD>
<TE>   The irony at the core of this book, and the ski resort industry
generally, is that, as author Hal Clifford gently puts it, "the ski
industry is dying." That is, while the U.S. population has been
galloping ahead for the last two decades, the number of
skier-and-snowboarder visits has remained essentially flat, and no
new major ski resorts have opened. But evidently many people need not
ski to enjoy a ski area. Demand for second homes in and around
mountain resorts is so strong that the big three are rushing to
expand resorts such as Mammoth, building and selling as many units as
neighbors and environmental laws will allow. (One side effect:
Service workers are forced out of town and into long-distance
commuting.)</TE>
<TE>   This is a tough, thoroughly reported book, and behind it stands an
author in love with skiing, alarmed by the social and environmental
implications of the evolution of the mountain resort business and
scornful of the faux villages popping up around the mountain West.</TE>
<TE>   My only quibble, and it depresses me to raise it, is Clifford's
assertion that these companies will achieve greater success, and
serve society better, if they pay more attention to what skiers want.
I'm not sure of that.</TE>
<TE>   As air travel grew easier and this country's passenger-rail
industry shriveled and mutated into always-unprofitable Amtrak three
decades ago, somebody said this of the rail companies: "They thought
they were in the railroad business. But really, they were in the
transportation business."</TE>
<TE>   The ski industry's big three, it seems, have realized they're not
in the ski business; they're in the business of keeping wealthy
Americans comfortable and amused on their vacations. That goal may
often prove problematic for plants, animals and human communities of
the rural mountain West, but it may well please the stockholders of
the big three.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Day by day, the terra to our south gets more cognita. Hence, after
years of guidebooks aimed broadly at Mexico or slightly more
specifically at Pacific Mexico, we now have the first edition of a
Moon guidebook aimed strictly at Guadalajara and its immediate
environs.</TE>
<TE>   This is good, and it's also good that author Bruce Whipperman is a
veteran of Mexico travel and fact-wrangling. He gives us not only the
usual hotel and restaurant survey but also an update on the
environmental trouble brewing as waters recede at Lake Chapala and
some sound words on spending practices. For instance: Many merchants
will happily accept dollars, but "you will nearly always save money
by insisting on paying in pesos."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Here are about 600 images of Asia, some stunning and moving, some
less so, wedged into about 320 unnumbered pages.</TE>
<TE>   Like conditions on the ground in many of these counties, the
resulting spectacle is chaotic. And like the employees of one of
those upscale mountain resorts where Hal Clifford has been
muckraking, the text of "Asia Grace" has been banished off campus.</TE>
<TE>   The book, clad in a gleaming pink-and-gold cover, holds nothing
but images within, most of them shot in the 1970s, some in the '80s
and '90s.</TE>
<TE>   For words to make further sense of the images, you have to find
your way to www.asiagrace.com, where you can learn that photography
is Kevin Kelly's second gig: He's better known as the co-founder of
Wired magazine. The Web site also offers caption information and
allows visitors to order signed ink-jet prints of images at $100
each.</TE>
<TE>   The book's pages include terraced rice paddies, soaring mosques
and sprawling deserts, covering 16 countries from Iran to Japan.</TE>
<TE>   It's an exhilarating but wearying journey. Like an overwhelmed
newcomer on the banks of the Ganges, I found myself craving fewer
images, more words and more order.</TE>

<LD>Much of our attention lately has been focused on the top fall and
winter transatlantic bargains: the Ireland fly-drives, the weeklong
air and hotel packages to London, Paris and Rome for far less than
you would have paid for air fare alone in summer.</LD>
<LD>   But the same factors that have driven down prices to London,
Paris, Ireland, Spain and Italy (Sept. 11 jitters and an economic
slowdown at home) have also made best buys out of the more remote
European destinations. Although they aren't as cheap as the more
renowned capitals, they're still enormous values in the
November-through-March period. Consider these deals in Turkey, Malta
and Prague/Budapest.</LD>
<LD>   Istanbul and a second Turkish city: For $855, Turkey specialist
Pacha Tours, (800) 722-4288, www.pachatours.com, is offering a
package that includes round-trip air on Turkish Airlines from LAX
through Dec. 14 and from Jan. 4 to March 25. The trip includes a
half-day Istanbul orientation tour and six nights in your choice of
18 Istanbul hotels, and one free round-trip ticket to a second city
in Turkey -- the capital, Ankara, or the port city of Izmir. The only
fine print is that you must book something in that second city
through Pacha: a sightseeing tour or perhaps your hotel. (Rates start
at $60.) Additional nights in Istanbul: from $30; single supplement,
$60.</LD>
<TE>   A week in Malta: Winter is a pleasant time in this colorful

<KH>Destination: Argentina</KH>
<HD>In Buenos Aires, bargain hunters say hello to good buys</HD>
<DH>The plunge of the peso means a happy kind of sticker shock
for tourists -- along with thrifty wining and dining.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Marshall S. Berdan</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>Buenos Aires</DL>
<LD>First we looked at the bill. Then my wife and I looked at each other
in disbelief. This was, after all, Cabana las Lilas, one of the
trendiest parrillas in Puerto Madero, Buenos Aires' trendiest
neighborhood. Dinner in the parrilla, or grilled meat house, was our
first in the capital, and Stacie and I had just splurged for two
gaucho-sized T-bone steaks and a bottle of Mendoza Malbec, a spunky
red from Argentina's premier wine-growing area. The bill barely crept
over $30.</LD>
<LD>   In Argentina, sticker shock is a recurring pleasure for foreign
visitors. So pleased were we that right after the meal we bought four
bottles of 1993 Saint Felicien, a Cabernet Sauvignon, at a posh wine
boutique in Recoleta, Buenos Aires' equivalent of New York's tony
Upper East Side. We paid less than $10 a bottle.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, we could have spent a lot more. We could have bought
fancy wines from France or California, imports with prices similar to
what we would have paid at home -- and would have paid here only a
year ago. And therein lies the primary lesson: The brute strength of
the dollar here and the resulting bargain bonanza for visitors
applies only to Argentine products and services.</LD>
<TE>   We learned these tips and more in August, when I celebrated my
birthday by tagging along with Stacie on her business trip. Just
about everything -- meals, drinks, leather jackets, purses, crafts --
was as little as one-third of its 2001 price in dollars, whether at
the celebrated Feria de San Telmo (San Telmo Flea Market) or Buenos
Aires' downtown Microcentro, where 11 blocks of the pedestrian avenue
Florida are filled with street vendors, upscale boutiques and
everything in between.</TE>
<TE>   The peso's woes</TE>
<TE>   How did the Paris of South America become the Costco of the
continent? Internal corruption and mismanagement, predatory
international lending and just plain bad luck, a friend and former
World Bank analyst told me over beer and sandwiches at Cafe Tortoni,
a gem along Buenos Aires' architectural showcase, Avenida de Mayo.</TE>
<TE>   The denouement has been painful: In January the government was
forced to abandon its decade-long charade that the Argentine peso is
equal to the American dollar. The peso plummeted. By the time the
dust had settled, one dollar bought more than three pesos.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, this gain for overseas tourists comes at the expense of
portenos, the city's residents. Unemployment is around 20%.
Especially hard hit are those who poured in from the countryside,
where the situation is worse.</TE>
<TE>   Though crime has surged, the increase is largely attributed to
petty theft, fraud and vandalism. Other than the anti-Yankee graffiti
that adorn foreign investment houses and boarded-up bank windows, we
noticed few signs of bad times. And despite the earnest solicitations
to "be careful out there" from Stacie's Argentine business
colleagues, we felt in no danger during our four days.</TE>
<TE>   Buenos Aires has two distinct personalities: the bustling,
get-it-done-now mode of Monday through Saturday, and the let-it-slide
attitude of Sunday. We arrived late on a Saturday, so it was our
pleasure to see this metropolis' more relaxed face first.</TE>
<TE>   Our initial stop Sunday was the Feria de San Telmo, Buenos Aires'
traditional smorgasbord of antiques stalls, street performers and
sidewalk cafes in the small, tree-shaded Plaza Dorrego.</TE>
<TE>   For more than a century, locals have come here to browse, bargain
and buy from 200-plus stalls selling everything from heirloom jewelry
to just plain junk. It's a must-see on tourists' itineraries, though
non-Argentines are not likely to appreciate the historical value of
gaucho art, old tango records and other items.</TE>
<TE>   During our two-hour reconnaissance, we saw quite a few things of
interest. I was struck by the fact that no dealer responded to my
palpably poor Spanish with outrageously inflated first price quotes.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most pored-over merchandise was memorabilia related to
Evita Peron and Carlos Gardel, the man largely credited for
popularizing tango in the early 1900s. The items ranged from original
press clippings to more recent, kitschy collector's items. I found
myself more engaged by rows of brightly colored seltzer bottles
(about $3 to $8) and the free tango show put on by professionals.</TE>
<TE>   For those willing to wander farther afield, a larger Sunday market
is held in Belgrano, a neighborhood about five miles northwest of the
downtown core. More than 500 dealers set up in Plaza Belgrano.
Antiques are available, but the emphasis is on handicrafts.</TE>
<TE>   The bustle downtown</TE>
<TE>   Come Monday, Buenos Aires was back to business as usual, which for
us meant more shopping. The city's main retail area down is called
Microcentro. The main drag is Florida, a pedestrian thoroughfare that
stretches nearly a mile between Avenida de Mayo to the south and
Plaza San Martin to the north. Here and on a cross street, Lavalle,
you'll find scruffy street vendors who spread blankets on the
sidewalk as well as the designer houses of Galerias Pacifico, Buenos
Aires' swankiest indoor mall.</TE>
<TE>   Goods ranged from cheap cotton socks to sterling silver polo pony
bits. The best buys were leather products: jackets, shoes, belts,
wallets, purses and a dizzying assortment of other things that you
never thought could -- or should -- be made of cowhide (men's
briefs). Prices as low as $35 for a pair of tasseled calfskin loafers
and $10 for a well-crafted belt were enough to make shoppers sing
Argentina's praises like a latter-day Evita.</TE>
<TE>   There's more: Listed prices (no bargaining here) already include
the hefty 21% VAT (also called the IVA), the national value-added
tax. And if your purchase is more than $70, you can get about
three-quarters of that fee refunded at the airport, provided you can
present both parts of your receipt, the bill (factura) and the cheque
de reintegro certification, at customs before you go through passport
control.</TE>
<TE>   Buenos Aires has other popular commercial districts: Palermo Viejo
in the posh Palermo neighborhood; Arenales, a street in the
middle-class Barrio Norte district; or anywhere along Avenida
Corrientes, home to many of the city's remarkable collection of
bookstores.</TE>
<TE>   After a full day on your feet, you'll be happy to just sit and
watch the fancy footwork at one of Buenos Aires' dinner and tango
shows. Most don't start until around 10 p.m., so they won't interfere
with evening shopping. And since the price has dropped from about
$100 per person to about $30, you can splurge for that bottle of
Mendoza Malbec.</TE>

<TE>   Shopping Argentina</TE>
<TE>   GETTING THERE:</TE>
<TE>   From LAX: LanChile offers direct (at least one stop but no change
of planes) and connecting (change of planes) service to Buenos Aires;
American, Delta, United and VARIG offer connecting service.
Restricted round-trip fares begin at $538.</TE>
<TE>   SHOPPING TIPS:</TE>
<TE>   Credit cards: Inquire about policies before buying anything.
Because of deteriorating exchange rates and administrative costs
imposed by credit card companies, many merchants levy a 5% to 10%
surcharge on credit transactions.</TE>
<TE>   Tax reimbursement: On some purchases, foreign shoppers are
entitled to a partial reimbursement of the 21% sales tax. Before
returning home, allow enough time at the airport to fill out the
paperwork, which is done before you enter passport control.</TE>
<TE>   Restaurants: Tip in cash. Otherwise many restaurants and other
service establishments will skim a substantial percentage off the
top.</TE>
<TE>   Hotels: Try to stay at an Argentine-owned hotel. You'll find that
favorable changes in the value of the peso are more visible at
mid-to-upscale domestic properties (averaging about $50 per night)
than at international chains (about $150).</TE>

<HD>On the Central Coast, a slough of sights</HD>
<DH>Moss Landing is the jumping-off point for boat tours of a
wetland research reserve, with its wealth of marine life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Tannenbaum</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>Moss Landing, Calif.</DL>
<LD>The setting sun streaked the sky red above the sand dunes by the
harbor. It was Friday in this fishing village about 25 miles south of
Santa Cruz. Although warmed by dinner and wine from Phil's Fish
Market &amp; Eatery, we still needed sweatshirts in the crisp air of
dusk. Overhead, huge flocks of pelicans circled. They traveled in a
sweeping arc over Monterey Bay until, by some unspoken agreement,
they descended to low rock pilings where seemingly thousands had
already retired for the night.</LD>
<LD>   Fishing trawlers and gill-net boats were silhouetted in the
harbor, their engines still. Beyond lay the mouth of Elkhorn Slough,
a salt-marsh wetland that stretches across more than 4,000 acres and
supports almost 300 species of resident and migratory birds. About
1,440 of those acres constitute the Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine
Research Reserve, one of only 25 such reserves in the country.</LD>
<LD>   As we turned toward our car, my partner, Leah, took hold of my
arm. She said the only place she had seen as many birds was the
Galapagos. How, she asked, had I thought to come here?</LD>
<TE>   We have driven up and down the state innumerable times, stopping
at can't-miss places like the Santa Cruz boardwalk, the Monterey Bay
Aquarium and Hearst Castle and wondering about turnoffs along the
way. Moss Landing and Elkhorn Slough promised something out of the
ordinary: a funky seaside town and the opportunity to see wildlife in
the wetlands.</TE>
<TE>   Last month we flew into San Jose on a Friday morning, rented a car
and drove south, first down Highway 17, then Highway 1. We stopped
for lunch in Capitola at Gayle's, which has a nice retro ambience:
Formica tables and countertops, curtains made from vintage
tablecloths. We carried our order -- a spicy Texas barbecued chicken
sandwich, turkey on focaccia and fruit salad -- to the patio and
relaxed in the sun.</TE>
<TE>   Our next stop was neighboring Aptos and Sand Rock Farm, a B&amp;B run
by the mother-daughter team of Kris and Lynn Sheehan. Its Web site
had drawn our attention because it listed Lynn's credits as a chef,
including stints at the respected Bay Area restaurants Postrio,
Citron, Rubicon and Mecca.</TE>
<TE>   When we pulled into the gravel driveway of Sand Rock Farm, we
could not believe our good luck. Shaded by redwoods and live oaks,
the two-story, white-clapboard farmhouse was larger and more
picturesque than we expected: 10 acres of quiet gardens and woodland,
an inviting redwood deck and an enclosed wraparound porch.</TE>
<TE>   Kris recounted the history of the property while showing us
around. Dr. August Liliencrantz, an Oakland surgeon, built a small
cottage, barn and vineyard on 1,000 acres he purchased from his
friend Claus Spreckels, the sugar baron. Liliencrantz's son later
took over the property, built a larger farmhouse in 1910 and, with
Prohibition looming, shut down the wine operation and moved into
cattle ranching. By the time the Sheehans bought the farmhouse two
years ago, it had fallen into disrepair, requiring a year of
renovation.</TE>
<TE>   The results are impressive. Light streams through beveled glass
windows, authentic Roseville and Rookwood pottery sits atop the curly
redwood mantel, and a spinet piano graces the living room.</TE>
<TE>   The dining room table seats 18. It was a pleasure to wander the
home, admiring details like the Wedgewood stove in the kitchen and
the grandfather clock in a hallway.</TE>
<TE>   We stayed in a corner room upstairs called Eva's Garden, which
overlooks a rose garden. The room had a half-poster queen bed, a
gabled ceiling and a private bathroom with two-person Jacuzzi tub.</TE>
<TE>   It was hard to leave, but we were itching to see Moss Landing,
which awaited 15 minutes south. We caught the weekly 4 p.m. open
house at the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, a graduate school run
by the California State University system. A lecturer discussed
recent efforts to save leatherback turtles, and in the hallway we
found museum-quality displays about the Monterey Bay ecosystem.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, happy hour was in full swing at Charlie Moss's Restaurant,
where platters of calamari, pizza and fried clams covered a table.
Here we learned that the restaurant's namesake was a sea captain who
founded the town in 1853.</TE>
<TE>   The main drag, Moss Landing Road, curves past antique stores,
warehouses and brightly painted cafes, ending at Phil's Fish Market,
a favorite with locals. They took seats on the heated patio and
worked their way through huge platters of lobster and linguine. We
ordered Chardonnay, grilled ahi tuna, artichokes stuffed with
Dungeness crab and a Greek salad that arrived piled with bay shrimp
-- all simple, hearty and delicious.</TE>
<TE>   Breakfast the next morning at the B&amp;B was served family style in
the dining room. Kris served roasted rosemary potatoes and frittata
with broccoli, basil and sun-dried tomatoes. Two of the four other
couples at the table had driven from Long Beach to tour a winery. The
third couple came for a wedding, and the fourth simply wanted a
weekend away from the kids. The highlight of our day, we explained,
was to be a tour of Elkhorn Slough.</TE>
<TE>   The slough by pontoon</TE>
<TE>   Several companies offer tours of the wetlands by boat or kayak.
(Visit www.monterey-bay.net/ml for a listing.) I made reservations
with Elkhorn Slough Safari for a two-hour pontoon tour, $26 per
person. Owner Yohn Gideon piloted the boat as our naturalist, Heather
Edwards, described the habitat. She passed out counters so we could
track species for the Audubon Society and Moss Landing Marine
Laboratories.</TE>
<TE>   Elkhorn Slough, she explained, is 700 feet across at its widest
point. Eight feet of water sits atop 25 feet of mud deposits. Worms,
crabs, shrimp and clams thrive here, attracting the birds and mammals
that feed on them.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't long before we saw a sea otter and its pup dancing in
the water, their bodies entwined. Another otter appeared on its back
with a large mollusk on its chest and its paws clutching a stone --
the otter's clam opener.</TE>
<TE>   "Otters use tools," Heather said. "They might keep a special rock
for an hour, a week or a lifetime. They have pockets near their
underarms where they can store it when they swim."</TE>
<TE>   We were close enough to see the animal's whiskered face. Heather
explained that otters, unlike other marine mammals, don't have lots
of blubber. They seem so playful spinning around in the water, but
they're really working to stay warm.</TE>
<TE>   As we sailed up the slough, Yohn and Heather called out the
species of birds we passed. Grebes and marbled godwits fluttered in
the air. A long-billed curlew almost blended with the shoreline. A
peregrine falcon circled high above. By the time we returned, the
count included a cormorant, four great egrets, four snowy egrets, a
blue heron, nine otters and 59 harbor seals.</TE>
<TE>   Back in Moss Landing, Leah and I did some more counting: 20-plus
antique and collectible stores scattered around the harbor. Also
nearby: an interpretive center and hiking trails in the foothills
above the slough. For $5 per person, we parked there and had the
mountains to ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   The night ended at the Whole Enchilada, a bright, tropically
colored restaurant. The chicken tamales were so-so, but the cucumber
margaritas, baked mussels with cheese and garlic, and grilled salmon
with a delicious cilantro cream sauce more than made up for that.</TE>
<TE>   Even better was breakfast Sunday morning at Sand Rock Farm: baked
French toast that looked more like a brioche, served with
blueberry-infused syrup and covered with fresh peaches. It could have
been from the cover of Gourmet.</TE>
<TE>   As we drove back to the airport, heeding the rigid white lines of
the highway, what swam through our minds was the memory of sea
otters, twirling like children at play in the open water.</TE>

<AU>Kathleen Doheny</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A decade ago, U.S. airlines spent $6.11 per passenger for food. Last
year that figure was down to $4.17, according to the U.S. Department
of Transportation. And for the first six months of this year, they
spent $3.97 per passenger.</LD>
<LD>   The shrinking numbers don't tell the whole story, of course,
especially when you're the one flying across multiple states
fortified by a small bag of pretzels and a diet soda.</LD>
<LD>   To the rescue: A sometimes hilarious Web site, www.airline
meals.net, tells surfers at the click of a mouse what kind of haute
cuisine, or not, to expect on a range of airlines. Besides color
photos of the meals, there are candid, sometimes critical remarks and
reviews, and a forum for sharing gripes.</LD>
<TE>   If the meal meant for you looks unappetizing, you can put together
your own emergency kit of food. And, experts say, the choices in
portable food that won't spoil are becoming more plentiful.</TE>
<TE>   The airline meal Web site is the brainchild of Marco 't Hart, a
32-year-old graphic and Web designer from Rotterdam, Netherlands, who
launched it as a lark. For more than two years he flew from his home
to Istanbul, Turkey, to visit his girlfriend every two months or so.
"While in Turkey, I was always photographing everything to show the
people at home," he says. "Sometimes I also took pictures of my
meals. One time my mom asked, 'And what do you eat on the plane?'</TE>
<TE>   "That was my reason to take a picture of my meal, which is now
Turkish Airlines image #0010 on the site."</TE>
<TE>   Next he searched the Web to see whether anyone else had
photographed an airline meal for posterity and found about 20 photos
from eight or nine carriers, which he posted. Things really got
rolling earlier this year when he posted his request for photos of
airline meals in four or five online newsgroups.</TE>
<TE>   Since then the photos have poured in, and the Web site now boasts
more than 1,000 photos from airlines large and small. Although meals
are subject to change, the photos can give you a general idea of what
you'll be served. Suppose you are flying Aer Lingus, economy class,
from Dublin to Los Angeles. Click on Aer Lingus image 013 and take a
peek at lunch: chicken in mushroom gravy, potatoes, French beans. The
comment: "Tasted a bit better than it looks. Not much chicken."</TE>
<TE>   There's some whining, not surprisingly. A hungry passenger's
remark about the "dinner snack" on an ATA flight from Chicago to
D.C.: "I paid $264 for a ticket, and all they can afford is 15
peanuts and a cookie?"</TE>
<TE>   The site also has a forum for trading info about the food. One
Qantas flier asks, "Where has all the good food service gone? Qantas
now presents all meals in economy class in a box, and the food is
always boring."</TE>
<TE>   The top complaints, Hart says, are tasteless food, "undefinable"
meat, skimpy portions or food that is too hot or too cold. Some
passengers -- mostly first-class or business -- compliment. Some
mention presentation; others say the food was the best they ever had
on a plane.</TE>
<TE>   If you don't like what you see when you take a look at the Web
site or ask your reservations agent, it's easier than ever to pack
enough food for the trip.</TE>
<TE>   When travelers ask Terri Rock, a Santa Monica family practice
physician who has a special interest in travel medicine, what to
take, she often suggests the new tuna-in-a-pouch products. The
pouches don't need to be drained and don't require refrigeration
before opening. (The products are pungent, though, so you might
attract a little unwanted attention from fellow passengers.)</TE>
<TE>   PB Slices are another good option. This product, peanut butter
packaged like individual slices of cheese, is not yet available in
California, but it's expected to be within a few months, says a
spokeswoman for Kennedy Foods, which produces it. Each wrapped slice
has an ounce of peanut butter and 170 calories. For more information,
see www.pbslices.com.</TE>
<TE>   And take along some Tums, Rock suggests. They're a handy way to be
sure you get your calcium. If you eat strange food, they can quell a
queasy stomach too.</TE>
<TE>   She also suggests granola bars, beef sticks, Cheez Whiz and, if
you ask for bottled water, packets of dehydrated chicken soup and
oatmeal.</TE>
<TE>   Rock recommends that travelers in developing countries follow the
same precautions with food on the airplane that they do while dining
at their destination: They should not drink water unless they are
sure it is safe, and they should avoid salad greens that may have
been washed in contaminated water. After all, she reasons, the
airline and restaurants on the ground use the same food and drink
suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   Meal replacement bars have become common, says Evelyn Tribole, an
Irvine-based dietitian and author of "Eating on the Run" (1992, Human
Kinetics). The name is a bit of a misnomer, she says: "Many barely
have 280 calories," not enough to make a satisfying meal. But if you
choose to take along some of the bars, she advises looking for a
brand "with at least 10 grams of protein and 8 grams of fiber."</TE>
<TE>   This is easier said than done, as she knows. Promoted as a meal
bar, the apple-cinnamon variety of a product called Satisfaction,
made by Balance Bar, has 280 calories, 12 grams of protein and 6
grams of fiber. Slim-Fast also makes meal replacement bars; its milk
chocolate peanut bar has 220 calories and 8 grams of protein but just
2 grams of fiber.</TE>
<TE>   Consider packing some trail mix or a package of dried fruit,
Tribole suggests. "It's indestructible. If you sit on it, it's no big
deal."</TE>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Suburbia is still advancing rapidly from the floor of the Simi Valley
into the nearby hills, but there is some good news for hikers who
crave a wild landscape.</LD>
<LD>   The builder of the Long Canyon development has constructed the
ridge-top Canyon View Trail, which has intriguing sandstone
formations that look like western movie backdrops and have commanding
views of Simi Valley. The path traverses terrain belonging to the
Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District; the trail and others nearby
are maintained by the Rancho Simi Trail Blazers, whose volunteers
lead guided hikes. (Check www.rstb.homestead.com.)</LD>
<LD>   As you hike Canyon View Trail along the ridge, notice the
difference in vegetation between the slopes facing north and those
facing south. California buckwheat, Mexican elderberry, caterpillar
phacelia and laurel sumac grow on the shadier north slopes. Their
southern counterparts are dominated by non- native grasses, mustard,
thistle, and sage. Yucca and prickly pear cactus are scattered on the
trail.</LD>
<TE>   The rocks, however, may be the most picturesque part of the ridge.
Tan sandstone outcroppings tilted about 35 to 40 degrees lunge out of
the hilltops and are quite photogenic.</TE>
<TE>   To reach the trail head, follow U.S. 101 to Thousand Oaks. Take
Highway 23 north to Simi Valley and exit at Olsen Road, heading east.
Drive to Wood Ranch Parkway, turn right and continue until it
intersects with Long Canyon Road.</TE>
<TE>   Park in the dirt lot at the southwest corner of this intersection.
You'll see a signed trail head at the edge of the parking lot for
Long Canyon Trail, which leads south toward China Flat and Cheeseboro
Canyon. You'll want to join signed Canyon View Trail instead. Walk
east along the north side of Long Canyon Road a few hundred feet and
you'll reach the trail.</TE>

<HD>Changing policies mean smoking is still a hot topic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane Engle</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Smoking is a burning issue this fall in some major tourist spots.</LD>
<LD>   New York's mayor has vowed to snuff it out at the city's bars and
restaurants. Florida voters last week considered a wide-ranging ban.
Even in hang-loose Hawaii, some islands are starting to limit where
you light up.</LD>
<LD>   It might seem as if there's nowhere left to grab a cigarette.</LD>
<TE>   Well, not quite, but the options are dwindling.</TE>
<TE>   For travelers, whether they smoke or want to avoid those who do,
the challenge is to keep up with ever-changing policies. Here is a
snapshot of policies in various places and conveyances in the U.S.
The most definitive authority, of course, is your hotel or city, or
the cruise line, airport or train you're using.</TE>
<TE>   States and cities: California, in 1994, and Delaware, just this
May, approved statewide smoking bans in workplaces, including bars
and restaurants. As of the Travel section's deadline Tuesday, it
wasn't known whether Florida would become the third "nonsmoking"
state.</TE>
<TE>   In the rest of the country, the laws vary by county or city. As of
Oct. 16, more than 2,300 U.S. cities, counties and other local
governments restricted tobacco in some way, according to the American
Nonsmokers' Rights Foundation, a national lobbying group based in
Berkeley. More than 900 of them curbed smoking to some degree in
restaurants (112 banned it), 111 in free-standing bars (82 banned it)
and 1,101 in workplaces (172 banned it). For a list, visit
www.no-smoke.org.</TE>
<TE>   The New York City Council on Tuesday is expected to consider
whether to extend an earlier smoking ban (at office buildings and
restaurants seating more than 35) to all restaurants and bars,
including outdoor cafes.</TE>
<TE>   In Hawaii, restrictions at restaurants are in effect on Oahu,
including Honolulu, and are to begin Jan. 1 on Maui, Lanai and
Molokai. The Kauai County Council last month approved a similar
policy to start Jan. 1; the bill was awaiting action by the mayor at
the Travel section's deadline. The Big Island is also considering
restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Hotels: Hotels are generally setting aside fewer guest rooms for
smokers and more for nonsmokers than they once did, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   At Ritz-Carlton, 10% or fewer rooms chainwide, on average, allow
smoking, spokeswoman Stephanie Platt says, a decided decrease from
the past.</TE>
<TE>   From 1998 to 2001, the percentage of nonsmoking guest rooms
increased from 61% to 65% at U.S. hotels, according to a survey
prepared for the American Hotel &amp; Lodging Assn. You're more likely to
find nonsmoking rooms at an upscale hotel or a B&amp;B (both 72% of all
rooms) than at a budget hotel (46%). By contrast, hotels that get
lots of international visitors are more likely to accommodate
smokers, says Dennis Koci, senior vice president of operations
support for Hilton.</TE>
<TE>   Hilton maintains about three-fourths of its rooms as nonsmoking
and also offers "swing rooms" that can be used either way, he says.</TE>
<TE>   But "the problems we have putting a nonsmoker in a smoking room
are just unbelievable," he says. For some hoteliers, it's not worth
the hassle. Three years ago, Kimpton Group's Hotel Vintage Court in
San Francisco, which said about 95% of its guests asked for
nonsmoking rooms, went smoke-free.</TE>
<TE>   Public areas at hotels, such as restaurants and lobbies, typically
vary according to local laws.</TE>
<TE>   Airports and airplanes: Since 2000, all scheduled flights to and
from the U.S. have been required by federal law to be smoke-free; the
ban on domestic flights dates to 1990. Russia's Aeroflot was a
holdout, but in March it went smoke-free too.</TE>
<TE>   Some airports allow smoking in walled-off rooms, some in bars and
restaurants, some at airlines' first-class lounges, some only on
outdoor patios -- or a combination of these.</TE>
<TE>   LAX spokeswoman Nancy Castles says there are enclosed, ventilated
smoking rooms at the Tom Bradley, No. 2 and No. 7 terminals' "in
transit" lounges, where foreigners are confined between international
flights. "They technically haven't entered the country," she
explains. Otherwise smoking is allowed outside the terminals or on
two outdoor patios at Terminals 3 and 6.</TE>
<TE>   Unofficial lists of airport policies can be found at
www.pmoptions.com, www.smokingsection.com and www.no-smoke.org.</TE>
<TE>   Cruise ships: Most of the major lines active in the U.S. market
allow smoking in cabins and in designated public areas.</TE>
<TE>   A major exception is Carnival's Paradise, introduced in 1998,
which may be the world's only large cruise ship that is smoke-free.
It even bans possession of smoking materials. Violators can be booted
off the ship at the next port of call and fined $250. A couple of
people per month get caught, says spokeswoman Jennifer de la Cruz.</TE>
<TE>   On other Carnival ships, passengers can smoke in cabins and in
bars and open deck areas but not in dining rooms or show lounges, she
adds.</TE>
<TE>   Cunard's QE2 has smoking areas in its lounges, bars and dining
rooms, and even sets aside two public rooms for cigar smokers. "Many
more Europeans than Americans enjoy smoking," says spokeswoman Julie
Davis.</TE>
<TE>   But typical of a trend, Costa Cruises, which also has many
European customers and once had one of the more liberal smoking
policies, instituted a smoke-free policy for all its showrooms and
dining rooms in December 2001. Passengers wanted the change, says
spokesman Darren Oster.</TE>
<TE>   Trains: Smoking is generally banned on "non-overnight" Amtrak
trains, that is, shorter routes. Smoking is allowed on overnight
(long-distance) trains, with some exceptions, such as the entire
Coast Starlight, which runs between Los Angeles and Seattle, and the
Pennsylvanian, which runs between Chicago and Philadelphia, and parts
of some other routes. Where allowed, smoking is confined to a special
lounge car.</TE>
<TE>   This is my favorite Amtrak rule: You can't smoke in station
waiting rooms smaller than 1,100 square feet; you can in bigger
waiting rooms, in designated areas, unless local laws forbid it.</TE>
<TE>   Get out the tape measure -- and a law book.</TE>

<LD>The article "Savoring a Fine Old Port" (Oct. 20) caused tears to

<LD>   It was 1963, and I was on my way to France to teach at a school on
a U.S. Army base in La Rochelle. One lovely fall evening I took my
time driving along the picturesque harbor, through the clock tower
arch and on to a club. During the evening the music and the merriment
stopped when we were told that President John F. Kennedy had been
shot.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>While it is important to keep abreast of safety warnings issued by
the U.S. State Department ("Bali bombing proves the need to
understand safety warnings," Travel Insider, Oct. 27), the warnings
need to be weighed against other factors.</LD>
<LD>   According to many travel experts and trusted periodicals, Bali was
considered the safest place in Indonesia and one of the safest places
in Southeast Asia. Even with the travel advisory for Indonesia, I was
surprised that a terrorist attack occurred in Bali, because the idea
of an attack there seemed as remote a concept as an attack in Maui.</LD>
<LD>   Bali is close to many dangerous areas in Indonesia, and you
suggest that was another reason to defer travel to Bali. That is like
telling Americans to defer travel to Connecticut or New Jersey
because of their proximity to Manhattan.</LD>
<TE>   Many warnings are issued to encourage Americans to remain vigilant
everywhere, including in the U.S. If another terrorist attack were to
occur in the U.S., it would not be fair to imply that the victims
were at fault for having failed to remain vigilant.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I read "High Price of RV Trips" (Letters, Oct. 27) with amusement. A
worthwhile RV can be found for $50,000, and well-equipped units (with
air conditioner, microwave, TV) start in the $60,000s. Prices go up
from there depending on how luxuriously one wishes to travel.</LD>
<LD>   An RV is hardly economical. It is, rather, a way of being able to
experience a campfire in a rustic setting and have the luxury of your
own comfy mini-condo. Of course, an RVer also can "camp" at a posh
full-service resort.</LD>

<LD>Thank you for your article "In Montreal, Dining on Char and Caribou"
(Sept. 8). Our vacation to Niagara Falls, southeast Canada and Maine
included a stop in Montreal, and, after reading about the enticing
restaurants you covered, we decided to try Toque.</LD>
<LD>   It was one of the highlights of our trip. The exquisite dinner
affirmed why Normand Laprise has been called Montreal's most creative
chef. His penchant for quality and freshness and his use of
indigenous foods were present in the best ways.</LD>
<LD>   We met him in his bustling kitchen, where he graciously chatted
and autographed your article. He wrote "Thank you very much" -- in
Japanese.</LD>

<LD>English palaces, Tower offer tickets online</LD>
<LD>   Tickets to three of England's most popular royal sites can be
reserved online or by phone before crossing the pond.</LD>
<LD>   Until last month, tourists had to visit the Tower of London,
Hampton Court Palace or Kensington Palace or certain train or subway
stations to buy tickets for that day or in advance, said Lisa Brock,
spokeswoman for Historic Royal Palaces, which operates the sites.
During peak times, the lines can be long. With tickets, visitors can
go to the gate.</LD>
<TE>   Tickets are nonrefundable, and there's a shipping charge of about
$4.60 per order.</TE>
<TE>   The Internet site for tickets is www.hrp.org.uk. The ticket phones
are 011-44-870-756-7070 for the Tower of London, 011-44-870-753-7777
for Hampton Court Palace and 011-44-870-751-5180 for Kensington
Palace. Phones are staffed from 1 a.m. to 1 p.m. weekdays and 2 to 9
a.m. weekends, Pacific time.</TE>
<TE>   Caution urged for Americans in Southeast Asia</TE>
<TE>   The State Department on Nov. 2 issued a public announcement "to
remind Americans of the potential for terrorist actions against U.S.
citizens abroad, specifically in the Southeast Asia region."</TE>
<TE>   The announcement followed the Oct. 12 bombings in Bali,
Indonesia's best-known resort island. The blasts, thought to be the
work of terrorists, tore through nightclubs crowded with foreigners,
killing and injuring scores of tourists.</TE>
<TE>   The department continued to warn against travel to Indonesia. It
stopped short of such a warning for Southeast Asia as a whole.
Instead it urged Americans to "remain vigilant" in the region and
noted that terrorists are seeking "softer" targets such as clubs,
hotels and resorts.</TE>
<TE>   Artists open their doors to visitors in Santa Barbara</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-six artists in the Santa Barbara area will open their
studios to visitors next weekend in the first of what organizers hope
will be an annual event. Admission is free.</TE>
<TE>   The event is sponsored by Santa Barbara Studio Artists, a
year-old, private nonprofit association of about 50 professional
painters and sculptors.</TE>
<TE>   The studios, open 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Nov. 16 and 17, range from
Montecito to Solvang. They usually are open by appointment only, said
Dorothy Churchill-Johnson of Santa Barbara, an oil painter on the
association's board.</TE>
<TE>   Brochures for "Open Studios Weekend," with maps, will be available
in Santa Barbara at the visitor center on Cabrillo Boulevard and
other sites. For information, call the association at (805) 898-4471.</TE>
<TE>   Traveler's notes</TE>
<TE>   In September, major U.S. airlines posted their best on-time
performance since the U.S. Department of Transportation began keeping
records in 1995, and the lowest rate of mishandled baggage since
records began in 1987.... On Monday Delta will expand a program that
lets some passengers pay $50 to $150 (depending on mileage) for
standby first-class upgrades. It will be offered on selected off-peak
flights within the U.S. and to San Juan, Puerto Rico, and St. Thomas
in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Customers flying on "deeply discounted
and 'sale' fares are excluded," Delta said.</TE>
<TE>   DEAL OF THE WEEK</TE>
<TE>   Taking a spin through Spain</TE>

<KH>Destination: Argentina</KH>
<HD>Tasting the good life in Mendoza</HD>
<DH>On a tour through the country's main wine region, expect
superb vintages, unbelievable values and the familial intimacy of
small vineyards.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andrew Bakalar</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>Mendoza, Argentina</DL>
<LD>My Argentine friend, Carolina Fuller, and I took a detour down a dirt
road. A whitewashed warehouse with a tangerine-colored roof rose
above rows of leafy vines. In front of massive wood doors stood
Federico Cassone, owner and winemaker at Finca la Florencia's winery.
Behind him wine, crackers and cheese were laid out on a rustic wood
table.</LD>
<LD>   After hearing of my enthusiasm for his family's wine, his father,
Eduardo, led me to an adjacent gallery of oak casks and withdrew wine
from one.</LD>
<LD>   Federico's mother provided a glass. Eduardo filled it and urged me
to try a Gran Reserve Malbec 2000. I took a sip. Pondered. Then
reached for my wallet, offering him all the cash I had. Everyone
laughed.</LD>
<TE>   It felt as if I were in the home of old friends.</TE>
<TE>   I found the warm intimacy of my tasting experience at Finca la
Florencia over and over again on my trip last January to the Mendoza
wine country, spread before the foothills of the Andes, about 350
miles northwest of Buenos Aires. I sipped wine with vineyard owners,
took tours led by winemakers and tasted some startlingly fine wines
for rock-bottom prices. The region is only now gearing up for
tourists, and therein lies its charm. Tours and tastings here tend to
be informal and personal, often led by the winemakers themselves.
Bistros and winery gift shops are just starting to pop up.</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza produces three-quarters of Argentina's wine, and until
recently most of it was consumed domestically. Argentina's per capita
wine consumption is third in the world, behind Italy and France; the
country is fifth in wine production.</TE>
<TE>   Summer days here are hot and humid, and winters are cool, making
the region ideal for growing wine grapes, especially the intense
malbec, Mendoza's signature varietal. This black grape, brought from
France decades ago, was considered second-rate there, but Argentines
have cultivated it to a level unequaled by the French. On Wine
Spectator magazine's 100-point scale, 24 Argentine bottlings are
ranked 90 or above.</TE>
<TE>   But it's not only the quality that makes Argentine wines so
attractive. It's also their low price, and that's due partly to
Argentina's economic crisis and the recent devaluation of its peso.</TE>
<TE>   After I planned my trip, my third vacation there in eight years,
Argentina's economy tumbled, and riots broke out in some cities. But
Argentine friends assured me Mendoza was calm and safe, so last
December I flew from Los Angeles into Santiago, Chile, about 200
miles west of Mendoza and closer than the capital of Buenos Aires. I
then took a 45-minute flight over the Andes to Mendoza.</TE>
<TE>   On the advice of those same friends, I bypassed the city of
Mendoza in favor of a spa hotel tucked into the mountains to the
south. I followed Route 7 out of the city, weaving across flatlands
that reminded me of southern France. After 18 miles, the road led
into a mountain pass and the Hotel Termas de Cacheuta. It was out of
the way for winery visits, but for peace and relaxation it had no
equal. My double room cost 96 pesos per person -- now about $27 --
including meals and access to the hotel's spa complex, with its
stone-grotto sauna, volcanic mud baths, hydro-massage, thermal pools
and professional masseurs.</TE>
<TE>   On my first morning I prepared for four days of winery visits.
Most of the local wineries, or bodegas, are clustered around two
suburbs of Mendoza: Maipu, about eight miles southeast of downtown,
and Lujan, about 10 miles south.</TE>
<TE>   One can visit wineries on bus tours, which generally stop at
vineyards along the "wine route," devised by wineries and the local
government to guide visitors through the area's 100-plus bodegas.
Another option is to hire an English-speaking guide. But I preferred
to tour in a rented car at my own pace.</TE>
<TE>   I relied on the suggestions of guidebooks and locals to choose the
wineries I would visit. Of the 16 I saw, 10 were suggestions from
locals and only two were disappointments.</TE>
<TE>   First on my list was Fabre Montmayou, a medium-size establishment
purchased eight years ago by French winemakers. Soledad Guevara,
Fabre's English-speaking tour guide, led me through the facility, a
handsome redbrick and terra-cotta structure. We ended at the tasting
bar, which is in the warehouse amid crates and bottling machines.</TE>
<TE>   Fabre makes an excellent, earthy 1999 Malbec, although I preferred
its 2000 Chardonnay, among the best whites I had in Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   Next was Bodegas Leoncio Arizu, a family-owned winery a mile north
of Lujan's main plaza; its wines are marketed under the name Luigi
Bosca. One of the owners, Gustavo Arizu, who spoke fluent English,
led me on a tour, ending at a third-floor tasting room in a majestic
tower, where I sampled the '99 Malbec -- for me, the winery's finest.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward I drove to the nearby Bodegas Nieto Senetiner. I'd read
about its home-cooked lunch after the 12:30 p.m. tour, and I didn't
want to miss it. A table had been set under a sagging tree, with a
heartwarming view of the vineyards and snowcapped mountains. Behind
me, gardens and Spanish colonial-style buildings completed the
picture. Marcela Bartolini, who oversees the facility, joined me for
lunch.</TE>
<TE>   The cook told me the delicious meat empanadas were made from
scratch. The brisket-like asado, pork blood sausages and caramel ice
cream had all been prepared that morning.</TE>
<TE>   Nieto is owned by one of Argentina's wealthiest families, the
Perez Compancs, who purchased the winery four years ago. The 1999
Syrah I had with my lunch was as breathtaking as the view.</TE>
<TE>   Most vineyard tours end at 4 or 5 p.m., so I had time for one stop
after lunch. I drove four miles south of Lujan to Norton, one of
Argentina's best-known vintners. A rococo-style staircase at the
entrance led to a second-floor tasting room with commanding views of
the Andes. But the wines failed to live up to their reputation, as
did the reception. No owner or winemaker here. Norton was one of the
few disappointments of my trip.</TE>
<TE>   Next morning, I drove through Lujan to two tiny wineries that
Marcela had recommended. Viniterra was conveniently located on Route
40, the national highway linking Mendoza to San Rafael to the south.
It is owned by the Senetiner family, who set up shop across town
after selling the winery still bearing their name. In the tasting
room I found Flavio Senetiner, who went over his wines for me. His
family brings more than 80 years of experience to their new
operation, and it shows: His selection was the best I found. The
Chardonnay/Semillon, Viognier and Pinot Grigio whites were dry and
sophisticated. The reds -- Malbec, Merlot, Cabernet/Syrah -- were all
smooth and full-bodied.</TE>
<TE>   Curiosity drove me to my last stop for the day, Bodegas Lopez, one
of Mendoza's major wineries; I had seen its handsome Spanish-style
palazzo in the tourist office's brochure. In its tasting room, as
elegant as many in Napa or Sonoma, I was greeted by one of the
owners, Eduardo Lopez. So few Americans had been visiting the winery
last winter that when he heard I was there, he instructed his staff
to bring out all the wines -- I liked his Montchenot, a blend of
malbec, cabernet sauvignon and merlot -- and he sat down with me to
talk about each one. I later learned that the Lopez family's
hospitality is legendary in Mendoza.</TE>
<TE>   By this time I'd had more wine than I usually consume in a month,
and I needed a break. Mendoza's other major attraction is adventure
tourism, so I spent the afternoon rafting on the Mendoza River and
enjoying the spa at my hotel. By evening I felt pampered and
cleansed.</TE>
<TE>   Architectural standouts</TE>
<TE>   The next morning I was off to Maipu and La Rural, a combination
winery and museum on the grounds of a turn-of-the-century ranch. The
museum was mostly a scrappy room filled with wine-related antiques,
but I was more impressed by the dozen massive French oak barrels
flanking a corridor that led to the tasting room.</TE>
<TE>   I skipped the 45-minute tour and went right for the wines. Glasses
of La Rural's economical San Felipe line were free (with the tour),
but I found them too sweet. (La Rural was the only winery that
charged for tasting.) For a few dollars more I tried the more refined
Familia Rutini line. Even at 30 pesos (now $8.50) a bottle, the '98
Merlot was hardly worth making room in my suitcase for.</TE>
<TE>   I finished the afternoon at the region's most renowned winery,
built in 1884. Escorihuela is on every bus tour and is conveniently
located a mile and a half south of downtown Mendoza. It houses one of
the city's finest restaurants and a small art gallery.</TE>
<TE>   Winemaker Estela Perinetti was on hand in the tasting room, as was
a display of Carcassonne Clasico, a less expensive line I tried at
the Hotel Termas, and Escorihuela Gascon, a premium line sold in the
U.S. Estela initially poured a 1997 Gascon, a blend of malbec,
cabernet sauvignon and merlot. Noting my less-than-enthusiastic
smile, she brought out a wine she created: Escorihuela Gascon Reserve
2000, a limited-edition blend of malbec, cabernet sauvignon and
merlot. That one won a space in my suitcase.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward I walked across the winery's courtyard to Escorihuela's
restaurant, 1884. Smart and hip in decor, the place is usually packed
but was empty when I was there. My meal of corn tamales, salad,
banana chocolate parfait and wine was excellent, elegantly presented
and cost only 30 pesos.</TE>
<TE>   That evening I drove more than an hour south of Mendoza to a
winery with a lodge that Eduardo Lopez had recommended for its
spectacular setting and architecture. Bodegas Salentein has a comfy
ranch-style posada, where I stayed my final night in Mendoza
Province. I drove up a dirt road to find a rustic four-room ranch
house and an adjacent casita that sleeps six in groves of trees. Two
Argentines, an Englishman and a Swede were having dinner as I walked
in, and they invited me to join them. Soon I was dining on beef
empanadas, followed by beef tenderloin in a refined mushroom wine
sauce, accompanied by Salentein wines.</TE>
<TE>   About 10 the next morning I arrived at the Salentein winery, a
cross-shaped brick warehouse nestled in the shadow of the Andes. In
its enormous interior, about 2,000 bottles in metal containers
surround a columned sanctuary whose casks encircle a mosaic star.
Light from an open arcade provides church-like illumination from
above. It felt ancient and holy, like a Roman temple.</TE>
<TE>   With a visitor center, wine bar and gift shop nearing completion,
the winery is positioning itself to be a major tourist attraction.
The only disappointment was the wines. None was as memorable as
Salentein's posada.</TE>
<TE>   Later I drove north to the area's other architectural marvel,
Catena Zapata, a majestic yellow Mayan temple set in a sea of
vineyards only 20 minutes south of Lujan. Catena's interior is as
eye-catching as its exterior. Gilded staircases crisscross toward a
glass dome. Below, lacquered doors lead to sleek tasting rooms, the
most dramatic of which holds a panoramic window that looks onto rows
of casks illuminated from above.</TE>
<TE>   The wines reflect the family's 100 years of experience. Wine
expert Robert Parker gives Catena Zapata's 1999 Chardonnay a 93 on
his 100-point scale. And the winery's 2000 Chardonnay was indeed
rich, aromatic and smooth. The 2001 Malbec, used mostly in blends,
was the stuff of dreams. But I couldn't purchase any bottles because
Catena Zapata exports all of its production.</TE>
<TE>   At Carolina's urging, I hit one more winery before catching the
plane back to Chile: Chandon, a division of the French champagne
company.</TE>
<TE>   Having been to the Chandon winery in Napa Valley, I was skeptical
about its quality. But Chandon Argentina's winemaker, Manuel Louzada,
is a man at the top of his game. I couldn't resist asking for more of
the Cuvee Reserve. Even more dazzling was the Baron B. Rose,
containing 5% malbec. Two bottles of this gem took up the remaining
room in my suitcase.</TE>
<TE>   Months after my return home, I ordered four more bottles shipped
to Los Angeles for the wedding of a close friend. After one sip, my
friends clamored to find out how they could get a case. At $6 a
bottle, they knew it was a steal.</TE>

<LD>Schussers and snowboarders can come in from the cold this season at
several new places in Western ski resorts. Among them:</LD>
<LD>   Marriott's Timber Lodge and Marriott's Grand Residence Club in
South Lake Tahoe, Calif., both near the gondola that takes skiers to
Heavenly Ski Resort. The Timber Lodge is a traditional time- share,
and the Residence Club offers "fractional ownership," but both of the
recently opened accommodations also offer single-night lodgings.</LD>
<LD>   The lodge, when completed, will have 261 units (131 will open
initially), and the club, 199. Through Dec. 14, rates for
by-the-night bookings begin at $79 midweek and $99 on weekends. The
resorts offer a health club and heated pool.</LD>
<TE>   For information, call (800) 845-5279, www.mvcirentals.com.</TE>
<TE>   Heavenly Ski Resort is now owned by Vail Resorts, which plans $40
million in improvements in the next five years. The season begins
Nov. 22. For information on ski conditions: (775) 586-7000,
www.skiheavenly.com.</TE>
<TE>   A Ritz-Carlton hotel in Bachelor Gulch, part of the Beaver Creek
Mountain ski area about 20 miles from Vail, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   The 237-room hotel, which takes its architectural inspiration from
several western national park inns, is scheduled to open Nov. 21.</TE>
<TE>   The resort has a 21,000-square-foot spa and is about 10 miles from
two golf courses -- one already open and the other set to open in
2003. For animal lovers, the resort also will have a resident dog, a
yellow Lab named -- surprise -- Bachelor.</TE>
<TE>   Introductory room rates through Dec. 12 begin at $175. For
reservations or information: (800) 576-5582, www.ritzcarlton.com.</TE>
<TE>   Connected by tunnel to the hotel is the Ritz-Carlton Club, which
offers fractional ownership in its 54 two- and three-bedroom
residences. It is scheduled to be completed in December. Prices begin
at $180,000, which entitles the owner to 21 days per year. For
information: (800) 278-0121, www.ritzcarltonclub.com.</TE>
<TE>   Beaver Creek Mountain is scheduled to open Nov. 23. The resort
reported receiving about 23 inches of new snow as of last week and
was making more. For information on ski conditions: (800) 404-3535,
www.beavercreek.com.</TE>
<TE>   Two condominium projects at Mammoth, set to open in February.</TE>
<TE>   The 77-unit Lincoln House and the 89-unit White Mountain Lodge are
part of a nearly billion-dollar upgrade by giant Intrawest Corp.
designed to turn Mammoth into the next Aspen, with new retail shops,
bars and restaurants at the base of a new 15-passenger gondola. The
gondola's debut has been delayed because key parts were caught in the
West Coast shipping snarl, officials say. No new date has been set.</TE>
<TE>   Rates at the condos will begin at $310 a night. For information:
(800) 626-6684, www.intrawestmammoth.com.</TE>
<TE>   Mammoth Mountain was to have opened Thursday. For information on
ski conditions: (888) 766-9778, www.mammothmountain.com.</TE>

<HD>Bumpy road of a novice RVer</HD>
<DH>A first-timer hits the highway in a motor home, a trend
that's accelerated since Sept. 11, and finds rewards and rough spots
traveling in a 'mini-condo on wheels.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rosemary McClure</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>Mojave National Preserve, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Our rented motor home shimmied and shook as we began the long climb
up the Cajon Pass to the high desert. Traffic hurtled by to our left.
We hugged the slow lane, crossed our fingers and talked about other
near-death experiences.</LD>
<LD>   "Going uphill is definitely not a strong point," I said as a semi
blasted by and the RV shuddered. Actually, I didn't say it; I yelled
it. So many things were rattling inside the vehicle -- the
mini-blinds, the stove, the microwave -- that we couldn't hear one
another without shouting.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a much harsher ride than I expected," Ted hollered back.
"Your body takes a beating. And we look like a traveling billboard,"
he said, referring to the 2-foot-high Cruise America advertisements
scrawled across the sides of the motor home.</LD>
<TE>   "I guess there's not much chance people will think we're old hands
at this," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "Not the way you're driving," Dorothy said, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   Laughter is a good thing, I thought to myself, and I hoped we
would keep on laughing.</TE>
<TE>   We did. Through the engine that wouldn't start, the heater that
wouldn't work and the ladder that fell and almost beaned Dorothy. We
even kept on laughing -- well, almost -- when the toilet waste tank
splashed on us.</TE>
<TE>   Several days later, when I told Cruise America executive Bob
Calderone about our journey, he gave me some after-the-fact advice:
"You need to take along a sense of humor the first time you rent."</TE>
<TE>   I had to admit I'd never given much thought to the problems a
novice RVer might encounter when I invited Ted Panzer and Dorothy
DesLauriers, who are veteran tent campers, to join me on a long
weekend in the desert. The plan was to rent a motor home and see why
RV travel has become a star of the travel industry. When other modes
of travel faltered after Sept. 11, motor home sales and rentals
surged. Families, especially boomers, piled into RVs in record
numbers last summer, according to travel industry statistics.</TE>
<TE>   And there had to be a first time for all of them.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to make our vehicles as bulletproof as possible,"
Calderone said. "But it's a very complex system. It's an apartment on
wheels."</TE>
<TE>   I thought we might be in trouble when Ted and I went to the Galaxy
Campers lot in Ontario to pick up our mini motor home. Surrounded by
camper shells and RVs, Cruise America rental agent Karen Lovejoy
introduced us to our 25-foot cab-over rig. She used words that
usually put me to sleep: valves, switches, shorelines, hookups,
holding tanks, waste tanks, generators, propane tanks, receptacles.
Only now I wasn't asleep; I was panicking.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have the slightest idea what you're talking about," I
blurted. "Relax," she said, pointing to Ted. "He knows what I'm
talking about."</TE>
<TE>   "Do you understand this?" I asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure," he answered confidently.</TE>
<TE>   Our orientation lecture lasted about an hour. When it was done, I
was more confused than ever.</TE>
<TE>   "Just get in and drive," Lovejoy said. "Don't worry. You'll have a
great time."</TE>
<TE>   I crawled up into the driver's seat and checked my rearview
mirror, but all it reflected was the inside of the RV.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't see anything," I said, my voice rising as I rolled down
the window to talk to her.</TE>
<TE>   "Relax," she said again. "You have mirrors on both sides; use them
instead of the rearview mirror."</TE>
<TE>   I waited for Ted to pull ahead of me in his car, then eased into
drive and bumped out of the RV lot. Five miles of stop signs and
lights en route to Ted and Dorothy's house helped loosen me up.</TE>
<TE>   My high-profile vehicle brushed overhanging tree limbs only a
couple of times.</TE>
<TE>   Ted and I loaded the motor home. We took a good look around the
inside as we brought aboard food, blankets, utensils and other
supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Our rig, built on a Ford truck chassis, was a masterpiece of
compact storage. It had 16 cupboards of varying sizes, a double bed,
a dining alcove, sink, refrigerator, stove, easy chair, microwave and
bathroom. The bathroom wasn't much to speak of: The toilet stall was
only 18 inches wide. There was also a tiny shower.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the double bed, there was a cab-over bunk above the
driving compartment, and the dining alcove converted into a bed. The
double bed was standard size, but the two other beds were fit for
kids or Lilliputians. The cab-over had only 18 inches of clearance
between the bed and the ceiling -- a headache in the making if you
awoke with a start. The dining alcove bed, where I slept, was only 5
feet, 6 inches long. Unfortunately, I'm 5 feet 8.</TE>
<TE>   We picked up Dorothy at work and pulled into a gas station. We
pulled out $50 later. It was the first of four gas stops we made as
we prowled the desert, putting 633 miles on our rental and spending
$143.55 on gas.</TE>
<TE>   I rented from Cruise America because of availability and
convenience. Like the other major player in the U.S. industry, El
Monte RV, Cruise America has a three-day minimum. During fall, both
offer special deals. Our motor home, for instance, cost $457.61 for
three days and three days free.</TE>
<TE>   One inconvenience: Both agencies have a small window for picking
up and dropping off vehicles. For a weekend rental, for instance, you
must pick up a Cruise America vehicle between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.
Friday and drop it off between 9 and 11 a.m. Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Transported to another world</TE>
<TE>   We topped Cajon Summit as the sun was setting. We were growing
hungry, but with thousands of other weekend travelers on the road, we
didn't want to waste time stopping.</TE>
<TE>   "This is why we have a motor home," Ted said, as he peered into a
cupboard in search of snacks. He reappeared with a savory wheel of
Gouda and crackers.</TE>
<TE>   "We may have gotten off to a rocky start, but there must be lots
of other good reasons to vacation like this," I said. "Seven million
RV owners can't be wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Ted answered quickly. "No matter how cold the weather is, you're
protected," he said, recalling a night camping in the desert when the
temperature dropped to 17 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter how bad the wind is, you're not out in it," Dorothy
said, recalling a storm last Thanksgiving that played havoc with
their tent. "I think if you had kids or pets or elderly people along,
it would offer a lot of other advantages too."</TE>
<TE>   About an hour later, we added another plus to our list when we
arrived at Mojave National Preserve, our destination. This isolated
1.6-million-acre chunk of desert is so vast that it is one of the
largest units in the National Park System, but there are no
accommodations in the park. The closest lodging is a four-room
bed-and-breakfast in Nipton, near the north end of the preserve.</TE>
<TE>   There are two fine family campgrounds, one in a pockmarked
volcanic region called Hole-in-the-Wall and the other set amid
junipers and pinyon pines in a region called Mid-Hills. Both are
first come, first served. We eased the RV over the washboard road
leading to Hole-in-the-Wall and kept our fingers crossed that there
would be empty campsites.</TE>
<TE>   "Eleven's open," Ted yelled.</TE>
<TE>   "Fourteen looks good," Dorothy said.</TE>
<TE>   We circled the campground and found several sites open. Our choice
was one close to a toilet -- a pit toilet.</TE>
<TE>   Why, one might ask, did we care about pit toilets when we had our
own toilet on board?</TE>
<TE>   Because our sewer hookup and sewage disposal lesson had been so
intimidating we decided we would rather use a pit toilet than have to
dump the storage tank.</TE>
<TE>   OK, so we're wusses.</TE>
<TE>   With Ted's help, I backed the RV into a campsite, and we settled
in. Ted paid the $12-per-night camping fee, then stacked kindling and
wood in our site's fire ring and lighted it. We broke out some wine,
relaxed in camp chairs and remembered why we had wanted to come.
Above us was a full moon in a clear sky. We could see the stark
outline of volcanic mountains in the distance, and we could hear the
crackling fire and the far-off wail of a coyote. It was a six-hour
drive from our homes but a world apart.</TE>
<TE>   We talked for a couple of hours, enjoying the stillness of the
43-degree night air.</TE>
<TE>   "Much as I love being out here right now, I'm glad I'm not
sleeping in a tent," I said.</TE>
<TE>   Getting past the glitches</TE>
<TE>   I would have been happier had my bed been a couple of inches
longer. I also would have been happier if we had tested the motor
home heater to make sure it worked -- and that we knew how to use it
-- before leaving Galaxy Campers. The temperature dropped to 35
degrees around 4 a.m. I shivered in my bed and hoped daylight would
arrive quickly.</TE>
<TE>   We awoke at 7:15 a.m. to the sound of gunfire echoing off the
surrounding mountains. It was deer hunting season, and it seemed that
everyone else in the campground was already out stalking bucks.</TE>
<TE>   I said a silent prayer for the deer.</TE>
<TE>   Dorothy wanted to fix some coffee and asked how to start the
stove. I looked at Ted. He didn't answer.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought you said you understood when Karen gave us the
orientation."</TE>
<TE>   "I did understand," he said. "I just don't remember."</TE>
<TE>   Dorothy fiddled with things for a while, then got out the 117-page
Cruise America manual. She had coffee brewing in a matter of minutes.
We sat outside at our picnic table and planned our day.</TE>
<TE>   Mojave National Preserve is a relatively new park, established in
1994 through the California Desert Protection Act. It is home to
rose-colored sand dunes, limestone caverns, volcanic cinder cones,
Joshua tree forests and nine mountain ranges topping out at nearly
9,000 feet. There is a variety of wildlife, from desert tortoises to
bighorn sheep and mule deer.</TE>
<TE>   There are about 2,000 miles of road -- much of it unpaved --
within the park. We planned a route that would take us through the
center of the preserve to its northeastern edge and down to the
southwestern edge. We knew it would be a long day.</TE>
<TE>   "So what should we leave in the campsite and what should we take?"
Dorothy asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Score another plus for the RV," Ted said. "We don't have to leave
anything. We can take it all with us."</TE>
<TE>   I wasn't sure that was a plus, because it meant packing and
unpacking. But at least we wouldn't have to worry about anything
being stolen while we were gone.</TE>
<TE>   We marked the campsite so no one else would take it and headed out
across the desert, Ted at the wheel. The park roads weren't as good
as the major highways we had taken to get here, and the clatter,
rattle and bounce of our vehicle seemed to increase tenfold.</TE>
<TE>   The age of our RV probably had something to do with the rough
ride. Our 2000-model rental had more than 60,000 miles on it. The
driver's seat back was broken, the armrest was missing, the dinette
table was cracked and we had trouble starting the engine a few times.</TE>
<TE>   Seal Beach residents Brian and Rosie Brown had a similar
experience when they rented the first time. Their 32-foot El Monte RV
rental "was old and falling apart," Brian said. "A door fell off in
our daughter's hand, and she's only 4. It went 35 mph uphill; going
downhill was worse because the brakes seemed so shaky."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the Browns said they had a terrific family vacation
visiting the Grand Canyon, Bryce and Zion in Utah and other Western
parks. "It was a great way to vacation with small kids," Brian said.
"We could stop when we wanted and move on when we wanted. And we
didn't have to lose a couple of hours every time we wanted to eat."</TE>
<TE>   So the Browns took the plunge. They just spent more than $100,000
on a used motor home.</TE>
<TE>   A day in the desert</TE>
<TE>   We stopped at the tiny town of Nipton, near the boundary of the
park, to have lunch. The 1910 Hotel Nipton, the closest lodging to
the park, is a step back in time. Four charming bedrooms lead off a
parlor that has exposed beams, a wood-burning stove and
Southwest-style furniture. The price is right: $69.50 a night. The
downsides: shared bathrooms and a location next to a frequently used
rail line.</TE>
<TE>   Neither deterred Andralee Drescher, a Laughlin, Nev., resident who
was staying at the hotel for the first time when we visited. "We made
the reservations on a fluke. We were so happy when we got here and
saw it that we were giddy. It's a wonderful little place."</TE>
<TE>   We piled back into our rig and realized we needed gas again. The
RV averaged 9 miles a gallon, so we had to tank up frequently. A
34-mile trip southwest on Interstate 15 took us to the nearest
station, at Halloran Summit, where we paid $2.50 per gallon and met
Boxer the rockhound. Actually, Boxer is an 8-year-old Great
Dane-German shepherd mix that greets customers and chases -- and
catches -- rocks at Hilltop Mart and Gas Station.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone should buy that dog a Frisbee," Dorothy said, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   "Or invite him to be on Letterman's stupid pet tricks," I said.</TE>
<TE>   We turned back into the park and drove south on scenic Cima Road,
where thick stands of Joshua trees and rugged outcroppings of jumble
rocks lured us into frequent stops to explore and shoot pictures.
That made us late arriving at Kelso Dunes, a 45-mile-long sea of
softly carved sand mountains that rise as much as 600 feet above the
desert floor. A hike to the summit is about three miles, but with
sunset beginning to tinge the sky, we decided we couldn't make it.</TE>
<TE>   Back at our campsite, we grilled steaks, drank more wine and
counted constellations. Then I shivered again in my bed and wished,
one more time, that I was shorter or the bed was longer.</TE>
<TE>   What a dump</TE>
<TE>   On our final day we drove to Mitchell Caverns, a state park within
the preserve. Rangers lead tours -- for $3 per person -- through a
lighted cave system that features limestone stalactites and
stalagmites. The tour is fun, and the 65-degree temperature inside
the cave was a nice break from the 85-degree heat outside.</TE>
<TE>   We were hiking back to the ranger station along a 2-foot-wide
trail about 500 feet above the desert floor when I caught a bit of
movement out of the corner of my eye. A Mojave speckled rattlesnake
was heading toward me. I screamed and backed away. The snake blithely
crossed the trail and slithered down the hillside.</TE>
<TE>   We retreated to the RV, had lunch and headed for home.</TE>
<TE>   The next day I called Galaxy Campers to double-check on turn-in
times. Lovejoy wasn't there, and I talked to Shirley Yavelak, who
said she was the owner of Galaxy Campers. I mentioned that we
wouldn't be dumping the toilet waste tank because we hadn't used it.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, you will," she said. "Or you'll pay a $100 fee for returning
the RV without cleaning out the tank."</TE>
<TE>   I called my friends and relayed the bad news.</TE>
<TE>   Ted and I drove to a waste disposal station near the Galaxy lot.
We expected the worst.</TE>
<TE>   At least we weren't surprised.</TE>
<TE>   Despite our best efforts -- and careful reading of the Cruise
America handbook -- raw sewage splattered us when Ted removed the
sewer outlet valve cover. The stench was unmistakable.</TE>
<TE>   Lovejoy later apologized and said she wouldn't charge us the $100
fee. "The last person who used it obviously didn't dump correctly,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   It's a good thing we'd packed our sense of humor.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: Five hundred three steps. Or is it 505? By the time
you've climbed to the top of Torre del Mangia, the bell tower that
rises 330 feet above Siena, Italy, it's easy to lose count. In April,
Huntington Beach reader Jason Van Auker huffed up the 1348 tower to
get his "Best Shot" while girlfriend Tori Armstrong waited in the
Piazza del Campo below. Van Auker reports it's a long haul -- so long
that there's a restroom midway.</CP>

<KH>HER WORLD</KH>
<HD>Though she lives in Van Nuys, her heart is in the Himalayas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Spano</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joyce Tapper has an affair of the heart with Nepal. She loves many
things about the country, including the way people greet each other
in the street by touching their palms together and saying namaste.</LD>
<LD>   "It means 'the god in me reflects the god in you,' " Tapper says.
"In Katmandu, people 'namaste' left and right."</LD>
<LD>   Spending the afternoon with Tapper, as I did recently, is almost
as good as visiting Nepal, which the State Department discourages
because of an increasingly violent guerrilla war waged by Maoist
rebels. Tapper, a retiree in her 60s who lives in Van Nuys, has
visited Nepal seven times since 1990 and is active in the
America-Nepal Society of Southern California, which supports the
people and culture.</LD>
<TE>   Like many who keep returning to the tiny, troubled Himalayan
nation, Tapper has made dear friends there, paid to put Nepali
children through school, collected the country's arts and crafts, and
studied its religions.</TE>
<TE>   We met at the Pacific Asia Museum in Pasadena, where she guided me
through "Visions of Enlightenment: Understanding the Art of
Buddhism," a special exhibit with paintings (called thangkas),
mandalas, prayer beads and statues from all over the Buddhist world,
including Nepal. Though Tapper insists she is not an expert on
Buddhist art, she brought the exhibit alive for me by relating the
objects in it to her travels in Nepal.</TE>
<TE>   Looking at a prayer wheel, which devotees use to send prayers to
the deities without actually reciting the words, she recalled meeting
the father of a Nepalese friend who was masterfully multi-tasking by
watching a Hindi movie on a big-screen TV while turning his wheel. A
small, pagoda-shaped sculpture known as a stupa reminded her of
Boudhanath, a huge landmark Buddhist stupa in Katmandu, which, as one
of the last things she sees when leaving Nepal by plane, brings tears
to her eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "I know about 50 people who went to Nepal and never left," Tapper
told me later in the museum's Chinese courtyard.</TE>
<TE>   She meant it figuratively; in a sense, she never left. On her
first visit, in 1990, Tapper went trekking in the Khumbu region, a
standard tourist adventure that was, for her, an overwhelming
experience. She loved the mountains, of course, and the people --
their sense of humor, strong families and ability to be happy without
American-style luxuries.</TE>
<TE>   She also felt compelled to try to help the Nepalese, a common urge
among visitors, who often set up funds to educate children they meet
in Nepal. "It's very easy to be tremendously charitable. Twenty
dollars can make a big difference in a person's life there," Tapper
says.</TE>
<TE>   At a hotel in the town of Namche Bazaar, she saw a 7-year-old
servant girl carrying a heavy tray up narrow steps and tried to help
her. But the inn's owner wouldn't hear of it; Tapper was a guest, the
girl a menial meant for heavy lifting. When Tapper learned that the
child could not afford to go to school, she set up a bank account in
Nepal to finance her education, which cost just $15 a month. "At home
I dreamed of this little girl, feeling I was doing something
wonderful," Tapper says.</TE>
<TE>   Later she learned the girl never benefited because the money was
stolen. After that, Tapper gave through established charities, though
she and a group of friends who went trekking there recently are
putting the sister of their Sherpa guide through nursing school.</TE>
<TE>   After touring the Buddhist art exhibit, Tapper and I went to the
Tibet/Nepal House, a Pasadena restaurant, where we ate momos, or
dumplings, and a goat meat stew. "It's Dasain holiday time in Nepal
now, when every family has a goat to sacrifice," she told me. "So
it's a good time to be eating goat."</TE>
<TE>   I asked about her last visit to Nepal, in the fall of 2001. She
and friends went on another trek, despite the political unrest. They
had no problem, and the trails were almost empty, Tapper says. Still,
she acknowledges that the situation in Nepal frightens her. "A lot of
people e-mail me about whether to go trekking," she says. "I wouldn't
suggest it. But a lot of people are going anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year Tapper and her husband, Larry, went to Europe.
The widely traveled couple had been there before; this time they
visited Ireland and Iceland and loved both. "But going to Europe is
no stretch," she says. "There's no mystery about how people think
there. In Nepal people think differently."</TE>
<TE>   The couple is planning a trip to Cambodia and Vietnam in December.
Tapper wants to see Angkor Wat but has an ulterior motive. When they
get to Bangkok, they will phone friends in Nepal. If things seem
calm, they will go to Katmandu, although not trekking in the
countryside, where the rebels are most active.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't want to go to Asia and not go to Katmandu," she
says.</TE>

<LD>"Jeremy Thatcher: Dragon Hatcher"</LD>
<LD>   By Bruce Coville</LD>
<LD>   Jeremy Thatcher is an 11-year-old sixth-grade boy who wants to
become an artist. Everybody teases him for being the shortest kid,
but now it is worse -- they are teasing him for liking a girl named
Mary Lou. But he doesn't like her, she likes him.</LD>
<TE>   One day while Jeremy is walking home, Howard Morton and Freddie
the Frog Killer chase him. They make kissing noises and tease him.</TE>
<TE>   When he gets far away from them, he realizes that he is on the
wrong block, so he goes into a magic shop to ask for directions.</TE>
<TE>   In the magic shop, Jeremy finds a ball full of lots of color. The
owner says Jeremy won't want it, but it wants Jeremy, so he buys it
for a quarter.</TE>
<TE>   When Jeremy gets home, he reads the directions. They tell him that
on a full moon, you need to shine the ball up to the moon for three
hours. That night when he does it, the egg hatches and Jeremy gets a
dragon as a pet.</TE>
<TE>   Read the rest of the book to find out how Jeremy keeps the dragon
a secret and about all of his adventures.</TE>

<HD>'A Gift for Great-Gram'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martha Tolles</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>My great-gram is going to have a big birthday, and I want to get her
a good present. She's my grandma's mother, so she's really old and
she's really smart.</LD>
<LD>   She likes to make puns and riddles with words. Once she said to
me, "Brad, what's black and white and red all over?"</LD>
<LD>   I couldn't guess.</LD>
<TE>   She laughed. "It's a newspaper, and red is spelled r-e-a-d." She
talks about other words that sound alike but have different meanings,
like bus fare and a county fair.</TE>
<TE>   But none of this helps me think of a good gift for her.</TE>
<TE>   "Mom, can we go shopping?" I ask. Mom says yes, and I empty my
piggy bank. We go to a gift shop.</TE>
<TE>   "How about some perfume?" the salesgirl suggests.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes my great-gram sneeze."</TE>
<TE>   "Jewelry, then?"</TE>
<TE>   "She has a lot." I can't see anything in the whole shop that seems
special. I buy a good birthday card for her, though. It has a picture
of a cake, and when I scratch it, it smells like chocolate.</TE>
<TE>   But now I have only a few coins left. I'm discouraged.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't you think your nice card will be enough?" Mom asks.</TE>
<TE>   I don't think so, but I don't know what else to do.</TE>
<TE>   That afternoon we go to the party. Suddenly I get an idea. I count
out my coins carefully and then put some in the envelope with my
card. I add it to the stack of gifts in front of Great-gram.</TE>
<TE>   She opens my card first. She scratches the cake picture and
sniffs.</TE>
<TE>   "Yum-m-m. I love chocolate."</TE>
<TE>   Then she counts out the coins. "How smart." She smiles. "Just the
right amount, a cent for each year. Very sens-ible."</TE>
<TE>   "I get it," I say, beaming. "Don't you think I have a lot of
sense, Great-gram?"</TE>
<TE>   We laugh. I hope I grow up to be as smart as Great-gram and live
to be as old as she is. I've given her 100 cents.</TE>

<HD>His Exit Was Thoughtful, Just Like Everything Else</HD>

<BD>Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before practice every day, Morgan Wootten gave his DeMatha basketball
team a "Thought of the Day." Then, afterward, they would discuss what
it meant.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, he might say, "It wasn't raining when Noah built the
Ark." The next day, "The only person who welcomes change is a wet
baby." By Wednesday's practice, his legendary Stags would hear, "A
lighthouse does not blow a horn. It shines a light."</LD>
<LD>   To round out the week, Wootten might drag in Ben Franklin and
Harry Truman, fellows he taught about in his history classes. "Sin is
not harmful because it is forbidden. It is forbidden because it is
harmful," said Franklin. Truman gets credit for "How far would Moses
have gone if he had taken a poll in Egypt?"</LD>
<TE>   Within Washington sports, Wootten, who retired Wednesday, should
get as much credit, in the broadest sense of that word, as anybody
who's been on the local scene in the last half-century.</TE>
<TE>   In his 51 years as a coach, 46 of them at DeMatha High in
Hyattsville, Md., where his teams went 1,274-192 and won five
mythical national titles, Wootten was not always perfect. In his
early years, he was as ambitious and competitive as they come. But,
once he got to the top, no sports figure in this town aged better,
grew wiser, spread his influence more generously or used it for
better purposes.</TE>
<TE>   True to form, when Wootten retired, he left at exactly the right
time for the proper reasons. Even though the announcement, just two
weeks before the start of the season, came as a total shock.</TE>
<TE>   Wootten, 71, didn't retire because of health. The new liver he got
in 1996, after nearly dying from a Big Bleed that left him, at one
point, with no pulse, is excellent. He still breaks 90 on the golf
course on a good day. His huge summer basketball camp, charity
activities and connections with DeMatha will continue. There are even
plans for a new DeMatha fieldhouse at some point.</TE>
<TE>   "I gotta do something this next half-century," he says.</TE>
<TE>   However, there is spin on his out-of-the-blue retirement,
according to sources. And it's typical Wootten. Somebody threw a
trick defense at him a while back; this time, he apparently figured
out how to beat it. Several years ago, Wootten hoped his son Joe, now
the O'Connell coach, would succeed him. Everybody went goofy. Search
committees. Trinitarian fingers in the pie. Joe didn't get the job.
Morgan was "very disappointed" in some people.</TE>
<TE>   So this time, it appears he's finessed them. Five-year assistant
Mike Jones, 29, will now get a full year to prove himself as interim
coach. Jones can't be "searched" over for somebody more famous. No
time. Also, Jones will be DeMatha's first African American coach of a
major sport. That pleases Morgan.</TE>
<TE>   Why wait until after summer camps, after preseason work? "If I had
gone [earlier], there might have been some mischief," said Wootten,
meaning coaches from Arlington to Alaska might have tried to steal
stars from the most famous schoolboy program of the last several
decades. Why put your school, your replacement and your young players
through that wringer? Let everybody chill out.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'd announced it a year ago, they'd have given me rocking
chairs before every game. It would have taken attention from the
team," he said by phone Wednesday. "It would have embarrassed me to
death. I've had enough accolades. I've had my day in the sun."</TE>
<TE>   Even though Wootten said two years ago that he'd probably only
coach two more seasons, his final decision was difficult. So he
talked to two Hall of Fame coaches who would really understand his
situation -- Red Auerbach and John Wooden.</TE>
<TE>   "In different ways, they said the same thing," said Wootten. "It's
just a gut feeling. And you'll know.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, we had 29 and 32 wins the last two seasons and ended last
year with an 18-game winning streak. We won everything you could win.
It couldn't have gotten any better. And the program is in great shape
for Mike."</TE>
<TE>   Wootten has always taught his players about priorities: God,
family, school, basketball -- in that order. Use basketball, don't be
used by it. Last year, he had to play his son's team four times,
winning three, including his last game. "They're not fun games, to be
very honest," he said. "Somebody in the family has to lose." At 71,
how often do you want to thwart your 29-year-old son?</TE>
<TE>   "At some point, I have to back down. As it says in Ecclesiastes,
'Under heaven there is a time for everything,' " Wootten said . "And
this is the right time for me to retire."</TE>
<TE>   At the end, you're supposed to think about the beginning. So,
Wednesday, Wootten did. When young, he thought he might be a lawyer,
maybe go into politics. One day, he arranged for a buddy, Tommy
Clark, to try for a job coaching baseball at an orphanage.</TE>
<TE>   "Sister Batilde of the Order of the Holy Cross was telling Clark
about the job and Tommy started getting cold feet," said Wootten. "He
said, 'Morgan is a candidate, too.' I wasn't and I didn't even know
much about baseball. The Sister looked at me and said, 'The pay is
$75 a month. We practice every day. I'll see you on Monday.'</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know how to say, 'No.' "</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Wootten figures he taught world history to four
classes of 30 boys each for 33 years. For the last 40 years, he's
averaged about 1,500 kids a summer at his camps and clinics. That
doesn't include all those DeMatha players. So many accomplished so
much that the school has lost count of how many played in the NBA
("more than a dozen"), got college scholarships ("more than 150") or
became coaches ("more than 20"). Except for the day they put him in
the Basketball Hall of Fame, you may not have seen Wootten on ESPN
too often. Though he had countless college offers, he took the road
less traveled. In the last 50 years, this area has had athletes and
coaches more famous than Wootten, though not many. But it has never
produced one who was more worthy of the description "most valuable."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday, one of Wootten's old stars, Adrian Branch, was in the
DeMatha library when Wootten said his last coaching goodbye, safe now
from any rocking chairs or too much embarrassing praise.</TE>
<TE>   Branch remembered one of those Thoughts of the Day. "If you want
to know about the fruit," said Branch, "check the root."</TE>

<HD>Free Diving Death Spurs Safety Debate</HD>
<DH>Sport is considered to be at a crossroads after a
world-record holder dies in the Dominican Republic attempting to
break a mark.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Death, like pressure and speed, is a constant companion for the few
who engage in the little-known but brazen sport of "no limits" free
diving.</LD>
<LD>   Participants take a single deep breath, then submerge with the use
of weighted sleds mounted on taut cables, plummeting hundreds of feet
in about a minute -- without oxygen tanks.</LD>
<LD>   At the end of the trip, the weight is dropped and the diver races
to surface like a bullet. There's no need to decompress to avoid "the
bends" because no air has entered the body.</LD>
<TE>   "Free diving is getting in touch with yourself. It's very quiet
and peaceful feeling, and you get to understand your body," said
Carlos Serra, president of the Miami-based International Association
of Free Divers or IAFD.</TE>
<TE>   "You need to know what your body is telling you and when you need
to go to the surface and breathe."</TE>
<TE>   But the sport is at an apparent crossroads, divers say. The recent
death of a popular world-record holder in the Dominican Republic has
sparked intense debate about safety and who's in charge.</TE>
<TE>   Free diving, or breath-hold diving, existed before the days of
fishing trawlers and scuba gear. Swimmers used the technique to
search for the fish and shellfish that sustained civilizations in the
Mediterranean, the Caribbean and other parts of the world.</TE>
<TE>   Competitions emerged, and groups were organized to oversee events.
Besides the depth diving or "no limits" branch of the sport, there
are also "dynamic" free diving competitions where they see who can
swim the farthest underwater on one breath. There are also
competitions for staying underwater the longest.</TE>
<TE>   The sport's popularity is greater outside the United States.
Divers participate in Internet forums and keep in contact in
cyberspace, relating tales of broken records.</TE>
<TE>   Annabel Briseno, 51, owns world records in dynamic free diving.</TE>
<TE>   Using a weighted belt and fins, she swam more than 440 feet on one
breath at a competition in Hawaii overseen by the International
Association for the Development of Apnea, a Swiss-based free diving
body independent of Serra's group.</TE>
<TE>   Briseno says much of a free diver's training takes place on land,
with running and breathing exercises serving as preludes to a foray
into the sea or a swimming pool. In the water, divers should never
train alone.</TE>
<TE>   Free divers can hold their breath for up to three minutes, but
blackouts from a lack of oxygen do occur.</TE>
<TE>   Serra says the body can preserve oxygen by redirecting blood flow
from the extremities to the main organs, such as the heart, brain and
liver.</TE>
<TE>   No-limits divers can regulate their heart to 20 beats per minute
or less -- the normal adult resting heart rate is between 60 and 80.
They also flush their sinuses and ears with water to combat the
fierce effects of pressure as the diver drops.</TE>
<TE>   "They put their bodies in a mode of trying to ... learn to control
the urge to breathe," Serra said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite these adaptations, the "shallow water blackout" phenomena,
which occurs when the brain uses up its oxygen, can cause the diver
to pass out and possibly drown. It normally happens near the end of
the dive, Briseno said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you do blackout, it really undermines your confidence and
creates a physiological fear response," said Briseno, who has blacked
out several times. "You do not want to have that panic attack when
you're free diving. It takes me about a month to get my mental status
back in shape."</TE>
<TE>   The main draw for Briseno is the peace she feels while underwater.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you go under the pressure, you are in a feeling of
weightlessness and euphoria where you are one with the ocean," she
said. "It's so meditative because nothing else is going on in the
world at that moment. It's like a transcendental experience."</TE>
<TE>   Serra, whose organization is among a handful that oversee free
diving, is partners with one of the world's most famous free divers,
Francisco "Pipin" Ferreras.</TE>
<TE>   Ferreras' 28-year-old wife, Audrey Mestre, drowned Oct. 12 while
trying to break her husband's IAFD record of 531.5 feet achieved off
Cozumel, Mexico, in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   A dive to 561 feet that should have taken just three minutes
lasted more than 8 1/2 minutes. Mestre's body was limp when her
husband brought her to the surface.</TE>
<TE>   Mestre, of St. Denis, France, reached her target depth of 561 feet
but experienced problems on her way up, Serra said. Her last dive
wasn't a record because she didn't complete it, but the IAFD has
posthumously recognized a dive to 558 feet completed by Mestre Oct. 9
in practice as a world record.</TE>
<TE>   The death has ignited a dispute among divers and fans. Serra and
Ferreras were inundated with criticism on Internet forums and from
fellow free divers. They were blamed for failing to have adequate
safety divers and medical staff, and covering up any mistakes that
were made. Serra vehemently denies such criticism.</TE>
<TE>   Ricardo Hernandez, who began his own free diving and spearfishing
school after being fired from the IAFD two years ago, says Serra and
Ferreras are hiding information.</TE>
<TE>   They have not released a video made during the dive using a camera
attached to the sled and failed to disclose information from
computerized depth gauges secured to Mestre's body during the dive,
Hernandez said. He also questions why Ferreras had to dive in to save
his wife when there were supposedly plenty of safety personnel in the
water.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a general outcry and an uproar in the diving community,"
Hernandez said. "The video has always been shown to public after each
successful record. The video will be proof of how many divers were
there.</TE>
<TE>   "Audrey's death became a tragedy and it's becoming a tragicomedy
perhaps because there are so many facts people don't know a month
after she died," he said. "Carlos and Pipin have a complete conflict
of interest and their lack of disclosure is a total mockery."</TE>
<TE>   Ferreras has declined interview requests since his wife's death,
speaking to reporters only during a memorial service last month. But
Serra insists there were enough safety divers and emergency medical
personnel present. He says Hernandez is a disgruntled former employee
who is seeking attention through "sickening" personal attacks.</TE>
<TE>   He says that little information has been released out of respect
to Mestre's parents and Ferreras, who need time to grieve.</TE>
<TE>   "The investigation continues. There is no cover-up. We have to
understand the painful process of healing," Serra said.</TE>
<TE>   Serra said he expects to release information surrounding Mestre's
death later this month. However, he acknowledged Thursday that the
sled malfunctioned and stopped while Mestre was at about 530 feet.</TE>
<TE>   A safety diver stationed near the bottom of the line saw that
Mestre had fainted and began taking her to the surface.</TE>
<TE>   Ferreras eventually dove in with an air tank to bring his wife up.</TE>
<TE>   While Mestre's death has been felt throughout the diving
community, participants say such danger is ever-present and must be
accepted.</TE>
<TE>   "The ocean is more powerful than you. You have to make a major
peace with the ocean and realize every time you go out you can die,"
said Briseno.</TE>

<HD>'The Future' of Wizards, Hamilton Now in Past</HD>
<DH>Guard was once hot property in Washington, but a summer
trade to Detroit has been an education on life in the NBA.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sean Deveney</AU>
<BD>Sporting News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It has been 3 1/2 years since the Washington Wizards made Richard
Hamilton the seventh overall pick in the NBA draft, and Hamilton
still remembers his first conversations with Wizards officials, still
remembers his introduction to the franchise.</LD>
<LD>   "It seemed like every person in the organization was telling me I
was going to be the future of the team," Hamilton says. "I believed
it."</LD>
<LD>   He was wrong to believe it. Hamilton is not in Washington anymore,
thanks to a summer trade that sent him to Detroit and snapped him out
of his youthful naivete. Now, he can't help but wonder what happened
to the Wizards' promise of a youth movement. Last season, Michael
Jordan returned to the NBA with the Wizards to, as he said, "teach
the young guys," particularly Hamilton and Courtney Alexander.
Instead, the Wizards dealt Hamilton and Alexander in the off-season
and stockpiled veterans Jerry Stackhouse, Larry Hughes, Bryon Russell
and Charles Oakley in a set of moves aimed at winning this year,
Jordan's last.</LD>
<TE>   "When I first got there," Hamilton says, "we were a veteran team,
and they cleared everybody out and said, 'OK, we are going to build a
young team.' And they made it seem like I was in the middle of that.
It seemed like we had all the right ingredients. We were starting to
build something. We were going forward. Now, it seems like they went
right back to what they were before I got there. A lot of old guys,
and I am not sure what their future is."</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton says he is disappointed that he did not get the chance to
finish what he started in Washington. He averaged 20 points last year
and helped the Wizards to their best record in four years. His
disappointment, though, is tempered by his current situation with the
Pistons. It's one of the league's deepest teams, and it's coming off
a 50-win season. Much of the team's success was credited to
Stackhouse, who averaged 21.4 points, 5.3 assists and 4.1 rebounds
last season, and Hamilton now must assume Stackhouse's role as lead
scorer.</TE>
<TE>   But Hamilton is a much different player than Stackhouse. Though
the perception is that the Pistons got fleeced in the deal, giving up
Stackhouse because they did not want to award him a contract
extension, the reality is Hamilton could be a better fit in Coach
Rick Carlisle's offense. Stackhouse is a player who operates best
with the ball in his hands, making slashing moves to the basket.
Hamilton works best using screens and shooting midrange jumpers.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he is the best midrange shooter in the game, coming off
screens and catching the ball in that area, curling in there and
shooting," says Wizard Coach Doug Collins. "He is going to fit well
with them. Rick runs a lot of plays for him that are the same plays
he ran in Indiana for Reggie Miller. Rip is getting a lot of those
same kinds of plays."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, there is the perception Stackhouse was the player the
Pistons relied on in the clutch. That's not necessarily true -- the
Pistons were just as likely to use Jon Barry, Corliss Williamson and
Clifford Robinson in pressure situations, and Stackhouse's
performance in the playoffs last year (32.1 percent shooting) was not
an example of performing under pressure. Besides, Hamilton was a
clutch shooter when he led Connecticut to a national championship and
often took the big shots for the Wizards last season.</TE>
<TE>   "I have won games before," Hamilton says. "I think I have a good
understanding of what it takes to win the tight ones."</TE>
<TE>   For Carlisle, the concern about Hamilton was his defense. Carlisle
pushed defense last year, and the Pistons responded. He was worried
about bringing in a guy who, he had heard, was incapable of playing
tough defense. Carlisle decided not to make judgments before watching
Hamilton on a daily basis.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, he has proven everyone wrong," Carlisle says. "There was a
lot of talk about how this guy was not a good defender, but I kept an
open mind. We've liked what we have seen. His effort is there, and he
is willing to work at it."</TE>
<TE>   The Pistons may be better with Hamilton, and they may be prepared
to build their future around him, but the experience in Washington
has made Hamilton remain guarded about that sort of thing. He now is
in his fourth season, which means he will be a restricted free agent
next summer. He was eligible for a contract extension last summer,
which was part of the reason the Wizards traded him. He will be a
restricted free agent next summer, and he knows staying in Detroit is
not a sure thing.</TE>
<TE>   "In Washington, I was through the bad, and through the good," he
says. "I was beginning to think, 'This is going to be my home.' I did
not know any better. It was something where they always expressed
that I was the future of the team. So, it's a no-brainer, right? Of
course I will be there if I am the future, right? Well, no.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, it's a situation where I thought about it more [in

coaches, everything. I am just enjoying basketball, and I can't take
anything for granted. I am here to play basketball right now.
Everything else will just fall into place."</TE>

<HD>Richter's Ranger Roots Run Deep</HD>
<DH>Goalie has spent entire career in New York and he's still
protecting the net.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Mike Richter found out his NHL debut was just a day away when Hall of
Famer Phil Esposito gave him the news at practice.</LD>
<LD>   The first set of tasks from his new coach was simple: Get in the
net at Madison Square Garden, shut down Mario Lemieux and the
high-flying Pittsburgh Penguins, and keep the New York Rangers from
playoff elimination.</LD>
<LD>   He wasn't able to pull all that off, but 13 years and 300 wins
later Richter is still the one the Rangers count on in goal.</LD>
<TE>   "There are so many things that you can't predict," Richter said.</TE>
<TE>   He was speaking of all the years that followed his unique entrance
into the NHL. Richter has always worn the red, white and blue of the
Rangers -- the team that drafted him out of high school in
Philadelphia Flyers territory.</TE>
<TE>   Richter became the 19th goalie to reach 300 victories last month
when the Rangers beat Phoenix. He's only the third player to spend
his whole career with one team and reach that mark.</TE>
<TE>   "What's fortunate for me is I've been part of an exceptionally run
organization for all these years," Richter said. "I've had so many
great players and great teams around me."</TE>
<TE>   New York found him in the second round of the 1985 draft while he
was living in Abington, Pa. Richter went on to play two years at
Wisconsin and then to the 1988 Olympic team. He finished that season
in the IHL and played one more before coming to New York in the
spring.</TE>
<TE>   Richter served as a backup twice before getting the shocking news
that he would start for New York, with the team down 3-0 in a
best-of-seven, first-round series.</TE>
<TE>   Esposito, the GM, fired coach Michel Bergeron with two games
remaining in the regular season and took over. He lost five straight
contests before turning to the 22-year-old Richter to replace John
Vanbiesbrouck.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted to get myself in there and get a win," Richter, 36,
said. "It didn't happen perfectly, but it was an awful lot of fun."</TE>
<TE>   The Penguins completed the sweep with a 4-3 win, but that isn't
what sticks out in Richter's mind now.</TE>
<TE>   "I can remember the first couple of shifts of the game, Lemieux
and (Paul) Coffey came down on a 2-on-0," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If not for a major injury to his left knee in 2000 and then to his
right in 2001, or for two decisions he made to stay with the Rangers
when free agency called, Richter's milestone victory would've come
sooner and possibly somewhere else.</TE>
<TE>   There was doubt as late as last season that Richter would reach
No. 300 in New York. He missed the final nine games after a skull
fracture when he was struck by a shot.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't really get too far ahead of yourself if you can help
it, and because of that you're probably less aware of a lot of the
milestones," Richter said. "They sneak up, and then they're
acknowledged. You give pause for a second and then you go back to
work."</TE>
<TE>   Richter entered last offseason four wins away and without a
contract. On July 4, he signed a two-year deal worth $8 million to
stay.</TE>
<TE>   "I always felt a strong allegiance to this team and this
organization," said Richter, the winningest goalie in Ranger history.</TE>
<TE>   And in doing that, he has been able to form a core trio with
captain Mark Messier and Brian Leetch. In 1994, they led the Rangers
to their first Stanley Cup championship in 54 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, that year there were so many great memories, so much
success, so many great feelings that it's tough to sort them out and
keep them all in perspective," Richter said. "I think you do that
more when you're finished playing."</TE>
<TE>   Leetch and Richter have been together since 1989, and their 14
seasons as teammates is tops among current NHL players.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been able to play and be here because he's been successful,"
Leetch said. "He's worked hard and that's the biggest reason."</TE>
<TE>   Messier won five Stanley Cups with Edmonton, before being traded
to New York in 1991. For so long, Messier was linked with goalie
Grant Fuhr, who backstopped the Oiler dynasty.</TE>
<TE>   Incredibly, Messier has played only one season fewer with Richter
than the decade he spent with Fuhr.</TE>
<TE>   "That's amazing. It goes so fast," Richter said.</TE>
<TE>   Messier would've had more time with Richter if he didn't go to
Vancouver for three years after the 1997 playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody has worked as hard at his game than Richter," said
Messier, who returned two years ago. "Coming off two major knee
surgeries as a goalie is unbelievable. Not many guys would be able to
do it, and it goes to show what kind of character he has."</TE>
<TE>   As for comparisons to Fuhr, Messier said they were very different
except that both were at their best in the big games.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike's a real pro," said Coach Bryan Trottier, who played against
Richter during his Hall of Fame career. "He wants to be a wall in
net."</TE>
<TE>   Pavel Bure has only been Richter's teammate since late last
season. But they were brought together by a moment during the 1994
finals when Bure starred for Vancouver.</TE>
<TE>   Bure was awarded a penalty shot in Game 4. Richter turned him
away, sparking the Rangers to the win and a 3-1 series lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't make another move," Bure said. "I think I did
everything right, but in that situation he outplayed me and made a
great save."</TE>
<TE>   Richter and Bure both said that they haven't reminisced since
they've shared a locker room. It was so long ago and now they are
trying to get the Rangers back into the playoffs after a five-year
absence.</TE>
<TE>   "I still hope my best memories are ahead of me," Richter said. "I
really believe this team can win the Stanley Cup. I believe in this
organization."</TE>

<HD>What, Him Worry?</HD>
<DH>Webber focuses on NBA, even as trial approaches</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Barker</AU>
<BD>Newsday</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Chris Webber does not worry. It's not his style.</LD>
<LD>   He doesn't worry about Shaquille O'Neal and the trash-talking
Lakers. He doesn't worry that they simply have his team's number,
that he will forever be denied a championship trophy because the team
O'Neal calls the "Sacramento Queens" just keeps finding new ways to
hand the Lakers a Western Conference title.</LD>
<LD>   Nor does Webber worry about what could be an even bigger stumbling
block to his championship aspirations: that he might have to face a
perjury trial in Michigan in the middle of this season.</LD>
<TE>   On Sept. 9 -- a little more than three months after his team's
overtime loss to the Lakers in Game 7 of the West finals -- Webber
and several of his family members were charged with conspiring to
obstruct justice and lying to a federal grand jury. But you wouldn't
know it from talking to him Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, I'd say I'm at peace and that's good," Webber said
last week. "I'm just focused on winning a championship."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings don't like to talk about Webber's Michigan situation.
Coach Rick Adelman has called it a distraction only in the context
that the media keeps bringing it up. Yet, come December, the Kings
could find out just how major a distraction it will be.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Nancy G. Edmunds has set a Dec. 9 date, when
attorneys for both sides will debate how much longer they will need
before going to trial, which means it won't open until at least
January. The charge against Webber, his father and his aunt stem from
testimony they gave two years ago to a grand jury that was
investigating Ed Martin, a University of Michigan basketball booster.</TE>
<TE>   Webber, who has pleaded not guilty, could be in for the fight of
his life.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, he could end up in the big house, and by saying that
we don't mean Michigan Stadium. Two of the four counts against Webber
could each result in five years in prison, though legal experts have
said a guilty plea would garner him as little as home confinement.</TE>
<TE>   Webber said he can't discuss the case, but when asked how
confident he was that he would come out on top after his day in
court, Webber said, "Very confident."</TE>
<TE>   Though Webber has never been in this kind of trouble before, he is
no stranger to controversy.</TE>
<TE>   It began his rookie season, when he and Don Nelson went at it in
Golden State. It dogged him in Washington, where he was arrested, but
later acquitted, for marijuana possession, resisting arrest and
second-degree assault in connection with a traffic incident.</TE>
<TE>   Webber, however, has maintained his focus on the court since
coming to Sacramentoand has become the main cog in the team's hopes
for an NBA championship. There are many out there who think this
should be the Kings' season; their talent is deeper than the Lakers
and they have finally experienced the requisite heartbreak needed to
become a champion.</TE>
<TE>   Webber, however, believes his season was last season. Because of
that, he's almost on a mission to right what he feels is an egregious
wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to say that this year is my best chance, but last year
was my best chance," he said. "Hopefully, this year, we can make the
most out of it. I am excited about the opportunity to win a
championship. It feels good to have a chance. It feels good to
believe not just because you have faith in yourself, but because you
have faith in your teammates."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings have struggled with injuries, including those to Mike
Bibby and Scot Pollard, in the early going this season.</TE>
<TE>   Webber, who is coming off an ankle sprain, has sat out a four of
the Kings' first seven games because of the injury this season. And
the Kings remain a favorite to win the Pacific and have set their
sights higher: shutting up the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Bad blood between the two teams escalated in the preseason when
Doug Christie and Rick Fox went at it, and ended up with suspensions
for Christie (two games) and Fox (six games).</TE>
<TE>   "They've won championships, so anything they do, people are going
to say it was a mental game," Webber said. "They'll say it was a
preparation game. It wasn't them getting out of character or getting
scared or making certain comments about certain guys' family members.
On the street, that's something you would get your head knocked off
for.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't about trying to beat someone in a war of words or
prove something. To me, if we don't have a championship at the end of
the year, all we proved is that we could talk."</TE>
<TE>   Webber sees a championship as a way to reward those who have stuck
by him, both the fans in Sacramento and in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Webber, once a hero in his home state, has taken a bit of a
beating in Michigan this off-season. But in characteristic fashion,
he said he is not letting it bother him.</TE>
<TE>   "In the city of Detroit, I have their support," Webber said. "In
the suburbs, you know how that goes. There are people who support
you, and people who don't. You have to make the best out of it. If
I'm ever so lucky to win a championship, it will be for the people
who support me back there too."</TE>

<HD>No Passing Marks for Brady Targets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Oates</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One thing about New England quarterback Tom Brady that makes him a
candidate for best active quarterback is that he is successful
without a cast of great pass receivers.</LD>
<LD>   As the Chicago Bears will see today, the only first-class receiver
in the Patriot lineup, Troy Brown, moves around on an injured leg.</LD>
<LD>   The Patriots' other receivers are too slow, too inexperienced, or
too deficient in NFL talent.</LD>
<TE>   Yet last week, Brady passed for 265 yards, completing 22 of 26,
and beating former teammate Drew Bledsoe in Buffalo, 38-7.</TE>
<TE>   On the game's decisive plays, when none of Brady's wide receivers
could get open, he threw the ball to some of his backs instead, or to
tight ends. In the circumstances, it was the game of the year for a
passer in this league.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Belichick Throws</TE>
<TE>   For the Patriot coach, Bill Belichick, the Buffalo game was a
coaching masterpiece. He won because he kept Brady at it. He kept him
throwing because of his faith that Brady could find somebody open.</TE>
<TE>   Belichick could see that New England's wide receivers were mired
in the Buffalo defense. But last year, Belichick had handpicked Brady
over Bledsoe, and he knows he was right about that.</TE>
<TE>   Belichick also won because he knows defensive football so well.</TE>
<TE>   In a must-win game, this is the guy you want in charge of your
defense.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots should have enough pass-receiving class to handle the
Bears today -- but it may not be enough to get them another Super
Bowl title. Their problems were best illustrated last week whenever
flanker Brown was running a crossing pattern.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, when throwing to Brown on such a play, Brady threw too
far in front of him. He remembered Brown's preinjury speed and
couldn't adjust. Few passers have ever been able to adjust in such a
predicament. The right timing with a good receiver is hard enough to
get in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bills' Receivers Better</TE>
<TE>   The difference in class between New England's receivers and
Buffalo's resembles the difference between college and pro ball. On
the Buffalo team, Bledsoe can choose between wide receivers who have
been the two most productive in the league for most of the last two
months.</TE>
<TE>   They are split end Eric Moulds, who compares with any receiver in
football except San Francisco's Terrell Owens, and flanker Peerless
Price.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, fullback Larry Centers, who plays a key role in
Buffalo's pass-pattern network, compares with any pass-catching
fullback in football.</TE>
<TE>   A week ago, in other words, Bledsoe had a large advantage over
Brady in downfield help.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Bledsoe's excellence as a passer, his fast start in
Buffalo this season has been in large part attributable to the
excellence he found there in the receiving positions -- to his
obvious surprise -- following the mediocrity he had put up with in
New England while losing his job to Brady.</TE>
<TE>   Football fans and critics measuring one passer against another
these days are prone to overlook the differences in supporting casts
that quarterbacks all have.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, one of hall-of-famer Joe Montana's assets was wide receiver
Jerry Rice, who at 40 is still better than most of his peers.</TE>
<TE>   One of quarterback Peyton Manning's assets is the smooth
Indianapolis wide receiver, Marvin Harrison. And so on.</TE>
<TE>   Brady had a guy like that last year, Troy Brown, but he doesn't
really have him now. In the passer ratings, Brady rates extra points
because of whom he has to throw to.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Support Counts</TE>
<TE>   In running back comparisons as well, football's fans and critics
might well give more weight to the differences in supporting casts.</TE>
<TE>   In San Francisco, for example, the alternating featured backs,
Garrison Hearst and Kevan Barlow, good as they are, benefit hugely
from the excellence of teammates Jeff Garcia, the quarterback, and
Owens.</TE>
<TE>   Theirs is an excellence of an order that is completely unknown to,
for example, Cincinnati running back Corey Dillon.</TE>
<TE>   As Dillon again averaged over four yards in 22 carries last
Sunday, the Bengals finally won their first game of the season but
only because they lined up against the expansion Houston Texans, whom
they smacked, 38-3.</TE>
<TE>   For the last four or five years, considering the lack of overall
quality in the Cincinnati organization, Dillon probably should have
ranked as the NFL's No. 1 running back.</TE>
<TE>   Of the many reasons I continue to rate O.J. Simpson as No. 1
all-time at that position, one explanation is the way he rose above
his mediocre supporting cast in Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   Drafted first by the worst pro club of its day, Simpson twice
rushed for 1,800 or more yards on a team that was otherwise bereft of
first-class quality at quarterback, wide receiver and other
positions, and on the coaching staff.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, Jim Brown played for a hall-of-fame coach who was
so able that his team, the Cleveland Browns, was named for him -- for
the man who for decades was an Ohio football idol, Paul Brown -- the
only time such a thing ever happened in this sport.</TE>
<TE>   Powerful running-back candidates for 1-2 all-time remain Simpson
and Walter Payton of Chicago, who until his old age as a Bear was
stuck on bad teams that rose only occasionally to mediocrity.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Injuries Decisive</TE>
<TE>   Longevity is a different kind of quality in ballcarriers. As every
football fan knows, the top two all-time in running back longevity
are Payton and Emmitt Smith of the Dallas Cowboys. Thus,
unsurprisingly, Smith and Payton are 1-2 in yards gained.</TE>
<TE>   Most other NFL runners -- even the finest of the others -- have
burned out or been rendered ineffective by injuries after an average
of three or four seasons.</TE>
<TE>   So there have always been and still are two categories of
greatness at this position -- those who perform gloriously for a
while before breaking up and those who last gloriously.</TE>
<TE>   Among today's running backs who have at times resembled the best
you can name all-time -- except lately -- four are Eddie George of
Tennessee, Edgerrin James of Indianapolis, Stephen Davis of
Washington, and, of course, the recently retired Terrell Davis of
Denver.</TE>
<TE>   It was injuries that slowed them all down prematurely.</TE>
<TE>   Like quarterbacks, ballcarriers are marked targets for the
defensive hitters who manage to knock most of them out. And only
rarely does any injured great back come all the way back. Instead,
when one does return, he typically plays awhile at reduced speed on
the instincts that made him what he was, then fades away.</TE>
<TE>   One exception is San Francisco's Hearst, who after a serious leg
injury missed a season but who at the cost of long, painful
rehabilitation has returned to preinjury form.</TE>
<TE>   More typical is Gale Sayers, the short-lived (more exactly
short-careered) all-pro who is often ranked with Jim Brown and O.J.
Simpson in the all-time top three, though he couldn't regain
preinjury form.</TE>
<TE>   With reason, some have called their position the saddest bastion
of football.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Faulk Amazing</TE>
<TE>   The Ram star, Marshall Faulk, is still another kind of running
back, one who could more accurately be referred to as a ball-advancer
than ballcarrier. Faulk has shown more ways to move his club forward
than perhaps any other running back since the NFL began.</TE>
<TE>   The 3-5 Rams therefore, after an 0-5 start, could get back into
the playoff race this year if only they were in a different division.</TE>
<TE>   Their problem is that division rival San Francisco (6-2) is in the
season's handful of big winners in a 32-team league that boasts no
fewer than 22 teams with, already, four or more defeats.</TE>
<TE>   In an offense that presents a constant threat with passer Marc
Bulger and runner Faulk, Faulk's style is unique. As his team won
again last weekend, outscoring division rival Arizona, 27-14, Faulk
advanced the Rams 278 yards in rushes and catches that showcased him
once more as the most amazing running back of his time.</TE>
<TE>   What he did to Arizona was exactly what every situation called for
whenever he had the ball.</TE>
<TE>   When necessary, for example, Faulk advanced the Rams while running
closer behind his blockers than any peer.</TE>
<TE>   Or, when a quick-opening play was there, he again accelerated with
more speed and better instincts than any other active running back.
Or, after a catch, he did the same.</TE>
<TE>   Faulk's ability to make timely, often full-speed cuts is also
unparalleled today and reminiscent of only two or three others before
his time, among them Sayers and Simpson.</TE>
<TE>   If he isn't quite in their class, it's only because the game has
changed so much in the last 60 years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Five More Picks</TE>
<TE>   Here are five guesses on the five big games this weekend:</TE>
<TE>   * San Francisco to win by two or three points over Kansas City at
3Com Park. As good as the Chiefs have become, they're still a year
away from beating teams like this.</TE>
<TE>   * Miami by six over the New York Jets at East Rutherford, N.J.:
The Jets, 2-0 in their last two, are improving, but not yet by enough
to overcome the Dolphin defense.</TE>
<TE>   * Host St. Louis by seven over San Diego. The Chargers will
penetrate the Ram defense, and I wouldn't be surprised if they won,
but a Ram defeat would be more surprising.</TE>
<TE>   * New England by seven over Chicago in Champaign on the field that
made Red Grange famous. Offensive play selection will undo a Bear
team regaining form defensively.</TE>
<TE>   * Denver by seven over Oakland on Monday night in Denver. This one
might not be easy for the Broncos, but they do seem to be hitting
playoff stride.</TE>

<HD>Reopening the 'Hunter' Case Files</HD>
<DH>NBC dives into retro TV by reuniting the cast and creators
of the '80s cop show for the first of two movies this season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Admit it. Part of the fun of watching a reunion movie or special of a
favorite television series from years past is to see how the stars
have weathered the test of time. In the cases of Fred Dryer and
Stepfanie Kramer, time has been very, very kind to the stars of the
cop series "Hunter," which was seen on NBC from 1984 to 1991.</LD>
<LD>   The two have reprised their roles as police detectives Rick Hunter
and Dee Dee McCall for "Hunter: Return to Justice," the first of two
"Hunter" TV movies scheduled to be broadcast this season on NBC. The
action-thriller premieres Saturday night, the same night the series
aired during its successful run.</LD>
<LD>   Granted, Dryer wears bifocals in one scene in the film, but the
former New York Giant and Los Angeles Ram, now 56, is in great shape
as he chases down the bad guys on foot and even on a motorcycle. And
Kramer, 46, is as lithe and sophisticated as she was 18 years ago.</LD>
<TE>   "We just stepped back into it," Kramer says. "It was like riding a
bicycle."</TE>
<TE>   Dryer made the last "Hunter" movie, "The Return of Hunter," in
1994 without Kramer, who was pregnant at the time with her daughter,
Lily. He says it's taken this long to get the network interested in
the franchise because "I think it's where TV's been. TV's been on
this path to serve groups and target audiences and demographics."</TE>
<TE>   But now, he adds, "there is a retro movement [on TV], and this is
certainly a part of that. They realize America is still out there
watching TV. The 'Hunter' shows are going to stimulate people to come
back to network TV and say, 'I want to watch those guys.' "</TE>
<TE>   In "Return to Justice," Hunter's integrity is called into question
after a drug bust goes bad. After a police investigation, he takes
time off from his job and travels to San Diego to see his former
partner McCall, who is about to marry the city's mayoral candidate
(Sam Hennings). Hunter is soon called into service to help McCall
when her fiance kills an intruder in a home robbery.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Dryer and Kramer, the movie reunites the team of Frank
Lupo, who created the series, and Stephen J. Cannell, who was a
producer and writer on the original "Hunter." Lupo wrote the
screenplay and served as executive producer with Cannell.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if you are going to do one of these, you need to bring
everybody who was in the original back," says Cannell. "I wouldn't
have done it without Stepfanie and Fred and Frank."</TE>
<TE>   Cannell, who produced eight "The Rockford Files" reunion movies
for CBS, says the trick in resurrecting a series as a movie is
"telling a story where there is something at stake for the
characters. Frank and I worked these stories out for the first two
movies together and plotted them. We were very careful in the
plotting of the stories that Hunter had something at stake and Dee
Dee had something at stake. So if you do that, then you have a good
character story to tell and a good crime story."</TE>
<TE>   Dryer and Kramer attended NBC's 75th anniversary party in New York
last January, which gave the actors the opportunity to talk with NBC
Entertainment President Jeff Zucker. "He said, 'I want you back on
the network,' " Dryer recalls. Dryer talked about his idea for a
detective series set in Palm Springs -- "there is a script order for
that" -- as well as resurrecting "Hunter" as a movie series. The
network agreed, but with a less-than-lavish budget, Dryer suggests.</TE>
<TE>   "We did them non-union with a limited amount of funds and
licensing fees," Dryer says. "It was very tough to do. The movie you
saw was prepped in eight days and shot in 15. I worked with Frank for
about six weeks. We knew we had no money and no time. I said I am not
about to take a franchise we worked the last 20 years at and trash it
... to help NBC fill a void. The only way I wanted to do it and
[Stepfanie] wanted to do it is if we did it correctly and did it with
style and did it with a contemporary look."</TE>
<TE>   "Hunter: Return to Justice" can be seen Saturday at 9 p.m. on NBC.
The network has rated it TV-14 (may be unsuitable for children
younger than 14).</TE>

<HD>Gentry Is Concerned About Poor Choices</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The Clippers have committed 23 turnovers in each of their last two
games and have lost both games to grateful opponents eager to
capitalize on their mistakes. The Clippers have averaged 18.4
turnovers in five games to start the season after averaging 14.8 in
2001-02.</LD>
<LD>   "We've got to make better decisions," Coach Alvin Gentry said
Saturday. "We've got to be smarter. Our effort has been fine. We play
a team like New Jersey [Friday] and we're up by eight or nine points
and we turned the ball over three straight possessions and they
scored on three straight possessions.</LD>
<LD>   "Our effort has been great. I've got no complaints about our
effort, but we have got to play smarter."</LD>
<TE>   The Nets scored 29 points off Clipper turnovers en route to a
106-92 victory Friday. The Philadelphia 76ers turned the Clippers'
turnovers into 28 points en route to a 101-99 overtime victory
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We get three or four traveling calls every game and charging
calls, too," point guard Andre Miller said after committing seven
turnovers Friday. "We're forcing the issue too much. We're trying too
hard to make plays and get to the basket."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gentry also said he would like to see the Clippers keep going
inside to forward Elton Brand and center Michael Olowokandi. The
Clippers went away from them late in Friday's game. Brand had 20
points, but only four points and two shots in the fourth quarter.
Olowokandi had 18 points, but only two points and two shots in the
fourth.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to have a pecking order," Gentry said. "The pecking
order has to be to throw the ball inside until we can't do it
anymore. Elton and Michael are playing great basketball. Some of our
guys have to be accepting of their roles on the team. They might not
get the shots. We've got to establish a pecking order on this team."</TE>

<TE>   Update -- Having unsuccessfully chased Philadelphia's Allen
Iverson (34 points) and New Jersey's Jason Kidd (35) in their last
two games, the Clippers get a look at Orlando's Tracy McGrady, who is
every bit as difficult to stop. McGrady is averaging 30.7 points. He
had 47 in the Magic's loss to the Clippers last season at Staples
Center. The Magic has defeated the Clippers in four consecutive games
at Orlando. Quentin Richardson is expected to play today despite
suffering from a hyperextended right knee and a cut on his left
eyelid.</TE>

<HD>NHRA Is Still Waiting for Sun</HD>
<DH>Drag racing at Pomona is rained out again, but officials
hope to complete program today, in time for Monday's awards banquet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Shav Glick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Another day of steady rain forced the National Hot Rod Assn. to
cancel Saturday's Auto Club Finals drag racing program at Pomona
Raceway and gamble on a sunny -- or at least dry -- day today.</LD>
<LD>   "The forecast is for clear skies," said Graham Light, NHRA vice
president of operations. "If it comes true, we will run our
professional classes and finish in time to hand out the season awards
at Monday night's banquet.</LD>
<LD>   "If it continues to rain, we will pull the plug on everything and
reschedule three days of racing next weekend, starting Friday."</LD>
<TE>   The Budweiser Shootout, a bonus event for top fuel drivers
scheduled for Saturday, will be held during February's
Winternationals, as it was two years ago because of similar weather
conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Kenny Bernstein, seeded No. 1 for the Shootout, is retiring after
today's finals, but his son, Brandon, received permission to drive
the Budweiser King in his place.</TE>
<TE>   "Two years ago, when we had a similar situation with Joe Amato
retiring between now and the Winternationals, we let his new driver,
Darrell Russell, compete," Light said.</TE>
<TE>   Russell reached the finals, where he lost to Gary Scelzi.</TE>
<TE>   "If any of the other drivers are not competing next February,
their spot will go to the next qualifying driver in this year's
standings," Light said.</TE>
<TE>   That would be Rhoda Hartman-Smith or John Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Because only one qualifying round was completed this week, the
fields will include Thursday's fastest 16, with the provision that
any driver in the top 10 in the season standings will be seeded into
the eliminations.</TE>
<TE>   This moved Andrew Cowin into the No. 16 top fuel berth,
eliminating Clay Millican. Cowin, who drives the Yankee car for
Darrell Gwynn, will meet No. 1 qualifier Russell in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   This is the first time Russell has been low qualifier.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a bit of a lucky break for us," he said. "I know there are
plenty of cars here that probably could have run quicker than that
given the opportunity. At the same time, there's no reason to think
we couldn't have stepped it up a bit also."</TE>
<TE>   Russell qualified in 4.571 seconds at 313.22 mph Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The funny car seedings will prevent Tony Pedregon from facing his
boss, 11-time champion John Force, in an early round. Force, with a
31-point lead over Pedregon, his Castrol Mustang teammate, after 22
events, can clinch his 12th title by reaching the semifinals, even if
Pedregon wins the event.</TE>
<TE>   If both win their first- and second-round matches, the two will
meet in an anti-climactic semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   If Force falters against Scotty Cannon or the Cory Lee-Terry
Haddock first-round winner, Pedregon could win the $400,000 bonus if
he wins the finals. Cannon is one of the drivers seeded into the
eliminations.</TE>
<TE>   Tommy Johnson Jr. was the other funny car driver added to the 16.
Forced out were Stephen Neese and Bob Gilbertson.</TE>
<TE>   In pro stock, George Marnell, who won the Winternationals here
last February, was seeded into the finals along with Mark Whisnant
and Allen Johnson. Steve Johnson was the only nonqualified pro stock
bike rider to move up.</TE>
<TE>   Sportsman cars are scheduled to begin eliminations at 9:30 a.m.
today, with the professionals taking over at 11. The pro classes are
expected to finish around 4 p.m., with sportsmen continuing to race
until 7:30 and probably finishing Monday morning.</TE>
<TE>   "Our objective is to get everything over in time for the awards
banquets," said Light.</TE>
<TE>   The NHRA Powerade ceremony at the Kodak Theater in Hollywood will
begin at 6:30 p.m. The Lucas awards show for sportsman classes will
be held at 4 p.m.</TE>

<HD>Softly on the Right Track With Churchill Downs Win</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Of the nine fillies and mares entered in Saturday's $223,600
Churchill Downs Distaff Handicap, only two had won a race before in
Louisville -- longshots Softly and Lotta Rhythm.</LD>
<LD>   After the Grade II was history, the same held true.</LD>
<LD>   Softly, a 23-1 shot, rallied late under jockey Jon Court and beat
California shipper Bare Necessities by a neck in 1:35 for the mile.</LD>
<TE>   Owned by James Tafel and trained by Carl Nafzger, the 4-year-old
Binalong filly won for the sixth time in 13 starts and is two for
three at Churchill Downs. She had won an optional claimer locally
under the same jockey May 16.</TE>
<TE>   "Truthfully, she had never lived up to expectations until
recently," said Nafzger, who also won the final race on the Churchill
Downs card with 5-1 shot Proud Partner. "But, after she closed so
well to win at Arlington Park [the Sweetest Chant on Oct. 14], I
thought, 'Hey, the Distaff's run on our home track. Let's take a
shot.' "</TE>
<TE>   Bare Necessities, who had won three of seven in California for
trainer Wally Dollase, wound up 2 1/2 lengths clear of Victory Ride.
Trip, the 19-10 favorite, was seventh and Habibti finished eighth for
trainer Bob Baffert. She is winless in five races since taking last
year's Hollywood Starlet.</TE>
<TE>   "I just followed the instructions Carl gave me," Court said. "I
let the speed duel itself out [through 22 2/5, 44 2/5 and 1:09 1/5
fractions]. They were winging at the start and we were winging at the
end."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Taking advantage of a dream trip, 8-5 favorite Babae won the
$116,700 Athenia Handicap at Aqueduct.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden by Jorge Chavez for owner Joseph Platt Jr. and trainer
Frank Alexander, the 6-year-old Barkerville mare beat 4-1 second
choice Strawberry Blonde by three-quarters of a length. She completed
the 1 1/16 miles over a yielding turf course in 1:44 4/5.</TE>
<TE>   This was the 14th win in 39 starts for the Chilean-bred mare.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a really good mare," Alexander said. "She never runs a bad
race. I was looking at her record the other day and, even in the
Diana, she only got beat by a length when she was fourth at a
distance she doesn't like against some of the best fillies and mares
in the country.</TE>
<TE>   "Jorge knows her very well and when he gets to the front on her,
she's very game. She doesn't let anything go past her."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sentimental Value made a successful main track debut, winning the
$125,000 Matiara Stakes over a sloppy surface at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Trained by Kristin Mulhall for the Thoroughbred Corp., which is
managed by her father Richard, Sentimental Value followed up her win
in last month's Harold C. Ramser Sr. Handicap on the Santa Anita turf
with a four-length win over Secret Garden and four other 3-year-old
fillies.</TE>
<TE>   This was the fourth win in 11 starts for the daughter of Diesis.
Ridden by Victor Espinoza, she completed the 1 1/8 miles in 1:52.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a great filly," said Kristin Mulhall, 20. "She tries really
hard all the time. She goes all out whenever you ask her. I didn't
put [mud] stickers on her and I was a little worried that she was
going to slide around. Victor said she did a little bit, but she ran
huge."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Even though favored Metatron was unplaced in the $60,000-added
Albany Handicap at Golden Gate Fields, trainer Jerry Hollendorfer
still was able to win the sprint with Halo Cat.</TE>
<TE>   Making his first start in California, the 4-year-old Southern Halo
gelding took charge in the stretch under jockey Francisco Duran and
went on to beat 20-1 shot San Nicolas and six others in 1:09 2/5 for
the six furlongs.</TE>

<HD>Canyon's DeLong Denies Allegations of Recruiting</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dave DeLong, the co-coach of the Canyon Country Canyon cross-country
program, says he is innocent of all the recruiting allegations
brought against him in a letter sent to school Principal Bob Messina.</LD>
<LD>   DeLong, who is in his 16th year at Canyon, said Messina received a
letter Tuesday accusing Canyon's coaches and parents of some team
members of recruiting middle-school runners from outside the school's
attendance area.</LD>
<LD>   The letter was signed by cross-country and track coaches from
Newhall Hart, Saugus and Valencia, the other three schools in the
Santa Clarita Valley and members of the Foothill League along with
Canyon, Burbank and Burbank Burroughs.</LD>
<TE>   DeLong said he, two other Canyon coaches and most of the coaches
who signed the letter had a meeting at Hart on Friday. He would not
comment on the specifics of what was discussed, but did say he left
with the impression that, "It's all cleared up."</TE>
<TE>   Larry David, cross-country coach at Hart, would only say that the
"situation is progressing" and is "in the hands of the [schools']
principals."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the letter centered on the alleged influence that Canyon
coaches and some parents of runners in the Santa Clarita Warriors
youth cross-country and track programs have had in getting
middle-school runners from outside Canyon's attendance district to
attend the school.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't done anything wrong," said DeLong, who helped Canyon
win the state Division I boys' title last year and earn a No. 2
national ranking. "I wasn't surprised when I got this letter because
there had been rumors that some of the [other] coaches were very
upset ... but in terms of what it said, basically every statement was
false."</TE>
<TE>   Canyon won its eighth consecutive girls' title and fourth
consecutive boys' championship in the league finals at Lake Castaic
on Thursday.</TE>

<TE>   North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake handed Newport Harbor its first
loss of the season when Katie Wong made the only penalty stroke
during the Los Angeles Field Hockey Assn. high school championship
game Saturday at Pleasant View Park in Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The teams played to a scoreless tie through regulation and a
10-minute overtime. Wong's penalty stroke was the 10th taken by each
team.</TE>
<TE>   Sandhya Dhir of Harvard-Westlake (12-4-4) and Terry Garcia of
Santa Ana were selected co-most valuable players in the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Newport Harbor finishes with a 15-1-3 record.</TE>

<LD>Ashton White's return from injury provided a spark for Santa
Margarita and helped the Eagles to a 19-0 upset over Santa Ana Mater
Dei in a Serra League game played in a steady rain Saturday night at
Trabuco Hills.</LD>
<LD>   White, who had missed three games with a sore knee, carried 30
times for 77 yards and scored two touchdowns in a quagmire to help
the Eagles knock the Monarchs out of first place in the league.</LD>
<LD>   Mater Dei (7-2, 3-1), which managed just 107 yards of offense, can
still win a share of the league title with a victory over Bellflower
St. John Bosco (7-2, 4-0) on Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   Monarch miscues on punts set up two first-half scores for the
Eagles. White scored on a one-yard run late in the second quarter
after Mater Dei punter Tim Chicoine slipped and went to a knee at his
own 35 as he fielded a wide snap. Two plays later, Santa Margarita
quarterback Case Colaw ran 33 yards to the one.</TE>
<TE>   On its next possession, Mater Dei was forced to punt from its
28-yard line. Eagle Mark Restelli shot through the line, blocked
Chicoine's punt, scooped it up at the two, and dove into the end zone
to make it 13-0 with 38 seconds left in the half. Mater Dei blocked
the extra-point attempt.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Margarita (6-3, 1-3) continued to clamp down on defense.
Monarch running back Rafael Rice finished with 51 yards in 10 carries
and quarterback Jason Forcier completed one of 10 passes for 14 yards
with an interception.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Margarita, which had 162 yards of offense, capped the
scoring on White's five-yard run with 1:36 to play.</TE>

<TE>   La Puente Bishop Amat 21, L.A. Loyola 7 -- The Knights turned in a
squeaky-clean performance in the middle of a mud bath by rushing for
246 yards with only one fumble in a Serra League game at Glendale
High.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Seals rushed 17 times for 109 yards and a touchdown and
Andrew Soto had 81 yards in 17 carries for Bishop Amat (4-5, 1-3)
which kept its playoff hopes alive.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola had eight fumbles -- six on snaps to the quarterback -- and
lost two, one of which Bishop Amat returned 30 yards for a touchdown
and a 14-0 first-quarter lead.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola (6-3, 1-3) closed to within 14-7 when Bo Renaud scored from
four yards on Loyola's first possession of the second half, but Seals
ran in from 28 yards with 2:19 to play to seal the victory.</TE>
<TE>   Renaud had 113 yards in 21 carries for Loyola, which had just 121
total yards.</TE>

<DH>Matias' senior year at Carson is her first on a high school
campus</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lauren Peterson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dianne Matias knew she had found what she was looking for as soon as
she arrived at Carson High for her first day of school.</LD>
<LD>   Carson's expansive campus, typically bustling with thousands of
students making their way through a maze of locker-lined hallways,
was all new to this high school senior.</LD>
<LD>   "I just thought, 'Wow, there's a lot of kids here,' " she said. "I
didn't know what I was doing, or where I was going."</LD>
<TE>   Which, she reminded herself, was precisely the point.</TE>
<TE>   Matias, a 17-year-old tennis phenom, was enrolled in an
independent-study program through Futures High in Mission Viejo her
first three years of high school so she could concentrate on her
athletic career. She chose to spend her senior year in a
public-school setting because of her desire to experience the typical
routine of a student in preparation for college next year.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted to see what normal high school was like," she said.
"I wanted to get ready for college, and now I know I'll be prepared
for it."</TE>
<TE>   Matias began playing tennis regularly at age 8, but her parents,
George and Nancy Matias, began pointing her toward the sport long
before that.</TE>
<TE>   Dianne is named after Dyan Castillejo, who was a top player in the
Philippines, the family's native country, in 1985, the year Dianne
was born. Her two younger brothers go by their middle names, Ivan,
after Ivan Lendl, who was the top men's player in the world in 1989,
when 13-year-old Raineir was born, and Ace, "like the tennis ace," as
9-year-old Goffrey is known.</TE>
<TE>   "I pushed her because I know she can do it," said George Matias,
who was his daughter's primary coach until four years ago. "I've seen
the way she plays, how she doesn't want to miss anything, and I think
she's going to be good."</TE>
<TE>   Despite training full time and competing as an amateur in as many
lower-level professional tournaments as possible over the last three
years, the 5-foot-4 Matias doesn't have the physical strength that
her private coach, Jim Strong, believes she will need to succeed on
the professional level.</TE>
<TE>   The need to develop power to augment her precision and consistency
is one of the primary reasons Matias plans to play in college before
turning pro. She and Carson teammate Judith De Vera have made
commitments to USC.</TE>
<TE>   Going to Carson and playing tennis for the Colts (13-0, 10-0 in
Marine League play) is all part of a revised plan.</TE>
<TE>   Gone is the routine that allowed Matias to wake at 9 a.m., spend
up to 2 1/2 hours practicing in the morning, break for lunch, and
then spend another two or three hours on the court. She now sets her
alarm for 6:30 a.m., attends school until 2 p.m., and then goes to
Carson tennis practice or matches after that. Private practice time
is limited to about 1 1/2 hours a day.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't just go out there and do whatever. I have to schedule
everything now," Matias said. "It's a little bit more work because
I'm here every day. And I have to interact with more people, but
other than that, it hasn't been too much different."</TE>
<TE>   Carson Coach Gordon Emi believes playing for the Colts has eased
Matias' transition into campus life.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know what to expect from home-schooled kids, but she's
well-adjusted," Emi said. "She's quiet, but she gets along with the
other girls. She fits in, and I think tennis certainly helps with
that."</TE>
<TE>   Matias, No. 3 in Southern California rankings and No. 23
nationally in the U.S. Tennis Assn. girls' 18 division, was No. 1 in
Southern California and No. 3 nationally in the division as a
15-year-old in 2000. Her ranking, based on age-division performances,
sank as she began playing in professional tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   Carson, unbeaten the last two seasons, has won 46 consecutive
matches. Although they are seeded third behind Granada Hills and
Palisades, the Colts will be going for their third City Section team
title in a row and their fourth consecutive appearance in the finals
when the playoffs begin this week. Matias, who is 13-0 at No. 1
singles, should be among the favorites to win the City singles
championship.</TE>
<TE>   Those achievements would be welcome additions to Matias'
short-lived high school experience.</TE>
<TE>   "I just didn't want to look back and regret that I never even went
[to high school]," she said.</TE>

<KH>Eric Sondheimer</KH>
<HD>Bennett Wouldn't Compromise Standards</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Basketball practice for City Section schools begins on Tuesday, and
for the first time in 14 seasons, Al Bennett won't be guiding the
team at Lake Balboa Birmingham High.</LD>
<LD>   Publicly, he resigned in September because he needed more time for
himself.</LD>
<LD>   Privately, he has been fuming over the deteriorating standards
associated with coaching high school basketball.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel corrupted," he said. "I don't think you can be in this
sport and not be corrupted."</TE>
<TE>   Bennett, 57, has seen 11 students transfer from Birmingham to
other schools in the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the fall guy, I'm the rotten guy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett has been known as a disciplinarian. He doesn't want
players to fire off three-point shots in rapid fashion. In fact, many
of his teams were required to pass the ball several times before
taking a shot. What a concept.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge was convincing players influenced by others to
change their ways. Some refused and left. Others adapted. At all
times, Bennett insisted he cared about his players.</TE>
<TE>   "I've done my absolute best to work with kids and make them better
people and better teams," he said. "It breaks my heart to see a kid
leave my program when I know I can help them and he leaves for all
the wrong reasons."</TE>
<TE>   The school gave its full support to Bennett.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd still be our coach today if he wanted to," Athletic Director
Rick Prizant said.</TE>
<TE>   But Bennett could no longer put up with the negatives, even though
the positives of trying to help teenagers succeed remained a powerful
lure.</TE>
<TE>   He expressed frustration at "the way the game is being played and
because of the recruiting and because the way parents are and the
selfishness of the kids."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think kids are learning good values," he said. "I have
worked my butt off, and I believe if every one of those kids had
stayed, they would have been better kids for it."</TE>
<TE>   Howard Levine, the coach at Van Nuys Grant, has known Bennett for
more than 20 years. Levine, who will be starting his 17th season,
said coaching high school basketball has changed.</TE>
<TE>   "You're going against influences you have no control over," he
said. "You're going against a street-ball mentality that is ruining
the game at all levels. You talk to college guys and pro guys and
they say the same, 'The game isn't as good as it once was.'</TE>
<TE>   "You go with the flow and bend a little bit. You still have
ballplayers playing as a team, willing to play defense. You bend a
little bit for individuals with off-the-court actions. You have to
take each individual by themselves because they're leading different
lives away from the basketball court."</TE>
<TE>   One former Birmingham player called Bennett "a great defensive
coach," but he complained that Bennett didn't help him or others get
a college scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   And that's a big problem for coaches today. Many of their players
think they're talented enough to play for a big-time college and
can't accept the fact they might be good high school players, but
nothing more.</TE>
<TE>   Tell players the truth and sometimes it's sayonara. They'll find
another coach who believes in them or tells them what they want to
hear.</TE>
<TE>   Every coach wants to help players realize their dreams, not take
them away.</TE>
<TE>   Every coach wants to help players become better. The question is
how far should a coach go to make it happen?</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas Hauselman, a former Birmingham assistant, expressed
dismay at Bennett's departure.</TE>
<TE>   "More attention should be paid to the coaches that have given of
themselves in the pursuit of educating young men to become good
people first, good basketball players second," Hauselman said.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the coaches that should be celebrated, respected and
praised. These are also the coaches who are becoming extinct in favor
of a new breed of coaches hellbent on sacrificing ethics for wins."</TE>
<TE>   There are plenty of ethical coaches who have no plans to quit.
They intend to stick with their principles and values in an effort to
make sure their players are better for it.</TE>

<LD>Given the fact Steinlen was a stakes winner on the turf, it seems
strange that today's $70,000 feature at Hollywood Park named in his
honor is being run on the main track.</LD>
<LD>   The recent wet weather moved the Steinlen -- and all other races
originally scheduled for the turf through Monday -- to the dirt,
meaning Reba's Gold is the horse to beat in the 1 1/16-mile affair.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Alex Trebek's Creston Farm and trained by Dan Hendricks,
Reba's Gold, a 5-year-old Slew O'Gold horse, is dropping in class
after finishing third in last month's Goodwood Breeders' Cup Handicap
at Santa Anita.</LD>
<TE>   After setting a rapid pace, Reba's Gold weakened to be beaten by a
little more than three lengths by winner Pleasantly Perfect and a
nose by runner-up Momentum. His competition isn't as stiff today; his
main rivals include a 6-year-old who has been idle for almost six
months and another gelding who is 0 for 10 in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Freedom Crest will make his first appearance since finishing sixth
in the Lone Star Park Handicap in May, but the son of To Freedom has
won three of six at Hollywood Park and has some solid drills on his
tab for trainer Richard Baltas.</TE>
<TE>   Futural, who hasn't won in about 1 1/2 years, returns to Hollywood
Park for the first time since he was claimed for $80,000 earlier in
the year. The best he has been able to do in five races for his new
connections is a pair of seconds at Hastings Park in Vancouver.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Pohave, who improved a lot when sent long by
trainer Eduardo Inda, will try for a repeat in today's fourth at
Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Rene Amescua. The underrated trainer won with 11 of his
41 starters at the recently concluded Bay Meadows meet.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Jeff Odintz. The New York-based trainer is seven for
137 in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using Alert and Ready 'N Gone in
the sixth, Scoop Of Ice and Unrelenting Grit in the seventh, Freedom
Crest and Reba's Gold in the eighth and Lapidus, Lake Ray and
Snowballs Chance in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/7. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $9.40/$33.60. Total money bet: $66.</TE>

<KH>LAKER REPORT</KH>
<HD>O'Neal Might Not Be Ready by Tuesday</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By the end of three road games in four nights, Shaquille O'Neal was
expressing doubt about playing Tuesday night against the Atlanta
Hawks, so a 2-5 record might not be the worst of it yet for the
Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   The plan is to have O'Neal practice today and Monday, attend a
shoot-around Tuesday, and then he will tell everyone about the toe
that so delays the defense of the Lakers' three consecutive NBA
titles.</LD>
<LD>   In the meantime, he is alternately optimistic and pessimistic,
depending on the fit of his shoe and the feel beneath his toe, which
has been the most recent issue. O'Neal's recoveries tend to follow
circuitous paths, and there's still the matter of getting the
orthotic devices exactly right, though a week ago he said they were
perfect.</LD>
<TE>   While the Lakers understand they aren't the Lakers without O'Neal,
they're noting the names and addresses of their detractors, whom they
view as a bit too eager to find fault with a team that any day now
will be playing for its fourth consecutive championship. Opponents,
they feel, celebrate too hard. Television analysts, the ones they
watched in five-star hotel rooms for going on a week, were too quick
to bury them.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's talking trash now," Tracy Murray said. "When we get
our team back intact, they won't be talking then."</TE>
<TE>   Ten days ago, O'Neal scolded Hall of Famer Bill Walton for
something Walton had said on television, and in Washington on Friday,
O'Neal took Sean Elliott to task for what was apparently the same
transgression. According to friends of Elliott's at ESPN, O'Neal
first left Elliott a warning note at the hotel the team shared with
some from the cable network, then pulled him aside before the game at
MCI Center and wagged a finger in his face.</TE>
<TE>   The next several days will be critical for O'Neal, along with a
few others who could use the practice time (Rick Fox) or the recovery
time (Robert Horry, Devean George).</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers did not practice Saturday after their overnight,
cross-country trip. The flight might have been particularly arduous
given the events of Friday night, their journey from 17 points back
to one up on the Washington Wizards, their defeat on a blown
defensive assignment.</TE>
<TE>   They return to the court today in El Segundo, and practice again
Monday. If O'Neal is unable to play Tuesday night, the Lakers can
test his toe again on practice days Wednesday and Thursday before
Friday night's game against Golden State. After seven games in 11
days to start the season, they play only three times in the next 10
days.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The best news for the Lakers is that the Sacramento Kings haven't
started particularly well, either, and they don't play the Kings
until Christmas. By then, everyone should be sound.</TE>
<TE>   Still, they are 2-5. Last year, the Lakers lost their fifth game
on Dec. 26, in their 25th game.</TE>
<TE>   "It is strange," Kobe Bryant said. "But it's real early in the
season. We played pretty well. We fought hard [Thursday] night to
come back. We played pretty well [Friday night] to come back and have
a chance to win the game. We'll be OK. We'll actually be a better
team because of it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ever the forgotten man, Brian Shaw averaged 12 points on the
three-game trip.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Jackson turned to Shaw after the Lakers scored an L.A.
franchise-low 70 points Tuesday in Cleveland. Shaw scored 10 points
Thursday against Boston and 20 points Friday against the Wizards, 16
in a 39-point Laker fourth quarter. In the final two games of the
trip, Shaw was 13 for 20 from the floor.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jackson often speaks of winning quarters rather than winning
games, thus allowing his players a narrower perspective on a large
task. The Lakers played 13 periods (including a five-minute overtime)
in their three-game losing streak and lost 11 of them.</TE>

<HD>Pep Talk Sparks Bulls' Williams</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An hour before Saturday night's game, Chicago Bull Coach Bill
Cartwright called Jay Williams into his office and shut the door.</LD>
<LD>   His rookie point guard had been struggling, worrying so much about
creating shots for everyone else that he was forgetting the game that
got him to the NBA.</LD>
<LD>   "He said, 'I just want you to play,' " Williams said.</LD>
<TE>   He definitely got the message. In his best NBA game yet, the No. 2
pick of the draft had a triple-double and made a three-point basket
with 34 seconds left to seal the Bulls' 100-93 victory over the New
Jersey Nets at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "Lately it was hard. I was trying to be the team orchestrator,"
said Williams, who got the game ball. "[The talk] kind of took a big
burden off my chest. I just went out and played."</TE>
<TE>   He finished with 26 points, 13 assists and 14 rebounds, Chicago's
first triple-double since Michael Jordan had one in April 1997. Jalen
Rose scored 26 points for the Bulls, who ended a four-game losing
streak.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Kidd scored 15 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter, but
it wasn't enough for the Eastern Conference defending champions, who
lost for only the second time. Kidd also had a triple-double with 12
assists and 11 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "It's early in the season and we are still trying to find our
identity," Kidd said. "We haven't played a great game yet."</TE>
<TE>   But Kidd did his best to keep New Jersey in it. After trailing by
as many as 12 points in the fourth quarter, he made two sets of free
throws to pull New Jersey within 95-91 with 56 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 114, Detroit 75 -- Michael Finley had 25 points, and Steve
Nash had 17 points and 10 assists at Dallas to help the Mavericks
improve to 6-0, the best start in franchise history.</TE>
<TE>   Eduardo Najera scored 16 points for the Mavericks, the league's
only unbeaten team.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Hamilton's 19 points and Clifford Robinson's 13 led the
Pistons (5-2), who had been off to their best start since 1996-97.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas Coach Don Nelson's emphasis on improving the team's defense
has been producing results. The Pistons shot only 36% (26 for 73)
from the field.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Portland 95, San Antonio 76 -- Reserve Bonzi Wells scored 19
points and Rasheed Wallace overcame early foul trouble to finish with
18 points, and the Trail Blazers handed the Spurs their first loss in
the new SBC Center.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Duncan led the Spurs with 16 points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boston 105, Minnesota 99 -- Antoine Walker made nine three-point
baskets and scored 31 points at Minneapolis, and the Celtics won
their fourth game in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Walker made nine of 13 three-point shots. The Celtics made 14
three-pointers, the most in the league this season.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota's Kevin Garnett had 24 points and 11 rebounds for his
seventh double-double in as many games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Washington 93, Cleveland 79 -- Jerry Stackhouse scored 27 points
and Michael Jordan had eight of his 12 points in the fourth quarter
at Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan had eight rebounds and six assists. He played a season-high
31 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 84, Miami 82 -- Rashard Lewis had 24 points, 10 rebounds
and three blocks for Seattle, and Gary Payton scored 20 points,
including a key three-pointer late in the fourth quarter at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Jones scored 23 points for the Heat, but in the last five
seconds he had a potential game-tying shot blocked by Desmond Mason.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 108, Toronto 84 -- Brad Miller scored 23 points at
Indianapolis, and the Pacers outscored the Raptors by 37 points in
the second half.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacers improved to 5-1, their best start after six NBA games
since joining the league for the 1976-77 season. Indiana started four
of its first five ABA seasons with a mark of at least 5-1.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 110, Philadelphia 105 -- Tim Thomas scored 21 points,
including five in overtime, and Ray Allen had 20 points at Milwaukee,
ending the 76ers' four-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Allen Iverson led the 76ers with 31 points on 11-for-27 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Denver 84, Memphis 73 -- Rodney White scored 18 of his career-high
22 points in the second quarter for the Nuggets at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Memphis, which opened last season with eight consecutive losses,
dropped to 0-7 to remain the league's only team without a victory.
Pau Gasol led the Grizzlies with 21 points.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dear Donald,</TE>
<TE>   I have seen the future. Unfortunately, it looks exactly like the
past.</TE>
<TE>   Not that it comes as a surprise, after 22 farce-filled seasons,
but this would be your all-timer. If you mess this one up, it will
stand as your monument.</TE>
<TE>   Even I didn't think you could miss this time, with these young
players who vowed to start a new Clipper tradition, turned a
laughingstock into a hot property, ran attendance up to 18,000 a
game, and, according to sources, might have made you as much as $12
million in profits last season.</TE>
<TE>   Not that you did anything to deserve it. The gods dropped these
guys in your lap, although the way it's heading, it's obvious now it
was another of their cosmic jokes.</TE>
<TE>   The young Clippers were not just good but spectacular. People
everywhere loved them, not only here. Sales of your apparel, which
once piled up in warehouses and had to be given away to quilt makers,
rocketed into the NBA's top 10.</TE>
<TE>   Lamar Odom and Darius Miles jerseys were among the top 10
individual sellers. D and Q -- for those over 30, that's Miles and
Quentin Richardson -- starred in their own Spike Lee-directed Nike
spot. Kids copied their forehead-fist thing.</TE>
<TE>   This wasn't mere show, though, but the real deal. Young and
exuberant as they were, the young Clippers were remarkably
levelheaded, with the notable exception of Odom.</TE>
<TE>   More to the point, in a first for Clipperdom, they loved it here.
They loved playing as teammates, even if, like Q and Corey Maggette,
they vied with each other for minutes. Almost to a man, they said
they'd take less money to stay.</TE>
<TE>   To this point, you hadn't had to do anything, which is, of course,
why things proceeded so smoothly for three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   The young players were all on rookie-scale contracts that tied
them up for five years -- three guaranteed, the fourth at the team's
option, the fifth as restricted free agents with the team holding the
right of first refusal.</TE>
<TE>   Finally this summer came your turn. Michael Olowokandi, a
four-year man, was a restricted free agent. Elton Brand, a three-year
man, was eligible for a long-term extension.</TE>
<TE>   Odom, Maggette and Andre Miller were all three-year men too, even
if no one had illusions that you'd even talk to any of them.</TE>
<TE>   Odom had things to prove. Maggette was a rare athlete and a demon
worker but would just have to wait his turn.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, however, was another hard-nosed leader, your point guard
of the future and you had just given up Miles to get him. That would
have made him a priority anywhere else. Of course, this isn't
anywhere else, or anywhere at all.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations went nowhere, as they usually do in Clipperdom, even
with the players seeking sub-maximum deals.</TE>
<TE>   Even your ultra-loyalists in the front office concede that
Olowokandi asked for $85 million, $10 million under the maximum, and
Brand for $75 million, less than the $80 million that players chosen
below him in the '99 draft -- Houston's Steve Francis and Phoenix's
Shawn Marion -- got.</TE>
<TE>   It wouldn't even have blown your budget.</TE>
<TE>   Giving Olowokandi $85 million would have meant bumping him only
from his current $6 million to $9 million. Brand's extension wouldn't
kick in for a year so you could have signed them, traded your No. 1
picks -- who won't play for a while in any case -- and had a
$42-million payroll, $600,000 lower than your present payroll.</TE>
<TE>   One might argue the wisdom of signing Olowokandi, who developed
slowly and still has problems with consistency, although this
season's numbers -- 16 points, 13 rebounds, 3.3 blocks a game --
suggest he's still coming fast.</TE>
<TE>   However, the only question about Brand is: Do you want to just
sign him or adopt him too?</TE>
<TE>   If Olowokandi is a growth stock with a big upside, Brand is like
one of those bonds they sold in the early '80s that paid 15%. You
bought it for $2,000, put it in your IRA, came back in 10 years and
it was $8,000.</TE>
<TE>   Brand delivers 20/10 a night and as intangibles go, he's the
mother lode. Invariably positive, he practices hard and comes ready
to play. His high school coach in Peekskill, N.Y., noted that in
three of Elton's four years, the entire team had a 90% scholastic
average, which hadn't ever happened before or since.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, your preferred alternative, to wait until the last
moment, or for someone else to set the price -- remember when you
gave Tyrone Nesby, of all people, $9 million, because the Spurs
offered that? -- sent a message to your players:</TE>
<TE>   If I wouldn't sign anyone, not even Elton, what makes you think
YOU have a future here?</TE>
<TE>   I know you don't understand this, but young players are
preoccupied with their futures and need a signal. Unfortunately, they
didn't like the one they got.</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, the atmosphere around the Clippers is gloomy, going
on funereal. People say what they are obliged to on the record, but
there's no escaping the reality. As one official said, "He killed the
team." Meaning you.</TE>
<TE>   Having seen this before, I know you will spend the season
insisting that you'll sign both players next summer. It's possible
but it's a longer shot than it was this summer, when you didn't have
to bid against anyone else. Business turns personal and there's no
business like Clipper business.</TE>
<TE>   On one hand, you have talented young men who can go on whim,
because they're rich and there's no question of whether they'll get
richer, only from whom they'll choose to accept the money.</TE>
<TE>   And on the other hand, there's you.</TE>
<TE>   Actually I blame myself (note to readers: not really but play
along): All these years, I should have been putting it into the only
terms you could understand.</TE>
<TE>   It's as if you woke up one day and, instead of having $500 million
worth of buildings along the Wilshire Corridor, you found that you
owned all of Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   And then, instead of holding a party that lasted the rest of your
life, you said: "Wait a second, let's not pay the mortgages and see
if the banks foreclose!"</TE>
<TE>   Remember Danny Manning?</TE>
<TE>   Swore to leave from the day he arrived. Walked into the office
with his agent at high noon, July 1, 1993, the moment his original
deal was up, to sign a one-year qualifying offer, which would make
him a free agent upon expiration.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, you knocked down Elgin Baylor's trade, sending him to
Miami for Glen Rice and, despite mounting evidence, continued to
insist in your inimitable style that Manning would stay ("Mark, what
can we do to keep Danny?").</TE>
<TE>   At midseason Baylor finally persuaded you to move Manning.
Unfortunately, the deal you picked was for Atlanta's Dominique
Wilkins, another impending free agent, whom you let walk away that
summer.</TE>
<TE>   We're back into that twilight time, when everyone can see what
lies ahead, except you, even if it takes years to unravel.</TE>
<TE>   Brand, Miller, Maggette and Odom can be locked up through next
season, Q and Keyon Dooling through the 2004-05 season, so their
bodies will be here.</TE>
<TE>   However, without belief, the one thing they need from you, this
thing won't fly. You think their bad start this season is about
injuries?</TE>
<TE>   Try, instead, depression.</TE>
<TE>   Not that this will make any impression at this late date, but
people will really be unhappy with you this time, because they love
this team. This is a breach of faith across the board, with your
players, coaches, fans, employees, broadcast partners and
advertisers.</TE>
<TE>   This is genius, upside down. You won't make the commitments that
your competitors make and you are reviled but you won't sell, or
move, or learn from your mistakes, or listen to advice, or bow to any
pressure, be it from David Stern himself.</TE>
<TE>   It's too bad you got it completely wrong because one thing I'll
give you, you'll never back away from doing it your way.</TE>
<TE>   This is your defining moment ... and the word that's emerging,
finally, is "hopeless." They should run your picture alongside it in
the dictionary, with a little word balloon above your head that says,
"I just want to win."</TE>
<TE>   It has been fun having this team around. It just might not last
very long. Heavenly shades of night are falling on Clipperdom once
more.</TE>
<TE>   You do take the cake. Of course, then you sit on it.</TE>
<TE>   Still in awe after all these years,</TE>

<TE>   No November Reign</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers are off to another slow start, 1-4 overall and 1-3 in
November. Since the franchise moved from Buffalo to San Diego for the

for 1992-93, the last year they made the playoffs. A look:</TE>

<LD>   GAME OF THE WEEK</LD>
<TE>*--*
Rk  Team (record)       Comment (last week's position)
1   SAN ANTONIO  (4-2)  Anyone can have off night: Duncan has one
                        point in second half against Trail Blazers.
                        (3)
2   SACRAMENTO  (4-3)   Oops: World's Best Bench gets outscored in
                        New York by Lee Nailon, 20-13. (1)
3   LAKERS  (2-5)       Beats 0-7, anyway. This was only Phil's
                        next-to-next-to-worst-case scenario. (21)
4   DALLAS (6-0)        Averaging usual 107 but didn't play winning
                        team until Saturday night. (4)
5   NEW JERSEY  (5-2)   Earliest concession on record: George Karl
                        says Nets "have a walk" in East. (2)
6   ORLANDO  (5-1)      Fear ebbs as Hill, whose ankle got sore vs.
                        Bucks, gets 49 vs. Kings, SuperSonics. (17)
7   NEW ORLEANS (4-1)   So much for honeymoon: Crowds drop into
                        13,000s for third, fourth games. (8)
8   DETROIT  (5-2)      Defense was doing outstanding job until
                        running into Mavericks. (5)
9   INDIANA  (5-1)      Lost first one to new archrival Nets amid 9
                        technicals, 4 flagrants, 3 ejections. (6)
10  PHILADELPHIA (4-2)  At this point, what could it hurt? Iverson,
                        shooting 35%, sprains right thumb. (9)
11  BOSTON (4-2)        Walker breaks out of three-point slump with
                        nine against Timberwolves. (22)
12  MINNESOTA  (4-3)    With Brandon, Szczerbiak out, ex-Clipper
                        Hudson kept them going, averaging 18. (7)
13  UTAH (2-4)          Even Mailmen get flu: Malone hits Hawks with
                        27-11-7 to celebrate return. (14)
14  SEATTLE (5-2)       Payton mad he didn't get new deal. Anderson
                        wants out of old one. (10)
15  PHOENIX  (3-3)      Celtics' No. 1 pick Joe Johnson just failed
                        audition as starter with second team. (13)
16  HOUSTON  (3-2)      Cuttino (Upwardly) Mobley: Averaged 10 as a
                        rookie, then 16, 20, 22, now at 23. (15)
17  ATLANTA  (3-3)      Big Dog (25 a game) joins new big three with
                        Jason Terry (22), Shareef (17). (19)
18  CLIPPERS (1-4)      Don Casey, who put in zone for Gentry, could
                        tell him about Donald too. (24)
19  PORTLAND (3-4)      Imagine that: Sub point guards Daniels,
                        McInnis get into a fight on bench. (11)
20  WASHINGTON  (4-3)   Collins has to figure out how to turn
                        Stackhouse into MJ and MJ into Scottie. (12)
21  MILWAUKEE (3-3)     Insider: Karl lost them even faster than he
                        lost U.S. team in summer. (18)
22  TORONTO  (2-4)      Let's just say Vince hasn't shown 'em yet:
                        averaged 13 for three, got hurt. (16)
23  CHICAGO  (3-4)      Chandler, Curry start, average 15-10.
                        Unfortunately, that's combined. (20)
24  CLEVELAND  (2-5)    Wagner due back soon but figures to struggle,
                        as most of rookies are. (23)
25  NEW YORK (1-5)      Sprewell due back soon, so things will get
                        better. Well, a little better. (28)
26  MIAMI  (1-4)        Riley, who had Kareem in post, then Ewing and
                        Mourning, now has Malik Allen. (25)
27  GOLDEN STATE (1-6)  So much for honeymoon: Musselman's bunch
                        upset Spurs in debut, lost rest. (27)
28  DENVER  (2-4)       Nuggets score 63 as Barkley asks what they're
                        doing on TNT. (29)
29  MEMPHIS (0-7)       West says Lowe's safe -- after Grizzlies go
                        0-4 and he has coach in for meeting. (26)</TE>

<HD>Rockets Honor Olajuwon, Then Put Away Warriors</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Losing on a night when Hakeem Olajuwon's uniform number was retired
would have been unacceptable.</LD>
<LD>   "I didn't even think about losing. It would have been a disgrace,"
Steve Francis said after scoring 23 of his 31 points in the second
half, including six in the final 1:02, to lead the Houston Rockets
over the Golden State Warriors, 111-104, Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   Olajuwon had his No. 34 jersey retired in a halftime ceremony.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a very emotional night. It almost looked unbelievable to
see him standing there," Francis continued. "I am happy I was able to
be a part of it. It is something that I will always remember."</TE>
<TE>   Olajuwon, who came to the United States from Nigeria as a gangly
7-foot teenager, played at the University of Houston before
developing into a 12-time NBA All-Star and the league's most valuable
player in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Olajuwon, 39, played 17 seasons with the Rockets, leading them to
consecutive championships in 1994 and 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Dubbed "the Dream" early in his career, Olajuwon finished as the
NBA leader in blocked shots with 3,830. He averaged 21.8 points and
11.1 rebounds, and had 2,162 steals. His production dropped to 7.1
points and six rebounds last season in 61 games with the Toronto
Raptors.</TE>
<TE>   Rocket owner Les Alexander announced that a life-sized statue of
Olajuwon would be on display at the Rockets' downtown arena that will
open next season. The crowd started chanting "MVP, MVP" as Olajuwon
spoke.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't look at this as the end, it is the beginning of the next
phase of my life," Olajuwon said. "You know what you accomplished
over the years and now it is time to sit and watch."</TE>
<TE>   Olajuwon watched as Francis scored 30 points or more for the third
time in five games. Cuttino Mobley had 25 points.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Richardson and Gilbert Arenas each scored 28 points for
Golden State.</TE>

<HD>Mayor Should Put City First</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Laguna Beach's mayor is in very hot water over a politically
thoughtless action, having been indicted for a business role that
smacks more of pigheadedness and small-town thinking than of criminal
intent.</LD>
<LD>   When the city paid $1.8 million for two parcels near downtown
early in 2001, the site of a planned senior center, Wayne Baglin
acted as the real estate agent representing the sellers. Baglin, a
councilman at the time of the deal but now the Laguna Beach mayor,
made $36,000 in commissions, his lawyer says.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County Grand Jury indicted Baglin for conflict of
interest under the California Government Code section that says,
"City officials or employees shall not be financially interested in
any contract made by them in their official capacity, or by any body
or board of which they are members."</LD>
<TE>   In fairness, Baglin's conflict of interest on this deal wasn't in
the same ballpark as that of Dave Garofalo, the former Huntington
Beach councilman who repeatedly voted on issues involving companies
that had bought advertising from his publishing business. Garofalo
was fined, sentenced to community service and banned from public
service.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Baglin, a longtime friend of the sellers, properly
disclosed his role and abstained from voting on the sale.</TE>
<TE>   The abstention takes care of the first part--he didn't act in his
official capacity on the council because he didn't vote. But he still
was a member of the council. He knew he would face legal questions on
this issue. The city attorney drew him aside for a discussion of the
matter. Yet Baglin went ahead.</TE>
<TE>   On top of that, his lawyer rashly asserts that Baglin could have
sought a commission from the city as well as the buyers. If Baglin's
lawyer cannot see the problem with that advice, the mayor might need
new legal counsel.</TE>
<TE>   Although public officials would have a hard time avoiding all
potential conflicts of interest, this isn't a case of a councilman
owning stock in a company that happened to have business before the
council. Baglin's attorney points out that the mayor is allowed to
make a living by selling real estate, as he has for years. But if
Baglin cannot find sellers and buyers to represent without thrusting
himself into a moneymaking role on a major city deal, perhaps he
should rethink whether public service is right for him.</TE>
<TE>   Council members by definition have extraordinary contacts within
the city. Whether they abstain from votes or not, their City Hall
connections can gain them favorable business advantages.</TE>
<TE>   It's also unseemly for council members to be in a business
position where their success--such as a higher price for the
property--means the taxpayers must shell out that much more money.</TE>
<TE>   At worst, Baglin may have committed a felony, as prosecutors
accuse him of doing. At best, he committed a foolish political act
that calls into question his ability to lead.</TE>
<TE>   For all its small size, Laguna Beach continually grapples with
such major issues as coastal preservation and sewage spills. It needs
smart leaders who put its interests first, all the time.</TE>

<LD>No slowpoke in the political arena, Todd Spitzer quickly learned what
leadership in the Legislature is all about.</LD>
<LD>   "Money is a significant factor in whether people interact with you
and take you seriously," the assemblyman-elect told Times reporter
Jean O. Pasco before the Nov. 5 election.</LD>
<LD>   He was talking about Sacramento, where the Orange County
supervisor will be doing most of his business now.</LD>
<TE>   Spitzer, the Republican candidate in an overwhelmingly GOP
district, raised a $662,000 war chest -- 662 times what his
Democratic opponent accumulated.</TE>
<TE>   More power to Spitzer. And power is exactly what all this money is
about. Spitzer didn't need all that cash to win.</TE>
<TE>   But taking office with lots of money and a proven ability to raise
more helps newcomers gain leadership positions in the Capitol -- as
long as they're willing to spread the money around to other
candidates.</TE>
<TE>   That's especially true in this era of term limits. Once
legislators waited to gain the experience and seniority that brought
plum assignments. Now they don't have those years in public office,
and feel pushed to make a mark more quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer didn't create this power structure, and it's hard to blame
him for taking advantage of it. It's to his benefit, and probably
Orange County's as well, for him to start out with legislative clout.</TE>
<TE>   The system, though, bears an unsavory resemblance to
sausage-making. Sacramento needs a better way to delegate
decision-making powers.</TE>
<TE>   Now that Spitzer has gained his seat -- with 73% of the vote in a
district where he's likely to hang on with a minimum of future
campaigning -- it's time for him to set aside issues of campaign
coffers and focus on the primary task: good government and good
leadership, qualities that too often seem in short supply in
Sacramento. The last thing a new legislator should aim for is to
follow Gov. Gray Davis' path of shamelessly perpetual fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   The 40-year-old freshman assemblyman is by no means lacking in
leadership qualities. He speaks his mind. He has been willing to take
unpopular positions. And he clearly learns quickly how the system
works.</TE>
<TE>   On the less flattering side, he has shown a willingness to twist
government around to achieve narrow political aims. Earlier this
year, he successfully pushed for a charter amendment to keep Davis, a
Democrat, from filling the Republican's supervisor seat.</TE>
<TE>   Fund-raising is Spitzer's ticket to power. What Spitzer
accomplishes with that power will be the real measure of his success.</TE>

<LD>Re "Coffee's Bitter Harvest," Oct. 5:</LD>
<LD>   Thank you for the article about the coffee growers' situation
across the world. Having worked in corporate specialty coffee
(Starbucks and Peet's) for more than 10 years, I was glad to see your
article distinguish between the purchasing practices of these
small-time but high-profile retail chains and the practices of the
multinational, least-common-denominator coffee companies.</LD>
<LD>   Both Starbucks and Peet's still pay top dollar for the best coffee
available and have consistently tried to raise the bar in terms of
fair and generous relationships with growers around the world while
operating within a marketplace that has consistently placed
short-term gains over sustainable, equitable long-term growth.</LD>
<TE>   As to the question that some readers may have about the "cost" of
their cup at a store, they should not forget the cost of rent, the
cost of labor and, when drinking their lattes, the cost of milk and
the espresso machines.</TE>

natives or visitors using California's existing roads, please allow

<TE>   Re "Klamath River Administration May Cut Klamath's Flow Again,"
Oct. 11:</TE>
<TE>   As a second-generation owner of riverfront property on the lower
Klamath, I was appalled by your picture on page B8. In spite of
shrill warnings last year, the Bush administration irresponsibly and
arrogantly destroys 30,000 salmon, and just to make sure none
survive, allows angling. (They don't look like Indians, either.)</TE>
<TE>   They're no fools; kill off the fish, and our complaints become
irrelevant. Is their concern the small family farmer? No. The few
unabsorbed by huge, subsidized conglomerates are themselves
subsidized. In fact, vast tracts of farmland sit untilled across the
country, their small towns boarded up. The Native Americans
understand we ignore the rules of nature at our peril. We should
start to listen.</TE>

<HD>Pit Bulls Are Not Bad, Just Misused by Humans</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Pit Bulls' Bullish Rescuer," Oct. 23:</LD>
<LD>   Thank you for the responsible story on pit bulls. They are truly a
wonderful breed, with most of the bad press undeserved.</LD>
<LD>   I would like to expand on some of the information in your story.
The reason there are so many of them in pounds is not because they
are bad dogs but because of uncontrolled breeding.</LD>
<TE>   The scum that breed these dogs for illegal fighting may get only
one good fighter out of a litter and so breed and breed, either using
the pups to bait the fighters or turning them out on the streets.
This was how I obtained a pit bull. She was just a small pup
wandering the streets half-starved. There are also people who keep a
dog and never spay or neuter it, and of course the result is a large
number of mixes, again, mostly left to the streets or, when they are
lucky, dumped at the pound.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Sakach of the Humane Society of the United States shows his
ignorance in stating that these dogs cannot be rehabilitated and
adopted. Nonsense! It is only rarely that a dog cannot be saved.</TE>
<TE>   All terrier breeds can be dog-aggressive; very few are
people-aggressive. The pit bulls are even less so as the owner had to
be able to pull the dog out of the pit during a fight. My experience
is that they are silly, goofy big lunks that are into belly rubs and
tennis ball fetching.</TE>
<TE>   The level of cruelty perpetrated against this sweet, trusting
breed is unconscionable.</TE>

<HD>Governor Was Right to Veto Exit Exam Bill</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "State Ponders Delaying Exit Exams Due to Failures," Oct. 1:</LD>
<LD>   This year, the Legislature overwhelmingly approved SB 1408, a bill
that would require schools with high failure rates on the exit exams
to determine the reasons and develop specific plans to address
problems. This bill was an exercise in futility, and the governor was
right to veto it.</LD>
<LD>   Failure to pass exit exams is an example of social problems for
which local or state governments have no workable solutions.</LD>
<TE>   My guess is that the final outcome to the problem of exit-exam
failure is that the exit exams will be abolished or the passing
grades lowered to the point where some arbitrary percentage of the
students pass.</TE>
<TE>   My impression is that many of the problems we see are caused by
the large number of immigrants, both legal and illegal, and as only
the federal government can control immigration, the federal
government should reimburse state and local governments 100% of the
cost of burdens caused by immigration.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Failing Magic at Disney," Sept. 29:</LD>
<LD>   I am writing on behalf of the board of directors and staff of
Children's Hospital of Orange County. Our experience with Disney is
primarily through the Disneyland Resort, which, indeed, faces a
number of challenges presented by the overall nationwide tourism
slowdown.</LD>
<LD>   Despite these challenges, however, Disneyland has continued to
increase its involvement in the community and remains a shining
example of good corporate citizenship at a time when those examples
are all too rare.</LD>
<TE>   Walt Disney was among the concerned citizens who formed the
original CHOC Executive Council in 1959 to plan a new children's
hospital for Orange County. Since CHOC's opening in 1964, Disneyland
has honored its founder's commitment to children's health by
remaining a loyal and generous friend to the hospital and children we
serve.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Disneyland is one of CHOC's largest financial benefactors
and has contributed millions of dollars in support of Orange County
children's health care through the annual CHOC/Disneyland Resort
Community Walk. From grand gestures, such as dedicating proceeds from
opening day at Disney's California Adventure to CHOC, to personal
favors, such as designing and making new CHOCO Bear costumes for our
beloved mascot, Disneyland has been ready to help in any way since
before any of us can remember.</TE>
<TE>   This tradition of giving back to the community is Disney's true
magic, and based on CHOC's experience, that magic most certainly is
alive and well.</TE>

<TE>   We have become accustomed to the factual distortions of Barbara
Lichman and the Airport Working Group of Orange County regarding El
Toro Airport. Hard as it is to believe, Ms. Lichman recently reached
a new low in her arguments by using Sept. 11, 2001, as a pro-airport
argument. To attempt to use national security as an excuse to return
El Toro to military status and then sneak a commercial airport in at
the same time is pathetic and despicable.</TE>

W. If there had been a bigger voter turnout there, Measure W would
have gone down in flames. It was only the few South County cities who
were frightened out of their wits by misleading airport propaganda
and turned out en masse at the polls that made the difference. The
vote against Measure W was not representative of the majority of
Orange County citizens.</TE>

<LD>Re "Parents Angered by Lesbian's Talk at School," Oct. 26:</LD>
<LD>   I hope the irony of this situation is not lost on any who read the
article. We have a very intolerant society in regard to many
minorities -- homosexuals included. Those parents who complained
about a lesbian speaking at a school diversity day are promoting a
societal intolerance that is already pervasive.</LD>
<LD>   Their suggestion to leave "moral education" to parents would be
fine if they were actually educating their children. What they are
doing is presenting a biased opinion in hopes of swaying their
children's beliefs. If this degree of subjective teaching pervaded
our schools, our young academicians would be worse off than they are
now.</LD>
<TE>   Kudos to Principal Kristine Robertson for trying to teach
something more than math and English. Maybe this teaching of
tolerance will help prevent the beating and killing of people because
of their sexual orientation. Ms. Robertson, please don't apologize to
those parents: You've done nothing that warrants an apology.</TE>

<LD>Re "On the Outs Over the Inn," Oct. 21:</LD>
<LD>   I am appalled by Anne Lemen's vehemence and maliciousness in
trying to shut down the Village Inn on Balboa Island.</LD>
<LD>   She likens the quaint establishment to a wild brothel, overflowing
with noise and miscreants. It seems that nothing could be further
from the truth.</LD>
<TE>   Most nights, the music cannot be heard through the closed doors of
the inn, and on weekends, a bouncer is at the door. Even this measure
seems superfluous, as the crowd at the V.I. is usually a lighthearted
one. In fact, I would venture to bet that some of Lemen's renters
have enjoyed the inn and are happy to be in proximity to a restaurant
and bar while on vacation.</TE>
<TE>   And the preposterous business of blaming the place for her
daughter's dropping out of school? Maybe if Lemen wasn't out
videotaping people in the bushes, she could be there to parent her
daughter and possibly could have been there to help a cause that
should be closer to her heart.</TE>

<LD>Re: "Nursing Homes Are Criticized," Oct. 16:</LD>
<LD>   I'm tired of reading misleading articles about the nursing home
industry. I've been a nursing home administrator for more than 14
years and have dedicated myself to providing quality care to the
residents in my facility. It's by no means an easy field, and it
infuriates me when what I do is characterized as a "failure." This
does a disservice to our industry and motivates no one to make it
better.</LD>
<TE>   The majority of California nursing homes that failed to meet
minimum federal standards did so because of minor deficiencies that
caused no harm to residents. These deficiencies are always taken
seriously and quickly addressed by nursing home staff. Once
corrected, these facilities are put back into compliance. It's
important that the public be aware that most California nursing homes
are in full compliance with federal regulations. The public demands,
and should be guaranteed, adequate nursing home staffing. But in
order for this to happen, we must be able to provide proper training
and adequate pay. The reimbursement rates provided by entitlement
programs is woefully inadequate. To make matters worse, most
California nursing homes will receive no Medi-Cal rate increase this
year, while Medicare rates are being cut nearly $30 a day. This, on
top of the negative publicity constantly being hurled at our
industry, makes it nearly impossible to entice workers into our
field.</TE>
<TE>   Nursing home corporations are not always the bad guys. I happen to
work for a corporation that prides itself on providing quality care,
customer service and strict adherence to corporate compliance. Bad
operators and bad administrators have got to go. They stand in the
way of changing the image that has plagued our industry for years.
But let's also be mindful of the success stories. Of those people who
recover and go home and of those facilities that provide love and
compassionate care to people in the remaining years of their lives.
There is always another side of the story, and this one deserves to
be heard.</TE>

<HD>Angels in Outfield but Not Parking Lot, Stands</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I gleefully drove to Edison Field to see the Angels, only to discover
that all of the handicapped parking places had been filled up. I need
such a spot because of polio I suffered back in 1954. Post-polio
syndrome has further complicated my life, and now I walk only with
the assistance of crutches. Spaces close to the stadium existed, but
they were filled with tailgaters who didn't want to move, even when I
shared with them the story of my limitations. They told me they were
"saving" this parking place for a friend. In fact, all my words to
them got me was a vicious tongue lashing with adjectives I've
instructed my children never to use. I asked the Anaheim police for
help, but they indicated to me that there was nothing they could do,
and nothing is what they did.</LD>
<LD>   After a laborious walk to my seat to watch what I was sure would
be the greatest ballgame ever played, I discovered that I was sitting
in front of four boys (they are not yet sufficiently mature to be
called men) in their early 20s who seemed to only know the same
adjective that my "friends" in the parking lot knew. After six
innings of this language, I finally turned around and asked them to
stop swearing. Neighboring fans chimed in also, asking the boys to
find other words to express their chagrin. We were all summarily
sworn at.</LD>
<TE>   For decades, I have literally prayed for ballplayers like the
current Angels. It's a shame the day was spoiled by folks who thought
a whole lot more about themselves than any player on this Angel team
ever has.</TE>

<LD>Re "State Plans to Renovate, Rent Historic Crystal Cove Cottages,"
Oct. 16:</LD>
<LD>   Congratulations and thank you to the state parks system and
advocacy groups such as the Alliance to Save Crystal Cove for their
tireless efforts and good work. It is a win-win situation for
California's coastline, residents and tourism that the 1920s
bungalows, sheltered along the coastline below Coast Highway, will be
renovated and restored rather than replaced.</LD>
<LD>   The backdrop to these quaint, unimposing cottages was once a
rolling auburn hillside cut by canyons of lush green foliage and has
since become the grotesque development of multimillion-dollar homes.
The upscale shops and rows of white houses with tile roofs have
destroyed the once picturesque mountainside and stripped it of much
of its charm and beauty. Restoration and remodeling of the Crystal
Cove historic area will preserve the integrity of this scenic,
peaceful beach community and protect our coastline from further
desecration.</LD>
<TE>   Dee Anna S. Behle</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Planning for only 60 camp sites at Crystal Cove State Park is a
poor use of land. Rusty Areias, director of California Parks and
Recreation Department, said last fall there is a shortage of
thousands of camp sites in California. From the Crystal Cove Historic
District to the northern boundary there is room for at least 1,000
camp sites. The location is much better because that land is on the
ocean side of Coast Highway.</TE>
<TE>   Most El Morro Village residents are taxpayers and senior citizens
with no place to live in two years. No one seems to care about them,
including The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Crystal Cove State Park is now open to the public with parking for
beach use, hiking and with more than enough land for more public
parking. The Sierra Club really wants nothing but open space and
hiking trails.</TE>

<LD>I am writing to express my opposition to a proposed transmission line
in the Cleveland National Forest that San Diego Gas &amp; Electric has
proposed and that Rep. Darrell Issa has submitted to Congress in the
form of H.R. 5409. This project has many problems. One of them is
Issa's attempt to exempt this project from the National Environmental
Protection Act and other federal environmental laws, rules and
regulations that call for studies, guidance and oversight. It is
necessary to protect public lands here in Southern California from
development, which will ruin the natural character of our mountains
and deserts.</LD>
<LD>   I am adamantly opposed to tying this project to the Lake Elsinore
Advanced Pumped Storage project, which would take water from Lake
Elsinore to a reservoir to be built in Morrel Canyon, a pristine area
adjacent to the San Mateo Wilderness. According to the Wilderness
Act, large projects are not to be built within view of any
wilderness. The face of the Morrel Canyon dam would be in the line of
sight from the wilderness. The San Mateo Wilderness is home to many
endangered species. Morrel Canyon should be added to the wilderness,
not be a site for a commercial scheme such as the Lake Elsinore
Advanced Pumped Storage project.</LD>

<LD>Re: "San Juan Sports Site OKd," Oct. 19:</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps it is time that we "Indians" begin moving out the
headstones and "developing" the white cemeteries in such manners that
would deny you the ability to visit those burial sites and pay your
respects and that would obliterate any trace of who is buried at the
sites and where they are buried. How would nonindigenous people react
to such desecration of your ancestors' and loved ones' graves? Would
you want the graves of your grandmother, grandfather, mother, father,
sister, brother, husband or wife trampled upon, their grave markers
destroyed -- and perhaps their remains broken to pieces and
destroyed? Would you want a building erected on top of their graves,
forever denying you and your family that comes after you any access
to or remembrance of their places of rest?</LD>
<LD>   Maybe nonindigenous Americans do not respect the memories or
spirits of their ancestors and deceased loved ones the way indigenous
Americans do.</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps you do not believe in an afterlife. Perhaps you no longer
value family and spirituality. Perhaps you no longer recognize the
eternity of the soul and the importance of honoring your ancestors.
If that is so, then I pity you. However, that is not sufficient
reason for denying indigenous Americans our rights to honor and
protect our ancestors' burial sites and to expect others to respect
our rights.</TE>

<HD>School Raided in Bali Probe</HD>
<DH>Indonesian police call rural Islamic center 'headquarters
of the plot' to blow up nightclubs. Five men are under investigation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard C. Paddock</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TENGGULUN, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>Hunting three fugitive brothers who are suspected terrorists, police
raided an Islamic boarding school here Saturday where they believe
plotters who blew up two nightclubs on the island of Bali last month
were based.</LD>
<LD>   Five men connected with the Al-Islam school in this remote East
Java village -- two cofounders, the director and two teachers -- are
under investigation for their role in the car bombing that killed at
least 191 people.</LD>
<LD>   Two alleged members of the purported terrorist cell have been
taken into custody. They include a cofounder of the school known as
Amrozi who authorities say has admitted playing a key role in the
bombing. On Friday, police detained the school director, Zakaria, who
like many Indonesians goes by only one name.</LD>
<TE>   Police are searching for the other three, all brothers of Amrozi.</TE>
<TE>   The horror of the Bali bombing was so great that many Indonesians
refuse to believe their fellow citizens could have carried it out.
But police are finding strong evidence that the perpetrators were
home-grown Muslim militants with links to the Al Qaeda terrorist
network.</TE>
<TE>   "The headquarters of the plot is the Islamic boarding school we
just raided," said Agung, a police investigator. "There are a lot of
suspects here, the planner, the mastermind. They are criminals with
religion as their mask."</TE>
<TE>   Police said the rundown Al-Islam pesantren is affiliated with the
Al-Mukmin school in Central Java province founded by Abu Bakar
Bashir, a militant cleric. Bashir was taken into custody last month
in connection with several terrorist bombings but has not been
charged in the Bali blast.</TE>
<TE>   At least three of the alleged Al-Islam cell members were once
students at Bashir's Al-Mukmin pesantren, police and local
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the Al-Mukmin graduates, Amrozi's youngest brother, Ali
Imron, detonated the Bali car bomb, police say.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir is accused of heading the secretive Jemaah Islamiah
terrorist group, which has allegedly been responsible for dozens of
bombings in Southeast Asia that have killed more than 40 people.
Police said the Al-Islam cell was part of the Jemaah Islamiah
network, and suspect that Jemaah Islamiah financed the cell's
activities.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir traveled at least twice to the isolated village, where he
visited the school and Amrozi's home. The well-known cleric's most
recent visit was in June, just before Amrozi purchased the white
Mitsubishi minivan used in the Bali bombing.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir has admitted visiting the Al-Islam school but denies any
part in terrorist activities.</TE>
<TE>   Tenggulun, about a two-hour drive west of the city of Surabaya, is
one of the poorest villages in East Java. Most residents support
themselves by growing rice and corn. Many of the houses are in need
of repair, and cows outnumber cars on the village streets.</TE>
<TE>   Amrozi, who grew up in Tenggulun, is one of 13 children by his
father's two wives. Amrozi and at least three of his seven brothers
founded the Al-Islam school in 1993, authorities said. Today, it has
about 150 students who come from all over Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday morning, the students could be heard in their
classrooms chanting verses from the Koran in Arabic.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, more than a dozen police mounted the raid, searching
for photographs and other evidence that would lead them to the three
brothers, who disappeared after Amrozi was arrested Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   As police armed with automatic rifles stood guard, plainclothes
intelligence officers combed through the meager belongings in the
tiny, roughly made rooms occupied by Zakaria, the school principal,
and several teachers, including Amrozi's half-brother Ali Fauzi, 35.</TE>
<TE>   In Zakaria's quarters, a baby slept on a mat on the concrete floor
as officers pored over family photos and documents written in Arabic
and Indonesian.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Zakaria strongly resembles photos of Southeast Asia's
most wanted terrorist, Hambali, and speculated that they might be the
same person. However, the chances seem slim, because Hambali is
reported to be constantly on the move while Zakaria has been working
at the school for nearly a decade.</TE>
<TE>   In another apartment, police seized photos of faculty members
dressed in camouflage gear -- evidence, they said, of the rigorous
military training that the students undergo. Several students,
however, denied ever receiving military-style training and said the
pictures were taken during a camping trip.</TE>
<TE>   In one teacher's room, police searched through a cabinet adorned
with a sticker that read: "I am a Muslim child. I love the truth."</TE>
<TE>   Police were led to the school earlier in the week by tracing the
chassis number of the minivan used in the bombing back to Amrozi, the
last registered owner of the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Someone had filed off the number before the Oct. 12 blast but left
enough of the underlying metal so that Western forensic experts
assisting in the investigation could decipher the digits.</TE>
<TE>   Metal shavings that may have come from the chassis were discovered
in one of Amrozi's three workshops in the village, police said. They
said they took them to Bali for analysis, along with a rear seat and
air conditioner apparently removed from the Mitsubishi before the
bombing.</TE>
<TE>   Amrozi has confessed to making the bomb in a house in Bali the
week before the blast with chemicals he purchased in East Java, the
authorities say.</TE>
<TE>   Police are searching for a friend of Amrozi's named Harsono, a
resident of a nearby village who allegedly drove the minivan from
Tenggulun to Bali.</TE>
<TE>   Villagers recall Amrozi as a social, outgoing youth who sometimes
got in trouble with the authorities until the early 1990s, when he
began traveling to and from neighboring Malaysia.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Indonesia was ruled by a brutal general, Suharto, and
many militant Muslims -- including Bashir and Hambali -- had fled to
Malaysia.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear what Amrozi did there, but police say he confessed
that he once traveled to Afghanistan. It is possible that he attended
an Al Qaeda training camp there and learned the skills needed to
build the Bali car bomb.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, he came back to Tenggulun wearing the robes, cap and
beard typical of devout Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   "Once he returned from Malaysia," recalled neighbor Maftuhin, "he
changed 180 degrees."</TE>
<TE>   Amrozi lived next door to his parents in a house that was
surrounded Saturday by yellow police tape. He and his third wife
shared a small, sparsely furnished room, sleeping on a thin mat on
the floor. In their room were two sewing machines and a small pile of
unfinished women's veils on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   The couple shared the house with Amrozi's brother Gufron, 42, an
Al-Mukmin graduate and one of the cofounders of the Al-Islam school.
Authorities said that Gufron once opened an Islamic school in
Malaysia but that it was shut down by the government in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Gufron is wanted by police along with brothers Ali Imron and Ali
Fauzi, both teachers at the Al-Islam school.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they are not seeking to arrest two other brothers who
cofounded the school.</TE>
<TE>   Before the bombing, Amrozi made a modest living repairing
motorcycles and buying and selling cars. Residents said they recalled
seeing him in the newly purchased white minivan in the months before
the bombing.</TE>
<TE>   "He used it to drive around the village," said Sartono, 38, a
farmer. "I was very surprised when I heard the car was used to bomb
Bali."</TE>
<TE>   Amrozi also repaired cellular phones. Police say the bomb's
detonator may have been made from a cell phone.</TE>
<TE>   Tenggulun is so isolated that there is no mobile phone service,
but Amrozi built an antenna in his front yard that enabled him to use
his cell phone at home. Police suspect that it allowed him to keep in
touch with Jemaah Islamiah leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said Amrozi didn't talk much about religion. Nor did he
say that he hated Americans -- although police say that's the reason
he gave them for blowing up the nightclubs.</TE>
<TE>   Family members who remain in the village insisted that Amrozi and
his brothers are innocent. They complained that the police have been
continually searching their homes, seizing cars, papers, photos and
other property.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very depressed because the police are coming to the house
every day," said Alimah, Amrozi's eldest sister. "They have raided
all the family houses. They take everything."</TE>

<LD>   Rural Fire Service spokesman John Winter said the situation at
Mittagong, 60 miles southwest of Sydney, was "very grave."</LD>
<LD>   Thick black smoke hung over nearby towns as residents hosed down
their roofs to protect their homes from the flames. Almost 100 bush
fires are burning across Australia's New South Wales state. Some
families were evacuated north of Sydney in the Hunter Valley wine

<HD>500 Iranian Students Protest the Judiciary</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>TEHRAN</DL>
<LD>Hundreds of Iranian students chanting, "Political prisoners should be
released!" protested against Iran's hard-line judiciary Saturday
night in the nation's biggest political demonstration in more than
three years.</LD>
<LD>   The protest coincided with mounting tension in the country of 65
million as reformist President Mohammad Khatami seeks to break
conservatives' stranglehold on the heart of the political system.</LD>
<LD>   About 500 students made fires outside Tehran University's campus
gates and chanted, "Freedom of thought forever!" and "Our problem is
the judiciary!" witnesses said.</LD>
<TE>   Police blocked off roads surrounding the campus and fired at least
one tear-gas canister. But they made no move toward the students. The
protest began to fizzle out about 1 a.m. today, about five hours
after it started.</TE>
<TE>   The demonstration came days after a hard-line court sentenced
reformist Tehran University academic Hashem Aghajari to death for
blasphemy after he questioned the clergy's right to rule the Islamic
Republic. He was also accused of insulting the prophet Muhammad.</TE>
<TE>   "Execution of Aghajari is execution of thought in Iran!" the
students shouted as dozens of plainclothes police and members of the
radical conservative vigilante group Ansar-e Hezbollah watched from
behind the police cordon, witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   Khatami has found his efforts to promote democracy blocked by
conservative rivals who control the judiciary, armed forces and
broadcast media.</TE>

<HD>Iraq Studies 'Bad and Unjust' U.N. Resolution</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>While accusing the U.S. of blackmailing the U.N. to adopt a "bad and
unjust" resolution, Iraqi officials said Saturday they were studying
the world body's call to eliminate banned weapons. Arab leaders
voiced optimism that Baghdad would comply.</LD>
<LD>   "Iraq has not issued a decision and Iraq is studying this
resolution," Foreign Minister Naji Sabri told reporters after a
meeting of Arab League foreign ministers in Cairo.</LD>
<LD>   The resolution, passed unanimously by the U.N. Security Council on
Friday, gives Iraq seven days to respond to a demand to readmit
weapons inspectors. After talks with Sabri, Egyptian Foreign Minister
Ahmed Maher said Baghdad had expressed readiness to readmit the
inspectors.</LD>
<TE>   Diplomats and other officials involved in the Arab League meeting,
which continues today, said Iraq would face intense pressure --
though mostly in private -- to agree to the terms of the resolution.
A senior Egyptian official said that even if there is no official
statement calling for Iraq's acquiescence, Iraq "will receive a clear
message that compliance is the right thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   "Most Arab governments will be delivering this message," the
official said. "Nobody wants to see a war."</TE>
<TE>   The influential Iraqi newspaper Babel, owned by President Saddam
Hussein's son Uday, indicated in an editorial Saturday that
compliance was likely. "Iraq has nothing to conceal, and U.N. weapons
inspectors are welcome," it said.</TE>
<TE>   Sabri endeavored to cast the resolution's passage as something
other than a victory for Washington, saying that in the negotiations
on the text, the international community succeeded in diluting U.S.
plans for aggression against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, in Baghdad, the official Iraqi news agency kept up a
barrage of criticism of the United States and the U.N. action,
calling the resolution "bad and unjust."</TE>
<TE>   In Baghdad, citizens reacted with apprehension, anger and defiance
to the resolution's approval. Many said they wanted peace but feared
war was inevitable. "This should not be called the Security Council,
it should be called the Bush council, because it is America that
directs it. It uses its members as chess pawns," said Khaled Khalifa,
a 43-year-old teacher.</TE>

<HD>Ivory Coast Rebels Pull Out of Peace Negotiations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LOME, Togo</DL>
<LD>The leaders of a seven-week insurgency that has left hundreds dead in
Ivory Coast withdrew from peace talks Saturday after a rebel leader's
brother was slain in government-held territory.</LD>
<LD>   Rebel negotiator Guillaume Soro accused the government of
fostering a "reign of terror" and said the insurgents would return to
the talks only if President Laurent Gbagbo pledged to guarantee
security in the country. A government response was not immediately
available.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement raised the specter of renewed fighting in a
country that was the most prosperous and stable in West Africa until
a 1999 coup. A coup attempt in September this year led to further
instability in Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa producer.</LD>
<TE>   The rebels said they were withdrawing from the talks after Benoit
Dacoury-Tabley, brother of the rebels' representative in Europe, was
found shot to death Friday, a day after he was taken away by
uniformed men. His body was found in a suburb of Abidjan, Ivory
Coast's main city.</TE>
<TE>   But a West African mediator, Mohammed ibn Chambas, said the
rebels' withdrawal would not affect the 3-week-old cease-fire being
monitored by French troops.</TE>
<TE>   "The cease-fire holds, and it is our expectation that both sides
will continue to respect it," he said here in Lome, Togo, where peace
negotiations have been underway.</TE>
<TE>   Soro told a news conference in Lome that the talks were not being
ended permanently. "As soon as the conditions are right, we are ready
to restart negotiations at any moment," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels say they are fighting to protect the rights of
predominantly Muslim northern Ivorians, who complain of
discrimination and harassment by the Christian and animist southern
tribes that traditionally have dominated the government.</TE>

<HD>Israeli Forces Kill Senior Members of Islamic Jihad</HD>
<DH>Manhunt for Iyad Sawalha, accused of masterminding bus
bombings, ends in firefight during army operation in Jenin.</DH>

<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>In a predawn gun battle Saturday, Israeli troops killed a senior
leader of the Islamic Jihad group who was wanted for allegedly
masterminding a fiery bus bombing less than three weeks ago that
killed 14 Israelis, burning many alive.</LD>
<LD>   Iyad Sawalha, the target of an intensive Israeli manhunt in recent
weeks, was tracked down to a cinderblock house at the edge of the
maze-like casbah in the West Bank city of Jenin.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli troops burst in before dawn, uncovered an underground
chamber in which Sawalha was hiding and killed him in a brief but
fierce firefight, during which he hurled a grenade and fired at
soldiers with an assault rifle, Israeli security sources said.</LD>
<TE>   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat denounced the killing, and
Islamic Jihad, which along with the militant group Hamas has been
responsible for dozens of attacks aimed at Israelis over the last two
years, vowed that it would exact vengeance.</TE>
<TE>   "Our jihad will continue," said Sheik Abdullah Shami, an Islamic
Jihad leader in the Gaza Strip. "This criminal event will not break
our strength."</TE>
<TE>   Arafat said the killing was a desecration of the Muslim holy month
of Ramadan, which began last week.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very big crime that was committed through military
aggression against our people and against our religious holidays,"
the Palestinian Authority president told journalists at his
headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   Israel defended its action as crucial to its campaign to halt
suicide bombings, which have killed and injured hundreds of Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question that an important part of the war against
terror is breaking apart the organizational infrastructure of such
groups," said Dore Gold, a policy advisor to Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   Sawalha, 28, who led Islamic Jihad's operations in the northern
part of the West Bank, was directly blamed by Israel for bus bombings
in northern Israel that claimed 31 lives in the last five months.</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen Israelis were killed Oct. 21 outside the town of Hadera
when an explosives-laden SUV slammed into their bus, and 17 were
killed in a similar attack June 5 near Megiddo, the biblical
Armageddon.</TE>
<TE>   In the Hadera attack, the bus' fuel tank exploded when the bomb
went off, triggering an inferno that trapped many of the passengers,
burning them to death while would-be rescuers looked on helplessly.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli authorities also said Sawalha masterminded a failed
attempt in September to smuggle a car bomb primed with 770 pounds of
explosives into northern Israel with the intention of blowing up a
residential building. The attack was foiled when the car was spotted
and the drivers fled.</TE>
<TE>   Israel considered Sawalha particularly dangerous in part because
the operations he allegedly planned employed methods and tactics not
commonly seen during the last 25 months of violence: making use of
powerful car bombs rather than attackers who approach their targets
on foot with a relatively small payload of explosives strapped to
their bodies.</TE>
<TE>   Once a vehicle filled with explosives has successfully crossed
from the West Bank into Israel, it is extremely difficult to detect
it and prevent an attack, military officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last two years, Israel has carried out targeted killings
-- assassinations, the Palestinians and human rights groups call them
-- of more than two dozen Palestinian militants who it says
orchestrated attacks against Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   This time, however, the army appeared eager to show that its
intention had been to arrest Sawalha if possible.</TE>
<TE>   In an unusual move, the military released a three-minute videotape
that showed troops with night-vision equipment fanning out and
stealthily approaching the house, then searching it as they called
out for Sawalha to come out and give himself up.</TE>
<TE>   The footage did not include the reported exchange of fire but did
feature a lingering shot of its aftermath -- a pool of blood and a
hand grenade on the floor of the rubble-filled enclosure beneath the
house. The video also showed the body, covered with a white sheet,
being loaded into an ambulance.</TE>
<TE>   Graphic footage shot later Saturday by Associated Press Television
News, when the body was handed over to the Palestinian Red Crescent
Society, showed Sawalha's uncovered body, clad in a T-shirt soaked
with blood and bearing the reproduction of a "martyr poster" -- a
picture of a suicide bomber wreathed in Koranic verses.</TE>
<TE>   Sawalha's eyes were open, and his right arm was raised. The hand
had been blown off, leaving only a scorched stump.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors reported that after the troops closed in, Sawalha's wife
came out of the house and surrendered while he stayed inside. They
said the exchange of fire lasted nearly an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Jenin, which Israel says has been the source of dozens of suicide
attacks, has been under a tight lockdown since the Israeli army moved
in three days after the Hadera bombing with hundreds of troops backed
by tanks and armor.</TE>
<TE>   Curfews have been lifted occasionally for the city's 50,000
residents to shop for supplies, but troops have maintained a tight
circle around the perimeter.</TE>
<TE>   Sawalha had been the prime target in house-to-house searches for
Islamic Jihad figures and other militants, many of whom went
literally underground after the Israelis moved in. Last week, the
army arrested Sawalha's top deputy after cornering him in a similar
chamber carved beneath the floor of a house.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, the army said a soldier was killed and an officer was
seriously wounded Saturday by a roadside bomb in the Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian militants have mounted attacks along Gaza roads used
exclusively by Jewish settlers and Israeli military vehicles and have
planted bombs powerful enough to destroy Israeli tanks.</TE>

<HD>Afghan Banks Are Flush With Disposable Cash</HD>
<DH>Officials have taken to shredding and burning outdated bank
notes, but the piles still grow.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Zucchino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Last month, Afghanistan's government began circulating new currency
as the first step toward overhauling the country's primitive monetary
system.</LD>
<LD>   This month, the government is encountering a problem: What to do
with hundreds of millions of old bank notes dating to the 1930s?</LD>
<LD>   At first, the solution was to shred them. But as thousands of
Afghans traveled to Kabul, the capital, with old notes collected from
mattresses and breadboxes, the Central Bank's 13 shredding machines
couldn't keep up with the tidal wave of bills.</LD>
<TE>   Now the notes are being burned in five brick ovens in a muddy
parking lot behind the Finance Ministry. But even as two new ovens
are being built and workers madly heave thick wads of currency into
roaring bonfires day after day, the notes keep coming faster than
they can be burned.</TE>
<TE>   "You could say we have a backlog," said Anwar-ul-Haq Ahady, the
governor of the Central Bank, his finely coiffed hair and herringbone
suit flecked with gray ash as he supervised the burning.</TE>
<TE>   All around Ahady, 6-inch-thick bundles of blue and red bank notes
were stacked like bricks in several neat piles 15 feet long and 2
feet high. As workers hurled the bundles two at a time into the
ovens, two trucks stood waiting, stuffed to capacity with bricks of
cash by the thousands.</TE>
<TE>   The government has printed 28 billion new afghanis to replace the
old notes, which remain valid until at least Dec. 4. Three zeros have
been lopped from the old bills to reduce the number of notes required
for day-to-day transactions. For example, the old 10,000-afghani
notes -- about 20 cents at the current exchange rate -- are being
replaced by 10-afghani notes, with the new currency trading at 50
afghanis to the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   The new currency, like the old, will float with the market and be
backed by Afghanistan's gold and hard-currency reserves.</TE>
<TE>   With the old currency, it takes a grocery bag full of notes to buy
a kebab lunch. U.S. dollars and Pakistani rupees are used for major
purchases. In a nation without much of a formal banking system and
with a cash-only economy, credit cards are not accepted and checks
cannot be redeemed.</TE>
<TE>   The new currency, introduced Oct. 7, is intended to be the
building block for a more supple and modern financial system. But the
way the overburdened and underfinanced government is managing the
transition speaks volumes about the state of affairs here. If the
haphazard swapping and burning of bank notes are any indication, the
country's hopes of entering the 21st century world economy may not be
realized any time soon.</TE>
<TE>   People panicked, for instance, when the government asked citizens
to exchange largest bills first to speed the process. That only
stoked fears that smaller bills would not be accepted, so people
swarmed to government banks with millions of old notes in small
denominations: 1,000 and 5,000 afghanis.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had some logistical problems," Ahady said, still struggling
to find a way to smoothly exchange new bills for an estimated 13
trillion old afghanis that must be destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   Inside Kabul's Pashtani Tejarity bank last week, the corridors
were lined with bedraggled men who said they had waited as long as
three days to reach the tellers' windows. They sat on the floor,
surrounded by burlap sacks and plastic shopping bags stuffed with
wrinkled bank notes that they counted by hand.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the people are quite angry at having to wait so long, but
everyone will get their money, of this I am sure," said assistant
bank director Daoud Bedar, dressed in a coat and tie and besieged by
bearded men in turbans and ragged tunics.</TE>
<TE>   Shir Mohammed, a stout farmer of 40, had brought his life savings
-- 120 million old afghanis, worth about $2,400 -- in four huge grain
bags. He had taken an eight-hour taxi ride from Kapisa province. Wary
of bandits, he had brought along his cousin as a bodyguard.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed was eager to unburden himself of his load. "I'll trade
this for new bills, which I can hide in my coat and no one will know
I have so much money," he said.</TE>
<TE>   There are 47 Central Bank locations nationwide for people to trade
in their old currency. But by custom and tradition, many assume that
only Kabul can truly provide for their needs. So half the old money
exchanged so far has come through Kabul, Ahady said, overwhelming its
banks.</TE>
<TE>   The proof lay in the Pashtani Tejarity bank basement, where
shredded notes were piled in mounds the size of haystacks, spilling
out doorways and into the subterranean passageways. Ghulam Nabi
mounted a courageous but hopeless assault against the tide, trying to
stuff the confetti into plastic bags. The bank was donating the
shredded notes to the poor to burn for heat and cooking; on the
streets, donkeys could be seen hauling the bags homeward.</TE>
<TE>   "On our best day, we shredded 12 billion afghanis," Nabi said, his
hair and clothes festooned with shredded cash that fell softly like
snow. "But the shredding machine couldn't handle the demand, so we
gave up. Now we are stuck with all this shredded money."</TE>
<TE>   The burning was not going much faster. The ovens were glowing as
Ahady, the bank governor, gamely selected random bundles of blue
10,000-afghani notes. He was frantically feeding them into a counting
machine strapped to a tree to verify that each representative bundle
contained 100 bills.</TE>
<TE>   The governor was worried about fraud. Just that morning, he said,
he had fired a cashier for pilfering bank notes. Several people have
been arrested for theft, he said, and special teams of police and
bank officials were monitoring the process.</TE>
<TE>   Ahady himself was guarded by two bearded young men with
Kalashnikov rifles.</TE>
<TE>   There was also the matter of competing versions of the old
currency, some counterfeit and others technically legal. The
government, in a move that seemed to legitimize money laundering and
encourage an eleventh-hour surge of printing, agreed to accept at 50%
value notes issued by warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum and others. Ahady's
signature is on every new bill.</TE>
<TE>   As sunset neared, the ovens burned on and the governor continued
feeding the counting machines. The workers heaved more bundles into
the flames. Millions of afghanis turned to ash as the minutes ticked
by.</TE>
<TE>   And still they were losing ground. More trucks were coming with
bricks of cash. More than 130 billion afghanis had been burned the
day before. But on this day, the workers would be lucky to burn 90
billion's worth because so many of the bills were small
denominations.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the volume of old notes still being redeemed, Ahady
suggested that the Dec. 4 deadline for exchanging old bills might be
pushed back.</TE>
<TE>   The governor brushed his sleeve and wiped the blue smoke from his
eyes. He watched more bills feed the raging fires.</TE>
<TE>   He would be back the next day, he vowed, and every day until the
last of the cash that represented Afghanistan's old ways was consumed
by the flames.</TE>

<HD>Party Chief Wants U.S. Out of Pakistan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>A leader of Pakistan's religious right, coming off the bloc's best
election showing in the country's 55-year history, demanded Saturday
that the U.S. military leave the country.</LD>
<LD>   "We were opposed to their war in Afghanistan before, and we are
opposed now. The vote of the people was clear: They want them out of
Pakistan," Maulana Fazlur Rehman said in an interview.</LD>
<LD>   Last month's general elections, the first since military rule was
imposed here in 1999, gave the religious right 59 seats out of 342 in
parliament. The pro-military party won 103 seats, far short of the
172 needed to form a government. Former Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto's party controls 80 seats and may form an alliance with the
religious bloc.</LD>
<TE>   The six-party alliance of religious parties, of which Rehman's
party is a dominant partner, campaigned almost exclusively on an
anti-American platform. It demanded U.S. soldiers leave Pakistan and
neighboring Afghanistan, criticizing President Pervez Musharraf's
support for the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Rehman's lieutenant, Mir Hussain Gillani, added that it was the
religious duty of every Pakistani Muslim to protect and offer
sanctuary to Taliban forces and Al Qaeda members.</TE>
<TE>   He said Osama bin Laden was not a terrorist. "Osama is one of the
biggest followers of Islam," he said. "What has the United States and
the West proven that he has done?"</TE>

<HD>A Chinese City's Porters Carry the Weight of History</HD>
<DH>'Bang-bang men' in Chongqing are a throwback in a rapidly
changing country.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Henry Chu</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CHONGQING, China</DL>
<LD>Modernity glistens off a million surfaces of this bustling city, from
the downtown high-rise office windows to the golden arches that
invite diners in for a quick han-bao-bao and fries.</LD>
<LD>   But on every street corner stand human reminders of Chongqing's
centuries-old past: men who sell their strength for a living, and who
easily pick out a customer's call through the buzz of a noisy crowd.</LD>
<LD>   "Bang-bang! Bang-bang!" goes the cry.</LD>
<TE>   With stout bamboo poles slung on their shoulders, the men scurry
over to their summoner, who points at various bags and parcels to be
transported. One man can usually handle the lot, suspending the items
on opposite ends of the pole. He then carries the load like a yoke to
wherever the customer orders -- in exchange for less than a dollar.</TE>
<TE>   These workers form Chongqing's army of "bang-bang men," plying a
backbreaking trade that has existed here since imperial times and
that relies on nothing except muscle.</TE>
<TE>   Similar jobs involving brute strength for hire have faded from the
scene in China, banned as demeaning feudal practices by the
Communists who took power in 1949. Rickshaws are a relic of the past.
Nobody rides around in sedan chairs anymore.</TE>
<TE>   But the bang-bang men have remained a fixture on the landscape
here, another of the jarring juxtapositions of old and new in a
country that is changing at dizzying speed.</TE>
<TE>   Chongqing's landscape is partly what gave rise to the bang-bang
men -- and why residents continue to think of them as a necessity.
The city, which sits at the confluence of two rivers, is extremely
hilly, which made it difficult in the days before mechanization for
ordinary people to transport heavy objects, even for short distances.</TE>
<TE>   The invention of the bicycle didn't help much; hardly a bike is to
be seen in Chongqing because of its rolling terrain. Although cars
now zip around town on the well-paved boulevards, taxis are still
regarded as too expensive for such mundane tasks as hauling a package
to a home within walking distance.</TE>
<TE>   So the bang-bang men -- their name, pronounced bong-bong, comes
from the local dialect and refers to their bamboo poles -- are a
ubiquitous sight. They shuffle along in their shabby shoes, their
shoulders sagging from the weight of all manner of goods that have to
get from point A to point B.</TE>
<TE>   Stores dispatch bang-bang men to deliver television sets, stereo
equipment, containers full of chemicals or huge blocks of ice.
Residents hire them to haul their groceries or take their suitcases
down to the dock. One recent afternoon, four hard-breathing bang-bang
workers carried a massive metal turbine between them, their poles
interlocking to distribute the weight, their grunts punctuating the
whoosh of passing traffic.</TE>
<TE>   At times, Chongqing -- China's most populous city -- resembles a
giant outdoor hotel, with tens of thousands of porters waiting for
work, eking out a meager living from the tips that the better-off
bestow on them for their trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "Chongqing is a mountainous city. There are steep slopes and tall
buildings without elevators, so people need us," said Huang Qianfu as
he waited for someone to hire him.</TE>
<TE>   A new father at 30, Huang doesn't look particularly brawny, but he
has carried up to 200 pounds of goods at once.</TE>
<TE>   "We're cheap compared to other methods" of transport, he said.
"Take a taxi.... That'll cost you at least 5 yuan [about 60 cents]. I
only charge 3 to 4."</TE>
<TE>   Like most bang-bang men these days, Huang is a farmer who comes to
Chongqing in search of work in the off-season. In cities throughout
China, migrant rural laborers perform the menial, manual work that
increasingly prosperous city folk consider to be beneath them.</TE>
<TE>   Life in the big city is hard for the bang-bang men, whose numbers
may be as high as 200,000, according to one estimate. They often live
in tenements, with many sharing a single rundown room. Competition
for work can be fierce, as are occasional turf battles. Popular beats
include the wharves along the Yangtze River, where bang-bang men have
been ferrying goods to and fro for cargo ships and passengers since
at least the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).</TE>
<TE>   Another coveted area is "Appliance Alley," a downtown stretch of
shops specializing in electronics. Men mill around, hoping for a
commission to haul merchandise they can almost never hope to buy
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   On average, bang-bang workers earn $60 to $75 a month; a good
month brings in about $120. The lion's share of their earnings often
gets sent back to their families in the countryside.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to be a bang-bang, [but] I can't find other work in
Chongqing," Huang said.</TE>
<TE>   To film director Shu Yide, the hardscrabble lives of the bang-bang
men seemed the perfect subject for dramatic treatment. In 1996, he
shot a television miniseries chronicling the vicissitudes of a group
of fictional farmers who find work in Chongqing as bang-bang workers.
The characters work hard to save up money for different reasons: one
to afford a wife, another to go to college, a third to pay his
children's school fees.</TE>
<TE>   To prep them for their roles, Shu had his local actors spend 10
days on the streets selling their muscle power.</TE>
<TE>   On one occasion, two of them were hired to deliver a refrigerator
to a customer who lived on the ninth floor. Their tip: about 60 cents
between them, which was considered generous.</TE>
<TE>   "Bang-Bang Army," Shu's 20-part miniseries, proved popular with
audiences across China. Its success vindicated his efforts, which at
first met with a chilly reception from the then-chief of Chongqing's
propaganda department, who thought that the drama made the city
appear backward and laughable.</TE>
<TE>   "Later, the department chief went to the central party school in
Beijing to study, and at the time, Beijing was broadcasting
'Bang-Bang Army,' " Shu said. "He said he was very embarrassed and
afraid that the other cadres would ridicule him for Chongqing's
backwardness. Instead, they congratulated him on having produced such
a good series."</TE>
<TE>   Shu was encouraged to make the program by a boss who wanted some
record of bang-bang men before they disappear from Chongqing as
private car ownership rises.</TE>
<TE>   That day seems far off to Meng Qimin, a farmer who has been doing
porter work for seven years to supplement his household income.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very tiring job, but no pain, no gain," said Meng, 47. "I
can do it for a few more years. After I turn 50, I might not be able
to anymore."</TE>

<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Prosecutor Raja Qureshi, who secured the convictions of four men in
the slaying of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, has
submitted a letter of resignation, Pakistan's government said
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Qureshi did not say why he wanted to step down, Interior Minister
Moinuddin Haider said, but his assistants said on condition of
anonymity that Qureshi had received threatening letters and phone
calls.</LD>
<LD>   Qureshi told reporters Friday that he would explain his reasons
for leaving later.</LD>
<TE>   He successfully prosecuted four Islamic militants who were
convicted in July of kidnapping and killing Pearl, the Journal's
South Asia bureau chief.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl disappeared in Karachi while working on a story in January
about Muslim militants. His dismembered body was found in May outside
Karachi, Pakistan's largest city and a hotbed of Islamic
fundamentalism.</TE>
<TE>   The court sentenced one of the four men -- British-born militant
Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh -- to be hanged for his role in Pearl's
abduction and death. The other three were sentenced to 25 years in
prison.</TE>

has another chance to help the struggling economy.</LD>

<HD>Antiwar Activists March in Italy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Holley and Maria De Cristofaro</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>ROME</DL>
<LD>Hundreds of thousands of activists from across Europe marched
peacefully through Florence, Italy, on Saturday in a long-planned
anti-globalization protest that became a festive rally against a
possible U.S.-led war on Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Headed by a banner proclaiming "No War," the march came a day
after the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously to give Iraq "a
final opportunity" to rid itself of weapons of mass destruction or
face "serious consequences." Police estimated the crowd at 450,000.
Many of the participants came on chartered buses and special trains.</LD>
<LD>   The march was the focal point of a five-day gathering of activists
who argue that global trade and international corporations work
against the welfare of the world's poor and the Earth's environment.
Although sentiment against an Iraq war was already high, it was the
timing of the Security Council's action that turned the march into an
antiwar rally. Many protesters said that Washington's real goal in
Iraq is to control its oil.</LD>
<TE>   "Stop Global War," "Take Your War and Go to Hell," "Drop Bush, Not
Bombs" and "Thank You, Florence" were among the sentiments displayed
on posters and banners in various languages. Some depicted President
Bush as Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi as
Mussolini.</TE>
<TE>   Many shop owners had shuttered their doors and windows in fear of
violence, but some residents along the route offered glasses of water
to the marchers and cheered them on.</TE>
<TE>   Marchers ranged from veteran activists to first-time protesters.
There were pensioners, middle-aged homemakers, members of Roman
Catholic youth groups, representatives of unions and political
parties, street entertainers and plenty of young people out for fun.</TE>
<TE>   Some youths sported hair dyed pink or other bright colors, and
some protesters were dressed as clowns or chose to skate the 4-mile
route along the Arno River. Marchers sang Communist anthems and 1970s
peace songs and shouted "Hands off the Middle East!" and "The real
terrorist is the West!"</TE>
<TE>   The prominent French farm activist Jose Bove showed up on a
tractor.</TE>
<TE>   "We are against a preventive war, against the Bush administration,
and we will do everything we can to prevent a new war and military
intervention in Iraq," said Vannino Chiti, a coordinator for
participants from the Democrats of the Left, the country's largest
opposition party.</TE>
<TE>   Sergio Cofferati, a former head of CGIL, Italy's biggest trade
union, told reporters that politicians must pay more attention to
what the anti-globalization movement is saying.</TE>
<TE>   "An equal relationship based on mutual respect is required with
these movements," said Cofferati, viewed by many as a potential
future leader of the center-left in Italy. "Political forces and
especially the left would be making a mistake if they failed to
listen."</TE>
<TE>   Marchers touched on a host of issues. A middle-aged man told
state-run television: "We are workers from Fiat. We came because we
think Fiat is a typical example of a multinational, which is going to
colonize other countries -- workers from India, China, Turkey and
South America -- but will at the end be eaten up by General Motors."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's gathering was billed as the first European Social
Forum, a regional branch of the World Social Forum, which meets
annually in Porto Alegre, Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   Berlusconi had said it was "risky" to allow the event to take
place in art-rich Florence. But his government eventually approved,
and the country tightened border controls in an effort to keep out
individual protesters identified by authorities as potentially
violent.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of police were on duty for the march but kept a low
profile. Organizers had agreed to a route that avoided the historic
center of the Renaissance city filled with cultural treasures.</TE>
<TE>   Italian authorities had feared a repeat of the violent
demonstrations that marred a Group of 8 summit in the northwestern
city of Genoa last year.</TE>

people evolved from a long-planned anti-globalization event. A3</CP>

<HD>End to Chechen War Sought</HD>
<DH>Moscow conference calls for peace talks with rebels,
despite the idea's unpopularity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Russian human rights activists, liberal politicians and Chechen
representatives gathered here Saturday to discuss an unpopular idea:
peace talks to end the war in the separatist republic of Chechnya.</LD>
<LD>   "The authorities must show their wisdom in standing up for what is
absolutely vital for society: the immediate start of a peace process
in Chechnya, even if it goes against the mood in society," Lev
Ponomaryov, the head of the For Human Rights organization, told
several hundred delegates at the conference.</LD>
<LD>   The meeting came less than three weeks after a hostage crisis
brought the Chechen war to the Russian capital and hardened the
government's resolve not to enter talks with the rebels.</LD>
<TE>   The presidential human rights envoy for Chechnya, Abdul-Khakim
Sultygov, urged organizers to cancel the conference, saying it was
intended to "form an image of international terrorism with a 'human
face' " and was aimed at fulfilling the terrorists' demand.</TE>
<TE>   The attackers who seized the theater Oct. 23 threatened to blow it
up, with about 750 hostages inside, if Moscow did not end the war in
Chechnya. In the end, about 120 hostages were killed -- almost all by
an opiate-based gas used by special forces to knock out the rebels
before they could detonate their explosives. All of the roughly 50
militants also died.</TE>
<TE>   Prominent liberal politician Grigory A. Yavlinsky said he
participated in the conference to underscore what he feared was a
growing wave of ethnic hatred in Russia, fueled by semiofficial
propaganda.</TE>
<TE>   "Attempts to practically create an image of lower races and
unacceptable nationalities in government and semiofficial propaganda
is the most dangerous threat to the future of our country," Yavlinsky
said.</TE>
<TE>   Most speakers at the conference called on Russia to negotiate with
Aslan Maskhadov, a rebel leader and Chechnya's former president.</TE>
<TE>   Russian President Vladimir V. Putin has rejected Maskhadov as a
negotiator, calling him a terrorist. Still, the Kremlin said Saturday
that Putin was ready to discuss ideas for speeding up the
"constitutional process" in Chechnya with moderates.</TE>

<HD>A War of Words Led to Unanimous Iraq Vote</HD>
<DH>The long-sought U.N. resolution shows the extent of U.S.
power -- and its limits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tyler Marshall, Maggie Farley and Doyle McManus</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>America's victory at the United Nations that tightened the noose
around Iraqi President Saddam Hussein capped a diplomatic campaign
the Bush administration almost didn't fight.</LD>
<LD>   In the heat of this past summer, Vice President Dick Cheney and
some others close to the president argued for war to overthrow
Hussein and eliminate the threat of his suspected weapons of mass
destruction. Seeking the return of weapons inspectors or U.N.
approval of military action was a waste of precious time, they
insisted.</LD>
<LD>   But Secretary of State Colin L. Powell counseled that the best
road to Baghdad actually went through U.N. headquarters in New York.</LD>
<TE>   And so on a Friday in mid-August, after weeks of increasingly
sharp rhetoric from the administration, the White House
videoconferencing system brought the Bush foreign policy team
together to resolve the issue: Bush and National Security Advisor
Condoleezza Rice at the president's Texas ranch, and Powell, Cheney
and Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld sitting at a conference
table in the White House Situation Room.</TE>
<TE>   Their discussion that day launched the United States on nearly
three months of tortuous negotiations that led to Friday's unanimous
vote in the U.N. Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, there were behind-the-scenes efforts to defuse the
crisis: an improbable mission to Baghdad by an Arab diplomat who
suggested exile to Hussein, a failed bid to get Hussein on the phone
with former South African President Nelson Mandela.</TE>
<TE>   There were key moments behind closed doors when the diplomatic
momentum shifted, such as the Mexican U.N. ambassador's insistent
questioning that tipped a doubting Security Council toward accepting
what the United States wanted: a new resolution on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   There was British Prime Minister Tony Blair's patient insistence
on caution.</TE>
<TE>   And there were the very public pronouncements of Bush, Cheney and
Hussein that alternately reassured and frightened the world.</TE>
<TE>   The resolution that finally passed was a diplomatic compromise, a
textbook demonstration of the extent of U.S. power -- and an
expression of its limits.</TE>
<TE>   The United States won international legitimacy for its
confrontation with Baghdad, the likely backing of key allies if war
comes, and their help rebuilding a post-Hussein Iraq. Other nations
also got what they wanted most: confirmation of the Security Council
as the premier global authority to deal with international crises,
and a process that gave peace a final chance.</TE>
<TE>   More than any other time in memory, the United States used its
global dominance to intimidate rather than persuade. Threats of
unilateral military action, coupled with the knowledge that the U.S.
had the means to carry them out, moved reluctant powers to stand
against Hussein in a way few thought possible only weeks earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Although the United States, too, was forced to soften its stance,
and engage in dogged, patient negotiation, the result was a triumph
of a new kind of American assertiveness based as much on political,
economic and military dominance as it was on shared values or the
quality of its arguments.</TE>
<TE>   Intrigue in Washington</TE>
<TE>   The fear instilled by America's bellicose statements during the
summer was no accident. For months, Bush and his aides had drummed at
a single insistent theme: The United States was determined to
overthrow the Iraqi leader.</TE>
<TE>   As early as January, Bush made Iraq a central target of his State
of the Union address, when he identified it as part of an "Axis of
Evil" along with Iran and North Korea. Despite the shock of the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks, the administration was replacing Osama bin
Laden with Hussein as America's public enemy No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Most alarming to foreign leaders, Bush repeated the message in
private. He wanted them to know he was dead serious. After a visit to
Bush at his ranch near Crawford, Texas, on Aug. 1, Jordan's King
Abdullah II was distraught; he believed a war with Iraq would bring a
virtual "Armageddon" to his neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah was nearly as worried. He
warned that the United States could not count on using Saudi air
bases in a war -- an extraordinary position for a country that U.S.
troops still defend against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and his aides were hearing appeals from all quarters to slow
down. Republican elder statesmen such as Henry A. Kissinger and
Lawrence S. Eagleburger weighed in. Blair argued that his own Labor
Party would desert him if he joined an attack on Baghdad without an
effort to get a U.N. resolution.</TE>
<TE>   Over a four-day stay at his parents' summer house in
Kennebunkport, Maine, the president had "in-depth conversations" with
his father about Iraq, a person close to the former president said,
and those conversations appeared to affect the president's thinking.</TE>
<TE>   But inside the Bush Cabinet, two camps jousted. One, led by
Cheney, argued against another round of U.N. inspections. The other,
headed by Powell, underscored the benefits of a broad international
coalition.</TE>
<TE>   During the summer, Powell and Blair could sense that Bush was
moving to their side, if only as a practical matter. "It became clear
that we could not go to war nearly as well -- if at all -- without a
resolution," a senior U.S. official said.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 16, Rice flew to Bush's Texas ranch to act as moderator of
a videoconference of the administration's most senior foreign policy
and defense officials.</TE>
<TE>   Rice gave the floor to Powell. Appearing on the flat, four-paned
video screen, the secretary of State said they all agreed that
"regime change" was the right goal. The question was how best to
accomplish it.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. allies in Europe and the Arab world, including countries
important to any military operation, were virtually unanimous about
the need for U.N. agreement. For many of them, it would become a
matter of principle: an attack not sanctioned by the U.N., they
insisted, would be the first step toward an international law of the
jungle.</TE>
<TE>   Powell told Cheney and the other hawks that it was worth trying
for a tough U.N. resolution that would launch stringent arms
inspections. If the U.N. couldn't agree, he said, the U.S. would
still come out ahead; merely trying, he said, would make it easier
for others to join a coalition against Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, he promised, the United States wouldn't give up its
right to attack Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Security Council doesn't deal with it effectively, we
reserve our right to do what is necessary," Powell said, according to
an aide.</TE>
<TE>   There was a discussion of whether inspections could succeed.
Powell agreed that the rules had to be much tougher. Rice polled the
participants. The tally was unanimous in favor of trying the U.N.
route.</TE>
<TE>   The next steps were to draft a speech for the president to give at
the U.N., quietly brief Blair and a few other close allies, and
prepare a diplomatic campaign.</TE>
<TE>   But Cheney still wanted to make sure his concerns were clear. Ten
days after the Crawford meeting, he was scheduled to give a speech in
Nashville to the Veterans of Foreign Wars. The vice president didn't
show the speech to Powell, but he did tell Bush that it would be
"tough," one aide said. "Fine," the president reportedly replied.</TE>
<TE>   Tough it was.</TE>
<TE>   "A return of inspectors would provide no assurance whatsoever of
[Hussein's] compliance with U.N. resolutions," Cheney warned. "On the
contrary, there is a great danger that it would provide false comfort
that Saddam was somehow 'back in his box.' "</TE>
<TE>   Cheney aides argued that the speech didn't go beyond what had been
agreed. But to the American public and the world, it sounded like an
argument for invasion.</TE>
<TE>   Less than two weeks later, on Sept. 7, Bush reassured Blair at
Camp David that he was set on going to the U.N. However, the rest of
the world didn't know that. And that suited Bush just fine.</TE>
<TE>   Prologue to Diplomacy</TE>
<TE>   Cheney's speech reverberated through Europe like a sonic boom.
Such uncompromising language from the vice president led some
governments to conclude that Washington had now closed off all
options but one: war.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, many of America's closest allies found themselves more
frightened about the prospects of being dragged into a U.S.-led
attack on Iraq than they were about Hussein's potential use of
weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Cirincione, director of the nonproliferation project at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, visited
Europe in mid-September. He recalls his surprise that even in
traditionally friendly capitals, he felt a genuine fear of the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   "I was shocked at how weak they felt, how compliant they were, how
frustrated they were that the United States no longer came to
consult, but to lecture," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Washington's talk of deposing Hussein also stoked angst in the
Arab world, where footage of Israeli military action against
Palestinians had become the nightly fare on evening television news.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's policy seemed to confirm the darkest of Arab suspicions:
that the United States was out to control Middle East oil, strengthen
Israel and harness Arab states into an American-controlled world.</TE>
<TE>   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak argued to nearly every leader he
met that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict posed a greater security
risk than Iraq. But he also told aides privately that Washington
wasn't listening.</TE>
<TE>   Despite these worries, rhetoric from the region softened in late
August. Arab leaders concluded that their voices were irrelevant in
Washington, and they were afraid of being on the wrong side if the
United States attacked Iraq and won.</TE>
<TE>   Still, they did try to influence events.</TE>
<TE>   Qatari Foreign Minister Sheik Hamad Jassim ibn Jaber al Thani
traveled to Baghdad in early September and reportedly raised the idea
to Hussein that he consider exile. According to credible Arab press
reports, Hussein responded with the suggestion that his guest leave
town immediately.</TE>
<TE>   According to British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, both Mubarak
and Mandela wanted to urge Hussein to comply with U.N. demands, but
failed repeatedly to even reach him by telephone.</TE>
<TE>   The reason: Hussein's well-documented obsession with secrecy and
security. Said Straw: "He thinks if he takes a phone call, then
people might find out where he is."</TE>
<TE>   Others, including the British prime minister, also were working
behind the scenes.</TE>
<TE>   Blair tried to allay the fears of his electorate. It would be a
mark of how he would conduct his diplomacy over weeks to come:
whatever the private state of British nerves over Washington's
conduct, the Blair government would keep strict solidarity with the
Bush administration in front of the cameras.</TE>
<TE>   Differences were certainly there. The British talked about
behavior change, rather than regime change, in Baghdad. London did
not accept U.S. efforts to link Hussein to the Al Qaeda terrorist
network. The British government was uncomfortable with Washington's
aggressive language and its effort to broaden the case against
Hussein to include such issues as human rights and prisoner-of-war
exchanges.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Blair's willingness to confront Hussein with a strong
resolution backed by the real threat of military force made him
America's closest partner and gave him important influence.</TE>
<TE>   Those around Blair are convinced that over time, arguments from
Powell, the senior Bush and Blair coaxed the American president to
try for a new U.N. resolution.</TE>
<TE>   The question of war and peace in Iraq was about to enter the
United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   The Opening Gambit</TE>
<TE>   Standing on the dais in the cavernous General Assembly chamber
before ambassadors and foreign ministers from 190 countries, Bush
issued his ultimatum to the United Nations. It was a challenge
carefully crafted, weeks in the making, and it would shake the U.N.
to the core.</TE>
<TE>   Both hands gripping the lectern, he declared Hussein's regime "a
grave and gathering danger," then challenged the world body to do
something about it.</TE>
<TE>   "Iraq has answered a decade of U.N. demands with a decade of
defiance," he said. "All the world now faces a test, and the United
Nations a difficult and defining moment. Are Security Council
resolutions to be honored and enforced or cast aside without
consequence? Will the United Nations serve the purpose of its
founding, or will it be irrelevant?"</TE>
<TE>   The chamber was still, the president's comments uninterrupted
until the end. And then, it was diplomatic applause -- courteous,
sustained, but not enthusiastic. It was polite cover for a range of
reactions.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with the summer of bellicose language from Washington,
Bush's appearance at the U.N. was reassuring -- as were parts of his
speech. As a gesture of goodwill, he had announced America's return
to UNESCO after an 18-year absence.</TE>
<TE>   He had also pledged to take his case against Hussein to the
Security Council for "the necessary resolutions" that would finally
hold Iraq to account for any and all weapons of mass destruction it
might have. Bush detailed a powerful case against Iraq and its
repeated defiance of earlier Security Council resolutions.</TE>
<TE>   Bush had downplayed the goal of "regime change" in Baghdad. From
the day of the U.N. speech, Bush and his aides simply stopped talking
about overthrowing Hussein. "We had to change our emphasis" to win a
majority on the Security Council, one aide said. "It doesn't mean we
abandoned regime change."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the skepticism of his audience, Bush seemed to gather
sympathy for America's central point: It was time to confront
Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   One veteran U.N. official recalled sensing a kind of euphoria that
the U.S. was not rushing directly to war against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   But the American president's words also contained a clear warning:
Failure to pass a resolution tough enough for Washington would lead
the United States to act on its own, and it would push the United
Nations to the sidelines of global diplomacy.</TE>
<TE>   Those present understood that if the United States was unable to
persuade, it would bully. If that didn't work, it would turn its back
on the world body.</TE>
<TE>   In practical terms, Bush's warnings added one more dimension to an
already complex, high-stakes debate: Every issue carried implications
far beyond its face value. When the Security Council debated how soon
Iraq should be required to reply to its demands, the question was
really whether Iraq should be given a realistic chance to comply at
all.</TE>
<TE>   When the council debated the new rules under which weapons
inspectors would work, it was also debating how onerous the terms of
Iraq's compliance should be.</TE>
<TE>   And when the council debated how to determine whether Iraq had
complied and how to decide what the U.N. should do if it did not, it
was debating not only the future of Iraq but also the role of the
Security Council in crises to come. The issue wasn't merely whether
the U.N. could disarm Hussein; it was also whether the U.N. could
restrain Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Said one French diplomat: "This is about the rules of the game in
the world today, about putting the Security Council in the center of
international life and not permitting a nation -- whatever nation it
may be -- to do what it wants, when it wants, where it wants."</TE>
<TE>   An equally intense struggle unfolded as the council's five
permanent members -- Britain, France, Russia, China and the United
States -- maneuvered to protect their own interests.</TE>
<TE>   Britain sought a U.N. stamp of legitimacy for military action
against Iraq, but it also wanted to prevent any isolation of the
United States. Russia worried about its economic and political stakes
in the Middle East, but even more about American unilateral action
and the council's credibility.</TE>
<TE>   France also sought to protect its interests. However, it was a
belief that unilateral U.S. action would be the first step toward a
might-makes-right world that led Paris to openly challenge the United
States and then lead the search for compromise.</TE>
<TE>   China, unhappy about any intervention in another country's
affairs, remained on the fringes.</TE>
<TE>   With little support or enthusiasm in the council to confront
Hussein, Washington resorted to a variety of tactics to push its hard
line. Its initial method, however, seemed to be intimidation.</TE>
<TE>   The Early Going</TE>
<TE>   Confident of its power, the United States entered the diplomatic
fray with a full head of steam.</TE>
<TE>   At the U.N., in Europe -- and in Baghdad -- a sense of despair
began to grip diplomats as expected resistance within the U.S., from
congressional Democrats, the media and a small antiwar movement,
melted.</TE>
<TE>   Within days of Bush's speech, the U.S. floated a sweeping draft
resolution that declared Iraq "in material breach" of existing U.N.
resolutions -- wording that international legal experts claimed would
justify punitive action.</TE>
<TE>   It set out demands ranging from armed escorts for inspectors to an
accounting of Iraqi-held prisoners from the 1991 Persian Gulf War and
then authorized the use of "all necessary means" should Hussein
refuse. The term is a diplomatic euphemism for an armed attack.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans knew that the draft wouldn't fly. In fact, it was
submitted in part as a sop to administration hard-liners.</TE>
<TE>   "It had everything but the kitchen sink in it," one official said.
"It was drafted by committee, and nothing got taken out."</TE>
<TE>   The response among council members was predictably negative.</TE>
<TE>   In both tone and content, they saw the U.S. draft not as a first
step toward a peaceful solution, but as a de facto declaration of
war.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of being the opening shot in a swift diplomatic
blitzkrieg, the harsh U.S. draft mobilized opposition. Almost
immediately, France countered with its own, more moderate, proposal.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Iraq drove a wedge even deeper between the United
States and other Security Council members.</TE>
<TE>   In a move that caught nearly everyone by surprise, the Iraqis
delivered a letter agreeing to let weapons inspectors return for the
first time in four years. The letter, signed by Foreign Minister Naji
Sabri, added that the U.N. inspectors were free to resume their work
"without conditions."</TE>
<TE>   The catch was that they could return under existing ground rules
that Hussein had managed to flout in the past. But several Security
Council members, eager to avoid a confrontation, seized on the offer.</TE>
<TE>   Bush had managed to put the argument against Hussein in the U.N.'s
own terms, listing resolution by resolution each measure that Iraq
had violated and the U.N.'s own failure to respond. But Iraq's
diplomatic feint slowed whatever momentum Bush had built.</TE>
<TE>   What surprised observers -- and added credibility to Sabri's
letter -- was that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, working quietly
with Arab foreign ministers and other senior diplomats, had helped
put Iraq's offer together.</TE>
<TE>   On a Monday evening, after a day of swirling rumors, Annan stepped
up to a microphone as he was leaving U.N. headquarters to welcome the
letter as "an indispensable first step" in ending the crisis. Annan's
office sent the letter to the Security Council and, half an hour
later, released it to journalists.</TE>
<TE>   In his soft-spoken way, Annan had dropped a bomb.</TE>
<TE>   Completely blindsided, the White House was furious.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials complained that Annan should have given
Washington more time before he released copies to the media. They
implied the secretary-general had been duped by a cheap propaganda
ploy. Most important, they said, Annan shouldn't have been working so
closely with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "He overstepped his bounds," one U.S. diplomat said.</TE>
<TE>   Annan, stung by criticism for what he felt was a sincere effort to
find a peaceful solution, immediately bowed out of the process.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the letter's impact was considerable. Whatever its motives,
it was a rare sign of flexibility from Baghdad and a reminder of the
new unspoken reality in the Security Council: Most members were more
frightened of the United States than of Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The incident led Washington to understand that, despite its
enormous power, the diplomatic fight at the U.N. would be no simple
walkover.</TE>
<TE>   Europeans sympathetic to Bush's approach complained that they
weren't certain of Washington's true intent. Did the Americans really
want to help the arms inspectors succeed? Or was it all a sham,
designed to lead to a war on the earliest available pretext?</TE>
<TE>   Powell and his aides understood. One aide said the lengthy debate
gave other Security Council members time to realize that the United
States would give inspections a chance.</TE>
<TE>   But there was another factor at work.</TE>
<TE>   "They also needed time for their own internal debates," the aide
said. "We were ahead of them [in deciding on a policy]. In some ways,
the debate over the resolution also became an internal debate over
policy ... in each capital. It wasn't just the guys in New York.
Going home for instructions meant that the people at home had to
wrestle with the big issues."</TE>
<TE>   Powell was walking a tightrope. He had to convince Cheney and the
other hard-liners in the administration that tougher inspections
could work. He had to convince the Europeans that the United States
was serious about giving diplomacy a chance. And he had to convince
Iraq and its defenders that the only alternative to unrestricted arms
inspections and disarmament was war.</TE>
<TE>   Thus the two protagonists in the Security Council -- the United
States and France -- had conflicting goals. The U.S. went to the U.N.
hoping to strengthen its position in case of a conflict with Iraq and
determined to preserve its freedom of action. France negotiated in
hopes of establishing some limits to U.S. power, and particularly to
deprive Bush of his freedom to attack Iraq at will. Neither fully
trusted the other.</TE>
<TE>   Some good personal chemistry helped Paris and Washington narrow
their differences. France's straight-forward foreign minister,
Dominique de Villepin, had developed an understanding and a respect
for the United States during his tour as a junior diplomat in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   At the U.N. too, French Ambassador Jean-David Levitte -- already
designated to become the next French ambassador in Washington -- and
his American counterpart, John D. Negroponte, worked closely. The
fact that both Villepin and Levitte had served as senior advisors to
French President Jacques Chirac gave them added credibility.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, it would be Britain -- historically tugged between
America and Europe -- that would bridge the "trust gap."</TE>
<TE>   Blair worked to convince the French and Russians that Bush was not
simply looking for a U.N. rubber stamp to back its goal of "regime
change," one well-placed diplomat said. But he also made it clear
that the Americans were serious about eliminating the threat of
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   His message: "This is as good as you're going to get."</TE>
<TE>   Coming Closer</TE>
<TE>   In American eyes, the French draft proposal was appallingly soft.
It contained no deadline for Iraq to formally accept the terms of a
new resolution, or a time limit for Baghdad to provide a list of
weaponry.</TE>
<TE>   It made no reference to removing existing restrictions on
inspections of sensitive sites, ignored the ideas of providing
weapons inspectors with armed escorts or allowing representatives of
the five permanent Security Council members to go along. It omitted
any provision for interviewing Iraqi scientists away from the
intimidating glare of their government.</TE>
<TE>   It also included no consequences if Hussein failed to comply,
stating only that the council should "convene immediately in order to
consider any measure to ensure full compliance ...."</TE>
<TE>   Although the initial U.S. and French drafts contained what one
diplomat called "a lot of negotiating fat" that could -- and would --
be sacrificed, they also reflected real differences.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. and French drafts had achieved what all had hoped to
avoid: They split the Security Council into two distinct camps, one
including the United States and Britain, and the other with France,
Russia, China and the majority of the council's 10 elected members.</TE>
<TE>   Although the latter group wanted to rid Hussein of any nuclear,
biological and chemical weapons, it did not want to provoke a war.
Many representatives were convinced that the existing rules for
weapons inspections were good enough. The real objective, they
argued, should be to get the inspectors back as fast as possible.</TE>
<TE>   On the morning of Oct. 3, chief U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix
addressed a deeply divided Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   Blix, a deceptively canny diplomat whose slightly disheveled
appearance masks a precise mind, had just returned from two days of
meetings in Vienna with Iraqi representatives. Council members wanted
to hear what Blix felt he needed to carry out effective inspections.</TE>
<TE>   Did he need new and tougher rules as demanded by Washington and
London? Or, with Iraqi cooperation, would his existing mandate work?</TE>
<TE>   Blix made clear that he wanted a clear mandate and a unified
Security Council. At the moment, he had neither.</TE>
<TE>   But it was Mexico's ambassador, Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, who pressed
Blix with the ultimate question. Did Blix need a new resolution? When
Blix slid off the point, Aguilar Zinser pressed again and got his
answer.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," said Blix. "A new resolution would be useful."</TE>
<TE>   According to those present, the reply seemed to shift the center
of gravity in the council.</TE>
<TE>   Washington had its first success. For France, it was time to
choose.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the popularity of their position, the French knew from the
start that they could take a stand on principle and be swept aside,
or search for common ground with Washington.</TE>
<TE>   That they chose the latter was hardly surprising. The last time
the French vetoed an American-sponsored Security Council resolution
was at the height of the Suez crisis 46 years ago. According to U.N.
legend, the French ambassador had to be locked in a closet after he
refused to cast the veto, and his deputy carried out the government's
instructions.</TE>
<TE>   In the current crisis, Paris was now ready to give the Americans
more, including its agreement on a threat to use military force if
Hussein failed to comply.</TE>
<TE>   But the U.S. would give ground too. Lots of it.</TE>
<TE>   Washington dropped the idea of sending the U.N. inspectors in with
international military backup. Blix told the Americans privately that
armed escorts would probably hamper rather than ease inspections.</TE>
<TE>   Blix also convinced hard-liners in Washington that he would take a
tough approach if inspections did get underway. He said he was glad
the United States was threatening Iraq with military action.</TE>
<TE>   "The threat of military force is the only thing that's going to
bring the Iraqis into compliance, and I need that," one of the
Americans quoted Blix as saying.</TE>
<TE>   France still wanted a second debate in the Security Council on
what consequences Iraq should face if it rejected or violated the
tough conditions in a new resolution.</TE>
<TE>   Straw and Powell came up with a possible compromise -- promising
to go back to the Security Council for discussion, but not
necessarily waiting for a second resolution. It would be enough to
have the council agree that Baghdad was in violation.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. also gave up language calling for members to use "all
necessary means" to force Hussein's compliance -- wording that would
have opened the door to war. Instead, Washington agreed to wording
that Hussein would face "serious consequences" in case of
noncompliance. For the Americans, the fuzzier language was still
broad enough to allow military action. But this, the U.S. and Britain
made clear, would be the bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   The Final Push</TE>
<TE>   The key players had agreed on what the United States considered
the main issues, but the negotiations weren't over yet.</TE>
<TE>   France and Russia still worried that buried in its wording, the
Bush administration could find the legal authority to launch military
action.</TE>
<TE>   The French thought that if the Security Council declared Iraq to
be in "material breach" of its obligations under the 1991 cease-fire
that ended the Persian Gulf War, it would be handing the United
States a license to invade.</TE>
<TE>   The United States protested that Iraq clearly was in material
breach; the Security Council had said so repeatedly in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the French replied, but we refuse to say it now if it might
become an automatic trigger for war.</TE>
<TE>   What ensued from mid-October right up to one hour before the
Security Council voted Friday was a frenzy of long-distance telephone
negotiations over just a few key words, mostly among four men:
Powell, Straw, Villepin and Russian Foreign Minister Igor S.  Ivanov.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 2, the morning of his daughter's wedding, Powell got on
the phone to Villepin to work out how the Security Council would
recognize a new "material breach" by Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The call was interrupted by Powell's wife, Alma: "Colin, get
dressed. We're going to be late."</TE>
<TE>   Powell's last conversation with Villepin that day was by cell
phone, only 20 minutes before he walked his daughter down the aisle,
an official said.</TE>
<TE>   Over the entire eight weeks of negotiations, aides calculated,
Powell made more than 150 telephone calls to foreign officials on
Iraq. "We don't have an accurate number because he's got some of
these guys, like Jack Straw, on speed dial," one aide confessed.</TE>
<TE>   "The ratio of diplomacy to actual words changed has been the
smallest I've ever seen," another aide said.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Bush and Rice were frustrated at the slow pace.
Powell reassured them that progress was being made. Still, at one
point, White House officials leaked a warning that they might demand
a quick Security Council vote -- roll the dice, win or lose -- just
to get it over with.</TE>
<TE>   The basic problem remained that the French and the Russians still
feared that the United States might point to some clause in the
resolution and interpret it as the legal authority to start a war.</TE>
<TE>   When the United States and Britain formally introduced a draft
text of the resolution Oct. 23, the French responded by circulating a
draft of their own -- and described it as a means by which the rest
of the world could restrain the out-of-control superpower.</TE>
<TE>   Then, after a few days, the French announced that they had
collected nine votes, enough to pass their version (unless, of
course, the U.S. or Britain vetoed it). The Americans fumed; the
French, their point made, backed off.</TE>
<TE>   While diplomats in New York pored line by line over the text,
looking for "traps and tricks," Powell, Straw and Villepin worked
through the larger points by telephone. They kept the Russian,
Ivanov, in the loop, although he played a less active role, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   In the last days of October, U.S. officials announced every day
that they were making progress. But they were getting worried -- not
only were Russia, France and China still resisting, but so were
countries that they thought should be in their camp by then, such as
Ireland, Mexico, Cameroon and Mauritius.</TE>
<TE>   They ratcheted up the pressure, demanding that Mauritius make its
support of the U.S. clear. When the country's soft-spoken ambassador
disappeared over the weekend -- recalled by his government -- his
absence sent a clear message.</TE>
<TE>   The United States announced that it now had two key swing votes --
Ireland and Mauritius.</TE>
<TE>   But they still weren't over the top with the two that counted
most: France and Russia.</TE>
<TE>   The next breakthrough came when British Ambassador Jeremy
Greenstock scribbled a phrase on the back of an envelope during one
negotiating session: "Final opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   The "material breach" problem could be solved if the resolution
also made it clear that Iraq could have one more chance to comply. So
a new paragraph was added, saying the council was giving Iraq "a
final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations."</TE>
<TE>   In another important step -- the one Powell worked out only
minutes before his daughter's wedding -- Villepin agreed that France
would not insist on a paragraph stating that only the council could
declare a new material breach.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans and British also were worried that Russia would
object to the provision requiring Iraq to formally accept the
resolution within seven days. They knew that clause was open to
challenge, because as a matter of law, a Security Council resolution
is automatically binding; most resolutions don't demand a formal
response.</TE>
<TE>   But the Bush administration wanted the clause in there to give
Hussein an early opportunity to reject it. To U.S. officials' relief,
the Russians did not object.</TE>
<TE>   By Tuesday -- election day in the United States -- Powell and the
foreign ministers were almost done. On Wednesday, the Americans and
British released a new draft. The text went out to all 15 delegations
in New York and all 15 of their capitals.</TE>
<TE>   But the French and the Russians still weren't comfortable.</TE>
<TE>   Over the final 48 hours, the foreign ministers changed exactly two
words. Instead of vowing to "restore" international peace, the
resolution would seek to "secure" international peace -- a way to
avoid suggesting that action needed to be taken immediately. In
another paragraph, the word "or" was changed to "and." That change
locked in the two-step process channeling complaints of Iraqi
violations and a decision on action back to the Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, Washington's willingness to give ground on that
point reassured others that the United States and Britain weren't
looking for an authorization for war. They already claimed to have
that. They were looking for international backing, they said.
Finally, the rest of the council seemed to accept it.</TE>
<TE>   Powell and Villepin took the changes to their presidents, who
approved them late Thursday afternoon, Washington time.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, Powell telephoned Ivanov to tell him that the
French had agreed.</TE>
<TE>   Ivanov "considered that to be a breakthrough that he wanted to
take to President [Vladimir V.] Putin right away," a U.S. official
said. "So at that point, I knew that the Russians were very close."</TE>
<TE>   About 9 Friday morning, Ivanov called Powell in his office at the
State Department and told him that Russia was on board. "Khorosho,
da, " the Russian told Powell -- "OK, yes." The U.S. had the votes of
14 of the 15 Security Council members, including all five permanent
members. Syria was expected to vote no; but 14 votes would be close
enough.</TE>
<TE>   A consensus, though, would be better, Annan told Syrian President
Bashar Assad by phone Friday morning. Chirac called too. If the vote
is unanimous, he said, war will be less likely.</TE>
<TE>   Only minutes before the Security Council met at 10 a.m., Syria's
Fayssal Mekdad told his American counterpart, Negroponte, that his
government had decided that it didn't want to cast the lone "no"
vote. Negroponte telephoned Powell from the hallway outside the
council chamber. Powell, delighted, informed Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The president had the prize he wanted: an international coalition
demanding that Iraq disarm, and a strong new measure of international
support if he decided to go to war.</TE>
<TE>   "The world has now come together to say that the outlaw regime in
Iraq will not be permitted to build or possess chemical, biological
or nuclear weapons," Bush said, standing in the White House Rose
Garden.</TE>
<TE>   "That is the judgment of the United States Congress, that is the
judgment of the United Nations Security Council. Now the world must
insist that that judgment be enforced."</TE>

<HD>War Preparations Escalate in Gulf</HD>
<DH>Movement of troops, equipment into region takes on new
urgency after U.N. mandate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Esther Schrader</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Pentagon has been moving ships, fighter jets, bombers and
artillery into the Persian Gulf region in preparation for a possible
war with Iraq, bolstering an already hefty force in the region.</LD>
<LD>   And the preparations, already well underway, take on new urgency
with the United Nations' decision to dispatch inspectors to Baghdad
to hunt for weapons of mass destruction.</LD>
<LD>   The resolution adopted unanimously by the Security Council on
Friday authorizes new weapons inspections in Iraq, not war. Several
council members said after their votes that they believed the
resolution will prevent war, not trigger it. President Bush, too,
said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein now has one last chance to hand
over banned weapons.</LD>
<TE>   But the president also made clear that the United States is
prepared to act as enforcer if Iraq does not comply. The New York
Times and Reuters news service reported Saturday that Bush has
approved a war plan that calls for a land, sea and air force of at
least 200,000 troops who would quickly capture footholds in the
country.</TE>
<TE>   About 48,000 U.S. military personnel and 400 aircraft are already
stationed in the Middle East and Central Asia, not counting troops
involved in the Afghanistan campaign. So much firepower is arrayed
within hours of Iraq's borders that the U.S. could launch a small
strike force backed by air power into the nation within weeks of
being told to do so by the White House.</TE>
<TE>   But current and former defense officials say that is not the
military's preferred option.</TE>
<TE>   "We could always do something right away, but the question is the
risks and whether we are willing to take them," said a retired Army
general with close ties to decision-makers at the Pentagon. "I don't
think the administration can afford to fail here. That means taking
the time, at least another month, to move more heavy forces into the
area."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the 1991 Persian Gulf War, which focused primarily on
destroying Hussein's military assets and troops, the emphasis this
time is expected to be on decapitating the Iraqi government by
targeting Hussein's institutional power base, including presidential
palaces, military and security police facilities, and bases.</TE>
<TE>   Particular attention would be given to bombing Hussein's hometown
of Tikrit.</TE>
<TE>   Many former defense officials and military analysts say an
invasion would include a large ground force of two or three Army
heavy divisions -- each of which typically includes more than 400
tanks and armored vehicles -- along with a 17,000-soldier light
division and a 45,000-member Marine expeditionary force.</TE>
<TE>   Any attack would be bolstered by large naval and air forces. The
operation probably would include intense air attacks, followed by a
combined airborne and ground assault on strategic targets, including
Iraqi air defenses and weapons sites.</TE>
<TE>   Those strikes would be carried out by cruise missiles and by
fighter planes and bombers carrying precision-guided bombs flying out
of bases in the region and from aircraft carriers.</TE>
<TE>   The armed forces have been preparing to fight Iraq again since the
Gulf War ended 11 years ago. The U.S. has maintained forces, weaponry
and supplies to equip 30,000 troops in the region. It has expanded
bases in the Persian Gulf and built new ones, and made vast
improvements in its ability to transport heavy equipment and supplies
by sea and air.</TE>
<TE>   In the last several months, the Pentagon has gone still further.
The Navy has juggled training and deployment schedules so that five
or six aircraft-carrier battle groups could be in the region in
December. The 600-strong core of the U.S. Central Command's
headquarters staff is flying out from Tampa, Fla., within weeks to
set up a new military operations center at Al Udeid Air Base in
Qatar. Supplies and state-of-the-art electronic equipment to support
that force were loaded a few weeks ago onto two fast military cargo
ships that steamed through the Suez Canal last week.</TE>
<TE>   Also making its way toward the region is a third ship, the
transport ship Bellatrix, carrying huge portable bridges capable of
transiting heavy armor and troops across the Euphrates to Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   On the British island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, hangars
are being hastily constructed for B-2 bombers, allowing the Pentagon
to station the bat-winged, radar-deflecting aircraft for the first
time overseas instead of at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   The military is "already on a glide path of being able to move
within a short time from when they are told to do so," said Clark
Murdoch, a former Air Force deputy director of strategic planning who
is now a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington. "But I imagine that with this Security Council
vote, that will accelerate. Clearly, the military is positioning
itself for the potential of going to war with Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Though the Pentagon has done what it can to obscure precisely what
it has stationed in the region, shutting down Web sites that provided
information on its resources and refusing to confirm movements of
troops and equipment observed by outsiders, the Army's stockpiles in
the region appear to have increased significantly in the last few
months.</TE>
<TE>   The Army materiel in the region includes equipment for two heavy
brigades in Kuwait and Qatar, including 230 M-1A1 Abrams tanks, 120
M-2A2 Bradley fighting vehicles, 200 armored personnel carriers, 50
mortars and 40 155-millimeter howitzers, a review of military
positioning data shows. Warehouses in Kuwait and Qatar hold enough
food and fuel to support two brigades of 5,000 troops each for a
month.</TE>
<TE>   The Marine Corps has equipment for one expeditionary brigade at
Diego Garcia, as well as for two brigades at sea.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force could fly more than 50,000 troops to the region
within a week to 10 days.</TE>
<TE>   Although this would require several hundred separate flights, the
two military air bases and one civilian airport in Kuwait could
handle the traffic.</TE>
<TE>   But to keep to the buildup schedule, Bush must soon make a
decision to call up the more than 100,000 reservists who would be
needed to augment full-time combat troops and protect military bases
overseas and at home. The troops, especially those in the National
Guard, would play an important role in protecting potential terrorist
targets in the United States, including power plants, transportation
hubs, medical centers and factories.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to send U.N. inspectors back into Iraq complicates
the military timetable. Though much of the heavy equipment recently
deployed to the Persian Gulf region probably would remain, people are
another matter.</TE>
<TE>   If troops are activated now but are idled for months while
inspections proceed, they could find themselves overstretched and
worn down from waiting in the desert by the time combat finally
begins.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials say troops sent for exercises, training or
standard duty might rotate home if it appeared that an inspection
cycle would run for a long period, with fresh troops sent in later.</TE>
<TE>   "The military has been postured for an attack as soon as early
January, but now that the inspections are going to happen, they may
actually have to delay something, or pull some people out," said
Harlan K. Ullman, a military analyst and former Navy officer.</TE>

<HD>World Sees Unanimous U.N. Vote as Triumph of Diplomacy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeffrey Fleishman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>The unanimous U.N. Security Council resolution on Iraq was hailed by
countries around the world Saturday as a diplomatic victory in which
Washington's harsh rhetoric toward Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was
tempered over months by a restrained international approach
articulated by France and Russia.</LD>
<LD>   True, Europe's left-leaning newspapers viewed the U.N. vote as a
coup for an imperialist U.S.</LD>
<LD>   "The capitulation of the world to the irresistible will of the
last emperor was total and was only slightly masked by the
requirement to go through the U.N. tollbooth before launching the
attack," said an editorial in the Rome daily La Repubblica. "George
Bush needs only to wait for Saddam Hussein to give him a pretext
within a maximum of 45 days to pull the triggers."</LD>
<TE>   But observers in many capitals saw the unanimous resolution as
proof that the U.S. could not bully the globe into an immediate war.
Russia, France, China and other Security Council members "managed to
exclude from the draft the most unacceptable wordings, including
clauses stipulating the automatic unilateral use of force," said Yuri
Fedotov, Russia's deputy foreign minister. "Most important is that a
compromise has been achieved and the international community has
prevented a real threat of war."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, expecting to win one or two vetoes and a handful of
abstentions, Baghdad was left with no supporting voice on the
Security Council. Even Syria, a Muslim neighbor, voted for the
resolution. The result was a testament not only to U.S. global
influence but to the fact that many nations -- after a recent bombing
on the Indonesian island of Bali and a hostage crisis at a Moscow
theater -- are increasingly alarmed by terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   China's yes vote, for example, came as a surprise to some
diplomats who had expected the country to abstain, just as it did in
a similar vote in the run-up to the 1991 Persian Gulf War. But a
desire not to upset relations with the U.S., especially after
President Jiang Zemin's recent visit to President Bush's ranch in
Texas, apparently nudged Beijing to support the resolution. So did a
wish to be considered a key player on the world stage.</TE>
<TE>   Like most nations, however, China warned that the resolution does
not give the U.S. carte blanche for military action.</TE>
<TE>   "We would like to stress that the Security Council shoulder the
responsibility for safeguarding international peace and security,"
said Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's acceptance of the resolution was partly influenced by
last month's hostage standoff with Chechen rebels, which ended in
about 120 deaths. The crisis was Russia's psychological equivalent to
the Sept. 11 attacks in the U.S. and emboldened the Kremlin to widen
its war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "The positions of the Kremlin and the White House have grown
visibly closer," said Igor M. Klyamkin, director of the Institute of
Sociological Analysis in Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   Arab governments -- many of which privately support the overthrow
of Hussein -- reacted to the U.N. resolution with relief. They saw it
as a triumph for months of diplomacy waged by the 22-member Arab
League and as a defeat for U.S. policies.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a victory for reason and a victory for attempts to defuse
a dangerous situation in a region already pregnant with tension,"
said Nabil Osman, spokesman for Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.</TE>
<TE>   "The vote was a victory for the U.N. and a setback for America's
go-it-alone attitudes," said Jamal Kashoggi, deputy editor of the
Arab News in Jidda, Saudi Arabia. "Now the Arabs are happy. Everyone
is happy except Saddam Hussein."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Japan and Germany are wondering how they will respond if
war becomes inevitable. Japan's constitution forbids the offensive
use of military force, although defining what that means is a game of
semantics. The country struggles with deep internal divisions over
the role of the military and with the concerns of wary Asian
neighbors whose territory it occupied during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese newspapers suggested that Tokyo would balk at sending its
sophisticated Aegis-equipped destroyer to the Persian Gulf, a move
viewed as too aggressive. And in a meeting Friday with U.S.
Undersecretary of Defense Douglas J. Feith, Tokyo apparently hedged
its bets. Vice Foreign Minister Yukio Takeuchi was quoted as saying
Japan would delay its decision.</TE>
<TE>   In Germany, meanwhile, the unanimous U.N. vote was causing
"legitimacy" problems for the government, according to politicians
and commentators.</TE>
<TE>   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder won reelection in September in large
part because he tapped into German pacifism by saying he would refuse
to send troops into a war with Iraq. Now, with a strongly worded
resolution that could result in an invasion, Germany seems to be
standing isolated from the club of major powers. What's more, this
comes two months before Germany is scheduled to take a seat as a
nonpermanent member of the Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a great success for U.S. and French diplomacy," said
Friedbert Pfluger, an opposition member of Parliament. "The
resolution offers tough language and a clear last warning to Saddam
Hussein.... It is sad to think that Germany did not participate, did
not play a role at all. The German government will have to rethink
its position."</TE>
<TE>   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, the Bush administration's
trusted ally, strengthened his hand over the course of the U.N.
debate. Early on he endorsed military action against Hussein and was
lampooned in the British media as "Washington's poodle." But in
recent days, he has been credited with having convinced Bush to
compromise on the resolution's wording.</TE>
<TE>   In any event, the unanimous resolution was a powerful symbol of
world unity, according to many diplomats and political leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that you have a general agreement really leaves Saddam
Hussein with very little chance of finding any kind of justification
on the international level," said Franco Pavoncello, a political
scientist at John Cabot University in Rome. "This is a success for
France and for Britain, but it is also a result of the willingness by
the United States to take a more international approach."</TE>

development are eyeing to buy the grazing land near Calabasas and
preserve it.</LD>
<LD>   Proposition 50 earmarks at least $300 million for protecting
watersheds and wetlands in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, and
includes $40 million for the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, the
state agency that acquires parkland in the area.</LD>
<LD>   Supporters of the idea said that using the bond money to buy
Ahmanson Ranch meets the law because the land drains into Malibu
Creek, which flows through the Santa Monica Mountains National
Recreation Area and into Santa Monica Bay.</LD>
<TE>   Assemblywoman Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills), who was reelected
Tuesday, said she will work to build support in Sacramento for
putting Proposition 50 money toward buying the 2,800-acre ranch.</TE>
<TE>   "What a wonderful legacy for the state if we could do this,"
Pavley said.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the $2-billion, 3,050-home subdivision have been
trying for months to persuade owner Washington Mutual to sell the
land to the public or enjoy a sizable tax break by donating it to a
conservation agency.</TE>
<TE>   They say they could have pieced together an attractive bid even
before Proposition 50's passage, but the bond puts them closer to
their goal.</TE>
<TE>   "We are asking [Washington Mutual] to come to the table and sell
this at a fair price to the state of California so it can forever be
preserved as parkland," said Chad Griffin, spokesman for the
organization Rally to Save Ahmanson Ranch.</TE>
<TE>   The group encouraged its allies to support Proposition 50, which
was formally titled the "Water Security, Clean Drinking Water,
Coastal and Beach Protection Act of 2002."</TE>
<TE>   The group's co-chairman, Chris Albrecht, an HBO executive,
contributed $20,000 to back the ballot measure. It passed 55% to 45%.</TE>
<TE>   Estimates of how much money it would take to buy the ranch range
from $100 million to as much as $500 million.</TE>
<TE>   Washington Mutual, a Seattle-based bank, has repeatedly insisted
it wants to start building homes and that it isn't interested in
selling its land.</TE>
<TE>   "We are now focused completely on building a new community, the
Ahmanson Ranch community, in an area where there is a strong
imbalance of jobs over housing," spokesman Tim McGarry said.</TE>
<TE>   "Prop. 50 was about water, and Ahmanson is not just about water,"
said state Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica), who favors preserving
the ranch. "It's about traffic and it's about land use and it's about
air pollution" as well as water.</TE>
<TE>   So a hodgepodge of funding sources, including the Proposition 40
parks and natural resources bond from March, might be more
appropriate, she said. Whether the latest bond applies to Ahmanson
Ranch is moot, Kuehl said, if Washington Mutual refuses to be a
"willing seller," as the law requires.</TE>
<TE>   Given the expected competition for Proposition 50 money among
agencies and nonprofit groups, spending tens of millions, if not
hundreds of millions, on the Ahmanson parcel might not make sense,
said Mike Spear, deputy secretary for land conservation and
stewardship at California's Resources Agency.</TE>
<TE>   "If you do Ahmanson, there's a whole bunch of stuff that's not
going to get done elsewhere," Spear said. "We're very concerned about
one project taking all of the funding for an area."</TE>
<TE>   Joe Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains
Conservancy, said he would like to participate in a state purchase of
Ahmanson Ranch for parkland.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're eager for a solution to the problem," he said. "And
we certainly would be in a position to try to help if we had a
willing seller. But I've not received any communications from
Washington Mutual's representatives. They know my e-mail. They know
my home number."</TE>

<TE>   Even some of those who have fought over the last decade to block
the construction of homes on the rolling hills and oak savannas at
Ahmanson say they think the new bond money may not be suited for

<TE>   But any expenditure of Proposition 50 money on Ahmanson, Edmiston
said, would compete with such high-profile projects as the
preservation of wetlands at both Playa Vista in Los Angeles and near
Bolsa Chica State Beach in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County planners are reviewing a new environmental study of
the Ahmanson Ranch development and could forward the study to county
supervisors for review next month.</TE>
<TE>   Concerned that the 8,000-person community project will further
clog area streets and freeways, Los Angeles city officials have
threatened to sue their neighboring county if Ventura County
supervisors allow the project to proceed.</TE>

<HD>Transit Center Is Back on Track</HD>
<DH>Anaheim resumes work on regional rail and bus station,
which would double as county cultural center. Maglev terminal is part
of plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Weikel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On paper, Anaheim's $250-million transportation center is a palace
for mobility: Cavernous interlocking stations with arching roofs of
glass serving tens of thousands of people a day.</LD>
<LD>   Metrolink, Amtrak, a maglev train to Las Vegas, the state's
high-speed rail project, and the county's CenterLine system are shown
converging as if all tracks lead to Anaheim. Designed like a giant
layer cake, the station will allow trains to come and go from tiers.</LD>
<LD>   Outside are transit ways and bus bays, bicycle racks, ample
parking and easy access to the Orange and Santa Ana freeways. Edison
International Field, the Arrowhead Pond and new office buildings --
so-called transit-oriented development -- surround the complex,
dubbed the Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center.
Disneyland is just a few shuttle stops away.</LD>
<TE>   Shelved for almost a decade as too much, too soon, the center is
dormant no longer. Anaheim has resumed planning Orange County's
version of New York's Grand Central Station. Along with Ontario
International Airport and Union Station in downtown Los Angeles, the
Anaheim transit hub is envisioned as one of three fully integrated
hubs connecting the sprawling Southland metropolis.</TE>
<TE>   Although hurdles remain, city leaders believe a regional transit
center will be necessary to Orange County's tourist industry, job
market and population growth. Work must proceed today to accommodate
transit demands 10 to 20 years from now, officials say. "We want and
need better access to grow and prosper economically, not just in
Anaheim, but across the region," said Gary Johnson, the city's
director of public works.</TE>
<TE>   Planners want to build the complex in a notch of land formed by
the Orange Freeway and the Santa Ana River. The site lies mostly on
city and county property immediately northeast of Edison Field and
just south of Katella Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   City officials say the site will be designed to accommodate five
types of rail lines and a variety of buses services -- from shuttles
to express routes -- on specially designed transit ways.</TE>
<TE>   Motorists would be able to reach the transit center from the
Orange and Santa Ana freeways. Parking would be available in a large
structure, in nearby lots and at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great idea to put the various modes of transportation in
one location," said Kristi Kimball of the Surface Transportation
Policy Foundation, a Washington think tank. "Intermodalism is far
more convenient for travelers."</TE>
<TE>   High-density office, residential and commercial buildings,
restaurants, cinemas, clubs and shops would be encouraged around it.
Amenities are available near major train stations around the country,
often transforming them into focal points for travelers and people in
surrounding communities.</TE>
<TE>   "Stations can be huge attractions," said Sarah L. Catz, director
of the Center for Urban Infrastructure at UC Irvine's Institute for
Transportation Studies. "I have seen what they've done to Union
Station in Washington, D.C., and Grand Central Station in New York.
If ARTIC is created, it could be a wonderful cultural center for
Orange County."</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim's transit hub has a long way to go from renderings to
reality. The station depends on rail systems that have yet to be
approved or face serious economic hurdles.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak, the national passenger service, is struggling financially,
although it recently received a transfusion of federal funds to keep
it going.</TE>
<TE>   Maglev, or magnetically levitated trains, can go 200 to 300 mph
but are expensive and unproven commercially. Japan and Germany have
experimented with them for decades but have not put any into service.</TE>
<TE>   City officials would like Anaheim to be a terminus for the
proposed California-Nevada Super Speed Train, a $4-billion maglev
route that would link the city with Ontario International Airport and
Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   The so-called "Gambler's Special" was proposed almost 20 years
ago. The project's commission is now seeking federal funds for
environmental studies. If everything falls into place, the system
might be built by 2008.</TE>
<TE>   Rail enthusiasts are eagerly awaiting the world's first commercial
application of maglev technology. The Chinese government is building
a $2-billion, 18-mile line from Shanghai's main business district to
a new international airport.</TE>
<TE>   Uncertainty also surrounds the $25-billion California High Speed
Rail Project, the state's version of the bullet train. In November
2004, voters will be asked to approve a $9-billion segment from San
Francisco to Los Angeles. Even if that first leg is approved, Anaheim
might have to wait years to be included in subsequent phases of the
project. Overall plans call for high-speed rail links from San Diego
to San Francisco and Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "If they can pull it off, it would be a fantastic, world-class
center," said David Elbaum, director of strategic planning for the
Orange County Transportation Authority. "But in our thinking, you
clearly will need CenterLine, high-speed rail service and Metrolink
to make it work."</TE>
<TE>   Trouble is, except for a mention of CenterLine in the plans for
the transit center, the county's proposed light rail line is all but
dead in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Several years ago city officials negotiated with OCTA over a route
to Anaheim, but those talks failed. Then, the Orange City Council,
concerned about the proposed route, voted against light rail.</TE>
<TE>   Since then OCTA has scaled back the initial leg of the project to
11 miles from 30 miles. As it now stands, the line would go from UC
Irvine to Santa Ana's transportation center.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of uncertainty," said Hasan Ikhrata, director of
planning and policy for the Southern California Assn. of Governments,
which supports Anaheim's plan. "But if we are serious about having
alternatives to motor vehicles, this has to happen."</TE>
<TE>   If high-speed rail is approved and the Anaheim transit hub is
built, Ikhrata predicted the combination would provide substantial
incentives for travelers to get out of their cars and onto trains and
buses. He noted that only 2% of trips made in the region are on
public transit.</TE>
<TE>   "The $250-million cost is a question," Ikhrata said. But "if we do
it well, the return could be quite substantial."</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim shelved the proposal about 10 years ago when the
California High Speed Rail Project and the maglev train from Anaheim
to Las Vegas were making little progress.</TE>
<TE>   City officials resumed planning because the state decided to put
the high-speed rail question to voters, and because several maglev
projects are underway. In addition to the Chinese project, the
federal government is weighing a demonstration maglev line on the
East Coast. The finalists are a route in Pennsylvania and a line
linking Baltimore and Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim officials so far have spent about $500,000 on the transit
center and have held meetings with local and federal legislators.
They plan to ask the federal government for about $250 million next
fall.</TE>
<TE>   "The timing is better now," Assistant City Manager Thomas Wood
said. "We need to be more aggressive. You are not going to see the
freeways widened through this city again."</TE>

<HD>Phones Blamed in More Crashes</HD>
<DH>CHP chief backs bill allowing drivers only hands-free
devices after learning the agency may have vastly understated the
problem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ray F. Herndon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The CHP has pulled back a report to legislators on the role of mobile
phones in traffic accidents after learning it may have drastically
understated the problem.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, California Highway Patrol commissioner Dwight O.
"Spike" Helmick said he has changed his view and now believes
California should permit drivers to use only hands-free equipment.
Such a bill is being introduced next month in the Legislature for the
third time.</LD>
<LD>   "I must tell you I advocated against the mandatory hands-free cell
phone bill, thinking that it [cell phone distraction] wasn't a
problem," Helmick said last week.</LD>
<TE>   "But I have changed my view after looking at the data. I was
absolutely amazed at how high the cellular phone [accident rate] was.
There is an easy fix for this, and that is requiring equipment that
would make it hands-free."</TE>
<TE>   The report, which has not been made public, was ordered last year
by the Legislature to inform its debate about mobile phone use by
drivers. New York -- like 22 countries -- requires that phones in
vehicles be hands-free; other states are considering similar laws.</TE>
<TE>   But the report counted only 913 accidents in 2001 for which police
officers across California indicated that cell phone use was to
blame. Three of those accidents involved fatalities, and 423 caused
injuries.</TE>
<TE>   A Times analysis of statewide traffic accident data showed that
the total would be far higher if it included all accidents in which
the driver responsible for the crash was using a cell phone. Officers
began collecting these numbers in April 2001, Helmick said, at the
urging of the Automobile Club of Southern California. These figures
show that at least 4,699 accidents were blamed on drivers using cell
phones, and that those accidents killed 31 people and injured 2,786.</TE>
<TE>   Because the data producing the higher figures were collected for
only nine months of 2001, the number of accidents involving cell
phones could be well over 6,000 for the full year.</TE>
<TE>   The report was sent to Gov. Gray Davis last week for his approval
before being released to the Legislature. Helmick said it was pulled
back so that CHP statistics brought to his attention by The Times
could be included.</TE>
<TE>   Helmick said the reworked report would include data showing that
drivers using cell phones had been blamed for nearly seven times the
number of accidents that the CHP had originally cited in its report.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not changing any of our conclusions. It's just adding
additional data that might make it clearer for everybody," Helmick
said.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear why so many officers did not fill in the appropriate
box on their accident reports for cellular-phone distraction when the
driver responsible for the crash was using one at the time.</TE>
<TE>   They may have been discouraged from making that judgment by
instructions from the CHP: "The activity should be verified by [a]
witness, involved party statements, and/or physical evidence before
documented as an associated factor [driver distraction in causing an
accident]."</TE>
<TE>   Chief Stan Perez of the CHP's enforcement division said the
report, as originally drafted, did not include statistics showing all
accidents blamed on drivers using cell phones because investigators
had not made a connection between cell phone use and the accident's
cause in every case.</TE>
<TE>   The statistical problem is illustrated by accident reports
submitted by CHP officers who patrol the Santa Monica and San
Bernardino freeways, from Santa Monica to the San Bernardino County
line. They investigated 1,242 accidents involving drivers using cell
phones, blamed 590 of those accidents on cell phone-using drivers,
and then reported that driver distraction because of cell phone use
was a contributing factor in only two of those accidents.</TE>
<TE>   "Without a doubt, there's something wrong there," Helmick said.
"Clearly the numbers do not look right, nor do I think they're
right."</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Karl Schuler of the Costa Mesa Police Department, whose
accident investigators reported more drivers distracted by cell
phones than any other police jurisdiction in the state, scoffed at
the lower figures reported by much larger cities.</TE>
<TE>   "In all of Los Angeles, there were only 28 accidents blamed on
cell phone inattention last year, while we had 60 in Costa Mesa.
C'mon," he said. "I can guarantee you that in ... these other big
cities, there were a lot more than what they're showing up with. And
it's probably because the officers aren't putting it on [their
reports]."</TE>
<TE>   The CHP report could determine the fate of a bill prohibiting
California drivers from using hand-held cell phones, a bill that
Assemblyman Joe Simitian (D-Palo Alto) said he will introduce next
month. It died on 10-9 votes in the Assembly's transportation
committee in the last two sessions of the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Simitian welcomed Helmick's change of heart -- "I think that's
good news" -- and expressed hope that his bill would pass and be
signed into law next year.</TE>
<TE>   "I have argued from the outset that this bill ... will save lives.
And if the data [are] now so compelling as to bring new support to
the bill, I'm nothing but delighted."</TE>

<HD>Cyber Crime Fighters Escape Funding Cut</HD>
<DH>Thousands of high-tech crimes confront law enforcement,
including an intrusion into the state controller's computer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Overend</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>California's computer crime force was on the chopping block. It was
May, and state budget cutters were threatening the five regional
investigative squads with a 30% slash in funding.</LD>
<LD>   Then came disclosure of a high-tech crime close to home at
Sacramento's Teale Data Center: A hacker had accessed the state
controller's computer, which holds the Social Security numbers of
265,000 state employees, including Gov. Gray Davis.</LD>
<LD>   As investigators followed the trail, they discovered computer
intrusion on a global scale. By hacking into a computer server known
as "Godzilla," the intruder had gained access to nearly every state
computer in California. Systems in 156 countries had also been
cracked, including those of more than 1,000 businesses and agencies
in the United States.</LD>
<TE>   The complex case, still unsolved, is just one of thousands of
computer crimes confronting California law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the breach at the Teale Data Center influenced the
Legislature, no one wants to say. But the 30% cut was eliminated,
despite the state's continuing budget crunch. A spokesman for the
governor's office of criminal justice planning said last week that
full funding would continue for the state's high-technology crime
investigators.</TE>
<TE>   "The task forces will be funded at the same level as the previous
year's funding," said the spokesman, Tim Herrera. "There has been
speculation about cuts, but the governor sees this as an area that
needs funding so these cyber cops can do their jobs."</TE>
<TE>   State Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer believes that even more computer
investigators are required.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to dramatically expand these operations," said Lockyer.
"If we doubled them in size, that might be a start.... This is the
fastest-growing crime in America."</TE>
<TE>   From the most violent murders to the most common frauds, police
and prosecutors increasingly find that high-tech detective work is
now a necessary part of almost every investigation. Even if a
computer is not used to commit a crime, it still can hold valuable
evidence in its memory.</TE>
<TE>   "The computer takes away what I call the moral speed bumps," said
Deputy Atty. Gen. Robert Morgester, who helped start the state task
force system. "Like stalking somebody. Without a computer, you have
to leave your house and do it yourself. Now you can do it right in
your home."</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, the state had only one high-tech criminal
investigator. Today there are 167 from state, federal and local
agencies. Together, they receive about $13 million from the state and
similar amounts from local funding and grants.</TE>
<TE>   Just as the state has beefed up its resources, the FBI has made
cyber crime an increasingly important priority. Larger police
agencies have done the same. And the Secret Service recently
announced the opening of new task forces in Los Angeles and San
Francisco, aimed primarily at protecting banking and other financial
infrastructures from cyber terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Some computer-based swindles net tens of millions of dollars; some
hit hundreds or thousands of people for small amounts each. Some
people use computers to stalk and terrorize. Many more use them for
sexual exploitation, especially of children.</TE>
<TE>   People using computers can counterfeit everything from bank checks
to high-quality $100 bills. A Social Security or credit card number
is often all a criminal needs to clean somebody out.</TE>
<TE>   Altogether, according to state statistics through June 2001, in
just two years, 410,000 people were affected by cyber crime. The
amount known to have been lost by companies and individuals
approaches $333 million.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, the San Diego task force was called to help solve a
Riverside County case that had court officials puzzled. Employees had
noticed that bail amounts had been reduced to zero in some cases and
future court dates had been deleted.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators logged on to the computer system and began watching
it around the clock, said the task force leader, Michael Groch.</TE>
<TE>   "The investigators could see the suspect activity while it was
taking place," Groch said. "Eventually, it turned out to involve a
man with considerable computer skills."</TE>
<TE>   According to investigators, Brandon Wilson and William Grace
cracked into the county's court computer system 72 times, altering
Wilson's records and those of four other people to make it appear
that their cases had been closed.</TE>
<TE>   Charges included possession of illegal drugs and weapons, failure
to appear in court, driving under the influence, and manufacturing
and importing weapons. Officials say Wilson changed the records to
show that the charges had been dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson also changed drug and gun charges for one woman, and
traffic charges for a man, investigators said. Wilson also was
charged with altering the records of an accused embezzler and another
man charged with driving under the influence.</TE>
<TE>   Facing 216 felony counts each since their arrest in June, Wilson
and Grace have pleaded not guilty and await trial in Riverside
County.</TE>
<TE>   Morgester said one problem in past computer crime cases has been a
history of light sentences. In addition, many prosecutors are
reluctant to pursue them because they are often complex and pose
difficult jurisdictional problems. A criminal can touch victims
thousands of miles away.</TE>
<TE>   "An old adage in law enforcement is, 'If it doesn't bleed, it
isn't a crime,' " Morgester said.</TE>
<TE>   As with the state's other task forces in San Jose, Napa, Los
Angeles and San Diego, the Sacramento office is a mix of top
electronics experts and cops pulled from other duties.</TE>
<TE>   On a Tuesday morning, Sacramento County Sheriff's Det. Dave
Wright, assigned to a federally funded program on Internet crimes
against children, said thousands of chat rooms focus on child porn.</TE>
<TE>   "Computers are great for business, but they are wrecking our
society," Wright said. "Child porn is as common as speeding on the
freeway."</TE>
<TE>   The range of cyber cases is just as broad for the Southern
California High Tech Task Force in Norwalk, led by Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Deputy Rick Craigo.</TE>
<TE>   "One of our biggest cases was counterfeit software coming in from
Taiwan," Craigo said. "We received information last November from
Microsoft and [the] U.S. Customs [Service] that it was arriving. We
arrested the chief suspect the same day, and ultimately wound up with
$100 million in counterfeit software of Microsoft and Symantec
products. The chief suspect here faces a possible sentence of up to
nine years."</TE>
<TE>   Such cases are only the most visible types of cyber crime,
however, Craigo said.</TE>
<TE>   "By Dec. 31 this year, we estimate we will have 12,000 identity
theft cases in Los Angeles alone. We have 11 investigators to handle
them," Craigo said.</TE>
<TE>   But even as cyber crime investigators scratch for more money, they
speak of the need for U.S. businesses and private citizens to take a
more critical view of the personal information now being routinely
gathered on every citizen.</TE>
<TE>   "Ask yourself: Does your dentist really need to know your Social
Security number?" said Lt. Mike Tsuchida of the Sacramento task
force. "Do all those businesses out there really need all the
information they gather now? Should you be giving it so freely?"</TE>
<TE>   Much the same point is made by those on the academic side of the
issue. Fred Cotton, director of a national computer training center
based in Sacramento, said government and businesses need to rethink
their information-gathering processes.</TE>
<TE>   "We really need to think about how we can be more cautious," he
said. "The public needs to question this too. The bad guys are taking
advantage of home systems. Most people need to protect themselves
better."</TE>

<HD>Dame Felicity Peake, 89; Led Peacetime Women's Air Force</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dame Felicity Peake, one of the British heroines of World War II who
became the first leader of the peacetime Women's Royal Air Force, has
died at the age of 89.</LD>
<LD>   Peake, who had homes in London and Oxfordshire, died Nov. 2 in
London.</LD>
<LD>   Dashing and attractive in uniform, Peake was one of two women
painted for widely circulated recruiting posters, and her face became
easily recognized early in the war.</LD>
<TE>   During the Battle of Britain in the summer of 1940, she was second
in command of 250 Women's Auxiliary Air Force members at Biggin Hill,
the most heavily attacked Royal Air Force base in England.</TE>
<TE>   Describing one Luftwaffe attack on Aug. 30, 1940, in her 1993
memoirs, "Pure Chance," Peake wrote: "The vibration and blast were
such that one felt that one's limbs must surely come apart. Bombs
fell pretty continuously, the noise was indescribable.... "</TE>
<TE>   Emerging from her own trench to check on her troops during a lull
in the bombing, Peake saw one of her "girls" fatally wounded. "She
was the first dead person I had ever seen. I remember thinking I must
have a good look at her as I might have to get used to this sort of
thing," she wrote more than half a century later. "I was relieved
that my reactions were, at least, controllable."</TE>
<TE>   Actress Susannah York portrayed Peake in the 1969 movie "Battle of
Britain" about the British forces that prevented Nazi invasion.</TE>
<TE>   Born Felicity Hyde Watts to a textile firm family in Cheadle
Hulme, Cheshire, England, Peake grew up fascinated with airplanes.
When she married brewery scion John "Jock" Hanbury in 1935, they gave
each other flying lessons as a wedding present. Peake soloed after
only 6 1/2 hours in the air.</TE>
<TE>   In 1938, with war between Britain and Germany imminent, she went
to Chelsea Barracks to join the women's auxiliary to the Royal Air
Force -- only to be rejected. Her Paris finishing school, she was
told, had not equipped her for the needed engine repair or telephone
communications.</TE>
<TE>   Persistent, Peake persuaded authorities to enlist her after
demonstrating that she owned a motorcycle and repaired it herself.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband also enlisted, but Hanbury was killed in 1939 when his
plane crashed on a night training exercise.</TE>
<TE>   After the Battle of Britain, Peake was transferred to Air Ministry
Headquarters as the first women's auxiliary public relations officer.
There she met her second husband, Air Commodore (later Sir) Harald
Peake, then director of RAF public relations. They married in 1952,
and he died in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   She continued to rise in rank and duties. At war's end in 1946,
she became director of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force at 33. She led
the transition of the wartime auxiliary into a permanent unit of the
British forces and became the first head of the Women's Royal Air
Force when it was established in 1949.</TE>
<TE>   That year, she was also made a dame of the British Empire and soon
retired to become an executive director of her first husband's family
brewery, Truman Hanbury &amp; Buxton.</TE>
<TE>   Although her remarkable military career lasted only one decade,
Peake remained active on the executive committees of the Imperial War
Museum and in the RAF Benevolent Fund, to which she gave proceeds
from her autobiography. Peake also served as a trustee of St. Clement
Danes, the RAF Church in London.</TE>
<TE>   She is survived by her son, Andrew Peake.</TE>

<HD>Excuse for Teens to Forgo Drugs</HD>
<DH>High schools' voluntary random-testing program lets the
students fight peer pressure and 'maintain their coolness.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claire Luna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a golf cart ferried him from physics class to the office, Matt
Nejad thought his frequent tardies finally had caught up with him.
Instead, the lanky San Clemente High School senior found himself
urinating into a plastic cup.</LD>
<LD>   Five minutes later, he was back in class, having snagged a
fleeting reprieve from his studies and confirmation for his parents
that he's drug-free.</LD>
<LD>   San Clemente High's unusual voluntary random-testing program is
part of a new -- and much-debated -- approach to fighting teen drug
use.</LD>
<TE>   Most schools conduct drug tests as a condition of participating in
extracurricular activities or in exchange for rewards. Testing at San
Clemente -- where about 1,000 students participate -- and at two
other southern Orange County high schools is different.</TE>
<TE>   Results are known only to the student and parents; neither school
officials nor police are notified if a test result is positive for
drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Principal Charles Hinman and his counterparts at Laguna Beach and
Trabuco Hills high schools say the program protects teenagers from
peer pressure, empowering students to just say no and still be cool.</TE>
<TE>   Students enrolled in such programs -- and those who want to
pretend they are -- have an excuse at parties to pass on smoking a
joint or snorting a line of cocaine, saying they would but their
parents have signed them up for drug testing.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the middle-of-the-road kids are looking for a reason to
say no and still maintain their coolness," said Robert DuPont,
president of the Institute for Behavior and Health and the first
director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "Drug testing gives them an out."</TE>
<TE>   Administrators believe the program's voluntary nature -- parents
enroll their children for testing at the beginning of the school year
-- allows them to skirt sensitive privacy concerns. Although some
students and parents have questioned the efficacy and logic of a
program that has no school- or law enforcement-related consequences,
Hinman said testing tries to address drug use in a deeper way.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the purest moral effort to help kids say no," he said. "When
there is no punishment, there can be no confusion. All we're trying
to get out of this program is a tool against peer pressure if kids
want it, and treatment if kids need it."</TE>
<TE>   A study by the University of Michigan found that 54% of U.S. teens
surveyed said they had tried an illicit drug by the time they
finished high school, with 6% of seniors reporting daily marijuana
use. The same study showed that those students who had used drugs
were less likely to go to college and more likely to drop out.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, schools have a responsibility to help parents
intervene before the problem escalates, many education and law
enforcement officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "Oftentimes, parents only find out their kids use drugs when we've
arrested them for stealing or prostitution or they're in the hospital
with an overdose," said Sgt. Roger Neumeister, who heads the Orange
County Sheriff's Department's Juvenile Services Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   The Drug and Alcohol Testing Industry Assn. estimates about 500
public school districts nationwide have some sort of drug-testing
program at one or more of their schools. The vast majority require
testing for students involved in athletics or certain other
extracurricular activities.</TE>
<TE>   Only about 15 districts nationally offer voluntary programs open
to all students. Some of those, however, offer tangible incentives to
boost participation -- such as discounts for school dances or
backpack patches.</TE>
<TE>   The school board of the Dublin Unified district in Northern
California, for example, is considering a voluntary program that
would give gold stars and discounts at local businesses to those who
enroll.</TE>
<TE>   Principals of the three Orange County schools, which are among a
handful that have voluntary programs without incentives, say such
visible markers of participation make it impossible for students not
enrolled in the program to use it as an excuse to refuse drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Some educators, however, argue that a testing program available to
all students is perilously close to requiring every child to be
tested -- a step that inevitably would bring invasion-of-privacy
lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Those lawsuits are less likely if parental consent is required,
"but it's better to have it as a formal program tied to something
concrete like extracurricular activities so that no student can
quibble with their right to refuse to take the test," said Edwin
Darden, senior staff attorney for the National School Boards Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Other critics say the voluntary testing program neglects the
rights of students. Peter Eliasberg, managing attorney for the
American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, praised the
programs for the punishment-free approach to dealing with teen drug
use. But he cautioned that parental consent should be irrelevant if
the students themselves do not want to be tested.</TE>
<TE>   "If they said free speech at school is banned if parents consent,
there would be an uproar," he said. "That consent doesn't get around
student rights."</TE>
<TE>   The largest trial of a program similar to those in Orange County
was in Miami, where high schools offered off-campus testing for
randomly selected students. It ended in 1999 after six months because
only a few dozen enrolled.</TE>
<TE>   For some schools, paying for a drug-testing program -- which will
cost San Clemente High an estimated $10,000 a year -- is an issue.
Los Angeles Unified spokeswoman Cricket Bauer said it would be
difficult for strapped urban districts such as hers to consider
launching programs not directly related to academic improvement.</TE>
<TE>   Schools in affluent suburban regions such as Orange County have an
advantage over urban districts in that community support is easier to
mobilize, Darden said. Across the country in suburban Long Island,
the Glen Cove School District is considering a voluntary testing
program that already has strong backing among parents.</TE>
<TE>   "Some districts are so sprawling it would be impossible to ever
arrive at a consensus about something as divisive as drug testing,"
he said. "Parents in suburban schools have a tendency to trust
whatever the district recommends and the time to back it actively and
make sure it succeeds."</TE>
<TE>   Participation at San Clemente ranges from 55% of freshmen to 20%
of seniors. Of the 70 tests completed there this year, one student
has refused to take the test and four have tested positive for
marijuana use.</TE>
<TE>   At Trabuco Hills and Laguna Beach high schools, where school
officials do not even see summaries of test results, principals said
they do not know how many students have enrolled.</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente senior Lesley Navarro doubts the program reaches the
students who need it most, saying that kids she knows with serious
drug problems often lack parents who are interested in their welfare.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the kids that are signed up for it aren't the ones doing
[drugs]," said Navarro, who is enrolled in the testing program. "My
friends who do drugs said they never turned it in, or put 'No' and
forged their parents' signature."</TE>
<TE>   Others, such as senior Andrew Kartunen, say tests will provide a
wake-up call to those parents who mistakenly assume their children
don't use drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of parents think their kids are perfect," he said. "If I
were a parent, this would be a service the school provides that would
let me know for sure if they used drugs or not."</TE>
<TE>   For each test at San Clemente, the testing company's computer
randomly selects students, who are called out of class and brought to
the health office by golf cart, both to expedite transportation at
the sprawling campus and ensure they don't stop anywhere first to
snag a clean sample.</TE>
<TE>   Tests are given nearly every four weeks, and the 30 or so students
chosen must use the office bathrooms, where sinks are plastic-wrapped
and with trash cans removed so kids can't water down their samples or
leave clean ones for fellow test-takers.</TE>
<TE>   The testing company tells parents of negative results by phone the
same day. If the results are positive, parents are notified by mail
and given counseling referrals and paperwork for the child to take a
suggested follow-up test at company headquarters to determine
frequency of use. A school psychologist also is available if parents
want free counseling for the student.</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente pays for the program with funds from school support
groups and a state safety grant. At Trabuco Hills and at Laguna Beach
High, parents return permission slips with $30 checks for the testing
fee.</TE>
<TE>   Many San Clemente parents have embraced the voluntary approach,
saying it has sparked greater communication.</TE>
<TE>   "We have talked about drugs several times because of this
program," said Peggy Griffin, whose son Stephen, a senior, is signed
up. "I credit this program for that because we had never talked about
drugs before."</TE>
<TE>   Back on campus, as Matt Nejad washed his hands after being tested,
he said he hadn't even thought about the program since turning in his
permission slip in September.</TE>
<TE>   "It only affects me in a positive way," he said. "I get out of
class, and my parents know for sure that I'm drug-free."</TE>

<HD>Challengers File for School Board Races</HD>
<DH>Three Latinos seek to oust David Tokofsky. President
Caprice Young will face two foes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Solomon Moore</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the filing period for the local election candidates ended at noon
Saturday, the Los Angeles Unified School District race for incumbent
member David Tokofsky's seat seemed destined to be a test of Latino
resolve.</LD>
<LD>   Three of the candidates in that contest are Latinos, while
Tokofsky, a former L.A. Unified teacher and two-term incumbent, is a
white man of Jewish heritage who speaks Spanish fluently.</LD>
<LD>   "I think that this is an opportunity for Latino leadership to
emerge," said candidate Jose Sigala, aide to Assemblyman Marco
Firebaugh (D-Los Angeles).</LD>
<TE>   Privately, some Latino political consultants have said Tokofsky
"doesn't fit the profile" of his constituency, which is increasingly
Latino. Immigration and a redistricting battle earlier this year made
the 5th District, which covers much of East Los Angeles, Silver Lake
and Eagle Rock, L.A. Unified's most heavily Latino area. About 56% of
registered voters in the district are Latino, according to Tokofsky.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday another Latino candidate -- schoolteacher and
Democratic activist Nellie Rios-Parra -- joined the race.
Rios-Parra's husband, Alvin Parra, just dropped his candidacy for
City Council District 14 last week to make way for Antonio
Villaraigosa's run there.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Lou Calanche, an educator and unsuccessful Los Angeles
Community College District candidate, threw her hat into the ring
early last week.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to being coveted by Latino politicos, the 5th District
has attracted intense interest from former Los Angeles Mayor Richard
Riordan and billionaire financier Eli Broad.</TE>
<TE>   The Times reported earlier this month comments by Occidental
College President Ted Mitchell that the two men had talked to him
about his possibly running against Tokofsky. According to sources who
heard a presentation Mitchell gave to 13 members of Occidental's
board of trustees, Broad had proposed a $10-million donation to the
college if Mitchell ran.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after that meeting, Mitchell said he would not seek the
seat. Broad later said the donation and a Mitchell candidacy were not
linked.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, the events underscored the attention the two tycoons
are giving the 5th District.</TE>
<TE>   Sigala said he has met with Riordan and a Broad employee named Amy
Wakeland, who worked on the L.A. Unified redistricting panel.</TE>
<TE>   Rios-Parra said she had a meeting with both men, from whom she had
looked forward to gaining some information about the Broad
Foundation's work around the country.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted to share with me their positions on vouchers, charter
schools, school reform and accountability," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "They came down hard on me on my views on bilingual education,"
said Rios-Parra, who supports a limited role for Spanish-language
instruction. "I don't think they appreciated that position."</TE>
<TE>   Tokofsky said Saturday that he is confident he will win
reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Sigala acknowledged that he and the two other Latino candidates
may split the Latino vote, but he said he is counting on winning in a
runoff.</TE>
<TE>   School board President Caprice Young's incumbency will also face
an unexpected challenge next March from two candidates who filed
papers Friday and Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Jon M. Lauritzen is a former teacher who narrowly lost a race for
the 39th Assembly District two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We've endorsed him twice for Assembly," said John Perez,
president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, the 40,000-member union.</TE>
<TE>   Lauritzen said he would emphasize his experience in the classroom
and Young's decision to increase the number of children in some
classes to make up for a budget shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   He also criticized Young's close ties to Riordan and Broad, who
recruited her and steered donations to her 1999 election campaign
and, last year, to a redistricting effort.</TE>
<TE>   John Regis Kuhn, a relative unknown, is also running in the 3rd
District.</TE>
<TE>   The longest-serving member on the school board, Julie Korenstein,
filed papers Saturday morning to run for the City Council's 12th
District.</TE>
<TE>   Korenstein, who is in her 16th year on the board, has been a
strong labor advocate and a proponent for San Fernando Valley
interests.</TE>
<TE>   She is the only board member who has not received a contribution
from Riordan's and Broad's campaign committee, and her seat is
expected to be hotly contested when it comes up for reelection in
2005.</TE>
<TE>   Korenstein said in an interview Saturday that she has had her eye
on the 12th Council District ever since she lost a 1991 bid by less
than 1,000 votes. The seat is being vacated by Hal Bernson because of
term limits and promises to provide one of the hardest-fought city
races, with a total of nine contenders.</TE>

<HD>Being a CEO 'in the Tradition of Abraham'</HD>
<DH>Much is expected of them, Timberland chief tells Jewish
execs. He explains how his firm gives employees paid leave for
service work.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Cara Mia DiMassa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The lesson of the day pertained to the modern marketplace, but it was
steeped in Old World values.</LD>
<LD>   At the first meeting of the Jewish Federation's CEO Leadership
Forum, Jonathan Swartz, chief executive of the clothing company
Timberland, stood at a lectern and wondered aloud: "How do you
maintain your values, even in the midst of day-to-day business
dealings?"</LD>
<LD>   Swartz, who had flown to Los Angeles from Boston to answer his own
question, began by alluding to the story of Abraham, whose faith was
tested by adversity.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a daily trial of the Jew who is a CEO," he said: "to
integrate into daily life the value system" that the Jewish tradition
teaches.</TE>
<TE>   More than a few heads nodded in understanding as he spoke. His was
a receptive audience. The Jewish Federation had invited 75 Jewish
leaders of such companies as City National Bank, Cherokee and
Westfield to "share the view from the top," as the event's invitation
promised.</TE>
<TE>   After kosher-style canapes and a short video about the
federation's long history of supporting its Los Angeles-area
community, Steven Nichols, president of K-Swiss and a co-chairman of
the event, introduced Swartz as a "model of corporate and social
responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   It was clear, as Nichols recited Swartz's resume, that this was a
worthy cleric for preaching the message that doing good works should
be an integral part of corporate life. He serves on President Bush's
task force on national service and has instituted a program called
the Path of Service at his own company. Among other things,
Timberland employees are given 40 hours of paid leave each year to
perform community service -- paint a house, tutor a student, comfort
the elderly.</TE>
<TE>   Swartz told the audience that his legacy of service, as well as
his company's, could be traced back to his grandfather Nathan, who in
1952 started the firm that would become Timberland.</TE>
<TE>   Nathan was a shoemaker. But he was always committed to serving
others and doing good works.</TE>
<TE>   "My grandfather taught me how to cut leather," Swartz said. "He
also taught me to be courageous and stand up for what you believed
in."</TE>
<TE>   "My grandfather lived his values.... And we are the inheritors of
his passion for product."</TE>
<TE>   "In order to equip people to make their difference in the world,"
Swartz said, "we must insist that doing well and doing good not be
different."</TE>
<TE>   It is not enough for the people in the room, he said, simply to
pay employees fairly and not abuse workers. As Jewish CEOs, they must
hold themselves to a "higher standard of commerce and justice," he
said. "We are supposed to be CEOs in the tradition of Abraham. Much
is expected of us."</TE>
<TE>   Swartz admitted he has it easy, in that his family controls the
majority of his company's stock, and he represents its third
generation to helm the firm.</TE>
<TE>   "My job is all about nepotism," he admitted as the audience joined
him in a laugh. "So I don't have strategic thoughts. But I do have
universal truths."</TE>
<TE>   The audience may have been Jewish, but the message transcended
religion. Other firms, he pointed out, give employees time off to
serve in the National Guard or volunteer for the local fire
department. Why, he asked, should mentoring children or reading to
the elderly be any less important?</TE>
<TE>   Swartz told the audience that the Path of Service program sprang
from personal experience. In 1989 a group called City Year, a sort of
urban Peace Corps based in Boston, had asked Timberland to provide 50
pairs of boots for the young people in the organization's program. As
a thank you, the group invited Swartz to a day of community service
-- and he was hooked.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Timberland estimates that its 5,200 employees have invested
more than 170,000 hours in community service in 13 countries. In
addition, it works with business partners and vendors to arrange
regional service events.</TE>
<TE>   "Others can simply build shoes and boots and clothes," Swartz
said. "We can make a difference in our daily lives, and will."</TE>
<TE>   Encouraging employees to do good work is good for corporate morale
as well, he said. Fortune magazine consistently rates Timberland as
one of the best companies in the country to work for.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to an audience member's question about how much time he
personally spends doing good works, Swartz said he is committed to
the concept of tithing, under which 10% of his income goes to charity
each year.</TE>
<TE>   But he said he realized that "the money part wasn't entirely
satisfying." Now, he said, he, his wife and their two sons tithe
hours as well. "We try to invest a day a week," he said. Overall,
"10% of our family's time is in service to others."</TE>
<TE>   Swartz admitted that there is still much work to be done, both for
his company and for the companies run by the other people in the
room. But give people a chance to serve others, he said, and they
often respond to the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't found a corporate environment where there aren't people
who want to serve a truth greater than them," he said.</TE>

<HD>Buyer Vows to Trump Pebble Beach</HD>
<DH>Flamboyant New York developer details big plans for course
in Rancho Palos Verdes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephanie Chavez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Donald Trump rode into the ocean-view enclave of Rancho Palos Verdes
in a black stretch limousine Saturday and told a roomful of residents
what's in store for their city's most prized piece of property if he
gets his way.</LD>
<LD>   First, he said, forget about your "very good" but basically
uninspiring Ocean Trails Golf Club course, the one whose 18th hole
slid into the Pacific Ocean a few years back, eventually bankrupting
the last developer. The new golf course on which he intends to close
escrow in two weeks could become the "Trump National Golf Club,
Rancho Palos Verdes."</LD>
<LD>   Second, watch out Pebble Beach, he said. You members of the
Riviera and Los Angeles country clubs? You won't be able to match the
beauty and challenge of the new Trump golf club.</LD>
<TE>   "Look, no course in L.A. has the Pacific Ocean," Trump said. "No
course in L.A. will even be able to compete."</TE>
<TE>   If that's not enough, he boldly vowed to outdo the famous
ocean-side eighth hole at Pebble Beach by reconfiguring an existing
Ocean Trails hole so that it is perched on the fringe of a bluff.</TE>
<TE>   Trump's pitch is the latest in a nearly 10-year development saga
for 261 spectacular acres on Palos Verdes Peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   Residents fought and won 65 acres of open space, 17 acres of
parkland and 10 miles of public trails as part of an agreement that
allowed the former developers, Kenneth and Robert Zuckerman, to build
the golf course and 75 luxury homes. But weeks before their course
was to open in June 1999, a chunk of land fell into the ocean,
because of sewer pipe leakage. The Zuckermans filed for bankruptcy
protection, after which the lender called in its loan and took
control of the course last May.</TE>
<TE>   Word of Trump's impending purchase became public in August, but
details of his plan were not disclosed until Saturday. Trump said he
wants to build only about 55 luxury homes, not the 75 that had been
approved for the site, and to add a driving range. He also wants to
close the course to the public and make it an exclusive, pricey,
private country club.</TE>
<TE>   So, residents and city council members, the decision is up to you,
he said. "Are we going to have a superlative course, a great course,
a course to rival Pebble Beach with a world-class driving range?"</TE>
<TE>   Their answer was straight out of a city code book.</TE>
<TE>   Any substantial changes to the original plan would "have to come
to the full council to be judged," said City Councilman Larry Clark,
who added that the California Coastal Commission would also have to
approve any changes, such as tinkering with the placement of holes
near sensitive coastal bluffs.</TE>
<TE>   Trump's pitch to a standing-room-only crowd at the Ocean Trails
ballroom appeared to be well received. Just don't mess with our
public space, warned several community leaders.</TE>
<TE>   And, said one woman, "big names don't impress us" in Rancho Palos
Verdes, which is one of the most affluent ZIP Codes in the county,
with a median home price of more than $720,000.</TE>
<TE>   Not to be outdone by money talk, Trump made sure to tell residents
that this project " is a small deal for me," like a fun, "weekend
job," on which he said he intends to spend in excess of $45 million.
The New Yorker said he wants to build himself an ocean-view home on
the land and work with officials of Loews Hotels, who have plans for
a nearby resort.</TE>
<TE>   He met with a prominent Los Angeles real estate figure, John
Cushman, last week in New York to discuss the possibility of building
a residential high-rise elsewhere in town.</TE>
<TE>   "I would not be surprised if I came to Los Angeles and built Trump
Tower," he said.</TE>

<DH>Cool Homes gives teens a place to calm down and counsels
families on handling tough times.</DH>

<LD>Kelsey was fighting with her stepdad -- again -- when she first
thought about running away.</LD>
<LD>   Once a solid student, the 15-year-old was close to flunking out of
her Ventura high school. She had fallen in with the wrong crowd and
was trying drugs. Now she was mad at her parents, this time over her
stepfather's insistence that she keep a midnight curfew.</LD>
<LD>   Before slipping out a window, though, Kelsey talked to a high
school counselor. That turned out to be a good move.</LD>
<TE>   The counselor referred her to Interface Children Family Services,
a Ventura County agency that runs a temporary foster care program
called Cool Homes. Cool Homes gives teens a place to stay for a few
days when things get bad at home.</TE>
<TE>   After three days apart, Kelsey and her parents had cooler heads
and were ready to talk again. Interface counselors met with them to
help navigate the land mines that threatened to tear their
relationship apart.</TE>
<TE>   Kelsey, now 19, calls it a turning point. "I made a decision to
change my life, and I got it back together eventually," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Follow-up counseling helped her confront the real source of her
turmoil -- the separation and eventual divorce of her parents, Kelsey
said. "When I was thinking about running away, it felt like freedom,"
said Kelsey, now a receptionist. "It scares me that I had those
thoughts."</TE>
<TE>   Keeping kids off the streets is a primary goal of Cool Homes, said
Interface chief program officer Terry Miller. Counselors teach
parents and teens how to get through the awkward years with a minimum
of damage, she said. And it's free -- important to families like
Kelsey's.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother suffers from mental illness, and her stepfather hauls
trash bins for a living. They never could have afforded professional
help, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Cool Homes was one of the first programs Interface offered when it
formed in 1973, Miller said. Now the private, nonprofit organization
operates more than 80 services, helping families affected by child
abuse, domestic violence and poverty.</TE>
<TE>   A federal grant allows Interface to place about 120 teenagers a
year at Cool Homes, Miller said. The program, which received $5,000
from the Times Holiday Campaign, could expand if Interface had more
funding, she said. Recipients must wait a year before they can be
eligible again for Holiday Campaign grants.</TE>
<TE>   The annual Holiday Campaign was established in 2000 and is a part
of the Los Angeles Times Family Fund, a fund of the McCormick Tribune
Foundation. The foundation matches the first $700,000 raised at 50
cents on the dollar, and the foundation and The Times absorb all
administrative costs.</TE>

<HD>Iraqi Exiles Cast a Hopeful Eye on Homeland</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jessica Garrison</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>EL CAJON</DL>
<LD>At a rotund 73, John Kalabat makes an unlikely revolutionary. But the
poet and Iraqi exile snacking on pita bread and hummus in a local
nightclub said that he wants to help bring down Saddam Hussein and
rebuild his shattered homeland.</LD>
<LD>   "I can be a translator," he said. "A guide. I'm ready to
participate."</LD>
<LD>   Kalabat's view is widely shared -- though not universally -- in
this San Diego County community. It is home to what local leaders say
are 30,000 Iraqi immigrants, including about 20,000 Catholics, about
6,000 Kurds and 5,000 Shiite Muslims.</LD>
<TE>   From liquor stores to university offices to auto body shops, news
of Friday's U.N. Security Council vote calling on Hussein to disarm
or face consequences whipped through the Iraqi community and provoked
a range of emotions.</TE>
<TE>   Some were fearful of what punitive military action could mean for
relatives in Iraq who have already suffered much in the war- and
sanctions-ravaged country. Others believe that war is wrong or that
Hussein might back down and thus hold on to power. Still others
allowed themselves to hope that they may one day go home -- if only
for a visit.</TE>
<TE>   "We are really happy that eventually this will result in a
changing government," said Arkan Somo, an Iraqi Catholic who was born
in Baghdad and now lives in Rancho San Diego. Somo is president of a
trade association that represents hundreds of Iraqi Christians, or
Chaldeans, who own liquor shops -- as many did back home, where
Muslim custom frowns on it -- and grocery stores.</TE>
<TE>   "The concern we have is the innocent children," he said. "The
fathers and mothers and families will be bombed, and will be homeless
and will die and suffer."</TE>
<TE>   Beginning with a trickle in the 1950s, and in great waves in the
1980s and 1990s, Iraqis have been drawn here by relatives who helped
ease the way. The language, the culture, the whizzing cars and
fast-paced life took some getting used to. The welcoming climate, at
least, was familiar, a daily reminder of their beloved homeland.</TE>
<TE>   The largest concentration of Iraqis in the U.S. is in Michigan. In
California, in addition to the San Diego community, which is the
state's biggest, Iraqi emigres have established sizable enclaves in
Orange and Los Angeles counties. Most of those are Shiite Muslims who
chafed under the rule of Hussein's Baath Party, which is dominated by
another Islamic sect, Sunni Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the Kurds who settled around San Diego have come since the
mid-'90s, according to Alan Zangana, program director for the Kurdish
Human Rights Watch office there.</TE>
<TE>   Catholics, who have lived in Iraq since antiquity, fled by the
tens of thousands around the time of Iraq's war with Iran in the
early 1980s. Thousands more came after the 1991 Gulf War, and they
are coming still, pushed by continuing discrimination against
Christians and a search for a better life.</TE>
<TE>   And they have found it. The close-knit community revolves around
two El Cajon churches, where established immigrants offer a network
of social and economic support to new arrivals.</TE>
<TE>   "We came to America with nothing, just basically our family," said
Leanne Barbat, 23, a law student. "But everyone knows everyone, and
if anyone has a problem ... we always have a family member there."</TE>
<TE>   Up to 80% of independent liquor stores in San Diego are run by
Chaldeans, according to community estimates, and new arrivals quickly
find work in them. Established proprietors co-sign loans for the
newcomers, and "after that you start working every day, seven days a
week," said Leslie Barbat, Leanne's mother.</TE>
<TE>   The Barbats immigrated in 1977 and started a grocery store. "You
save up," Leslie Barbat said. "You buy a house. You buy a car." And
you can pay for your children's education.</TE>
<TE>   "When my daughter graduated from college, it was the happiest day
of my life," she said. "When you are young in Iraq, the girls get
married fast, and they don't have the opportunity to go to school."</TE>
<TE>   Community life here revolves around the church and social clubs.
Father Michael Bazzi, a priest at St. Peter's Chaldean Catholic
Church, where Barbat's family worships, said new families move to the
parish each week. They come directly from Iraq or from other
countries where they stayed while waiting for permission to
immigrate.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, St. Peter's became a cathedral after the Vatican made
San Diego the second Chaldean Diocese in the United States (the first
is in the Detroit area), responsible for Chaldeans from Alaska to
Nebraska. Services are held in English or Aramaic, which many members
proudly note is the language that Jesus spoke.</TE>
<TE>   For Chaldeans who were forbidden to study Aramaic in Iraq because
of anti-Christian dictates, the church offers twice-weekly Aramaic
lessons and provides translation services.</TE>
<TE>   The church also has a bustling community center, which Bazzi said
he helped build. "I came here in 1985, and I said ... 'You have to
have a community center.' I went to every store, and I just [pointed]
my finger to say: 'You give me $500.' ... In three months, I had more
than $300,000."</TE>
<TE>   When not at church or work, many Chaldeans gather at the Crystal
Ballroom, a club in El Cajon, where they can eat hummus and salads
and sip cocktails. On a recent evening, members pointed out men who
were doctors, lawyers and architects in Iraq who now run stores or
pizza parlors.</TE>
<TE>   Sabah Sadik, 63, was a journalist back home. He fled in 1978 in
fear for his life because he criticized the Baath Party in print. Now
he runs New York Giant Pizza in La Mesa and in his spare hours writes
for expatriate publications.</TE>
<TE>   Lately, Sadik has joined Kurds, Shiites and fellow Chaldeans in
Tuesday night meetings to plan what they hope will be a democratic
future for their home country. Last month, the group, which calls
itself the Iraqi League for Democracy, held a march in downtown San
Diego protesting Iraq's recent election. Many of the members believe
the polling was a sham.</TE>
<TE>   Last week they met with local antiwar activists and pleaded with
them to include anti-Hussein placards in their peace marches. They
told the activists that Iraqi television is broadcasting their
protests to suggest that American people support the current Iraqi
regime.</TE>
<TE>   Life is not all politics, though recently it seems to seep in
everywhere. In the Crystal Ballroom, under a mirrored disco ball, men
play Wishlyiai, a card game similar to gin rummy that many brought
from their native village, Tilkepi, in northern Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Between hands, they are only too happy to discuss politics, though
few want to be quoted for fear of retribution against loved ones in
Iraq. But later by phone, Somo is happy to discuss his support for
the Republican Party (including Bill Simon's recent run for governor
of California). He likes President Bush's hard line against the Iraqi
regime.</TE>
<TE>   "I am a strong believer in our president," Somo said. "I think
this time around we'll finish the job."</TE>
<TE>   The younger generation joins the elders at the club, but they have
cell phones arrayed on their table instead of playing cards, and
their talk runs more to their work as lawyers and other
professionals. Most of their memories of Iraq are hazy, if they have
them. They would not go back. Their lives are here.</TE>
<TE>   "We might have 900 liquor stores in this community," said John
Attiq, 39, "but the younger generation are all striving to be
professionals."</TE>
<TE>   Steven Ilia is a 26-year-old lawyer who sometimes visits the
ballroom. He left Iraq at age 3 and can remember hiding with his
family in the basement during the war with Iran.</TE>
<TE>   He has no desire to return, he said in a telephone interview. He
is American. When it comes time to marry, he is willing to break
tradition and choose an outsider. "This is a tight-knit, close
community and people like to marry other Chaldeans," he said. "I
would probably marry whoever I fell in love with."</TE>
<TE>   Still, even as they fall in love with cell phones and other
Southern California accouterments, many maintain close ties to Iraq,
talking by phone to relatives weekly or monthly. Somo, who immigrated
in 1982 and is president of a local trade association, said his
brother in Baghdad is fearful of what the near future will bring.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell him that nobody knows how this [political standoff] will
end," he said. "But it is my dream to one day have dual citizenship
... and to take my three daughters back home to visit."</TE>

<HD>Hollywood Activist Says His $2.5 Million Was Well Spent</HD>
<DH>Gene La Pietra calls the secession defeat a success for
bringing attention to the community's needs. He also admits future
political aspirations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sharon Bernstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's the morning after Hollywood secession's undeniable, unspinnable
trouncing at the polls, and Gene La Pietra, the driving force behind
the movement, is back at his campaign headquarters, perfectly groomed
and declaring victory.</LD>
<LD>   The nightclub owner, a six-figure contributor to politicians and
nonprofit groups, sank what he estimates as $2.5 million of his money
into a quixotic campaign to wrest Hollywood away from the city of Los
Angeles, and install himself as its mayor. But Hollywood secession
went down by a ratio of more than 2 to 1, and La Pietra didn't even
get the most votes among candidates who sought a spot on the proposed
city council. He finished second to neighborhood activist Rosa
Martinez, whose campaign cost a little more than $4,000.</LD>
<LD>   Campaign contribution records filed thus far with the Los Angeles
Ethics Commission show payments by La Pietra of just under $1.9
million, but he says that by the time the bills are all paid he will
have spent $2.5 million in contributions to cityhood campaigns in
both Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley, as well as his own
campaign for Hollywood city council.</LD>
<TE>   La Pietra, 54, said his net worth was roughly $20 million before
the secession campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Now that it's over, he said the experience changed him and gave
him the heady sense of power and responsibility that comes from being
a political leader: the easy access to the media, the followers who
depend upon you, the ability to make the mayor of a huge city respond
to what you have to say.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd do it again," he declared. "I'd spend it all again."</TE>
<TE>   The victory, La Pietra said, came in the way the campaign drew
international attention to the run-down streets of Hollywood, and
forced the city's elected officials to take notice of the community's
needs.</TE>
<TE>   A lifelong Democrat, he said he will pursue those causes as an
activist or candidate.</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra's generous backing of elected officials, including Gov.
Gray Davis and even Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn, may force
Democratic Party leaders to take him seriously.</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra said he will not try to unseat Councilman Tom La Bonge,
up for reelection next spring. He said he is considering seeking
other offices but was not specific.</TE>
<TE>   Secession's dismal showing could hurt him in another run,
political consultant John Shallman said. Moreover, several activists
said, La Pietra, who owns homes in Los Feliz and Hollywood, is
something of an outsider in community politics.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have a hard time backing him for City Council or Assembly
or anything like that," said Dave Gajda, an activist and Hollywood
businessman.</TE>
<TE>   Many in the community, Gajda said, were offended by La Pietra's
claims during the campaign that little had been done to improve the
blighted areas of Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "My partner and I spend 10 to 15 hours a week on causes to improve
Hollywood," said Gajda, who also cited work by the Hollywood Chamber
of Commerce, neighborhood groups and the city of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Another potential hurdle to a political career is that La Pietra
does not have the personal history and lifestyle some believe is
necessary to win at the polls. In the early 1970s he was convicted of
state and federal obscenity charges for selling sexually explicit
videos and books. He is openly gay and owns two nightclubs.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold Steinberg, a Republican political strategist, said La
Pietra could get elected to a state legislative office based in
Hollywood, where voters would be more likely to tolerate an
unconventional candidate.</TE>
<TE>   "A rich candidate still brings a lot to bear for these legislative
contests," Steinberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Eric Garcetti, who represents Hollywood, agreed that La
Pietra might have a political future.</TE>
<TE>   "When you spend $2.5 million, you definitely have good name
identification and exposure," Garcetti said. "He should be taken
seriously."</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra is taking a break now that the campaign is over. He is
shutting down the gaudily painted brick mini-mall he bought recently
and used as his political headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   From an office in the Crossroads of the World building on Sunset
Boulevard, he plans to return to a pet project -- renovating a park
in Hollywood and turning it into a free, 24-hour center for runaways
and other disadvantaged youths.</TE>
<TE>   Although this was his second time out as a candidate -- he spent
$336,000 in a losing bid for a West Hollywood City Council seat -- La
Pietra has wielded political influence over the years.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1993, he has contributed $170,000 to Davis. This year, he
gave $5,000 to Assemblyman Paul Koretz (D-West Hollywood), who
endorsed his bid for Hollywood council.</TE>
<TE>   Shallman, who has advised such Los Angeles politicians as La
Bonge, Councilwoman Wendy Greuel and the late Sheriff Sherman Block,
said La Pietra might have more influence if he remains a fund-raiser
and philanthropist.</TE>
<TE>   But La Pietra said he is different now -- more confident in front
of the cameras, more comfortable with the role of prospective leader.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one thing being a contributor, and another thing being a
player," La Pietra said. "They're totally different roles."</TE>

<HD>Making a Nonviolent Act a Third Strike Is Just Plain Crazy</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>There's the Army veteran who got 50 years to life for a third-strike
crime of stealing "Snow White," "Cinderella" and "Free Willy" videos
in Ontario. And there's the man who got 25 to life for a third-strike
crime of stealing three golf clubs from an El Segundo golf course.</LD>
<LD>   It's cruel and unusual punishment, Fred and Teresa Zullo of Los
Angeles believe. But when they flew back East last week to hear
arguments against California's three-strikes law before the U.S.
Supreme Court, it was primarily for their youngest son.</LD>
<LD>   "We took this with us," Fred Zullo says in his North Hills home,
showing me a placard with a photo of 25-year-old Philip Zullo. Under
the photo, Fred and Teresa had written these words:</LD>
<TE>   "Mentally ill man facing 90 years in prison for making phone
threats."</TE>
<TE>   The Zullos say their son was perfectly normal until his teens,
when he seemed to retreat into a distant universe. As it got worse,
he'd sleep for 20 hours at a time, then be up for days, his wires
crossed.</TE>
<TE>   Attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity were the first
guesses by doctors, but in 1999, Philip was diagnosed as bipolar and
obsessive-compulsive. A short time later, he decided he wanted to
die. In his mind, the quickest way was to threaten mayhem so police
would come and kill him.</TE>
<TE>   Philip called an ex-girlfriend and said he'd kill her and her
relatives, and then he called police in Simi Valley and told them
they better come and get him. He had no gun, but he later told his
father he planned to stuff an electric screwdriver into his pants.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he'd pull it out when the police came," Fred Zullo says,
"and they'd think it was a gun and kill him."</TE>
<TE>   Zullo, who runs a small property management company with his wife,
took his son to the psychiatric ward at Northridge Hospital, thinking
he'd be kept on a three-day commitment. But two days later he was
released, and Zullo arrived at the hospital to find Philip being
loaded into a police car from Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard him saying, 'Kill me, please. Please kill me. Please kill
me.' They hogtied him and threw him into the back of the car, and as
he was going away he saw me and said, 'Please kill me. I can't stand
what's going on in my brain.' "</TE>
<TE>   Philip was convicted in Ventura County of two counts of making
terroristic threats by telephone and spent nine months in jail. The
Zullos were stunned that a man so ill, in obvious need of medical
attention, was locked up as a criminal.</TE>
<TE>   "They picked him up from a psychiatric ward, screaming," Teresa
Zullo says, incredulous. "Why not take him back to the psychiatric
ward instead of taking him to jail?"</TE>
<TE>   Philip was released in even worse shape, Fred Zullo says. At
first, with treatment, he got better. But in classic fashion with
such diseases of the brain, he thought he was cured and stopped
taking his medicine. Then he made another round of threats by phone,
again hoping police would kill him.</TE>
<TE>   This time, he drew three more charges of making terroristic
threats. And the Ventura County district attorney's office, given the
two earlier convictions, decided to prosecute him under the
three-strikes law.</TE>
<TE>   Zullo spent another seven months in jail awaiting a trial that
keeps getting delayed. His parents finally raised $500,000 bail and
put their son in a treatment center. Philip has pleaded not guilty by
reason of insanity, and the trial is set for January.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted on one of the three new charges, Deputy Dist. Atty.
Kathy LaSalle told me, Zullo will get 25 to life. With two
convictions, 50 to life. With three, 75 to life.</TE>
<TE>   Special circumstances, based on the two earlier convictions, could
add another 10 years, LaSalle said, bringing the total to a mere 85
to life, not 90.</TE>
<TE>   I'm sure that's a relief to the Zullo family -- Philip getting
sprung at the age of 110 instead of 115.</TE>
<TE>   It's absolutely draconian, Teresa says.</TE>
<TE>   It's like we're living in the Stone Age, Fred says.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't dismiss his son's crimes as harmless, but he wonders
what society expects to gain by punishing the mentally ill.</TE>
<TE>   You could also ask what California hopes to gain by being the only
state in the nation to allow a nonviolent third strike like petty
theft to send someone away for life.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just cruel and unusual punishment; it's cruel and
unique," says Erwin Chemerinsky, who argued before the Supreme Court
last week in defense of the man sentenced to 50 years for stealing
three children's videos.</TE>
<TE>   "We have 343 people serving 25 to life whose third strike was
shoplifting small amounts. We have 650 whose third strike was
possession of small amounts of drugs."</TE>
<TE>   Multiply by roughly $25,000 a year, the annual cost of
incarceration, Chemerinsky suggests, and ask yourself if those tax
dollars would be better spent on education, drug rehab or mental
health care.</TE>
<TE>   The irony is that when the three-strikes measure was on the ballot
in 1994, it looked good to Fred and Teresa. They both voted for it.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought it was going to get murderers, rapists and carjackers
off the streets. We didn't read the fine print," Fred Zullo says.
"Our son never harmed anyone, and he could go to jail for the rest of
his life."</TE>
<TE>   LaSalle, the prosecutor, said three-strikes was designed for no
other reason than to protect the public from repeat offenders.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of mentally ill people who might actually kill
somebody," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe so, but how good can any prosecutor feel about Philip Zullo
rotting away in prison?</TE>
<TE>   LaSalle said it's conceivable her office will change its mind
about a three-strikes prosecution, but she wouldn't speculate. The
issue is whether Philip Zullo was sane when he made the threats, she
said. If her office believes he was, he'll get the three-strikes
treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Farley, Philip Zullo's attorney, is gathering medical reports
in his defense.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Zullo's psychiatric disorder often impairs his capacity for
making good decisions," says a 2001 report from Dr. Alex Kopelowicz
of the San Fernando Mental Health Center. "In my opinion,
incarceration would worsen his condition.... A better alternative
would be that he be placed in a psychiatric rehabilitation center."</TE>
<TE>   "Even if Philip gets out of this tomorrow," Fred Zullo says, "I'm
going to fight for the rest of my life to amend this law."</TE>
<TE>   He and his wife drive around with placards plastered to their car
-- Families to Amend California's Three-Strikes, www.facts1.com. The
group is pushing a ballot initiative that would require any third
strike to be a violent felony.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you want to see what we do every night?" Fred Zullo asks,
leading me to his kitchen and a countertop vigil with candles. "We
stand here and we pray. What else can we do?"</TE>

<HD>Groups Plot Strategy to Ease Marijuana Laws</HD>
<DH>As advocacy organizations meet in Anaheim, one speaker
suggests recall of Gov. Davis. Students join in for the first time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Reyes</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Advocates for liberalizing the nation's drug laws met in Anaheim on
Saturday and discussed marijuana arrests, an appeals court ruling
allowing California doctors to recommend marijuana to sick patients
and the defeat of marijuana legalization in Nevada.</LD>
<LD>   The three-day meeting was aimed at regrouping and discussing new
ideas, said Bruce Mirken, a spokesman for the Washington, D.C.-based
Marijuana Policy Project, which sponsored the conference.</LD>
<LD>   The group teamed for the first time with Students for Sensible
Drug Policy, a 5,000-member organization with chapters in 200 high
schools and colleges nationwide. Of the 400 people at the conference,
most were students.</LD>
<TE>   Sandwiched between seminars, movie producer Aaron Russo ("Trading
Places" and "The Rose") gave a raucous talk that had most of the
young luncheon audience on its feet hooting and clapping.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, as you know, I'm here to talk about that terrible, terrible
drug known as marijuana," said Russo.</TE>
<TE>   He admitted getting high on marijuana with Hollywood celebrities,
many of whom might lose their jobs if their marijuana use was common
knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   "Our laws were meant to protect us," Russo said.</TE>
<TE>   "But I have friends who have been abused, jailed and exploited by
our government and marginalized in our society by these laws."</TE>
<TE>   He suggested that it is time for drug reform groups to make a
political statement, and that they could start in California by
recalling Gov. Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   He accused the governor of failing to help sick people, despite
the passage of Proposition 215 in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   The initiative permits patients to use marijuana legally if they
have a doctor's recommendation.</TE>
<TE>   However, there has been confusion about the legality of the
medical marijuana measure, because possession and use are illegal
under federal law.</TE>
<TE>   California marijuana reformers recently have become more active
after federal agents raided a Santa Cruz medical marijuana collective
Sept. 5, arresting three people and confiscating 130 plants.</TE>
<TE>   In an act of defiance, elected city officials, including the Santa
Cruz mayor, joined with the Women's Alliance for Medical Marijuana to
dispense the drug to sick patients two weeks later.</TE>
<TE>   Students Frustrated</TE>
<TE>   Many in the audience were college students like Martin Baer, a
20-year-old junior at the University of Maryland in College Park. He
got involved with a local chapter of Students for Sensible Drug
Policy in reaction to a drug provision of the Higher Education Act of
1998.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody says education is a route to a better life. But the act
denies federal financial aid to any student with a drug conviction,"
Baer said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's any drug conviction, even for a misdemeanor."</TE>
<TE>   He and other students said they seek reform because of the war on
drugs, and drug policy in the United States that "just doesn't work."</TE>
<TE>   "We're just trying to come up with a better one," Baer said.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates like Robert Kampia, the Marijuana Policy Project's
executive director, have argued that the United States is marching
backward. He said the rest of the world is moving away from marijuana
prohibition.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the project cited FBI statistics on marijuana arrests
for 2001 that dipped just slightly from an all-time high in 2000.
According to the FBI report, 723,498 people were arrested on
marijuana charges last year, down from 734,498 in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   With help from wealthy benefactors, the reform group spent more
than $2 million trying to get the Nevada legalization measure passed,
but persuaded only 39% of the voters.</TE>
<TE>   Project officials were hoping that Nevadans, especially after
voting two years ago to approve the use of marijuana for medicinal
purposes, would endorse the measure.</TE>
<TE>   Many other marijuana advocacy groups were represented at the
conference. They included the Medical Marijuana Patients Union,
Police Officers for Drug Law Reform, Law Enforcement Against
Prohibition, the Drug Policy Alliance and the National Organization
for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.</TE>

<HD>Defiance May Leave Folsom High and Dry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>FOLSOM -- The federal government gave voters here plenty of warning:
Don't approve Measure P or we'll cut back your water supply.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, voters called the government's bluff. In defiance of
federal law and promises made by city leaders, voters in this growing
town east of Sacramento passed a measure prohibiting the city from
charging people for the amount of water they use.</LD>
<LD>   The 54%-46% vote defended a popular sprinkle-and-let-sprinkle way
of life, in which residents can use as much water as they like for a
flat rate of roughly $17 a month. Voters may have been swayed by
arguments that spending $5 million to $6 million to retrofit homes
with water meters made no economic sense.</LD>
<TE>   The outcome stung the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which quickly
warned Folsom last week that it will curtail water deliveries to
certain neighborhoods if meters are not installed by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to make it perfectly clear to everybody," said Tom Aiken,
manager of the agency's Central California district. "No meters, no
federal water.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not trying to punish anybody," Aiken added. "California is
a water-short state, and we've got to implement conservation. Water
is a utility, just like power or gas, and you need to pay for what
you take."</TE>
<TE>   Southern California and coastal residents have long lived with
water meters without complaint. But some folks in river towns resent
the devices as an infringement on their way of life.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say that, typically, when customers switch from flat-rate
to metered-rate service, one-third of the bills go down, one-third go
up and a third stay the same. But the debate is philosophical, not
practical. The charters of Sacramento and Fresno, for example, forbid
the cities from billing residents at a metered rate.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento, about 20 miles downstream on the American River,
dodged the meter mandate because it doesn't buy federal water. That
didn't sit well with many Folsom voters, said Sara Myers, the former
city councilwoman who wrote Measure P and organized its campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "So Folsom is supposed to be the poster child for water meter
retrofitting when Sacramento sits down there with their flat rate?"
she said. "They didn't like that one."</TE>
<TE>   Technically, Measure P does not ban water meters in Folsom.
Instead, it prohibits the city from making residents pay the cost of
retrofitting homes with meters.</TE>
<TE>   Developer fees could go a long way toward paying for meter
retrofits, city officials say. But the rest of Measure P put them in
a real quandary. The initiative, in effect, barred the city from
charging homeowners a metered rate.</TE>
<TE>   That ban flies in the face of what Congress dictated 10 years ago
when it overhauled the operation of the Central Valley Project, a
Redding-to-Bakersfield network of dams and canals run by the bureau.
The law requires cities and irrigation districts that buy from the
water project to install meters within five years of renewing their
Bureau of Reclamation contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Some water districts have begun retrofitting homes with meters,
even though they have yet to renew their contracts. In the suburbs
between Sacramento and Folsom, for example, the San Juan Water
District has retrofitted every pre-1992 home that it serves directly,
at an average cost of $350, said General Manager Jim English.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's going to be a tremendous amount of pressure to
get in line with others in the region," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Folsom City Council has yet to decide how to respond to
Measure P, which was opposed by the mayor and vice mayor. Assistant
Public Works Director Gordon Tornberg called it "a real nightmare."
The city promised to install meters when it joined a regional water
forum and won permission to expand its water treatment plant.</TE>
<TE>   But in the rustic neighborhood near the American River that stands
to be cut off by the bureau if meters are not eventually installed,
residents lack remorse.</TE>
<TE>   On Blue Lake Drive, as T. Eisele swept oak leaves from her
driveway last week, she said the local electricity utility gives away
shade trees to encourage energy conservation, but water officials
haven't come up with any method so creative.</TE>
<TE>   "The meter was only one way," she said, "not the only way."</TE>
<TE>   And in the heart of Folsom's downtown, with wooden sidewalks and
Old West buildings, antiques dealer Richard Gray predicted that
Folsom will meet the bureau in court.</TE>
<TE>   City officials want to install meters, he said, so they can free
up water to supply new subdivisions.</TE>
<TE>   "Build the Auburn dam and we won't be worrying about this," said
Gray, referring to plans for a big dam upstream that has been studied
for a generation but never built.</TE>
<TE>   "When you tell me that, by 2050, we're going to have 30 million
more people in the state," he said, "I want to know where the
communal baths are going to be."</TE>

<HD>Metrolink Line Connects With Ventura Riders</HD>
<DH>Commuters can catch weekday morning runs to L.A. at new
Montalvo station, as service is extended west of Oxnard starting
Monday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Holly J. Wolcott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beginning Monday, commuters in Ventura can catch a train to Los
Angeles each weekday morning as Metrolink service extends west of
Oxnard to a new $6-million station in Montalvo near Johnson Drive.</LD>
<LD>   The service, coupled with a new Metrolink and Amtrak ticket
program out of Oxnard, greatly expands the number of trains available
to west county commuters trying to bypass increasing traffic jams on
freeways.</LD>
<LD>   Another station in downtown Ventura is also planned, officials
said.</LD>
<TE>   For now, with two Metrolink trips early each morning, Ventura
Mayor Ray Di Guilio said local commuters will no longer be forced to
drive to the Oxnard Transportation Center to catch trains.</TE>
<TE>   "This new station makes it very convenient because those commuters
will no longer have to fight the traffic at the Santa Clara River
bridge project," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The two Metrolink trains will depart each weekday morning from the
new outdoor platform station on Ventura Boulevard. The first train
leaves Montalvo at 5:22 a.m. and arrives at Los Angeles Union Station
at 7:12. The second train departs at 6 a.m. and reaches L.A. at 7:50.
Return trains to Montalvo leave Union Station at 4:26 p.m. and 5:10
p.m. and arrive at 6:15 p.m. and 6:58, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I could use it every day," said Stan Ames, a painting
contractor who lives around the corner from the new station in the
small unincorporated community of Montalvo, which is surrounded by
Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Ames, who attended the station's opening ceremony Friday, drives
his truck each day to jobs in Santa Barbara County. But he said he
now hopes to board a train at least once a month to dine and shop in
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Travis of the Ventura County Transportation Commission said
she expects 50 to 60 riders to use the new station, which is between
Johnson Drive and Victoria Avenue, just north of the Ventura Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Before the rail station was built, the site had been used to store
empty trains overnight. The yearlong construction project added 60
parking spaces and new landscaping.</TE>
<TE>   Coinciding with the new station is the recent announcement of the
"Rail2Rail" program between Metrolink and Amtrak. Holders of a
Metrolink monthly pass, which costs $259, can now also ride Amtrak
trains any day of the week.</TE>
<TE>   Four southbound Amtrak trains leave the Seaside Park platform in
downtown Ventura seven days a week: at 7:26 a.m., 9:58 a.m., 2:40
p.m. and 7:42 p.m. The trip to downtown Los Angeles takes about two
hours each way. Return trains leave Los Angeles at 2:55 p.m. and 7
p.m.</TE>
<TE>   On weekends, an extra train leaves Ventura at 12:18 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Travel with the pass is allowed as far south as Oceanside in
northern San Diego County. Amtrak ticket holders can also use
Metrolink for free.</TE>
<TE>   Passengers on the Amtrak trains must begin their trips at the
Oxnard station, because the new Ventura station isn't served by
Amtrak.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,000 people board a Metrolink train each day at Ventura
County's five stations, Travis said. More than 30,000 people ride
Metrolink trains each day in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Although the new station is just opening, officials are planning
for a larger, more permanent station in Ventura. The exact location
hasn't been determined but Seaside Park at the county fairgrounds or
a nearby industrial area off Front Street -- home of the city's
original train station -- are being discussed.</TE>
<TE>   Di Guilio said the permanent station would be near thousands of
new dwellings planned for the downtown area, allowing commuters to
walk to a train station.</TE>
<TE>   "We made a commitment to study" a new site, said Ginger Gherardi,
executive director of the Ventura County Transportation Commission.
"But it will be awhile because there's no money for it yet."</TE>

<LD>I'm easily bought. I wrote a column in 1998 spoofing Orange County
Sheriff-elect Michael S. Carona just as he was about to begin his
first term. A few days later, he called up laughing and said he got a
kick out of it.</LD>
<LD>   What manner of public official was this? It turned me into a
Carona fan.</LD>
<LD>   Now, with a first term under his belt, the man some thought had no
business running for sheriff is being talked about for statewide
office. The California Republican Party's failure again to win a
major race has some in the GOP dropping Carona's name as a lieutenant
governor candidate in 2006.</LD>
<TE>   That's not worth discussing today because it's four years away,
and besides, who cares who runs for lieutenant governor? What is
worth discussing is Carona's emergence from the near-invisibility of
being the county marshal, and whether his success reminds anyone of a
certain someone at the national level whom people dismissed as a
lightweight but who now is seen as something much different.</TE>
<TE>   To Lake Forest Mayor Richard Dixon, who first met Carona when the
then-candidate invited him to lunch, the key to Carona's success is
obvious.</TE>
<TE>   "He hasn't changed from that first sit-down in the restaurant,
talking about why he wanted me to support him," Dixon says. "He's
still a very humble man that truly cares about an individual's
position and situations he may be getting involved in. He comes
across as a person."</TE>
<TE>   Dixon, a 10-year City Council veteran, says even when he's
disagreed with Carona, there was no doubting his genuineness. "There
are some people who, if they told you the sky is blue, the first
thing you'd do is run to the window and look outside," Dixon says.
"If Mike says the sky is blue, you don't have to open the curtains."</TE>
<TE>   There's more than that, Dixon says. Despite holding a job that
wouldn't seem to carry much clout outside Orange County, Carona has
delivered for the county, Dixon says. "It became very clear that
Carona had the ear of leaders throughout the state, all the way to
the governor's office," he says. He attributes that to Carona's
personality.</TE>
<TE>   Developer Buck Johns is part of the conservative, pro-business GOP
establishment in Orange County that first backed Carona. Although
outgoing Sheriff Brad Gates had lamented that Carona was barely
qualified to be a sergeant, let alone sheriff, Johns liked Carona's
politics and steadfastness.</TE>
<TE>   Talk of a 2006 candidacy is premature, Johns says, but he thinks
Carona, 47, will keep his options open. Nor does he think the
traditional dead zone that is Orange County politics would hurt
Carona's chances statewide. "Everyone loves a leader," Johns says.
"Where he comes from is inconsequential. Mike has the kind of
leadership capability that will attract voters across the board."</TE>
<TE>   This one-sided view of Carona is brought to you only because he's
not running for anything soon and to demonstrate what people like
about him. If he has political ambitions that stretch beyond Orange
County, he'll be tested plenty.</TE>
<TE>   For now, however, this unassuming man, who came out of nowhere, is
riding every bit as high as predecessor Brad Gates, considered the
county's most powerful politician when he left office.</TE>
<TE>   Carona doesn't act like a power broker, but neither did a recent
Texas governor thought to be in way over his head when he ran for
president in 2000. Now look at the guy.</TE>
<TE>   Carona for president? Not hardly.</TE>
<TE>   But on the miniaturized scale that now measures Republican
candidates in California, it'll be fun to see if the Carona charm
plays in Petaluma.</TE>

He later served as associate vice president for academic
administration and research.</LD>
<LD>   "Meloan modernized the marketing curricula and recruited new
faculty from throughout the nation," said Randolph W. Westerfield,
dean of the Marshall School of Business.</LD>
<TE>   Meloan, a native of St. Louis, served in the U.S. Merchant Marine
during World War II. He earned a bachelor's degree in business from
St. Louis University, his master's from Washington University and his
doctorate from Indiana University.</TE>
<TE>   Meloan resumed teaching and research in 1981, and remained at the
Marshall School until his retirement. In 1997, he was designated
Distinguished Emeritus Professor of Marketing.</TE>

<HD>Grueling Tuneup Precedes Long March in Pasadena</HD>
<DH>Tournament president shepherds bands as they gear up for
world's most-watched parade.</DH>
<SE>One in an occasional series on the 2003 Tournament of Roses.</SE>
<AU>Joe Mathews</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>HOMEWOOD, Ala</DL>
<LD>HOMEWOOD, Ala. -- Under the watchful eye of a man in a red coat, 210
teenagers from this small town are preparing for a marching band's
toughest test.</LD>
<LD>   On a field cut into a hillside, the Homewood High School Patriot
Band practices turns. The exact dimensions of an intersection 2,000
miles away are painted on the grass. The heat and humidity are
overwhelming, and two musicians faint.</LD>
<LD>   "Hmm," says the red coat, Tournament of Roses President Gary
Thomas, putting his hand on one of the red, white and blue band
uniforms.</LD>
<TE>   "Wool," he says, grimacing, thinking how hot one can get on a
six-mile march through Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Such visits by Thomas represent a crucial check on behalf of the
world's most-watched parade. In an event known for high-strung horses
and highly engineered floats, the Rose Parade's bands face the
highest challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Not all of the 5,000 teenagers who march play instruments -- but
they all carry medical release forms.</TE>
<TE>   Such precautions reflect the Rose Parade's standing in band
circles as the Mt. Everest of marches. It is so physically demanding
that a behind-the-scenes transportation system shuttles dropouts to
the finish line or to nearby hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Bands qualify only after a 10-month worldwide competition that
divides the planet into 15 regions. Invitations go out 14 months
ahead of the parade -- well before selection of floats or horses --
to allow bands time to brace themselves.</TE>
<TE>   And there's the cost. For a single band, the trip to Pasadena can
be an investment of a half-million dollars.</TE>
<TE>   All for an appearance before a worldwide TV audience that lasts no
more than 30 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many moving parts, so many people involved for that
payoff -- it's one of the most difficult events a high school can
attempt," said Mike Grueninger, an Indianapolis tour operator whose
company specializes in transporting bands to the Rose Parade.</TE>
<TE>   The parade is so much work that, though float sponsors clamor to
get into the parade, the tournament often finds itself in the
position of recruiter -- if not supplicant -- when it comes to bands.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, American high schools have produced fewer bands
as arts budgets have dwindled. Many bands have dropped parading in
favor of concert competition. And major parades that once served as
proving grounds for Rose Parade bands -- the Orange Bowl Parade in
Miami, for example -- are no more.</TE>
<TE>   Though hundreds of bands still apply, the country has a limited
number of bands with the musical chops and organizational know-how to
handle a Rose Parade gig. So, care and feeding of bands are vital.
The visits by the red-coated president to every parade band helps
them prepare for the trip. Thomas stays at least three days.</TE>
<TE>   That's longer, joked one teacher in Alabama, than the visit of the
team that renewed Homewood High's accreditation.</TE>
<TE>   50,000 Miles in 140 Days</TE>
<TE>   On their 41st wedding anniversary, Gary Thomas and his wife,
Lieueen, arrived at LAX by 5:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Visiting bands is the duty of the president, and personal
milestones must take a backseat. The Thomases took to the road Jan.
20. Their last band trip, to Hawaii, will be this month. All told,
they will have logged 50,000 miles in 140 days.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a very understanding boss," said Thomas, who works full
time as an assistant facilities director for an electronics company.
"He said, 'You can do this. The only thing I ask is that, when I ask
for Rose Bowl tickets, you'll get them for me.' "</TE>
<TE>   Six hours and a plane change in Memphis later, the Thomases landed
in Alabama. Homewood, population 25,043, greeted them like royalty.</TE>
<TE>   They were put up at a local university in housing typically used
by big donors. The mayor of Homewood -- located just outside
Birmingham -- made a point of being at nearly every event they
attended. Gary Thomas received an audience with the state's most
important official: Dennis Franchione, football coach at the
University of Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   As in most communities that send musicians to Pasadena, Homewood
puts its band at the center of community life. The band director
makes more than his counterpart at the University of Alabama. Six
times in the last two decades, Homewood High has marched in Macy's
Thanksgiving Day Parade.</TE>
<TE>   "People here have been hungry to make a name for themselves," said
a former band director, Pat Morrow. "Band was a way to do that."</TE>
<TE>   In January 2001, Homewood's current band director, Ron Pence,
submitted an application for 2003, including letters of
recommendation from Alabama's governor and two U.S. senators. (Most
successful parade applicants have the support of at least one member
of Congress).</TE>
<TE>   With his application, Pence entered Homewood in a highly
structured competition. Six slots are reserved for perennial band
participants: the Los Angeles Unified School District, the
tournament's own honor band, the Salvation Army, the Marine Corps and
the bands from the universities that play in the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Seventeen slots remain.</TE>
<TE>   Homewood will represent Region 8 of the U.S., which extends from
the panhandle of Oklahoma through Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi
to Florida. To maintain the parade's all-American reputation, the
music committee is charged with finding one parade band in each of
the 13 regions. That can be hard. Region 6, which includes Kansas and
Missouri, is a Dust Bowl for bands; it did not produce a candidate
for 2003. To the south, Texas overflows with candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "We could have a parade of just Texas bands," said a former music
chairman, Joe Delgatto.</TE>
<TE>   In their search, tournament officials follow a manual that runs to
125 pages. Band directors should be experienced -- 20 years on the
top is typical -- and the financial heft of a band boosters' club is
critical. Band units should have 175 or more members, at least 85% of
whom should be playing instruments.</TE>
<TE>   "You need a big sound to be in the Rose Parade, so we like to see
a lot of brass," said Bill Kobayashi, the music committee chairman.
"And the fact is that it takes a lot of musicians to project a lot of
sound."Bands are selected each October by the music committee,
although the president often makes suggestions. A band from the Dutch
community of Pella, Iowa, was recruited for the 2003 parade as a nod
to the Dutch heritage of Thomas' wife.</TE>
<TE>   Homewood, like other bands, received its invitation to the 2003
parade on Nov. 1, 2001. Music committee members were impressed with
the band's performance in the parade after President Bush's
inaugural; particularly noteworthy was the band's dance line of
Star-Spangled girls, who performed in leotards in the bitter January
cold.</TE>
<TE>   Raising Money</TE>
<TE>   As soon as Homewood received its invitation, the avalanche began.
Dozens of travel agents and hotels, desperate for business, deluged
the school.</TE>
<TE>   "Some events require the bands to work through a particular tour
operator, but with the Rose Parade, the tournament leaves everything
up to the band," said Fred Waymack, part owner of Nashville-based
International Travel, which won the bidding for the Homewood
contract. "And with travel companies, you get some that know this
game, and can tell you the size of a tuba case, and some who don't."
A Rose Parade trip typically lasts a week. Air fare, meals and
entertainment, plus six nights at a Marriott, add up. The Homewood
band members will pay $1,287 each -- about average for a Rose Parade
trip.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the time the Thomases spend on the road is devoted to
helping bands raise money. In Alabama, Thomas appeared on TV -- "Good
Morning, Alabama!" -- to solicit support. He headlined a black-tie
auction that raised $83,000. Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman served as a
greeter.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm here because it's a very big deal in this state for a band to
make the Rose Parade," Siegelman said. "When people in Alabama talk
about Homewood, the first thing they talk about is this band."</TE>
<TE>   Fund-raising techniques vary. Homewood kids also are selling fruit
and coupon books.</TE>
<TE>   In Attica, N.Y., band members built a cornfield maze (the crops
resemble a rose from the air) and charged admission. At North
Royalton High School in Ohio, fund-raising efforts were so
high-profile that some parents worried they might undermine a ballot
measure to raise the levy for other school needs.</TE>
<TE>   "With fund-raising this extensive," said Cathy Bican, a North
Royalton trustee and band parent, "you have to be careful that other
parts of the community don't come to resent it."</TE>
<TE>   Survival Tips for Parade</TE>
<TE>   During his Alabama visit, Gary Thomas met three times with
Homewood band members, who applauded his entrance wildly each time
and then listened reverently. Each time, he offered "parade survival"
tips:</TE>
<TE>   Wear form-fitting socks: Tube socks bunch up and cause blisters.
Put on bicycle shorts underneath your uniforms, or the insides of
your legs may end up chapped and bloody. The program may say 5
1/2miles, Thomas said, but with warmups, you'll really walk seven.</TE>
<TE>   At that, band members gasped. All the color left the face of the
band's dance instructor.</TE>
<TE>   Pence merely nodded.</TE>
<TE>   He had been preparing for the long march for some time. His
preparation began in the spring, when Pence flew to Pasadena -- a
"familiarization" visit that most band directors make -- to
photograph the corner of Orange Grove and Colorado boulevards and
videotape the entire route.</TE>
<TE>   In a meeting with the music committee he learned that the parade
demands continuous music. TV crews are instructed to cut away from
bands that stop playing. Injuries are so common that, after crossing
the finish line, each band director is handed a list of members who
have dropped out or been hospitalized.</TE>
<TE>   That's why Homewood's trumpet players were doing training runs.
That's why the band was adding more cushioning to its shoes. (Bands
in Ohio and New York use the indoor facilities of the Cleveland
Browns and Buffalo Bills so they can keep in shape in winter.)</TE>
<TE>   Homewood also may tinker with its cadence to meet the Rose
Parade's demands of an exact 2-hour, 9-minute and 15-second march.
Its drums have been decorated red. Instead of dividing instruments by
sections, the band, like most others in the parade, will mix
instruments to assure that TV microphones don't hear too much brass
at one time and too many woodwinds at another.</TE>
<TE>   The most wrenching changes involve personnel.</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, Pence asked a number of upperclassmen not to return.
They didn't take it seriously enough, said the drum major, Patrick
Darby, and were staying just for the Pasadena trip. They have been
replaced by a record class of 63 freshmen.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the same band we had last year," Pence said. "It's hard
to have so many new people, but it's also refreshing. And you need a
focused group to pull off something like this."</TE>
<TE>   An Impressive Preview</TE>
<TE>   On Thomas' final night in Alabama, he attends a preview for
parents of the Homewood band's new field show.</TE>
<TE>   Pence is tense. The drum section needs work. The heat remains
oppressive. But the music, "When You Wish Upon a Star," is loud and
dramatic.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas is impressed. Homewood, he is sure, will be ready.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a long trip to the Tournament of Roses Parade, and it takes
a tremendous amount of support," he says through the PA system. "We
come and visit all the bands. We think very highly of this band. This
band could go up against anyone in the country, and would come out,
if not on top, a very close second."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas grabs a large flag with the Tournament of Roses logo,
shipped from California. He has repeated this ceremony in 13 states
and two countries this year.</TE>
<TE>   "For Jan. 1, 2003, the official invitation is here extended to the
great state of Alabama and the Homewood High School Patriot Band," he
announces, the in-person confirmation of the letter Homewood received
a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   He hands the flag to the band's two drum majors.</TE>
<TE>   The band cheers, throwing hats in the air. A crowd of 500,
gathered around this football field in the deep South, breaks into
applause.</TE>
<TE>   "Welcome," Thomas booms, "to Pasadena!"</TE>

conservation work by naming ants after them.</LD>
<LD>   Edward O. Wilson, a Harvard University scientist and Pulitzer
Prize-winning author, named a shiny brown ant from Veracruz, Mex-
ico, Pheidole mooreorum, after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Intel
Corp., and Moore's wife, Betty. The Moores are leading environmental
philanthropists.</LD>

<LD>Nobody votes with the sheer relish of people in San Joaquin County.
That's real relish, not the metaphor.</LD>
<LD>   The California secretary of state's office reports the county
turned in the most food-stained, torn and bent ballots of the state's
58 counties.</LD>
<LD>   All told, San Joaquin County received 5,000 mangled ballots on
election day. That's 3,400 more than Los Angeles, the state's most
populous county.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a torn card, it's a crumpled card, it's a card where they
tried to mark the square and they accidentally hit the pen or pencil
in the wrong spot," said Deborah Hench, the county registrar of
voters. "And the absentee voters -- they do spill their coffees and
sodas and accidentally get jelly on them."</TE>

<LD>A man apparently distraught over the pending breakup of his marriage
shot and killed his wife and three young sons early Saturday, then
killed himself, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The family's two daughters escaped from the one-bedroom,
900-square-foot house, where at least 11 people from two families had
been staying.</LD>
<LD>   Officers responded to a frantic 911 call about a domestic argument
just before 5 a.m., Yuba City Police Lt. Bill Ollar said. Inside, he
said, they found a gruesome murder-suicide -- a 26-year-old mother
and two of her boys killed with bullets to the head and another boy
and the 31-year-old father barely alive. The third boy died before
ambulances arrived and the father died later, Ollar said.</LD>
<TE>   Two of the boys were 9-year-old twins. The other was 6.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A convicted serial rapist who requires around-the-clock care cannot
be released from a state mental hospital until authorities find a
place where he can receive the medical treatment he needs, a Sonoma
County judge has ruled.</LD>
<LD>   George Benjamin Putney, 54, has been convicted of four rapes and
one attempted rape, all of which took place in Sonoma County since
1966. He was due to be set free last month, when Atascadero State
Hospital ruled that he was no longer a "sexually violent predator."</LD>
<LD>   Doctors said Putney is too sick with advanced syphilis and
dementia to hurt anyone.</LD>
<TE>   But on Friday, Judge Allan Hardcastle banned the release, saying
the state had made no arrangements for Putney's care. He has been at
Atascadero since 1996.</TE>

<LD>A fiery Kern County tradition that has long stoked the emotions of
two rival football teams may be snuffed out for good -- the victim of
modern air-quality regulations.</LD>
<LD>   Generations of Shafter and Wasco high school students and their
boosters have enjoyed the bonfires on the Thursday night before their
annual matchup.</LD>
<LD>   This year, however, the Kern County Fire Department interrupted
the tradition in Shafter moments before the fire was to start.
Officials said the school lacked a permit from the San Joaquin Valley
Air Pollution Control District.</LD>
<TE>   The valley is considered one of the nation's most polluted air
basins.</TE>
<TE>   The department's action has set off fierce grumbling among
tradition-minded residents. Bob Kard, the air quality district's
director of compliance, said, "We try to reduce open burning to
what's absolutely necessary."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The charge against a former top prosecutor whose conviction for
felony grand theft became an issue in the district attorney's race
has been reduced to a misdemeanor.</LD>
<LD>   Peter Longanbach, 57, the former head of the district attorney's
economic fraud unit, received the lesser charge Friday after
completing 351 hours of volunteer work at a shelter for the homeless.</LD>
<LD>   In November 2001, he pleaded guilty to a felony charge of using
his government staff in his private real estate dealings.</LD>
<TE>   Longanbach's case was a political embarrassment to Dist. Atty.
Paul Pfingst, who was criticized by his opponents during his
reelection campaign for allowing Longanbach's conduct to occur on his
watch.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Pfingst lost his bid for reelection to Superior Court
Judge Bonnie Dumanis, although the results won't be made official
until all the absentee votes are counted.</TE>
<TE>   The California State Bar has suspended Longanbach's law license,
and he is earning money through "real-estate interests," his attorney
Pat Swan said.</TE>

<LD>   In 1966, the Viennese-born woman, who had often been called "the
most beautiful girl in the world," was arrested, charged and
acquitted of swiping $86 worth of merchandise, including greeting
cards and bikini underwear, from the May Co. Wilshire department
store, an Art Deco icon that is now part of the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art complex.</LD>
<LD>   The sensational six-day trial drew standing-room-only crowds
longing for a glimpse of the sultry queen of the screen who had once
inspired center-parted hairdos and, unknown to the public at the
time, had invented an anti-jamming device for radio-controlled
torpedoes during World War II that would become part of the bedrock
for the Internet, pagers, and cordless and wireless phones.</LD>
<TE>   Although she never received an Oscar nomination for her acting,
and her role in the invention of "frequency hopping" was ignored for
decades, the results of her idea are now as hot with technology
enthusiasts as pinups of Lamarr once were with World War II
servicemen.</TE>
<TE>   A sarong-wrapped siren even before Dorothy Lamour, Lamarr was the
star of such films as "Algiers," "White Cargo" and "Lady of the
Tropics," the racy stuff of dreams for hundreds of thousands of men
who marched off to war. In addition to her pinup image, she had an
inquiring mind that in a different era might have taken her to MIT
instead of Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Born Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler in Vienna in 1913, she sprang to
international fame as a teenager when she romped naked across the
screen in the controversial 1932 Czech movie "Ecstasy." Two years
later, she married millionaire Austrian munitions maker Fritz Mandl,
who was horrified when he found out she had done nude scenes.</TE>
<TE>   Obsessed with his young bride's beauty and protecting her virtue
and his name, he spent a fortune buying and destroying copies of the
film and keeping her constantly by his side. He didn't succeed; some
copies of the movie survived, and she eventually left him.</TE>
<TE>   Even though her husband considered her a trophy wife, Lamarr had a
sharp mind. She sat through many dinner conversations about weapons
systems with her husband's engineers, and gradually absorbed a
remarkably advanced education in radio technology.</TE>
<TE>   But she drew the line when he began selling weapons to the Nazis.
In 1937, she fled the loveless marriage by drugging the maid assigned
to guard her, then crawling out a window disguised as a servant.
After making her way to London, she met Louis B. Mayer, who gave her
a $500-a-week MGM contract and a new name.</TE>
<TE>   In Hollywood, she played roles opposite Spencer Tracy, Clark
Gable, Victor Mature and Robert Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   At a Hollywood dinner party during the war, Lamarr met composer
George Antheil, whose compositions included such gimmicks as 14
player pianos playing simultaneously. Lamarr told him about her idea
for a device to protect U.S. radio-guided torpedoes from enemy
attempts to jam them.</TE>
<TE>   He suggested using piano rolls to hop radio signals over various
frequencies. Anyone trying to jam it would hear only random noise,
like a radio dial being spun. Their patent for a "Secret
Communication System" was granted in 1942. They gave their
breakthrough to the government for the war effort but were largely
ignored. They were told their mechanism was too cumbersome to be
implemented.</TE>
<TE>   It would take another 20 years for the usefulness of the concept
to be realized. After the patent ran out, Sylvania developed a
similar device and installed it on ships sent to blockade Cuba in
1962. The two Hollywood inventors never received a penny for the
commercialization of their patent, though it is cited as the
underlying patent for frequency-changing technology. Lamarr found
other ways to contribute to the war effort, selling $7 million worth
of war bonds in a single day, offering kisses at $50,000 a pop,
slinging hash and dancing with soldiers at the Hollywood USO canteen.</TE>
<TE>   The highlight of her film career came in 1949, when she played the
femme fatale Delilah in Cecil B. DeMille's biblical epic "Samson and
Delilah." But thereafter came years of tribulations, including three
more marriages and divorces. Her movie career faded and she was just
another over-the-hill ingenue when she was arrested on suspicion of
shoplifting in January 1966.</TE>
<TE>   Moments after Lamarr, 53, was apprehended with 25 items in the May
Co. parking lot, she reportedly told the security guard: "Some of the
other stores let me do it." When that didn't work, she said: "I'll
just pay for these things and that will settle everything."</TE>
<TE>   But the next day Lamarr told a crowd of reporters at a Beverly
Hills restaurant press conference: "I'm still mystified and
surprised. It's hardly possible" that she was shoplifting, she said,
displaying two checks made out to her totaling $14,000.</TE>
<TE>   "How can I shoplift with these in my bag?"</TE>
<TE>   A week later she was hospitalized with "nervous exhaustion" and
fired from the set of "Picture Mommy Dead." Zsa Zsa Gabor replaced
her.</TE>
<TE>   In April, at the opening of her trial, a young and bright
prosecutor named Ira Reiner accused her of stealing "systematically
and methodically." Reiner, who was fresh out of law school, would
rise to become city attorney, then district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyer Jordan M. Wank described the actress as "forgetful"
and "confused," and said the security guards and the store were out
to get her using "Gestapo tactics."</TE>
<TE>   May Co. security guard Helen McGarry told jurors that she watched
Lamarr place a pair of baby blue stretch slippers on the edge of a
counter and casually sweep them into a large handbag. She then tried
on several plastic headbands and slipped the scarf she was wearing
forward on her head to cover them.</TE>
<TE>   On another floor, McGarry watched her place her large shopping bag
on the floor beneath a rack of suits and watched as one beige suit
tumbled into the open bag.</TE>
<TE>   A salesclerk testified that she had seen Lamarr in the store
several weeks earlier and watched her put a sweater in her bag. When
the clerk confronted Lamarr about the item, Lamarr took it out and
handed it to the clerk.</TE>
<TE>   "Here, you put it back," Lamarr said testily and walked away, the
clerk said.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Ryder, Lamarr took the witness stand at the Municipal
Courthouse and played to overflow crowds, people who might have
forgotten Lamarr but who still wanted to see a star on trial.
Hundreds of people hustled downtown during the morning rush hour on
the chance that a prized seat might open up.</TE>
<TE>   Lamarr testified that she was troubled over the failure of her
sixth marriage. She was threatened with eviction from her Coldwater
Canyon home because she was broke. She had an infected tooth and felt
ill. She had watched the movie "The Pawnbroker" a few days before the
incident, which only added to her depression. She said she went
shopping "to take my mind off" scenes in the movie, about a refugee
from Nazi Germany. She said the film reminded her of her life before
World War II.</TE>
<TE>   In closing arguments, Reiner charged that Lamarr had fashioned a
"grade B" scenario in her courtroom defense. When she was detained at
the police station, she insisted she had "forgotten" to pay for the
merchandise. During the trial, however, she did not plead
forgetfulness, but testified that she had walked out to the parking
lot to find her business manager to write a check for her.</TE>
<TE>   "The overwhelming inference to be drawn from the evidence is that
she was doing just what she appeared to be doing: shoplifting,"
Reiner said.</TE>
<TE>   Lamarr's son, 19-year-old Anthony Loder, testified that his mother
was worried about her fading beauty.</TE>
<TE>   Her attorney, Wank, told the jury: "Because she is who she is, she
is used to privileges.... She was used to a different course of
conduct than might be accorded other people when she went shopping in
the store.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though she has been in financial straits, a lousy $86 does
not mean a thing to her."</TE>
<TE>   A jury of five women and seven men deliberated five hours before
acquitting Lamarr of petty theft.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just two years out of law school and I bent over backward,
all but apologized to be fair to her," Reiner said in a recent
interview.</TE>
<TE>   "During the trial, when the jurors were out to lunch, I walked
into the jury assembly room and found her lying flat on the table,
resting. Not wanting to disturb her, I quickly walked out.</TE>
<TE>   "When the trial was over, about half the jurors approached me and
said that they knew she was guilty, but it was so clear that I didn't
want them to convict her. That was the last time I was Mr. Nice Guy
in the courtroom," Reiner said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1967, Lamarr was infuriated at the way her autobiography,
"Ecstasy and Me," was ghostwritten, detailing her sexual encounters.
The furor sent her into seclusion.</TE>
<TE>   "My face has been my misfortune," she says in the book. "It has
attracted six unsuccessful marriage partners. It has attracted all
the wrong people into my boudoir and brought me tragedy and heartache
for five decades. My face is a mask I cannot remove. I must always
live with it. I curse it."</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, Lamarr, then 78, made headlines in Florida after she was
arrested for walking out of an Orlando drugstore with $21.48 worth of
laxatives and eyedrops. Supermarket tabloids described her as
"destitute."</TE>
<TE>   Calls poured into the police as Lamarr's fans offered to pay her
drugstore bill or provide legal assistance. Prosecutors decided not
to charge her because of her age and poor eyesight -- but only with
her promise not to break any laws for a year.</TE>
<TE>   Three years before she died in January 2000, she and Antheil were
honored by the Electronic Frontier Foundation for "blazing new trails
on the electronic frontier."</TE>
<TE>   The woman who once said, "Any girl can be glamorous -- all you
have to do is stand still and look stupid," was anything but.</TE>

<LD>The powerful Pacific storm that ended Ventura County's mini-drought
cleared out late Saturday after dropping so much precipitation that
the Government Center in Ventura recorded one-third of its average
annual rainfall.</LD>
<LD>   As of 6 p.m. Saturday, a total of 5 inches of rain had fallen at
the Government Center since the storm began Thursday afternoon. The
average seasonal total at that location, according to the Ventura
County Flood Control District, is about 15 inches.</LD>
<LD>   Other storm totals include 6.5 inches of rain in Ojai, 4.8 inches
in Oxnard and approximately 4.5 inches in Thousand Oaks and Simi
Valley. By early Saturday evening, daylong showers had turned to
drizzle and the skyline along the coast was blue and pink.</LD>
<TE>   "This thing was really strong, because you had a lot of dynamics
at play," said Bill Hoffer, a meteorologist at the National Weather
Service in Oxnard. Contributing to the storm's punch were a strong
jet stream, a moisture plume and a slowing when it reached the
coastline Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   When the showers began, forecasters had predicted a total of about
2 inches of rain. Instead, the storm brought the heaviest downpour in
the county since the 1998 floods.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffer expects partly cloudy skies today, with winds of 15 to 25
mph. High temperatures will be in the mid-60s, and lows along the
coast could dip into the upper 40s. Monday, Veterans Day, is expected
to be sunny and warm with highs in the high 70s to low 80s.</TE>
<TE>   While the brunt of the storm slammed the county Friday, dropping 2
to 4 inches of rain in most areas, Saturday's totals were smaller.
Between half an inch and 1 1/2 inches of rain were recorded
throughout the county.</TE>
<TE>   The California Highway Patrol and other law enforcement agencies
reported about three dozen vehicle accidents. One incident early
Saturday resulted in serious injuries, according to the Ventura
County Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   At about 3 a.m., Anthony Mario DeMatteo, 23, of Newbury Park lost
control of his 2002 Volvo station wagon on Lynn Road, east of Felton
Street, in Newbury Park, and it slammed into both a tree and a
concrete block wall.</TE>
<TE>   DeMatteo remained in serious condition Saturday at Los Robles
Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks. Authorities said speed and
a slick roadway contributed to the crash.</TE>
<TE>   No other major incidents were reported, but sheriff's deputies
said the pounding rain had triggered dozens of car and business
alarms. Authorities also said there was no major street flooding and
that traffic on the Ventura Freeway -- which came to a standstill
Friday when instability was detected near the Santa Clara River
bridge -- had been running smoothly.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental health officials reminded residents that runoff can
bring harmful bacteria to beach water and that they shouldn't go into
the ocean or streams until Monday. That warning didn't stop several
surfers from attacking 8- to 10-foot swells that surfaced Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   By Saturday evening, the surf had calmed and forecasters were
calling only for 3- to 5-foot breakers today. For those considering a
holiday trip, Hoffer said snowfall levels could be as low as 4,500
feet today.</TE>

<HD>Waystation Founder to Step Aside</HD>
<DH>The embattled wildlife rescue facility will get a new
management team.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Wendy Thermos</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Under fire from federal authorities, the founder of the Wildlife
Waystation has decided to step back from actively running the animal
rescue center so that a new management team can take over and
reorganize the long-troubled facility, officials said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Martine Colette, founder and longtime executive director, "will be
repositioned" as an advisor and caretaker as part of an effort to
rebuild the operation, said Robert H. Lorsch, an entrepreneur and
philanthropist who will become chairman of a new board of directors
that he is recruiting.</LD>
<LD>   The management changes were disclosed this weekend after the U.S.
Department of Agriculture suspended Colette's license to run the
Wildlife Waystation in the Angeles National Forest because of animal
regulation violations. The 160-acre facility on Little Tujunga Canyon
Road offers refuge to unwanted or abandoned wild and exotic animals.</LD>
<TE>   In a consent decree with the USDA, Colette admitted to nearly 300
regulatory violations in the last several years and agreed to fix
within 30 days any that have not been remedied.</TE>
<TE>   Colette's attorney, David Krantz, said the reorganization was not
part of the decree agreement but that Colette recognizes that the
26-year-old nonprofit facility needs to be run by a skilled team of
managers who can mend its problems with Los Angeles County, state and
federal authorities and turn it into a more sophisticated operation.</TE>
<TE>   "This settlement is part of a whole process of change that's going
on at the way station," he said. He and Lorsch hope to see a
revitalized way station providing training for veterinary schools and
running "the ultimate children's zoo," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Colette said Saturday she is pleased to see new management taking
over. Splitting her time between caring for the animals and running
the office has distracted her from fund-raising and staying in
compliance with her licenses, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The way station has always done wonderful things for animals, but
business has not been our strong point," she said. The facility
provides shelter to an average of 4,500 animals a year, offering
medical care, relocation, and permanent homes to large cats,
primates, bears, birds and snakes, among other animals.</TE>
<TE>   Animal protection groups around the country know Colette as a
one-woman tour de force on behalf of wildlife. Her facility is
considered the largest and longest-standing of its kind in the
nation. Over the years, her dedication has drawn the backing of
celebrities, including Bruce Willis, Will Smith, Drew Barrymore and
Dyan Cannon.</TE>
<TE>   Because county permits have expired and state permits have been
revoked, the way station has been barred for many months from taking
in new animals in need of homes, medical care or rehabilitation.
Despite regulatory compliance problems, the facility is being allowed
by authorities to continue caring for 600 animals that otherwise
would have to be euthanized, Lorsch said.</TE>
<TE>   Violations cited by the USDA included poorly trained staff
members, missing or inadequate health records, a substandard and
unsanitary kitchen and badly constructed cages, Krantz said. The USDA
could not be reached Saturday for comment.</TE>
<TE>   All but four of the 299 violations have been remedied, Krantz
said. "We admitted the allegations, not because they were right or
wrong but because of finances. If we admitted the allegations, we
could avoid a civil penalty. If the civil penalty was $50,000, that's
$50,000 that would not go toward caring for the animals."</TE>
<TE>   The four outstanding violations involve substandard cages for
chimpanzees and lack of a rodent-control program, Krantz said. He and
Lorsch said they plan to have them remedied in 30 to 45 days, at
which time they expect the USDA to reinstate the license.</TE>
<TE>   Lorsch, who is a board director of the California Science Center,
said he was asked by Colette several months ago to take the reins of
the faltering animal center and put it on a new course with a new
executive director and board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the only board of directors I've ever seen that puts on
overalls after the meeting and cleans out the cages," he said. "They
love this organization, but they have not been capable of ...
relationships that are necessary to raise the millions of dollars
that are necessary to take this organization to a higher level."</TE>
<TE>   He said from $5 million to $20 million will be needed in the next
three years. Among the projects awaiting funding is a 700,000-gallon
water tank that the county is requiring be built before it will
reissue an operating permit that expired a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   In April 2000, Colette lost her state Department of Fish and Game
permit because she did not meet standards for caging animals. Lorsch
said the county and state problems will be addressed after the USDA
license is regained.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel that we have been moving forward in a very, very positive
direction," Colette said</TE>

<LD>A tractor-trailer and a van collided on a snowy, slippery stretch of
highway in south-central Wyoming, killing six people, authorities
said.</LD>
<LD>   It was among at least 28 crashes reported on about 300 miles of
Interstate 80 during a nine-hour period, said Wyoming Department of
Transportation spokesman Bruce Burrows.</LD>
<LD>   The van apparently spun out of control, Burrows said. The
tractor-trailer jackknifed trying to avoid the van, and they
collided. All the deaths were in the van.</LD>

<HD>Fuel Oil Leak Ignites Fire on Aircraft Carrier</HD>
<DH>The damage to the Constellation is called minimal. The
vessel, based in San Diego, is headed for Arabian Sea.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tony Perry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A fuel oil leak caused a fire in one of the four main machinery rooms
aboard the San Diego-based aircraft carrier Constellation, steaming
to the northern Arabian Sea and a possible war with Iraq, Navy
officials said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The fire, which took more than an hour to extinguish, caused the
shutdown of part of the ship's propulsion system.</LD>
<LD>   Although officials listed the damage as minimal, they were unsure
Saturday whether the carrier would have to delay its mission in order
to dock at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, for repairs.</LD>
<TE>   The fire occurred Friday night as the carrier was nearing Hawaii.
The Constellation battle group left San Diego a week ago on its way
to the Persian Gulf region, probably to relieve the carrier Abraham
Lincoln.</TE>
<TE>   Cmdr. Jacquie Yost, a spokeswoman for the U.S. 3rd Fleet, said
that "damage control teams aggressively put all of their training to
use and performed outstandingly."</TE>
<TE>   Only minor heatstroke and heat stress injuries were reported. All
were treated by the Constellation medical team.</TE>
<TE>   Ten warplanes were conducting night operations when the fire broke
out below decks. Officials initially thought the planes would have to
be diverted to Hickam Field in Hawaii, but all were able to land on
the carrier.</TE>
<TE>   After 40 years of service and 21 deployments, the 88,000-ton
Constellation is one of the oldest ships in the Navy and is to be
decommissioned in 2003. It is also one of the last carriers that is
not nuclear-powered.</TE>
<TE>   The carrier has 72 warplanes and is accompanied by cruisers,
destroyers and a frigate.</TE>

<HD>Women Tackle Flag Football, With Gusto</HD>
<DH>Players say it's a way to claim a sport they've been
excluded from. Camaraderie and stress relief are big draws too.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Mehren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The defensive lineman hit the right guard with an ominous thud. Oh,
my goodness, said lineman Kathleen Howley, I am so sorry. The victim
responded with a ferocious glower and, on the next play, a hit that
left Howley smarting from a bruise below the eye.</LD>
<LD>   Such was Howley's introduction this fall to the emergent sport of
women's recreational flag football. The 43-year-old Bloomberg News
correspondent quickly caught on to game rules that she said translate
smoothly from the playing field to the arena of professional life.</LD>
<LD>   At first, for example, Howley said she hit her opponents gently,
"just enough to slow them down. Now I hit as hard as I can."</LD>
<TE>   "And I long ago stopped apologizing when I hit people on the
field," she added.</TE>
<TE>   Despite decades of progress by women in formerly "guy" sports such
as soccer, hockey and basketball, football has remained an almost
exclusively male domain.</TE>
<TE>   Ann Bilyew, the 35-year-old coach of Howley's team, the Jamaica
Plain Lava, recalled feeling devastated at age 12 when her father
said she could not go out for football like her brothers. The town
did not permit it, and, he added with paternal compassion, it just
was not a girls' sport.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the first time I ever heard 'girls can't do' something,"
said Bilyew, a partner in a venture capital firm. "That was a major
thing for me. And you know what? That's not the reality anymore. I
don't want to make this sound too lofty, but this is a way to make a
claim to stuff we've been held apart from."</TE>
<TE>   Women's professional football never has found much of an audience.
But recreational football -- played without helmets or pads -- now
attracts about 80,000 women and girls in leagues around the country,
said Diane Beruldsen, founder and president of the International
Women's Flag Football Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Though launched in the United States about 30 years ago, the sport
has grown precipitously in the last five years, Beruldsen said. More
than 100 women's flag football leagues are scattered across the U.S.
and Canada, she said, and nearly 50 teams competed recently in the
sport's largest tournament in Key West, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Many leagues mirror the composition of Boston's Jamaica Plain
district: professional women in their 30s and 40s who missed out on
many of the benefits of Title IX, legislation that 30 years ago
extended federal funding to women's athletics.</TE>
<TE>   "It really takes generations for a law like Title IX to take
effect," Beruldsen said.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Lava -- who joke that their unofficial slogan is
"Remember Pompeii" -- say they play football because they love the
game's physicality. Special-needs teacher Diane Mazzaglia, 31, called
the sport a stress reliever, because "you can't think of anything
else besides playing when you're on the field."</TE>
<TE>   Law librarian Ellen Beckworth, 44, cited the game's cerebral
qualities: "the play-calling and the strategy." Quarterback Linda
Kaczor, a 41-year-old psychologist, said that as a lifelong athlete,
football was something "new and challenging." Besides, she quipped,
"they offered me all the Gatorade I could drink if I joined the
team."</TE>
<TE>   But player after player said the real allure is camaraderie.</TE>
<TE>   "Football is a special sport," said Bilyew, the coach. "You really
have to operate as a unit. The bonds that are formed on this team are
just tremendous. We get together socially, we care about one another,
we support one another."</TE>
<TE>   Flag football takes its name from bright banners that dangle from
each player's hips. Tackling is taboo. Instead, opponents stop a
ballcarrier by ripping off one of her flags. Leagues have some
latitude to craft their own rules -- and in Jamaica Plain, this means
eight players on each side. A game consists of two 20-minute periods,
and field goals are forbidden.</TE>
<TE>   Bruises abound, as do injured knees, fingers and wrists. Female
football players also claim the occasional gender advantage, such as
the ability to twist an unused mouth guard around the strap of a
sports bra for handy storage.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Roby, director of the Center for the Study of Sport and
Society at Boston's Northeastern University, said that even if it is
unlikely to put the NFL out of business, women's flag football should
not be underestimated.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes as a society we get hung up on the idea that unless you
play a sport at the highest level, it doesn't count," Roby said. "I
don't buy that. Think about all the benefits these women are getting
from this sport. It's about playing, challenging yourself,
sacrificing for the good of the team, overcoming adversity and
understanding what that means.</TE>
<TE>   "The other great thing is that it smashes another stereotype --
that women either are not tough enough, athletic enough or
tough-minded enough to play football. We know that is hogwash. It's
another barrier shot down."</TE>
<TE>   Flag football may represent a confluence of the political and the
recreational, but with the thermometer 1 degree above freezing this
Sunday morning, no Lava player had rolled out of bed with the sole
goal of making a statement. A win against the Parkers might earn the
Lava -- named after a defunct neighborhood bar -- a berth in the
league championship game.</TE>
<TE>   But the Parkers roster included five members of a semipro female
football league -- the Lava had none -- and Parkers' middle
linebacker, Katia Paskovich, had played hockey for the Russian
Olympic team. Babies, dogs, spouses and grandparents filled the
sidelines. Shouts of "Nice pass, Janice!" burst from the field. When
two Lava players executed a deft move, center Carol Schacker offered
some encouragement to her teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "Kathy and Donna," she called out, "great job staying with that
little chickie doing the hokey-pokey out there."</TE>
<TE>   This being New England, Kathleen Howley paraphrased John Adams as
her team went down to a 42-0 defeat. "We do not know that we will
win," Howley recalled the patriot's declaring as the American
Revolution began, "but we make ourselves worthy to win."</TE>
<TE>   Never mind, said her teammates as they packed up for a postgame
brunch. "We do like to win," Bilyew said. "But the first thing is,
it's fun. It's thrilling -- and it's really, really fun."</TE>

<HD>Winning Republicans Refrain From Gloating</HD>
<DH>The low-key approach aims to avoid alienating swing voters.
Party leaders say they learned from errors made after their 1994
takeover.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Hook</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>For a party that just made history, Republicans seem remarkably
low-key.</LD>
<LD>   Since they won control of the Senate and expanded their House
majority on election day, President Bush and his fellow Republicans
have deliberately avoided exulting in their victory and unfurling
ambitious partisan plans.</LD>
<LD>   That's not just to be gracious. It is part of a deliberate
strategy to avoid the kind of partisan chest-thumping that could
alienate swing voters who will be crucial to keeping their majority
and reelecting Bush, GOP sources say.</LD>
<TE>   Republicans say they are determined to avoid squandering the
opportunity voters have given them -- as many believe the party did
after the 1994 election gave them control of both the House and
Senate for the first time in 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   The cautious tone also reflects a pragmatic assessment that
tempers postelection euphoria: The GOP may have the majority in the
next House and Senate, but only by wafer-thin margins that are hardly
the stuff of a Republican revolution.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has set the tone from the top. He has modestly refused to
take credit for the gains he worked so hard to achieve.</TE>
<TE>   Asked late last week what he would do with the new power voters
gave Republicans, Bush focused on an agenda of legislative retreads
-- unfinished business of the current Congress, such as homeland
security legislation, federal insurance against damage from terrorist
acts, and appropriation bills. He described the election message not
as an endorsement of his policies or a repudiation of Democratic
ideology, but as something blander: a desire among voters for
"getting things done."</TE>
<TE>   After Tuesday's vote, the Republican National Committee circulated
a memo to congressional Republicans to guide them in analyzing the
election outcome in non-ideological terms.</TE>
<TE>   "The White House has been very careful to make sure we are not
chest-thumping," said a senior GOP congressional aide who asked not
to be named.</TE>
<TE>   It remains to be seen how long Republicans maintain this
circumspect tone. The new Congress will come under heavy pressure to
tack to the right from key party constituencies that expect much from
an all-GOP government.</TE>
<TE>   The American Life League, an anti-abortion group, already has
issued a "pro-life wish list for the new Republican Congress." The
group's proposals include new restrictions on federal money for
international family planning groups.</TE>
<TE>   The Family Research Council, an organization of social
conservatives, tells its members that the election results mean "we
can expect the GOP to advance the social issues agenda," including a
ban on human cloning.</TE>
<TE>   "Conservatives should, however, manage their expectations," the
council's president, Ken Connor, said. "Obstacles remain.... Yet
President Bush, having achieved a historic victory, is in a very
strong position to advance his conservative agenda."</TE>
<TE>   For now, the party line is that Republicans are interested in
accomplishments, not ideology.</TE>
<TE>   "Democrats had a conscious, deliberate strategy to obstruct
things," said Mitch Bainwol, executive director of the National
Republican Senatorial Committee. "We have a conscious, deliberate
strategy to get things done."</TE>
<TE>   To do so, Republicans probably will have to be more willing to
compromise than they were after their stunning sweep of the 1994
elections. Most analysts say Republicans erred in interpreting their
1994 election results as a mandate for radical reduction in the size
of government, rather than largely as a backlash against President
Clinton's first two years in office.</TE>
<TE>   GOP leaders were so confident of their clout that they allowed the
federal government to partially shut down, rather than cut a budget
deal with Clinton. That standoff helped Clinton resuscitate his
political fortunes.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to have learned from our experience in 1994 and try to
get some things done," said Dan Meyer, a lobbyist who was chief of
staff to then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.). "We can't let the
perfect be the enemy of the good."</TE>
<TE>   Even House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas), a leading
conservative who helped push Gingrich's agenda, said: "We learned our
lesson. You can't turn this country around on a dime."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans are also hoping to avoid the mistakes that cost them
their Senate majority in mid-2001, just six months after the 2000
elections gave the GOP control of the White House and both chambers
of Congress for the first time in 46 years. They rammed through the
centerpiece of Bush's agenda, a $1.35-trillion, 10-year tax cut. But
their exuberant commitment to conservative principles was key to
alienating Vermont Sen. James M. Jeffords. His decision to defect
from the party and become an independent cost the GOP its one-seat
Senate majority.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.), in line to regain the Senate majority
leader's job he lost when Jeffords defected, said he has learned from
that experience and will try to run the party in a more inclusive
way.</TE>
<TE>   "I am humbled," he said last week. "I'm not in a gloating sort of
mood. I'm in a mood of getting some results."</TE>
<TE>   David Winston, a GOP pollster, agrees that there is nothing like
losing majority status to make lawmakers more circumspect in managing
the power they have reclaimed.</TE>
<TE>   Moderate Republicans are anxious that GOP leaders not use their
new power to jam through a conservative agenda -- especially since
such centrists as Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, Peter Fitzgerald of
Illinois and George Voinovich of Ohio, are up for reelection in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "If these senators are going to be successful in those states, the
agenda is going to have to be fairly moderate," said centrist Sen.
Lincoln Chafee (R-R.I.).</TE>

<HD>Fiscal Problems Mean No Cakewalk for New Governors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly half the states will start the new year with a new governor,
but the freshmen -- and reelected incumbents too -- are taking
control at a time when their states are facing the most dire
financial prospects in half a century.</LD>
<LD>   At least 23 new governors -- possibly 24, depending on final
results in Alabama -- won election this year, the most since the
National Governors Assn. began tracking in 1982.</LD>
<LD>   Though term limits forced out many incumbents, voters were clearly
in a mood for change. Parties in power were ousted in 16 of the 20
races for open seats.</LD>
<TE>   Now, the men and women elected have to act, and the options
promise to be painful.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the worst fiscal situation since the Second World War," said
Ray Scheppach, executive director of the NGA.</TE>
<TE>   Stopgap measures taken over the last two years sharply limit
choices before the new governors, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They've done the easy and even the moderately difficult cuts,"
along with fee increases and taxes on cigarettes, Scheppach said.
"From here on, you're going to be cutting into real programs that are
going to have effects on people."</TE>
<TE>   Voters chose new faces in nearly two of every three races Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Term limits forced 14 governors out of office, while six chose not
to run. Voters ousted three incumbents, and possibly a fourth --
Alabama Gov. Donald Siegelman has been fighting to reverse what
appears to be a narrow loss. His request for a recount was rejected
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the candidates campaigned on promises that they could
guide their states through a minefield of weakening revenues and
rising health-care costs without raising taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Before the election, others attempted to minimize the pain, or at
least the perception of fiscal problems.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio Gov. Robert A. Taft before the election refused to discuss
potential deficits, despite his opponent's accusation that the state
would be short $4 billion in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Two days after winning reelection, Taft, a Republican,
acknowledged a future problem. "There will be a deficit," he said. He
said it was too early to estimate how big.</TE>
<TE>   In South Carolina, Democratic Gov. Jim Hodges refused to cut
budgets after an economic advisory board predicted a shortfall. He
was defeated.</TE>
<TE>   Hawaii Gov.-elect Linda Lingle, the state's first female governor
and its first GOP chief in 40 years, called for a wholesale audit of
state government. "I could walk in today and find millions of dollars
right off the top without ever getting into a program or the delivery
of service to the public," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But the economic prospects are far from bright. Last year saw
about $50 billion in shortfalls to state budgets, and the latest
estimates project $57 billion more in the current year, Scheppach
said.</TE>
<TE>   With the national economy sputtering and anecdotal reports that
many states are already seeing a return of last year's severe revenue
weakness, good financial news seems far off for state planners.</TE>
<TE>   In the weeks before the elections, most pollsters and analysts
said there was a clear link between the weak performance of
incumbents and the budget problems worrying the states.</TE>
<TE>   "The budget swamp is a treacherous place for state politicians to
be wading around in," said Ron Faucheux, editor of Campaigns &amp;
Elections, a magazine for politicians. "In gubernatorial politics,
when times are tough economically and revenues are falling, that's
where they are -- the budget swamp."</TE>
<TE>   Still, governors-elect are flush with ideas.</TE>
<TE>   Many new and sitting governors will gather in private with the NGA
next weekend in Austin, Texas, to discuss problems and consider
potential solutions.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A bell tolled Saturday for each of the 265 people killed one year ago
in the crash of American Airlines Flight 587, which plunged into a
residential area just after taking off for the Dominican Republic.</LD>
<LD>   Each victim's name was read at a hilltop service in the Astoria
Park section of Queens, where a memorial grove of trees was planted.</LD>
<LD>   "Today is a day of healing. This grove is symbolic of life," said
Randy Daniels, New York's secretary of state.</LD>
<TE>   About 200 people attended the ceremony in the park under the Hell
Gate Bridge, which spans the East River.</TE>
<TE>   Families lined up to take turns shoveling earth into the hole
surrounding one tree.</TE>
<TE>   A companion grove was to be planted at Bani in the Dominican
Republic on Tuesday, the anniversary of the crash.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to even think we're here, because the pain is still so
great," said Yesenia Rivera, 31, whose mother and two aunts died on
the flight.</TE>
<TE>   She walked away weeping, clutching a large color photo of the
three women, who were headed for a vacation in the Dominican
Republic.</TE>
<TE>   The Airbus A300-600, en route from John F. Kennedy International
Airport to Santo Domingo, crashed 103 seconds after takeoff, killing
265 people.</TE>
<TE>   The National Transportation Safety Board is still investigating
the cause. Evidence presented at an NTSB hearing a week ago in
Washington suggests the co-pilot moved the rudder back and forth
before it swerved violently and the plane's tail fin broke off. The
reason for the maneuver has not been determined.</TE>

<HD>Best Defense May Be a Good, Offensive Stench</HD>
<DH>Pamela Dalton works to create foul odors. The Pentagon has
expressed interest in her specialty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Aaron Zitner</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>The eyes get teary and the stomach weak. The gag reflex chokes the
throat. Is that raw sewage? A rotting squirrel? The brain is too
distracted to answer.</LD>
<LD>   Pamela Dalton has uncorked the foulest smell on earth.</LD>
<LD>   It comes from one of the vials that Dalton keeps under a
ventilated hood in her laboratory, where the bottles carry impish
labels: Burned Hair. Bathroom Malodor. And worst of all, Stench Soup,
an odor so reeking of ripe Porta Potties -- or is it dead possum? --
that it fills the mind with white noise.</LD>
<TE>   "That one takes over every aspect of your consciousness," Dalton
says proudly of her creation, made in search of the world's most
offensive odor.</TE>
<TE>   Dalton is an expert in how the body perceives smells, a field
shedding light on the workings of the nervous system, memory and
emotion. But in recent years, her specialty has drawn interest from a
less academic source: the Department of Defense.</TE>
<TE>   Foul odors, it turns out, may be one of the most sensible ways for
military commanders to disperse hostile crowds, empty buildings and
keep intruders away from "no-go" areas. They are one of the most
promising in the new crop of nonlethal weapons, intended to
incapacitate people or equipment while minimizing the risk of death.</TE>
<TE>   Nonlethal weapons are only a small part of the Pentagon's research
and development program, but they received a major endorsement last
week as a panel of the National Research Council called for a big
boost in experimentation and spending. At the top of the panel's
to-do list was increased study of foul smells, or "malodorants."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, some researchers are calling for renewed
investment in nonlethal measures as a result of last month's hostage
standoff in Russia. Authorities there used an opiate gas, intended to
be nonlethal, to subdue armed Chechen guerrillas who had taken over a
Moscow theater. More than 630 hostages were saved, but the gas killed
at least 119 people.</TE>
<TE>   "The Russians ended up having a lot of deaths because they didn't
have adequate technology to act in a nonlethal way," said Larry
Erickson of Kansas State University, which has researched the
environmental effect of malodorants for the Navy. "It's appropriate
for some of these studies to go on to find nonlethal ways to manage a
variety of situations."</TE>
<TE>   But nonlethal weapons could be counterproductive, some critics
say. While seemingly humane, they might prompt an enemy to escalate
the level of violence.</TE>
<TE>   "It's laudable for the military to explore less lethal means of
applying force, but they have to stay out of the chemical and
biological area -- including malodorants," said Edward Hammond of the
Sunshine Project, which opposes chemical weapons.</TE>
<TE>   If the United States pursues odor weapons or even nonlethal
chemicals, other nations would follow suit. Those nonlethal programs,
Hammond said, could easily mask efforts to develop far more deadly
chemical weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The interest in "more humane" weapons dates to at least the 1960s.
But military planners began to take them more seriously in recent
years, as troops increasingly faced hostile civilians on peacekeeping
or humanitarian missions in places such as Haiti, Somalia and
Bosnia-Herzegovina. With TV cameras ready to broadcast civilian
deaths worldwide, soldiers often had to navigate rock-throwing crowds
with only two choices: the bullhorn or the bullet.</TE>
<TE>   A critical boost came in 1995, when Marine Lt. Gen. Anthony Zinni
asked for an infusion of nonlethal weapons, such as rubber bullets,
to help him manage the final withdrawal of United Nations forces from
Somalia. The next year, the Pentagon created an office to focus on
nonlethal weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Now researchers are developing slippery sprays that cause vehicles
to lose traction. Underwater rope barriers could soon protect U.S.
vessels, an attempt to head off disasters like the attack two years
ago on the U.S. destroyer Cole in Yemen by a small boat laden with
explosives.</TE>
<TE>   Lasers and other energy beams are being studied for their ability
to cast a confusing glare, immobilize vehicles or disperse crowds
with a harmless but burning sensation in the skin.</TE>
<TE>   These efforts are tiny by Pentagon standards, with between $20
million and $34 million spent each year, but now the Pentagon is
being urged to do more.</TE>
<TE>   Rubber bullets and similar devices are in the field, but these
target individuals or small groups. "Demand is growing for more
capable systems with wider-ranging effects," said the National
Research Council panel, which advises the government on scientific
matters.</TE>
<TE>   It singled out odor weapons as among the most promising
nonlethals.</TE>
<TE>   Foul smells -- and what makes them offensive -- have been a
longtime interest of Pamela Dalton, a vivacious woman with a broad
smile.</TE>
<TE>   As a 19-year-old undergraduate, Dalton was mugged while visiting a
friend in New York. During the struggle, the assailant put his hand
over Dalton's mouth.</TE>
<TE>   A month later, Dalton was in a friend's home while some children
were gluing a model car. "All of a sudden, I began to feel my heart
racing, and I felt flushed and had to sit down," she recalled. "I was
either having a heart attack or feeling intense anxiety."</TE>
<TE>   Another attack came a few weeks later while Dalton was at the New
Jersey shore, near some people using glues to repair a boat. "This
time, I had more of a feeling that the anxiety had been triggered by
something," Dalton said. She realized that glue odors reminded her of
the mugger.</TE>
<TE>   "My attacker must have been a glue-sniffer," she said. "It wasn't
the odor itself that was making me sick. It was the odor in
association with my life being threatened."</TE>
<TE>   Feeling doubly violated, Dalton set out to re-encode how her body
reacted to the smell of glue. Using her experience with meditation,
she put herself into a relaxed state and then opened a tube of glue,
replacing fearful associations with calm ones.</TE>
<TE>   The experience set Dalton off on her career of studying responses
to odor. Now 46, she is helping the Army understand how diesel fuel
or other smells may touch off anxiety in Persian Gulf War veterans.</TE>
<TE>   The mugging also taught Dalton a lesson that is important for
military research. Odor weapons, she says, would be more like
psychological warfare than chemical warfare.</TE>
<TE>   When inhaled, some substances can burn tissues or send the heart
racing. But these are irritants and drugs, not pure odors, Dalton
says. Odors can cause physical effects, but these come about only
because people have memories or associations with the odor.</TE>
<TE>   The smell of Christmas cookies may bring comfort, while the smell
of sewage might send the heart pounding, thanks probably to a
deep-seated impulse to avoid disease-laden substances.</TE>
<TE>   People can also panic when they don't understand a smell. In one
of many similar episodes after last year's letter-borne anthrax
attacks, two workers in Maine were hospitalized with headaches after
opening a box with an unexpected liquid and a strange smell. Testing
proved it to be tartar sauce.</TE>
<TE>   While Dalton has worked on trying to calm the panic response to
odors, the military has tried to exploit it.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, military researchers developed a repulsive,
fecal-smelling mixture and packed it in a squirt tube. It was given
the humorous name of Who Me?</TE>
<TE>   The goal was to put Who Me? in the hands of French Resistance
fighters, who would spray the material on German officers to
humiliate them.</TE>
<TE>   Whether anyone ever employed it is unclear.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s, one company created a mixture called Go Home, which
in theory would thin the less-motivated people from a rioting crowd.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, researchers at the Army's Edgewood Chemical Biological
Center asked Dalton to revisit the possibilities of foul odors. They
quickly realized that the challenge was to find odors that were
disliked by people of all cultures and ethnicities.</TE>
<TE>   "People like the odors they grew up with, and they don't
necessarily like odors they are unfamiliar with," Dalton said. For
example, durian fruit is a treat in many parts of Asia, while the
smell would chase most Europeans from the room. "To me, it smells
like rotting flesh and garbage," Dalton said.</TE>
<TE>   Through newspaper advertisements, Dalton found whites, blacks,
Latinos and Asian Americans who agreed to sample odors. She also
traveled to South Africa to work with volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Dalton offered a small replay of the odor tests in her
laboratory at the Monell Chemical Senses Center, an independent
research facility here devoted to smell and taste.</TE>
<TE>   First up was a bottle that smelled vaguely like blue cheese. "It's
actually a vomit smell," Dalton said.</TE>
<TE>   "Vomit is a very ambiguous odor, because it has elements of food
in it. There's a lot of variation in how people respond to it."</TE>
<TE>   Then Dalton offered a whiff of the storied Who Me? It smelled like
the repellent odor added to natural gas, with a heavy dose of spoiled
mushrooms.</TE>
<TE>   After a pleasant sniff of vanilla and orange -- a palate cleanser,
so to speak -- Dalton pulled out a bottle marked Bathroom Malodor,
mixed according to a government formula. The odor was invented so
that makers of bathroom cleansers could test their products.</TE>
<TE>   Pee-ew! That was bad.</TE>
<TE>   Bathroom Malodor had a strongly fecal smell, with sharp notes of
spoiled eggs and an undertone of rotting rodent. After a few whiffs,
the stomach churned and an odd feeling gathered in the throat.</TE>
<TE>   In the tests with various ethnic groups, Bathroom Malodor was the
hands-down winner as the most widely reviled smell. "We got cursed in
a lot of different languages," Dalton said. "It was: Get that out of
here!"</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Dalton had not created Stench Soup by the time of
the test. Combining the worst of Bathroom Malodor and Who Me?, that
odor is so distasteful that it chases all thoughts out of the mind.
In informal tests, Dalton's colleagues have found it to be the most
obnoxious odor of all.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it is unclear whether odors could be "weaponized."</TE>
<TE>   First, no one has tested whether the smells are so bad that they
would disperse rioters or cause people to abandon plans to storm an
embassy.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the military would need ways to store and disperse the
malodorant. One possible solution is to encapsulate odor molecules in
small casings, much like cold capsules. The University of New
Hampshire has received Pentagon grants to study the idea.</TE>
<TE>   The military also is considering a nonlethal mortar shell, made
from strips of lightweight carbon fiber, that would not produce
dangerous shrapnel.</TE>
<TE>   Third, an odor weapon would have to meet ethical and legal tests.
The National Research Council panel wrote that it doesn't consider
malodorants to be "chemical weapons," which are outlawed by
international treaty.</TE>
<TE>   But others disagree. "A malodorant is a chemical compound which
exerts a temporary incapacitating effect on people, and in my view
it's a toxic chemical under the Chemical Weapons Convention," said
Mark Wheelis, a microbiologist at UC Davis who has written widely on
chemical weaponry.</TE>
<TE>   Dalton still is studying foul odors, but she is no longer working
for the Pentagon. Still, she may have some pointers for the military.
Occasionally people send her e-mails and letters, eager to share
their ideas for revolting brews.</TE>
<TE>   In one recent message, a man wrote about how he tried to eliminate
a dead raccoon from a roadway by setting it on fire.</TE>
<TE>   "The smell of the smoke made me so sick, I could taste it for
days," he wrote, helpfully adding: "I just thought I would let you
know. Maybe it will give you some ideas or something to go on."</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>When the next Congress convenes in January, two names will be offered
in nomination for speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. One
will be J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.), who will win. The other will be
Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), who will lose.</LD>
<LD>   But for one brief moment, for the first time in 213 years of
American history, a woman will be seriously offered as a candidate
for the most powerful position in Congress, next in line behind the
vice president to succeed a fallen president of the United States.</LD>
<LD>   How Nancy Patricia D'Alesandro Pelosi, 62, came to crash this
glass ceiling of national political life is a story of family
tradition and personal toil.</LD>
<TE>   "I remember her throughout my childhood with a telephone glued to
her ear," said Alexandra, at 32 the youngest of Pelosi's five
children. "In the name of the Democratic Party, she's been on the
phone for 32 years."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the 200-plus members of the House's Democratic Caucus
will gather to elect Pelosi as their leader, the first woman on
either side of the political aisle in either chamber of Congress to
hold that position.</TE>
<TE>   Some say that in picking Pelosi, Democrats are sending the wrong
message. She is a committed liberal who opposes President Bush on
Iraq and is a consistent, thorny voice in trade debates against human
rights violations in China. Detractors say Pelosi is the poster child
for San Francisco liberalism and, at a time when Republicans control
the White House and Congress, only serves to remind voters of support
within the party for such divisive issues as gay marriage, gun
control and labor rights.</TE>
<TE>   But Pelosi is also a tireless campaigner -- she stumped in 30
states and 90 congressional districts for this election, and raised
about $8 million -- and a pragmatist who believes that the key to
winning elections is getting out the vote. Some predict she will be
more like liberal but genial House Speaker Thomas P. "Tip" O'Neill
(D-Mass.) than like firebrand ideologue Speaker Newt Gingrich
(R-Ga.).</TE>
<TE>   Pelosi signaled her own view of leadership in an exuberant victory
announcement Friday. "We will try to find common ground," she said.
"Where we cannot find common ground, we will stand our ground."</TE>
<TE>   To many who have followed Pelosi's odyssey, her success brought a
feeling of redemption.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had 50 years in politics," said a joyous Roz Wyman, at 72
the doyenne of California Democratic politics. "I drove Helen Gahagan
Douglas around in her [1950 Senate] campaign against Richard Nixon.
I've chaired all of Dianne Feinstein's campaigns [for San Francisco
mayor and U.S. senator]. And I never thought I'd live to see what's
happening. Nancy Pelosi is breaking every ceiling that ever existed."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pelosi's father, Thomas D'Alesandro Jr., was a legendary political
figure in Baltimore's Little Italy. He served in Congress for five
terms. She was the youngest of seven children and the only girl. When
she was 7, her father was elected mayor of Baltimore, the first Roman
Catholic to hold the post. And he held it for 12 years. Pelosi fills
her congressional office with pictures of her father, who died in
1987.</TE>
<TE>   Her childhood was a laboratory of public service. The living room
was always filled with bumper stickers, placards and brochures --
except at Christmas or Easter, when the church took priority over
politics. "People would come to the door, and they wanted help," she
recalled in a recent interview. "My father always knew how to refer
people. And they'd end up having dinner at our house, because they
were hungry."</TE>
<TE>   A mayor's life is not all heartwarming vignettes. Pelosi recalls
that once, during a garbage strike, workers threw garbage all over
the front steps -- old orange peels and rotting vegetables. "I
thought, 'What a mean thing to do to my mother,' " she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother, Nancy, was the real grass-roots organizer. She had
wanted to be a lawyer, her granddaughter said, but settled for
running the house, the family and the campaigns. Volunteers were
often in the basement, organizing elections block by block. "My
mother was a boss," Pelosi said. "She wasn't one of the boys, but she
was a boss."</TE>
<TE>   Her brother Thomas D'Alesandro III, himself a mayor of Baltimore,
put it differently. "My father was a consummate politician, but
underneath he was soft," he said. "My mother was tough. Nancy is
tough."</TE>
<TE>   Her six brothers attended St. Leo's parochial school, but Nancy
was sent to the Institute of Notre Dame. For college, she went 35
miles southwest -- as far away as her parents would allow -- to a
women's school, Trinity College, in Washington. She met Paul F.
Pelosi, son of another Catholic political family, when they both took
a class at Georgetown University. They married on her graduation in
1963 and moved to New York, where he began a career in banking. But
Paul Pelosi wanted to return to his home in California, where his
brother served on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. So in 1969,
the couple moved west, and Nancy Pelosi began to do volunteer work
for the Democratic Party.</TE>
<TE>   From the start, she bonded with local Democrats. "I immediately
felt at home," she said. "I was happy. I was surrounded by
Democrats."</TE>
<TE>   She never considered running for office when her children were
small. She had five children -- four daughters and one son -- in six
years. "It would have been impossible," she recalled. "But I was
always a hard-working volunteer."</TE>
<TE>   Her baptism in national politics came in 1976, when Gov. Jerry
Brown ran for president. Pelosi, with her connections in Baltimore,
helped him pull off a surprise win in Maryland's Democratic primary.
"That's the episode that took me out of the kitchen and put me into
official party responsibilities," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Within a few years, she became party chairwoman for Northern
California, joining forces with the political dynasty of Phillip
Burton, who served in Congress for 20 years. When Burton died in
1983, his widow, Sala, won a special election to fill the seat and
was twice reelected. When she was dying of cancer in 1987, she urged
Pelosi to run for her seat.</TE>
<TE>   It was Pelosi's closest race. The governor set an early date for
the special election. "I only had seven weeks to campaign," Pelosi
has recalled. "We had 100 house parties, and we got 4,000 volunteers
to go door to door and to man phone banks. I raised $1 million in
seven weeks."</TE>
<TE>   Her father called every day. She recounted, "He would ask me over
and over, 'Do you have a good organization?' He taught me that
organization is the first lesson in the political primer."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Pelosi's father sent her brother Thomas to check on her.
He returned to Baltimore quickly. "Dad," he told his father, "she's
got a better organization than we ever had."</TE>
<TE>   In that first election, she won 35% to 31% against Supervisor
Harry Britt. She never looked back, routinely winning reelection with
roughly 80% of the vote in a district the Political Almanac calls
"among the two dozen most Democratic and liberal in the nation."</TE>
<TE>   She won assignment to the House Intelligence Committee, where she
recently pushed for a postmortem on CIA lapses leading up to the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and the House Appropriations Committee,
where she steers spending toward education and health care.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Pelosi bested Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), an old
friend of her family, for minority whip, the No. 2 minority
leadership position in the House. Her skill in counting heads stunned
Hoyer -- and much of Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "The minute I decided to enter the race, I decided to win," she
said. "I wasn't going to ask people to support me and do a
halfhearted race."</TE>
<TE>   In the 10 months since assuming that position, she has left a
mixed record. Her creation of not one but two political action
committees was criticized as an unethical attempt to skirt election
spending limits, and she folded one of them. Her support for Rep.
Lynn N. Rivers, a Democrat thrown into a redistricted seat in
Michigan against a fellow Democrat, veteran Rep. John D. Dingell,
also raised eyebrows among those who wondered why she meddled in a
primary. (One clue: Dingell had worked hard for Hoyer.) And a New
York Times columnist recently rapped her fund-raising activities,
saying she helped turn Congress into "a self-lubricating money
machine."</TE>
<TE>   After Democratic losses at the polls on Tuesday, Rep. Richard A.
Gephardt (D-Mo.) announced he would not seek reelection as minority
leader. Pelosi found herself competing against Rep. Martin Frost
(D-Texas) for the top job. The race lasted no more than 48 hours.
Frost's spokesmen were all over the news media, arguing that
moderation was better for what ailed the Democrats than liberalism.
Pelosi was on the phone, securing her votes. Rep. Harold E. Ford Jr.
(D-Tenn.) also threw his hat into the ring Friday, vowing to fight
for the post. In a conference call with reporters Saturday, he said,
"I'm in this race to win." But Pelosi has released a list of 111
Democrats who have publicly pledged to support her.</TE>
<TE>   For 32 years, Pelosi crisscrossed the country almost every weekend
to be home with her constituents and her husband, a successful
businessman who friends say likes to buy her clothes and has been
unfailingly supportive. "My dad is the best sport in this," Alexandra
Pelosi said. "They got lucky."</TE>
<TE>   Of her husband, Pelosi has said, "He understands politics, but he
is not particularly political. He's a businessman. He likes sports.
He plays golf and tennis. He's normal."</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the Pelosis, who have five grandchildren, bought a
condominium on Washington's harbor in Georgetown, with a dramatic
view of the Potomac River. Pelosi has used the venue to entertain
supporters, to reward loyalty.</TE>
<TE>   A major chocoholic (a favorite old sweatshirt says, "Hand over the
chocolate and nobody will get hurt"), the energetic Pelosi cuts a
svelte figure as she races down the halls of Congress, always
fashionably dressed and in high heels. Elle magazine has called her
"a babe."</TE>
<TE>   Alexandra Pelosi, who produced a campy documentary for HBO about
the 2000 George W. Bush campaign called "Journeys With George,"
thinks that this week, when House Democrats crown Nancy Pelosi as
their leader, her mother will be getting her political just desserts.</TE>
<TE>   "I often hear male politicians introduce her, and they always say
how charming she is," Alexandra Pelosi said. "They never say how
hard-working she is. Well, she's worked harder than anybody else.
She's earned it."</TE>
<TE>   In speeches, Pelosi has recalled her first visit to the White
House as part of the congressional leadership team that regularly
meets with the president. Seated at a table with Bush, Vice President
Dick Cheney and all the other power brokers of Congress, she suddenly
became aware that she was the only woman at the table.</TE>
<TE>   She tried to remember Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and
other pioneering women in politics who had made her presence
possible. "I could almost hear them say, 'At least we have a seat at
the table,' " she recalled. "Of course my first thought was, 'We want
more.' "</TE>

<HD>Alaska Pipeline Passed Big Test</HD>
<DH>It was damaged but not ruptured in last week's
7.9-magnitude quake, to engineers' delight.</DH>

<DL>ANCHORAGE</DL>
<LD>The trans-Alaska oil pipeline was designed to withstand an
8.5-magnitude earthquake, but could it?</LD>
<LD>   When a team of structural and geo-technical engineers came up with
the pipeline design in the early 1970s, they didn't expect it to be
tested in their lifetimes. They were wrong.</LD>
<LD>   The 7.9-magnitude earthquake on Nov. 3 -- the worst ever recorded
on the Denali fault in Alaska's interior -- struck in a sparsely
populated area 90 miles south of Fairbanks.</LD>
<TE>   The earthquake -- considered a once-every-600-years event -- left
a 145-mile crack across the landscape and was the first significant
quake to test the pipeline's mettle.</TE>
<TE>   The pipeline withstood the powerful quake just as designed --
damaged but not ruptured, said Doug Nyman, a consulting engineer in
Houston who from 1973 to 1977 was the pipeline's seismic design
coordinator for Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., which operates the
pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   The $8-billion pipeline, completed on May 31, 1977, delivers
approximately 17% of the nation's domestic oil. Nearly 14 billion
barrels of oil have moved through the line.</TE>
<TE>   If anything, last week's powerful earthquake shows that the
pipeline could have withstood more, Nyman said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the earliest tasks was to map the potential for seismic
activity along the pipeline route, which crosses three mountain
ranges, 800 rivers and streams, and three active faults.</TE>
<TE>   Nyman said some of the country's top seismologists and geologists
were brought together. They determined that the greatest potential
for earthquake damage was where the pipeline crossed the Denali fault
and near Valdez, the end of the 800-mile pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   At the Denali fault, engineers designed the pipeline to move if
the earth moved. It was laid close to the ground on a gravel berm and
is supported by shoes that slide on beams. It allows movement of 20
feet horizontally and 5 feet vertically.</TE>
<TE>   "It allows for the fault to rupture. The pipe is floating on these
beams. Those shoes accommodate the new geometry to the ground," Nyman
said.</TE>
<TE>   The pipeline moved 7 1/2 feet horizontally and 2 1/2 feet
vertically. "Compared to what happened, we still have a lot of
capacity there," Nyman said.</TE>
<TE>   Quake damage to the pipeline was right in line with what was
expected, said Jim Lusher, engineering manager for the Joint Pipeline
Office in Anchorage, a consortium of 13 federal and state agencies
that oversees the pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   The shaking broke five aboveground cross beams and at least two
vertical support members. Nine anchors that help restrict horizontal
movement were tripped and a honeycomb of insulating material was
crushed in several places, but the pipeline was not dented, Lusher
said.</TE>
<TE>   Alyeska pressure-tested the line for big leaks before restarting
it Wednesday morning after a 66-hour shutdown. The first tankers were
loaded with oil early Friday morning.</TE>

<HD>Endeavour's Astronauts Appear Set</HD>
<DH>Not since Apollo 13 had health concerns bumped an
astronaut. This time two lost out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.</DL>
<LD>It was bad enough when a medical problem sidelined one astronaut, but
then a back injury forced another off space shuttle Endeavour's
upcoming flight, sending shock waves through the crew.</LD>
<LD>   Not since Apollo 13 had a career astronaut, let alone two, been
bumped from an impending U.S. space shot because of health concerns.</LD>
<LD>   "We were joking a lot about being No. 113," said Kenneth Bowersox,
who at last check was fit for Monday's launch and lengthy space
station stay.</LD>
<TE>   Endeavour's flight to the International Space Station remains
Space Transportation System No. 113. The mission patch plays it safe,
though, and goes with Roman numerals: CXIII.</TE>
<TE>   Seven astronauts will be aboard Endeavour, including eleventh-hour
fill-ins Donald Pettit and Paul Lockhart.</TE>
<TE>   Pettit will spend the winter aboard the space station with
Bowersox and Russian Nikolai Budarin. Lockhart, Endeavour's pilot,
will deliver them and bring back the three who have been living on
the complex since June.</TE>
<TE>   Pettit and Lockhart were upgraded over the summer.</TE>
<TE>   For Apollo 13, the countdown was already underway in 1970 when the
switch in command module pilots occurred. Thomas "Ken" Mattingly was
exposed to German measles and replaced by Jack Swigert on what was to
become an even more star-crossed mission.</TE>
<TE>   Pettit was training in Russia as the space station backup for
Donald Thomas when Bowersox broke the news in July: Pettit was in and
Thomas was out. NASA's medical experts had been debating for months
whether Thomas should be grounded because of an undisclosed issue and
finally ordered that the two Donalds be swapped.</TE>
<TE>   "It was one of those things that was right on the line," said
Bowersox, the expedition commander.</TE>
<TE>   "I had trouble sleeping before it happened because I was so
worried about which way we should go and what was right and what was
wrong and the best way to handle it."</TE>
<TE>   A couple weeks later, in August, shuttle pilot Christopher "Gus"
Loria became the second casualty after hurting his back at home.
Because Lockhart had just flown to the space station on Endeavour in
June, NASA asked him to step in.</TE>
<TE>   Lockhart told his flabbergasted wife, who had been planning their
vacation: "There's no need to finish getting the passports. We're not
going to Germany and Austria."</TE>
<TE>   For Bowersox, the pilot swap was "an even bigger shock" than
having Pettit suddenly on board. Bowersox and his station crew were
still in Russia and had no clue anything was amiss.</TE>
<TE>   Pettit and his wife, meanwhile, were stunned by their own turn of
events -- although perhaps less so since he had been training all
along as a backup.</TE>
<TE>   But the effect on their lives was greater since Pettit was
departing on a four-month station mission, rather than an 11-day
shuttle flight. For starters, he was going to miss his twin boys'
second birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Worse yet, NASA already had delivered the meals and clothes for
the upcoming space station crew, leaving Pettit stuck with Thomas'
selections.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas filled his advance shipments with chocolate, but no coffee.</TE>
<TE>   Pettit needs two cups of java a day and craves green chili, not
chocolate. So he's stashed instant coffee and northern New Mexico's
finest green chili aboard Endeavour.</TE>

<HD>The Proper Vote on El Toro</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of these years, Orange County will stage an election that won't
force voters to weigh in yet again on El Toro.</LD>
<LD>   No, this wasn't the year.</LD>
<LD>   Residents who bucked the national trend toward ignoring the Nov. 5
election had two airport-related votes to cast. They did the right
thing on both counts.</LD>
<TE>   Voters soundly rejected Proposition 51, the statewide measure that
masqueraded as a traffic congestion relief package. The proposition
would have pushed funding for select projects -- including about $120
million for the Great Park -- to the front of the line. El Toro
figured into the Proposition 51 equation in large part because Irvine
Mayor Larry Agran, the Great Park's godfather, sits on the board of
the Planning and Conservation League, a coalition that sponsored the
proposition.</TE>
<TE>   We'll repeat what we said before the election: The proposition was
ill-conceived. The title alone -- the Traffic Congestion Relief and
Safe School Bus Trust Fund -- told voters what was wrong, because
just 8% of the $250 million fund would have gone toward school buses.</TE>
<TE>   But pro-airport forces shouldn't try to cast Proposition 51's
defeat as a referendum on the Great Park concept. That issue was
settled back in March when county residents voted not to build an
airport.</TE>
<TE>   The second El Toro issue was Measure B, an advisory vote that not
so politely reminded the Navy to clean up the former Marine base.
Voters had little to lose by supporting Measure B because cleanup is
a necessary step at a base that merits a place on the federal
Superfund list as one of the nation's most polluted sites. What's
uncertain is whether anyone in Washington will listen to the county's
advice. Supporters argue that the very public call for a full cleanup
will resonate in Washington. We hope they're right.</TE>
<TE>   The first Tuesday in November wasn't just about El Toro. Voters,
perhaps confused by awkward wording, voted down Measure A, which
would have updated the county's proven campaign-spending law. Santa
Ana for the first time elected a Latino-majority City Council.</TE>
<TE>   Former Assembly Speaker Curt Pringle found a second act on the
political stage; former county Supervisor Roger Stanton wasn't so
fortunate. Voters once again showed that education is a priority,
approving a boatload of school bonds.</TE>
<TE>   One election-night story that lingers involves Office 21 of the
Superior Court, a race that continued on a curious course even after
the incumbent withdrew from the race to deal with allegations that he
had molested a teenager and downloaded child pornography.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's winner was an enigmatic write-in candidate who boycotted
a public debate that showcased judicial candidates and refused to sit
for a peer review by the county bar association. John Adams won the
election, but he still should stand up and answer the questions about
his resume that arose during the campaign.</TE>

District.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's constant search for new sources of water reminds me of
the famous line from the classic poem "Rime of the Ancient Mariner,"
by Samuel Taylor Coleridge: "Water, water everywhere, nor any drop to
drink."</LD>
<LD>   It is the frustrated cry of a desperate sailor who senses the
irony that he is dying of thirst at sea, surrounded by undrinkable
water. A similar lament has also been repeated for generations by
Southern Californians as we beg, borrow and deal for the clean
drinking water that we so desperately need, despite our proximity to
the ocean.</LD>
<LD>   Our water supply is dwindling, and our growing population is only
increasing the problem. The federal government has given California a
deadline to reduce by 800,000 acre-feet annually its share of
Colorado River water--which means the water supply for about 1.6
million California families will soon evaporate.</LD>
<TE>   Farmers and environmentalists have teamed up in an attempt to
reduce the amount of water Southern California imports from Northern
California. To make matters worse, the Orange County Water District
announced that the Orange County aquifer, which stores our
groundwater, has been overdrafted by 133 billion gallons.</TE>
<TE>   All of this is compounded by the fact that we are in the midst of
a drought with no end in sight. This "Perfect Storm" of water trouble
led to a recent Los Angeles Times story warning of a potential
increase in water bills as our water supply shrinks.</TE>
<TE>   Although we probably won't be using green paint to brighten our
dead lawns any time soon, some responsible, long-term planning is in
order. Orange County needs to develop new local water sources so that
we are not so reliant on imported water.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of cursing the darkness, let's try lighting a few candles.</TE>
<TE>   Four days before The Times story about the overdraft in our local
groundwater basin, the newspaper reported that the California
Department of Health Services had granted preliminary approval for a
proposed desalination facility in Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   This nonpolluting facility would process enough seawater to
produce 50 million gallons of fresh drinking water every day. That's
more than 18 billion gallons of clean water annually, or enough to
serve about 112,000 Orange County households. Desalination uses the
same purifying process that bottled-water companies use.</TE>
<TE>   Just as the prices of electronics have plummeted in recent years,
desalination has become more affordable with advances in technology.
The cost for desalinated water is now comparable to the costs of
other new sources of high-quality drinking water.</TE>
<TE>   However, as supplies decrease and demand rises, there is no
question that water bills will increase. To put it in perspective,
most families spend more for cable TV than for water and wastewater
services.</TE>
<TE>   We need to appreciate the value of clean drinking water, which is
a limited resource.</TE>
<TE>   We also have the opportunity to implement the Groundwater
Replenishment System, which has been jointly proposed by the county
water and sanitation districts. This recycled water will cost less
than the imported water upon which we now are so reliant.</TE>
<TE>   If we can use reclaimed water to irrigate crops, water golf
courses and parks, and recharge our overdrawn aquifer, then our other
clean water sources -- including desalination, groundwater and
imported water -- will ensure Orange County a sufficient supply of
drinking water.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to developing new water sources and effectively
managing our existing ones, conservation is an important component to
avoiding a water crisis. Southern California residents have been
practicing conservation since our last major drought in 1992, but
more can be done.</TE>
<TE>   Water industry experts and Metropolitan Water District officials
estimate water consumption could be reduced by 10% by not
overwatering lawns, washing only full loads in our washing machines
and dishwashers and adopting other common-sense water conservation
habits.</TE>
<TE>   Even with new water sources and incorporating water conservation
measures, we will still need imported water. However, by developing
new local water resources such as desalination, we become more
independent and less reliant on water from Northern California and
the Colorado River.</TE>
<TE>   Just as it is important to diversify one's financial portfolio, it
is equally important to have a diverse water portfolio.</TE>
<TE>   We need to implement all these alternatives in order to guarantee
that Orange County will continue to have affordable access to local,
reliable, high-quality drinking water. If we move forward
implementing all our alternatives, we can turn Coleridge's poem
around and proudly exclaim, "Water, water everywhere, and now it's
ours to drink!"</TE>

Claremont McKenna College and author of "The Art of Political

<DL></DL>
<LD>Arnold Schwarzenegger came to Chapman University shortly before the
election to discuss his after-school initiative for MSNBC's
"Hardball" talk show. Schwarzenegger told "Hardball" host Chris
Matthews that the last time he visited Chapman --to pick up an
honorary degree -- "I said when I left, 'I'll be back.' Right, well,
I'm back."</LD>
<LD>   He'll be back again. Though he had to cancel this month's
appearance at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, people in the
area will see a good deal of him in the years ahead. And not just in
the theaters.</LD>
<LD>   On election night, Schwarzenegger was a bigger winner than Gray
Davis. Not only did his ballot proposition triumph, but the GOP's
poor showing left the party longing for a champion. In four years,
Republicans may turn to him as their candidate for governor.</LD>
<TE>   If they do, Orange County will be one of his major bases of
support. Some local conservatives grumble about his support for
abortion rights, but he is immune to their favorite epithet for
Republican moderates. Nobody calls this man a "squish."</TE>
<TE>   Schwarzenegger has qualities that the state party has been
missing. The first is a reputation for "compassionate conservatism."
He has long worked on children's causes, such as the Special Olympics
and the Inner-City Games. The first President Bush named him to head
the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, where he
became a national spokesman for physical education. This record made
him a credible sponsor of the initiative. Significantly, the
proposition's Web address was www.joinarnold.com.</TE>
<TE>   After-school programs are a popular idea, so the measure drew a
rainbow coalition of endorsements. Orange County supporters included
Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, state Sen. Dick Ackerman, and
Sheriff Michael S. Carona, a potential candidate for lieutenant
governor. It also had the backing of Democrats such as Irvine Mayor
Larry Agran.</TE>
<TE>   When Chris Matthews noted that some Democrats were withholding
support, Schwarzenegger waved him off, saying, "Let's all get
together and make this pass and do something for the children."
That's an appealing message for voters who've seen enough sharp-edged
ideologues.</TE>
<TE>   His accent is another plus. The GOP's anti-immigration image has
hurt it among naturalized citizens, a growing force in Orange County.
Who could better mend this damage than a fellow immigrant? Like a
Middle European version of Ronald Reagan, Schwarzenegger speaks
movingly about what the American dream meant to a young man from a
modest home in Austria.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarzenegger brings Reaganesque excitement and Hollywood glamour
to his public appearances.</TE>
<TE>   That's a change from the recent run of state Republican leaders.
Can you picture a George Deukmejian action figure? A Bill Simon video
game? On second thought, the latter is a possibility. Players would
compete to make the most mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   Celebrity has drawbacks. In a run for office, Schwarzenegger would
have to answer for the high body count in his movies. By the way,
Santa Ana's MainPlace mall was the filming site for the opening of
"Kindergarten Cop." (With only one killing, the MainPlace sequence
was relatively tame.)</TE>
<TE>   Celebrity also brings out the tabloids. When newspapers reported
that Schwarzenegger might run in 2002, Democratic strategist Garry
South provided the press with a magazine article making salacious
personal charges. Some observers say South may have deterred
Schwarzenegger from running.</TE>
<TE>   There's another possibility. Maybe Schwarzenegger deliberately
raised the possibility of a 2002 race to see how enemies would go
after him in 2006. Now that South has revealed the outlines of his
attack plan, Schwarzenegger has four years to figure out his
responses. If you doubt that Schwarzenegger is capable of such
calculation, see "Pumping Iron," the 1977 documentary that made him a
star. (An enhanced version premieres Friday on Cinemax). Even as a
young bodybuilder, the film shows, he was already waging
psychological warfare on opponents.</TE>
<TE>   The former Mr. Universe is literally the embodiment of
self-discipline. This fall, he campaigned for his initiative with the
same single-mindedness he once applied to his abs and pecs. He
mastered the policy details, stuck to his message and deftly
sidestepped questions about other issues. If Bill Simon had such
discipline, he'd have the governorship -- and big biceps too.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarzenegger also has a knack for making friends in high places
-- very high places. Calling Schwarzenegger a "Miracle Man," the Rev.
Robert H. Schuller let him promote the initiative in the Crystal
Cathedral, the first such event in the cathedral's history.</TE>
<TE>   The actor's charm extends to the rank and file. During the
"Hardball" appearance, a Chapman student posed a probing question
about the initiative's limitations. "First of all," he responded, "I
want to congratulate you for a great question." Matthews then
cracked, "And you're not a politician, right?"</TE>
<TE>   Arnold Schwarzenegger is not just the Terminator. He's the
Natural.</TE>

<HD>He Worries About His Limitations, Not the Statue</HD>

<DL>PALO ALTO</DL>
<LD>His team had just cruised to its fourth consecutive victory, he had
secured another USC career quarterback record and yet Carson Palmer
seemed ... irked.</LD>
<LD>   He kept bringing up mistakes, both his own and his team's. He made
it sound as if the Trojans were underachieving.</LD>
<LD>   Good. A great player has to be, as Method Man once rapped, "Never
satisfied, like the Stones." The whole reason Palmer is putting up
breakthrough and, yes, Heisman-consideration numbers is that he
wasn't happy with his performance in his first three-plus seasons at
USC.</LD>
<TE>   Just because he has thrown for 2,700 yards and 22 touchdowns and
his Trojans are 7-2 after Saturday's 49-17 victory at Stanford, don't
think it means he's content.</TE>
<TE>   "I expected to be undefeated," he said. "I expected to lead this
team to a victory every time we played. But I'm not mad.... As long
as we're winning, I'm happy.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be perfect. I want to play perfect every game."</TE>
<TE>   Guess that means he won't take this comment from Coach Pete
Carroll as a compliment: "He played close to perfect today."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer completed 22 of 32 passes for 317 yards and four
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "He did everything we needed him to do," Carroll said. "I thought
he was terrific."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll's lone complaint was a second-quarter play when Palmer
rolled out, dropped back, held onto the ball too long and took a
26-yard sack on third-and-four. He even fumbled but jumped on the
ball at his own 10-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer called it a "stupid play."</TE>
<TE>   But teams can win when the stupid plays are singular, not plural.
Bad decisions, bad passes and turnovers by Palmer would have been the
only way for this overmatched Stanford team to win. Palmer didn't
throw an interception Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   And after throwing as many interceptions as touchdowns (39) before
this year, his touchdown-to-interception ratio is almost 3:1 for
2002. His four touchdowns Saturday gave him 61 for his career,
surpassing Rob Johnson's school record of 58.</TE>
<TE>   That means Palmer holds every career quarterbacking record that
matters at USC, including yardage and completions. Yes, he has had
the rare privilege of starting since his freshman year, and one of
his records (most pass attempts) has helped him set the others.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, his job has been simplified. A lot of his completions and
yardage consist of throwing a pass to Mike Williams near the line of
scrimmage, then letting Williams take off and break a tackle or two.</TE>
<TE>   "The game plan's been so easy," Palmer said. "Just throw a lot of
quick stuff until they take away our quick routes, our quick slants
and stuff like that. The game plan was real easy this week."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer got a chance to show his skills when he went over the top
for a 17-yard touchdown pass to Keary Colbert for USC's first score,
and when he hit Kareem Kelly in stride down the sidelines for a
50-yard gain in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   "He's confident in the players that are around him and he feels
good about what he's doing," offensive coordinator Norm Chow said.
"What more can you ask?"</TE>
<TE>   How about putting some more points on the board? That's what
Palmer wants.</TE>
<TE>   "We shoot ourselves in the foot all the time," he said. "We should
score every drive. We have opportunities to score every drive....
[It's] just little mental errors."</TE>
<TE>   It's tough to find fault with an offense on a team that has scored
40-plus points in three consecutive games. And Palmer is at the heart
of it, coming off a 448-yard, five-touchdown game at Oregon and
throwing 13 TD passes in the three games.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel more confident and more comfortable, just from the
experience," Palmer said. "We've played nine games now, so I'm nine
games better than I was in the first game."</TE>
<TE>   He might even be good enough to get a trip to New York for the
Heisman Trophy presentation, if enough Eastern media people are
paying attention.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't get half the credit nationwide that he deserves,"
Williams said. "Everyone that follows SC knows how good he is. He's
showing it. He's playing good ball. What he did in the last couple
weeks is what we need."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer's thoughts on the stiff-arming statuette?</TE>
<TE>   "It would be awesome, it would be nice, but I'm really not
concerned with that," he said. "It would definitely be an honor, but
I want to go to a big bowl. I want to go to a BCS bowl. I really want
Washington State to lose and get a chance to go to the Rose Bowl. I
really want to beat UCLA my last year and I want to beat Notre Dame
bad. Any awards or personal accolades isn't my concern right now."</TE>
<TE>   If he can just satisfy his own demands, that ought to be enough.</TE>

<HD>Making the Cubs Winners? Now, That's a Giant Task</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beyond all the complexities leading to Dusty Baker's departure as
manager of the San Francisco Giants, all the schoolyard sensitivities
that Baker and managing general partner Peter Magowan allowed to
become irreparable, there had to be a belief by Baker that he had led
the thirtysomething Giants as far as they could go, that it might be
a long time before they returned for Game 1 of the World Series, let
alone Game 7.</LD>
<LD>   "Sometimes people want to look for this problem or that problem,"
Baker said privately on the eve of a World Series that culminated his
10-year tenure. "Sometimes long enough is simply long enough."</LD>
<LD>   That sweeping perspective addressed several issues, including the
fact that the Giants of next March may have no resemblance to the
Giants of October.</LD>
<TE>   Barry and the Seven Dwarfs? Well, Baker knew that could become a
reality if the Giants can't retain Jeff Kent and Kenny Lofton, along
with David Bell and Reggie Sanders, who are now free agents through
mutual option agreements.</TE>
<TE>   That's half of the starting lineup and that's before the Giants
contemplate the alarming uncertainty of closer Robb Nen's 2003
availability after shoulder surgery Friday.</TE>
<TE>   All of that may not deter a top managerial candidate named Jim
Fregosi, the San Francisco native who is a close friend and former
assistant of Giant General Manager Brian Sabean and who said from his
Florida home that he would "love to return to the Bay Area and manage
a team" he still considers to be a contender for an ownership he
respects.</TE>
<TE>   If that's all in the eye of the beholder, if Baker was worried
about the Giants' competitiveness next year and beyond (putting aside
the issue of respect), the question now is: When was the last decade
in which the Chicago Cubs were considered to be consistently
competitive?</TE>
<TE>   Unless the Boston Red Sox suddenly become a player, Baker is
expected to finalize a deal with the Cubs by mid-week, providing he
is assured of input into personnel decisions and ownership is
committed to building a winner while Sammy Sosa is still breathing.</TE>
<TE>   The Cubs were 67-95 last year. They lost 36 games by one run
because of an offense that ranked 15th among the 16 National League
teams and a bullpen that blew more saves (25) than it registered
(23). They have a vacuum at third base (unless Baker can bring Bell
with him), have to hope that Hee Seop Choi and Bobby Hill are ready
to play full time at first and second base, are still waiting for
center fielder Corey Patterson to fulfill expectations, remain
saddled with overpaid and underachieving Todd Hundley and Moises Alou
and are counting on former USC star Mark Prior to perform like an
ace.</TE>
<TE>   Baker would also be confronting the Cub curse and a more caustic
talk show and media environment than he complained about in the Bay
Area.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, everyone needs a new challenge, and long enough is
long enough.</TE>
<TE>   Monkey Business</TE>
<TE>   An entourage led by Mexican billionaire Carlos Peralta bivouacked
at a Beverly Hills hotel last week while Peralta continued his
pursuit of the Angels. High-ranking baseball officials said Peralta,
if successful, would like to play an annual regular-season series in
Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, Disney officials also continue to meet with theater
impresarios James and Robert Nederlander. Industry officials have
speculated that the Nederlanders could ultimately merge with a group
led by Peter Ueberroth, but a person close to the Nederlanders said
he doubts they'd be interested in allying.</TE>
<TE>   "The Nederlanders would certainly have partners, but not in the
form of another group," he said. "They don't need another group."</TE>
<TE>   Boston Beane?</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Billy Beane has talked the Oakland A's owners into
letting him hear what the Red Sox have to offer. Boston President
Larry Lucchino has interviewed seven GM candidates while dumping on
his interim GM, Mike Port, and never giving up on Beane. The latter
has long said he is reluctant to leave the West Coast, but he is also
suspected of tiring of the good fight in Oakland, worries that Miguel
Tejada will lead the next player exodus, and thinks it might be time
to pursue a richer climate himself. Beane has six years left on his
contract, however, and the A's will demand a steep price in player
compensation.</TE>
<TE>   GM Meetings</TE>
<TE>   Under the canopy of tightening payrolls and a new,
semi-restrictive bargaining agreement, major league general managers
begin their four-day annual meeting in Tucson on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   For Dodger General Manager Dan Evans, with 12 players under
contract at $95 million next year and the club determined not to
exceed the $117.5-million tax threshold (which includes 40-man roster
and benefit payments, meaning the Dodgers are much closer to the
threshold than even $95 million would indicate), it is difficult to
envision any creative avenues for improving the offense with no
market interest in Eric Karros or Mark Grudzielanek and $26 million
owed to pitchers Kevin Brown and Darren Dreifort, both question
marks.</TE>
<TE>   "Danny is going to have to pull a rabbit out of the hat if he's
going to make the type of move that would give Shawn Green some
support and really improve that offense," said an agent claiming to
be familiar with Evans' frustration.</TE>
<TE>   Evans said it isn't frustration as much as a creative challenge.
He added: "Realistically, we know that we can't accomplish everything
we'd like to do."</TE>
<TE>   One thing the Dodgers should be able to do is add a left-hander to
the bullpen even if Jesse Orosco is re-signed. The Angels may also be
seeking a southpaw reliever with Scott Schoeneweis expected to
re-state his desire to start, leading to a probable trade request.</TE>
<TE>   Agent Scott Boras said he wouldn't discuss the situation until he
meets with General Manager Bill Stoneman.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise?</TE>
<TE>   With Stoneman's World Series winner returning virtually intact and
the payroll expected to take a major hit in the process, the Angels
have it easy.</TE>
<TE>   Barring a DH search if he does not offer a contract to Brad
Fullmer, who received $3.5 million in 2002 and is arbitration
eligible, Stoneman admitted that he doesn't have a pressing need
beyond outfield depth if free agents Alex Ochoa and Orlando Palmeiro
are not re-signed.</TE>

<HD>Oklahoma Can't Repeat Feat at Texas A&amp;M</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oklahoma escaped Kyle Field two years ago, clearing the way for the
Sooners to win the national title.</LD>
<LD>   They couldn't pull off another victory against Texas A&amp;M on
Saturday at College Station, Texas, and now the No. 1-ranked Sooners
might not get another shot to win it all after a 30-26 loss to the
Aggies.</LD>
<LD>   "I never talked about it when we had a BCS future. I don't know
that we have one now and don't really care," Coach Bob Stoops said.</LD>
<TE>   The Sooners, 8-1 overall and 4-1 in the conference, certainly will
drop from their top position in both the Associated Press poll and
the bowl championship series standings.</TE>
<TE>   No. 2-ranked Miami had an easy 26-3 win at Tennessee on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The Aggies (6-4, 3-3) beat a No. 1 team for the first time in
school history behind freshman reserve quarterback Reggie McNeal, who
completed eight of 13 passes for 191 yards and four touchdowns and
rushed for 89 yards in 16 carries.</TE>
<TE>   McNeal had scoring passes on three straight possessions to give
Texas A&amp;M its first lead. His fourth touchdown pass, a 40-yarder to
Terrence Murphy with 1 minute 51 seconds remaining in the third
quarter, put the Aggies ahead, 27-23, before the teams traded field
goals in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Terrence Kiel, who was burned for an earlier touchdown,
intercepted Nate Hybl's pass with 1:12 left to seal the victory.</TE>
<TE>   When the Sooners won the national championship two years ago, they
arrived at College Station coming off three impressive wins over top
25 teams. Then they overcame a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter
to beat the Aggies, 35-31, propelling them to the national title
game.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma was trying to follow the same path this time, having
beaten Texas, Iowa State and Colorado in its previous three games.
But the Aggies and McNeal didn't cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   Texas A&amp;M broke a three-game losing streak at Kyle Field, where it
lost only four times in the 1990s. They had blown fourth-quarter
leads of 18 and 17 points in their last two home games.</TE>
<TE>   The struggles had put Aggie Coach R.C. Slocum under intense
pressure. But this one victory -- before a mostly maroon-clad crowd
of 84,036 -- may go a long way in lowering the heat on the 14th-year
coach.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been one of those challenge years," Slocum said. "It's
gratifying to go in and play with the No. 1 team in a game where
virtually no one gave us a chance to win. It is satisfying. This is
pretty big."</TE>
<TE>   Slocum can thank his sensational freshman quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   McNeal replaced struggling starter Dustin Long, who completed only
three of nine passes for 28 yards and an interception, on the final
possession of the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   After the Aggies went three-and-out on his first possession, and
Oklahoma then drove for a field goal and a 10-0 lead, McNeal was
almost unstoppable.</TE>
<TE>   Hybl completed 20 of 34 passes for 249 yards and two touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Quentin Griffin had his fifth straight 100-yard rushing game but
had only 29 of his 141 yards after halftime.</TE>
<TE>   No. 4 Texas 41, Baylor 0 -- Roy Williams had eight receptions for
172 yards, including a 73-yard touchdown on the second play, to lead
the Longhorns at Austin, Texas. Chris Simms completed 18 of 23 passes
for 254 yards and three touchdowns for Texas (9-1, 5-1), which led,
31-0, at halftime. Baylor is 3-7, 1-5.</TE>
<TE>   No. 12 Kansas State 58, No. 21 Iowa State 7 -- Bobby Walker
intercepted two Seneca Wallace passes and returned them for
touchdowns 23 seconds apart as the Wildcats (8-4, 4-2) won in a rout
at Manhattan, Kan. Wallace, who had a school-record 493 yards of
total offense the week before against Missouri, completed 11 of 26
passes for 162 yards and three interceptions. He had only four yards
rushing.</TE>
<TE>   The Cyclones are 7-4, 4-3.</TE>
<TE>   No. 18 Colorado 42, Missouri 35 -- Chris Brown rushed for 211
yards in 35 carries and scored his third touchdown on a one-yard run
in overtime to help the Buffaloes win at Columbia, Mo. On Missouri's
overtime possession, Darius Outlaw caught a pass on third and 10, but
he fumbled after being hit by J.J. Billingsley. Kory Mossoni
recovered for Colorado (7-3, 5-1).</TE>
<TE>   Missouri (4-6, 1-5) trailed, 27-7, in the third quarter before
rallying to force overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Texas Tech 49, Oklahoma State 24 -- Kliff Kingsbury completed 38
of 49 passes for 425 yards and four touchdowns to become the No. 5
passer in NCAA Division I history and help the Red Raiders (7-4, 4-2)
win at Lubbock, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma State is 4-5, 2-3.</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska 45, Kansas 7 -- Freshman David Horne ran for 122 yards in
only nine carries to help Nebraska (7-4, 3-3) win at Lincoln, Neb.
Kansas is 2-9, 0-7.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brad Banks is the main reason Iowa is hanging around the cluttered
race for those coveted Bowl Championship Series spots.</LD>
<LD>   He threw for three touchdowns and ran for two more, leading the
sixth-ranked Hawkeyes to their eighth straight victory Saturday,
62-10, over Northwestern at Iowa City, Iowa.</LD>
<LD>   Banks made the most of his chances during his final home game for
the Hawkeyes, 10-1 overall and 7-0 in the conference. The nation's
leader in passing efficiency completed all 10 of his attempts for 197
yards. It was the third consecutive game he did not throw an
interception.</LD>
<TE>   The Hawkeyes held the Wildcats (3-8, 1-6) to 100 yards rushing,
and Northwestern quarterbacks threw for only 199 yards with three
interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   No. 13 Michigan 41, Minnesota 24 -- John Navarre passed for 225
yards and two touchdowns and B.J. Askew rushed for 126 yards in only
11 carries as the Wolverines (8-2, 5-1) handled the Golden Gophers
(7-3, 3-3) at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan had 478 total yards and took control by scoring 24
consecutive points in a seven-minute span in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   The Wolverines haven't lost to Minnesota since 1986 and have never
been defeated in the Metrodome.</TE>
<TE>   No. 19 Penn State 35, Virginia 14 -- Zack Mills threw two
touchdown passes as the Nittany Lions (7-3) defeated the Cavaliers
(6-4) in a nonconference game at State College, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   Mills completed 19 of 30 passes for 227 yards, his first 200-yard
game since throwing for 264 yards in a 27-24 overtime loss at
Michigan on Oct. 12.</TE>
<TE>   Penn State's Larry Johnson had 31 carries for 188 yards and one
touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan State 56, Indiana 21 -- Damon Dowdell, Charles Rogers and
the rest of the beleaguered Spartans (4-6, 2-4) made Morris Watts'
head coaching debut a success with a victory over the Hoosiers (3-7,
1-5) at Bloomington, Ind.</TE>
<TE>   Starting for the third straight game in place of suspended
quarterback Jeff Smoker, Dowdell passed for four touchdowns and ran
for another score as the Spartans ended a four-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers set a school record with his 24th and 25th career touchdown
receptions.</TE>
<TE>   Illinois 37, Wisconsin 20 -- Jon Beutjer returned to the lineup
and threw four touchdown passes and the Fighting Illini (4-6, 3-3)
overcame five turnovers to defeat the Badgers (6-5, 1-5) at Madison,
Wis.</TE>
<TE>   Antoineo Harris rushed 40 times for 158 yards as Illinois kept its
bowl hopes alive while delivering a blow to the Badgers' postseason
chances.</TE>

<DL>COLLEGE STATION, Texas</DL>
<LD>The sounds of buzzing chain saws and toppling trees filled a nearby
forest Saturday as Texas A&amp;M students and alumni worked to revive
their bonfire tradition, on hold since a deadly collapse in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Wearing colored hard hats signifying leadership positions and
wielding axes and machetes, the volunteers searched the woods east of
College Station for dead elm trees to cut down and eventually burn.</LD>
<LD>   They plan to light a 10- to 15-foot-high, off-campus bonfire Nov.
24.</LD>
<TE>   University officials are discouraging the effort to resume the
90-year-old A&amp;M tradition, on hold since a 59-foot-high bonfire
collapsed while under construction in 1999, killing 12 people and
injuring 27 others.</TE>
<TE>   "Our concerns primarily are one of safety -- safety for our
students and for anyone else who might be involved. No university
representation will be authorized for any such activity," A&amp;M
spokesman Lane Stephenson said.</TE>

<HD>Giguere Returns to Comfort Level</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Panic never entered the picture. Concern, on the other hand, was in
living color.</LD>
<LD>   Mighty Duck goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere was playing at a level
that made him and Coach Mike Babcock uncomfortable. Giguere, drafted
13th overall by Hartford in 1995, had finally blossomed last season
into a top goalie.</LD>
<LD>   After a shaky start, that assessment has returned. Giguere stopped
28 of 30 shots -- 15 of 16 in the first period -- giving the Ducks a
chance to rally for a 3-2 overtime victory over Colorado on Friday.</LD>
<TE>   "I brought my battle level a little higher," Giguere said. "That
was lacking [earlier this season]. I feel better right now."</TE>
<TE>   He should.</TE>
<TE>   Giguere was one of the best-kept secrets in the NHL last season.
His 2.13 goals-against average was fifth in the NHL. His .920 save
percentage was tied for fifth.</TE>
<TE>   But he struggled in those areas at the start of this season.
Giguere had an .890 save percentage through the first eight games.
His record was 1-5-2.</TE>
<TE>   That has turned around. Giguere has given up seven goals in his
last three starts and has stopped 101 of 108 shots, a .935 save
percentage.</TE>
<TE>   "That what he's suppose to be like," Babcock said. "All he needs
to do is feel good. The next thing you know we're off to the races."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Avalanche defenseman Rob Blake sat out Friday's game against the
Ducks. He was not missed by the Ducks, especially by Paul Kariya.</TE>
<TE>   "You always have to be aware of him out there," Kariya said. "He
has that butt check that can kill you."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   vs. Minnesota, 5</TE>
<TE>   Channel 9</TE>
<TE>   Site -- Arrowhead Pond.</TE>
<TE>   Radio -- KPLS (830).</TE>
<TE>   Records -- Ducks 5-6-3-0, Wild 10-3-2-0.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Wild (2001-02) -- 2-1-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update -- A victory would give the Ducks a .500 record. The Ducks
have not been above .500 this deep into the season since the last day
of the 1999-2000 season.</TE>

<LD>Freshman Damien Rhodes scored on a 25-yard run and ran for the
two-point conversion in the third overtime Saturday night, giving
Syracuse a 50-42 victory over No. 8 Virginia Tech at Syracuse, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   Virginia Tech, 8-2 overall and 3-2 in the Big East Conference,
lost despite 504 yards passing and a school-record five touchdown
passes from Bryan Randall. Randall's yardage total was the
second-best in school history, behind Don Strock's 527-yard
performance against Houston in 1972.</LD>
<LD>   It was the second consecutive loss for the Hokies and the third
win in a row for the Orangemen (4-6, 2-3), who also beat Virginia
Tech at Blacksburg, Va., last year.</LD>
<TE>   Virginia Tech's chance to tie the score ended when Maurice McClain
intercepted Randall's pass in the left corner of the end zone,
sending the near-sellout crowd into a frenzy.</TE>
<TE>   Randall completed 23 of 35 passes -- having three intercepted --
and Ernest Wilford had eight catches for 279 yards and four
touchdowns. Syracuse's quarterback Troy Nunes was 24 for 40 for a
career-high 403 yards and one touchdown with three interceptions.</TE>

<LD>The eternally shifting BCS scenario -- who's in, who's out, who's
back in again -- obscures college football's most amazing turnaround
story.</LD>
<LD>   Hint: It's not Notre Dame.</LD>
<LD>   It's Iowa, a team that was 0-8 in the Big Ten only three seasons
ago.</LD>
<TE>   After a 62-10 romp over Northwestern Saturday, the 10-1 Hawkeyes
will go for a perfect 8-0 in the Big Ten next week against Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   "Being through what we've been through, the bond we have is
unbelievable," David Porter, a senior offensive tackle, told the
Cedar Rapids Gazette. "It was one of those things where it could kill
you or bring you together. Well, it almost killed us."</TE>
<TE>   Almost would be the key word.</TE>
<TE>   "At the beginning, we were all ready to quit, ready to stop. It
was about to kill us," senior guard Andy Lightfoot told the Gazette.
"But for some reason ... we stuck it out. It's definitely rewarding
us right now."</TE>
<TE>   Let others bemoan the fact the Big Ten schedule doesn't include a
game between No. 3 Ohio State and No. 6 Iowa to determine which team
really is the Big Ten's best. (Quite a few people believe it's Iowa,
especially after Ohio State's 10-6 Houdini act against Purdue
Saturday.)</TE>
<TE>   The Hawkeye players, whose only loss this season was a
nonconference game to Iowa State, focus on how far they've come in
four years under Coach Kirk Ferentz (rhymes with parents).</TE>
<TE>   One way or another, Iowa figures to play in a New Year's Day bowl
-- quite likely the Rose Bowl if undefeated Ohio State either slips
in its final two games or reaches the Fiesta Bowl to play for the
national title.</TE>
<TE>   If the teams tie for the Big Ten title, Ohio State would win the
tiebreaker because of its better overall record.</TE>
<TE>   If Ohio State plays in the Rose Bowl, Iowa probably would go to
the Citrus Bowl on Jan. 1 in Orlando.</TE>
<TE>   About the only Iowa player who gets any national air time is
quarterback Brad Banks, who is beginning to sneak onto some lists of
Heisman contenders.</TE>
<TE>   Banks entered the Northwestern game leading the nation in passing
efficiency rating at 159.3. And that rating will be going up after he
completed 10 of 10 passes for 197 yards and three touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   He also ran for another two touchdowns, accounting for five in the
game.</TE>
<TE>   Banks has thrown for 2,269 yards and completed 60.6% of his
passes, but his most impressive statistic is probably how error-free
he is.</TE>
<TE>   He has 23 touchdown passes and a mere four interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   The most famous quarterback in the state, Iowa State's Seneca
Wallace, is more spectacular but also more error prone, with 13
touchdown passes and 13 interceptions. Wallace was picked off three
times in Iowa State's latest big-game disaster, a 58-7 loss to Kansas
State Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Banks left the Iowa game against Northwestern midway through the
third quarter Saturday to a standing ovation at the Hawkeyes' Kinnick
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "It was almost ridiculous, the way they were cheering," said
Banks, who transferred to Iowa from a junior college two years ago.
"But there is still one game to go."</TE>
<TE>   Give Me an H</TE>
<TE>   Predicting the five players who will be in the room for the
Heisman Trophy presentation rarely has been so difficult so late in
the season.</TE>
<TE>   Miami's Ken Dorsey is on the rise again, and he's the most likely
winner in a nod to his career achievements, barring a Hurricane
slip-up down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   With Ohio State's Maurice Clarett fading because of injuries, it's
time for a look at the nation's leading rusher, Colorado's Chris
Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Brown probably shouldn't win, but he should be in the top five. He
ran for 211 yards in the Buffaloes' 42-35 overtime victory over
Missouri Saturday, his seventh consecutive 100-yard game.</TE>
<TE>   Brown has 1,617 yards this season.</TE>
<TE>   Should he care to pad his statistics, he should consult Colgate.</TE>
<TE>   Colgate quarterback Chris Brown ran for four touchdowns and 52
yards and passed for another 117 in a 28-14 victory over Lehigh
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Most Improved</TE>
<TE>   Pause, if you will, and recall the debut of Robert Hodge.</TE>
<TE>   He took over for injured Craig Ochs as Colorado's starting
quarterback Sept. 14 against USC and completed one of nine passes in
a 40-3 loss.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Hodge, a 5-foot-11, 185-pound senior from Manhattan
Beach Mira Costa High and El Camino College, passed for 203 yards and
ran for another 29 in Colorado's victory over Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   It's a victory that keeps Colorado, which started the season 1-2,
on track for the Big 12 title game, where it could play spoiler for
an Oklahoma or Texas team trying to reach the national championship
game.</TE>
<TE>   And He Doesn't Even Limp</TE>
<TE>   Michigan State's Charles Rogers set the school record with his
24th and 25th touchdown receptions in a 56-21 victory over Indiana in
interim coach Morris Watts' debut.</TE>
<TE>   Who owned the Michigan State career touchdown reception record?</TE>
<TE>   None other than Kirk Gibson, gimpy-legged Dodger hero of Game 1 of
the 1988 World Series.</TE>
<TE>   Letdown Warning</TE>
<TE>   A week after its undefeated season ended against Boston College,
Notre Dame barely escaped against Navy.</TE>
<TE>   A week after Virginia Tech's first loss, to Pittsburgh, the Hokies
lost to Syracuse in triple overtime.</TE>
<TE>   A week after its first loss, against Georgia Tech, North Carolina
State lost to Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   Does this mean Oklahoma should step carefully after its 30-26 loss
to Texas A&amp;M ended its run for an undefeated season?</TE>
<TE>   Next week's opponent: Baylor, a 41-0 loser to Texas Saturday in
its first game after the firing of Coach Kevin Steele.</TE>
<TE>   Rising in the East</TE>
<TE>   What's going on with the Big East?</TE>
<TE>   It's supposed to be the Big Easy -- Miami, maybe Virginia Tech,
and everybody else.</TE>
<TE>   But Rutgers, a team with one victory, gave Miami a run for its
money until the fourth quarter last week.</TE>
<TE>   Boston College beat Notre Dame and then lost to conference rival
West Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   And Pittsburgh and 4-6 Syracuse have beaten Virginia Tech.</TE>
<TE>   Miami has Pittsburgh, Syracuse and Virginia Tech standing between
it and a likely return to the national championship game.</TE>
<TE>   Good Point</TE>
<TE>   This logic courtesy of Fox Sports Net studio analyst Kellen
Winslow, father of Miami tight end Kellen Winslow Jr.</TE>
<TE>   If the Hurricanes had scored 28 points in the first quarter
instead of the fourth quarter of their 42-17 victory over Rutgers
last week, would anyone, least of all the poll-voters, have batted an
eye?</TE>

<TE>   Do You Believe in Miracles?</TE>
<TE>   Louisiana State does now, after it defeated Kentucky Saturday with
a desperation touchdown pass. A look at six "Hail Mary" passes in
college football since Boston College's Doug Flutie gained
immortality with one in 1984:</TE>
<TE>   Nov. 23, 1984: BOSTON COLLEGE 47, MIAMI 45</TE>
<TE>   Flutie beats Bernie Kosar and the Hurricanes in the Orange Bowl
with a 64-yard pass to Gerard Phelan. The play virtually secures the
Heisman Trophy for Flutie, and the Eagles complete a 10-2 season with
a 45-28 victory over Houston in the Cotton Bowl, Boston College's
first postseason victory in 44 years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nov. 14, 1987: IOWA 29, OHIO STATE 27</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Hartlieb completes a 28-yard pass to Marv Cook to give the
Hawkeyes their first victory at Ohio Stadium since 1959. "I think
I'll retire right now," says joyous Iowa Coach Hayden Fry, who
postpones retirement until the completion of the 1998 season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 24, 1994: COLORADO 27, MICHIGAN 26</TE>
<TE>   Kordell Stewart's last-gasp 64-yard pass is tipped by teammate
Blake Anderson into the arms of Michael Westbrook to stun the
Wolverines at Michigan Stadium. "What's that guy's name?" Stewart
asked. "Flutie? The guy who threw that one for Boston College? I saw
it on 'The 10 best Plays in College Football,' but who would ever
say, 'I'm going to go in there and do it myself some day.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 24, 1999: ARIZONA 30, WASHINGTON STATE 24</TE>
<TE>   The Wildcats' Keith Smith, throwing into a wind gusting to 50 mph,
completes a 42-yard pass to Bobby Wade at Martin Stadium. Replays
appeared to show the ball hitting the ground before Wade had
possession. "I can't comment too much under league rules," Cougar
Coach Mike Price said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oct. 28, 2000: NORTHWESTERN 41, MINNESOTA 35</TE>
<TE>   Zak Kustok's 45-yard pass is tipped by teammate Kunle Patrick and
grabbed by Sam Simmons for the game-winner. The play is appropriately
named "victory right." Said Kustok: "We practice that every week. Not
just like that, but pretty close."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nov. 9, 2002: LOUISIANA STATE 33, KENTUCKY 30</TE>
<TE>   LSU's Marcus Randall heaved the ball more than 60 yards on the
game's final play and three Kentucky players tipped it near the
Wildcat 30. But the ball wound up in the hands of LSU's Devery
Henderson, who avoided a diving tackle by Derrick Tatum and raced the
remaining 20 yards for a 75-yard touchdown play as Kentucky fans
flooded the other end of the field and pulled at the goal posts,
unaware of the dramatic change in the game's outcome.</TE>

<HD>Hamm Delivers for U.S.</HD>
<DH>Her overtime goal gives Americans a 2-1 victory over Canada
in final of CONCACAF Gold Cup. Mexico clinches third.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Out of the fog, off the bench and onto the victory podium.</LD>
<LD>   That was the path Mia Hamm took Saturday night as she led the U.S.
women's national team to a 2-1 victory over Canada in the
championship game of CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup in front of 6,911 at
the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   Sent on as a second-half substitute, Hamm scored the
tournament-winning goal 3:34 into sudden-death overtime.</LD>
<TE>   Taking an astute pass from Aly Wagner, Hamm fought off the
challenge of Canadian defender Breanna Boyd and lofted a shot over
goalkeeper Karina LeBanc, who had come off her line in response to
the threat.</TE>
<TE>   With the ball safely in the back of the net, Hamm took off on a
sprint for the corner flag, waving her arm to summon her teammates to
join the celebration. It was her first goal in the tournament and
could not have come at a better time.</TE>
<TE>   The match against a spirited and talented Canadian team was in
balance throughout, and the result could have gone either way.</TE>
<TE>   With the fog rapidly descending over the Arroyo Seco, making
visibility from the upper reaches of the Rose Bowl a problem, the
U.S. took the lead early, and in spectacular fashion.</TE>
<TE>   With just over 26 minutes played, Kristine Lilly blew past
Canadian defender Candace Chapman on the left flank.</TE>
<TE>   Lilly, in her world-record 244th international match, crossed the
ball into the goal area, where Tiffeny Milbrett hit it on the fly,
unleashing a ferocious left-foot volley from 12 yards that all but
tore the netting from the frame.</TE>
<TE>   It was one of the goals of the tournament and, until the dying
seconds of the first half, it seemed destined to be the game-winner.</TE>
<TE>   But Canada, not surprisingly, was not about to be knocked out by a
single punch.</TE>
<TE>   In the final minute of the half, Silvana Burtini sent a corner
kick in from the right, Andrea Neal headed the ball forward and
Christine Sinclair poked it toward the U.S. net, forcing goalkeeper
Briana Scurry into a foot block. Charmaine Hooper was on hand to
drive the ball home and tie the score.</TE>
<TE>   So much for Milbrett's heroics and the fog. Both disappeared at
halftime.</TE>
<TE>   In a pre-planned move, April Heinrichs, the U.S. coach, took
Milbrett and Tiffany Roberts off after 45 minutes, replacing them
with Hamm and Lorrie Fair, respectively, as she sought fresh legs to
drive the U.S. forward.</TE>
<TE>   And Hamm delivered.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, on a wet and thoroughly miserable evening in Pasadena,
Mexico also managed to find plenty to celebrate.</TE>
<TE>   Goals by Monica Gonzalez in the 13th minute, Iris Mora in the 37th
and two by Maribel Dominguez in the 66th and 82nd minutes were enough
to earn Coach Leonardo Cuellar's increasingly impressive team a
convincing 4-1 victory over Costa Rica and third place in the
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   More important, it kept alive Mexico's chances of joining the U.S.
and Canada in the Women's World Cup in China next year. Mexico
advances to play a home-and-home series against the third-place
finisher in the yet-to-be-played Asian qualifying tournament for a
place in the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "Being humble and not being arrogant, I think we are the better
team at this moment," Cuellar said, "so I think we deserved the
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, now we have another big challenge in front of us, but
we would like to put another CONCACAF team in the World Cup."</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's first goal came when American referee Kari Seitz ruled
that Costa Rican defender Gabriela Trujillo had fouled Dominguez when
the two chased a loose ball in the penalty area. Gonzalez made no
mistake with the resulting penalty kick, tucking the ball inside the
lower right corner of the net.</TE>
<TE>   In the 26th minute, Shirley Cruz stunned Mexico with a shot from
24 yards that flew into the net past diving Mexican goalkeeper
Jennifer Molina to tie the score.</TE>
<TE>   "I think my team was shaken strongly by such a beautiful goal,"
Cuellar said.</TE>
<TE>   It was the Ticas' last hurrah, however, because from then on
Mexico controlled the game on a muddy and in places water-logged
field.</TE>
<TE>   Mora put Mexico back in front within a minute of being sent on as
a substitute in the 36th minute, scoring directly off a corner kick
as the ball slipped past defender Cindy Rodriguez and beneath the
left arm of goalkeeper Marie Claire Herra.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's victory was assured in the second half by Dominguez's two
goals, the first on an excellent header off a cross from the right
flank by Mora, the second also from a Mora pass.</TE>

<HD>Heinze Not Recalled Despite Big Contract</HD>

<DL>MONTREAL</DL>
<LD>Three times this season the Kings have recalled a forward from the
minors and three times it has not been Steve Heinze.</LD>
<LD>   The latest was Michael Cammalleri, a 20-year-old rookie who made
his NHL debut in Friday night's 3-2 victory over the Ottawa Senators.</LD>
<LD>   Heinze, guaranteed $2 million this season as part of a three-year,
$6-million contract he signed as an unrestricted free agent in July
2001, remains with the Kings' American Hockey League team at
Manchester, N.H.</LD>
<TE>   "We just felt that we wanted a center and Cammalleri was the guy
that [Manchester Coach] Bruce Boudreau recommended," Coach Andy
Murray said. "We wanted somebody to give us a bit of an offensive
spark, so we asked for Cammalleri."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings could soon have another opportunity to promote Heinze.
Enforcer Ken Belanger will fly home to Los Angeles today for further
tests after suffering a concussion Tuesday night, possibly opening a
roster spot. But the Kings will wait for the results and an update on
Mikko Eloranta's availability before making a move.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Kings probably will continue to carry eight defensemen, Murray
said, adding that Brad Norton could move to forward to fill the
enforcer role if needed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Murray said it was not planned that defenseman Aaron Miller, in
his season debut after abdominal surgery, would play a game-high 24
minutes 37 seconds Friday night. "We just play the players that are
playing the best," the coach said.</TE>

<HD>Beating the Kings Is No Sweat</HD>
<DH>Canadiens don't have to work long to dispatch L.A., scoring
three times in first 12:08 for easy 3-1 victory. Potvin struggles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MONTREAL</DL>
<LD>This French-Canadian metropolis has always been a city of ruins for
the Kings, whose only trip to the Stanley Cup finals and just about
every regular-season visit to the city has been spoiled by the
Montreal Canadiens.</LD>
<LD>   Whether at the old Forum, where their title hopes went up in
flames in 1993, or at the Canadiens' new arena, renamed the Bell
Centre this year, the Kings have won only eight times in 64
regular-season games at Montreal.</LD>
<LD>   But even given their dismal history on the Canadiens' home ice, it
was startling to see the Kings wither so swiftly and decisively
Saturday night, when the Canadiens scored three goals in the first 12
1/2 minutes of a 3-1 victory.</LD>
<TE>   For the sellout crowd of 21,273, the suspense ended early.</TE>
<TE>   For the Kings, the glad tidings following Friday night's 3-2
victory over the Ottawa Senators were forgotten before the first
intermission.</TE>
<TE>   Then, during the intermission, Coach Andy Murray unloaded.</TE>
<TE>   His message?</TE>
<TE>   "That, unfortunately, some of you guys probably would prefer to be
someplace else right now," Murray said he told his players. "But
we're in Montreal, this is a National Hockey League game, there are a
lot of people across the country watching this game and we're in the
here and now and it's our responsibility to play a lot better than
we're playing.</TE>
<TE>   "And then I talked about some individual guys and what they needed
to do. We just didn't play with a National Hockey League level of
determination."</TE>
<TE>   The Canadiens were only too happy to take advantage.</TE>
<TE>   With King defenseman Lubomir Visnovsky in the penalty box for
holding Richard Zednik, former King center Yanic Perreault scored the
first of his two power-play goals on a shot from the left faceoff
circle at 4:31 of the first period.</TE>
<TE>   At 8:43, Zednik scored on a rebound from right in front of the
net.</TE>
<TE>   And then at 12:08, with King forward Adam Deadmarsh in the penalty
box for hooking Karl Dykhuis, Perreault scored from the right circle.</TE>
<TE>   All three goals were scored against goaltender Felix Potvin, who
started for the second night in a row. In his nearly two seasons with
the Kings, Potvin is 1-5-1 in the second game when starting games on
consecutive nights.</TE>
<TE>   Murray, though, said Potvin was only partially to blame.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be a reflection of how our team plays in front of him in
back-to-back games," the coach said of Potvin's poor record in starts
only 24 hours apart. "I didn't think our team played very well in
front of him tonight."</TE>
<TE>   The Canadiens' Jeff Hackett, meanwhile, took a shutout into the
final three minutes before Visnovsky scored with 2:14 to play.</TE>
<TE>   It was too little too late, of course, and no consolation to the
Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if we felt we were going to come in here and it was
going to be an easy night for us or what," defenseman Mathieu
Schneider said. "But I think after the first five minutes we realized
that it wasn't. By then, it was too late. We were on our heels. We
just weren't mentally prepared to play this game tonight."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, Schneider said, have yet to find a rhythm. They've lost
three of their last four games, four of six since Jason Allison was
sidelined because of a knee injury. Three games into an eight-game
trip, they're 1-2.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a matter of playing the same way every night and we haven't
been doing that," he said. "We need to do that, regardless of the
schedule, regardless of the score, regardless of how we feel. We need
that consistency."</TE>
<TE>   No more first periods like the one Saturday night would help.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no excuse for what happened," defenseman Mattias Norstrom
said. "No trip, nothing like that, is an excuse for us to start the
way we did."</TE>

<LD>Jerry Izenberg of the Newark Star-Ledger commenting wryly on a Don
King news conference: "Shy and introverted as Mr. King is, it is
difficult for a man to lose himself in the crowd when he is waving
not one but two hand-held American flags and is modestly dressed in a
denim jacket, studded with sequins and stars, decorated with red and
white vertical stripes along the sleeves, a drawing of the
presidential faces on the side of Mt. Rushmore with George W. Bush as
an added starter over a breast pocket, a shoulder blade to shoulder
blade multicolor map of the United States across its back, a white
shirt and a red, white and blue bow tie.</LD>
<LD>   "No, this last [item] didn't blink on and off, but nobody is
perfect."</LD>
<LD>   Trivia time: Which school holds the NCAA Division I-A record for
the longest football winning streak?</LD>
<TE>   A mother's wrath: Jackie Hurlbut of Provost, Canada, telling the
Calgary Sun about her streaker son Tim, 21, who slipped on the ice
and knocked himself unconscious at a Flame game:</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to be proud of my son, and I'm not right now. I worried
about him for just one moment before I was going to kill him."</TE>
<TE>   One thing missing: Bernie Miklasz in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch
commenting on Cardinal Manager Tony La Russa: "[He] is the NL's
manager of the year for 2002, and perhaps that will make him more
popular in St. Louis. I doubt it.</TE>
<TE>   "In St. Louis, 20 seasons have elapsed since the Cardinals won a
World Series. The fans hunger for that prize. La Russa wants it so
much that he burns inside. Hey, at least they have something in
common."</TE>
<TE>   Quick way to lose: Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle:</TE>
<TE>   "Nets guard Chris Childs, under suspension for being too fat, is
robbed of $30,000 in jewelry and cash outside a New York nightclub.
Send for Childs' new book, 'Lose 10 Pounds Instantly.' "</TE>
<TE>   More quick hits: From Michael Ventre's "Notes From the Field"
column on MSNBC.com:</TE>
<TE>   "* If I'm one of the top players in college football, I start
acting like a jerk and spreading nasty rumors about myself, because
if I don't, there's a darned good chance I could get drafted No. 1 by
the Cincinnati Bengals....</TE>
<TE>   "* I imagine the teams vying for the services of Dusty Baker are
busy upgrading their day-care facilities...."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1928, USC routed Arizona, 78-0, at
the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans had a 9-0-1 record that season, defeating Notre Dame,
27-14, in the final game at the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   Buyer's market: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported,
"Falcons' officials were concerned last month that when news got out
that they were considering changing uniforms for next season, the
sales of current jerseys would stop.</TE>
<TE>   "But quarterback Mike Vick's jersey was third-most popular in the
NFL."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Oklahoma, 47 wins, 1953-1957, ended by Notre Dame,
7-0.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Bud Geracie of the San Jose Mercury News quoting
Vick: "I have two weapons -- my legs, my arm and my brain."</TE>

<HD>As All Precincts Report in, Miami Can Do the Math</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KNOXVILLE, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>Riled-up Miami did a number on Tennessee at Neyland Stadium -- the
final tally was 26-3 -- then sat back to reflect while other
interesting figures rolled in on a frenetic football Saturday:</LD>
<LD>   Oklahoma, for instance, which last week knocked Miami out of the
top spot in the Associated Press poll for the first time in 21 weeks,
lost to unranked Texas A&amp;M at College Station.</LD>
<LD>   Ohio State, which jumped over Miami last week for the No. 2 spot
in the bowl championship series standings, needed a late touchdown to
defeat Purdue.</LD>
<TE>   In Knoxville, meanwhile, Miami rebounded from its amazing
victory-streak "slump" with a resounding 23-point victory against a
Tennessee team that had gone 65-3 in November games since 1985.</TE>
<TE>   The victory should push the 9-0 Hurricanes back to No. 1 in both
national polls and restore confidence to what had, strangely, become
a shaky commodity -- Miami football.</TE>
<TE>   While the BCS continues to spit out numbers, Miami continues to
spit out opponents. Saturday's victory before 107,745 was the 31st in
a row for the Hurricanes, tying the school for seventh place on the
all-time list of major college winning streaks.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, instead of considering its place in history, Miami has been
left to answer questions about recent come-from-behind wins against
West Virginia and Rutgers.</TE>
<TE>   Also, what's wrong with the run defense?</TE>
<TE>   "When you don't play well, the reporters start attacking you, and
sometimes it's even your teammates," Miami tight end Kellen Winslow
said. "We just needed to calm down and take care of business."</TE>
<TE>   In Miami's mind, order has been restored. A few Hurricanes were
admittedly miffed when the AP dropped them to No. 2 last week in the
aftermath of a 25-point road win.</TE>
<TE>   "To complain about a 42-17 win, that's beyond me," center Brett
Romberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Let the season play out, Coach Larry Coker kept telling his
players.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, there were eight unbeaten teams in Division I-A and
a dozen doomsday scenarios involving schools getting decimal-pointed
out of the national title game.</TE>
<TE>   With four undefeated teams losing last weekend and two more --
Oklahoma and Bowling Green -- falling Saturday, Miami and Ohio State
are the only two left standing.</TE>
<TE>   "Funny how things work out in college football," quarterback Ken
Dorsey said.</TE>
<TE>   When the fourth BCS standings are released Monday, Miami and Ohio
State will assuredly be the top two teams -- destined for a Fiesta
Bowl matchup provided both schools win out -- although the Buckeyes
might still hold a slight statistical BCS edge over the Hurricanes.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey said he hasn't concerned himself with under-the-hood BCS
details -- why, for instance, the New York Times' computer rankings
had two-loss USC ranked No. 3 and Miami No. 4.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't sit down for a week and figure that out," Dorsey said.
"I'm no math major. But we had a general understanding, along with
the rest of the nation, that the only time the BCS matters is the end
of the season."</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee, admittedly, was a wounded brigade. Twelve Volunteer
starters had missed a combined 37 starts and by the end of the game
quarterback Casey Clausen was on the bench with a head injury.</TE>
<TE>   Still, winning in Knoxville in November -- a rare parlay -- ought
to remove doubt as to whether Miami's crown has slipped.</TE>
<TE>   In hindsight, the Hurricanes have likely suffered only from
boredom the last few weeks, needing a reason to be challenged.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee provided the perfect backdrop, a national stage and
107,000-plus fans dressed, as usual, as roadside cones.</TE>
<TE>   It was never a game. Tennessee (5-4) had a chance to strike early
when, on the Volunteers' first possession, Cedric Houston broke
through the Miami defense and ran 74 yards to the Hurricane four.</TE>
<TE>   The Miami defense held, though, and Tennessee had to settle for a
field goal.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that made a huge statement," Coker said of the stand.</TE>
<TE>   The Hurricanes played the rest of the game downhill. The only
criticism was having to settle for field goals instead of touchdowns.
Todd Sievers made first-half kicks of 37, 39, 44 and 25 yards while
Willis McGahee capped an 80-yard second-quarter drive with a one-yard
touchdown run.</TE>
<TE>   Miami led, 19-3, at the half, and added a third-quarter touchdown,
an 11-yard pass from Dorsey to Winslow, to completely take the
Volunteers and their crowd out of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point they are as gifted a team as we have played,"
Tennessee Coach Phillip Fulmer said. "We've played a lot of good
teams in the past and have been one of those teams and that's where
we want to get back to."</TE>
<TE>   Miami could have spent the postgame spouting "I told you so," but
took the higher road. Oklahoma's loss, and Ohio State's struggle,
spoke volumes.</TE>
<TE>   Miami had concerns. Its rush defense ranked 77th nationally and it
knew Tennessee would test it.</TE>
<TE>   But after Houston's early 74-yard run, Miami held Tennessee to 67
yards in 37 carries.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know that it was really us against the world," Coker
said. "I think a lot of times it was us against us."</TE>
<TE>   The Miami offense was efficient, if not dominant.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey, who continues to make his case for the Heisman Trophy,
completed 18 of 35 passes for 245 yards and a touchdown while
McGahee, maybe Dorsey's most serious challenger, had 154 yards
rushing in 30 carries.</TE>
<TE>   All it took was another wild Saturday and three hours of football
here to put Miami back at No. 1 -- a position it thought it never
should have relinquished.</TE>
<TE>   Coker, who owns a 21-0 record since taking over for Butch Davis,
said he never doubted which team was the nation's best.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always felt that," Coker said. "I've felt that since August,
that if we win all our games we'll be in Tempe. The challenge is
winning all the games."</TE>
<TE>   If you're scoring at home for Miami, that's 31 straight wins, and
counting.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Moving On Up</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the bowl championship series were having a great time
until last week's games, when four unbeaten teams were upset victims.
And after No. 1 Oklahoma was knocked off Saturday by Texas A&amp;M, the
BCS title game was really falling into place.</TE>
<TE>   The controversial system should produce a non-controversial Fiesta
Bowl, a Jan. 3 matchup of the only two unbeaten teams, if 9-0 Miami
and 11-0 Ohio State win out.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Big Four</TE>
<TE>   A look at the leading contenders to get into the Fiesta Bowl in
Tempe, Ariz., on Jan. 3, and play for the national championship:</TE>
<TE>   MIAMI</TE>
<TE>   Record: 9-0.</TE>
<TE>   Ranking: No. 2 in AP; No. 3 in BCS.</TE>
<TE>   Remaining games: Nov. 21, Pittsburgh (8-2); Nov. 30, at Syracuse
(4-6); Dec. 7, Virginia Tech (8-2).</TE>
<TE>   Comment: Hurricanes will reclaim their rightful spot atop the AP
rankings today. As for the BCS, the New York Times computer will
probably rank C.W. Post ahead of them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   OHIO STATE</TE>
<TE>   Record: 11-0.</TE>
<TE>   Ranking: No. 3 in AP; No. 2 in BCS.</TE>
<TE>   Remaining games: Nov. 16, at Illinois (4-6); Nov. 23, Michigan
(8-2).</TE>
<TE>   Comment: Buckeyes are like the boxer who gets pummeled for 11
rounds, then lands a lucky punch for a KO in the 12th. They better
not wait till the midnight hour in two weeks against the Wolverines.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   OKLAHOMA</TE>
<TE>   Record: 8-1.</TE>
<TE>   Ranking: No. 1 in AP; No. 1 in BCS.</TE>
<TE>   Remaining games: Nov. 16, at Baylor (3-7); Nov. 23, Texas Tech
(7-4); Nov. 30, at Oklahoma State (4-5).</TE>
<TE>   Comment: A Boomer of a Sooner season didn't quite go bust Saturday
with the loss to Texas A&amp;M. If they circle the wagons and win out --
including the Big 12 championship game -- there could be an Oklahoma
Land Rush to Tempe.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TEXAS</TE>
<TE>   Record: 9-1.</TE>
<TE>   Ranking: No. 4 in AP; No. 4 in BCS.</TE>
<TE>   Remaining games: Nov. 16, at Texas Tech (7-4); Nov. 29, Texas A&amp;M
(6-4).</TE>
<TE>   Comment: The Longhorns may not make Big 12 championship game, but
could still do a two-step into the national title game. Remember,
that's the same end-around Nebraska ran last season for the right to
get Rose Bowled over by Miami.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Miami Dolphin receiver Cris Carter will be sidelined indefinitely
because tests revealed kidney-function abnormalities, the team said
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Carter, who came out of retirement three weeks ago, sat out
practice this week because he felt ill. He will undergo more tests.</LD>
<LD>   The Dolphins would not elaborate on his condition and declined to
say whether he had been hospitalized. Coach Dave Wannstedt would not
comment.</LD>
<TE>   Carter, an eight-time Pro Bowl selection, retired last spring
after 15 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   He struggled in his first game with Miami, a 24-10 loss at Green
Bay on Monday night. Carter lost a fumble after his first catch and
failed to catch a pass that was then intercepted. He finished with
three receptions for 31 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Carter, who turns 37 on Nov. 25, ranks second all-time to Jerry
Rice in receptions (1,096) and touchdown catches (129).</TE>
<TE>   Baseball</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds and Jason Giambi hit consecutive home runs in the
first and fifth innings, leading the major league All-Stars to an 8-1
exhibition victory over the Japan Series champion Yomiuri Giants at
Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   Rodrigo Lopez, the Baltimore Oriole starter who finished second in
American League rookie-of-the-year voting last week, held the Giants
to one hit in five innings.</TE>
<TE>   The All-Stars begin a seven-game series against Japan's best
players today.</TE>
<TE>   Ichiro Suzuki was not available against Yomiuri because of a
commitment in his hometown of Nagoya. He is in Japan to play for the
first time since leaving to sign with the Seattle Mariners two years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Japanese slugger Hideki Matsui, who last week said he intended to
play in the major leagues next season, said he is still unsure about
his baseball future.</TE>
<TE>   Matsui, 28, turned down a multiyear deal with Yomiuri in December.
Major league teams can begin negotiating with Matsui on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   College basketball</TE>
<TE>   USC junior forward Jerry Dupree, who was suspended for the first
six games of the season in an effort to help him concentrate on
off-the-court issues, has now been given a weeklong hiatus by Trojan
Coach Henry Bibby and will not rejoin the team until Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a suspension," Bibby said. "His health was down and he
hasn't gotten back to where I'd like him to be. Once he gets back he
can be a big asset to us. He just needed to get away from basketball
for a minute and get his life together."</TE>
<TE>   Dupree, who sat out the first two weeks of practice because of a
stomach infection, was the only Trojan missing from USC's 95-76
exhibition victory over the L.A. City All-Stars 2 in front of 357 at
the Lyon Center. Junior guard Desmon Farmer had 24 points, including
four three-pointers, eight rebounds and three assists, sophomore
guard Errick Craven had 22 points and four steals and junior college
transfer Roy Smiley had 17 points and six rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Louisiana Tech coach Leon Barmore and Texas Tech Coach
Marsha Sharp will be inducted into the Women's Basketball Hall of
Fame next spring.</TE>
<TE>   Former Maryland point guard Tara Heiss, Texas businessman Claude
Hutcherson and AAU All-Americans Patsy Neal and Doris Rogers also
will be inducted. An official announcement will be made today.</TE>
<TE>   Golf</TE>
<TE>   Bradley Dredge of Wales birdied the last two holes for a par 71 to
take a one-stroke lead after three rounds in the Volvo Masters at
Sotogrande, Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Dredge was at three-under 210, a shot ahead of Argentina's Angel
Cabrera (76) and Scotland's Colin Montgomerie (72).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Annika Sorenstam took a big step toward winning her 10th LPGA
title this year, shooting a seven-under 65 for a one-stroke lead in
the Mizuno Classic at Otsu, Japan.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea's Grace Park and Gloria Park were one stroke behind.
Each shot a 69.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fuzzy Zoeller shot a five-under-par 67 for a three-stroke lead
after one round in the Senior Slam at Superstition Mountain, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   Don Pooley and Stewart Ginn each shot a 70, and Jim Thorpe offset
five birdies with three bogeys and a double bogey for a 72. The
tournament ends today.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis</TE>
<TE>   Angelique Widjaja, 17, defeated top-seeded Tatiana Panova, 2-6,
6-1, 6-3, and Cho Yoon-jeong beat Lina Krasnoroutskaya, 6-4, 7-6 (3),
in the semifinals of the Volvo Women's Open at Pattaya, Thailand.</TE>
<TE>   Auto Racing</TE>
<TE>   Scott Wimmer won the Basha's Supermarket 200 under a yellow flag,
but Saturday was Greg Biffle's day.</TE>
<TE>   Biffle clinched the NASCAR Busch Series championship, leading all
but the last 16 laps of the 200-lap race at Phoenix International
Speedway. He finished third, just ahead of series runner-up Jason
Keller.</TE>
<TE>   Wimmer, a distant third in the standings, won for the third time
in the last seven races.</TE>
<TE>   Figure Skating</TE>
<TE>   Japan's Yoshie Onda nearly landed a triple axel in winning the
women's event in the Nations Cup at Gelsenkirchen, Germany, and
Olympic silver medalist Evgeny Plushenko put an artistic touch on his
new short program to take the lead.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese world champions Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo easily won the
pairs, and Bulgarian ice dancers Albena Denkova and Maxim Stayivski
earned their first major victory.</TE>
<TE>   Jurisprudence</TE>
<TE>   The University of South Florida must decide if it still has
grounds to fire a women's basketball coach accused of racial
discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   The 2nd District Court of Appeal ruled Friday that one of the two
reasons on which the university based the dismissal of Jerry Ann
Winters was invalid.</TE>
<TE>   The school fired Winters in December 2000, contending the coach,
who is white, dismissed black player Dione Smith from the team
shortly after Smith complained about racism. The school contended
Winters lied about her knowledge of the accusations in an affidavit.</TE>
<TE>   The court ruled Winters did not retaliate against the player, but
let stand the school's conclusion that she breached her contract by
lying in the affidavit.</TE>
<TE>   Smith is one of 12 players and a coach to sue, complaining of
racism at the school. The two sides have agreed to a settlement,
subject to a judge's approval.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rulon Gardner, the Olympic wrestling heavyweight champion who in
February lost a toe to frostbite, defeated Eddy Bengtsson, 3-0, in
the Kurt Angle Classic Greco-Roman event at New Orleans.</TE>

<LD>**** Makings of a classic</LD>
<LD>   *** Smash-mouth football</LD>
<LD>   ** Good for an end around</LD>
<TE>   * Strictly fantasy fodder</TE>
<TE>   * Cincinnati (1-7) at Baltimore (3-5), 10 a.m.: Raven quarterback
Jeff Blake says of his days in Cincinnati: "We didn't win a lot of
games, but I have a lot of good memories." At least he's half telling
the truth. LINE: Baltimore by 5 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   ** New Orleans (6-2) at Carolina (3-5), 10 a.m.: The Panthers'
touchdown drought has reached 11 quarters, but Rodney Peete is ready
to ride to the rescue after recovering from knee surgery. LINE: New
Orleans by 4 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   ** Detroit (3-5) at Green Bay (7-1), 10 a.m., Channel 11: The only
real suspense in this one is whether Packer defenders take out any
frustrations on former teammate Bill Schroeder, who didn't make many
friends in Green Bay. LINE: Green Bay by 10.</TE>
<TE>   ** New York Giants (4-4) at Minnesota (2-6), 10 a.m.: On debut of
offensive tackle Bryant McKinnie, Viking Coach Mike Tice says: "We'll
make sure he's in a position that enhances his rapid development as
opposed to hinders it." That Tice, always thinking. LINE: Pick.</TE>
<TE>   *** Indianapolis (4-4) at Philadelphia (6-2), 10 a.m., KNX (1070):
Last week the Colts held mobile quarterback Steve McNair to 82 yards
passing, 13 yards rushing ... and lost. As a reward, they get to try
the same defense on Donovan McNabb. LINE: Philadelphia by 9.</TE>
<TE>   *** Atlanta (5-3) at Pittsburgh (5-3), 10 a.m.: Atlanta Coach Dan
Reeves knows all about the potential of Tommy Maddox after drafting
him in Denver 10 years ago. His payback? He gets to watch Maddox pick
apart his defense. LINE: Pittsburgh by 5.</TE>
<TE>   *** San Diego (6-2) at St. Louis (3-5), 10 a.m., Channel 2: Two
games under .500 and Rams' Dre' Bly is feeling good: "Right now I'd
hate to be the team on the schedule ahead of us." Oddsmakers
certainly agree despite the disparity in records. LINE: St. Louis by
5 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   * Houston (2-6) at Tennessee (4-4), 10 a.m.: Los Angeles fans take
note: If the area ever gets an expansion franchise, this is what it
will be like for our team to go on the road for the first time to St.
Louis or Oakland. Feel the intensity. LINE: Tennessee by 10.</TE>
<TE>   ** Seattle (2-6) at Arizona (4-4), 1 p.m.: The compelling matchup
of the week will be banged-up Cardinal quarterback Jake Plummer (next
to last in the NFC in passing) against the Seahawk secondary (no
interceptions this season). LINE: Arizona by 3 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   ***Washington (4-4) at Jacksonville (3-5), 1 p.m., KLSX-FM (97.1),
XTRA (690): At the University of Florida, Steve Spurrier became
Jacksonville's favorite son. Now he returns and the week's biggest
question is, will there be more fans rooting for Spurrier or for the
Jaguars? LINE: Jacksonville by 3.</TE>
<TE>   ** New England (4-4) at Chicago (2-6), 1:15 p.m., KNX (1070):
David Terrell and Anthony Thomas, former Michigan Wolverines turned
Bears, rave about college teammate Tom Brady's leadership. Mike and
Carol couldn't be prouder. LINE: New England by 3 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   *** Kansas City (4-4) at San Francisco (6-2), 1:15 p.m., Channel
2: Sharpie plans to unveil advertising campaign this weekend inspired
by Terrell Owens' recent stunt. No word on whether Owens wants to be
a larger part of their "offense." LINE: San Francisco by 6 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   ** Miami (5-3) at New York Jets (3-5), 5:30 p.m., ESPN, KLSX-FM
(97.1): The last time the Dolphins played the Jets on the road on
national television, Miami let a 30-7 fourth-quarter lead get away in
an overtime loss. LINE: New York by 2.</TE>
<TE>   **** Oakland (4-4) at Denver (6-2), 6 p.m. Monday, Channel 7, KNX
(1070): Since Mike Shanahan was fired by Al Davis in 1989, the
Broncos are 12-2 against Oakland under the former Raider coach. Also,
no ceremonies planned to honor former Bronco linebacker Bill
Romanowski. LINE: Denver by 5.</TE>

<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The NFL season at halftime. Or: Time flies, even if you're a football
fan in Cincinnati....</LD>
<LD>   Most valuable player at the half: Brett Favre. Take him out of the
Green Bay lineup (as a sprained knee suffered against Washington
almost did). Take a look at what's left. That's a 7-1 team? That's a
Super Bowl team? It is if Favre stays in the lineup and the Packers
win the NFC home-field advantage. Favre is 6-0  in playoff games at
Lambeau  Field.</LD>
<LD>   Most valuable off-season acquisition: Drew Bledsoe. Where would
the Buffalo Bills be without him? Precisely where the Chicago Bears
and Cincinnati Bengals are without him. The opportunity: Both the
Bears and Bengals had their chances to trade for Bledsoe. The irony:
Both the Bears and Bengals decided to, ahem, pass.</LD>
<TE>   We know nothing: Pittsburgh and St. Louis, consensus Super Bowl
favorites, began the season a combined 1-8.</TE>
<TE>   But we are rallying: Led by the sure-handed quarterbacking of
Tommy Maddox and Marc Bulger (of course), Pittsburgh and St. Louis
are 7-0 over the last four weeks.</TE>
<TE>   If you don't really need the BCS, we'll take it: Who's No. 1 in
the NFL? Who knows? No power ranking can stick with a No. 1 team
longer than Steve Spurrier sticks with a quarterback. The consensus
has flip-flopped from St. Louis to New England to Oakland to Miami to
New Orleans to San Diego to Green Bay. With Denver, Philadelphia,
Tampa Bay and Pittsburgh on deck.</TE>
<TE>   And they want more wild cards: Twelve teams will qualify for the
NFL playoffs. Entering today's games, 11 teams have winning records.</TE>
<TE>   As your attorney, I advise you to retire immediately: Months
removed from the Pro Bowl, Pittsburgh quarterback Kordell Stewart was
benched and replaced by an ex-XFL player, Maddox.</TE>
<TE>   (Runner-up: Dallas quarterback Quincy Carter, who lost his job to
a minor-league pitcher who hadn't thrown a football in a competitive
game since 1997, Chad Hutchinson.)</TE>
<TE>   Best place to recruit offensive talent: The Arena League.
Following a trail blazed by Kurt Warner in 1999, Pittsburgh's Maddox,
another Arena alum, is 4-1 since becoming the Steelers' starting
quarterback. And Maddox's former New Jersey Red Dog teammate, Michael
Lewis, had 356 all-purpose yards while  returning a punt and a
kickoff for touchdowns for New Orleans in  Week 6.</TE>
<TE>   Worst use of slow motion: Emmitt Smith's bearcrawl to history --
the final, plodding steps the old Cowboy needed to pass Walter Payton
on the all-time rushing list. In his 13th season, Smith, 32, is
averaging 66 yards a game. Try to remember  the Super Bowl years, if
you  can.</TE>
<TE>   Doomsday Offense: Worst game of 2002: Arizona 9, Dallas 6 (in
overtime!). Second-worst game of 2002: Detroit 9, Dallas 7. Worst
game of 2001: Dallas 9, Washington 7. What do these games have in
common? And what will Dave Campo be doing this time next year?</TE>
<TE>   Smartest rookie: Bryant McKinnie, who held out for half of the
Minnesota Vikings' season.</TE>
<TE>   Dumbest rookie: McKinnie, who, despite knowing what he now knows,
signed with the Vikings last week.</TE>
<TE>   Biggest brain cramp (player): Cleveland Linebacker Dwayne Rudd,
for the Helmet Toss Heard 'Round the World, which cost the Browns a
season-opening victory over Kansas City and, most likely, a trip to
the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Biggest brain cramp (team): The Denver Bronco field-goal unit, for
walking off the field after Jason Elam's long field-goal sailed wide,
enabling Baltimore's Chris McAllister to catch the ball and return it
107 yards for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Biggest brain cramp (coach): It took one Super Bowl defeat, an 0-5
start and injuries to his top two quarterbacks for St. Louis' Mike
Martz to figure out that giving the ball to Marshall Faulk is a game
plan with an upside.</TE>
<TE>   Fade patterns: The Oakland Raiders started 4-0, followed by 0-4.
The Carolina Panthers started 3-0, followed by 0-5. The Cincinnati
Bengals started 0-7, followed by  1-0.</TE>
<TE>   Worst uniform change: Seattle's all-khaki look. If Mike Holmgren
was really so smart, he'd have held out for the camouflage.</TE>
<TE>   (Runner-up: Cleveland's one-game experiment with the Great Pumpkin
look. Orange football jerseys in Cleveland? What next, John Elway
inducted into the Browns' Hall of Fame?)</TE>
<TE>   Why no inquisition? Seattle cornerback Shawn Springs has the same
financial advisor as Terrell Owens. Springs was allegedly covering
Owens on his infamous mightier-than-the-sword pass route-and-pen
stroke maneuver. Springs then watched Owens hand over the signed
football to the financial advisor he and Owens share. All of this on
"Monday Night Football." Hmmm. So what did Springs know? And when did
he know it?</TE>
<TE>   Money well spent: Redskin owner Daniel Snyder decided to fire last
season's coach, Marty Schottenheimer, and pay Spurrier $25 million to
replace him. Schottenheimer is 6-2 with the San Diego Chargers, who
were 6-26 in 2000-01.</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier had to beat the grounded Indianapolis Colts and the
hapless Seahawks just to even his record at</TE>
<TE>   4-4.</TE>
<TE>   "The Best Crop of QBs in 20 Years": That's what Sports Illustrated
says on the cover of its latest issue. Settle down, boys and girls.
For every Michael Vick and Drew Brees out there, there are NFL teams
giving starting assignments to Randy Fasani, Matt Hasselbeck, Shane
Matthews, Danny Wuerffel, Akili Smith, Gus Frerotte, Quincy Carter,
Chad Hutchinson, Jamie Martin and Ray Lucas.</TE>
<TE>   Should have been a sportswriter: Dozens of journalists were on
hand to watch Lucas' 13-for-33, four-interception, two-fumble
performance in Miami's 23-10 home loss to Buffalo, but no one summed
it up more succinctly and accurately than Lucas: "I don't think
there's ever been a case where one guy lost a game for his team.
Except today. I was terrible.... [That was] the  worst game anyone
has ever  played."</TE>
<TE>   Realignment re-examined: Hottest discussion topic at the midway
point: How some 10-6 or 11-5 division runner-up is certain to get
jobbed out of a playoff spot by a 7-9 or 8-8 division winner because
of the new realignment. While it's been fun to hear the teeth gnash,
the fear isn't quite justified by the threat.</TE>
<TE>   A comparison of the old and  new alignments and which teams would
qualify if the playoffs began  today:</TE>
<TE>   Old AFC: Division leaders Denver (6-2), Miami (5-3) and Pittsburgh
(5-3) and wild cards San Diego (6-2), Buffalo (5-4) and Tennessee
(4-4, by virtue of tiebreakers).</TE>
<TE>   New AFC: Division leaders Denver, Miami, Pittsburgh and Tennessee
and wild cards San Diego and Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   Old NFC: Division leaders Green Bay (7-1), Philadelphia (6-2) and
San Francisco (6-2) and wild cards Tampa Bay (7-2), New Orleans (6-2)
and Atlanta (5-3).</TE>
<TE>   New NFC: Division leaders Green Bay, Philadelphia, San Francisco
and Tampa Bay and wild cards New Orleans and Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, the same 12 teams qualify.</TE>
<TE>   So, pace yourselves, everybody. No nervous breakdown required yet.</TE>
<TE>   This season still has a long way to go.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Washington goalie Olaf Kolzig is showing few ill effects from the
wrist injury that recently sidelined him.</LD>
<LD>   Kolzig made 43 saves, and Sergei Gonchar sparked a four-goal
second period with his first goal this season, and the Capitals
defeated the Philadelphia Flyers, 4-1, Saturday night at Washington.</LD>
<LD>   Kolzig has given up only two goals in consecutive victories after
returning from a left wrist injury that sidelined him for four games.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought I did a good job of staying in the game and our guys
did a good job of not letting up," Kolzig said. "It was a big
character builder for this team."</TE>
<TE>   The Capitals chased goalie Roman Cechmanek with three goals in the
first seven minutes of the second period.</TE>
<TE>   The Capitals have won three in a row and ended a six-game losing
streak to Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 4, San Jose 2 -- Pierre-Marc Bouchard and Wes Walz
scored third-period goals at San Jose, and the surprising Wild stayed
atop the Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Marian Gaborik scored his league-leading 11th goal for Minnesota.</TE>

<HD>Holiday Wakes Up Irish to Avert Upset by Navy</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>Trailing by eight points against lightly regarded Navy late in the
game, ninth-ranked Notre Dame rallied behind sophomore quarterback
Carlyle Holiday to avert a second consecutive upset.</LD>
<LD>   Holiday set up the tying score with a 29-yard completion to Omar
Jenkins, then passed to a wide-open Jenkins for a 67-yard touchdown
with 2 minutes 8 seconds remaining to give Notre Dame a 30-23 victory
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   One week after losing at home to Boston College, 14-7, the Irish
(9-1) maintained their slim national title hopes going by beating the
Midshipmen (1-8) for the 39th consecutive game.</LD>
<TE>   "We didn't wake up until about four minutes were left in the
game," said Irish Coach Tyrone Willingham, who tied Terry Brennan
(1954) and Ara Parseghian ('64) for most wins by a first-year Notre
Dame coach.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish, who lost three fumbles against Boston College, lost
three more against the Midshipmen and fell behind, 23-15, in the
fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   That's when Holiday took over.</TE>
<TE>   Holiday's completion to Jenkins led to a one-yard touchdown run by
Rashon Powers-Neal.</TE>
<TE>   Holiday passed to Arnaz Battle for the two-point conversion that
tied the score, 23-23, with 4:28 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   After Notre Dame got the ball back at its 33 with 2:19 left,
Jenkins slipped behind the Navy secondary and hauled in a long pass
from Holiday.</TE>
<TE>   Navy came in as a 28-point underdog and played most of the game
without quarterback Craig Candeto, who sprained his ankle on the
game's fourth play. Aaron Polanco performed capably in his place,
scoring two touchdowns, but he also had two passes intercepted.</TE>

<DH>Crackdown on illegal hits has players on collision course
with the NFL office</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lance Pugmire</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The game is built on the premise that a good player becomes less
good when he's hit so hard he doesn't want to be hit again."</LD>
<LD>   -- George Halas, an NFL founder and longtime Chicago Bear coach,
in an NFL Films interview</LD>
<LD>   "You made no effort to tackle the player or break up the pass and
instead engaged in what appears to be simply a gratuitous effort to
punish your opponent after the pass to him has been deflected by your
teammate."</LD>
<TE>   -- NFL Director of Operations Gene Washington's memo informing San
Diego Charger safety Rodney Harrison of his one-game suspension</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When the Chargers visited Oakland last year, Raider receiver Jerry
Rice finished with eight catches for 131 yards and three touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   In the first quarter of this year's game on Oct. 20, Rice was in
position to score again.</TE>
<TE>   Rodney Harrison, the Chargers' hard-hitting safety, ensured it
wouldn't happen. Thrusting himself toward Rice as Charger rookie
Quentin Jammer converged, Harrison delivered a jarring hit right
after Jammer's deflection.</TE>
<TE>   Rice needed assistance to get up.</TE>
<TE>   The collision had the obvious feel of a momentum change -- in the
game and, perhaps, in the season.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of taking a 7-0 lead, the Raiders failed to score. The
Chargers kept Rice from repeating his dominant effort of 2001 and
grabbed first place in the AFC West with a 27-21 overtime victory.
The Raiders have lost two more games since.</TE>
<TE>   "No question," Harrison said. "That changed the momentum."</TE>
<TE>   A defining play. And, in the NFL's opinion, a flagrant
rule-violating play.</TE>
<TE>   Gene Washington, the league's disciplinarian, suspended Harrison
for one game for the helmet-to-helmet hit that didn't draw a flag. In
assessing the penalty, which cost Harrison $111,764 in salary,
Washington said Harrison had repeatedly violated rules crafted by the
NFL competition committee in 1995 to stop players from hitting
opponents who are in a defenseless posture.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't hit receivers who are trying to catch the ball in
anything but a defenseless position," Harrison argued this week after
practicing for today's confrontations with the St. Louis Rams'
receiving tandem of Isaac Bruce and Torry Holt. "If a guy has his
arms extended and his eyes on the ball, he's defenseless."</TE>
<TE>   Washington also suspended Denver defensive back Kenoy Kennedy for
one game after his devastating hit left Miami receiver Chris Chambers
with a concussion.</TE>
<TE>   Among the 19 fines Washington has levied for improper hits this
season were a $75,000 bill to Dallas safety Darren Woodson, whose
crushing hit on Seattle's Darrell Jackson caused the second-year
receiver to suffer seizures and require an overnight hospital stay,
and a $50,000 assessment to Philadelphia safety Brian Dawkins, who
delivered a season-ending hit to New York Giant receiver Ike
Hilliard.</TE>
<TE>   "[The fines] are deterrents," Washington said. "We have very few
repeat offenders, with the exceptions of Rodney and Kennedy. The
point is, we are charged to make the game as safe as it can be while
recognizing it's a dangerous game.</TE>
<TE>   "There's two sides to this. Jackson is probably out for the
season. Hilliard is out, in the last year of his contract. What do we
say to the player who might get paralyzed, 'We're sorry we were so
lax on this'? Someone has to accept responsibility. That's what we
do. The people who are competing need guidelines and those guidelines
have to be enforced."</TE>
<TE>   The league's hard line on hard hits has generated the most heated
debate of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Curtis Conway, a Charger receiver, said, "It's a big judgmental
thing now. You see those guys [Dawkins and Hilliard] get hit and say,
'Dang, he didn't have to get hit that hard.' But it's football. I've
been in the league 10 years. I know the defensive guys have to do
things to discourage us from catching balls, just like we have to run
by them to discourage them from playing bump-and-run on us."</TE>
<TE>   Jack Tatum, the former Oakland defensive back whose hit resulted
in the paralysis of former New England receiver Darryl Stingley in
1978, lamented, "It's turning into a push-and-shove league."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue issued memos to all 32 head
coaches, instructing them to reinforce to players the rules regarding
helmet-to-helmet hits and other "dangerous or violent tactics ...
that involve high potential for serious injury to opponents."</TE>
<TE>   Sam Wyche, a head coach in the league for 12 years who led the
1988 Cincinnati Bengals to the Super Bowl, said the league's tough
stance is "litigation motivated," adding that coaches have no other
option than to oblige the commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   By monitoring the collisions so vigorously, the NFL has raised
questions about a possible hidden agenda. Are officials frightened
about an on-field death, and the obvious legal and public relations
repercussions? Is the league singling out those with hard-hitting
reputations? Is it an attempt to increase scoring?</TE>
<TE>   "This is strictly a matter of reacting to what's happening on the
field," league spokesman Greg Aiello said.</TE>
<TE>   In its revised 1995 safety policies, the competition committee
stated it was responding to "the increasing size and speed of
players, evolutionary changes in equipment and players' on-field
tactics."</TE>
<TE>   "Vince Lombardi used to say football was a game of blocking and
tackling," said Steve Sabol, president of NFL Films. "It's now a game
of collisions."</TE>
<TE>   Aiello said the injuries to Jackson, Hilliard and Chambers have
"underscored the importance of the rules."</TE>
<TE>   Enjoying unprecedented success -- the average NFL game draws 14.1
million television viewers, and a $17.6-billion television deal runs
through 2005 -- the league has become the most successful sports
institution in history.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you imagine what would happen if someone was killed on the
field?" said Pierce Scranton, former longtime doctor for the Seattle
Seahawks. "It's exactly what the league doesn't need."</TE>
<TE>   The 2001 training camp death of Minnesota Viking offensive lineman
Korey Stringer, and the $100-million wrongful death suit filed by his
family, have been staggering reminders of liability issues.</TE>
<TE>   "The league is saying there is likely one lawyer too many that
would come after us if it's believed we haven't adequately protected
our players," Wyche said.</TE>
<TE>   Wyche said that by assessing harsh fines and issuing suspensions
for gray-area hits, the league has strayed where it shouldn't have.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people say I'm ruining the game," Washington said. "We have
a dynamic sport. If players were playing under the same guidelines of
20 years ago, we'd have serious injuries. So we make our rules
dynamic too."</TE>
<TE>   Charlie Waters, a former Dallas defensive back who played in five
Super Bowls, argued that the penalties are intended to increase
scoring.</TE>
<TE>   "The defensive foundation is being chipped away, and we're going
to lose the integrity of the game," Waters said. "The game is about
contact. To me, Darren Woodson did his job. By asking him to slack
up, you're telling him to take the chance of not doing his job, which
means he'll get beat.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to make changes, get the receivers better helmets, or
tell the quarterback not to throw the ball high over the middle, or
get more physical receivers. Our job as defenders is to knock the
ball loose."</TE>
<TE>   Harrison, a two-time Pro Bowl player, said he's confused about how
to modify his intimidating style in light of the discipline.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, I don't want to be suspended again; I don't want to
hurt my team," Harrison said. "I have to play according to their
rules. I'm going [to hit] low now. What else can I do?"</TE>
<TE>   One issue that irks some players is their opinion that the NFL
profits from big hits. A teammate pointed out to Harrison that CBS
promoted a Charger game with the highlight of Harrison smashing into
Rice.</TE>
<TE>   Sabol of NFL Films said no improper hits were shown in the
company's 1985 video, "Crunch Course," or "Hard Hits," in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Brown, a spokesman for EA Sports, maker of the popular,
NFL-licensed Madden video games, said hard hitting and taunting by
defensive backs over fallen receivers had been incorporated into
"Madden 2002." The Madden games have generated $1 billion in revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "Every single inch of the code for the game is reviewed and
approved by the NFL," Brown said. "We would never do something that
took license with the game, and at no point did the NFL say, 'You
can't do this,' or, 'Take this out of the game.' Our saying is, 'If
it's in the game, it's in the game.' Our game is very reflective of
what you see in the stadiums."</TE>

<HD>Buckeyes Roll the Dice, Come Up Winners</HD>
<DH>Krenzel's 37-yard scoring pass on fourth down with 1:36
remaining propels Ohio State to 10-6 victory over Purdue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind.</DL>
<LD>Ohio State was trailing on the road and facing fourth down late in
the game, with not only a victory but the Big Ten title and a chance
at the Fiesta Bowl berth slipping away.</LD>
<LD>   Craig Krenzel found a way to keep it all within reach for the
Buckeyes.</LD>
<LD>   He threw a 37-yard touchdown pass to Michael Jenkins on a
fourth-and-one play with 1:36 left as the third-ranked Buckeyes
defeated Purdue, 10-6, Saturday to keep their national championship
hopes alive.</LD>
<TE>   The Buckeyes (6-0 Big Ten) are off to their fourth 11-0 start in
team history, joining the 1975, 1979 and 1995 teams. More
importantly, they probably will remain No. 2 in the bowl championship
series standings, keeping them in contention for the national title.</TE>
<TE>   The Boilermakers (4-6, 2-4) were leading, 6-3, when Krenzel
dropped back and found Jenkins -- who sprinted down the sideline
before cutting in -- for an over-the-shoulder catch in the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a situation I wish everybody in the world could feel, with
that kind of excitement, that natural high," Krenzel said.</TE>
<TE>   Krenzel completed 13 of 20 passes for 173 yards. He had been
pressured throughout by a bruising Purdue defense that held Ohio
State to 267 yards and sacked Krenzel three times.</TE>
<TE>   But Krenzel, using a no-huddle offense, called the game-winning
play at the line of scrimmage, and Jenkins beat Antwaun Rogers to get
open.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what a receiver has to do. We have to separate when the
ball is coming," Jenkins said.</TE>
<TE>   Purdue got the ball again, but Kyle Orton's pass into double
coverage was intercepted by Chris Gamble.</TE>
<TE>   The Boilermakers need victories in their final two games to become
bowl-eligible for the sixth consecutive season. They've lost eight
games in a row against ranked teams.</TE>
<TE>   "This may or may not be hard to believe, but the game played out
exactly as we hoped," Purdue Coach Joe Tiller said.</TE>
<TE>   "We just wanted to be in position to win the game in the fourth
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "We just didn't get the key stop on a fourth-down play and didn't
operate the two-minute offense."</TE>
<TE>   Strong performances by both defenses ensured a low-scoring game.</TE>
<TE>   The Buckeyes barely had enough time to kick a field goal as time
ran out in the first half to make it 3-3.</TE>
<TE>   Krenzel escaped pressure and scrambled 15 yards down the middle to
Purdue's 13. On a third-and-nine play from the 12, Krenzel ran again,
this time for seven yards but short of the first down.</TE>
<TE>   With no timeouts left and the clock ticking down, the field-goal
unit hurried onto the field, and the center snapped the ball just in
time for Mike Nugent to kick a 22-yarder. Tiller argued to officials
that time had expired, but replays indicated that there was one
second showing when the ball was snapped.</TE>
<TE>   Nugent has made 22 field goals in a row dating to last season and
is closing in on the NCAA Division I-A career record of 30 in a row,
set by Washington's Chuck Nelson.</TE>
<TE>   Nugent has made 21 in a row this season and is within reach of the
single-season record of 25, which Nelson set in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   Buckeye running back Maurice Clarett, who had nerve damage in his
left shoulder that kept him out of the last two games, started and
ran 14 times for 52 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State played without wide receiver Chris Vance, who was
attending his brother's funeral.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kyle Boller matched his career high with five touchdown passes to
lead California past No. 25 Arizona State, 55-38, Saturday night at
Tempe, Ariz.</LD>
<LD>   Arizona State lost despite 477 yards passing from Andrew Walter.</LD>
<LD>   Joe Igber rushed for a season-high 144 yards and caught a 17-yard
touchdown pass for the Bears, 6-4 overall and 3-3 in the Pacific 10
Conference, in a wildgame that featured six lead changes.</LD>
<TE>   The Sun Devils (7-4, 4-2) were doomed by three fumbles deep in
their own territory, an interception returned 85 yards for a Cal
touchdown, and a blocked punt that was returned for a score.</TE>
<TE>   California scored the game's last 20 points after Arizona State
took a 38-35 lead on Hakim Hill's two-yard touchdown run with 2:36
left in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Walter completed 29 of 50 passes, including four touchdowns, and
broke Arizona State's single-season record for passing yards even
though he didn't start until the fifth game.</TE>
<TE>   With two games to play, Walter has 2,994 yards, breaking the
record of 2,878 set by Danny White in 1973. His 25 touchdown passes
are No. 2 on the ASU single-season list.</TE>
<TE>   Boller completed 16 of 35 passes for 213 yards and was intercepted
once.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 41, Oregon State 29 -- Cody Pickett threw for 262 yards
to become the Huskies' career passing leader, and Derrick Johnson had
two of Washington's five interceptions in a victory at Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Rich Alexis had two one-yard touchdown runs, John Anderson kicked
field goals of 23 and 52 yards and Washington (5-5, 2-4) avoided the
school's first four-game losing streak since 1974.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson returned one interception 42 yards for a touchdown, and
Chris Massey took another 25 yards into the end zone. The Beavers
(6-4, 2-4) hurt themselves with mistakes and sustained a setback in
their bid for a bowl game.</TE>
<TE>   It was a historic day for Pickett, who came in 87 yards away from
becoming Washington's career passing leader.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the second quarter, a 14-yard pass to Alexis moved him
past Brock Huard (5,742 yards) on the list.</TE>

<HD>Desperation Turns Into Celebration for LSU</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Louisiana State practices desperation pass plays every Thursday, but
quarterback Marcus Randall said they never work.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, LSU made one of them work when it absolutely needed
it.</LD>
<LD>   Devery Henderson caught a deflected 75-yard touchdown pass from
Randall as time expired to lift the No. 16 Tigers to a stunning 33-30
victory over Kentucky at Lexington, Ky.</LD>
<TE>   "We always say we need to play for 60 minutes," LSU Coach Nick
Saban said. "There is the reason why."</TE>
<TE>   LSU (7-2, 4-1 in the conference) appeared headed for a second
consecutive conference loss after Taylor Begley's 29-yard field goal
with 11 seconds left put Kentucky (6-4, 2-4) ahead, 30-27.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of blue-clad fans crowded the sidelines and were poised
to charge onto the field as the Tigers got the ball back at their
13-yard line. Before the final play, the Wildcats doused Coach Guy
Morriss with a cooler of Gatorade.</TE>
<TE>   Randall passed to Michael Clayton at the 25, and LSU called a
timeout with two seconds left. Saban gave Randall simple instructions
on the sideline.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach Saban just told me to throw it as far as I could," said
Randall, a sophomore making only the third start of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Randall took the snap, avoided the rush to his right and heaved
the ball more than 60 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never thrown a ball that far," Randall said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Kentucky cornerback Leonard Burress: "He doesn't have that
strong an arm and then he throws it from his 20 to our 30."</TE>
<TE>   Burress was one of eight Wildcats who had a chance to make a play
on the ball.</TE>
<TE>   As the ball sailed through the air, fireworks exploded out of the
Kentucky scoreboard and Wildcat fans attacked the goal post at the
east end zone.</TE>
<TE>   At the other end of the field, Kentucky linebacker Morris Lane and
two other Wildcats tipped the ball, and Henderson caught it inside
the 20.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know who it was, but I thought we had a chance to
intercept it," Morriss said. "I don't know just how it happened, but
we had our hands on the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Cornerback Derrick Tatum missed a diving tackle, and Henderson
reached the end zone as Kentucky fans continued to pull on the goal
post at the other end, oblivious to the incredible ending.</TE>
<TE>   "I caught it, and then I slowed down," Henderson said. "I said,
'Lord, just let me get to the end zone with it.' I just kept
running."</TE>
<TE>   The jubilant Tigers raced to mob Henderson, who had five
receptions for 201 yards and three touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the biggest play of my life," Randall said.</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky fans slowly realized what had just happened. Many sat at
midfield as a small group of LSU fans celebrated.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw it all happen. I can't believe it," said Kentucky junior
kick returner Derek Abney. "From one emotion to another, it's utter
confusion."</TE>
<TE>   The bitter defeat was Kentucky's 13th in a row against a ranked
conference opponent.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always hard when you come back in a game like this and
something crazy like that happens to you," Saban said of Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 7 Georgia 31, Mississippi 17 -- Terrence Edwards caught a
33-yard touchdown pass and David Greene completed 12 of 22 passes for
206 yards as the Bulldogs won at Athens, Ga., to move within one
victory of clinching a spot in the SEC championship game. Georgia
(9-1, 6-1) hasn't won an SEC title since 1982.</TE>
<TE>   Eli Manning completed only 12 of 25 passes for 176 yards and two
interceptions for Ole Miss (5-5, 2-4).</TE>
<TE>   He has had eight passes intercepted in the last four games after
getting only three passes picked off in the first six games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 11 Alabama 28, Mississippi State 14 -- Tyler Watts completed
16 of 22 passes for 223 yards and three touchdowns, but it was the
defense that bailed out the Crimson Tide at Tuscaloosa, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   Watts hooked up with Triandos Luke for two touchdowns, including a
36-yard scoring play on fourth and 11 late in the third quarter to
give Alabama (8-2, 5-1) its final touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's No. 2 defense took over from there and gave up only
70 yards and five first downs after halftime. Mississippi State is
3-6, 0-5.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 23 Florida 21, Vanderbilt 17 -- Earnest Graham ran for 125
yards and a touchdown to help the Gators (7-3, 5-2) win at Nashville,
Tenn. The Commodores (2-8, 0-6) have lost 12 in succession to Florida
but held the Gators scoreless in the second half and had the ball
with 5:41 left. But Vanderbilt couldn't move past its 34 and was
stunted by illegal-substitution and holding calls.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas 23, South Carolina 0 -- Matt Jones threw two touchdown
passes and Arkansas (6-3, 3-3) posted consecutive shutouts for the
first time since 1974 to win at Columbia, S.C. South Carolina (5-5,
3-4) has lost three straight after starting 5-2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Auburn 52, Louisiana Monroe 14 -- Jason Campbell completed eight
of 10 passes for 184 yards and two touchdowns to help the Tigers
(7-3) win at Auburn, Ala. Louisiana Monroe is 2-8.</TE>

<HD>Serena Has a Score to Settle in Victory</HD>
<DH>After briefly losing track of points, Williams rolls past
Dokic and will face Capriati in semifinals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Dillman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A player hits a 111-mph ace in a tiebreaker and the natural tendency
is to keep moving forward.</LD>
<LD>   But Serena Williams took it one step beyond. Well, make that a few
steps. She started to change sides, got close to the net and noticed
her opponent, Jelena Dokic of Yugoslavia, was not moving or getting
ready to serve. The realization that it was only 3-0 in the
tiebreaker hit her and Williams started laughing.</LD>
<LD>   That was essentially her last misstep in Saturday's quarterfinals
at the Home Depot WTA Championships.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know what I was thinking, I was just gone," said
Williams, who broke out her black "catsuit" for the occasion.</TE>
<TE>   Gone, but not for long. The top-seeded defending champion dropped
one point in the tiebreaker and swept the second set, defeating No. 8
Dokic, 7-6 (1), 6-0, in an hour at Staples Center before an announced
6,559. Today's semifinals will feature No. 2 Venus Williams against
No. 5 Kim Clijsters of Belgium, followed by Serena against No. 3
Jennifer Capriati.</TE>
<TE>   Capriati had to go three sets against Magdalena Maleeva of
Bulgaria before winning their quarterfinal, 6-2, 4-6, 6-1, in 1 hour
33 minutes. The announced crowd for their afternoon match was 4,788
but appeared to be closer to the 2,500-3,000 range.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 12 singles matches in this tournament, only two have gone
three sets.</TE>
<TE>   There almost was no singles match at night. The appearance of
Dokic was far from certain because of an injured right ankle, which
she suffered in practice during the week before the season-ending
tournament. Whether she would play or not was in doubt a couple of
hours before the match, and organizers were working on a backup plan;
for example, an exhibition between Williams and alternate Alexandra
Stevenson.</TE>
<TE>   Dokic tested the ankle, then went ahead and played. She knew she
could not sustain long rallies against Williams, so Dokic went for
the quick winner. The tactic paid off early as Dokic led, 4-1, before
Williams quit spraying the ball long and wide. Dokic came within two
points of winning the first set, at 30-30 on Williams' serve in the
12th game. But Williams won the next two points to send it to a
tiebreaker.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a little bit hard to move and I wasn't even sure I was
going to play," said Dokic, who reported that she had stretched
ligaments in her ankle. "I was hurting a little bit more in the
second set. If I was limping, I wouldn't be on the court.</TE>
<TE>   "I was good enough to play a set or two, but against Serena you
have to be 100%, which I wasn't."</TE>
<TE>   Williams raised her level when it was necessary but wasn't
thrilled with her own effort, saying, "I was just making too many
errors. I wasn't attacking my shots and [was] letting her dictate
play. I didn't play exceptionally well."</TE>
<TE>   She is 6-4 against Capriati but has won their last five matches,
four of them this year.</TE>
<TE>   "I never feel like an underdog against Serena," Capriati said.
"It's just we always have really tough matches, close matches and it
just seems like who's really on that day or who's just playing well
that day."</TE>
<TE>   Maleeva attributed her inability to finish strong against Capriati
to the same reason given by most of the losing players this week: She
was tired. Very tired.</TE>
<TE>   She said she didn't want to talk about it, then did so at great
length. After winning the second set with a drop shot, Maleeva faded
badly and failed to hold serve in the third set, losing it in 27
minutes. Capriati broke her serve nine times in the match.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I had won, but I think it's really nice to be 27 and
realize you're playing some of your best tennis," Maleeva said. "I
don't want to be one of those players that had their best time when
they were 22 and 23 and then they're kind of always a little bit not
as good."</TE>
<TE>   Maleeva is one of the more honest players on the tour and she was
frank about the general lack of buzz and sparse crowds at this event.
She was asked if it felt like the world championship of women's
tennis, as advertised.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't feel like it, does it?" Maleeva said. "We were all
very excited to come here, and we all fought hard to make the top 16,
so I was glad to make it here. It's really unfortunate to play in
front of those small crowds, but hopefully it will get better."</TE>
<TE>   Where? In Houston? Or back in New York?</TE>
<TE>   "It's just unfortunate you have [Justine] Henin and Clijsters
playing yesterday, two of the best players in the world, and there
were just a few people," Maleeva said.</TE>

<HD>Ebell Makes Sure UCLA Enjoys Breeze in Desert</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TUCSON</DL>
<LD>On a night freshmen quarterbacks Drew Olson and Matt Moore made clear
neither is willing to settle for second-best, UCLA was delighted with
its ascent to a share of third place in the Pacific 10 Conference
standings.</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins are bowl bound after a shockingly easy 37-7 victory
over hapless Arizona in front of a taciturn homecoming crowd of
36,614 Saturday that by the third quarter began repairing to the
restaurants and bars that line the streets near Arizona Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   There was little reason to stay, not even for UCLA fans. Both
quarterbacks had distinguished themselves. The Bruins were well on
their way to improving to 7-3 overall, 4-2 and even with Arizona
State in the Pac-10.</LD>
<TE>   And as any streak-smart Bruin follower knew, there were several
meaningful accomplishments. The word on the streaks was as follows:</TE>
<TE>   * Tyler Ebell rushed for 124 yards and two touchdowns in 22
carries, giving him more than 100 yards in six consecutive games. His
nifty cutback move on a 36-yard run in his first carry made Arizona
defenders look as if they had large auto parts tucked in their socks.</TE>
<TE>   The freshman tailback scored on a 22-yard run in the first
quarter, a 19-yard run in the second and had 111 yards by halftime.
He watched most of the second half from the bench.</TE>
<TE>   "The holes were huge on our sweeps early," Ebell said. "It was
nice to see other guys get in there and run. It reminded me of high
school."</TE>
<TE>   * Neither Olson nor Moore has had a pass intercepted all season.
Olson, the starter, completed seven of 12 for 111 yards and a
touchdown. Moore played the second quarter and some of the fourth,
completing six of eight for 90 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no difference, they both put the ball on the money,"
said receiver Tab Perry, who caught two from Olson for 48 yards and
one from Moore for 41.</TE>
<TE>   * Nate Fikse made three field goals, including a career-longest
51-yarder, stretching his string to 10 in a row in three games since
taking over kicking duties.</TE>
<TE>   He also dropped a punt inside the 10-yard line. And only one of
his kickoffs was returned.</TE>
<TE>   * Dave Ball pitched in on one of the six Bruin sacks, marking the
eighth consecutive game he has had a sack. His twin, Mat, also
notched one, helping reduce the Wildcat rushing total to 12 yards.</TE>
<TE>   * Arizona (3-7, 0-6) extended a streak of its own, losing its
sixth game in a row for the first time in school history. The
once-vaunted Wildcat flex defense was as pliable as putty, giving up
443 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "We just got our tails kicked in the second half," Arizona Coach
John Mackovic said. "When you can't stop them, like we did in the
second half, that really hurts."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's third victory in a row gave the Bruins the distinction of
being only the third team in school history to win five road games in
a season. The fact that it was one-sided made it no less important.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the biggest game of the season," said running back
Manuel White, who returned from an injury that had sidelined him for
five games and scored a third-quarter touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had lost, it would have ruined the whole season, everything
we had accomplished. This was huge."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA will get an invitation to one of the six bowl games
guaranteed to Pac-10 teams. Even if the Bruins lose their last two
regular-season games -- to USC and Washington State -- they can do no
worse than a berth in the Las Vegas Bowl or Silicon Valley Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "Our whole season hinged on this game," defensive tackle Steve
Morgan said. "We didn't want a letdown. We played really hard, right
from the first play."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA seized control early. Ebell dashed 36 yards in his first
carry and 22 yards in his second, scoring a touchdown 2:13 into the
game. Olson connected with Perry for 37 yards on the first play of
the next Bruin possession, which led to a 39-yard field goal by
Fikse.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona showed some life, marching 71 yards, but came up empty
when Spencer Havner blocked a 27-yard field-goal attempt. Havner, a
freshman linebacker with a knack for making big plays, caused a
fumble near midfield a few minutes later that UCLA converted into a
touchdown and 17-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Moore replaced Olson before the 53-yard drive and enabled the
Bruins to overcome three penalties by connecting with Perry for 40
yards on third and 42. Coach Bob Toledo called an option play on
fourth down and Moore pitched to Ebell, who sprinted 19 yards for a
touchdown and 17-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Nic Costa, a redshirt freshman, replaced Jason Johnson at
quarterback for Arizona and a penalty and a sack by Ball and Morgan
pushed the Wildcats back to their eight on third down.</TE>
<TE>   Costa, a left-hander who scrambles well, eluded linebacker Marcus
Reese in the end zone and threw on the run to Andrae Thurman, who
caught the ball at midfield and shook off Ricky Manning for a 92-yard
touchdown, the longest pass play in the Pac-10 this season.</TE>
<TE>   Moore wasn't finished, making accurate throws to Jon Dubravac for
19 yards and Craig Bragg for 22 on the two first plays of the next
Bruin possession and setting up a 51-yard field goal by Fikse and a
20-7 halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   Olson returned in the third quarter and directed three consecutive
scoring drives. The first was set up by a 20-yard punt return by
Bragg, who then took a short pass by Olson and flew up the sideline
for a 33-yard touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   White capped a 61-yard drive with a one-yard touchdown run, the
rout was on and the stands began to empty.</TE>
<TE>   "No question this [loss] hurts the most, in front of our fans, in
our stadium, on homecoming," Mackovic said.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA returns home for a respite, a bye before its rivalry game
against USC.</TE>
<TE>   "We've gone hard for 14 weeks and we all need a break," Toledo
said. "I couldn't be prouder. There was not a letdown. This team is
playing hard."</TE>

<LD>Steve Henson's keys to the game, and how the Bruins measured up:</LD>
<LD>   1. Freshman quarterback Drew Olson and freshman center Mike
McCloskey must avoid getting confused by Arizona's flex defense and
make sound protection calls: The only confusion was from Wildcat
defenders who couldn't catch tailback Tyler Ebell, Olson or anyone
else who handled the ball for UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   2. The freshman quarterbacks must avoid interceptions even while
opening up the offense in measured increments: Neither Olson nor Matt
Moore had a pass intercepted. The offense did open up, and the pair
combined for 201 passing yards, the most since Cory Paus was injured
Oct. 19.</LD>
<TE>   3. Because Wildcats have trouble running, zero in on Arizona
quarterbacks: UCLA had six sacks and put constant pressure on Jason
Johnson and Nic Costa. Dave Ball and Steve Morgan combined on a sack,
Marcus Reese was credited with two, and Mat Ball, C.J. Niusulu and
Rusty Williams each had one.</TE>

<LD>Controversy or contentment?</LD>
<LD>   UCLA isn't about to advance the theory that there's a debate on
who should be the Bruin quarterback.</LD>
<LD>   But freshmen Drew Olson and Matt Moore showed Saturday night in a
37-7 victory over Arizona that neither is ready to concede the job.</LD>
<TE>   "Both quarterbacks did a nice job," Coach Bob Toledo said. "The
media is going to say, 'They've got a quarterback controversy.' We've
got a nice situation. I've got depth. I'm not worried about a
controversy."</TE>
<TE>   Olson hoped to solidify his standing as the No. 1 quarterback, and
his performance certainly didn't hurt that objective. He completed
seven of 12 passes for 111 yards and his first touchdown as a Bruin.
An efficient Olson directed UCLA to five scores -- three touchdowns
and two field goals -- in his six series.</TE>
<TE>   Moore, though, proved equally capable coming off the bench. He
completed six of eight passes for 90 yards and directed the Bruins to
two scores in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Moore said he was pleased with his performance but was
unconcerned about whether it was enough to unseat Olson as the
starter.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll see how next week goes," Moore said. "I'm still open to
everything -- backup, starting, whatever."</TE>
<TE>   Olson believes that he'll continue to be the starter and hinted
that he would feel more comfortable taking a majority of the snaps.</TE>
<TE>   Of splitting time, Olson said, "It's a little tricky. It gets you
out of your rhythm sometimes if you're on a roll, but it really
doesn't matter. As long as each of us goes out and performs, we'll do
fine."</TE>
<TE>   Toledo had promised Moore he would play in the first half after
keeping him on the sideline last week while Olson went the distance
in a 34-24 victory over Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Moore played in four series in the first half, when the former
Newhall Hart High standout displayed poise and passing accuracy.</TE>
<TE>   "I just went out and did what I'm supposed to do," Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   Olson and Moore had near-identical results in the first half.
Olson led the Bruins to a touchdown and a field goal on their first
two possessions for a 10-0 lead before a three-and-out series.</TE>
<TE>   Moore replaced Olson for the next series and engineered drives
resulting in a touchdown and a field goal that increased UCLA's lead
to 20-7 midway through the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   With the Bruins facing third and 42 from their 41 after being
penalized on three successive plays, Moore found wide receiver Tab
Perry streaking down the left sideline for a 40-yard pass play,
setting up a 19-yard scoring run by Tyler Ebell on the next play on
fourth and two. "That was a heck of a pass into two-deep coverage,"
Toledo said.</TE>
<TE>   Olson directed UCLA to two touchdowns, including a 33-yard
catch-and-run by wide receiver Craig Bragg, and a field goal on the
team's first three possessions of the second half before giving way
to Moore in a meaningless fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   In the locker room, Olson said he had no indication if he and
Moore would continue to share playing time. "That's up to Coach
[Toledo]," Olson said. "It's out of our hands. We have no clue."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defensive end Dave Ball had a sack early in the second quarter,
extending his streak to eight games in which he has had at least one.
He has 10 1/2 this season and is closing in on the UCLA record of 13
held by Carnell Lake. The Bruins had six sacks against Arizona,
giving them 16 in the last three games.... Running back Manuel White
played for the first time since straining his left hamstring Oct. 5
against Oregon State. White, who sat out four games, rushed for 27
yards in eight carries, including a one-yard touchdown.... Bragg, who
had three catches for 64 yards and a touchdown, set a UCLA sophomore
record for season receiving yards with 738, breaking the mark of 728
set by J.J. Stokes in 1992.... Senior quarterback Jason Johnson
passed for 133 yards to set Arizona's season record with 2,566 yards,
breaking the mark of 2,520 yards set by Tom Tunnicliffe in 1982.</TE>

<HD>Something's in Air for USC</HD>
<DH>Palmer sets a touchdown pass record and Trojans stay in the
hunt for a big bowl by routing Stanford, 49-17, for fourth
consecutive victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PALO ALTO</DL>
<LD>USC spent two weeks preparing for an opponent that presented the only
obstacle to a fast start in November and possible bowl game in
January.</LD>
<LD>   The 10th-ranked Trojans, rested and ready after a bye, were not
worried about struggling Stanford. They knew they could handle the
Cardinal. The potential problem was complacency.</LD>
<LD>   USC showed no signs of it Saturday at Stanford Stadium in a 49-17
victory before 44,950 that extended the Trojans' winning streak to
four games and kept alive their Rose Bowl hopes.</LD>
<TE>   "We did exactly what we were supposed to do today," middle
linebacker Mike Pollard said. "We didn't let anything stand in the
way. It was business as usual."</TE>
<TE>   USC, which improved to 7-2 overall and 5-1 in the Pacific 10
Conference, will probably climb in the polls today because several
higher-ranked teams lost. The Trojans play Arizona State next week
and they conclude the regular season against UCLA and Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   "There are four steps in November and this is the first one," USC
Coach Pete Carroll said. "We needed to get this one to get going. Our
guys were very tuned in to what's at stake."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans, who had not defeated the Cardinal since 1998, showed
signs of rust in the opening minutes but put together what is fast
becoming a characteristic scoring tear that turned the game into a
rout.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks after erasing a five-point halftime deficit against
Oregon by scoring 30 unanswered points, USC ripped off 28 in a row
against the Cardinal. The outburst turned a 14-10 second-quarter lead
into a 42-10 margin one play into the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   USC scored more than 40 points for the third consecutive game,
tying a feat achieved by the 1972 national championship team, which
scored more than 50 points in victories over Oregon State, Illinois
and Michigan State.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Carson Palmer continued to look like a Heisman Trophy
candidate by completing 22 of 32 passes for 317 yards and four
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer has thrown 13 touchdown passes with only two interceptions
in the last three games. His second touchdown pass Saturday moved him
past Rob Johnson into first place on the school's all-time list. His
fourth extended the record to 61.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody felt a little rusty, but once we got it going I think
everybody felt comfortable," Palmer said. "We should have scored
every time we had the ball."</TE>
<TE>   The victory was in marked contrast to the last time USC played at
Stanford Stadium. In 2000, Cardinal quarterback Chris Lewis came off
the bench and completed a 20-yard touchdown pass on the final play of
a 32-30 victory that devastated USC.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans expected to see Lewis again, but the redshirt junior
from Long Beach did not play for the third consecutive game because
of a shoulder bruise.</TE>
<TE>   Kyle Matter, a redshirt freshman from Newhall, started again in
Lewis' place and had his best performance of the season. Matter
completed his first 15 passes and finished 23 of 35, but he totaled
only 165 yards with two touchdowns and one interception.</TE>
<TE>   Running back Kerry Carter, who scored four touchdowns against the
Trojans two years ago, gained 37 yards in seven carries during a
Cardinal scoring drive that tied the score, 7-7, in the first
quarter. But the Trojans limited Carter to 37 yards the rest of the
way.</TE>
<TE>   Safety Troy Polamalu led USC with 13 tackles, and linebacker Matt
Grootegoed had three of the Trojans' season-high seven sacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Our fears were that the speed of the game, after two weeks, can
get you," Carroll said. "It nailed us in the first quarter. We
couldn't tackle anyone. Once we got going and adjusted, we were
fine."</TE>
<TE>   Stanford (2-7, 1-5) helped the Trojans score their first two
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   After Stanford went three and out on the first possession, USC did
the same the first time it got the ball. But Tom Malone's punt landed
deep in Cardinal territory and the ball hit Stanford's T.J. Rushing
before Justin Wyatt recovered for USC.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans wasted no time taking advantage of the break.</TE>
<TE>   Flanker Keary Colbert beat sophomore cornerback Stanley Wilson and
Palmer lofted him a 17-yard touchdown pass for a 7-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinal tied the score with 4:50 left in the first quarter on
a six-yard touchdown pass from Matter to Ryan Wells that culminated a
74-yard, 13-play drive.</TE>
<TE>   But Stanford aided the Trojans on the next possession when it was
penalized for pass interference and for having 12 men on the field on
consecutive plays.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, Palmer went for the big play, connecting with tight
end Alex Holmes on a 26-yard gain. Two plays later, Mike Williams
scored on an eight-yard touchdown pass that gave Palmer the record.</TE>
<TE>   After a Stanford field goal, Justin Fargas followed his 19-yard
gain by bulling his way into the end zone for a seven-yard touchdown
and a 21-10 lead with 5:50 left in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer connected with Colbert on a 13-yard touchdown pass play on
the first possession of the third quarter to extend the lead to
28-10. Two plays after Trojan defensive lineman Kenechi Udeze
intercepted a pass with 8:31 left in the quarter, Palmer and Holmes
connected on a 22-yard scoring play for a 35-10 lead. The Trojans
completed the onslaught on the first play of the fourth quarter when
Malaefou MacKenzie scored on a four-yard run.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans now can look ahead to next week's game against Arizona
State, which lost to California, 55-38. Off in the distance await
UCLA, Notre Dame and a potential berth in the Rose Bowl or another
bowl championship series game.</TE>
<TE>   "The opportunity is there -- it's on the table," Palmer said. "We
don't have to worry about who's winning, who's losing and what our
BCS ranking is.</TE>
<TE>   "We just have to go out and keep winning. If we do that, we'll be
in a good position."</TE>

<TE>   KEYS TO THE GAME</TE>
<TE>   Gary Klein's keys to the game, and how the Trojans measured up:</TE>
<TE>   1. Avoid complacency. The Trojans came out and stuffed Stanford on
the first possession of the game and went on to take a 21-10 halftime
lead. The Trojans scored on their first two possessions of the second
half en route to the easy victory.</TE>
<TE>   2. Maintain the running game. Trojans entered the game averaging
116.9 yards a game and finished with 87. Justin Fargas, who gained a
career-best 139 yards two weeks ago against Oregon, rushed for 43
yards in nine carries and scored a touchdown. Malaefou MacKenzie
gained 41 yards in three carries and scored a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   3. Special teams. The Trojans avoided the blocked field-goal and
extra-point attempts that plagued them throughout their first eight
games. Tom Malone averaged 41.8 yards for five punts and Ryan Killeen
made all seven of his extra-point attempts.</TE>

<HD>Spirit of Troy Returns to the Defense</HD>
<DH>Polamalu delivers big hit and draws a penalty against
Stanford, but his comeback from ankle injury inspires USC.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas Bonk</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PALO ALTO</DL>
<LD>The pass intended for Stanford receiver Teyo Johnson was over his
head at the sidelines, but Troy Polamalu didn't hesitate. Polamalu
knocked Johnson to the ground with a hit that caused many to shudder
in the crowd of 44,950, not to mention Johnson.</LD>
<LD>   But there was a problem with Polamalu's crushing blow -- he did it
right in front of an official, who dropped a penalty flag at
Polamalu's feet for a personal foul.</LD>
<LD>   "I should have pulled up," Polamalu said afterward. "But in that
split second, I was thinking 'Man, he's huge, I've got to take my
chances. What if he catches it and I let him get away?'</LD>
<TE>   "In some ways it was worth the penalty. I hit him when he was out
of bounds, though, and I do apologize for that."</TE>
<TE>   It was an aggressive defensive play and far from an apologetic
hit, but it probably serves as a significant signpost along the road
for the USC Trojans, who blew out the Stanford Cardinal, 49-17, at
Stanford Stadium, and then retreated to the locker room to feel good
about themselves.</TE>
<TE>   At 7-2 and 5-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference, good will is flowing
for the Trojans, only not on defense, where the best news is that
Polamalu is making hits again. They're occurring all over the field,
and, as Johnson learned Saturday night, sometimes off of it as well.</TE>
<TE>   Polamalu is the USC strong safety with the weak right ankle. He
injured it on the first series at Washington State, the only
conference defeat the Trojans have endured. That was a month ago, but
as recently as Tuesday, Polamalu had X-rays because he didn't feel it
was getting any better.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to have to play hurt with it the rest of the year,"
Coach Pete Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   Against Stanford, Polamalu led the USC defense with 13 tackles,
seven of them unassisted. He had two tackles for losses and one sack
and didn't let on for a single play that he was not at full strength.</TE>
<TE>   "He's still not 100%," quarterback Carson Palmer said. "But even
when he's 80%, he's still the best player on the field."</TE>
<TE>   Only three more games remain for USC -- next week against Arizona
State, at the Rose Bowl against UCLA and at the Coliseum against
Notre Dame. And while Palmer and the offense have put up 41, 44 and
49 points in USC's last three games, more of the burden is expected
to be on the defense in a closing rush.</TE>
<TE>   In that case, every Trojan helmet turns toward Polamalu.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great to have him back there," linebacker Matt Grootegoed
said. "When he's not there, you get nervous. He's our leader."</TE>
<TE>   That is why Carroll depends so much on the senior from Tenmile,
Ore., a preseason Thorpe Award candidate as the nation's top
defensive back.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a very special part of our defense, with his flexibility and
style and all he commands," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   What Polamalu commands mostly is the ability to deliver blows to
offensive players. Defense, the way Polamalu plays it, is all about
sudden impact. But when he fell to the ground in the first quarter
Oct. 5 at Pullman, he was just hoping he wasn't out for the season.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, Lord, I thought it was my knee, you know, because everything
went numb," he said. "Then I said a prayer and I could thank God
because it wasn't my knee, only a sprained ankle. It could have been
so much worse."</TE>
<TE>   The way Polamalu sees his role on defense, it is not so much as a
team leader or a delivery man for punishment, but only to do his job.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a bunch of great leaders on this team," he said. "My
game, what I do, it's not about big hits, it's only about making the
plays I'm supposed to make. And the good thing is, we're feeding off
each other."</TE>
<TE>   And so it goes for the Trojans and their high-scoring offense and
pounding defense. Of course, shutting down an ineffective Stanford
group is no longer a huge task, but for a strong safety with a sore
ankle and a USC team looking for inspiration, it was about as good as
it could be.</TE>

<HD>Washington State Clears Hurdle</HD>
<DH>No. 5 Cougars stop Oregon's Smith on way to 32-21 victory,
which puts them one step closer to Pac-10 title and keeps them in BCS
race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PULLMAN, Wash.</DL>
<LD>The difference between the top two scoring teams in the Pacific 10
Conference came down to Washington State's defense.</LD>
<LD>   The fifth-ranked Cougars reined in the league's top rusher,
Onterrio Smith, and Jason Gesser threw four touchdown passes and
Jermaine Green ran for a career-high 180 yards in Washington State's
32-21 victory over No. 15 Oregon on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "The defense played unbelievably. They never gave Onterrio Smith a
break," Washington State Coach Mike Price said. "They pressured the
quarterback all the time."</LD>
<TE>   The Cougars, 9-1 overall and 6-0 in the conference, moved within
one victory of clinching a trip to the Rose Bowl. And with No. 1
Oklahoma's loss, Washington State might climb up from fifth in the
bowl championship series standings, which determine who plays for the
national title.</TE>
<TE>   Green easily outperformed Oregon's banged-up star tailback, Smith,
who was leading the conference at nearly 127 yards a game despite
missing last week's victory over Stanford because of a sore left
knee.</TE>
<TE>   A year after he ran for a school-record 285 yards and three
touchdowns in Oregon's 24-17 victory over the Cougars, Smith carried
the ball 25 times for only 64 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, they over-pursued and were too aggressive. That
resulted in big plays," Oregon Coach Mike Bellotti said. "This year,
they played it much safer. They kept their tackles home and played
more cautiously to keep him contained. Onterrio is probably not 100%.
He has a sore toe. They did a very good job of stopping him."</TE>
<TE>   Oregon came into the game as the No. 1 scoring offense in the
league, averaging 37.9 points per game, followed by Washington State,
with 34.6.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State beat the Ducks (7-3, 3-3) for the first time
since 1997 and the first time in Martin Stadium since 1996. The
unusual schedule had Oregon playing in Pullman for the third straight
time in the series.</TE>
<TE>   "We finally got it done," Gesser said. "When somebody beats you up
three times, you really want to get them back."</TE>
<TE>   Jason Fife threw a 16-yard scoring pass to Jason Willis, but it
was the Ducks' defense that provided the rest of the team's points,
returning a fumble and an interception for touchdowns. Fife completed
16 of 35 for 192 yards and an interception.</TE>
<TE>   Gesser threw touchdown passes of three and four yards to Mike Bush
and two more to Devard Darling covering eight and 46 yards. Gesser
completed 20 of 38 passes for 277 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Bush caught nine passes for 107 yards and Darling had seven
catches and 133 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Gesser said the Cougars planned to pick on the Ducks' shorter
corners.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew their corners were not as good as our receivers," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We said, 'If you want to go one-on-one, our guys are better than
your guys.' "</TE>
<TE>   The Cougars have next week off before playing Washington at home
and UCLA at the Rose Bowl on Dec. 7.</TE>

<HD>Cigarettes, Greed and Betrayal: An Insider's Saga</HD>
<DH>Rogue employee or Big Tobacco fall guy? Les Thompson tells
tales from the vortex of the Canadian smuggling scandal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myron Levin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Les Thompson was a self-made man. He grew up poor in a small town in
Ontario and got no further than high school. Still, he fashioned a
nice career in the cigarette business, rising through the ranks at
the Canadian arm of R.J. Reynolds.</LD>
<LD>   In the early 1990s, he took on a big and risky assignment: helping
the company gain a foothold in Canada's exploding market for
contraband cigarettes. As a regional field manager for RJR-MacDonald
Inc., he supplied cigarettes to U.S. distributors, who had them
smuggled back into Canada across the St. Lawrence River to avoid
Canadian taxes.</LD>
<LD>   With Thompson's help, the company amassed more than $600 million
in revenue and more than $100 million in profit from contraband
sales, Canadian authorities have alleged.</LD>
<TE>   Thompson's superiors rewarded him with a promotion and lavish
praise. Then, some of the distributors were arrested. And they began
pointing fingers at him.</TE>
<TE>   He pleaded guilty to money laundering and spent two years in a
U.S. prison. He became the most notorious figure in the smuggling
boom that prompted Canada to rescind a steep tax increase meant to
curb smoking.</TE>
<TE>   An obscure unit of R.J. Reynolds pleaded guilty to a
smuggling-related offense and paid $15 million in fines. But the
company emerged otherwise unscathed. It portrayed Thompson as a rogue
employee who had strayed from its law-abiding corporate culture by,
among other things, accepting improper gifts from the distributors.</TE>
<TE>   Though he was hauled off in disgrace, Thompson didn't really go
away. Released from prison in January, he has emerged as a key figure
in civil suits and criminal investigations into the global trade in
contraband smokes. He has been cooperating with investigators from
the United States and the European Union.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking forward to going to court and telling the story under
oath," he said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Information provided by Thompson was central to a lawsuit by the
Canadian government that sought to recover $1 billion in lost taxes
and law enforcement costs from RJR. The case, dismissed last year by
a U.S. court, is expected to be refiled in Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson has also told his insider's story to Canadian
investigators in a probe that is expected to result in criminal
charges against tobacco firms, officials and suppliers -- possibly
including his former superiors at RJR-MacDonald.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson, who traded a good career and the promise of a bountiful
retirement for a rap sheet, said he has never stopped wondering: Why
only me?</TE>
<TE>   Interviewed at his home in Canada, Thompson portrayed himself not
as a renegade but as an obliging cog in a wheel of corruption. There
was no way a mid-level executive could fill multimillion-dollar
orders for cigarettes without the approval of superiors, he said.
Prosecutors on both sides of the border have said the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of R.J. Reynolds referred questions about Thompson
to Japan Tobacco International, which acquired Reynolds'
international business in 1999. A spokesman for Japan Tobacco, Guy
Cote, said the company could not comment because of the Canadian
investigation. But he cautioned against taking the word of "a
convicted felon" who took kickbacks.</TE>
<TE>   If Canadian authorities bring new charges against tobacco
executives, Thompson could be a key witness -- a situation he would
relish.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not asking anyone to pass me a handkerchief here," he said.
"But it's important to me that the story doesn't end with Les
Thompson."</TE>
<TE>   Diverted Exports</TE>
<TE>   Experts say a quarter to a third of cigarette exports worldwide
winds up getting diverted from legal channels and smuggled across
international boundaries. This cheats governments of tax revenue and
encourages smoking by keeping supplies of cheap cigarettes on the
market.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, cigarettes have been used around the world as common
currency for laundering profits from drug trafficking and other
crimes, allegedly with the collusion of tobacco companies, according
to a suit filed last month by the European Union against R.J.
Reynolds. The company called the charge "absurd."</TE>
<TE>   As for their purported role in cigarette smuggling, tobacco
companies have vigorously denied responsibility, saying they sell
their products legally and can't track them through every twist and
turn of the distribution chain. At the same time, the firms have used
smuggling as a powerful argument against cigarette tax hikes.</TE>
<TE>   This is the scenario that played out in Canada, where the
government waged war on smoking by imposing tax increases that nearly
doubled the price of a pack.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, cigarette exports to the United States from
Canada rose more than tenfold. Americans had not suddenly developed a
taste for Canadian brands. The Canadian cigarettes, exported tax-free
to U.S. distributors, were smuggled back into Canada, without the
baggage of more than $3 a pack in federal and provincial taxes.</TE>
<TE>   The tobacco companies themselves didn't do the smuggling. They
supplied middlemen, who supplied the smugglers, court records show.
Insulated by intermediaries from the dirty work, tobacco executives
described theirs as a "gray market" business, Thompson recalled.</TE>
<TE>   The hub for this traffic was the Akwesasne Mohawk Indian
Reservation, which straddles the border in upstate New York and
southern Ontario, stretching across a narrow reach of the St.
Lawrence River that can be crossed by small boats throughout the
year.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989 and 1990, the reservation was convulsed by violence
involving feuding tribal factions and police. To cool things down,
police reduced their presence. For cigarette smugglers, it was
wide-open turf.</TE>
<TE>   A Lucrative Enterprise</TE>
<TE>   As the contraband market exploded, RJR-MacDonald's American
parent, RJR Nabisco, was staggering under $26 billion in debt
resulting from a leveraged buyout by a group of investors. It needed
all the help its far-flung units could give. Yet of the three big
cigarette makers in Canada, RJR-MacDonald was a distant third behind
Imperial Tobacco Ltd. and Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. If those
competitors prevailed in the contraband market, the gap could widen.</TE>
<TE>   From his sales office in a Toronto suburb, Les Thompson saw the
problem firsthand. His otherwise-loyal secretary smoked Players, a
rival brand, for a simple reason. At the bingo hall, where cigarettes
were cheap, Players was the only brand in stock.</TE>
<TE>   "In defense of Reynolds, they didn't invent that business,"
Thompson said. "It wasn't a new concept by any stretch of the
imagination."</TE>
<TE>   Thompson said that in March 1992 -- on orders from Ed Lang, then
chief executive of RJR-MacDonald, and Stan Smith, then vice president
of sales -- he had lunch at the Como Restaurant in Niagara Falls,
N.Y., with three men who would become his biggest customers. (Lang,
Smith and their lawyers declined to be interviewed.)</TE>
<TE>   The three, Larry Miller and brothers Robert and Lewis Tavano, had
colorful pasts. Robert Tavano, a former Republican Party chairman of
Niagara County, went to prison in the 1970s for stealing county
insurance premiums. Lewis Tavano, a sports bookmaker in Las Vegas,
had been indicted with several others, including former Buffalo crime
boss Stefano Maggadino, in a gambling case -- though charges were
dismissed because of an illegal wiretap.</TE>
<TE>   The men had formed a partnership, named LBL Importing (for Larry,
Bob and Lewis), to sell Canadian cigarettes to Indian traders on the
Mohawk reservation. They were moving large volumes of Rothmans
cigarettes to warehouses there, Thompson recalled. And they were sure
they would have similar success with Export A, RJR-MacDonald's top
brand.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson said he reported to Smith that this looked like a great
opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "The mind-set was that you've got an underperforming business
unit," he said. "Here were some people who were making very strong
statements that they could deliver the types of volumes that were
expected of the operation."</TE>
<TE>   Approval of new customers at RJR-MacDonald was usually a long,
laborious process, but LBL was fast-tracked, according to Thompson
and the Canadian lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Within weeks, the cigarette maker and LBL were doing a brisk
business.</TE>
<TE>   About the same time, the lawsuit said, RJR-MacDonald took further
steps to penetrate the black market.</TE>
<TE>   Early in '92, the Canadian government briefly imposed a cigarette
export tax as an anti-smuggling measure. Anticipating the move, the
company shifted two production lines from its Montreal factory to a
cigarette plant in Puerto Rico.</TE>
<TE>   For the next several years, the offshore plant made Export A's for
the contraband market. According to Thompson and the Canadian
lawsuit, when the Puerto Rican plant opened, Miller and the Tavanos
were among the guests given tours.</TE>
<TE>   RJR-MacDonald also contracted with a North Carolina factory to
produce Export A "fine cut," the loose tobacco used to hand-roll
cigarettes. The fine cut also was smuggled into Canada, according to
the government lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson said that on numerous occasions, his superiors reassured
him that he was not putting himself in legal peril. He said a lawyer
who sat on the RJR-MacDonald board told him: "It's a gray business.
It's a loophole. It's not pretty, but we've got to be there."</TE>
<TE>   Thompson said his superiors provided more than $1 million a year
for high-end junkets for the black marketeers and company executives.</TE>
<TE>   He said the special customers were taken bonefishing in the
Bahamas, to luxurious golf clubs and to the major league baseball
World Series in Toronto -- always flying first class and staying in
the finest digs. They were frequent guests at the Sonora Island
Lodge, a $1,000-a-day fishing resort on a remote island off the coast
of British Columbia, according to Thompson and the lodge's owner at
the time, Michael Gallant.</TE>
<TE>   "They loved to fish, they liked to party," Thompson said. His
superiors saw it as "an opportunity to keep the momentum going and
satisfy the appetite of the customer," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson said he took part in about 15 of these junkets -- and
felt as if he had entered a parallel universe of the rich and famous.</TE>
<TE>   He recalled a reception at a Formula One race in Montreal, where
guests rubbed elbows with race car driver Niki Lauda. Thompson said
he considered himself the kind of guy who should be sitting in the
bleachers "with a hot dog and warm beer ... and here we are
entertaining RJR's gray marketeers in the paddock areas with
awning-type suites."</TE>
<TE>   Though Thompson enjoyed himself, he said, he was somewhat troubled
by the excess.</TE>
<TE>   But he did not let this interfere with the business at hand.</TE>
<TE>   "I bought into the program with little, if any, hesitation," he
said. "I wanted to do what's expected of me, and I wanted to
succeed."</TE>
<TE>   At the peak, Thompson said, RJR-MacDonald made a weekly profit of
$1.2 million to $1.3 million from the contraband trade and saw an
increase in its market share.</TE>
<TE>   When a member of his sales team toured Akwesasne in 1993, the
numbers told it all.</TE>
<TE>   The salesman visited six tobacco warehouses on the reservation to
see how stocks of Export A compared with those of rival brands. At
all six warehouses, Export A volumes were as high as, or higher than,
those of any of the competitors' cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   "The availability of black market cigarettes ... in Canada has
increased tenfold over the last two years," the salesman told
Thompson in a memo, a copy of which was obtained by The Times. The
salesman described such cigarettes as "easily available at virtually
every street corner to a hungry smoking population."</TE>
<TE>   By this time, contraband busts had become a staple of TV news --
the Canadian version of police pursuits on L.A. freeways. Thompson
recalled two RJR-MacDonald vice presidents bantering as they watched
a report of a seizure of rival brands. One of them teased Thompson
about not having any "market share" in the bust, while the other
quipped that Thompson's customers were just better at not getting
caught.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, company executives feared embarrassment or worse if the
footprints led to RJR-MacDonald's door. So, Thompson said, they
created a separate company to feed the contraband market. They called
it Northern Brands International, and they located it far from
Canada.</TE>
<TE>   The company was incorporated in Delaware at the end of 1992 and
headquartered in Winston-Salem, N.C. It operated out of 401 N. Main
St., the Art Deco office tower that also served as headquarters for
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and R.J. Reynolds International.</TE>
<TE>   Officers and directors of the fledgling firm included at least two
senior vice presidents of the international unit.</TE>
<TE>   Early in 1993, Thompson and a colleague, Peter MacGregor, were
sent to Winston-Salem to run NBI -- Thompson as head of sales and
MacGregor as finance director. MacGregor and his lawyer declined to
be interviewed. Along with a third employee, they constituted the
entire work force.</TE>
<TE>   At his send-off in Canada, Thompson's colleagues gave him a
special going-away gift -- an Indian headdress.</TE>
<TE>   The contraband business grew even bigger under NBI.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, 5 billion of the 8 billion cigarettes produced by
RJR-MacDonald were sold through NBI to black-market suppliers and
then funneled back to Canada, according to Canada's lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   In October 1993, Ed Lang, the head of RJR-MacDonald, touted NBI's
performance at a briefing with the chief executive of RJR Nabisco,
the Canadian lawsuit said. According to the lawsuit, Lang said NBI's
quarterly earnings were $58 million, prompting the RJR Nabisco CEO to
ask how the pipsqueak firm could possibly bring in so much cash.</TE>
<TE>   Before Lang could respond, the CEO said he remembered that NBI was
in the "feather" business in upstate New York -- a reference to the
Indian connection -- the lawsuit states.</TE>
<TE>   Although not named in the suit, RJR Nabisco's CEO at the time was
Charles Harper. Harper, 75 and retired, said in an interview that he
could not recall such a conversation.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a straight-up kind of company," Harper said from his
home in Omaha. "Our deal was that we were not going to do anything
that was illegal."</TE>
<TE>   Always the solid performer, Thompson suddenly became something of
a hero. Now, he said, Lang called him "partner," while colleagues
greeted him as the "Indian Trader" or yelled war whoops when he
passed.</TE>
<TE>   He was promoted to regional director and soon after, in June 1993,
got a letter of thanks from RJR-MacDonald President Pierre Brunelle.
"Your hard work and dedication to the company have made a significant
contribution to the success we have realized over the years
especially in recent months," Brunelle wrote.</TE>
<TE>   That December, at the company Christmas party at Casa Loma, an
ornate castle-turned-banquet-hall in Toronto, Thompson and MacGregor
were flown in from Winston-Salem as special guests. As they entered
the room, Thompson recalled, they received a standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   Incentives for Crooks</TE>
<TE>   The tobacco companies blamed the rampant smuggling on the Canadian
government, saying excessive taxation had created irresistible
incentives for crooks. But a 1993 letter that surfaced years later in
U.S. tobacco litigation suggested that the companies knowingly
exploited the black market.</TE>
<TE>   The letter was from R. Don Brown, chairman of Imperial Tobacco,
Canada's largest cigarette maker, to his superior in London, Ulrich
Herter, managing director for tobacco at Imperial's parent,
British-American Tobacco.</TE>
<TE>   "As you are aware, smuggled cigarettes due to exorbitant tax
levels represent nearly 30 percent of total sales in Canada, and the
level is growing," Brown wrote. "Although we agreed to support the
Federal government's effort to reduce smuggling by limiting our
exports to the U.S.A., our competitors did not.</TE>
<TE>   "Subsequently, we have decided to remove the limits on our exports
to regain our share of Canadian smokers.... Until the smuggling issue
is resolved, an increasing volume of our domestic sales in Canada
will be exported, then smuggled back for sale here."</TE>
<TE>   With the market drowning in contraband cigarettes, the Canadian
government in 1994 adopted the tax-cutting fix that cigarette makers
had relentlessly promoted. On top of slicing 50 cents from the
federal tax, the government offered to match additional cigarette tax
rollbacks by the provinces.</TE>
<TE>   These measures slashed cigarette taxes by $1.92 a pack in Ontario
and $2.10 in Quebec. Smuggling sharply declined.</TE>
<TE>   For tobacco companies, whose products were suddenly legally
available at a deep discount, it was a tremendous victory. Public
health groups cried foul, arguing that the tax cuts over time would
re- sult in thousands of additional smoking-related deaths. Canadian
Prime Minister Jean Chretien voiced bitterness too.</TE>
<TE>   "The Canadian manufacturers have benefited directly from this
illegal trade," he said. "They have known perfectly well that their
tobacco exports to the United States have been reentering Canada
illegally."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in the U.S., cigarette makers made certain the lessons
of Canada would not be lost on citizens or tax-minded politicians.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the Canadian rollback, a group with a public-interest
veneer -- the National Coalition Against Crime and Tobacco Contraband
-- set up shop in Washington, D.C. It was underwritten by R.J.
Reynolds.</TE>
<TE>   The coalition commissioned studies to draw press attention to the
link between cigarette taxes and smuggling. Its top consultant and
spokesman was Rod Stamler, a former officer of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police, who had previously done a report for Canadian
cigarette makers attacking the Canadian taxes.</TE>
<TE>   In August 1994, with a tax hike proposal pending in Congress,
Stamler issued a new report, saying the measure could "provide
organized criminals with one of their most attractive profit-making
opportunities since Prohibition."</TE>
<TE>   This would be the industry's mantra.</TE>
<TE>   In April 1998, Steven F. Goldstone, chairman and chief executive
of RJR Nabisco, led Big Tobacco's campaign against a sweeping tobacco
control bill that included a record increase of $1.10 in the federal
cigarette tax.</TE>
<TE>   In speeches to such groups as Wall Street analysts and the
National Press Club, Goldstone warned that the tax, if approved,
would unleash a wave of smuggling like that seen across the border.</TE>
<TE>   "If Washington creates a raging black market for cheap cigarettes
on street corners and in schoolyards, the people will be furious,"
Goldstone said in one speech. "And they will ask, just as they did in
Canada: 'How did we get ourselves into this terrible mess?' "</TE>
<TE>   The tobacco bill was defeated.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Goldstone, who is no longer with the company, said
the executive had no idea when he gave those speeches that an RJR
subsidiary "would wind up ... involved in a plea related to that type
of activity. He was outraged."</TE>
<TE>   A Business Collapses</TE>
<TE>   To this point, authorities had not accused RJR of involvement in
the Canadian smuggling. That was about to change.</TE>
<TE>   Undercover agents on both sides of the border had infiltrated some
of the contraband rings. In June 1997, Larry Miller, the Tavanos and
18 employees and associates were arrested and charged in Syracuse,
N.Y., with numerous smuggling-related crimes. All 21 defendants would
eventually plead guilty to reduced charges.</TE>
<TE>   Within days of the arrests, Les Thompson got a phone call from a
special agent with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,
inviting him for a chat. Thompson recalled the agent saying:
"Everybody we're talking to are offering to make a deal, and they are
pointing a finger in your direction."</TE>
<TE>   "My heart was just racing like a madman," Thompson said. In
retrospect, he added, his big mistake was in not accepting the
invitation and telling what he knew from day one. Instead, he kept
quiet and trusted the company to protect him.</TE>
<TE>   Another shock came in August, when Thompson and his wife, Kathy,
came home in Winston-Salem after a round of golf to find news crews
parked on their lawn. Thompson's name had surfaced in the New York
smuggling case.</TE>
<TE>   In September 1997, RJR International sent Thompson on temporary
assignment, to conduct a marketing study in Florida. In reality,
Thompson said, it was make-work meant to keep him off the public
radar. He and his wife were put up in a south Florida resort
condominium at company expense. Under other circumstances, this might
have been the high life.</TE>
<TE>   But Thompson was filled with dread, knowing his career -- and his
freedom -- were in jeopardy.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a nervous wreck," he recalled. "People would slam car
doors, and I would just jump off the curb."</TE>
<TE>   Still, it was comforting to know he had a rich and powerful
company behind him, and top-notch legal talent in his corner too.</TE>
<TE>   A diet of rah-rah speeches from company executives calmed Thompson
as well. He was told that he had nothing to worry about, that if
everyone stuck together it would all come out fine. At a meeting in
Toronto in April 1998, Thompson said, Paul Bourassa, then general
counsel of RJR International, told him: "The government's
saber-rattling.... Stand tall.... Nobody's leaving the boat."</TE>
<TE>   Bourassa, now general counsel of Japan Tobacco International, did
not respond to requests for comment.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 22, 1998, in federal court in Syracuse, Northern Brands
left the boat -- pleading guilty to a single smuggling-related tax
offense. It was the first time a major tobacco company or affiliate
had been convicted of a federal crime. In exchange for the plea and
$15 million in penalties, federal authorities agreed not to bring
charges against the big names of the corporate family: RJR Nabisco,
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., R.J. Reynolds International.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors said there was no question NBI had done their
dirty work. NBI was established "with the understanding that there
was money to be made by smuggling cigarettes back into Canada," U.S.
Atty. Thomas J. Maroney said.</TE>
<TE>   For Thompson, who was portrayed in the NBI indictment as a key
figure in the scheme, it was the beginning of the end.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson began negotiating a severance with RJR and headed back to
Canada. In February 1999, while waiting in a Canadian hotel for the
furniture to arrive, Thompson got a call from U.S. Customs asking him
to go to the border to sign for his things. Arriving at the Customs
station, he was handcuffed, whisked off to jail and soon hauled to a
lockup in Syracuse.</TE>
<TE>   He faced two counts of laundering profits from the smuggling
scheme. Facing a possible term of 20 years and a $500,000 fine,
Thompson struck a deal. He pleaded guilty to one count, was sentenced
to nearly six years in prison, fined $20,000 and ordered to forfeit
more than $85,000 in gifts -- including cash, a used Cadillac and
golf lessons he had accepted from Miller and the Tavanos.</TE>
<TE>   The sentence permitted Thompson's transfer in two years to
Canadian custody, where he was likely to be paroled quickly.</TE>
<TE>   RJR fired Thompson, taking away his pension and stock options that
he says would have been worth several hundred thousand dollars. He
had to tap his retirement account to pay legal costs and fines.</TE>
<TE>   In a proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the company sought to distance itself from him:
"Employees are prohibited from engaging in smuggling or other
violations of the law. No corporate policy can eliminate the risk
that dishonest individuals, including company employees, will find
ways to circumvent controls for their own personal benefit."</TE>
<TE>   At a court hearing in Canada in February 2000, Thompson pleaded
guilty to Canadian charges and was sentenced to probation as part of
an agreement to cooperate with authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Canadian prosecutor Michael Bernstein told the court: "Mr.
Thompson was not on a lark of his own here. He did not commit this
crime by himself. His acts were part and parcel of a corporate
strategy developed largely by senior executives who closely monitored
and supervised his work. It was the companies who made the huge
profits here."</TE>
<TE>   Then RJR-MacDonald lawyer Douglas Hunt addressed the court, making
an unsuccessful request to file "a victim impact statement." The
company had "suffered physical or emotional loss as a result of the
commission of the offense," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson was sent to the federal prison at Butner, N.C., so he
could cooperate with a federal grand jury in Raleigh investigating
whether RJR had played a role in tobacco smuggling in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   In prison, Thompson, a nonsmoker, found that the best way to cope
was to exhaust himself in physical activity. As a younger man, he had
been a distance runner, with a personal best in the marathon of 3
hours, 16 minutes. Even past 50, he was trim and fit.</TE>
<TE>   In prison, everyone had a job, and Thompson became the leader of
the aerobics classes. He impressed younger inmates with the number of
chin-ups he could do.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson also was named third baseman on the over-40 all-star
softball team. His pride was tinged with anxiety, as he had won the
position over a murderer known as "Hacksaw."</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, Thompson read everything he could get his hands on,
avoided the TV room, where the fights broke out, and dreamed of
better days.</TE>
<TE>   Taped to the refrigerator at the Thompsons' home is a card Les
sent from prison to wife Kathy. Along with two pictures -- of a hiker
silhouetted against a snowcapped peak and a pair of kayakers on a
down-river run -- is a handwritten note: "A few of the activities we
will plan on my return."</TE>
<TE>   Starting Over</TE>
<TE>   Thompson got out of prison in January and settled in a small
Canadian town that he asked not be identified. Finding a good job is
never easy at 55. And it doesn't help if an otherwise-strong resume
has a mysterious three-year gap.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole stigma of what I've been through carries huge baggage
with some of these companies," he said. "You're really forced pretty
far down the food chain."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, in early September, Thompson landed a marketing job at a
small company, making a fraction of the $111,000 salary he had earned
during his best year at RJR-MacDonald. It was a great relief to be
back at work and productive again.</TE>
<TE>   "Different things happen to us as we're growing up," he said. "I
got through it. I've got my family ... I'm a healthy guy, and I'm a
much better per- son."</TE>
<TE>   No matter what he might do in the future, Thompson said, "I'm
going to feel better about it than what I did for Reynolds."</TE>

<TE>   The traffic in smuggled smokes</TE>
<TE>   In the early and mid-1990s, billions of cigarettes were exported
from Canada and then smuggled back in to avoid steep Canadian tobacco
taxes. Here is how the process typically worked, according to
Canadian authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Step 1: Tobacco companies in Canada export cigarettes. Since the
cigarettes supposedly will not be sold in Canada, they are not
subject to tobacco taxes. The shipments go to free-trade zones in
U.S. border areas.</TE>
<TE>   Step 2: Distributors take possession of cigarettes and transport
them to the Akwesasne Mohawk Reservation in upstate New York, where
they are sold to members of smuggling rings who store them in
warehouses.</TE>
<TE>   Step 3: Smugglers transport the cigarettes across the St. Lawrence
River on small boats.</TE>
<TE>   Step 4: Contraband cigarettes are sold cheaply in bingo halls,
stores and parking lots.</TE>
