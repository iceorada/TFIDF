<HD>'Dahmer' Falls Short of the Horrible Truth</HD>
<DH>The story of the notorious serial killer was told with less
money but more depth in an earlier project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Jacobson's "Dahmer" is an admirably serious attempt to explore
the twisted psyche of notorious Milwaukee serial killer Jeffrey
Dahmer.</LD>
<LD>   Ironically, for all its painstaking qualities, it is not as
successful in illuminating that troubled individual as the
low-low-budget, direct-to-video "The Secret Life: Jeffrey Dahmer"
(1993), directed by David R. Bowen and starring Carl Crew, who also
wrote the script.</LD>
<LD>   Jacobson had a large enough budget to shoot establishing shots in
Milwaukee and carefully blend in L.A. settings, but Bowen had no
choice but to shoot in Southern California without apologies.</LD>
<TE>   The lack of authentic settings--and the presence of some cheesy
Grand Guignol props--was ultimately not so important because Bowen
and Crew were able to evoke the internalized homophobia that
motivated Dahmer to kill and eat young men..</TE>
<TE>   That Dahmer would have had no trouble attracting other gay men
lent his story a terrible, terrifying poignancy.</TE>
<TE>   None of this comes across with equal clarity in "Dahmer," which
recalls "Boys Don't Cry" in muffling the larger implications of the
fate of a real-life homosexual individual in American society.</TE>
<TE>   Although stockier, Crew bore an uncanny resemblance to the killer;
the new film's Jeffrey (Jeremy Renner) is not nearly as attractive as
Dahmer, whom he resembles only slightly, and is depicted as a nerd.</TE>
<TE>   Renner gives a focused, understated portrayal in a challenging
role, but it's hard to imagine his Jeffrey attracting so many
victims.</TE>
<TE>   "Dahmer" moves with a slowness that's meant to be compelling but
is largely merely glum. This becomes a hindrance to building suspense
in telling a true story whose outcome is already well known (Dahmer
was murdered at age 34 in 1994 by a fellow inmate while serving a
957-year prison sentence for 17 murders).</TE>
<TE>   "Dahmer" is at its best at its beginning. It re-creates the
notorious incident in which a drugged and injured Laotian youth (Dion
Basco), 14, managed to escape from Dahmer's apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Wandering the streets wearing only his undershorts and trying to
find help, he is spotted by two young women who try to help him. Two
police officers appear, followed by Dahmer, who smoothly convinces
them that the kid is merely drunk. The women disagree strongly, but
the dismissive officers view the incident as a gay lovers' spat.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobson stages this horrifying sequence without any heavy-handed
underlining. (Still, it would have said something of the world Dahmer
lived in had Jacobson included that after returning the youth to
Dahmer, the officers joked that they would have to go back to the
police station to get deloused.)</TE>
<TE>   The film continually shifts between past and present, not a bad
idea, except that the flashbacks sketchily suggest that Dahmer's
troubles began to surface when his upper-middle-class parents
divorced when he was 18 when they clearly started much earlier. The
film does not mention, for example, that he had a childhood history
of cruelty to animals.</TE>
<TE>   His mother, who remarried and moved to California, is a cipher
here, and his father (Bruce Davison), who subsequently wrote a book
trying to come to terms with his son's fate, comes across as
insensitive, authoritarian and slow to comprehend that his son is
seriously disturbed.</TE>
<TE>   The heart of the film is like a two-character play (unfolding in
an obvious set) involving Dahmer and one of his pickups, the slight,
charismatic Rodney (Artel Kayaru). Warm, outgoing, direct, funny and
endearing, Rodney is everything that the calculating, secretive
Jeffrey is not. Rodney manages to find something appealing in Dahmer,
even though he considers him weird.</TE>
<TE>   The trouble is that Rodney comes across as the fictionalized
character he is, and the culmination of this sequence is altogether
too contrived. The incident in which one of Dahmer's victims escaped
his clutches, thus bringing about his downfall, is not dramatized,
and why Dahmer zeroed in mainly on Asian, Hispanic and African men
remains unexplored.</TE>
<TE>   Wisely, Jacobson depicts only three of Dahmer's victims, including
his first, a high school wrestler (Matt Newton) he lures into his
mother's home while she is away.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobson is skilled with his small cast and mostly leaves to the
imagination the outcome of a number of gruesome sequences.
Ultimately, however, "Dahmer" suffers from a lack of clarity and
audacity that a subject as monstrous and pathetic as Dahmer demands.
Some bursts of energy and pitch-dark humor could have set off a more
revealing portrait of this serial killer.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for aberrant violence, sexuality, language and
some drug use. Times guidelines: The film is unsuitable for children.</TE>

<HD>'ZigZag' Veers Off in Surprising Directions</HD>
<DH>In his directorial debut, David S. Goyer coaxes wonderful
performances of challenging characters in a coming-of-age story.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"ZigZag" is a small movie with a big impact. It represents an astute
directorial debut for screenwriter David S. Goyer, who made his mark
with strong action-adventures, often comic-book-inspired, most
notably "Blade" and "Blade 2."</LD>
<LD>   Although a distinct departure from the thrillers he scripted,
"ZigZag" is anchored, as was "Blade 2," in a potent father-son
relationship. In the "Blade" films, it was between title character
Wesley Snipes and maverick scientist Kris Kristofferson. Here, it is
between Singer (John Leguizamo), a warehouse worker who has signed up
to be a big brother to ZigZag (Sam Jones III), a high-functioning
autistic 15-year-old with a drug-addicted single father (Snipes)
whose brutality tests his son's inner resources. Singer's struggle to
get ZigZag out of his terrible home environment has an urgency,
because Singer is suffering from terminal cancer.</LD>
<TE>   Just as the film, which Goyer adapted from the Landon J. Napoleon
novel, seems to be laying it on thick with the news of Singer's fatal
disease, "Zig" zags in an unexpected direction. ZigZag has an
after-school job as a dishwasher in one of those used-brick,
stained-glass and dark-paneling restaurants, the Grub 'n' Grog, owned
by the exuberantly bigoted and obnoxious Walters (Oliver Platt),
called "Toad" behind his back by his workers. Having been badly
treated by his father and then by Toad, ZigZag, who has a phenomenal
memory for numbers, impulsively spins the combination of the
restaurant safe and robs it of $9,000. Not knowing what to do with
the loot, ZigZag inadvertently allows his father to confiscate it.</TE>
<TE>   The story follows Singer's uphill struggle to return the money
before its theft ruins ZigZag's life. But once the film sets this
plot in motion, it refreshingly departs from its unraveling to create
a touching coming-of-age story filled with humor and suspense.
"ZigZag" is an urban fable made real by its beautifully written and
wonderfully well-played people. More than merely heart-tugging,
Singer's illness makes credible his withdrawal from all others in his
life in his single-minded concentration on securing Zigzag's future.</TE>
<TE>   Toad and Zigzag's dad, Fletcher, are dreadful men who enjoy making
life miserable for others, but Snipes and Platt, both resourceful
actors, find the humanity and even humor in these monsters. Natasha
Lyonne's Jenna could so easily have become yet another hooker with a
heart of gold, but her subtly shaded acting, supported by Goyer's
superior writing and direction, allows her to emerge as a streetwise,
no-nonsense woman whose innate intelligence preserves her humanity.
Luke Goss' loan shark-strip club proprietor is amusingly nasty, and
Sherman Augustus is a smart, low-key cop of unflagging persistence.</TE>
<TE>   These fine performances, including a sharp cameo by Elizabeth Pena
as ZigZag's teacher, provide splendid support for Jones and
Leguizamo's stellar portrayals of two loners of imagination and
sensitivity whose strong emotional bond develops in the face of
life's precariousness. Jones emerges as an actor of much promise, and
this arguably represents Leguizamo's finest screen acting to date.</TE>
<TE>   "ZigZag" is also richly cinematic. Los Angeles locales have been
chosen with a keen eye to freshness and pungent atmosphere, and they
have been masterfully photographed by James L. Carter with a notably
effective play of dark and light. With Carter and ace production
designer Philip Toolin's contributions, Goyer has been able to bring
to his film a lot of style amid authentically seedy settings. It is a
comment on the times that so successfully idiosyncratic a film bears
a 2000 copyright. That it has been on the shelf awhile is all the
more reason to be grateful for its release.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for strong language and sexual content, elements
of drugs and violence. Times guidelines: strong violence and
language; some nudity, sex and drugs.</TE>

<HD>NBC Diversity Unit Now in D.C.</HD>
<DH>Television* Network says the move from L.A. shouldn't
affect the office and its new director. Some observers aren't so
sure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Weeks after NBC's chairman and chief executive, Robert Wright, said
programs for viewers outside its "target" wealthy audience had not
scored high enough ratings to be profitable for the network, he has
reassigned the responsibilities of its chief of diversity to an
executive 3,000 miles from Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Jack was named this week to take the diversity duties
along with his appointment as president and general manager of
WRC-TV, NBC's Washington station.</LD>
<LD>   Wright told the Wall Street Journal four weeks ago that the
plethora of cable and broadcast networks provides "places you can go
with a pure ethnic show, and they don't have to be spectacular to
succeed. With us, they've got to be awfully good."</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for the network said Wright was referring to ratings
and not quality of the shows. But Sharon Johnson, chairwoman of the
Black Writers' Committee at the Writers Guild of America West, said
Wright's comments represent the backward culture of a network that
assigns "diversity chiefs" with no real power and then claims
diversity is a losing venture.</TE>
<TE>   "As if it's not about race, it's about economics," Johnson said.
"Treating people unjustly was about economics and always has been.
You're not getting away from the racial aspects by leaning on the
economic aspects."</TE>
<TE>   NBC received the highest "grade" of the major networks--C--13
months ago from a minority coalition evaluating their infusion of
diversity into the prime-time lineup. The lowest grade, D-, went to
ABC. The coalition includes the National Assn. for the Advancement of
Colored People, the National Latino Media Council, American Indians
in Film &amp; Television and the Asian Pacific American Media Coalition.</TE>
<TE>   "NBC's approach to diversity is ensemble casting," said Paula
Madison, the outgoing diversity chief who oversaw that progress at
NBC. "When people would cite 'Friends' or 'Frasier,' they came into
being before we understood that we wanted diversity in our
casting.... Now look at the diverse casts of 'Scrubs' and 'ER.' "</TE>
<TE>   NBC and the other major networks appointed diversity chiefs in
2000 in response to criticism that minorities were underrepresented
in prime-time programs.</TE>
<TE>   Madison's new job will be to focus on integrating the staffs and
mission of NBC with Telemundo, the second-largest Spanish-language
television network in the country, which NBC acquired last year for
$2.7 billion. She will also remain president and general manager of
KNBC-TV and will lead the entertainment team of the diversity
initiative at the network on a temporary basis, until her successor
gets up and running.</TE>
<TE>   Jack's work from an office in Washington does not sit well with
the Writers Guild's Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "How is someone going to tackle diversity if they're not here in
Los Angeles, where it's all happening? I'm not sure why he was
chosen," she said. "Maybe on the corporate level he is effective, but
we constantly ignore the creative level."</TE>
<TE>   Jack said Thursday he wasn't worried about being out of touch with
diversity issues in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "There's the wonder of telephones and planes," he said, mentioning
that the head of the Asian Pacific American Media Coalition, Karen
Narasaki, is based in Washington and already has had dinner with him.</TE>

<HD>Sounding Out More Complete Ratings</HD>
<DH>In a switch from written diaries, Portable People Meters
may offer a truer measure of tune-in, but the expense and accuracy
remain issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In George Orwell's "1984," Big Brother always knew what his
constituents were watching on television, because he was looking
through their screens and watching them. Now Arbitron, the radio
ratings service, wants to eavesdrop on what you're listening to.</LD>
<LD>   But the goal isn't world domination. Like anything to do with
ratings, it all comes down to money--a more accurate gauge of
listening habits, so stations know what to charge their advertisers.</LD>
<LD>   That increased accuracy is supposed to come from the service's new
Portable People Meters, which it has been testing in Philadelphia for
two years. But the new, pager-like devices are showing Arbitron and
station owners something they didn't know: a lot more people are
listening to radio than they realized.</LD>
<TE>   "Radio has always been looked at as a stepchild to TV," said Peter
Smyth, president and chief executive of Boston-based Greater Media
Inc., which owns four stations in Philadelphia that participated in
the test. "I think radio has always been under-measured."</TE>
<TE>   Currently, radio ratings are tallied from weekly diaries in which
volunteers write about their listening habits. In contrast, the
People Meters are worn all day, and a sensitive microphone picks up
encoded signals from any radio station, TV station, cable channel or
even Internet broadcast the wearer hears, recording the time and
duration that it's heard.</TE>
<TE>   "It is as passive as you can get. We designed it so the consumer
doesn't have to think about the record-keeping," said Thom Mocarsky,
Arbitron's vice president of communications. "Radio has been thumping
at us for years, 'Give us something better than the diary.' "</TE>
<TE>   He said diary respondents tended to round up or down when writing
listening times, "so there are sins of omission."</TE>
<TE>   "You're going to write down stations you listen to all the time,"
he said, but omit--intentionally or not--ones you only sample
occasionally, or are forced to hear because your carpool driver wants
it on, for instance. And the Philadelphia tests confirmed that
theory, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Diary keepers for the winter 2002 ratings--covering January,
February and March--showed only one radio station reaching as much as
20% of the listening audience in Philadelphia. But during a test in
April, the People Meters showed 15 stations hitting that mark.
According to the winter quarter ratings, the area's top-rated
station, adult contemporary WBEB-FM, reached 17% of the area's
audience. But the People Meters showed 51% of Philadelphia listeners
heard WBEB at some point during the month. The reach for Greater
Media's rock station WMMR-FM jumped from 10% to 30%, for example.</TE>
<TE>   Station owners have long argued they had more listeners than the
ratings indicated, their supposition based on the number of people
attending live remotes or station concerts, or registering online for
perks. Mocarsky said the People Meters are uncovering this phantom
audience. And if stations can prove they have more listeners, they
can charge more for advertising.</TE>
<TE>   But many broadcasters, even though they live and die by
incremental changes in their ratings numbers, are not yet ready to
embrace the new technology. They want more testing in other cities,
and more information about the system's accuracy and expense.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not trying to be obstructionist at all," Greater Media's
Smyth said. "I want all the bugs to be worked out in test markets
before this becomes the commerce of radio. What's the rush? There's a
lot of money at stake here."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, ad revenue totaled $18.4 billion, according to the
Radio Advertising Bureau, the industry's sales and marketing arm.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of nine major radio chains met Monday and laid out
their concerns about the People Meters, including the cost of
switching from diaries to meters, and how the system would account
for someone listening to the radio in the shower, for example, or on
headphones.</TE>
<TE>   Mocarsky said Arbitron wants to work with the industry but
stressed that the testing in Philadelphia isn't done yet. He added
that the new system will be expensive, for stations and Arbitron
alike. But the meters can also compile information about TV and cable
viewing, so Arbitron is trying to arrange a joint venture with
Nielsen Media Research, the television ratings company, to use the
meters to gather numbers for it too. Arbitron will save by splitting
costs with Nielsen, he said, and the service will cost less if radio,
TV and cable channels are all using it.</TE>
<TE>   He wouldn't comment, though, on how much the People Meters and the
10 years of research behind them are costing Arbitron.</TE>
<TE>   "Can radio afford a lot of meters by themselves? No. But if you
share with TV and cable, everybody is contributing to one sample,"
thus reducing the cost, Mocarsky said. In addition, that
consolidation means the sample can include more people, ostensibly
making it more accurate.</TE>
<TE>   If Arbitron and Nielsen embark on a joint venture, Mocarsky said
People Meters will start landing in a few other major markets next
year, and will be measuring the top 100 markets by 2008.</TE>
<TE>   The meter is a palm-sized, 2.6-ounce device, which, in addition to
the microphone, has a motion sensor, so Arbitron knows if it's being
used or not. The company pays volunteers about $20 to participate,
more or less depending on how much the device moves around. The
participant plugs the meter into a charger before going to bed, and
it calls Arbitron via modem in the middle of the night and downloads
the information from that day.</TE>
<TE>   But Mocarsky stressed the privacy of the system--personal
identifiers are never attached to the numbers, and information about
participants is "never, ever, ever, ever" sold to a third party. He
also said no one involved has yet expressed any "Big Brother"
misgivings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like we walked into the house and said, 'Put this on.'
They chose to take part. They're either in or they're out."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles station owner Saul Levine said he'll welcome the
meters. Levine, owner of the classical KMZT-FM (105.1) and adult
standards KSUR-AM (1260), believes the diary system has never
accurately measured his audience--older and more upscale than
average, and less willing to bother filling out the paperwork.</TE>
<TE>   "The Philadelphia survey, it measured older listening, older
persons listening, better than the diary method, and of course the
conglomerates wouldn't like that," he said. "They're based on their
stations having this youth appeal, big numbers, and that's what
they're getting the agencies to buy these days."</TE>
<TE>   He said the large radio chains manipulate Arbitron, counting on
listeners to procrastinate and fill out their diaries from memory at
the end of the week or month, and holding attention-grabbing contests
at those times.</TE>
<TE>   "What it really boils down to is, apparently the People Meter
would measure actual listening," Levine said, which is not what the
major chains want. "They like it the way it is, so they can have a
contest, give a car away on the day people are filling out their
diaries, and do anything they can except measure actual listening."</TE>
<TE>   But the program director at Power 106, L.A.'s No. 2 station in the
winter ratings, says he's "really optimistic" about the promise of
the People Meters.</TE>
<TE>   "The manually filled out diary system has been dated for some
time," said Jimmy Steal, program director of hip-hop KPWR-FM (105.9)
and regional vice president for Emmis, which also owns country
station KZLA-FM (93.9).</TE>
<TE>   "If the People Meter delivers higher accuracy, and it looks like
it does, I can't imagine broadcasters being afraid of that. Radio
will have a more compelling case for advertisers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "When it's electronic and automatic, it seems the downside is a
lot less than when we're relying on recall."</TE>

<HD>When the Big Cheeses Try Menial Jobs</HD>
<DH>'Back to the Floor' puts executives in the trenches for a
week. Although the shows offer lessons, the fun is in the turnabout.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unscripted shows offer vicarious thrills for varied tastes: You can
live the life of an aging rocker on "The Osbournes," woo singles on
"Temptation Island," bungee jump into a snake pit, or whatever, on
"Fear Factor."</LD>
<LD>   Now comes a fantasy for every disaffected workplace grunt. No, not
a 30% raise (get real), but a chance to see top executives descend
from the boardroom and head "Back to the Floor" to sweat alongside
the riffraff for a week.</LD>
<LD>   In tonight's two-episode premiere, the chief of the conservancy
that runs New York's Central Park dons gardening gear and picks up
trash, crack vials and an appreciation for the toiling her staff does
every day; then the boss of Burger King's British operations makes
Whoppers and quite a mess at the chain's central Liverpool
restaurant.</LD>
<TE>   Co-produced by Oregon Public Broadcasting and the BBC, "Back to
the Floor" is a six-part series airing during the next five weeks.
Future half-hour shows feature the chiefs of Carnival Cruises,
Heathrow Airport, a private prison company and a British pottery
factory.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of each program, the executives return to their
boardrooms with a better sense of how their company works, although
in some cases these lessons are almost as superfluous as Jerry
Springer's "final thought." The fun comes from watching the bigwigs
whine and bungle their way through the simplest tasks.</TE>
<TE>   Native New Yorker Regina Peruggi is a fund-raising whiz who works
on Fifth Avenue--what does she know from gardening? During her week
in uniform, she reports to work at 6:45 a.m. and helps pick up the 6
tons of trash that the park's gardeners must remove daily.</TE>
<TE>   She wonders why there aren't more coffee breaks and why the crews
don't have high-tech rock picker-uppers. Later she gripes about
having to swing a pickax to reseed lawns, scoffing at the "medieval"
tool.</TE>
<TE>   But Peruggi never loses her humor. Examining the blisters on her
hands, she figures she can use her work experience to raise money:
"I'm going to have to go out and show my hands, the calluses, and
say, 'See, we need your help.' "</TE>
<TE>   Fund-raising, which covers most of the park's budget, has been
tough in the wake of Sept. 11, but when layoffs become necessary,
Peruggi ultimately decides to trim managers rather than staff.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Bonnot, the polite Frenchman who runs Burger King U.K., has
trouble standing the heat at one of the chain's busiest franchises.</TE>
<TE>   When Bonnot arrives wearing a suit, tie and nervous smile, the
minimum-wage staff already is resentful at having to do extra
cleaning for his visit.</TE>
<TE>   One worker sneers, "I hope by the end of the week he's gone home
and he's absolutely knackered."</TE>
<TE>   On the job, Bonnot can barely open the cash register, and he
spills about a gallon of soda per drink order. The manager has to
remind him to smile and ask customers, "Do you want to go large?"</TE>
<TE>   Bonnot explains, "I can't get my feet, my hands, my brain and my
smile to all work at the same time."</TE>
<TE>   This episode illustrates how unscripted shows can alter reality.
An irritated worker complains about the "special treatment" Bonnot
gets in the form of extra coaching, as additional crew chiefs are
brought in during his shifts.</TE>
<TE>   Even back on the floor, some people are more equal than others.</TE>
<TE>   "Back to the Floor" premieres at 10 tonight on KCET. It is rated
TV-PG (may be unsuitable for young children).</TE>

<HD>New York Loses Some Starring Roles</HD>
<DH>Television* The number of programs shot in the Big Apple
has dropped abruptly. Post-Sept. 11 fallout? Or is it merely a
coincidence?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VERNE GAY</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Don Scardino is a highly regarded TV director and producer, and Glenn
Gordon Caron is one of TV's best-known creators. Besides TV, both
share something in common: an insistence on working in New York.</LD>
<LD>   Lately though, they've shared something else too: not working in
New York.</LD>
<LD>   This, they say, is by choice. Scardino, a co-executive producer of
"The Education of Max Bickford," says, "I'm trying not to book myself
up too much" because he's developing some features. Caron ("Now and
Again") plans to go to Los Angeles next month to pitch the networks
on new projects.</LD>
<TE>   Caron most recently produced a show for Fox, which never aired.
CBS pulled "Bickford" after one season. In New York's white-hot TV
production world of the past few years, another show would have
quickly replace those. But New York's TV production world isn't
white-hot anymore, and--depending on who's doing the talking--it has
either entered a deep freeze or a temporary lull. Caron and Scardino
subscribe to the "lull" theory.</TE>
<TE>   "The construction of new studio space makes me think it's a blip,"
says Scardino, referring to a spate of new or proposed studio space
around the city. Caron says, "I believe six months from now, a number
of shows will be shot in New York."</TE>
<TE>   Indisputably, New York television has hit a rough patch, and one
need look no further than the fall 2002 schedules to see how rough.
For the first time since the 1998 season, not a single new show
produced in one of the five boroughs will be on the fall lineups of
ABC, CBS, NBC or Fox. "Queens Supreme," a 12-episode midseason order
starring Oliver Platt for CBS, begins shooting in Queens next month.
After that, the networks have ordered nothing for the foreseeable
future.</TE>
<TE>   Reasons? That's the question of the moment in the $1.4-billion New
York TV industry, and everyone who writes a script or hauls equipment
or operates a camera has a theory.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people are trying to look for reasons, [but] I don't
think there is a reason," says Alan Suna, chief executive of
Silvercup, New York's biggest TV production facility, who adds that
TV "is a little off, not a lot off." He says, "I don't think there is
an anti-New York or Sept. 11 thing, as best as I can figure. It was
just the luck of the draw."</TE>
<TE>   Without question, luck has played a role in New York's current
fallow period. If shows such as "Bickford" or ABC's "The Job" had
good ratings last year, they'd be back. If NBC had fallen in love
with a new Chevy Chase sitcom, yet another New York show would be on
the fall lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "We lost two series and we got 'Queens,' " says Patricia Reed
Scott, commissioner of the Mayor's Office of Film, Theatre &amp;
Broadcasting. "You can't agonize over this. Shows drop off all the
time."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, two "Law &amp; Orders" (the mother show and "Criminal Intent")
are produced in Manhattan ("SVU" is shot partly in New Jersey, and
the series "Ed" entirely there). "The Sopranos" and "Sex and the
City" are resoundingly New York shows, while director Mike Nichols is
currently shooting "Angels in America" for HBO at Kaufman-Astoria
Studios in Queens. NBC's "Third Watch" remains a New York stalwart
too.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, some say New York's TV scene had a production version of
a "false-positive" in 2000-01, when shooting here surged because of
the fear of a writers' strike. When the threat of a strike waned, so
did production.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, most observers agree that money, and to a lesser
degree Sept. 11, have clouded New York production. Unless associated
with hits such as "ER," producers on both coasts are now routinely
told to bring an hour drama under budget, and New York remains
burdened with an impression that it is an expensive city.</TE>
<TE>   A show gets shot in New York because the city "is so organic" that
"no other city could potentially act as a double, or because the star
demands that it is in New York," says one studio executive. "This
year, for whatever reason, none of those situations happened."</TE>
<TE>   Verne Gay writes about television for Newsday, a Tribune company.</TE>

<HD>Trumpeter Harrell and Rich, Understated Emotion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is an inexorable sense of rightness in artistic expression--of
whatever genre--in the hands of a truly gifted artist. Think of Van
Gogh's sunflowers, a Mozart melody, a Gershwin phrase, and the
constant thought that comes to mind is, of course, how could it
possibly be done any other way?</LD>
<LD>   Trumpeter Tom Harrell's playing often tends to evoke a similar
reaction. Although he is fully in command of the technical
capabilities of both trumpet and fluegelhorn, he rarely relies upon
virtuosic note displays. Although he seems capable of doing so, he
seldom punches out top-of-the-horn high notes for their sheer
exhibitionistic value.</LD>
<LD>   What Harrell does do is spin out improvisational lines filled with
instant melodies. Like a lyricist who illuminates phrases with subtle
internal rhymes, Harrell's soloing captivates both the hearts and the
minds of his listeners.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday night at the Jazz Bakery, Harrell, leading a quintet
consisting of tenor saxophonist Jimmy Greene, pianist Xavier Davis,
bassist Ugonna Okegwo and drummer Quincy Davis, offered a collection
of music tailored for improvisational soloing and interaction, as
well as a sprinkling of selections from the carefully crafted but
vigorously swinging originals that represent yet another facet of his
many skills.</TE>
<TE>   Harrell, who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, presented--as
a side effect of his medication--a muted, seemingly detached onstage
appearance. At least when he wasn't playing, that is. But once he
placed his horn to his lips, the rich emotions and cool rationality
that lay behind his visible exterior came flowing out through his
music.</TE>
<TE>   Those qualities were apparent during a penetrating rendering of
the Matt Dennis standard, "Everything Happens to Me," accompanied
only by Davis' lush piano accompaniment. Never straying far from the
melody, Harrell's soloing had the understated layering of emotions
one associates with the finest jazz vocalists, shifting a phrase
here, adding a tiny enhancing flurry of notes there, constantly
reaching for the inner life of the song.</TE>
<TE>   Davis also contributed a series of sparkling solos of his own, and
Green's big, brash saxophone sound provided the perfect extroverted
counter for Harrell's inner searching. The always dependable Okegwo
and Davis laid down a solid foundation of rhythmic support.</TE>
<TE>   The Tom Harrell Quintet at the Jazz Bakery, 3233 Helms Ave., L.A.
Tonight through Sunday at 8 and 9:30 p.m. $25. (310) 271-9039.</TE>

<HD>Rubyhorse Is Looking for a Place to Fit In</HD>

<LD>Back in the '60s, British groups did us a service by bringing
American blues and rock back to their homeland. But is there any need
today to import American-sounding music in the vein of the
Wallflowers and Counting Crows?</LD>
<LD>   That seems to be the redundant mission of Rubyhorse, a band that
originated in Cork, Ireland, and resettled in Boston in 1998.
Wednesday at the Roxy--as on its recent major-label debut album,
"Rise"--the quintet showed a knack for the pleasing melodies,
middle-of-the-road rock and familiar emotional terrain of those U.S.
bands, but lacked their distinctive touches.</LD>
<LD>   Rubyhorse started its crisp, polished, 45-minute set evoking Irish
rock gods U2 and Scotland's Simple Minds on the electro-pulse-driven
"Evergreen." George Harrison was honored with a portion of "My Sweet
Lord" inserted in "Punchdrunk." The Rolling Stones were referenced
via a bit of "Satisfaction" shoehorned uncomfortably into "Into the
Lavender."</LD>
<TE>   The band is not without its presence and charm--singer Dave
Farrell seemed endearingly earnest, if not exceedingly charismatic.
Still, it's not enough to compensate for the trite lyrics and
undistinguished professionalism that mark most of the songs.</TE>
<TE>   Which isn't to say that the band won't ride its current single,
the uplifting if generic "Sparkle," to pop-chart success. There's
clearly a big market for this stuff, attested to by Train and
Matchbox Twenty. Should that happen, maybe the question of whether or
not the band is actually needed on these shores would be rendered
moot.</TE>
<TE>   But until then, it's worth posing.</TE>

<LD>So subtle, you won't recall</LD>
<LD>   watching it</LD>
<LD>   --A line (unquoted in ads) from</LD>
<TE>   a Howard Rosenberg review</TE>
<TE>   It's that time of year again.</TE>
<TE>   Emmy nominations will be announced July 18, as if readers of
Variety and other TV trade publications need to be told. Splashed
across their pages now are critics' blurbs ("Powerful!" "Brilliant!")
meant to sway Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences voters in ads
offering actors and shows "For Your Emmy Consideration."</TE>
<TE>   The Emmy spin arrives from many sources, including elderly civil
rights heroine Rosa Parks, who has picked this moment, surely at
someone's urging, to write an open letter to the TV academy saying
she's "honored and touched" by this year's CBS drama, "The Rosa Parks
Story."</TE>
<TE>   At a recent forum at the Getty Center, meanwhile, film critics
Richard Corliss of Time, Ella Taylor of L.A. Weekly and Kenneth Turan
of the Los Angeles Times were asked how they felt about being quoted
in ads. They were unimpressed.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other TV critics, I feel exactly the same way. In writing
columns and reviews, getting quoted is never my agenda. Nope, not on
my radar screen. No ego here. I have too much integrity for that. My
validation comes from within.</TE>
<TE>   Which I hope to make clear in this column.</TE>
<TE>   Now you take one of my TV favorites, "The Chris Isaak Show."
Although a small quote from me appears in an ad pitching this
Showtime comedy for an Emmy, looming above it is a monster blurb from
Matt Roush of TV Guide, printed in block letters up to 4 1/2 inches
high: "So COOL It Deserves to be Hot."</TE>
<TE>   Not that being overshadowed matters to me. Here's the irony,
though. When I initially screened "The Chris Isaak Show," my first
impression also was: SO COOL IT DESERVES TO BE HOT. No kidding. I
even said to my wife, "Honey, this show is SO COOL IT DESERVES TO BE
HOT." She begged me to include that in my review, predicting it would
be quoted everywhere. I refused, telling her I don't write with ads
in mind.</TE>
<TE>   I could have used in my review, also, a line from my notes--one
sure to have resonated, as well--calling Kristin Datillo's cheeky
performance as Isaak's manager A TRIUMPH OF THE HUMAN SPLEEN.</TE>
<TE>   And that Isaak's show was SO FUNNY, EVEN MY CATS LAUGHED.</TE>
<TE>   And that I LAUGHED SO HARD, I FELL FROM MY CHAIR, HIT MY HEAD AND
WAS RUSHED TO A HOSPITAL, WHICH REFUSED TO TREAT ME BECAUSE I'D
FORGOTTEN MY INSURANCE CARD.</TE>
<TE>   These were in my notes. But nix on printing them. Stooping that
low to achieve fame in an ad is against my nature.</TE>
<TE>   Take another of my favorite comedies, "Everyone Loves Raymond" on
CBS. I recall thinking when watching this series, NO ONE LOVES
RAYMOND AND HIS FAMILY MORE THAN I DO. An ad-perfect quote? You bet.
But I kept it out, integrity intervening once again.</TE>
<TE>   While screening "The Bernie Mac Show" on Fox, moreover, I said to
my wife, "BERNIE IS THE BIG MAC OF COMEDY." She pleaded with me to
write just that. Promote myself through inevitable exposure in an ad?
No way.</TE>
<TE>   Why, that would be as self-serving as writing, MY ENTHUSIASM FOR
LARRY DAVID CAN'T BE CURBED, just because of my zest for his series,
"Curb Your Enthusiasm," on HBO. It's true that when watching, I
LAUGHED SO HARD MY HAIRPIECE FELL OFF, I SWALLOWED MY DENTURES AND MY
NOSE RAN FOR DAYS.</TE>
<TE>   No way would I want that in an ad, though.</TE>
<TE>   And take another of my very favorite comedies. The day after
screening it, I said to my wife, "I SPENT LAST NIGHT WITH THE WOMEN
OF MY DREAMS, AND THE 'SEX AND THE CITY' WAS NEVER BETTER." Plus, I
had jotted in my notes, "SEX AND THE CITY": WAS IT AS GOOD FOR YOU AS
IT WAS FOR ME? Then I confessed to my wife: "MY LUST FOR 'SEX AND THE
CITY' IS NO ONE-NIGHT STAND."</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, she implored me to feature all of this prominently in a
column. Again showing restraint, I would have none of it.</TE>
<TE>   Another series I've come to adore is also on HBO. Flipping through
my notes, I see that I scribbled this: ON SUNDAY NIGHTS, MY FINAL
RESTING PLACE BECOMES "SIX FEET UNDER." I would have written that in
my review had I not recoiled from the prospect of it appearing in an
ad, possibly with my name attached to it.</TE>
<TE>   I'm hopelessly addicted to that show's entire cast, especially to
Frances Conroy as matriarch Ruth Fisher. Knowing I'd be quoted, I
could write that she's as MAGNETIC AS ANYTHING ATTACHED TO MY
REFRIGERATOR DOOR. But again, the glory of getting blurbed turns me
off. Of course I'd have been widely quoted, too, had I written this
about Albert Finney's Winston Churchill in "The Gathering Storm" on
HBO: I WAS SO RIVETED TO MY SET THAT I HAD TO BE DETACHED BY AN
ACETYLENE TORCH.</TE>
<TE>   While watching HBO's "Path to War," moreover, I remarked to my
wife that Michael Gambon's performance as LBJ had THE RICH, NUBBY
TEXTURE OF PSORIASIS. For days, she lobbied me to mention that in
print, knowing my blurb would make me the toast of the industry. Of
course, I said no, once more unwilling to bring attention to myself.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, I'D FIGHT A WAR TO GET "BAND OF BROTHERS" AN EMMY, but
saying that in print would be a cheap gambit to get quoted in future
HBO ads touting THE MINISERIES OF THIS MILLENNIUM. That's not what
I'm about.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is having ads in mind while thinking that Kim Dickens and
Harry Lennix gave SLEEPER PERFORMANCES OF THE SEASON on Showtime in
"Things Behind the Sun" and "Keep the Faith, Baby," respectively.</TE>
<TE>   And that in Showtime's "The Believer," RYAN GOSLING'S EXCEPTIONAL
ACTING MADE A BELIEVER OUT OF ME.</TE>
<TE>   I recorded in my notes, also, that on A&amp;E's canceled "100 Centre
Street," Alan Arkin and LaTanya Richardson each SOARS SO HIGH THAT I
GET A NOSEBLEED JUST FROM WATCHING. But printing that would have
broken my ban on catchy phrases designed for blurbs.</TE>
<TE>   Uh oh. As I'm wrapping this up, it occurs to me that I have made a
strategic mistake here, because my quotes in this column can now be
used in Emmy ads, and I'm helpless to stop it. Gosh, I feel terrible
about that. Well, too late now.</TE>
<TE>   It wouldn't be so bad, I guess, to have a quotable gimmick, one as
recognizable as "thumbs up/thumbs down," a signature that helped
Roger Ebert and the late Gene Siskel build their franchise. I can
envision my own customized version in an Emmy ad now.</TE>
<TE>   ONE FINGER UP.</TE>
<TE>   You're right. This concept is not cool enough ever to be hot.</TE>

<HD>With Duke, It's Better Late Than Ever</HD>
<DH>Jazz* A new three-CD set titled 'Live and Rare' is an
Ellington fan's gold mine that includes unreleased performances.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mention the words "big band" and "jazz" in the same sentence, and the
name Duke Ellington instantly springs to mind. A list of the
innovative, mostly African American composers who created the
instrumental collective that became such a vital entity in 20th
century American music includes numerous other artists--Fletcher
Henderson, Benny Carter, Sy Oliver, Edgar Sampson and Mary Lou
Williams among them.</LD>
<LD>   But at the end of the day, it all comes back to Ellington
and--after he became associated with the Duke in 1939--Billy
Strayhorn. As with Beethoven in the 19th century, the awareness of
Ellington's work powerfully affected every composer who followed.</LD>
<LD>   So it's hardly surprising that the combination of historical
importance and sheer musical appeal in the Duke's music has
stimulated every record company with any Ellingtonia in their vaults
to make it available to the public. One would assume that everything
imaginable had already been issued on CD. Not so.</LD>
<TE>   "Duke Ellington: Live and Rare" (Bluebird/RCA Records) is a
three-CD boxed set dedicated to Ellington material from the last
years of his life, from 1965 to 1973. The 70 tracks include 15
previously unreleased performances and 30 tracks appearing on CD for
the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Two complete albums are included: "The Duke at Tanglewood" (1965)
and "Eastbourne Performance" (1974), the last officially recorded
Ellington performance. Both have been available on CD only as part of
RCA's massive, 24-disc "Duke Ellington Centennial Edition."</TE>
<TE>   The Eastbourne tracks are supplemented with three Ellington piano
tracks from a 1965 Pittsburgh Jazz Piano Workshop, a piano duet (on
"House of Lords") with Earl Hines, and a three-tune solo piano
performance by Ellington at a 1968 Newport Jazz Festival promotional
party.</TE>
<TE>   The Boston Pops tracks, recorded with Arthur Fiedler at
Tanglewood, are enhanced by Ellington introductions to the selections
(via a promotional radio recording) never before released to the
public, as well as eight rehearsal takes, also previously
unavailable.</TE>
<TE>   The album's final CD is devoted to recordings and alternate takes
from 1969 sessions that produced material for several Reader's Digest
limited-edition LP sets. This collection--perhaps the last
significant Ellington efforts not yet available to the general
public--has been long sought after by Ellington fans. They will be
pleased to learn that the CD also includes alternate takes, as well
as a strikingly idiosyncratic vocal by Ellington on an alternative
version of "Moon Maiden."</TE>
<TE>   Why is all this Ellington material so important--even the material
from his final years, when other arrangers often provided the charts
for his orchestra? For good reason, primarily because they display
the extraordinary staying power of an approach to composition and
arranging that dates to the earliest years of the big jazz band.</TE>
<TE>   The orchestrations of Ellington (and Strayhorn) were written in a
style that was established early and maintained over the life of the
Ellington ensemble. Essentially, it meant that each instrumental part
was laid out with a specific player in mind. Even when personnel
changed--which happened at a glacial pace in the Ellington
aggregation, as opposed to most other big jazz bands--the replacement
players were expected to deliver their parts in a fashion similar to
the original player at that position. Eventually, the newer players
would, in turn, have music to play that was tailored to their unique
qualities.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, the orchestra's musical identity remained remarkably
consistent during the five decades or so of its existence under
Ellington, as well as the nearly three decades since his death. That
consistency of sound and timbre was present in material ranging from
such masterful creative efforts as "Black, Brown and Beige" to
pop-tune-oriented collections such as the Reader's Digest
tracks--even when the arrangements are provided by writers such as
Luther Henderson, Wild Bill Davis and others.</TE>
<TE>   As I have written so often about so many Ellington recordings,
here is yet another compilation that merits a place in anyone's
serious collection of jazz recordings.</TE>
<TE>   Roman Holiday: Giancarlo Schiaffini is not exactly a highly
visible figure in the jazz world--at least not in this country. But
the 60-year-old trombonist, tuba player and composer has been an
A-list player in the Italian music community since the '60s, moving
comfortably from the avant-garde of Berio, Ligeti and Stockhausen to
the equally edgy, envelope-stretching jazz of Rome's Instabile
Orchestra. Wednesday night, he makes his Los Angeles debut appearance
at the Italian Cultural Institute, performing his own work, "Rhapsody
for Billie."</TE>
<TE>   The hourlong multimedia effort, a tribute to Billie Holiday, will
be performed live by Schiaffini and vocalist Silvia Schiavoni with a
pre-recorded tape of supplementary sounds and music, and images based
on photographs of Holiday prepared and sequenced by Schiaffini's
daughter, Ilara. Schiaffini prefers to view the work as something
more than a tribute or a celebration.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried to touch her meaning of pain and joy," he says. "I chose
some of her most characteristic songs and rearranged and revised them
according to our sensibilities."</TE>
<TE>   Schiaffini and Schiavoni have worked before in similar areas,
blending voice and music, most recently on James Joyce's "The
Dubliners." In both cases, however, he has insisted on approaching
the texts as essentially new works.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to get exactly what each song means, individually, because
they're all different," he says. "Not to treat them as standard items
that are all done in the same way, but to change them, to transform
their patterns, to get into the individual personality of each.
Silvia added to that process by writing some text pieces to play in
her role as an actress--stream-of-consciousness sorts of things."</TE>
<TE>   Schiaffini's ability to create and present this sort of
imaginative composition underscores the fact that the jazz
avant-garde--largely moribund in this country for the past few
decades, although it's beginning to revive--has continued to play a
fundamental role in European music.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a much longer tradition of accepting this sort of
musics," Schiaffini says, "with its free expression, its
improvisation, and so forth, via our own classical avant-garde. But
we're very much aware of what American jazz artists bring to the
music. And I too find it strange that America doesn't always seem to
understand the real value of what it has produced."</TE>
<TE>   Giancarlo Schiaffini's "Rhapsody for Billie" at the Italian
Cultural Institute, 1023 Hilgard Avenue, Los Angeles. Wednesday, 7:30
p.m. The program is free, but reservations are required. Information:

<HD>A Walk in the Dark</HD>
<DH>Steven Spielberg gets all creepy in 'Minority Report,' but
Tom Cruise keeps things human</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It took paranoid visionary Philip K. Dick to do what Stanley Kubrick
could not: Get Steven Spielberg to fully cross over to the dark side.
The question now is, how happy are we to have him there?</LD>
<LD>   Spielberg's "Minority Report" is amplified from a Dick short story
by writers Scott Frank and Jon Cohen, and it stars Tom Cruise as a
man hunted by the futuristic anti-crime unit he once led. It finds
Hollywood's preeminent director more convincingly at home with
unapologetically bleak and unsettling material than he was with
Kubrick's "A.I." "I wanted to make the ugliest, dirtiest movie I have
ever made," Spielberg told cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, and
there's little doubt he's succeeded.</LD>
<LD>   In a macro sense, this is a good thing. "Minority Report" is full
of the pleasure this most proficient director feels in stretching
himself, in redeploying his formidable skills and avoiding, as many
directors have not, simply making the same film over and over.</LD>
<TE>   But the road to self-knowledge can be an uneven one, and as
impressive as this disturbing, even haunting film can be, it does not
feel all of a piece. If anything, "Minority Report" is trying to do
too much, trying to combine elements--philosophical, futuristic,
hard-boiled criminal--that haven't been made to completely cohere.
This is a film that gives us a lot to chew on, but not all of it has
been properly digested.</TE>
<TE>   What is best, and creepiest, about "Minority Report" comes from
Dick, brilliant at envisioning a future that's got us by the throat.
Dick is essential here even though (a) his original was not a novel
but a 31-page short story published in 1956 in a magazine called
Fantastic Universe and (b) what was retained is little more than a
core plot line (a system hunting one of its own) and single
speculative premise. But what a premise that was.</TE>
<TE>   Dick, whose fiction has been most prominently turned into "Total
Recall" and the landmark "Blade Runner," came up with the notion of a
system that harnessed the minds of a trio of psychics who visualized
murders before they happened to a police force that arrested
perpetrators before any crime was committed. With his gift for
wordplay ("replicant," the key "Blade Runner" word, was his), Dick
called the psychics "precogs" (from "precognition") and the system
itself Precrime.</TE>
<TE>   As greatly fleshed out by Frank and Cohen, the two-hour, 17-minute
"Minority Report" starts out with what is in effect a prologue that
shows how the Precrime system, run by Chief John Anderton (Cruise)
with a zeal that turns out to have distinctly personal underpinnings,
actually works in Washington, D.C., in the year 2054.</TE>
<TE>   When the precogs have their visions (filmed by effects house
Imaginary Forces, which did the memorable opening titles for
"Seven"), they are transferred to computerized images that the chief
physically orchestrates to look for clues as to geographic location
so he knows where to send his men. With crimes of passion, such as
the one that opens the film, the race to get to the scene before the
deed is done can be nerve-racking.</TE>
<TE>   Precrime has turned Washington, the only city that uses it, into
America's safest: There hasn't been a murder in the nation's capital
in six years. But now, on the eve of the system's greatest triumph, a
referendum on whether Precrime should go national, there are worries
that the government wants to take it away from Anderton and
Precrime's founder, Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow). In fact, slimy
Justice Department operative Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) seems to
have just such a scenario in mind.</TE>
<TE>   In Dick's story, the precogs, "gibbering, fumbling creatures, with
their enlarged heads and wasted bodies," were considerably stranger
than they are on film, where the comatose Art, Dash and Agatha lie
suspended in a liquid solution in a secure room called the Temple.
"It's better," someone says, "if you don't think of them as human."</TE>
<TE>   It's Agatha, a precog acting in a distinctly human way, that puts
"Minority Report's" plot into gear by grabbing Anderton, urgently
whispering, "Can you see?" and directing his attention to a precog
vision of a considerably older crime. Intrigued despite a warning
that "you dig up the past, all you get is dirty," Anderton starts to
investigate. Which is also when Precrime suddenly fingers him as a
murderer, claiming--and the system has never been wrong--that he will
kill a man he's never met or even heard of in exactly 36 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Anderton on the run, staying ahead of his pursuers while trying to
figure out if the method he's devoted himself to could be flawed,
takes up the bulk of "Minority Report." Like several of the film's
aspects, the thriller plot is involving but only up to a point.</TE>
<TE>   Working once again with cinematographer Kaminski and using a
special process to create flat, washed-out colors, Spielberg has
clearly enjoyed filming some of the creepier aspects of Anderton's
flight, like a meeting with rogue surgeon Dr. Solomon Eddie (Peter
Stormare) to get an identity change. But "Minority Report's" plot
finally suffers from a pair of extremes. Initially, it has a tendency
to be too intricate and difficult to follow. The film's closing
segment has the opposite feeling, going for the kind of conventional
tidying up that overcompensates for whatever confusion it caused
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The same dynamic is true with "Minority Report's" profusion of
futuristic gizmos, to a certain extent dreamed up by a team of deep
thinkers ("usually you see these guys on 'Nightline' talking to Ted
Koppel," Spielberg told Wired Magazine) the director installed in a
Santa Monica hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Some of these ideas, like personalized advertising that calls out
your name as you walk by, or identification by retina scan (hence
those creepy eyeball-scanning mechanical spiders seen in the coming
attractions) are intriguing. But often these futuristic devices
clutter things up, and some of the film's most elaborate stunts, some
involving jet-powered police squads, feel over-produced in a way that
detracts from "Minority Report's" best segments.</TE>
<TE>   Those would be Anderton's investigation of and involvement with
the precog world, which allows the film to speculate about such
issues as whether knowing the future allows you to change it.
"Minority Report" holds our attention most in its quietest moments,
when Anderton visits key precog researcher Iris Hineman (Lois Smith)
or, most grippingly, when he spends quality time with precog Agatha,
a role that gives actress Samantha Morton (Oscar-nominated for Woody
Allen's "Sweet and Lowdown") a chance to give a harrowing performance
that touches a raw emotional nerve.</TE>
<TE>   If Morton has the film's most memorable performance, a word must
be said for Cruise. Though his is the starring role, it is in some
ways a thankless one, needing him to be the tireless turbine that
powers this expensive cinematic machine and nothing more. It's not
the kind of work that wins awards, but without Cruise's intensity
almost willing our interest in Spielberg's unrelentingly dark world,
"Minority Report" wouldn't have nearly as much life as it does.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for violence, brief language, some sexuality
and drug content. Times guidelines: The violence is brief but fairly
gruesome; an overall dark, creepy mood would be frightening to
younger children.</TE>

<HD>The Guru Came From Harvard</HD>
<DH>'Ram Dass: Fierce Grace' traces the life's journey of the
professor who became a noted spiritual leader with a legion of
followers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mickey Lemle's "Ram Dass: Fierce Grace," an ingratiating and
comprehensive portrait of the widely admired spiritual leader, author
and lecturer, takes its subtitle from Lemle's description of how the
subject of his documentary is coping with the effects of a stroke
that felled him more than five years ago, leaving him partially
paralyzed and with speech aphasia. The opening section shows Ram Dass
going through endless rehabilitation therapy, which he sees as an
opportunity for spiritual growth and a metaphor for the challenge of
aging.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, this splendid film culminates with the publication, in May
2000, of Ram Dass' latest book, "Still Here: Embracing Aging,
Changing and Dying," intended to make the aging process less
frightening for his readers. Ram Dass comes across as a warm,
profoundly spiritual man who has turned adversity into a way of
strengthening of his communication with others.</LD>
<LD>   Once Lemle acquaints us with Ram Dass' current everyday life, he
flashes back to show us how Richard Alpert, the youngest son of the
president of the New York and New Haven Railroad, a founder of
Brandeis University and one of Boston's preeminent attorneys, became
a respected Harvard psychologist. He was fired by the university in
1963 after another professor, Timothy Leary, was assigned to the
office next door and turned him on to the new world of psychedelic
drugs.</LD>
<TE>   For Alpert, dropping acid was a transforming religious experience.
But as it became less satisfying, he decided to travel to India,
where his guru, Neem Karoli Baba, known as Maharaj ji, convinced him
that he could expand his consciousness from within without recourse
to drugs. He also gave him his new name, Ram (Love) and Dass
(Servant).</TE>
<TE>   In regard to psychedelics, Ram Dass' longtime colleague Dr. Larry
Brilliant says that it is important to acknowledge that "a lot of
very good friends died from a lot of bad drugs."</TE>
<TE>   That Ram Dass pursued a path of spiritual enlightenment not
dependent upon LSD surely has contributed to his becoming such an
enduring and influential figure, even if Lemle doesn't come right out
and say so. In any event, "Be Here Now," an account of his journey
into consciousness-expanding published in 1971, is now in its 39th
printing.</TE>
<TE>   If Ram Dass seems a selfless, admirable man with a remarkable,
conscientiously developed gift for empathizing with others, he also
clearly has been fortunate. Just as he has the wherewithal to marshal
an army of experts in his rehabilitation from his stroke, he is also
lucky that he was born into a loving, supportive family. Not only was
his father, dressed in a homburg and a Chesterfield coat, able to
greet with equanimity his son on his return from India (the son
wearing only a sheet and long beard; no shoes), he was able to open
up his vast New Hampshire country estate to his son's followers.</TE>
<TE>   In archival footage, Ram Dass' father is shown looking out over
his lawns covered with hippies chanting "Hare Krishna" and dancing in
circles. He pronounces his son's work "wonderful" and expresses his
gratitude in being able to make his own small contribution by opening
his gates. His father is but one of the legions of admirers Ram Dass
has attracted to this day. And by the time this inspiring film is
over, Ram Dass is able to say that his stroke has caused him to grow
in ways that he might not otherwise have experienced.</TE>

<HD>This Is Certainly Better Than Repairing Typewriters</HD>
<DH>Movies* Bill Cobbs, co-starring in 'Sunshine State,' has
taken odd jobs and some roles for money. This isn't one of them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Cobbs divides his acting gigs into two categories: the jobs he
takes out of necessity to make a living and those that are labors of
love. "It is almost like going to work for an artist or going to work
for a businessman," says Cobbs, who has appeared in more than 60
movies, including Jennifer Lopez's latest, "Enough," and countless TV
series.</LD>
<LD>   Although Cobbs, 67, is too diplomatic to mention the projects he
took out of economic necessity, he's quick to point out that his
latest film, "Sunshine State," which opens today, was an artistic
endeavor.</LD>
<LD>   In John Sayles' sprawling ensemble drama, set in Florida, Cobbs
plays Dr. Lloyd, a pillar of the dying African American community of
Lincoln Beach who is trying to stop white investors from buying up
homes and property.</LD>
<TE>   The drama also stars Angela Bassett, Mary Alice, James McDaniel,
Edie Falco, Ralph Waite, Jane Alexander, Timothy Hutton and Mary
Steenburgen.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a wonderful experience," says the lanky and
distinguished-looking actor during a recent interview. "When John
Sayles picks you to do something, he really trusts you to do it.
Also, he has a good idea of what he wants so you don't find yourself
doing things over and over again."</TE>
<TE>   "Sunshine State" marks the second time Cobbs has worked with the
independent filmmaker. Eighteen years ago, he appeared in "Brother
From Another Planet" as a neighborhood philosopher named Walter.
Although Sayles didn't write Dr. Lloyd specifically for Cobbs, the
director says the idea of using the easygoing actor came to him once
he finished the script.</TE>
<TE>   Cobbs always has been impressed with how well Sayles understands
the machinations of other groups such as African Americans in
"Sunshine State," "Brother From Another Planet," and "Passion Fish"
(1992), and Latinos in "Lone Star" (1996) and "Men With Guns" (1997).</TE>
<TE>   "He has lived with people of all races, and because he understands
their dialogue, when he writes dialogue, I don't have any trouble
saying it," Cobbs says. "Not that many white people can do that. It's
not a put-down, it is just the way it is. He has this incredible
respect for other people that he takes the time to learn about them.
The characters are very true to life."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Lloyd is a stalwart defender of the legacy of Lincoln Beach
and regrets changes in the community brought about with the end of
segregation. When black professionals and businessmen were allowed to
integrate into previously segregated communities, Dr. Lloyd tells a
former resident (Bassett), they left the enclave and took the
community's livelihood and respect with them.</TE>
<TE>   What happened in the fictitious Lincoln Beach, says Cobbs, has
happened to many African American communities. "We were forced into
the environment, we made it special for ourselves and we had a good
deal of pride," says Cobbs. "As kids, we grew up with professional
people. We grew up with doctors and lawyers and people who owned
their own business. So as kids we were influenced by that.... Now
that is lost because the powerful people moved away. Outside
influences come in and bully people and essentially take away what we
had."</TE>
<TE>   For Sayles, Cobbs' great strength as an actor is that once he gets
into character, he stays there. "So no matter what he does--and each
time it is a little different--it is something you feel that the
character might do," Sayles says. "I think he just brings a lot of
wit and intelligence to it, whatever he is given to do."</TE>
<TE>   Cobbs was very popular with the cast and crew of "Sunshine State,"
which was shot on an island off Florida. "I think Bill is such a
personable guy," Sayles says. "He can live in a place for a weekend
and he's going to know 20 people. He'll kind of close the local joint
down."</TE>
<TE>   Started Acting at 36</TE>
<TE>   During the past 30 years, Cobbs has developed into one of the
busiest working actors in Hollywood. Among his film credits: "Random
Hearts" (1999), "Air Bud" (1997), "Ghosts of Mississippi" (1996),
"That Thing You Do!" (1996), "The Hudsucker Proxy" (1994), "The
Bodyguard" (1992), "The Color of Money" (1986) and "The Cotton Club"
(1984).</TE>
<TE>   Although Cobbs acknowledges that he's not a household name,
"people have seen my face" and always approach him on the street.
"Very often, they don't know how they know me," he says. "Many people
think I have gone to school with them. I have had people think I am
related to them."</TE>
<TE>   The Cleveland native didn't start his life as a professional actor
until he was 36. When he graduated from high school, he joined the
Air Force and worked for eight years repairing radar equipment.
During that time, he tried to do stand-up comedy on an amateur basis.
"I tried singing," he recalls, with a laugh. "I tried playing a
musical instrument. I really wanted to be a musician but I never
could quite pull that off. I liked entertaining, but I was always
drawn to some kind of technical work--some kind of honest labor."</TE>
<TE>   When he moved back to Cleveland after his stint in the Air Force,
Cobbs got a job with IBM as a customer engineer. He admits that
customer engineer was just a fancy word for an electric typewriter
repairman. "I wanted to be a salesman but I couldn't sell for them
because I didn't have a college degree."</TE>
<TE>   He didn't need a college diploma to sell cars, so he started
working at a local Chevy dealer. One day, a poet came in to look at
cars. The two became friends and the poet invited him to attend a
reading of his work at Cleveland's Karamu House Theatre. The
experience was so exhilarating for Cobbs, he soon tried his hand at
acting, although his early attempts were something of a bust.</TE>
<TE>   Newfound Confidence</TE>
<TE>   He was more successful in 1969 doing a reading of Kurt Weill's
"Lost in the Stars" at Karamu. "The play only lasted for three days,
but this experience was so totally different than the one I had
before," Cobbs says. "I had so much fun and all of these beautiful
young ladies were in the cast."</TE>
<TE>   With newfound confidence, Cobbs auditioned at Karamu for the Ossie
Davis comedy "Purlie Victorious" and, much to his delight, was cast
as the lead. Having caught the acting bug, he quit his job in 1970
and drove his Chevy to New York. Within a few months of moving there,
he was accepted for acting class at the Negro Ensemble Company and
was cast in his first professional theater job in the company's
production of "Ride a Black Horse."</TE>
<TE>   He made his film debut in "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three"
(1974) and two years later made his first TV appearance, in
"Vegetable Soup," a New York public television educational series for
children. During the lean times, he did what all struggling actors
do--he took any odd job to make ends meet. "I drove a cab," Cobbs
says. "One time I had a job repairing office equipment." He even
lived in his Chevy a few times. Still, he says, "it was the most
exciting time of my life. There were periods when I was flat broke,
but those were the happiest days of my life.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess it was a time when materially I had nothing, but
spiritually I had everything."</TE>

<HD>Actor Puts Words in Others' Mouths</HD>
<DH>Theater* To learn to type, Daniel Stern pecked out a play
that's now playing Philly. He enjoyed it so much he's writing
another.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE LUCEY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Named for a superstar diva and written by a movie comic, "Barbra's
Wedding" is a true study in celebrity.</LD>
<LD>   It is the playwrighting debut of Daniel Stern, who has appeared in
movies such as "Home Alone" and "Diner." The comedy, about an
unemployed actor struggling with his mediocrity in Hollywood as
Barbra Streisand's wedding to James Brolin takes place, premiered
this month at the Philadelphia Theatre Company.</LD>
<LD>   Stern, 44, who has worked as an actor since he first appeared in
the 1979 movie "Breaking Away," said the play is based largely on his
experiences.</LD>
<TE>   "When you see the play, it's the darkest recesses of an actor's
mind, how celebrity and all that can mess with your head and you lose
sight of what's important," he said. "I hate to admit this because
the character is so pathetic, but there are definitely thought
patterns that are my own."</TE>
<TE>   The main character, Jerry Schiff, is the former fourth lead in a
long-dead sitcom called "Everybody's Peachy." Played by John Pankow
(TV's "Mad About You"), Schiff is still hoping, despite obviously bad
odds, that he can get a comeback role or at least an "Everybody's
Peachy" reunion special.</TE>
<TE>   His exasperated wife, Molly, played by Julie White ("Six Feet
Under"), spends most of the play trying to snap him out of it.</TE>
<TE>   The play received only a lukewarm response from critics.</TE>
<TE>   Desmond Ryan of the Philadelphia Inquirer said it was a
"promising, if uneven" debut. He said the comedy was a good first
effort, with moments that are funny and insightful about celebrity,
but at times it was predictable and one-note.</TE>
<TE>   Stern said one of the reasons he started writing was to escape
stardom. He had appeared in dozens of films and was the voice of the
adult Kevin Arnold on "The Wonder Years." But after several big hits
in the 1990s, including "Home Alone" and "City Slickers," he said he
became too well-known.</TE>
<TE>   "It was too much public stuff.... I'd never been so recognizable,"
the gangly, nasal-voiced actor said. "I've always been a nice side
character actor, and suddenly I was front and center."</TE>
<TE>   So about five years ago he decided to slow down and spend more
time with his family. During that period, he said, he started to
write.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to teach myself to type," he said. "And I thought,
this is really boring, so I started to write things."</TE>
<TE>   Stern, who lives near Streisand in Malibu, said "Barbra's Wedding"
was inspired by the circus he saw on her wedding day.</TE>
<TE>   "I live near enough that with the helicopters I was like, 'What is
going on?' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the wedding is just a backdrop for the real action.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really an examination of a marriage of this couple," he
said. "Their marriage is at a critical point. It's watching them work
through their things. The wedding next door is a catalyst for that."</TE>
<TE>   And in some ways, Stern said, the play is a thank-you to his wife
for putting up with his career for more than 20 years. She has dealt
with "the roller coaster of being in show business and the toll it
takes on your life," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Barbra's Wedding" will finish its monthlong Philadelphia run June
30. Prospects for a New York or Los Angeles staging are uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   Stern said he has enjoyed the experience and is already working on
another play. "It's just having a creative outlet that doesn't
require anybody else," he said.</TE>

<HD>It's Still Oddly Familiar</HD>
<DH>Neil Simon brings back "Oscar and Felix" with a few updates
and a lot of fussy details, but much remains the same.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the cigar smoke wafts over the poker game, and the guys crack wise
in Oscar Madison's New York City apartment in Act 1 of "Oscar and
Felix, a New Look at the Odd Couple" at the Geffen Playhouse, we wait
and wait and wait to hear what is, in fact, new and, therefore,
noteworthy, about Neil Simon's latest rewrite of his wonderful 1965
comedy.</LD>
<LD>   The short answer: very little. In this version, Felix's marriage
has lasted eight years instead of 12. A sandwich that Felix makes for
blue-collar Vinnie has changed from a BLT on pumpernickel to a bacon
and Bearnaise. Oscar has a cell phone. There's talk of kids
fornicating in libraries. (Those kids today!)</LD>
<LD>   But the chief and unavoidable dramatic question raised by this
production is, alas, what's the point? If it sounds ungracious to
question the motives of a playwright who has given us more than his
fair share of laughter and entertainment in more than 30 plays, it
would be misleading to raise the expectation that he has reinvented a
past hit such that it shines more brightly than ever, or much at all.</LD>
<TE>   Quite the contrary, he has only made the old "Odd Couple,"
familiar to audiences from the movie starring Walter Matthau and Jack
Lemmon and the television series starring Jack Klugman and Tony
Randall, look better by comparison--much as he did when he altered
the play's gender in 1985, turning Oscar and Felix into Olive and
Florence. Which was an even worse idea.</TE>
<TE>   In "Oscar and Felix," directed by Peter Bonerz, the poker game
gags are still here, plus some new ones, and the evening is not
without bits of amusement built on his original idea of a slobby
sportswriter badly co-habiting with a fastidious male pal. But the
effect of updating his original 1960s scenario with references to the
Food Network and e-mail, while adding a Freudian explanation for
Felix's cleanliness malaise, is forced, labored and unworthy of
Simon's talent.</TE>
<TE>   It's too bad, because Simon has shown Los Angeles audiences in the
last decade that he is not written out, based on his hilarious homage
to the days of writing for live television in "Laughter on the 23rd
Floor" staged at the Doolittle in 1995 and the poignant "Proposals,"
staged by Joe Mantello at the Ahmanson in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The 2002 incarnation of Oscar is John Larroquette, a funny man in
other settings who works all too hard to find the gruffness and
rancor necessary to give Oscar's acerbic jousts their full thrust.
With his Mets cap on backward, his jowls asunder and his long legs
splayed as he shuffles around the apartment, Larroquette reminds us
of who Oscar used to be without making us believe he is Oscar. He
uses a similar slumped-back body language that Matthau made
synonymous with the role, but watching him in Act 1 we wonder what is
missing until it suddenly occurs that Larroquette is just too nice.
There's something warm in his eyes and his smile that take the bite
out of Oscar's tooth-baring retorts. Larroquette gets steamed when
Joe Regalbuto, as Felix, dashes his desperate desire for a fling with
one of the babes upstairs, but you never feel that he he's going to
hold a grudge, not to mention maybe have Felix murdered.</TE>
<TE>   Regalbuto, best known for his long-running role as Frank Fontana
on "Murphy Brown," has more success with Felix, the head case whose
wife has finally had enough and tossed him out, into the odd coupling
with his poker buddy Oscar. Maybe it was always hard to figure how
Felix ever fit into Oscar's circle of blue-collar poker pals, but
Simon has only stretched the credibility, emphasizing Felix's fragile
psyche with the revelation that his mother dragged him through the
house under her arm while she vacuumed and cut his toenails when he
was asleep. This, I think, qualifies as more than we want to know
about Felix, who was a perfectly fine comic creation the first time
around without the benefit of dramatic psychoanalysis.</TE>
<TE>   Maintaining Felix's tightly drawn sense of decorum, Regalbuto
weeps and whines convincingly at the thought of never seeing his kids
again, ultimately winning the sympathy of the sisters upstairs (not
much has changed about that). Safe to say Felix is an extreme
personality, and Regalbuto is up to the task of taking full measure
of that extremity without pushing him into caricature.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing that's changed about the sisters upstairs is that
they are now Spanish babes, instead of British--Ynes and Julia
instead of Gwendolyn and Cecily, and played by Maria Conchita Alonso
and Alex Meneses. They work for Iberia Airlines, and their incomplete
command of English allows for a number of malapropisms and cheap
mispronunciation jokes. That said, it must be added that
Larroquette's best and most original moment comes while explaining to
Felix how to pronounce the sister's Spanish names, requiring a
theatrical demonstration of tongue control that proves a small tour
de force.</TE>
<TE>   Alonso and Meneses are effective in what are, indeed caricatures
of a Spanish divorcee and widow, and the remainder of the veteran
supporting cast making up Oscar's weekly poker game--Richard Portnow,
Samuel Lloyd Jr., Gregory Jbara and Ryan Cutrona--all work well
together filling in the comic background of the Oscar and Felix
story. They can't be blamed for the new lines that fall flat ("Where
does he get the Bearnaise sauce?" "He wakes up early and kills a
Bearnaise.") and they make some of the old ones fly.</TE>
<TE>   "The Odd Couple" remains a very funny idea for a play as it was
written 40-some years ago, and the only conceivable reason to
redecorate it is to keep in step with the marketing imperative
dictating that everything must be made to look new for the latest
generation of consumers. But it's not so easy to take the fins off a
1960s Chevy, add tinted glass and expect it to look like a Saab.
Maybe it was better as a Chevy. In the same way, a fully realized
revival of "The Odd Couple" would be preferable to this "modern"
version that looks merely as if it were rushed through a paint and
body shop.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's not the first writer to want to improve on an earlier work
or revisit a piece that holds a particular fascination or fond
memory. But for his audience, the memory alone is probably good
enough.</TE>

<LD>   Hearing-Impaired Win Round in ABC Suit</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals has reinstated a lawsuit
charging that ABC discriminates against disabled people who want to
become contestants on "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," the game show
hosted by Regis Philbin.</TE>
<TE>   A three-judge panel reversed last year's decision by a Miami
District Court judge, who contended that the Americans With
Disabilities Act wasn't broad enough to cover the show's qualifying
system, which uses touch-tone phones. He has been ordered to review
that decision.</TE>
<TE>   Disability advocates say that live operators should be used, or
some other system to give the hearing-impaired a shot at the big
prize money. The act permits people to sue for better access and
legal fees, but not for compensation or damages.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to alter or make changes in the show, but we want
to make it fair," said Michael Lanham, the lawyer for Miami's Center
for Independent Living, which filed suit against the network and the
show's producers two years ago. "All we want is for reasonable
accommodations to be made."</TE>
<TE>   ABC spokeswoman Julie Hoover said the ruling was decided on a
"narrow legal basis.... We are confident that in the end, the
litigation will show that our practices comply fully with all
applicable laws."</TE>
<TE>   "Millionaire" is not on ABC's fall schedule but is expected to pop
up periodically. A syndicated version is due to debut in September.</TE>
<TE>   Manson Fined in Assault and Battery Case</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shock rocker Marilyn Manson, charged with sexual misconduct for
allegedly gyrating against a security guard at a Michigan concert,
has pleaded no contest to being a disorderly person and to assault
and battery.</TE>
<TE>   Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, was ordered to pay fines
and costs totaling $4,000. A no-contest plea is not an admission of
guilt.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiff, Joshua Keasler, also has filed a federal lawsuit
against the 33-year-old rocker, accusing him of sexual assault and
intentional infliction of emotional distress. After the hearing in
Michigan, Manson was notified a civil suit filed in New York state
court by a security guard accusing him of similar behavior at an Aug.
9 concert on Long Island.</TE>
<TE>   Duo Behind 'Star Wars' Reels to Be Sentenced</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sentencing has been set for next month for two Canadian men who
pleaded no contest to charges stemming from their efforts to sell
reels of "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones" for $3,000 on
the EBay Internet auction site, according to the Wayne County
prosecutor's office in Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   Amer Khawaj, 21, and Inderpreet Grewal, 20, pleaded no contest to
receiving and concealing stolen property.</TE>

<TE>   Gay Parenting Debate Fuels Nick Ratings</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Controversy surrounding Nickelodeon's "Nick News" program on gay
parenting Tuesday night propelled the show to its highest viewership
in three years, with an audience of 1.6 million people.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives for the children's cable channel said Nickelodeon
received some 700 e-mails from individual viewers who, after
watching, approved of the program. It also received a small number of
negative responses, they said.</TE>
<TE>   But the network said the organized campaign against the show, led
by the Traditional Values Coalition, continues to generate a
substantial number of form-letter complaints, in addition to the
100,000 negative e-mails, calls and petition signatures the network
estimates it received in the six weeks before the show's airing. The
coalition and other critics said the program, led by host Linda
Ellerbee, had a pro-homosexual bias.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MUSIC</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Professional Musicians Aren't Immune</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More than three-quarters of all professional musicians have
suffered injuries disabling enough to require time off from work,
according to a new book by Janet Horvath, associate principal cello
of the Minnesota Orchestra since 1980.</TE>
<TE>   During one two-minute aria in Handel's "Messiah," Horvath notes in
"Playing (less) Hurt: An Injury Prevention Guide for Musicians," she
bows 740 times. Multiply that through the rehearsal and concert
schedule and she figures the tendons slide 108,000 times--twice as
often as a 60-word-a-minute typist.</TE>
<TE>   And the situation is getting worse, she maintains.</TE>
<TE>   "I have seen a huge jump in injuries in young people," Horvath
told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. "... The 12- and 13-year-old
prodigy playing Tchaikovsky violin concertos is more the norm today.
I'm wondering at what cost. Often bones and muscles don't grow at the
same rate in a child. It's a formula for trouble if parents and
teachers are not really vigilant."</TE>
<TE>   The solution? Warming up, cooling down and taking frequent breaks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vanna White has filed for divorce from George Santo Pietro, her
husband of 10 years.... Three landscape watercolors by Prince Charles
sold for about $10,000 each at auction Tuesday.... "Night Divides the
Day," a tribute to the Doors by New Age musician George Winston, will
be released by RCA Victor in October....The documentary "Amandla!: A
Revolution in Four Part Harmony" has been picked up for theatrical
release by Artisan Pictures. It tracks the role of music in the
anti-apartheid struggle.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The photographs on view in Reagan Louie's current exhibition at
Gallery Luisotti represent a six-year documentary journey through the
underworld of the Asian sex industry.</LD>
<LD>   A Chinese American photographer whose last series (10 years in the
making) was an epic exploration of his ancestral homeland, Louie
covered nearly a dozen countries for this project, encountering
hundreds of women and girls in nearly every conceivable level of the
trade. (Men appear only occasionally, primarily as clients.) It is a
fascinating body of work.</LD>
<LD>   Louie's style is frank but thoughtful, and the landscape through
which he leads the viewer--one that few ever see--is intrinsically,
if uncomfortably, enthralling. It is also a subject strewn with
ethical land mines. The camera is never a neutral observer when it
comes to the commerce of women's bodies, even when it belongs to a
well-meaning documentarian rather than a pornographer.</LD>
<TE>   There are several instances in which Louie appears to be standing
alongside one of the latter, photographing women as they are being
photographed, and one must acknowledge that the effect is essentially
the same: an erotic body is an erotic body, in whatever context it
appears.</TE>
<TE>   Considering the youth and presumably low economic status of most
of these women, it would be a shame to see this eroticism exploited
in the name of art.</TE>
<TE>   The most impressive thing about the work, therefore, is not that
it piques one's curiosity, but that it ultimately constructs such a
nuanced and well-rounded portrayal.</TE>
<TE>   Louie's approach is neither sensational nor moralistic, neither
judgmental nor voyeuristic. Rather, he treats his subjects as he
would probably treat workers in any other industry.</TE>
<TE>   In some images, the women are sexy, showy, alluring or playful; in
others they're bored or indifferent. In some, they're entertaining
men or giving massages (there is no explicit sexual activity), but in
many others, they're checking their beepers, eating takeout or just
sitting around. In a large percentage of the pictures, in fact, they
hardly look like sex workers.</TE>
<TE>   There is certainly tragedy in this world--most of the women are
shockingly young, for example--and Louie doesn't attempt to elide it.
Nor does he depersonalize that tragedy with sentimental propriety.</TE>
<TE>   The selection of works included here is commendably balanced and
manages to carry the significant complexity of the project despite
the relatively small scale of the venue. Still, one can't help but
wonder about the hundreds of images that must have been cut in the
selection process and the many more stories they contain.</TE>

<TE>   Paintings That Force Us to Examine Our Conscience</TE>
<TE>   In a statement on his current body of work, Ruprecht von Kaufmann
includes a quotation by German writer Martin Walser: "A dream that's
forced into the light of a different language will only reveal what
we ask. Like a tortured man, it will say anything we want it to say.
So does the past."</TE>
<TE>   The German-born, Art Center-trained Von Kaufmann tests Walser's
theory--challenging viewers to interrogate the past--in an unusual
series of historical portraits that makes up about half of the
exhibition. His subjects are notorious figures, all of whom are
responsible for large quantities of death and destruction in the
service of a political or religious ideal.</TE>
<TE>   Among them are some of the usual suspects, such as Joseph Stalin
and Pol Pot, as well as less familiar ones, like Jean Kambanda, the
prime minister of Rwanda during the Hutu slaughter of Tutsi refugees
in 1994, and Carl Clauberg, a Nazi gynecologist who spent much of
WWII conducting gruesome experiments in concentration camps in search
of "cheap and efficient" methods for mass sterilization.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than granting these figures their standard historical
regalia, however, Von Kaufmann portrays each in a particularly
vulnerable (albeit imaginary) situation: in utero.</TE>
<TE>   Each of these visually striking paintings is a diptych: on the
left, a fetus floats in a painterly swirl of soft, eerily illuminated
color; on the right, a portion of the fetus' skeleton appears as a
realistically rendered electric-blue X-ray. Laying commonly held
notions of evil across the archetypal icon of innocence, then
subjecting that icon to a pseudoscientific mode of examination, Von
Kaufmann seems to be demanding from the past a new response--an
explanation that more adequately accounts for the persistent
phenomenon of atrocity--as well as challenging viewers to interrogate
their own assumptions.</TE>
<TE>   Also included in the exhibition are four large paintings depicting
dozens of nude figures crammed closely together, as though in a
subway car or other tight container, and pressed forward against the
surface of the canvas, which Von Kaufmann has painted to resemble a
wall of glass.</TE>
<TE>   Very subtle reflections, masterfully conveyed across the
paintings' surfaces, suggest another world on our side of that wall,
populated with faintly glimpsed onlookers much like us. Although
somewhat less pointed than the smaller paintings--the people trapped
in these works are nameless, their predicament enigmatic and our
position ambiguous--they're equally unsettling in their demands on
our conscience.</TE>

<TE>   Self-Portraits Reveal</TE>
<TE>   the Mind's Workings</TE>
<TE>   Daniela Steinfeld's photographs read like self-portraits turned
inside out. Although photographically objective--each image is a
straightforward, unaltered depiction of Steinfeld, posing in a plain,
white-walled studio--the works present an array of subjective states
enacted prosthetically on the surface of the body with only a few
simple props.</TE>
<TE>   In several, the German-based artist seems to be playing with a
sort of barnyard fantasy--exploring that elemental longing to reject
civilized behavior and live close to the ground. In one image,
"Soulsafari" (2000), she wallows in a shallow crate of hay; in
"Animal Shelter" (2000), she crouches under a cardboard box, her body
hidden but for her feet, disguised in a pair of monster claw
slippers.</TE>
<TE>   In several other images, Steinfeld appears with lumpy, globular
forms (made from foam-stuffed nylon stockings) bulging from various
parts her body. Think of a hard-boiled egg that's leaked slightly
during the boiling process and acquired a bubbly growth of white
along the crack in its shell: This is how Steinfeld's body appears in
these pictures, as though internal matter were oozing out and
subsuming her external form.</TE>
<TE>   The work--which seeks to blend aspects of photography, sculpture
and performance--is very funny but also unnervingly intimate. The
surreal creatures that Steinfeld has assembled here are like visitors
from a dream world in which the contours of the flesh are not static
but shift according to the dictates of one's imagination. Though her
face is hidden in every image, her body conveys the mind's internal
workings.</TE>

<TE>   Nothing Complex</TE>
<TE>   in These 'Signs'</TE>
<TE>   Charlie Bidwell's first solo exhibition at Jan Kesner Gallery,
"Signs and Signifiers," is more forthright than one might expect from
its rather academic-sounding title. The 10 works on display are
indeed photographs of signs--cool, old metallic and neon signs, the
rapidly disappearing remnants of roadside Americana. Bidwell has
found interesting ones and made them into handsome photographs: large
black-and-white prints that are sparely composed and elegant in tone.
Each depicts a single sign viewed from street level and silhouetted
against a smoothly gradated gray-to-black sky like some sort of
linguistic constellation advertising from the heavens: "Norms,"
"Gulf," "Pure" or "Tropicana" ("Adult Hotel Hourly Room Rates").</TE>
<TE>   The meaning of the title's "signifiers" is also plain
enough--perhaps too much so. The work means to imply that these
signs, though disembodied from their original referents (the motels,
gas stations and restaurants they were intended to advertise),
continue to convey an array of nostalgic associations in the mind of
21st century American viewers. This is true--indeed, the advertising
industry depends on similar logic every day--but it's not especially
revealing, and one finds oneself longing for a little more conceptual
reach.</TE>
<TE>   Self-consciously patterned in the roving-American-observer
tradition of Walker Evans and Ed Ruscha, this work succeeds in only
half of the equation that gave their work potency: It's smart on
visual appeal but short on depth.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>My cell phone rings in Houston, where I'm wrapping up research for a
new play, a play co-commissioned by the Geffen Playhouse and A.S.K.
Theater Projects.</LD>
<LD>   The call is from Los Angeles, informing me that Audrey
Skirball-Kenis has died. Though I'm already wilting in Gulf Coast
humidity on a bright afternoon, my shoulders droop even lower at the
news; I experience a personal sense of loss, as if a favorite
great-aunt has just passed away.</LD>
<LD>   On reflection, the sensation surprises me, because though I was
one of hundreds of beneficiaries of this woman's vision, intellectual
vitality and generosity, I met her only once.</LD>
<TE>   Playwrights are a distinct species in the arts world, especially
in Los Angeles, where the notion of writing dialogue for any medium
other than film or television is regarded as lunacy. Skirball-Kenis
took a portion of her wealth, which she could have chosen to direct
anywhere in the philanthropic world, and created A.S.K. Theater
Projects, saying, in effect, "The theater matters, playwrights are
important, talent needs encouragement."</TE>
<TE>   That notion was enormously gratifying to those of who live here
and write plays. Audrey Skirball-Kenis became our fairy godmother. We
never saw her, but felt we knew her because she made so many good
things happen for us, and, through A.S.K.'s programs, brought us
together to learn from one another.</TE>
<TE>   At the time that A.S.K. Theater Projects (first called Audrey
Skirball-Kenis Theater) was created, a playwright would finish a
draft, maybe ask a few friends over to read it aloud, send the
manuscript off to theaters and producers, and pray.</TE>
<TE>   What A.S.K. recognized then--and today does in an even more
far-reaching way--was that plays and playwrights benefit from
development before being sent out into the larger world of regional
and commercial theaters and new work programs.</TE>
<TE>   Balancing the process at the other end of the line, A.S.K. became
an important underwriter of major new play development programs
across the country (most generously at the Taper in Los Angeles and
the Public Theater in New York). Through its playwright-exchange
program with London's Royal Court Theatre, A.S.K.'s reach became
international.</TE>
<TE>   Skirball-Kenis' wonderfully peculiar vision evolved into a
lifeline for L.A. playwrights. A.S.K. is our nerve center, our
clubhouse, our workshop. And though we never saw her (even some
longtime staffers at A.S.K. never met her), we felt we knew
her--after all, she was the A.S.K.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, to celebrate its 10th anniversary, A.S.K.
commissioned 10 authors whose work it had developed to write short
plays inspired by Los Angeles and theater in the previous decade.</TE>
<TE>   I was one of those commissioned authors and wanted my play to be
both a personal and public way of saying thank you to Charles and
Audrey (as we all referred to our elusive benefactress and her
astute, devoted husband). At this point, though A.S.K. had developed
nearly every play I'd written, I had not yet met Skirball-Kenis, nor
had any other playwright I knew.</TE>
<TE>   My 10th anniversary piece sprang from my experience selling real
estate in the early 1990s while beginning to write plays. I wrote
about Eugene O'Neill, a Coldwell Banker agent who writes thunderously
dramatic property brochures by day, and equally dramatic plays by
night. A wealthy couple, whom I named Charles and Audrey, come into
his Sunday open house, read the brochures and, spotting true talent,
offer to underwrite readings of his plays. The real estate agent with
a secret passion suddenly becomes a playwright, albeit one with a day
job.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Kenis was in the audience when the plays were presented at
the Getty Center, and loved my piece. I've heard that since then, he
recognizes me with a grin as "the guy who put Audrey and me in his
play." Unfortunately, she wasn't able to attend that celebration, but
we finally did meet a little over a year later, at a fairly glamorous
party: the opening night in February of the Geffen Playhouse
production of my play "God's Man in Texas."</TE>
<TE>   Movie stars, agents and producers crowded the reception room, but
the hand I wanted to shake was the elegant, if frail, hand of Charles
Kenis' sweetheart.</TE>
<TE>   "God's Man in Texas" had been on a journey that started in the
A.S.K. conference room with three actors and the A.S.K. literary
staff, then went to the Humana Festival at Actors Theatre of
Louisville, the Alliance Theatre in Atlanta, the Globe theaters in
San Diego, and dozens of others. The play was named one of the 10
most-produced in the country for the 2001-02 season by American
Theatre magazine. Its success brought me commissions for new work and
future productions, and the freedom to do the one thing I love most:
write plays. The coronet upon all this was the stunning production
opening at the Geffen Playhouse that night, in the town I've called
home for two decades.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing how rarely Skirball-Kenis was seen and how grateful the
playwrights I knew were for her philanthropy, I felt as if I had to
use this meeting to speak for many. I held regal, vivacious Audrey
Skirball-Kenis' hand and finally was able to say directly, "Thank
you; you've made so much possible for so many of us." She smiled,
nodded and waved off the compliment. We made small talk for a few
minutes, and then our fairy godmother was whisked away to watch my
play.</TE>
<TE>   Now, she's been whisked away again, perhaps only to a better seat
from which to smile, nod, wave and watch all our plays.</TE>

<HD>No Sequel to 'Juwanna Mann,' Please, Much Less a Three-Peat</HD>

<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the outtakes at the end don't make you laugh, what does that
tell you about the movie that preceded them?</LD>
<LD>   Let's give the benefit of the doubt to those who probably thought
there was a glimmer of potential in the basic concept of "Juwanna
Mann." Must have made a sweet pitch to the suits: Hot-dogging,
ball-hawking egocentric pro basketball star (Miguel A. Nunez Jr.)
goes way too far in displaying (so to speak) his displeasure over
being yanked from a game. His reputation, his goodies, his wife and
his house fade away to the point that he has to move back home. He
decides the best way to retrieve the lost glory is to dress up as a
woman and play for the WNBA.</LD>
<LD>   Sorry, that's the WUBA in this film. Can't imagine why the real
pro league would sign off on this unless it had a psychic flash that
this thing would turn out to be "Tootsie" for preschoolers, "Some
Like It Hot" with training wheels.</LD>
<TE>   Too bad, because a lot of talent is wasted in this crass,
low-wattage endeavor, starting with Nunez, so good as the young
Little Richard in "Why Do Fools Fall in Love" (1998) and the funniest
bit player in the just-released "Scooby-Doo."</TE>
<TE>   As both Jamal Jeffries and his alter ego, Juwanna Mann, Nunez is
encouraged to play his role at the same level of over-the-top,
in-your-face shrillness from the beginning until the very end. Worse,
he expends this effort to play what is, in essence, someone's
stereotypical idea of an egomaniacal basketball star instead of
someone with complexes that are even remotely recognizable in real
life.</TE>
<TE>   Vivica A. Fox, whose comedic graces are still waiting for the
right vehicle, gets to only glower and twinkle as the captain of the
women's team--and Jamal-Juwanna's romantic interest. (The filmmakers
play a game of chicken with the possibilities here. In the end, no
one wins.)</TE>
<TE>   The most interesting performances are, in hoop-speak, at the
movie's perimeter. One wanted much more of Kim Wayans as Juwanna's
not-so-ambiguously gay teammate. And it's a kick to watch Tommy
Davidson satisfy his robust appetite for scenery--with jeweled
choppers, no less--as a rap star named (Why, God, why?) Puff Smokey
Smoke who's hot for Juwanna. Both these "In Living Color" vets need
their own movies--and better people to make them. Clock's running.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for language and sex-related material.</TE>

<HD>Writer's Suicide Puts 'Cleansed' in a Tragic Framework</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the few brief years that constituted her professional career,
playwright Sarah Kane was both lionized and pilloried in British
theatrical circles. Kane's plays, with their graphic scenes of sex,
torture and mutilation, were decried by many as pure filth and just
as passionately defended by luminaries, such as Harold Pinter, who
praised the brilliance of her dark vision.</LD>
<LD>   When Kane killed herself in 1999 at age 28, speculation that
critical drubbing had hastened her death sparked widespread
reassessment of the playwright's life and works. Her harshest critics
issued anguished recantations. Her intimates warned against judging
Kane's sparse canon in light of her self-annihilation. Kane's
suicide, they argued, should be viewed as incidental, a sidebar to
her autonomous artistry.</LD>
<LD>   Viewing the Rude Guerrilla Theater Company's production of Kane's
"Cleansed" at the Empire Theater in Santa Ana, that distinction
becomes impossible. Without the context of Kane's suicide, the dismal
and lubricious exchanges that constitute "Cleansed" would seem
depressingly gratuitous. In light of Kane's death, they are tragic.
This is not so much a play as a sustained shriek--a cry for help that
went unanswered.</LD>
<TE>   The setting is an abandoned university that houses a mysterious
institution presided over by Tinker (Jay Fraley), a tortured torturer
of ambivalent sexuality who doles out drugs and punishments to his
terrified patients-prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   Part mental hospital, part concentration camp, Tinker's domain is
the arena for continual atrocities, both physical and psychological.</TE>
<TE>   The inmates of these hellish precincts are hurtin' for certain. A
bereaved sister (Larissa Tidwell) engages in incest with the spirit
of her dead brother (Scott Caster). Gay lovers (Bryan Jennings and
Stephen Wagner) try to forge a sustaining emotional alliance, while
the hatchet-wielding Tinker whittles away their humanity--along with
their vital protuberances. (Puppet rats feed freely on the bounty of
severed limbs.) In turn, Tinker struggles for some psychological
connection with a sex slave (Molly Dewane), and a gentle boy (Scott
Barber), thwarted in love, hangs himself.</TE>
<TE>   Director Dave Barton excavates his material to the exacting depths
of a conscientious gravedigger, while an intrepid cast bares all and
dares all pursuing Kane's fool's fire into the boneyard.</TE>
<TE>   Kane's point, such as it is, is that cruelty abounds in this
wicked world, and all human love is doomed from the outset. Sadly,
the kind of barbarity seen in "Cleansed" is not beyond imagining; it
is the stuff of daily headlines. What seemed beyond Kane's imagining
was the bounteous potential of human charity and true love.
Apparently, she ended her life without that ameliorating knowledge.</TE>

<TE>   An Optimistic Vision of</TE>
<TE>   Emotional Traumas</TE>
<TE>   Life is full of surprises and, in British playwright Sarah
Daniels' unabashedly optimistic vision, many of those surprises can
be self-transforming, no matter how late in life they occur.</TE>
<TE>   At the outset, the opportunity for such transformations seems long
past for the solitary 65-year-old spinster at the heart of Daniels'
"The Madness of Esme and Shaz" at the Celebration Theatre. A
pensioner who long ago severed all ties with her family, Esme plans
nothing more ambitious for her retirement years than to learn to play
the piano. Patricia Fraser's feisty, charismatic performance as Esme
quickly nails the prickly defensiveness of a wounded soul who hides
behind religious devotion, not as a path to spirituality but as
insulation from the world's sharp edges.</TE>
<TE>   Esme's carefully constructed fortress (manifested in Donna
Marquet's all-gray set) crumbles when she reluctantly agrees to
become the caretaker for a troubled lesbian niece she's never known.
After having "come off the worse in a confrontation with a penal
institution" (Daniels loves to play with British euphemisms for
tiptoeing around unpleasant realities), Shaz (a convincingly angry
and suspicious Annmarie Hehir) has spent the last 13 years in a
psychiatric ward. As a result, her tenuous grip on socialized
behavior soon pits her against Esme's deep-rooted rules of propriety.</TE>
<TE>   In a riff on "Shirley Valentine" meets "Girl, Interrupted," their
conflicts spark psychological rebirth in both women, after forcing
them to confront the roots of their problems. The buried traumas
aren't hard to guess, but they're exposed with credible and effective
dramatic logic.</TE>
<TE>   Director Betsy Burke skillfully modulates Esme and Shaz's evolving
emotional relationship (though her staging sometimes resorts to
unnecessary flourishes, such as distracting character entrances from
the rear aisles). Supporting performances from Peggy Dunne, Laura
Gardner, Seema Rahmani and Kara Dahl Russell are less precise than
those of the leads, but they hit their emotional marks with
acceptable clarity.</TE>
<TE>   Not fully solved, however, is the play's uneasy waffling between
gritty realism--including the horrors of sexual abuse,
self-mutilation and a dehumanized penal system--and fairy-tale happy
endings that depend far too much on the kindness of strangers.</TE>
<TE>   Life may be full of surprises, but to see miraculous generosity of
spirit spontaneously blooming in even the peripheral characters
situates the slow, difficult and very partial process of
self-transformation in the realm of wishful thinking. Philip Brandes</TE>

Monica Blvd., Hollywood. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m.

<TE>   'Titus' Stirs Shakespeare Into a Tantalizing Stew</TE>
<TE>   There are two ways to view "Titus Tartar" at City Garage. You can
keep your brain on high alert, striving to catch every nuance of
Albert Ostermaier's fascinating take on Shakespeare's "Titus
Andronicus." Or you can fall asleep. Passive observation is not an
option.</TE>
<TE>   Ostermaier's text, translated by Anthony Vivis with additional
text by Charles A. Duncombe Jr., is not so much a deconstruction as
it is a demolition job. The complicated plot and characters of
Shakespeare's original are reduced to mere backdrop for Ostermaier's
flowing, fanciful verbiage.</TE>
<TE>   Stark white mannequins are part of the backdrop in Duncombe's
eerie production design. In the play's opening monologue, a man (Paul
M. Rubenstein) laments: "Do you know what it's like to have your art
taken away from you?" The artist's powerlessness in society, the
yawning divide between pure creative expression and commercial
success, the particular danger of politicized art are prevalent
themes--powerful points, although belabored. A prominent poet and
playwright in his native Germany, Ostermaier reiterates his plaint
about the artist's sad lot to a narcissistic degree.</TE>
<TE>   To illustrate the perils of ideological compromise, Ostermaier
trots out Leni Riefenstahl (Katharina Lejona) and Ezra Pound
(Rubenstein) as cautionary examples of artists whose work was
subsumed in the pathological mass culture of fascism.</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood Ten are invoked early on. "Yes, I named names," a
character defiantly admits. Faced with artistic suppression, he
chooses betrayal.</TE>
<TE>   The connection of all this with "Titus Andronicus" is intriguingly
speculative. Perhaps Lavinia (Maia Brewton), Titus' tongue-less
daughter, is meant as an exponent of the voiceless artist. And maybe
this doppelganger Titus, played here by Stephan Pocock and Bo
Roberts, is intended to emphasize the duality of the artist--again,
that painful gap between culture and creativity.</TE>
<TE>   At least, those are possible interpretations. As for you, let your
gray matter be your guide. The most certain elements in this
tantalizing stew are the combined artistic efforts of director
Frederique Michel and Duncombe--a proven team who continue to
challenge area audiences with the purposely arcane. F.K.F.</TE>

<HD>A Florida of Colliding Cultures</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Sayles has always been interested in the world, and the world
has been pleased to return the compliment, supplying the
writer-director with meaty situations that make for meaningful
cinema.</LD>
<LD>   During the past several years, Sayles' films have evolved into a
crash course on the cultures that make up the American scene. With
films like "Matewan" (West Virginia), "Passion Fish" (Louisiana),
"Lone Star" (Texas) and "Limbo" (Alaska), he's gone where his
interest and the issues have taken him, providing a series of
provocative slices of contemporary life.</LD>
<LD>   In "Sunshine State," his latest film, Sayles, working with
longtime producer Maggie Renzi, looks at a moment in time in today's
Florida, where the inexorable drive to develop is taking on all
comers. With a wide range of people displayed on a broad canvas,
Sayles' films are always of interest, and even though the partly
cloudy "Sunshine State" is not the writer-director at his best, even
his letdowns often have more to offer than other people's successes.</LD>
<TE>   "Sunshine State" is set on a mythical Florida island inspired by
the real-life Amelia Island, where filming took place. Three separate
cultures uneasily coexist here, fighting for turf as well as for
survival. The most recent arrivals are the golfers, whose bastion is
the wealthy enclave of Plantation Island, a manicured community
described by member Murray Silver (Alan King), a typical refugee from
the North, as "nature on a leash." Silver and company have contempt
for the area's original white settlers (he calls them "white people
who ate catfish"), locals who live in Delrona Beach, a nondescript
town that's being eagerly eyed by several sets of developers.</TE>
<TE>   The third group is the island's African American community, whose
Lincoln Beach area is considered by its residents, led by the
charismatic Dr. Lloyd (Bill Cobbs), to be of great historical
interest because it was for decades the only beachfront in this part
of the state where blacks were welcome. This certainly is a setup
with considerable potential, perhaps too much.</TE>
<TE>   "Sunshine State" has a tendency to be too didactic at times, to be
of more pressing sociological than dramatic interest, as some
characters get lost or feel underdeveloped in the welter of
intriguing factual information the film wants us to know. That said,
"Sunshine State," has several potent performances in it, starting
with Edie Falco as Marly Temple, a sixth-generation Floridian who
unhappily runs the local motel, the Sea-Vue, for her feuding parents,
Furman (Ralph Waite) and Delia (Jane Alexander). Falco, best known as
Carmela Soprano, gives the performance of the film as the brusque,
forceful, nervy Marly, who takes an interest in tony landscape
architect Jack Meadows (an excellent Timothy Hutton) though she knows
she probably shouldn't.</TE>
<TE>   If Marly has spent her whole life in town trying to get out,
Desiree Perry (Angela Bassett) has been gone since she was 15 and is
coming back with her anesthesiologist husband (James McDaniel) to
attempt a semblance of peace with an aging mother who has just taken
troubled teenage arsonist Terrell (Alex Lewis) under her wing.</TE>
<TE>   Bassett, as always hard to take your eyes off of, is well-matched
by the quietly powerful Mary Alice as her elegant, needling mother,
Eunice Stokes, who's never forgiven Desiree her youthful
indiscretions. Then there's the fact that Desiree's seemingly
promising acting career (Marly's mother, Delia, was her teacher) now
consists largely of infomercials.</TE>
<TE>   Not all of the key characters, though, are given as much to do as
the aforementioned. Mary Steenburgen as Delrona Beach's biggest
Chamber of Commerce booster and Gordon Clapp as her banker husband
appear so infrequently you forget they're part of the film. Tom
Wright as former football star Flash Phillips arrives too late in an
already long film to make the impression he's intended to.</TE>
<TE>   Yet if "Sunshine State" doesn't always live up to the standards
the writer-director himself has set, this is still a John Sayles
project and that counts for a lot. Even if it pushes its agenda too
forcefully, this remains a film about something, one that attempts
and often achieves a level of connection and concern. That's too
uncommon a scenario to be dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for brief strong language, a sexual reference
and thematic elements. Times guidelines: adult subject matter.</TE>

Start</HD>

<LD>As first acts go, tonight's two-hour premiere of Showtime's new
science-fiction series "Odyssey 5" (8 p.m.) hits the ground
running--and fast.</LD>
<LD>   With the opening credits still rolling, a half-dozen American
astronauts are bantering good-naturedly aboard their trusty craft,
with the warm, blue-green glow of Earth serving as a comforting
backdrop.</LD>
<LD>   Then, as one of the female astronauts looks on in disbelief, the
planet implodes in a fiery swirl before disappearing altogether. As
the crumpled, charred remnants of an SUV float past, crew members,
led by Commander Chuck Taggart (Peter Weller), begin to reassess
their reentry plans.</LD>
<TE>   With oxygen running out and nowhere to go, the crew drifts into
unconsciousness, only to awaken sometime later in the presence of a
mysterious figure. "I guess I should have expected it," says African
American astronaut Sarah Forbes (Leslie Silva). "God is an old white
guy."</TE>
<TE>   But Heaven can wait. This old white guy, who calls himself the
Seeker, says he can set the clock back five years and put the space
travelers back in their earthly bodies so they can foil the forces
responsible for the planet's destruction. It's an offer they can't
refuse.</TE>
<TE>   That's the audacious kickoff to the weekly hourlong series that
will air at 10 p.m. on Fridays after tonight's feature-length
special. Even if you're not a Showtime subscriber but do have basic
cable, you can watch tonight's series debut as part of the channel's
free preview weekend.</TE>
<TE>   It's a shrewd move by Showtime, because this series has
considerable viewer-hooking appeal. When the crew members reconvene
back on Earth during tonight's second hour and begin to form their
five-year plan, you know the fun is only beginning.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A little girl named Lilo looks out of her window and, in traditional
Disney fashion, wishes on a falling star. "I need someone to be my
friend," she says. "Maybe send me an angel, the nicest angel you
have."</LD>
<LD>   It's a swell thought, kid, but tradition is not on the menu this
time around. That star is actually a crashing spaceship, the
hoped-for angel turns out to be an obnoxious genetically engineered
monster, "the flawed product of a deranged mind," and "Lilo &amp; Stitch"
is definitely not the kind of animated Disney family film we've
become used to.</LD>
<LD>   Looser and less obviously formulaic in its fresh approach to our
hearts, the brash "Lilo &amp; Stitch" has an unleashed, subversive sense
of humor that's less corporate and more uninhibited than any
non-Pixar Disney film has been in time out of mind. With its
hand-drawn characters and its use of watercolors for backgrounds (the
first time the studio's done that since the 1940s), this is a happy
throwback to the time when cartoons were cinema's most idiosyncratic
form instead of one of its most predictable.</LD>
<TE>   That's likely the result, at least in part, of Disney's agreeing
to an unusual setup in which writer-directors Chris Sanders &amp; Dean
DeBlois, in a departure from typical animation practice, also
story-boarded their script, ensuring that the anarchic spirit that
infused their original concept wouldn't get diluted. For it's not
only Stitch, a relentless combination of koala and chaos interested
only in destroying everything he touches, who's out of the usual
Disney mold. Little Lilo (voiced by Daveigh Chase) is hardly a walk
in the park either.</TE>
<TE>   Raised as best she can by older sister Nani (Tia Carrere), Lilo is
introduced as brattiness personified, way too hostile to her sister
and everyone else to be perceived as anything but a tedious
troublemaker. Lilo's eccentric passion for Elvis Presley (the film
makes wonderful use of six of the King's biggest hits, from "Hound
Dog" to "Heartbreak Hotel") is one of her few humanizing traits.</TE>
<TE>   Given that both of its title characters are scruffy, unpleasant
outcasts who take considerable warming up to, "Lilo &amp; Stitch's"
surprising ability to both explain how they got that way and motivate
their inevitable transition to better behavior and genuine caring
(this is a Disney film, after all) is that much more unlikely and
impressive.</TE>
<TE>   "Lilo &amp; Stitch" begins, in a deft parody of the "Star Wars" sagas,
in a meeting of the Galactic Federation on the planet Turo. Mad
scientist Jumba (David Ogden Stiers) is convicted of illegal genetic
experimentation, and the resulting creature, named Experiment 626, is
to be exiled to a desert asteroid.</TE>
<TE>   But 626, nothing if not unstoppable, manages to escape and get
himself to the Hawaiian island of Kauai, where he disguises himself
as the strangest-looking dog and is adopted by the lonely Lilo. She
calls him Stitch and, happy for a friend, overlooks his wacky
destructive proclivities, such as an ability to magically turn her
toys into a facsimile of San Francisco only to enthusiastically stomp
the city to pieces a la Godzilla. (Parents, be prepared to do a lot
of explaining.)</TE>
<TE>   Unknown to these fast friends, threats are forming on the horizon.
"Men in Black"-esque social worker Cobra Bubbles (Ving Rhames), given
to saying such things as "You've been adrift in the sheltered harbor
of my patience," is threatening to split the family. Plus the
Galactic Federation, which has come to view our planet as a protected
wildlife preserve for the mosquito, with humans useful only as part
of that insect's food chain, dispatches both creator Jumbo and
deluded Earth expert Pleakley (Kevin McDonald) to capture 626 and
throw away the key.</TE>
<TE>   "Lilo &amp; Stitch" is not only set on Kauai, it features many
specific references, such as a cart selling shaved ice and what looks
like the lobby of the Hanalei Bay Resort. And the film's overriding
theme, the Hawaiian notion of ohana or family, meaning "nobody gets
left behind or forgotten," is a specifically island one.</TE>
<TE>   "Lilo &amp; Stitch" makes excellent use of the best of Disney's
animators. Andreas Deja, who was the supervising animator for Gaston
in "Beauty and the Beast" and Jafar in "Aladdin," takes on the
recalcitrant Lilo, and Alex Kuperschmidt, responsible for the hyenas
in "The Lion King," makes the jabbering Stitch (grumbles and rumbles
voiced by writer-director Sanders) remarkably expressive.</TE>
<TE>   Though the requisite happy ending is inevitable, "Lilo &amp; Stitch"
is too unhinged to feel arbitrary. It's just a film that believes, as
Boys Town's legendary founder Father Flanagan did, that there's no
such thing as a bad boy. Or a bad girl. Or, for that matter, a bad
alien.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG, for mild sci-fi action. Times guidelines: A few
briefly scary scenes and lots of frenetic activity.</TE>

<LD>Simon Says It's a Party</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Camryn Manheim was walking through the back entrance to the W
hotel in Westwood, en route to an after-party for the old-and-new
Neil Simon play Wednesday night. Peering into the main lobby (the
party was at the back), she was stopped by a bouncer, who told her
she couldn't come in carrying a glass of wine. "They're segregating
us," she complained to her companion. "They don't [like] those
theater people."</LD>
<TE>   But the theater people inside, who had just attended the premiere
of "Oscar and Felix--a New Look at the Odd Couple" at the Geffen
Playhouse, were plenty friendly.</TE>
<TE>   Seated on a couch was Neil Simon, 74, who, with director Peter
Bonerz, had updated the 1965 classic.</TE>
<TE>   Simon so enjoyed working in L.A., he said, that he's planning to
do another play here sometime next year. On Broadway, money distorts
everything, Simon said. "There's so much pressure to have a mega-hit.
Not here. You just want to do something good."</TE>
<TE>   Everyone was a little star-struck.</TE>
<TE>   "He appeared in my life when I needed some light," said Maria
Conchita Alonso, who stars in the play. "He's an angel."</TE>
<TE>   "To work with Neil Simon, one on one," Bonerz said, "it's quite
extraordinary." After rehearsals, the playwright had given him a
personal note, typed on his Remington typewriter. Bonerz was planning
to find a 24-hour framing store on his way home. "If there's a show
business heaven," he said, "it'd be the pass to get in."</TE>

<TE>   Shot Films That Make Big Ripples</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Moomba in West Hollywood, best known for its high celebrity
quotient, has been drawing a decidedly different midweek crowd over
the last six months. Every Wednesday night around 10, a group of 20-
to 30-somethings, many in T-shirts and jeans, head downstairs to a
room of plush mattresses and couches.The red felt pool table is
pushed aside, the funk music silenced, and a series of film shorts
plays on the screen at the front of the room.</TE>
<TE>   Recent Pepperdine University MBA grad and film producer Pernilla
Nelson started the screenings, dubbed the Short Film Forum, to
showcase new talent and provide an alternative to the festival
circuit. Now the regulars range from students to established
filmmakers looking for distributors.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not the trendy club crew," said Nelson, 30. "The only thing
trendy is the place and location. There's no guest list. It's free."
But the screenings have attracted notice, and visibility for some of
the filmmakers.</TE>
<TE>   Director Christopher Olness, 28, screened a film about a young boy
who faces his fear of water after witnessing his brother's drowning.
The 20-minute short, "Learning to Swim," was picked up by Showtime,
and Olness credits the Moomba screening with helping him get his film
out there, "especially when it is so hard to get people to see your
work in this town."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone is welcome to drop by with a VHS or DVD, and by the end of
this month, budding filmmakers may also e-mail the material to
indiemoomba@yahoo.com. Nelson makes selections from the submissions
with Mike Deenie, an independent film director who hopped on board
about four months ago to help organize the series.</TE>
<TE>   On one recent night, the audience viewed "Eyeball Eddie," a comedy
that stars "Smallville's" Lex Luthor Michael Rosenbaum as the
opponent of a wrestler who wins matches by spooking opponents with
his glass eye. On another night, actor Eddie Kaye Thomas ("American
Pie") screened a short film he directed about two brothers who are
DJs. In the audience was actor Ron Perlman ("Blade II") who dropped
by to support the new filmmakers.</TE>
<TE>   The film festival circuit has also gotten wind of the Wednesday
night event. Folks at Nodance in Park City, Utah, turned to Nelson to
hold a local screening of their work, and last month, Moomba hosted
an evening of the best Nodance shorts from the last five years. In
July, Nelson and Deenie will do the same for Slamdance.</TE>
<TE>   Moomba, in turn, will send its best work to the Silver Lake Film
Festival.</TE>
<TE>   No one at the screenings seems to mind the sounds of cocktail
chatter from upstairs or the occasional crash of a beer bottle
because, as Deenie puts it, "it is a warm atmosphere, like a living
room." Except, of course, for the bartender, the waitresses and the
unnaturally high ratio of directors-actors-producers.</TE>

<LD>   How One Man Remade</LD>
<LD>   the World With Words</LD>
<TE>   by John Man</TE>
<TE>   John Wiley &amp; Sons</TE>
<TE>   312 pages, $24.95</TE>
<TE>   After Johann Gutenberg died and was buried in 1468, a monument was
erected on his grave that called him "Inventor of the art of
printing" and "Deserver of the best from all nations and tongues."</TE>
<TE>   No simpler nor more accurate description of the master from Mainz
could be devised. In a few short years, beginning in 1450, he had
changed the world forever with his printing press and movable type.</TE>
<TE>   When Gutenberg undertook this work, according to John Man, the
author of books about the alphabet and Mongolia, he wanted to make a
lot of money by supplying the Roman Catholic Church with Bibles and
missals. He made the money, but in a hundred years his invention
would also rend the church in two.</TE>
<TE>   His invention, which the Church first praised as helpful, was soon
denounced as devilish, so destructive to the Church was the release
of the quick and easy spread of knowledge and opinion made possible
by Gutenberg's invention.</TE>
<TE>   There are no recent books in English about Gutenberg. That is
possibly because the known facts of his life are few. Man generously
acknowledges the magisterial account published in German in 1939 by
Aloys Ruppel.</TE>
<TE>   Man weaves on the spare warp of what is known of the master
printer's life and work a tapestry of life in the 15th century,
centered on the powerful city of Mainz, where Gutenberg was born,
perhaps in 1400, and where he did much of his great work. It is a
tale of a Europe with a small population, anchored by more or less
independent cities and archbishoprics, emerging into modern
capitalist life against a background of wars, the plague and the
Roman Catholic Church splintered by divisions and deeply corrupt.</TE>
<TE>   What Gutenberg did was dazzling in its simplicity. He put together
two well-known existing technologies to form a third that changed
mankind forever.</TE>
<TE>   There was the technology of the wine press, in which a screw was
turned to force down the cover of a barrel to force the juice from
the grapes it contained. There was the technology of the punch, by
which a long metal bar imprinted with a pattern on its end was struck
against a matrix of softer metal (molten metal could then be poured
into this imprint, or mould, to make a coin or medal).</TE>
<TE>   By creating matrices, then cutting them into single blocks,
Gutenberg devised movable type. Man emphasizes that the creation of
Gutenberg's first and greatest work, the Bible, required large
amounts of money and manpower.</TE>
<TE>   Gutenberg's Bible appeared in 30 to 45 copies on vellum--dried and
stretched animal skin--and 130 to 150 copies on high-quality paper. A
paper Bible cost a third of a vellum one.</TE>
<TE>   The new technology spread quickly, first in Germany, then
throughout Europe. In Venice the printer Aldus Manutius printed books
of the Greek and Latin classics, marked with the sign of a dolphin
and an anchor that are to this day objects of imitated but
unsurpassed elegance. Gutenberg's Bible was a thing of beauty, two
columns of 42 lines side-by-side on each page set with ample spacing
top and bottom, left and right.</TE>
<TE>   By 1500, Man estimates, Europe may have had 1,000 printing works
employing between 10,000 and 20,000 men. Before Gutenberg, it took a
month or two to produce by manuscript one book; after, one could make
500 copies in a week. By 1500, Man writes, Europe's presses had
produced 15 or 20 million books.</TE>
<TE>   Man takes the reader on various paths through the terrain in which
Gutenberg's invention appeared. In England, printer William Tyndale's
English Bible helped standardize that fluid language. Martin Luther,
who rode the new invention to the turbulent Reformation, did the same
for German with his Bible.</TE>
<TE>   Curiously, the world of Islam, which had done so much to transmit
to the modern age the philosophy and science of the Greeks, was not
interested. Man, with the help of other scholars, speculates that
since Islam believed the pure word of God was transmitted only by
memorizing, then speaking the words of the Koran, printing was of no
utility.</TE>
<TE>   Printing has, of course, since conquered the world and has been
followed by the exponentially vaster Internet. The difference between
them seems to be that books can be beautiful, and you can hold them
in your hands.</TE>

<HD>On Some Airlines, Size Does Matter</HD>
<DH>Planned enforcement of policy charging extra for obese
travelers sparks debate</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One for the price of two. Not a very catchy business slogan,
especially from the consumer end. But when it comes to "people of
size," that's the news from Southwest Airlines.</LD>
<LD>   The Dallas-based airline said earlier this week that it will begin
a stricter enforcement of its 22-year-old policy of charging
extra-large customers--those who require seat belt extensions or
those who when seated can't lower the arm rests--to buy two tickets.
The second ticket will cost the same as the first; if the flight is
not full, a refund can be requested.</LD>
<LD>   The airline's crackdown on customers of girth, aimed, the airline
says, at ensuring passenger safety and comfort, coincides with the
carrier's recent shift to an automated boarding system. The action is
also designed to reduce customer complaints related to travelers
unhappy over flying next to an obese person.</LD>
<TE>   "If you consume more than one seat," Southwest spokeswoman Beth
Harbin told wire service reporters, "you will be charged for more
than one seat."</TE>
<TE>   There were certainly no belly laughs over the remark emanating
from the Sacramento-based offices of the National Assn. to Advance
Fat Acceptance. Fat, which is not a dirty word to the 5,000-strong
group that bills itself as a "human rights organization to empower
fat people," is simply a descriptive word to them, according to
spokeswoman Maryanne Bodolay.</TE>
<TE>   Southwest is not alone in drawing a line on the issue: Continental
and American Airlines are among those with similar policies (United
and Delta are among those without one). The policy comes at a time
when Americans are getting larger--and passengers of all sizes say
they feel squeezed by the space allotted them.</TE>
<TE>   "Southwest is penalizing and punishing me," said Bodolay, who
notes her 5-foot-10, 350-pound frame does take up 1 1/4 airline
seats. "Does this mean a thin person pays half-fare? These are the
kind of questions that have to be answered now."</TE>
<TE>   Bodolay has made accommodations to deal with the second-seat
issue. She usually flies with a friend or relative and sits next to
them. If alone, she usually buys an extra seat on her own. "Flying is
stressful enough for fat people," she said. "That just makes one less
thing to worry about. Hey, I want to make my flight and others' as
pleasant as possible."</TE>
<TE>   At Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport, folks at the Southwest
Airlines terminal this week seemed to be about evenly split about the
weighty debate.</TE>
<TE>   Some thought the policy cruel and that it would further stigmatize
an already ridiculed group, while others thought such a move was
overdue.</TE>
<TE>   "One passenger, one ticket," said Wendy Carroll, 50, who works for
the Arizona Film Commission in Phoenix. "What about a person with
broken leg or a disabled person? Why should they charge heavy people
for extra space? They should accommodate each passenger."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most passengers who were informally surveyed, Carroll, who
easily fits within Southwest's 18 3/4-inch-wide seats, has shared
space with a very large passenger. On a flight from Los Angeles to
Miami, she said, she sat next to a woman who Carroll estimated
weighed 500 pounds and had to be helped in and out of her seat.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an uncomfortable flight," Carroll said. "But she is a
special-needs person."</TE>
<TE>   Meredith Marsh, 24, waiting for an arrival at the terminal,
expressed a common ambivalence: It's discriminatory and that's
unfair, but if you have to surrender room you paid for, that's also
unfair.</TE>
<TE>   Marsh, as with most others interviewed, said she couldn't recall a
flight on which she was crowded by an extra-large person. "Maybe the
airlines should reserve a few seats just for fat people," said the
college student, who is 5 feet 4 and weights 120 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Others were sympathetic to the plight of the obese air traveler,
but felt the matter should be determined by the simple economics.</TE>
<TE>   "I always have to sit in the emergency exit because of my long
legs," said Paul Redmond, 42, who stands 6 feet 2 and weighs 200
pounds. "It doesn't sound unreasonable to me, but the market will
determine if it works or not."</TE>
<TE>   But many passengers welcomed the policy, which will largely be
enforced by ticket agents and flight attendants. Some supporters
wanted to remain anonymous for fear of appearing unfair.</TE>
<TE>   "It's discriminatory, I know," said one slender, middle-aged
traveler, "but I think it's a good idea. They are taking up my space
on the plane."</TE>
<TE>   It is discrimination, agreed Richard Hopp, who is 6 feet 3 and 320
pounds, but it's completely justified. He argues there is a premium
on space aboard airplanes. For instance, extra luggage means an extra
fee.</TE>
<TE>   "If large people aren't paying extra they are essentially getting
a discount," said the 32-year-old bail bondsman from the San Fernando
Valley. "Obesity is not a handicap; it's not a disability. It's a
choice."</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC)</TE>
<TE>   One Airline's Official Word on Size</TE>
<TE>   Here is the second-seat policy posted on the Southwest Airlines
Web site:</TE>
<TE>   Since 1980, Southwest Airlines has maintained a policy, for
purposes of customer safety and comfort, of requiring a customer to
purchase a second seat if the customer needs extra space, or if the
customer's girth is larger than one aircraft seat. Below are a few
points to help clarify our policy:</TE>
<TE>   * Customers who reserve and purchase a discounted, advance
purchase fare will be charged the same fare for the second seat, even
if the advance purchase requirements are not met at the time of the
second seat purchase.</TE>
<TE>   A customer who is holding an unrestricted walk-up fare will be
charged the appropriate discounted child's fare for the second seat.</TE>
<TE>   * Once travel has been completed, if the flight is not full, the
customer can request a full refund for the second seat by contacting
Southwest Airlines' Customer Relations Department.</TE>
<TE>   * This policy was designed to safely accommodate customers needing
extra space.</TE>
<TE>   * The policy is intended to promote the safety and comfort of all
customers on board and to ensure that no customers are deprived a
portion of the space they have purchased.</TE>

<LD>Now that retexturizing treatments, or "straight perms," are all the
rage at beauty salons, some patrons, especially those with colored
hair, are telling us they have learned that not every treatment
guarantees the desired result.</LD>
<LD>   At Tina Cassaday's Beverly Hills salon, the stylist and
"fix-it-doctor" has treated more than 500 cases so far this year of
post-straight-perm problems on colored and on natural hair. As a
trichologist who studies the hair, its molecular structure and
diseases, Cassaday has found that many of the processes used around
town are drying or changing the color of the hair. She uses a
microscope to be sure that her straightening process doesn't overdry
the hair, she said.</LD>
<LD>   Wavy-haired writer Susan Hayden had a retexturizing treatment on
her shoulder-length, colored and highlighted hair at the Gavert
Atelier salon in April. Her $300 treatment, which used a hot flatiron
and the same kind of chemicals that are in curly perms, did
straighten and add shine to her hair, "and it looked really nice,"
said the Santa Monica writer. But a few days later, some pieces
looked "fried."</LD>
<TE>   "I looked like I had escaped from a burning building, but not soon
enough," Hayden said. After getting most of her auburn hair cut off
at another salon, Hayden is happy about her new look, and many people
have complimented her new short 'do. "My husband fell in love with me
all over again," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Salon co-owner Stuart Gavert said that his salon has had good
results with the more than 2,000 treatments performed throughout the
past three years. "If the ironing is not done correctly, you can get
little fried spots like that," Gavert said. "There is no excuse for
that when you are charging that kind of money. Had we known about
this, of course, we would have refunded all of her money."</TE>
<TE>   Hayden said she was promised a refund from the salon this week.</TE>

<LD>Today is the first day of summer. That means the temperature in
Southern California is getting hot. If you were a plant, what kind
would you want to be?</LD>
<LD>   A cactus, which is a type of succulent, would be a good choice
because its stem acts like a water storage tank.</LD>
<LD>   Cacti (the plural of cactus) have tough waxy skin, sharp spines
and soft hair. They have bright, colorful and showy flowers that
often last only one day, and they produce fruit. There are about
1,800 species of cacti. They grow in many shapes and sizes and can be
found in the hot and dry sections of South, Central and North
America.</LD>
<TE>   Humans use cacti for food, water, medicines, building materials,
tools and decorations. Animals also use cacti for food, water and
shelter.</TE>
<TE>   All plants have a common name and a botanical name. For example,
the common name for one species of prickly pear cactus is "bunny
ears." Its botanical name is Opuntia microdasys. The common names for
other species of prickly pear include "beavertail," "porcupine" and
"pancake." Can you imagine what they might look like?</TE>
<TE>   To see other cacti, succulents and approximately 5,000 other
species of plants, visit the Mildred E. Mathias Botanical Garden at
UCLA in the heart of Westwood. To learn more about the garden, visit
www.botgard.ucla.edu or call (310) 825-1260.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You can lead people in the media to facts, but you can't make them
think.</LD>
<LD>   Consider the case of Ted Turner, the audacious entrepreneur who
helped change the face of global news and entertainment as a
visionary leader in the then-revolutionary technology of cable
television.</LD>
<LD>   It is a bit difficult to conceive a creative mind so fecund that
it gave rise to CNN, Turner Classic Movies and the Cartoon Network.
But it is harder still to imagine how a person in Turner's position,
now vice chairman of AOL Time Warner, can say so many willfully
ignorant and wickedly mistaken things.</LD>
<TE>   Over the years, Turner has insulted Catholics, evangelical
Christians and Holocaust survivors--among others--with various
intemperate and crude remarks. Only a centipede could put more feet
in its mouth. But this week, in one stunningly clueless sequence, he
managed to simultaneously affront both the Israelis and the
British--no mean feat.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview published in Tuesday's editions of Britain's
Guardian newspaper, Turner blundered onto the topic of Mideast
terrorism. "Right now, aren't the Israelis and the Palestinians both
terrorizing each other?" he rhetorically inquired of reporter Oliver
Burkeman.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks to me like they're both doing it. When the Brits
retaliated for the Germans, for the Krauts ... for the Nazis bombing
London by bombing Berlin, weren't you both terrorizing each other?
The rich and the powerful, they don't need to resort to terrorism.
The Palestinians are fighting with human suicide bombers; that's all
they have. The Israelis, they've got one of the most powerful
military machines in the world. The Palestinians have nothing. So who
are the terrorists? I would make a case that both sides are involved
in terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Regev, one of Israel's diplomatic spokesmen in Washington,
called Turner's "moral comparison ... both flawed and problematic."
To compare suicide bombers who target innocent civilians and acts of
national self-defense by "an army that makes a maximum effort not to
kill civilians is fundamentally not true."</TE>
<TE>   On the very morning Turner's foolishness hit the streets of
London, a fanatic committed murder-suicide by exploding a nail-filled
bomb on a Jerusalem bus crammed with commuters and schoolchildren.</TE>
<TE>   The sort of mind unable to distinguish between that atrocity and
the Israeli government's response to it is exactly the sort of mind
that morally conflates Nazi aggression and the heroic British
resistance that probably saved Western civilization. If it wasn't for
the RAF, Josef Goebbels' grandson might well have a talk show on CNN.
Actually, the way things are going with the cable news operations,
somebody like him probably will have one soon.</TE>
<TE>   Turner, of course, has apologized for his remarks--again.</TE>
<TE>   However, the real problem with Ted Turner is not that he says what
he thinks; it's that he obviously thinks the things he says.</TE>
<TE>   The Truth About Blogging</TE>
<TE>   Now, just to demonstrate that folly is constant from medium to
medium, consider another of this week's examples--the blogger Mickey
Kaus.</TE>
<TE>   Bloggers, in case you have been spending the irreplaceable moments
of your one and only life reading serious newspapers and good books,
are people who maintain Internet logs of their personal analysis and
reflections. It's sort of old wine in new skins, since the bloggers
are basically a narcissistic throwback to an easily recognizable
American type, the 19th century cranks who turned out mountains of
self-published pamphlets.</TE>
<TE>   The cranks had all sorts of idiosyncratic preoccupations--single
tax schemes, silver-backed currency, vegetarianism and the
metaphysical benefits of healthy bowels, for example. Bloggers tend
to dabble in politics, media and vendetta.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday, for instance, Kaus posted an item on his personal site
(www.kausfiles.com) praising former Washington Post editor Ben
Bradlee for allowing reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein to
publish their articles on Watergate at a rapid pace, even though that
"sometimes meant revealing unsubstantiated or simply wrong
information."</TE>
<TE>   According to Kaus, "Bradlee instinctively understood--you keep the
story going, with hit after little hit, which gets people talking,
which panics sources into coming forward, which gets other papers
into the hunt and ultimately brings much more information to light,
even if this means you occasionally get something wrong....This
virtue of Bradlee's editorship, it seems to me, is also a virtue of
blogging as a form of journalism. The Web really does put a premium
on speed and spontaneity over painstaking accuracy. Bloggers
instantly print what they learn, and what they believe to be true.
They sometimes--often, actually--get it wrong. But even those errors
prompt swift corrections that take the story asymptotically closer to
the truth."</TE>
<TE>   For those who cut that particular math class, "asymptotically" is
the adverbial form of the noun "asymptote," which is what you call a
straight line that always approaches but never actually meets a
curve. In other words, bloggers' frequent errors of fact are
inconsequential, since they push a story toward the truth, though it
never quite gets there, which apparently doesn't matter.</TE>
<TE>   Kaus argues the superiority of this approach to that of "the L.A.
Times editor of several decades ago" whose "unbloggish motto" was "Do
It Once, Do It Right, And Do It Long."</TE>
<TE>   At the risk of committing "painstaking accuracy," the editor was
Bill Thomas, who served until 1989. He was a veteran journalist with
a well-founded skepticism of self-interested newspaper crusades. He
had traditional notions about the facts, which led him to abhor
mistakes and to esteem fairness and balance. His motto was "Do it
once. Do it right." He certainly would have recognized an asymptotic
approach to the truth for what it is--an excuse and a scam.</TE>
<TE>   Work in Progress</TE>
<TE>   Herbert Gold is the San Francisco author of numerous short-story
collections and novels, most recently "Daughter Mine:"</TE>
<TE>   "I've been infected by the L.A. disease, and at the moment I'm
finishing a spec screenplay called 'The Helpful Mistress.' Several of
my novels have been optioned for films over the years, and one even
got made. But recently, I did a screenplay that was commissioned by a
major producer. I was really educated by the experience and was well
paid for it. I even bought my first computer and software that puts
your story into screenplay format.</TE>
<TE>   "I learned that if you're dealing with a director who wants to do
a musical and you don't, it's a difficult situation. With books,
people say, 'It's your work, Herb, and if it doesn't pan out, it's
your funeral.' In the film world, they fire you. I was amazed to be
fired, even though one should know that is what happens to writers in
Hollywood. It's still very bemusing.</TE>
<TE>   "I also have another novel in progress, too. It is tentatively
titled 'My First Murder.' "</TE>

<LD>World Cup Runneth Over</LD>
<LD>   Talk about net results.</LD>
<LD>   For all you fashionable soccer moms--and fans of the game, forget
the jersey tops and long socks. It's time to score with a
limited-edition handbag created by Michael Kors for Celine especially
for the World Cup.</LD>
<TE>   How the bag came about is just as intriguing as how the U.S.
soccer team has emerged in the quarterfinals and will play this
morning for a place in the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Paris-based Celine's president, Jean-Marc Loubier, a soccer fan,
came up with the idea and spoke to designer Kors about creating
it--separate from the ready-to-wear collection, according to Celine
spokesperson Tenley Black. "Michael's excited about the reaction,"
Black says from Celine's New York offices. "He was asked about soccer
a few weeks ago and he said that 'although the World Cup doesn't have
a high profile in the States, the rest of the world is coconuts about
soccer.' "</TE>
<TE>   Now Kors and his creative team are hoping the world will go
coconuts over his tribute-to-soccer creation, the Tie-Game Bag, with
4,000 crafted and numbered, to be sold worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   The bag is part of a World Cup-inspired line that includes hooded,
zippered tops, shorts, sneakers and other accessories. "Once they're
sold out, they're gone," Black says of the collection launched May
31, the day the World Cup kicked off.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Italian pop singer Anastacia, requested several of
the items, including the bag, for an appearance at World Cup closing
ceremonies, according to Black.</TE>
<TE>   The bag is available for $570 at Celine stores in Beverly Hills
and at South Coast Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   --Michael Quintanilla</TE>
<TE>   Dressed Up for a Call</TE>
<TE>   A negligee for your Nokia or a mackintosh for your Motorola,
perhaps? The newest fashion statement could be clothes for the cell
phone, thanks to L.A. designer Jun Li and her brocade phone covers
shaped like the traditional Chinese cheongsam dress.</TE>
<TE>   The idea was, as so many are, a fluke. Li, who designs full-size
cheongsams for M. Cole and other stores, began using leftover fabric
to make doll clothes for her 5-year-old daughter. One day it hit her
to try the dainty dresses on a cell phone. The result was so cute
that she attached a strap to the top of the mini-cheongsam and began
wearing it slung over her shoulder like a purse.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone stopped me in the parking lot on the way to drop one off
for a friend and asked if she could buy it," said Li, who lives in
Hacienda Heights.</TE>
<TE>   Now Li is selling the covers through a showroom at the
CaliforniaMart. Yvonne Greene, an L.A.-based fashion scout for New
York's Henri Bendel, says: "They are so fun and adorable. Bendel sold
40 of them in one week."</TE>
<TE>   The phone covers, $18 for small; $25 for large, are sold in L.A.
at Seaver, Leslie Howard and Jacqueline Jarrot stores.</TE>
<TE>   --Booth Moore</TE>
<TE>   The Stingray Look</TE>
<TE>   "Friends" costume designer Debra McGuire, has her finger on the
pulse of yet another emerging trend. She's set to launch a line of
handbags this fall called ARTe, made entirely from stingray skins.</TE>
<TE>   Bottega Veneta and Alexander McQueen are also dabbling in
accessories using the tough-as-nails stingray skins, which retain the
shiny patina of creatures of the deep and have a pearl-shaped mark
where the dorsal fin used to be. (Not sure how the stingray feels
about that.)</TE>
<TE>   "There's a spiritual quality to the material, and it's
indestructible," McGuire said at her Pacific Palisades atelier last
week. "It was used as armor in Japan, and they found it in pharaohs'
tombs."</TE>
<TE>   McGuire, 50, who also designs clothing by special order, is
looking forward to doing more with her own business after "Friends"
ends next season.</TE>
<TE>   But hopefully not before she gets a little free publicity on the
TV series. She says, "If there's a place for one of the purses, I may
try to sneak it in."</TE>
<TE>   ARTe purses and wallets, $600 to $1,400, are available at Elyse
Walker in Pacific Palisades and A'Maree's in Newport Beach.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dear Fashion Police: My company has relaxed its dress code, and women
are no longer required to wear pantyhose. I think this is great, but
when I wear closed-toe shoes my feet sweat and the shoes become
sticky and uncomfortable. I don't think sandals look professional
enough. I am already putting baby powder in my shoes, but this is not
really working.</LD>
<LD>   --TOO MUCH FOOTAGE</LD>
<LD>   Dear Too: Before we delve into your options, we'd like to relay a
word of caution about going sockless from Dr. Broxton Little, a
Pacific Palisades podiatrist.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't recommend bare feet in shoes because of the loss of a
protective barrier against the skin," he said. That barrier--socks or
stockings--not only guards against blisters, but in some cases helps
wick perspiration away from the feet. Moisture and heat are the
enemies, according to Dr. Little, because they can encourage bacteria
and fungi to grow, causing scaling and peeling, and make your feet
smell.</TE>
<TE>   Have we convinced you that wearing socks is a good idea? They
don't have to be bulky--trouser socks have the look of pantyhose but
only come up to the knee. Some cotton and cotton-blend socks are
thin. Footies or Peds are socks that just hug the foot and, depending
on the shoe style, don't show. We found Hidden Comfort Footies at One
Hanes Place for $4.99 for three pair ([800] 671-1674, www.one
hanesplace.com). AlexBlake.com offers Ellen Tracy Luxury Foot Peds,
$5 for three pair, and Hue Foot Liners, $1.47 per pair ([818]
501-4771, www.alexblake.com). For extra help there are
over-the-counter powders and sprays especially made for feet.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dear Fashion Police: I'm trying to find short cotton gloves for
day wear. I think they add a fun touch to business or casual outfits
and offer sun protection. I'd love to have them in neutrals and
pastels. The queen of England seems to be the only one who has worn
her little white gloves through the decades. I don't mind starting my
own trends.</TE>
<TE>   --FEEL THE GLOVE</TE>
<TE>   Dear Feel: We admire your willingness to set fashion trends, but
in this case we're not sure you're going to inspire many women to
storm accessory departments. Still, gloves can add a kicky retro look
when worn with the right styles, such as little '50s summer dresses
or nipped-waist suits. But keep in mind that although Her Majesty has
been wearing gloves for decades, her look is perceived as dowdy.</TE>
<TE>   Gloves do offer sun protection if they're made from a tightly
woven fabric. Sun Precautions has gloves that offer the equivalent of
30 SPF. The patented material is not cotton, but has a leather-like
feel. The gloves come in white and putty, in various sizes, for
$35.95 ([800] 882-7860, www.sun precautions.com).</TE>
<TE>   Most short all-cotton gloves are sold as bridal gloves, and we
found three companies that carry them. LaCrasia Gloves carries a vast
array of styles, from leather to lace. There is a Web site, but not
all products are listed, so we suggest you call to ask about the
selection ([212] 695-0347, www .wegloveyou.com). OnlyGloves .com
carries matte cotton gloves, in an array of colors, for $26 ([800]
417-9143, www.onlygloves.com). Finale Gloves offers all-cotton and
poly/cotton blends (poly/cotton Shortie gloves, $14). Not everything
is on the Web site, so call for information ([800] 285-5511,
www.finalegloves.com).</TE>

<HD>Strapping Men</HD>
<DH>Guys have stuff too. And some have decided that carrying a
purse is better than having bulging pockets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ADAM TSCHORN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm a typical 21st century male. The pockets of my chinos burst at
the seams, jammed to capacity with a Palm Pilot, cell phone, keys,
wallet and sunglasses. Problem is, due to my unique body shape, every
time I sit down I launch the contents of my pockets like tiny
missiles into the air.</LD>
<LD>   I use a cavernous Gap messenger bag to lug my work to and from the
office, but it doesn't help if I'm going to the movies or out on the
town. For that I need a purse--specifically the vast, wide-open real
estate of my fiancee's handbags.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, it would be easier if I had my own purse, a simple little
number with some zipper pockets and a shoulder strap. But I'm a
red-blooded American male--a guy's guy. I was paying attention when
Jerry Seinfeld spent an episode defending his "European carryall." I
took notice when evangelist Jerry Falwell called Tinky Winky's
sexuality into question because the purple Teletubby carried a purse.</LD>
<TE>   I thought about trying Dockers' new Mobile Pant, which
internalizes extra pockets by moving them down the thigh. Stylish in
the store, yes, but once the pockets are actually filled, all but the
super-svelte look like Barney the dinosaur. Not to mention, you have
to reach three-quarters of the way down your leg to answer your cell
phone.</TE>
<TE>   I found another solution on the Internet. The e-Holster, which
bills itself as "the real man's purse ... a little 'edgy,' a little
'gangsta,' a lot functional," eliminates pockets altogether.
Unfortunately, it also makes you look like you're packing heat on an
FBI stakeout. I imagined the chaos I could cause the next time I
quickly reached for my wallet at an airport or on the freeway. No,
the e-Holster would have to stay on the e-shelf.</TE>
<TE>   During a recent Saturday shopping trip with my fiancee-- who had
declared her latest Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche African-inspired
Mombasa purse strictly off-limits--I took an informal poll to see how
other guys cope and carry.</TE>
<TE>   "I got mine when I moved to Manhattan for three years," said Greg
Little, 36, of the small olive green nylon Manhattan Portage bag
slung diagonally across his chest. "Everybody there has them, because
they don't have cars to put anything in." Little, an L.A. resident
who works in the film industry, does catch some grief. "But I get
away with it a little bit," he said, "because all the messengers in
New York use them."</TE>
<TE>   Eric Stewart, 34, carries his wallet, sunglasses, keys and phone
in a small black Diesel bag, not much bigger than a ham sandwich. "I
carry it all the time. I don't like stuff in my pockets. And smaller
is better because I'm tired of all those bulges," said the L.A.
resident, who works in retail. But it was John Crowley, 31, visiting
from Austin, Texas, who won the purse prize. When asked about the
olive green nylon Parcel bag slung over his shoulder, he pointed to
his friend Karen Mann and said, "It's hers. I've got my sunglasses,
sweater and cell phone in here, and she didn't want to carry it."</TE>
<TE>   A purse makes practical sense. But how do I transition? Do I just
show up at work one day like the guy who goes from bald to a full
head of hair in one weekend, forcing my co-workers to stare and
snigger behind my back?</TE>
<TE>   I could just piggyback on another life change--having kids. Lizzie
Shaw, spokesman for L.A. designer Sarah Shaw, notes that the
company's mid-size black leather Metropolitan bag has found double
duty as a diaper bag. "Women tell me their husbands don't feel like
freaks carrying them around like they would with some wild floral
print thing."</TE>
<TE>   Adding a baby to the mix seems excessive. But Shaw makes a good
point: As long as the bag doesn't look too girlie, I could carry it
with my head held high.</TE>
<TE>   So where does one find a masculine-looking satchel? I turned to my
fiancee's extensive purse collection for a clue. One name stood
out--Kate Spade. Isn't she married to Jack Spade? And didn't I read
somewhere that he had a store full of man sacks?</TE>
<TE>   Apparently there is no real Jack Spade. "I borrowed a little Jack
Welch and some Jack Kerouac, who is an everyman. Jack Spade is anyone
and everyone," said designer Andy Spade (who is, in fact, married to
Kate).</TE>
<TE>   The Jack line has a more masculine look than the Kate line because
it uses heavier fabrics such as Waxwear, canvas and a wool-nylon
blend, he said. And the bags are designed from the inside out with
men in mind. "Men are more organized in terms of their bags. They
demand a lot of compartmentalization for pens and floppies," said
Spade. "I even added a ticket pocket."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe there is hope that I can evolve into a bag-wielding
creature, able to stow the various implements of my daily life neatly
into a gender-appropriate, just-the-right-size bag with the right
heft and feel in the right earth tone. But I still harbor a deep fear
that one day I'll pass a stranger on the street and hear those two
dreaded words--"man purse."</TE>
<TE>   Then it hit me. Scottish men aren't embarrassed about wearing
skirts--they simply call them kilts. And if the traditional fur
sporran worn with a Scottish kilt isn't a man purse, I don't know
what is. Sean Connery's a Scotsman, and he was James Bond.</TE>
<TE>   You can't be more of a guy's guy than that. Guy Ritchie wore a
kilt and a sporran at his wedding to Madonna, and I don't hear
Falwell making hay with that. Maybe the best thing I can do is take
up the bagpipes and apply for dual citizenship.</TE>

<HD>At Sunrise, Summer Casts Its Spell</HD>
<DH>With bells, music, wine and yoga, the Southland celebrates
the longest day of the year</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even before the spa-goers head down Wilshire Boulevard in the
moonlight--angelic realms prepped, Tibetan bells jingling--even
before the living gather at a torch-lighted Hollywood cemetery and
the pagans present offerings to the sun god in Huntington Beach
tonight, we've sensed the heralding solstice of summer.</LD>
<LD>   We've felt the days grow long, the slant of the sun at Chavez
Ravine, the urge to get away. We've noticed the darkening hue of Bing
cherries at the farmers market, the warmth atop the highest local
peaks, the fading gold of California poppies in the foothills. And
we've known that the first day of summer was samba-ing toward us.</LD>
<LD>   Today, on the summer solstice, even France will relax its laws on
outdoor music and throw a festival, allowing--mon dieu!--amateur and
professional musicians to play freely, indoors and out. Such madness
goes back to prehistoric celebrations welcoming the longest day of
the year. Today, in the Northern hemisphere, the solstice occurs at
6:24 a.m. when the sun reaches its farthest point north of the
equator, according to the U.S. Naval Observatory. (On Sunday, the
Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County will have astronomers on
hand to answer questions about the solstice and, presumably, the
North Pole's rakish tilt toward the sun.)</LD>
<TE>   The most famous annual celebration is held at Stonehenge, where
druids, pagans and white (or benevolent) witches greet the sunrise at
the historic stones.</TE>
<TE>   As usual, Southern California will observe the solstice with its
own quirky range of events.</TE>
<TE>   In L.A., singer Connie Stevens will host a "moon walk" from her
Garden Sanctuary spa. Starting at 6 p.m., participants will join in a
fertility dance, yoga and "spiritual giving ceremony," all of which
will set the stage for the walk. Writer Gary Quinn, who is billed as
a "psychic to the stars," will guide the prewalk meditation and
discussion on "connecting [with] and being able to access your angels
every day," said Kristin Gabriel, a spokeswoman for the spa.</TE>
<TE>   Walkers will take off from the spa on Robertson Boulevard to
Wilshire Boulevard with Tibetan bells symbolizing the ancient ritual
of dancing in the moonlight to welcome summer. "Connie Stevens really
believes in drawing energy from the moon," Gabriel said. "She's a
moon bather." The $30 event will be limited to 300 people and include
"strengthening tonics" such as herbal teas and sangria.</TE>
<TE>   The area's pagan events will include a Wiccan ritual at A Krystal
Moon store in Huntington Beach. Practitioners of Wicca--a religion
that celebrates the natural world--welcome anyone who drops by for
"celebration and peace and love, and to learn and experience this
process," said store owner Keith Morrison. Participants traditionally
bring canned food or clothing for donation to local shelters, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The ritual, which begins at 7:30 p.m., will be led by a Wiccan
priest. The priest will cleanse a sacred space, using smoke from a
bundle of dried sage, and "cast a circle," or a protected sphere in
which participants are invited. He then will invoke Wiccan deities
known as the elder dragons of light, who will represent the sun god;
participants will make offerings of cake and wine.</TE>
<TE>   None of the Wiccan practices is related to Satanism, Morrison
said. "It's about creating an energy together because as a whole, we
create more energy than ourselves independently."</TE>
<TE>   At Hollywood Forever Cemetery, comedian Margaret Cho is among the
headliners in a freewheeling solstice celebration that will include
music and readings, said communications consultant Joe Sehee. Cho is
"probably going to do some poetry and whatever she feels like," Sehee
said. "We're just allowing people to have fun and do what they want."</TE>
<TE>   Celebrants are invited to picnic on the lawn before the free
event, which starts at 8 p.m., at the cemetery known for famous
occupants such as Rudolph Valentino, Douglas Fairbanks and Cecil B.
DeMille.</TE>
<TE>   In Calabasas, on the Soka University of America campus, the
California Traditional Music Society will hold its 20th Summer
Solstice Festival. The festival, which runs today though Sunday, is
billed as the "largest participatory folk event of its kind" in the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Performers will play music from Appalachian, Celtic, Andean and
other traditions, and workshops will be offered in storytelling,
crafts and international dance. More than 5,000 people are expected
to attend the gathering, including campers with permits who can
participate in potluck dinners, morning tai chi and late-night song
circles. For ticket information: (818) 817-7756 or
www.ctmsfolkmusic.org.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara's annual Summer Solstice Celebration is the largest
single-day event in that county, typically drawing about 100,000
spectators. The parade begins at noon, starting from Cota Street and
State Street, and ending with a festival at Alameda Park. At the
park, parade drummers and others will form a huge drum circle.</TE>
<TE>   For the last six weeks, artists have helped community members put
together the floats, masks, costumes and giant puppets, said Claudia
Bratton, the event's executive director. "I think it's going to be an
opportunity for people to forget their worries and celebrate life,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   And if you don't get around to celebrating (remember, as
Shakespeare wrote, "summer's lease hath all too short a date"),
there's always Sept. 23: the autumnal equinox.</TE>

<HD>The Crossword Puzzle Present</HD>
<DH>Part 5.  The story so far: Rachel and Matt are getting
closer to finishing the puzzle so they will know what things they
need to go with Uncle Don's surprise present. Here's what they've
solved: 4 across, "bowls"; 1 down, "crateorbox"; 3 across, "clock"; 2
down, "brush."</DH>

<LD>Rachel and Matt have solved all but one of the five clues in the
crossword puzzle that Uncle Don sent them. They have a feeling that
special bowls are needed. And Matt knows he's heard something about a
ticking clock. But they still don't know what the present is going to
be.</LD>
<LD>   "Brush," Matt said, reading what his sister, Rachel, had printed
in the crossword puzzle. "It must be a special kind, or he wouldn't
have put it in the puzzle."</LD>
<LD>   "Maybe when we solve the last clue it will tell us," Rachel said.
She picked up the crossword puzzle and read the answers she had
printed in the spaces. "Bowls, crate or box, clock and brush." Then
she said, "Before we do the last clue, I'm going to make the collar
for my pipe-cleaner dog."</LD>
<TE>   Rachel got crayons, paper and a tube of glue. She cut a very small
piece of paper to go around the dog's neck. Then she took her purple
crayon and made a lightning design on the paper.</TE>
<TE>   "Why did you make a lightning design?" Matt asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Because it's easy to draw," Rachel answered. Then she said,
"There! The collar is finished."</TE>
<TE>   And she wrapped it around the neck of her pipe-cleaner dog and
glued the ends together.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks terrific, Rachel," Matt said.</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks," Rachel said.</TE>
<TE>   "Now let's finish the puzzle," Matt said.</TE>
<TE>   "All right," Rachel said.</TE>
<TE>   She pulled the crossword puzzle toward her and picked up the
pencil.</TE>
<TE>   "Ready?" asked Matt.</TE>
<TE>   Rachel nodded.</TE>
<TE>   "Last clue," Matt said. "No. 1 across. It fits around the neck of
the present."</TE>
<TE>   Rachel looked at the puzzle. The answer started with a "C." She
thought for a moment. She looked at her pipe-cleaner dog. She counted
the puzzle spaces.</TE>
<TE>   "Matt!" she said. "I know what the answer is! And I bet I know
what our present is!"</TE>
<TE>   And she told Matt what she had figured out.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you're right, Rachel!" Matt said.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Uncle Don got to their house on Saturday, Rachel and
Matt had everything ready for their present.</TE>
<TE>   Before Uncle Don could even say hello, Matt said, "We solved the
puzzle!"</TE>
<TE>   "And we think we know what the present is," said Rachel.</TE>
<TE>   Uncle Don smiled. "I thought you might," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And he took the present out from under his jacket and handed it to
Rachel.</TE>
<TE>   Rachel and Matt couldn't stop smiling as they played with their
new puppy.</TE>
<TE>   Answers to puzzle: 4 across, "bowls"; 1 down, "crateorbox"; 3
across, "clock"; 2 down, "brush"; 1 across, "collar."</TE>

<TE>   Sue Alexander's fascination with crossword puzzles stems from a
love of words. She's been known to read the dictionary for pure
enjoyment. This story will be on The Times' Web site at
www.latimes.com/kids. A new five-part story begins on Monday.</TE>

versus earlier guidance of between $2.10 and $2.22.</LD>
<LD>   "We're not broken," Chief Executive Julia A. Stewart said. "We're
taking a proactive approach in our efforts to take [the company] to
the next level."</LD>
<TE>   International consulting firm Mars &amp; Co. has been hired to help
the company evaluate current businesses and develop a long-term

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unocal Corp. said it plans to fire 200 workers in Texas, or about 7%
of its U.S. work force, and sell some less-profitable oil and natural
gas properties as part of a reorganization of its Gulf Coast
operations.</LD>
<LD>   The plan will cut costs by $20 million a year and result in
expenses of $12 million for this quarter, the El Segundo-based
company said.</LD>
<LD>   Unocal last year began shifting its exploration focus from
shallower basins in the Gulf of Mexico, where production has waned,
to deeper gas deposits on the continental shelf.</LD>
<TE>   Unocal shares closed up 9 cents at $36.64 on the New York Stock
Exchange before the news was announced.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Tenet Healthcare Corp., the nation's second-largest hospital chain,
lost its bid to acquire Baptist Health System, a financially troubled
nonprofit organization that operates five hospitals in San Antonio.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Barbara-based Tenet had partnered with Christus Santa Rosa
Health Care to take control of the chain, which would have expanded
Tenet's holdings in Texas to 19 hospitals. But Baptist Health said it
chose a proposal by Vanguard Health Systems Inc., a for-profit
company based in Nashville with 10 hospitals, including three in
Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   Tenet said it would pursue other opportunities in south Texas.
Terms of the proposals were not disclosed.</LD>

<HD>Calpine Notes Earnings 'Challenge'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Calpine Corp., a power producer with plants in 29 states, faces "a
challenge" to meet its 2002 profit forecast because of lower margins,
Chief Operating Officer James Macias said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "We would need to see movements on the spark spreads," a measure
of profit from producing power from natural gas, for the company to
meet projections of $1.50 to $1.60 a share this year, Macias said at
an industry conference.</LD>
<LD>   The news sent Calpine shares down $1.02, or $12%, to $7.78 on the
New York Stock Exchange. Shares of the San Jose-based company have
declined 80% in the last year as the weak economy reduced demand for
electricity. Energy stocks also have fallen after the collapse of
Enron Corp.</LD>
<TE>   Calpine has slashed capital spending for 2002 and 2003 by $3
billion, sold shares and paid off $953 million in debt since December
to fortify its balance sheet.</TE>
<TE>   The stock decline is "an overreaction," said Shelly Meyers, who
manages about $50 million at Meyers Capital Management, including
Calpine shares. "I think they'll only make $1.20 a share, but they
will be making real money. The market is reacting more to passion and
emotion than reason."</TE>
<TE>   Macias said Calpine might provide another forecast on 2002 profit
in its second-quarter earnings announcement, due about Aug. 1. The
company was expected to earn $1.49 a share this year, according to
Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Earnings "are difficult to assess now," said Chris Budzynski,
analyst at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. "It's dependent on a number of
variables, the two biggest being the weather and the economy. If you
get hot weather and economic improvements, you could run into
problems with supply in some parts of the country and have higher
prices."</TE>
<TE>   Budzynski rates Calpine's stock a "buy" and doesn't own its
shares.</TE>
<TE>   Calpine has been seeking a partner to back energy transactions
after Moody's Investors Service cut the company's credit rating to
"junk" status in December.</TE>

<HD>Analysts Lowering Disney Forecasts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some analysts are lowering their outlook for Walt Disney Co. because
of poor film results, fewer international tourists visiting its theme
parks and exposure to the financial woes of Adelphia Communications
Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Media analyst Jessica Reif Cohen of Merrill Lynch said Thursday
that she lowered her operating income estimate for Disney's fiscal
third quarter, ending this month, by $50 million, to $830 million,
and her per-share earnings estimate from 20 cents to 17 cents. For
the year, Cohen cut her earnings estimate from 65 cents to 61 cents.</LD>
<LD>   The report helped push down Disney shares to a seven-month low.
The shares Thursday lost $1.30 to close at $19.56 on the New York
Stock Exchange amid a broad decline in the market as investors
reacted to concerns about a slowdown in consumer spending.</LD>
<TE>   Cohen cited mostly unforeseen items, including debt problems of
Adelphia and the bankruptcy of Germany's KirchMedia--both major
Disney customers. Losses from Adelphia could cost Disney about $50
million.</TE>
<TE>   Also hurting Disney this quarter is the poor performance of "Bad
Company," the Jerry Bruckheimer movie starring Anthony Hopkins and
Chris Rock.</TE>
<TE>   It cost more than $100 million in production and marketing and has
generated only $24 million at the box office since its June 7
release.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing I can attribute it to is that it's a highly
competitive marketplace this summer," said Paul Dergarabedian,
president of Exhibitor Relations Co., an Encino-based box office
tracking firm.</TE>
<TE>   The studio is expected to get a lift, however, from its animated
feature "Lilo &amp; Stitch," which premieres today.</TE>
<TE>   Several other analysts have lowered their outlook on Disney in
recent weeks, including Jordan Rohan of SoundView Technology Group,
who cut his third-quarter estimate for Disney to 15 cents from 20
cents and his yearly projection to 55 cents from 66 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Also hurting Disney, Rohan said, is a ratings slide at
Disney-owned TV network ABC and a dip in theme park attendance.</TE>

<HD>Dollar's Fall Could Help Lift Blue Chips</HD>
<DH>Currencies: Many U.S. companies with significant overseas
operations would benefit if slide continues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For U.S. blue-chip stocks, the slumping dollar appears to be that
rarest of commodities these days: good news.</LD>
<LD>   So far, the dollar's fall--which deepened on Thursday, with the
greenback hitting a two-year low against the euro--isn't offsetting
other negatives that are dragging share prices lower.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, Wall Street fell sharply again Thursday, pushing key
indexes to eight-month lows.</LD>
<TE>   But the stock market's bulls say the dollar is one trend that is
going in the right direction.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's Corp., the world's largest restaurant chain, said this
week that its second-quarter profit would climb after six straight
quarterly declines, in large part because of the strength of the
euro, which has rallied about 10% against the dollar since early
April.</TE>
<TE>   Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., meanwhile, this week raised its
second-quarter profit forecast, citing cost-cutting moves but also
noting that the stronger euro would give a modest boost to the bottom
line.</TE>
<TE>   "We're likely to hear more favorable comments, especially from the
big companies," said Gary Thayer, an economist at brokerage A.G.
Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   When the dollar weakens, U.S. firms with overseas operations can
automatically benefit as foreign income translates into more dollars.
In addition, U.S. companies that export products have the flexibility
to cut prices, which may make them more competitive with foreign
rivals, or to keep prices the same in dollar terms, which gives them
more foreign currency in return.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, a strong dollar--which has been the norm since
1998--is a drag on U.S. companies' foreign results.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar's reversal this year against key currencies has been
blamed on factors including concern about U.S. accounting standards,
worries about the economic recovery and jitters over the massive U.S.
trade deficit, which ballooned to a record $35.9 billion in April, a
report Thursday showed.</TE>
<TE>   All of those issues have tarnished the dollar's image as the
world's dominant currency and have made foreigners less interested in
investing in U.S. assets, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   The trade deficit report triggered another surge in the euro
Thursday, lifting its value to a two-year high of 96.5 cents from
95.7 cents Wednesday. The dollar also has tumbled this year against
the British pound, the Australian dollar and the Japanese yen, among
others.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar may be only "about halfway through" its downtrend, said
economist Thayer, who believes it remains overvalued relative to
other major currencies.</TE>
<TE>   In a report Thursday, mutual fund firm Putnam Investments said the
euro probably would continue to be the main beneficiary of the
dollar's weakness--not just because of optimism about Europe's
prospects for an economic rebound, but also because the euro is seen
as the leading alternative to the dollar as a store of value for
global investors.</TE>
<TE>   If the dollar's slide continues, consumer-oriented multinational
companies such as McDonald's, Procter &amp; Gamble Co., Coca-Cola Co. and
Colgate-Palmolive Co. could get a substantial profit bump in the
second half of the year, said Chuck Hill, research director at
Boston-based earnings tracker Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   "They got hurt back in 1998 when the dollar strengthened. Now it's
working the other way," Hill said.</TE>
<TE>   A falling dollar typically works to the advantage of larger
companies over smaller ones, because big firms are more likely to do
significant business overseas. In the blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index, for example, about 26% of total company revenue comes from
foreign markets. In sectors such as technology, energy, basic
materials and consumer staples (toiletries, food and so forth), that
percentage is even higher.</TE>
<TE>   But changes in currency values can affect any company that exports
products or does a lot of business abroad, including some small and
mid-size firms. Examples include Tupperware Corp., Dole Food Co., BE
Aerospace Inc. and packaging maker Chesapeake Corp., each of which
does more than half its business abroad, according to brokerage
Salomon Smith Barney (the firm does not necessarily recommend those
stocks, however).</TE>
<TE>   On the flip side, some major companies that have hefty foreign
sales may not necessarily reap big benefits from currency swings.
Hill notes that many companies hedge against currency fluctuations
through trading strategies that can minimize the effect of dollar
changes, good and bad.</TE>
<TE>   Also, not all companies will be affected by the dollar's slide as
quickly as a "cash-and-carry business" such as McDonald's, said Sung
Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo &amp; Co. in Minneapolis.
Companies that make big-ticket goods, such as Caterpillar Inc., may
get more of a delayed benefit, Sohn said, because shipping, billing
and other steps take time.</TE>
<TE>   Still, after seven years of a mostly upward trend, a decline in
the dollar is probably positive for U.S. companies and, eventually,
for the stock market, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   There are major risks, however.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. economist William Dudley noted in a report
last week that the 1985-88 experience illustrated how a falling
dollar can worsen the U.S. economic climate in the near term. After
peaking in March 1985, the dollar began a three-year slide that
destabilized U.S. markets, helping to fuel a spike in Treasury bond
yields that was one trigger for the 1987 stock market crash.</TE>
<TE>   This time around, a continuing drop in the dollar could make
foreign investors increasingly reluctant to own dollar-denominated
stocks and bonds, analysts say. If that begets wholesale dumping of
U.S. assets, the immediate effect on Wall Street may be more of the
same--falling share prices.</TE>
<TE>   For U.S. consumers, there may be a downside as well, Thayer said:
Imported products such as apparel and electronics can become more
expensive as the dollar weakens. Also, U.S. firms could have more
leeway to raise prices domestically if prices of foreign goods rise.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, any overseas vacations Americans are planning are
becoming more costly by the day.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft, Verizon to Form DSL Venture</HD>
<DH>Telecommunications: Alliance provides edge over AOL in
battle for broadband customers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. and Verizon Communications Inc., the biggest U.S.
telephone company, said Thursday that they will launch a co-branded
high-speed version of the software giant's MSN online service.</LD>
<LD>   The digital subscriber line broadband service, to be built on
Verizon's network using phone lines to deliver high-speed Internet
access, will be launched next spring.</LD>
<LD>   It will offer customers a portal with exclusive broadband content,
the companies said.</LD>
<TE>   The deal gives MSN, which operates both as a Web portal and an
Internet dial-up service, a foothold in the growing market for
broadband access while rival AOL Time Warner Inc. struggles to
provide a competing broadband offering to prevent customers from
switching to alternative services.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the right way to do it and put it together," said
Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer.</TE>
<TE>   Through the deal, Microsoft hopes to boost its 7.7 million MSN
users by tapping into Verizon's DSL user base of 1.4 million, with
capacity to serve 34 million.</TE>
<TE>   MSN, which also has a similar agreement with Qwest Communications
International Inc. to jointly market MSN and Qwest's narrow-band
dial-up and broadband access services, now will market Verizon as its
preferred broadband provider.</TE>
<TE>   The MSN-Verizon announcement came during the same week that
Qwest's CEO was ousted and replaced as investor concern mounted about
its heavy debt load and its accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   New York-based Verizon also will sell MSN as the preferred portal
and service provider, and either company will charge customers for
the co-branded service, which is expected to cost between $39.95 and
$49.95.</TE>
<TE>   Verizon CEO Ivan Seidenberg said he was not concerned about the
risk of MSN and Microsoft Windows' features, such as instant
messaging, Internet phone and video chatting, cannibalizing Verizon's
conventional phone services.</TE>
<TE>   "In the same way that wireless has turned out a be a substitute
for certain land-line services, we need to create new sources of
growth with broadband," Seidenberg told Reuters.</TE>
<TE>   Ballmer said he thought such messaging and videoconferencing
features would be the "killer application" for broadband services
rather than premium content such as sports and entertainment delivery
via the MSN portal.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft and Verizon said they will share revenue in the
alliance, but declined to disclose details.</TE>
<TE>   The alliance marks the latest development in a string of marriages
between Web content providers and telecommunications infrastructure
providers.</TE>
<TE>   Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft has been forging deals with
cable-based broadband providers to provide a high-speed Internet
platform for MSN. AOL Time Warner also has been seeking to ally with
cable partners to beef up AOL Broadband.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft shares fell 26 cents to $54.10 on Nasdaq. Verizon gained

<HD>Dynegy Pulls Plug on Web Trading Unit</HD>
<DH>Energy: Company's decision delivers another blow to an
industry that is still feeling the effects of the fall of Enron.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dynegy Inc. closed its Internet energy-trading operation Thursday,
further shrinking the shell-shocked industry in the wake of several
trading scandals and the collapse of Enron Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Dynegy pulled the plug on DynegyDirect a day after the parent
company laid off 340 workers, or 6% of its work force, and replaced
Chief Financial Officer Rob Doty. Dynegy told customers to contact
its Houston energy traders by telephone if they want to buy or sell
electricity, natural gas or coal.</LD>
<LD>   "It certainly is a bad omen for the sector, for earnings and for
future volatility," said Chris Ellinghaus, an analyst with Williams
Capital in New York. "Enron has killed the industry, killed the
market, killed the companies and killed many executive careers."</LD>
<TE>   The loss of DynegyDirect, which Dynegy said was temporary and was
prompted by an industry credit crunch, could reduce liquidity and
increase volatility in energy markets, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   And it represents another blow to the Houston energy company,
whose chief executive, Chuck Watson, resigned abruptly last month
after the Securities and Exchange Commission announced it was
investigating a gas deal designed to reduce Dynegy's tax bill and the
company said it had participated in "wash" trades. In such trades,
the same amount of energy is exchanged with another trader at the
same price; critics say they are nothing more than sham trades to
drive up trading volumes or influence energy price indexes.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy's stock slipped 21 cents to $7.50 on the New York Stock
Exchange. Dynegy's news helped pull down other energy merchants,
whose stock has been hammered in recent months as Enron disintegrated
and traders were implicated in bogus transactions or were accused of
using Enron-like trading ploys during the California energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Hours after the markets closed, Reliant Resources Inc. said the
SEC ordered an investigation into its wash trades and other
transactions that led to a restatement of financial results at the
energy trader and its parent, Reliant Energy Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy's move echoed the travails of Enron, which closed its
market-dominating Internet trading business, EnronOnline, in November
as the company plunged toward Bankruptcy Court. Enron sold its
trading business to UBS Warburg, which has since opened an Internet
version.</TE>
<TE>   No one is saying Dynegy, which tried to buy Enron last year for $9
billion, is headed down Enron's road to ruin.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, analysts said, Dynegy is trying to conserve cash as it
overhauls its operations in the face of the diminishing trading
industry. Dynegy is scheduled to unveil details of a restructuring
plan Monday, and asset sales are widely expected as Dynegy struggles
to keep an investment-grade rating on its debt.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy spokesman David Byford said the company opened DynegyDirect
in November 2000 for the convenience of its customers, but still did
most of its trading by telephone. Dynegy will continue to trade that
way and through another Internet operation, TradeSpark, in which it
is a partner.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to reactivate DynegyDirect when the market stabilizes
and trading demand justifies the service," Byford said. Dynegy is
closing the Internet operation because of "market developments and
the poor credit environment in the industry," he said.</TE>
<TE>   DynegyDirect operated as EnronOnline did, serving as a "market
maker" so Dynegy was the counter party to every trade. When
EnronOnline failed, customers became leery of that market structure
and many took their business to exchanges that use a "many-to-many"
model, bringing buyers and sellers together, said Mike Wilczek,
markets editor at Platts energy information service, a division of
McGraw-Hill Cos.</TE>
<TE>   "DynegyDirect probably was just not worth the trouble anymore" for
Dynegy, which never enjoyed the volume of business that EnronOnline
did, Wilczek said.</TE>
<TE>   Other online trading operations remain, including Houston-based
TradeSpark, Atlanta-based Intercontinental Exchange and Bloomberg
PowerMatch.</TE>
<TE>   Ellinghaus said the shrinking trading business has particularly
hurt liquidity in forward markets for energy to be delivered in a
year or 18 months, which reduces the ability of companies to protect
themselves against price movements.</TE>

<HD>Indicators Up 0.4% in May</HD>
<DH>Economy: The rise is greater than expected. Trade gap hits
a record $35.9 billion in April, reflecting higher oil prices and
demand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. index of leading economic indicators rose twice as much as
expected during May, and the trade deficit swelled to a record in
April as imports rose to meet expected consumer demand, government
reports showed Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The Conference Board's measure of likely economic conditions in
three to six months rose 0.4% after a 0.3% decline in April.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not a question anymore of whether the economy is in recovery
but how strong it's going to be," said Greg Mount, an economist at
Bank One Corp. in Chicago.</LD>
<TE>   Five of the 10 indicators the New York-based Conference Board uses
to calculate the monthly index pushed it higher and four were
negative.</TE>
<TE>   Growth was suggested by measures of money supply, jobless claims,
building permits, consumer expectations and vendor ability to keep up
with orders.</TE>
<TE>   A drop in stock prices, fewer orders for consumer goods and
non-defense capital goods and a narrower spread between the yield on
10-year Treasury notes and the Fed's benchmark overnight rate limited
the increase.</TE>
<TE>   The Conference Board's index of coincident indicators, a gauge of
current economic activity, rose 0.1% in May after being unchanged in
April. The index of lagging indicators fell 0.2% last month, after a
0.5% drop a month earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The $35.9-billion imbalance between imports and exports of goods
and services followed a $32.5-billion trade gap in March, the
Commerce Department said. The current account deficit, a wider
measure that includes investments, grew to a record $112.5 billion in
the first three months of the year.</TE>
<TE>   The trade deficit reflected higher oil prices as well as consumer
demand.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. imported 303 million barrels in April, compared with 267
million a month earlier. The price per barrel rose to $22.48 from
$19.18.</TE>
<TE>   Imports of consumer goods rose 5.4% to a record $24.9 billion
because of increased demand for automobiles, clothing, televisions
and toys.</TE>
<TE>   Exports rose 2.2% to $80.1 billion, led by shipments of chemicals,
industrial machinery and semiconductors.</TE>
<TE>   The gap in the current account balance grew from a revised $95.1
billion in the fourth quarter of 2001, the Commerce Department said.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second consecutive increase.</TE>
<TE>   The growing imbalance in current accounts has raised worries among
government officials and economists that foreign investors may pull
money out of the U.S. The dollar fell to a two-year low against the
euro after the trade reports.</TE>
<TE>   A separate report Thursday showed job losses may be slowing as the
economy picks up. Initial applications for state unemployment
benefits fell by 2,000 last week to 393,000, the Labor Department
said.</TE>

<HD>Panel to Offer Corporate Governance Guidelines</HD>
<DH>Investing: Conference Board group will tackle compensation,
auditing and other issues to help restore confidence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The Conference Board climbed on the bandwagon Thursday to restore
confidence in corporate America, assembling a blue-chip panel to
issue guidelines on thorny issues such as stock options.</LD>
<LD>   But whether the influential research group's 15-member
panel--boasting the likes of former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker, Vanguard Group founder John Bogle and former Johnson &amp;
Johnson Chairman Ralph Larsen--will be able to sway corporate
behavior is up for debate.</LD>
<LD>   The panel is one of several that have cropped up in recent months
in response to rapidly deteriorating investor confidence after a
string of corporate scandals that have engulfed financial markets.</LD>
<TE>   "Our intention is not to duplicate what others have done," John
Snow, chairman of U.S. rail giant CSX Corp. and co-chairman of the
panel, told reporters at a news conference. "Our intention is to take
a broad perspective on what has gone wrong."</TE>
<TE>   The panel--to be called the Commission on Public Trust and Private
Enterprise--said it would tackle a wide range of issues, including
auditing and accounting standards, executive compensation and
relations between corporate management and boards.</TE>
<TE>   But by its own admission, the group has no power to enforce the
guidelines it creates. Instead, it is banking on "moral suasion" for
its efforts to bear fruit.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they may be a little bit behind the curve when it comes
to this," said Ralph Ward, publisher of the newsletter Boardroom
Insider, which deals mainly with corporate governance and boardroom
issues.</TE>
<TE>   Panel co-Chairman Peter Peterson, former U.S. secretary of
Commerce and current chairman of investment firm Blackstone Group, is
optimistic nevertheless.</TE>
<TE>   He said the panel already had the support of a few companies that
he declined to identify.</TE>
<TE>   The group is expected to deliver recommendations by October.</TE>
<TE>   NYSE Short Interest Surges to Record High</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street's bears appear to have dramatically increased their
bets on lower stock prices.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Stock Exchange said Thursday that "short
interest"--the number of NYSE-listed shares borrowed and sold,
usually in a bet that prices will drop--soared 7.5% in the four weeks
ended June 14.</TE>
<TE>   The total number of shorted shares stood at a record 7.2 billion
on June 14, compared with 6.7 billion on May 15.</TE>
<TE>   In a short sale a trader borrows stock (usually from a brokerage)
and sells it, pocketing the proceeds. If the stock's market price
declines, the trader can buy back the shares later to replace the
loaned stock. The net profit would be the difference between the sale
price and the stock's repurchase price.</TE>
<TE>   But short sellers bear considerable risk: If a stock's price rises
rather than declines, a short sale can result in unlimited losses
until the transaction finally is closed out.</TE>
<TE>   A surge in short sales in two stocks--Lucent Technologies and
Nortel Networks--accounted for a major share of the increase in NYSE
short sales between mid-May and mid-June, NYSE data show.</TE>
<TE>   The number of shorted Lucent shares rose to 367 million from 262
million; the number of shorted Nortel shares rose to 330 million from
133 million.</TE>
<TE>   Lucent shares closed Thursday at a multi-year low of $2.42. .
Nortel stock closed at $1.70 Thursday, down from $2.74 in mid-May.</TE>

<HD>Korn/Ferry Posts Loss as Revenue Falls</HD>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Korn/Ferry International Inc., the world's largest executive search
firm, Thursday reported a fiscal fourth-quarter loss as revenue
plunged and said results in the first quarter might be worse than
analysts expect.</LD>
<LD>   The weakened economy in North America and Europe and recent
corporate scandals hurt revenue in Korn/Ferry's executive and
middle-management recruiting segments as clients put hiring decisions
on hold, the company said.</LD>
<LD>   The company posted a net loss of $13.3 million, or 35 cents a
share, for the quarter ended April 30, contrasted with net income of
$8 million, or 21 cents, a year ago.</LD>
<TE>   Excluding one-time charges, Korn/Ferry's loss was 12 cents a
share, a penny better than the 13-cent loss expected, compared with a
loss of 7 cents a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue dropped 38% to $90.1 million. Executive recruiting revenue
dropped 35% to $81.1 million. Revenue at Futurestep, Korn/Ferry's
middle-management segment, plunged 51% to $8.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   For the first quarter, the company said per-share results will
range from break-even to a loss of 6 cents. Analysts on average
forecast a loss of 2 cents, according to Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Los Angeles-based Korn/Ferry fell 13 cents to $9.02 on

<HD>Levi Reports Loss in Quarter</HD>
<DH>Apparel: The results reflect costs associated with closing
eight plants and continued slow sales.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Levi Strauss &amp; Co., maker of Levi's jeans and Dockers slacks,
reported a net loss for the second quarter because of costs involved
in closing eight manufacturing plants and continuing lower sales.</LD>
<LD>   The net loss of $80.9 million, which contrasted with net income of
$43.4 million a year ago, came as the company struggles to restore
its faded image after more youth-oriented brands cut into its
once-dominant market share. Excluding the one-time restructuring
charges, profit fell 65% to $15 million.</LD>
<LD>   Sales at Levi Strauss, one of the world's largest apparel
companies, fell 12% to $923.5 million, led by weakness in Europe amid
stiff competition from lower-priced jeans. Sales growth in Asia
offered a sign of encouragement, the company said.</LD>
<TE>   Chief Executive Phil Marineau said Levi Strauss had expected a
rough quarter but is optimistic that its turnaround plan would mean
better sales in the second half of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "The quarter results reflect many of the initiatives that put us
in a position to be more competitive than we have been in years,"
Marineau said. "As we go forward, sales will stabilize and begin to
grow in 2003."</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts, however, were less certain that Levi could meet its
targets given the tough retail environment.</TE>
<TE>   Since sales started sliding in 1997, Levi has shut 30 plants in
North America and seven in Europe, cut more than 18,000 jobs and
sought to transform itself into a marketer from an apparel
manufacturer.</TE>
<TE>   These figures include factory closures announced this year,
although some will operate through September.</TE>
<TE>   Levi promised a revamped product line-up, including its own
lower-priced jeans and Dockers khakis in Europe and a jeans line in
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Marineau also said Levi would kick off an advertising blitz for
new khaki pants he described as a "stain defender" that protects even
against red wine spills.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco-based Levi is a private company but releases
financial results because its debt is registered with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   It had $1.86 billion of debt at the end of May, down from $1.96
billion at the end of fiscal 2001.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Drop Again Despite Positive Data</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: The Dow loses 1.4% and Nasdaq slides 2.1% amid
fears of Mideast violence. Indexes near 2001 lows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Strong economic reports Thursday couldn't overcome a tumbling dollar
and more fears about Mideast violence, with the result that Wall
Street suffered another broad decline.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 129.8 points, or 1.4%, to
9,431.77, its lowest since Nov. 2, while the Nasdaq composite index
dropped 32.08 points, or 2.1%, to 1,464.75, its lowest since Sept.
27.</LD>
<LD>   "There's no confidence among investors, and it shows, because you
get one up day and then you give it back again over the next couple,"
said Robert Froehlich, chief investment strategist for Deutsche Asset
Management. "Two years ago, everywhere you looked there was a reason
to invest. Today, everywhere you look there is a reason not to
invest."</LD>
<TE>   The market's continuing slide is taking key indexes ever closer to
the three-year lows they reached Sept. 21, in the aftermath of the
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite stands 3% above its Sept. 21 low of 1,423,
and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500, at 1,006.29 on Thursday, is 4.1% above
its Sept. 21 low of about 966. The Dow is 15% above its Sept. 21 low
of 8,235.</TE>
<TE>   If the indexes drop to new lows it would suggest the 2-year-old
bear market is beginning a new phase.</TE>
<TE>   A bigger-than-expected increase in the index of leading economic
indicators, reported Thursday, was expected to buoy investors'
confidence in the economy. But after trading modestly lower for much
of the session, stocks slumped in the final hour.</TE>
<TE>   Losers topped winners by 18 to 14 on the New York Stock Exchange
and by 19 to 15 on Nasdaq. Trading was active.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts cited Mideast worries and the dollar's latest dive,
triggered by news that the U.S. trade deficit ballooned in April.</TE>
<TE>   The euro's value surged to a two-year high of 96.5 cents from 95.7
cents Wednesday. The dollar also fell to 123.37 yen from 123.82.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar's slide raises concerns that more foreign investors
will bail out of U.S. assets because each drop in the currency
devalues their U.S. holdings.</TE>
<TE>   Concerns about Brazil also may have weighed on Wall Street. The
main Brazilian stock index plunged 5.1% to 10,908, and the
government's debt slumped in value after Moody's Investors Service
lowered Brazil's foreign-currency debt rating outlook to "negative"
from "stable," citing an erosion of investor confidence. A new poll
showed the leftist presidential candidate maintained his large lead
with voters.</TE>
<TE>   Investors also dumped U.S. Treasury bonds, halting a strong rally
of the last few weeks. The yield on the 10-year T-note jumped to
4.79% from 4.73%.</TE>
<TE>   Gold returned to favor, with near-term futures rising $3.40 to
$323.20 an ounce in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Among Thursday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Auto stocks slid after brokerage Morgan Stanley warned that
weakening sales may crimp earnings growth. GM fell $2.59 to $53.75,
Ford lost 75 cents to $15.73, and DaimlerChrysler was off $1.17 to
$43.98.</TE>
<TE>   Among auto parts firms, Superior Industries lost $1.67 to $43.63,
and Borg Warner fell $1.84 to $58.31.</TE>
<TE>   * Genzyme led biotech shares lower, falling $6.17 to $19.70 after
the firm cut its full-year earnings estimate because of slower sales
of a kidney disease drug.</TE>
<TE>   * Semiconductor stocks continued to lose ground, dragging the tech
sector lower. Intel fell 85 cents to $19.24, and Micron Technology
dropped $1.68 to $18.40.</TE>
<TE>   * On the plus side, Mattel rose 7 cents to a 52-week high of
$21.84 after Zacks Investment Research recommended the toy maker.</TE>
<TE>   Also, home builders' shares rallied anew in the wake of strong
housing-sector data this week. Centex rose $1.44 to $58, and Lennar
gained $2.37 to $61.55.</TE>

<DH>Hospitals: Cedars- Sinai, UCLA and Kaiser are renovating,
expanding facilities to adapt to changing care, future patient needs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the grounds of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, hard
hats and tool belts have become as common a sight as surgical masks
and stethoscopes as the prestigious medical facility undergoes an
extensive renovation and expansion.</LD>
<LD>   Construction activity at Cedars-Sinai and other area medical
complexes is partly to meet more stringent government seismic safety
standards, but also to adapt to new technology and changes in
health-care practices. Upgrading medical facilities is costly and
complicated and, in the case of nearly century-old Cedars-Sinai, will
take more than a decade and about $620 million to complete.</LD>
<LD>   Rebuilding requires medical officials to gamble hundreds of
millions of dollars on future demand for hospital services, the
emergence of new treatments and other health-care trends. A losing
bet could prove costly, perhaps saddling a hospital with too many
empty beds or too little space for outpatient services.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a challenging environment because medicine is changing so
quickly and technology is changing so quickly," said John Law,
Cedars-Sinai building committee chairman.</TE>
<TE>   In many cases, new construction will not create a significant
increase in hospital beds. In east Hollywood, for example, the
$500-million overhaul of Kaiser Permanente's Los Angeles Medical
Center on Sunset Boulevard at Vermont Avenue will reduce the number
of beds by about 10% to about 450 but increase the number of
operating and delivery rooms, said spokeswoman Roberta Tinajero. The
project includes a new outpatient surgery center and is scheduled to
be completed this year.</TE>
<TE>   New facilities boast features that hospital officials say will
make stays more comfortable for patients and their families. At UCLA,
an $800-million medical center designed by noted architect I.M. Pei
will include more single-patient rooms, larger windows and daybeds
for guests. Patients and staff were involved in planning the complex,
scheduled to open in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   "In the midst of all this high technology and dealing with very
ill patients, we are trying to make the hospital a more humane and a
more pleasant place to be," said Gerald S. Levey, UCLA Medical
Sciences provost.</TE>
<TE>   At Cedars-Sinai, one of Southern California's largest and
best-known medical centers, officials have been planning the current
expansion and renovation since the early 1990s. Those plans expanded
in size and scope when the 1994 Northridge earthquake prompted state
officials to beef up seismic safety standards for hospitals. In fact,
the earthquake struck on the day Thomas M. Priselac assumed the job
as president of Cedars-Sinai.</TE>
<TE>   Priselac and other employees have worked countless hours on the
hospital's most extensive construction effort since the 1970s and one
that will eventually involve nearly every building on Cedars-Sinai's
24-acre campus on Los Angeles' Westside.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to seismic retrofits of existing structures, the
construction project will produce four new structures, including a
150-bed hospital tower, a diagnostic and treatment center, an
expanded central plant and the $83-million S. Mark Taper Foundation
Imaging Center &amp; Department, a 125,000-square-foot facility scheduled
to open in October.</TE>
<TE>   The program will expand the hospital's capacity beyond 1,000 beds
and allow staff to increase the number of annual surgeries to 30,000
from 18,000.</TE>
<TE>   Planning and design for the buildings taking shape at Cedars-Sinai
reflect input from a wide range of hospital staff and patients. The
building committee, for example, has 25 members. The process is "much
more inclusive" than it was in earlier expansions, Priselac said.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital officials also spent much time trying to identify trends
that will influence future demand for rooms and treatment. Among them
is the advancing age of a large segment of the population.</TE>
<TE>   As baby boomers move into their 60s and beyond, the "near-term
results are increased incidents of orthopedic [problems]," Priselac
said, "but in the future, cancer and cardiac disease become more
common."</TE>
<TE>   Cedars-Sinai planners also determined that new buildings would
have to be more efficient and flexible than older generations of
hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Neurosurgical operating rooms, for example, will include imaging
equipment that will allow medical staff to conduct an MRI scan on the
spot instead of having to transport patients to a different part of
the hospital and return them to the operating room.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of effort to build facilities that have a lot of
versatility in them far into the future," Priselac said.</TE>

<HD>Bertelsmann, Rapper End Joint Venture</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bertelsmann's music division has ended its joint venture with Sean
"P. Diddy" Combs' Bad Boy record label.</LD>
<LD>   As part of the deal, Combs acquired full ownership of the Bad Boy
label and retains control of the master recordings of its artist
roster, which includes R&amp;B singer Faith Evans, pop act Dream and the
catalog of the late rapper Notorious B.I.G.</LD>
<LD>   Bad Boy's catalog will be sold through Bertelsmann's Arista label
until Combs finds another distribution deal.</LD>
<TE>   In an interview Thursday, Combs said that in seeking ownership of
the Bad Boy catalog, he told Arista chief Antonio "L.A." Reid that
"as far as black history, we usually get the short end of the stick.
I said to L.A., as a black man, when is this opportunity going to
come up again, that someone can, as a young black man, make a run at
being a superpower in this industry? It's just exciting and
exhilarating to me."</TE>
<TE>   Bad Boy scored a handful of successes last year, even as Combs
battled gun possession and bribery charges. His own album "P. Diddy
and Bad Boy Records: We Invented the Remix" debuted at No. 1 on the
Billboard album chart last month and has sold an estimated 706,000
copies since its release.</TE>
<TE>   But the label hasn't regained the market share lost after the
fatal shooting in 1997 of the Notorious B.I.G., whose real name was
Christopher Wallace. Bad Boy has since been losing a reported $25
million a year.</TE>
<TE>   The move comes as Bertelsmann absorbs independent powerhouse Zomba
Music Group, which it is acquiring for $3 billion under an option
exercised by Zomba chief Clive Calder.</TE>

<LD>A bankruptcy judge cleared the way for record companies to pursue a
preliminary injunction against file-sharing service Madster.</LD>
<LD>   Copyright litigation against Madster, formerly known as Aimster,
was automatically stayed in March after bankruptcy filings were made
by Madster founder Johnny Deep and two companies involved in the
service's operations.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Littlefield in Albany, N.Y., lifted
the stay for the limited purpose of allowing record companies to ask
a federal judge in Chicago to decide on a pending preliminary
injunction motion.</LD>
<TE>   Littlefield noted that the record companies do not want to shut
Madster down but want only to stop copyright infringements on the
service.</TE>

<LD>An undercover investigation of work-at-home businesses caught 77
operations suspected of using paid shills and making fraudulent
earnings claims to dupe investors, the Federal Trade Commission said.</LD>
<LD>   Operators of medical billing, envelope stuffing and vending
machine businesses were among those that cheated investors by
overstating potential profits and exaggerating demand, the FTC said.
Some businesses also misrepresented the assistance they would provide
investors in their franchises, said the FTC, which teamed up with the
Justice Department and 17 state law enforcement agencies.</LD>
<LD>   The FTC has filed 11 lawsuits in federal courts seeking permanent
injunctions to halt the scams. The agency said that it had settled
four related cases, and that state law enforcement agencies had
brought 48 cases of their own.</LD>

<LD>A New York state judge said he may void $625 million in lawyers' fees
from New York's $25-billion settlement of litigation with Philip
Morris Cos., RJR Tobacco Holdings Inc. and other tobacco companies.</LD>
<LD>   New York Supreme Court Justice Charles E. Ramos said that he was
"in possession of facts suggesting unethical conduct," and that he
might refer the matter to the state bar committee on discipline.</LD>
<LD>   Ramos did not elaborate but said he might require private
attorneys who represented the state to produce time sheets showing
what they had done to earn their fees, which were authorized in
October by an arbitration panel.</LD>
<TE>   The judge said he might even overturn the state's $25-billion
share of the $206-billion national settlement reached with the
tobacco industry in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Three New York law firms were awarded $281 million in fees in the
case.</TE>

<HD>SEC's Oversight Proposal Derided</HD>
<DH>Regulation: Investor groups say chairman's plan for
accounting board is too lax. Firms say it's too tough.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>NEW YORK -- Government regulators formally proposed the creation of a
new accounting oversight board Thursday, but were immediately
attacked by investor groups that called the plan too lax and
accounting firms that derided it as overbearing.</LD>
<LD>   The plan by Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey
Pitt calls for a nine-member panel to conduct regular exams of the
industry and to impose broad sanctions for wrongdoing.</LD>
<LD>   The current oversight system--in which the industry largely
monitors itself--has been castigated in the aftermath of Enron
Corp.'s collapse as letting firms bend the rules to satisfy audit
clients.</LD>
<TE>   The proposal to create a Public Accountability Board also is a
vital political test for Pitt, who is battling an image that he is
too close to the industry and unwilling to enact meaningful reforms.</TE>
<TE>   The sudden opposition to Pitt's plan may boost the odds that
Congress will have the final say on the issue. The House passed a
bill in April calling for an oversight board, and a key Senate
committee passed a competing measure sponsored by Sen. Paul S.
Sarbanes (D-Md.) this week that is considerably tougher.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt has said he is moving forward in the event that legislation
stalls. Nevertheless, he is lobbying hard, making the rounds of
television business shows Thursday night in search of support.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a milestone in our agency's history," Pitt said of his plan
at the SEC's meeting in Washington. The PAB would be "powerfully able
to address accountants' ethical lapses or competence deficiencies."</TE>
<TE>   The SEC's vote puts the plan out for public comment for 60 days.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt's proposal was generally lauded by investor groups early this
week when its elements first became public. They called it a vast
improvement over Pitt's original proposal in January.</TE>
<TE>   But investor advocates said Thursday that a reading of the fine
print now makes them worry the politically powerful accounting
industry would still wield substantial influence over how it is
regulated.</TE>
<TE>   "While he's billing it as something very tough, when we look at
the details we see he's sticking to his word [in a speech last year]
about being 'kindler and gentler' to the accounting industry," said
Frank Torres, legislative counsel at Consumers Union in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting industry took the opposite position, complaining
that the non-accountants on the board would have too much clout,
while professionals would be relegated to a minor role.</TE>
<TE>   "This proposal seems to suggest that we are becoming bystanders in
the process," said Alan Anderson, senior vice president of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, an industry trade
group.</TE>
<TE>   Some business groups, such as Financial Executives International,
praised Pitt's plan. However, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce expressed
concern that the plan might be too costly and that its reforms might
be excessive.</TE>
<TE>   "If that is an absolute necessity in order to get investors back,
then it's a necessary cost," said Marty Regalia, the chamber's chief
economist. But it could be "just a pure wasted tax on business."</TE>
<TE>   Pitt's plan has some elements that appeal to investor advocates.
It calls for six of the nine board members to be independent--that
is, not associated with the accounting industry. Consumer groups fear
that a board top-heavy with insiders would defer to industry wishes.</TE>
<TE>   The board also could compel accounting firms to produce documents
and provide testimony in disciplinary cases, and it could mete out
penalties ranging from fines to suspensions. Only the six independent
members would vote on such sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   The board would be financed by fees paid by accounting firms and
public companies.</TE>
<TE>   The PAB would replace the Public Oversight Board, which had few
disciplinary powers, among other shortcomings, and recently voted to
disband.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest point of contention, however, is whether the SEC plan
would give the industry a backdoor through which it could wield
excessive influence on the board.</TE>
<TE>   That debate is being waged most sharply over who would set the
standards that auditors follow when reviewing public companies. This
is a key issue because it would dictate the precise guidelines by
which audits are conducted.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt's plan would let the PAB devise its own procedures or accept
those written by the AICPA, as is the case today. Critics say that
leaves intact the current system that led to financial abuses at
Enron and other companies.</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, the industry says the Pitt plan would exclude
accountants from having any input in setting standards, and would
leave it to the six independent board members who might be less
familiar with accounting's complexities.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, opponents worry that Pitt's plan would institutionalize
another problem with the current system: Today, firms review each
other--a system that critics vilify as rife with problems because of
the incentive for accountants to go lightly on one another. Under the
SEC proposal, annual reviews would be led by a PAB staff member. But
the board could hire accounting firms to assist in reviews.</TE>
<TE>   "Why doesn't [the board] hire [in-house] people to do it, and
eliminate the appearance of back-scratching?" asked Barbara Roper of
the Consumer Federation of America.</TE>
<TE>   Critics also chafe at a provision in which all board members other
than the chairman or vice chairman would work only part time. They
say that gives the industry additional leeway to exert influence.</TE>
<TE>   Investor groups say they favor the plan put forth in the Sarbanes
bill. Though similar to Pitt's proposal in key respects, some of its
provisions are tougher, they say. For example, it would mandate that
accounting firms rotate lead auditors for individual clients every
five years.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional critics lashed out at Pitt's plan Thursday. Senate
Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) called it "a toothless tiger
that has no real merit....This is almost a guarantee that you're
going to get another Enron."</TE>
<TE>   However, Robert Herdman, the SEC's chief accountant, said the
diametrically opposing views of the two sides boded well for Pitt's
idea. "We must have the right formula [because accountants] think
they're being shut out and that it's too tough, and everybody [else]
thinks it's too easy," Herdman said.</TE>

<HD>State Farm Limits Home Coverage</HD>
<DH>Insurance: The firm says the move in 21 states is needed to
counter a loss of $5 billion last year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two months after slapping a moratorium on new homeowner business in
California, loss-plagued State Farm Insurance Cos. said Thursday that
it is limiting homeowner policies in 21 other states.</LD>
<LD>   State Farm, the nation's largest insurer of homes, began notifying
regulators in the states this week, saying the cuts are needed to
counter a net loss of $5 billion in 2001, when natural disasters,
large claims for water damage and higher construction and medical
costs caused payouts to increase dramatically.</LD>
<LD>   "Growth in insurance is not always a good thing," said Phil
Supple, a spokesman for the Bloomington, Ill.-based insurer,
explaining that refusing new business shelters the company from
additional liability.</LD>
<TE>   The 15 million U.S. homeowners who already have State Farm
policies are unaffected, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   For years, State Farm had led an industry battle aimed at winning
new customers by keeping premiums low. But that "soft" insurance
market has turned hard of late, with claims rising and investment
earnings down.</TE>
<TE>   One deciding factor was when the company's California home
insurer, State Farm General Insurance Co., was placed on credit watch
by Standard &amp; Poor's and downgraded from A-minus to B-plus by A.M.
Best.</TE>
<TE>   "In our culture that's unacceptable," said State Farm spokesman
Bill Sirola. "We have a tradition of offering our policyholders the
highest levels of financial strength."</TE>
<TE>   Decisions on temporarily refusing or curtailing new business are
being made at the company's 13 regional offices. The company will
"return to the marketplace when the business environment allows us,"
Supple said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the California moratorium on new homeowner
business, State Farm is no longer issuing homeowner policies for new
customers in Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas,
Montana, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Hawaii, Alaska, Maryland, West
Virginia and parts of North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   It also has restricted sales in Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado,
Utah, Nevada, Virginia and Wyoming. There is a cap on the dollar
amount of new insurance that will be written in those states, Supple
said.</TE>
<TE>   Other companies also have cut back on new policies through tougher
underwriting or have placed moratoriums on new policies, said Adam
Klauber, an insurance analyst for Cochran, Coronia &amp; Co. State Farm's
retrenchment could make it harder for consumers to get coverage in
areas where obtaining homeowners' insurance is already difficult, he
said.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Virgin Mobile USA on Sunday will begin rolling out its
long-anticipated wireless telephone service targeted at people under
age 30, with nationwide distribution expected by the end of August.</LD>
<LD>   The joint venture between Richard Branson's Virgin Group and
Sprint Corp. is entering a crowded market that has been seeing
slowing subscriber growth and increasing price competition.</LD>
<LD>   Virgin Mobile's service will be branded as its own service but
will use Sprint PCS' wireless network.</LD>
<TE>   Virgin Mobile USA said it is rolling out a pay-as-you-go plan in
the United States, which often appeals to teenagers and other
customers who lack the credit history to sign long-term contracts.</TE>
<TE>   The service first will be offered in Sacramento and Columbus,
Ohio, on June 23.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Nokia, the world's biggest cell phone maker, said sales for the
second half of this year would grow as much as 10%, instead of
15%--as market conditions continue to be uncertain.</LD>
<LD>   The company also set new long-term sales and earnings growth
targets of more than 10% for 2003 and beyond.</LD>
<LD>   But the Finnish company maintained its previous guidance for pro
forma earnings of 79 cents a share for 2002, excluding goodwill
amortization and nonrecurring items. Chief Executive Jorma Ollila
said he was uncertain when the market would pick up again. Despite
the revised forecast, Nokia shares rose 3 cents to $12.43 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</LD>

<LD>Loudcloud Inc.'s auditor raised concern the Web site manager started
by Netscape founder Marc Andreessen won't be able to stay in business
without getting cash to fund its operations.</LD>
<LD>   Loudcloud this week agreed to sell its Web site management
business to Electronic Data Systems Corp. for $63.5 million to focus
on making software. Without that cash and $9 million it is expected
to gain by purchasing Frontera Corp., Loudcloud may not be able to
sustain operations, Ernst &amp; Young said.</LD>
<LD>   The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based company, which has never made a
profit, spent $42 million this week to repurchase debt, depleting its
cash, Ernst &amp; Young said.</LD>
<TE>   Both the sale to Electronic Data and the Frontera acquisition
require the approval of a majority of Loudcloud's shareholders.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Official Cuts Proposed Royalty for Online Music</HD>
<DH>Radio: Webcasters, musicians and record labels are
displeased with the decision, which requires a per-song fee.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A top federal official Thursday slashed the fees that many online
radio stations must pay for music, a decision angering record labels
and musicians yet still threatening the survival of small Internet
broadcasters.</LD>
<LD>   Librarian of Congress James H. Billington cut by 50% the royalties
that federal arbitrators had proposed for Web-only stations, reducing
their total annual bill by millions of dollars. But Billington
required Web stations to pay a flat fee for each song played, rather
than letting them pay a percentage of their revenue, a decision that
spells doom for scores of fledgling companies trying to provide radio
for niche tastes on the Net for free, critics said.</LD>
<LD>   "This decision drives Beethoven.com and almost all ... small
commercial Webcasters out of business," said Kevin Shively, director
of interactive media at the online classical music outlet. "It
virtually guarantees that Internet radio will consolidate to the
point where there's no distinction between Internet radio and
terrestrial radio"--a medium dominated by a few giant companies that
exerts tight control over what songs get on the air.</LD>
<TE>   Cary Sherman, president of the Recording Industry Assn. of
America, was equally displeased with the ruling, which he said
"simply does not reflect the fair market value of the music."</TE>
<TE>   "The import of this decision is that artists and record labels
will subsidize the Webcasting businesses of multibillion-dollar
companies like Yahoo, AOL, RealNetworks and Viacom," Sherman said in
a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Billington's ruling won't have any immediate effect because the
per-song fees won't have to be paid until late this year. Oct. 20
will be a real day of reckoning for Webcasters, though, because
that's the day they'll have to pay royalties on all music played from
Oct. 28, 1998, to Sept. 1, 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Over-the-air and online radio stations already pay royalties to
songwriters, but they've yet to pay fees to labels and recording
artists. In 1998, Congress ordered online stations to pay royalties
to labels and artists for songs transmitted digitally, with the fees
being set by an arbitration panel. The courts later held that the law
also applied to the Internet transmissions of over-the-air stations.</TE>
<TE>   After a protracted study, the arbitration panel recommended in
February that commercial Internet-only stations pay 0.14 cent per
song per listener and over-the-air stations 0.07 cent per song if
they simulcast their programs on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Billington set aside the panel's proposal last month, and Thursday
he decreed that Internet-only stations and simulcasters alike must
pay .07 cent per song. That translates to about $92 per listener per
year. For a popular outlet such as Radioio, the annual bill would be
about $62,000.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to Sherman's statement, RealNetworks' subscription radio
services aren't covered by the ruling, and Yahoo isn't covered
because it already pays royalties to labels and artists under a deal
previously negotiated with the RIAA. The terms of Yahoo's deal became
the foundation for the arbitrators' proposal and Billington's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   One problem with the whole process is that "the entire industry's
rate is being determined by what one company [Yahoo] did," said Adam
Cohen, an attorney for one group of Webcasters. Internet and
over-the-air broadcasters are expected to press for legislation to
change the way royalties are set and, possibly, roll back the rates
set by Billington.</TE>
<TE>   The RIAA's licensing arm, SoundExchange, says it's willing to
negotiate a compromise that lets small Webcasters pay a percentage of
their revenue. But the labels don't want to extend the same terms to
major media companies, which can afford to pay more for the music
they play online.</TE>
<TE>   The leading trade group for online music and video companies, the
Digital Media Assn., has opposed this approach, calling for all
companies to receive the same terms. Some small Webcasters have been
trying to negotiate a deal with SoundExchange, but they say they
haven't gotten any response to their proposals.</TE>
<TE>   "It's gone slowly.... But we're moving forward," said John Simson,
executive director of SoundExchange. He said he expects negotiations
to pick up within the next two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   By charging a percentage of revenue, small companies' royalty
bills would reflect their ability to sell advertisements and
sponsorships, not how much music they played.</TE>
<TE>   Over-the-air stations, which have tried in vain to be exempted
completely from the new royalties, sought to pay no more than .02
cent per song. "The librarian's decision places a prohibitive
financial burden on radio-station streaming, and will likely result
in the termination of this fledgling service to listeners," said
Eddie Fritts, chief executive of the National Assn. of Broadcasters.</TE>
<TE>   Added Zack Zalon, general manager of RadioFreeVirgin: "Small
Webcasters, the very group that Congress intended to assist ... will
be put out of business." And because of that, he said, consumers who
don't care for mainstream over-the-air fare "will have nowhere to get
their music."</TE>

<HD>Jurors Find Attias Insane</HD>
<DH>Courts: Verdict outrages the victims' families. Defendant,
who ran down and killed four, will probably serve time in a mental
hospital.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM OVEREND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SANTA BARBARA</DL>
<LD>Jurors in the David Attias murder case found Thursday that the
mentally troubled 20-year-old was legally insane last year when he
drove his high-powered Saab into a crowd of Isla Vista pedestrians,
killing four.</LD>
<LD>   The former UC Santa Barbara student and his quietly sobbing
parents watched as Superior Court Judge Thomas Adams ordered local
mental health officials to report back July 12 on Attias' condition,
in preparation for his anticipated commitment to a state mental
institution.</LD>
<LD>   The judgment, after 13 hours of deliberations over two days,
marked a dramatic end to the sanity phase of the two-stage murder
case. It means that Attias, convicted by the same jury last week of
four counts of second-degree murder, will be committed for an
undetermined period.</LD>
<TE>   He could not be freed until a jury ruled, in another court
proceeding, that he had overcome his mental illness. "At this time,
it does not appear that he has recovered fully his sanity," the judge
said.</TE>
<TE>   Attias "was very nervous and scared before the verdict was read,"
said Nancy Haydt, a lawyer on the defense team. "When he heard it, he
told me he was happy."</TE>
<TE>   The decision outraged relatives and friends of the people killed
in the Feb. 23, 2001, car crash on streets filled with young people.
They had hoped that Attias would be sent to state prison for life.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Bourdakis, the father of one of the victims, angrily
denounced the jury's decision. "You can't know how incredibly
disappointed we are in this verdict," he said. "Once again, the state
of California has shown the nation how you can twist the facts and
get away with murder."</TE>
<TE>   Following Bourdakis during a brief news conference outside court,
Daniel Attias, the father of the former UC Santa Barbara freshman,
expressed his gratitude. "We are very grateful," he said. "We also
are very aware of the tragedy that this has brought to many people."</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyer Jack Earley said he believes that Attias will
probably be committed to Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino, and
estimated that it would be at least 10 to 15 years before he would
have a chance of release.</TE>
<TE>   Earley voiced hope that, by then, antipsychotic drugs will have
been developed that can completely control his client's mental
problems, which were first detected in early childhood.</TE>
<TE>   But he dismissed suggestions that Attias might be freed in just a
few years. "David will spend a large part of his life in a mental
hospital," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Grimly brushing past reporters, prosecutors declined comment.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, when jurors convicted Attias, many observers assumed
that the panel would find Attias sane. Such a finding would have
cleared the way for a sentence of up to life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The two days of jury deliberations followed three days of
testimony on Attias' mental state. Two court-appointed psychiatrists
testified that Attias was legally insane, although prosecutors
produced an expert who argued that he was sane.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers said the testimony of their experts obviously
influenced the jury decision.</TE>
<TE>   With Attias' culpability clear from the start, even the first
phase of the trial was dominated by testimony about his mental state.
Witnesses described behavior around campus so odd that he came to be
called "Crazy Dave."</TE>
<TE>   Attias pounded his head against walls as a child, therapists
testified, and tried to strangle his sister when he was 13,
ultimately receiving diagnoses ranging from attention deficit
disorder to budding schizophrenia.</TE>
<TE>   The boy's mental problems split his family, according to testimony
during the first stage of the trial. His father, a successful
television director, said he was often absent from the home. Diana
Attias made it clear in her testimony that the strain from her son's
condition was enormous.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Attias managed to gain admission to the university. His
father pushed him to stay there, although his son was failing and had
asked to transfer to a community college.</TE>
<TE>   According to testimony, David's mental problems escalated at the
university. He substituted marijuana and cocaine for the medication
he was supposed to be taking. He also had two auto accidents, only to
be given a new car by his father. Attorney Earley argued that this
string of emotional problems culminated in a psychotic break the
night of the accident.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Patrick McKinley conceded that Attias, heavily
medicated since his arrest immediately after the crash, is mentally
ill but said he knew what he was doing when he hit five pedestrians.
Witnesses testified that he leaped from his car and fought onlookers,
shouting, "I am the angel of death."</TE>
<TE>   The jury deliberated almost six days before rejecting manslaughter
in favor of the second-degree murder convictions. The panel found
that Attias had acted with malice, which signaled to some that jurors
would ultimately find him to have been sane at the time of the crime.</TE>
<TE>   But Earley had said he still hoped the jury would recognize that
Attias could not possibly meet the legal standard for sanity: knowing
right from wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "A state mental hospital is not a pretty picture, but at least
they are dealing with treatment there," Earley said Thursday. "David
would not have made it in prison. He would have been too frightened."</TE>
<TE>   "This was a hard case for both sides," he said. "It was hard for
all the parents. One main message for parents with mentally ill
children is that if they learn about their children's problems, they
should do everything in their power to help them, and they can. I
think what happened at school is he just fell apart."</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning, the case focused attention on the
alcohol-dominated party scene that prevails in the Isla Vista
neighborhood on weekends. Some safety steps have since been taken,
including lights on streets where partyers roam late into the night.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives of the victims attended the trial often. Those killed
were Ellie Israel, 27, and Christopher Divis, Ruth Levy and Nicholas
Bourdakis, all 20. A fifth victim, Albert Levy, suffered serious
injuries, but recovered.</TE>

<HD>Parents Sue Over Boy's Drowning</HD>
<DH>Courts: Child's body was found in murky water of pool two
days after party.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY McCARTNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The parents of a young boy who drowned in a mansion pool earlier this
month sued the homeowner Wednesday, alleging that poor maintenance
and negligence caused their son's death.</LD>
<LD>   Paolo Ayala drowned June 2 while attending a classmate's pool
party on Los Angeles' Westside. An intensive two-day search by police
and neighbors failed to find the 7-year-old, whose body was in the
deep end of the pool, where police believe murky water hid the body.</LD>
<LD>   Franklin and Eduina Ayala are seeking punitive and special
damages, including compensation for emotional distress and loss of
future income, as well as reimbursement of funeral and burial fees.</LD>
<TE>   The suit alleges that Saeed and Kimberly Farkhondehpour were
negligent about the upkeep of the pool, resulting in increased
emotional distress for the boy's family while the body was missing.
The suit also charges that the owners failed to properly supervise
Paolo, who did not know how to swim.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Jack Zakariaie, who represents the Farkhondehpour family,
said the filing of the suit was unfortunate but not unexpected. He
said the Ayalas initially told his clients they were not responsible
for the boy's death.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Feldman, who represents the Ayalas, said the Farkhondehpours
were responsible for monitoring Paolo.</TE>
<TE>   Zakariaie disagreed. "This kid had no place being at a pool party
when he didn't know how to swim," the attorney said. He added: "I'm
not sure if the water wasn't murky, it would have made a difference
in this case." Zakariaie said there was adequate supervision at the
party--one adult per child--and that the pool was serviced by a pool
man every Monday.</TE>

<HD>Stronger Clergy Sex-Abuse Board Getting Started in L.A.
Archdiocese</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A newly strengthened clergy misconduct review board vowed Thursday to
rid the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles of any priest who
sexually preys on children.</LD>
<LD>   Board members, some of whom were formally introduced Thursday by
Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, include a sexual-abuse survivor, parents of
young children, mental-health professionals, attorneys, a priest and
a nun.</LD>
<LD>   The new board, which will address only sexual misconduct, replaces
a more informal advisory group whose names were kept secret. It
wields broader authority to review every such allegation against
clergy in the three-county archdiocese and make direct
recommendations to Mahony, archbishop of Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   "The main thing we're interested in is ensuring that the priests
... are not predators, that they're not going to take advantage of
our children or anyone," said board Chairman Richard P. Byrne, a
former Los Angeles Superior Court presiding judge. "If there is a
bias at all, it is in removing a person from ministry."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said the new panel, called the Clergy Misconduct Oversight
Board, represents "another chapter in efforts of the archdiocese ...
to make certain all [churches] are safe for children and young
people."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about further measures that would strengthen the board's
independence, such as making board recommendations binding, or
allowing an outside lay council to make some appointments, Mahony
said there were roadblocks. He said he could not surrender such
authority because only bishops are empowered under canon law to make
personnel decisions about priests. He said, however, that he had
widely consulted the community about potential board members and had
closely followed the past board's advice.</TE>
<TE>   More than 50 priests in the archdiocese are under investigation by
law enforcement for allegations of sexually abusing minors.</TE>
<TE>   The new board will have 13 members, not all of whom have yet been
appointed by Mahony. Among other things, it will annually review
archdiocesan sexual abuse policies, review all sexual misconduct
complaints and verify that the archdiocese has reported them to civil
authorities. It will also make recommendations on such things as
pastoral outreach and whether to notify parishes of abuse allegations
or remove offenders from ministry.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the previous board, the new oversight panel will monitor
how closely Mahony follows its recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   Other board members include:</TE>
<TE>   * William and Judi Arnold, parents of boys molested by a priest.</TE>
<TE>   * Nanette DeFuentes, a psychologist. DeFuentes said she was abused
by a minister in a nondenominational Christian church from age 18 to
22, an experience she said has helped drive her passion to help
survivors and help treat perpetrators.</TE>
<TE>   * Sister Diane Donoghue, director of Esperanza Community Housing
Corp., which builds affordable housing for low-income families.
Donoghue, a member of Sisters of Social Service and a community
organizer, said she brings experience working with immigrant
communities and Catholic values of social and economic justice.</TE>
<TE>   * James McGough, a professor of clinical psychiatry at UCLA,
specializing in treatment of adults and children. McGough said he
also brings the perspective of a father with two young children.</TE>
<TE>   * Kevin Jablonski, a Los Angeles clinical psychologist.</TE>
<TE>   * The Rev. Jarlath Cunnane, pastor of St. Thomas the Apostle
Church in Los Angeles. Cunnane works on immigrant rights, labor
issues and improving community-police relations. A strong advocate of
"zero tolerance" for sexually abusive priests, Cunnane said he hopes
the new board will "bring some openness and transparency to the
process and to the judgments that are made here."</TE>

<HD>MTA's Bus Stops to Get Display Makeover</HD>
<DH>Transit: Information cubes and decals will be added along
some routes as part of a plan to improve the posting of maps and
schedules.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has stepped up the posting
of route maps and schedules at its bus stops and is exploring ways to
equip all of its 18,000 bus stops around Los Angeles County with
better information displays, officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   During the next few months the MTA is expected to install hundreds
of information cubes at bus stops--at $120 each--along the heavily
traveled bus lines on Western Avenue and Ventura, Van Nuys, and
Wilshire boulevards.</LD>
<LD>   The MTA is also experimenting with affixing low-cost decals on bus
stop poles that would display simplified route maps and information
on how frequently buses pass. The bright yellow, self-adhesive decals
will be tested in the next couple of months.</LD>
<TE>   The authority initiated the measures after The Times reported in
January that only 2.7% of the MTA's bus stops displayed route maps or
schedule information, while 22% of the bus stops in San Francisco and
more than 85% of stops in New York City had such displays.</TE>
<TE>   About 25% of the stops for the DASH bus system operated by the Los
Angeles Department of Transportation posted such information.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA's new push to improve information displays at its bus
stops is good for riders, said Bart Reed, executive director of The
Transit Coalition, a nonprofit advocacy organization based in Sylmar.
"Considering the lack of information now, whatever they're going to
do is helpful."</TE>
<TE>   According to studies and experts, posting route maps or schedules
promotes ridership. But many transit managers have expressed concerns
over the potentially high cost of installing and maintaining such
displays.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles it would cost about $1.8 million to equip the
remaining MTA bus stops with cubes--oblong metal and plastic boxes
with information on four sides--or single-sided signs, plus an
additional $700,000 every year to maintain them, according to a staff
report presented Thursday to the agency's planning and programming
committee.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina, an MTA board member,
had asked for the report in response to The Times article.</TE>
<TE>   At the committee hearing Thursday, Molina examined a prototype
information decal and praised MTA staff members for developing an
innovative and low-cost solution</TE>
<TE>   The 1 3/4-inch by 8-inch decals would be dwarfed by the 6 1/2-inch
by 23-inch cubes, but it would cost only $200,000 to equip all the
stops with them.</TE>
<TE>   Easy to install, the decals can be added at the rate of hundreds
per week and require only $93,000 a year to maintain, according to
the report.</TE>
<TE>   In January, MTA officials said they intended to have 900 bus stops
equipped with information cubes in the next few years. By the end of
August, the MTA said, 850 of the agency's bus stops will be equipped
with cubes. If the decal plan is successful, the agency would like to
post them at all stops, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   The agency is also considering using a mix of decals, one-sided
signs and cubes.</TE>

<HD>Troubled Charter School Gets Conditional Extension</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUFIYA ABDUR-RAHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Antelope Valley Union High School District Board of Trustees
voted unanimously to approve a five-year conditional renewal of the
charter for Desert Sands Charter School, officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Supt. Robert Girolamo initially recommended that the board refuse
to renew the year-old school's charter amid concerns that Desert
Sands misused state education funds on lawsuits, hired inexperienced
employees and received state funding it didn't deserve by overstating
its enrollment.</LD>
<LD>   At a Tuesday meeting between Girolamo and Desert Sands
administrators, the required conditions for a charter renewal were
laid out, said Desert Sands Chairman Jeff Brown.</LD>
<TE>   Those conditions, which, according to district documents, were
adopted by the board on Wednesday, included an agreement to decide by
July 3 how annual audits would be handled. And by June 30, several
decisions must be made, including how the school would obtain
instructional materials and how employee background checks would be
conducted.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Finley, an attorney for the nontraditional school that has
campuses in Lancaster and Palmdale, said he was pleased the charter
was approved and is confident the school can meet the conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "Our office and clients put a lot of time, resources and efforts
into making sure that the school is providing the best service to its
students," Finley said.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Keeler, a school district attorney, said Desert Sands
representatives "gave us a lot of information about many reforms that
they had put in place or were putting in place that resolved many of
the district's concerns about the operation of the charter school."</TE>

<LD>When it came time to put on the cap and gown Thursday, nobody was
left out at the Los Angeles school system's mini-district graduations
in the southwest San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Despite a controversial policy prohibiting students without
post-secondary plans from participating in commencement, all of the
eligible seniors in Los Angeles Unified School District's Subdistrict
C walked on stage to accept their diplomas Thursday. By the end of
next week's ceremonies, 3,596 students will have graduated this year
from the subdistrict's eight high schools.</LD>
<LD>   Some seniors continued to complain about the policy, while
administrators continued to defend it. "I think it's a good idea, but
I don't think it should be forced," said Sergio Mercado, a senior.</LD>
<TE>   But subdistrict officials said the policy gave seniors an
opportunity to ponder their future at a time when the value of a high
school diploma in the job market is diminishing.</TE>
<TE>   Some students said they would never have applied to college had it
not been for the policy. Others said that even though they've been
accepted, they won't follow through by enrolling.</TE>
<TE>   When the final commencement ceremony is held next Thursday at Van
Nuys High School, it will mark the completion of a school year in
which the subdistrict saw a 6% rise in the graduation rate from the
previous year and an increased number of students admitted into
community colleges and the University of California system, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to recognize each of you for having a post-secondary
plan," said Subdistrict C Supt. Robert Collins to 400 graduating
seniors at a morning rehearsal Thursday at Reseda High School. "I
know some of you said you didn't want us to make you do that. But for
some of you, you're going to college now ... you're going to be some
of the most famous graduates in the country."</TE>
<TE>   Collins instituted the graduation policy in 1987 when he was
principal of Grant High School in Van Nuys. This was the first year
the policy applied to all of the subdistrict's high schools, which
include Grant, Reseda, Van Nuys, Birmingham, Cleveland, Taft, the
Sherman Oaks Center for Enriched Studies and Valley Alternative.</TE>
<TE>   To qualify for the ceremony, students had to show that they had
committed or would commit in the near future either to a four-year
college or university, a two-year college, a trade or vocational
program, an internship or apprenticeship, or military service.</TE>
<TE>   Civil libertarians criticized the policy, calling it elitist.
Controversy over the policy also attracted attention from the
national media.</TE>
<TE>   "If the school district were really intent on giving every kid an
opportunity, then they should put more college counselors in school,
give more access to college curriculum, and provide more teachers and
facilities to realize that possibility," said Mark Rosenbaum, legal
director for the Southern California chapter of the American Civil
Liberties Union. "It's a very superficial program that may make
districts look good, but it doesn't really translate into equal
educational opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   School board President Caprice Young supports the policy, but
would like the district to instill a desire for post-secondary
education in students at a younger age. She said the policy may have
hit a nerve with adults because "there's a real empathy with the
kids, a real feeling that they shouldn't be penalized if they're 17
and haven't figured out what to do. Some of us in our 30s still
haven't figured it out."</TE>
<TE>   Officials credit the policy with increasing the number of
graduates in the class of 2002 by 295 students. The policy may also
be the reason for the significant increase in acceptances at
community colleges in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Cornner, a spokesman for Pierce College, warned that until
students enroll, it will be hard to gauge whether the policy truly
succeeded.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of students were scrambling around to meet the
requirements, and many of them may have chosen to apply at community
college because we're the easiest and cheapest way," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For 18-year-old Reseda High graduate Sergio Rivera Jr., there was
a sense of relief and excitement after getting accepted to the
College of the Canyons.</TE>
<TE>   "The policy is a good thing," he said. "They're preparing you for
life."</TE>

<HD>With New Commencement Policy in Place, Every Grad Has a
Future</HD>
<DH>Education: So far, no students in Valley's Subdistrict C
have been banned from ceremony for not making plans beyond high
school.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When it came time to put on the cap and gown Thursday, nobody was
left out at the Los Angeles school system's mini-district graduations
in the southwest San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Despite a controversial policy prohibiting students without
post-secondary plans from participating in commencement, all of the
eligible seniors in Los Angeles Unified School District's Subdistrict
C walked on stage to accept their diplomas Thursday. By the end of
next week's ceremonies, 3,596 students will have graduated this year
from the subdistrict's eight high schools.</LD>
<LD>   Some seniors continued to complain about the policy, while
administrators continued to defend it. "I think it's a good idea, but
I don't think it should be forced," said Sergio Mercado, a senior.</LD>
<TE>   But subdistrict officials said the policy gave seniors an
opportunity to ponder their future at a time when the value of a high
school diploma in the job market is diminishing.</TE>
<TE>   Some students said they would never have applied to college had it
not been for the policy. Others said that even though they've been
accepted, they won't follow through by enrolling.</TE>
<TE>   When the final commencement ceremony is held next Thursday at Van
Nuys High School, it will mark the completion of a school year in
which the subdistrict saw a 6% rise in the graduation rate from the
previous year and an increased number of students admitted into
community colleges and the University of California system, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to recognize each of you for having a post-secondary
plan," said Subdistrict C Supt. Robert Collins to 400 graduating
seniors at a morning rehearsal Thursday at Reseda High School. "I
know some of you said you didn't want us to make you do that. But for
some of you, you're going to college now ... you're going to be some
of the most famous graduates in the country."</TE>
<TE>   Collins instituted the graduation policy in 1987 when he was
principal of Grant High School in Van Nuys. This was the first year
the policy applied to all of the subdistrict's high schools, which
include Grant, Reseda, Van Nuys, Birmingham, Cleveland, Taft, the
Sherman Oaks Center for Enriched Studies and Valley Alternative.</TE>
<TE>   To qualify for the ceremony, students had to show that they had
committed or would commit in the near future either to a four-year
college or university, a two-year college, a trade or vocational
program, an internship or apprenticeship, or military service.</TE>
<TE>   Civil libertarians criticized the policy, calling it elitist.
Controversy over the policy also attracted attention from the
national media.</TE>
<TE>   "If the school district were really intent on giving every kid an
opportunity, then they should put more college counselors in school,
give more access to college curriculum, and provide more teachers and
facilities to realize that possibility," said Mark Rosenbaum, legal
director for the Southern California chapter of the American Civil
Liberties Union. "It's a very superficial program that may make
districts look good, but it doesn't really translate into equal
educational opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   School board President Caprice Young supports the policy, but
would like the district to instill a desire for post-secondary
education in students at a younger age. She said the policy may have
hit a nerve with adults because "there's a real empathy with the
kids, a real feeling that they shouldn't be penalized if they're 17
and haven't figured out what to do. Some of us in our 30s still
haven't figured it out."</TE>
<TE>   Officials credit the policy with increasing the number of
graduates in the class of 2002 by 295 students. The policy may also
be the reason for the significant increase in acceptances at
community colleges in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said 429 students were admitted into Santa Monica
College this year compared with 198 last year, 634 to Los Angeles
Valley College compared with 339 last year, and 1,197 to Pierce
College compared with 1,006 last year.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Cornner, a spokesman for Pierce, warned that until students
enroll, it will be hard to gauge whether the policy truly succeeded.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of students were scrambling around to meet the requirements
and many of them may have chosen to apply at community college
because we're the easiest and cheapest way," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For 18-year-old Reseda High graduate Sergio Rivera Jr., there was
a sense of relief and excitement after getting accepted to the
College of the Canyons and completing his high school years.</TE>
<TE>   "The policy is a good thing," he said. "They're preparing you for

<HD>Accused Judge Wins OK to Quit Election</HD>
<DH>Law: O.C.'s Ronald Kline, facing a child sex trial, will
pull his name from a reelection ballot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ending one of Orange County's strangest election dramas, a Superior
Court judge who had sought a second term while facing child
pornography and molestation charges won permission Thursday to drop
out of the coming election.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Ronald C. Kline had asked to remove his name from the ballot
after failing to win a majority of votes in the March primary
election, forcing him into a November runoff with one of the many
write-in candidates who campaigned against him.</LD>
<LD>   His withdrawal was opposed by county election officials and his
top-vote-getting write-in opponent, who argued that it was too late.</LD>
<TE>   But Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge David P. Yaffe on
Thursday ruled that Kline's request was timely and ordered Orange
County to remove Kline from the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "The judge made the right call.... The election controversy is now
over," Kline's attorney, Paul S. Meyer, said in a written statement
after the ruling. "We will focus our full attention on the legal
defense of charges."</TE>
<TE>   Kline, who remains under house arrest pending the outcome of his
criminal cases, had argued that remaining on the ballot could
undermine his chances of receiving a fair trail.</TE>
<TE>   The 61-year-old jurist faces federal charges of possessing
pornographic images of children on his home and courthouse computers
and state charges of molesting a 14-year-old boy a quarter-century
ago. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.</TE>
<TE>   Kline's attempt to remove his name from the ballot was given
little chance by most legal experts. Election law makes it difficult
for candidates to drop out, and judges have rarely ruled on the
issue.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the county registrar of voters argued that Kline could
not withdraw once votes were cast in the March 5 primary. But Yaffe
ruled that Kline became a qualified candidate in the upcoming run-off
only when the Board of Supervisors certified the primary's results on
March 25. By that stage, Kline had already asked to withdraw.</TE>
<TE>   County attorneys, as well as Dana Point attorney John Adams, the
write-in candidate who opposed Kline's attempt to withdraw, all said
they have no plans to appeal the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy that it's over," said Adams, who was the top
vote-getter in the primary election. "It's been a distraction. Now we
can move on to the fall election."</TE>
<TE>   While Thursday's ruling ended Kline's candidacy, it remains
undecided whose name might appear with Adams' on the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The county plans to list only Adams' name. But attorney Gay
Sandoval, the runner-up among write-in candidates in the primary,
said she hopes county officials will add her name now that Kline's
has been removed. If they refuse, she said, she will probably ask the
courts to intervene.</TE>

<KH>POINTS WEST</KH>
<HD>Billboard a Landmark in Cultural Wasteland</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Careful readers of the newspaper might have noticed two stories this
week that were unrelated but undoubtedly linked.</LD>
<LD>   One was about the demise of hell. It explained how Sunday
preachers are watering down their warnings of pitchforks and lakes of
fire, partly to avoid scaring parishioners away from the collection
plate.</LD>
<LD>   The other story concerns a West L.A. billboard promoting a new CD
from Death Row Records. It depicts a cartoon character on a toilet
with his pants down, and under the commode is a tough-guy boast
containing a four-letter word for poo.</LD>
<TE>   Obviously, hell was there for a reason.</TE>
<TE>   The billboard is at Wilshire Boulevard and San Vicente, which puts
it in L.A. City Councilman Jack Weiss' district. When I griped about
it this week, Weiss said he shared my view, but wondered how we got
so old so fast. Weren't we among those who defended controversial pop
figures like Lenny Bruce and Jim Morrison, and giggled over a puritan
obsession with obscenity?</TE>
<TE>   Yes, I said. But this is about pop culture in a death spiral,
dragging all of us down with it.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss agreed again, but worried that if we make too much of the
billboard, we might play into the hands of its creators.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe so. But what's the cost of doing nothing?</TE>
<TE>   "You sound like Dan Quayle giving his Murphy Brown speech," Weiss
said, referring to the former vice president's attack on an unmarried
TV mom. Are standards really lower than ever? Weiss wondered. "And
who are the arbiters" of obscenity and taste?</TE>
<TE>   Until further notice, I am.</TE>
<TE>   I'm the guy, after all, who wrote about the promotion for the
Bernie Mac TV show, which FOX aired during the World Series. In that
promo, you may recall, Mac was seated on the can.</TE>
<TE>   There's actually something honest about this trend. Given what the
pop culture factory cranks out, particularly in Hollywood, there's a
goodly amount that makes me want to reach for a plunger.</TE>
<TE>   Let's get a group shot the next time Hollywood lays an egg.
Actors, writers, directors, producers, studio chiefs. Instead of the
usual over-the-top billboard ad, let's put them all up there on a
giant commode.</TE>
<TE>   And then why not do the same with the 8 million billboards for TV
news teams, whose hairdos alone violate several of my own obscenity
standards? And why do we need 12 million billboards for strip joints
with names like Spearmint Rhino?</TE>
<TE>   What in the world is with that name, anyway? Do they trot out
naked pachyderms?</TE>
<TE>   I'm convinced there are no standards in Southern California for
visual clutter. Certainly not at Wilshire and San Vicente, where the
first person I ran into on Tuesday was Patsy Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   She looked at the billboard and said:</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe it's still up there. I work in an ad agency, and
we all said the same thing. We didn't think you could use the word
[poo] on a billboard."</TE>
<TE>   Garcia took me up to the 10th-floor offices of D'Arcy, Masius,
Benton &amp; Bowles, where many of the windows offer a bird's-eye view of
the pinhead on the toilet.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the lowest common denominator principle," said Kevin
Yarbrough, an ad manager who finds himself ever more vigilant as he
tries to protect his two kids from the steady advance of the crass
and profane.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Anderholt, an account manager who takes his three daughters
to the Agoura Bible Fellowship, has the worst deal of all. The
billboard practically fills his office window, making it seem as if
he's in the bathroom with this joker.</TE>
<TE>   He gets to work in the morning, and that guy's on the can.</TE>
<TE>   He comes back from lunch, and the guy's still on the can.</TE>
<TE>   It's the longest bathroom visit since Elvis died on the throne.</TE>
<TE>   And looking beyond the billboard offers no relief to the
churchgoing Anderholt.</TE>
<TE>   Rising over the top of it is the House of Hustler, with "Flynt
Publications" emblazoned across the building in Satan's own script.</TE>
<TE>   "I ignore it as much as possible," Anderholt said. "And the good
thing is that I'm facing west, so when the sun starts to set I close
the blinds and can't see any of it."</TE>
<TE>   He looked out the window again.</TE>
<TE>   "The TV culture is now on billboards," Anderholt lamented, saying
his 15-year-old daughter is rebelling against her parents with all
her might, and wants to see R-rated films, as her friends do.</TE>
<TE>   Good luck, Dad.</TE>
<TE>   I put in a call to Death Row Records, by the way, which had no
comment. Instead, they referred me to a publicist who had no comment.
It seems to me someone in the operation is expendable.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, neighbors circulated a petition calling for the
billboard to come down. Councilman Weiss was investigating whether
the thing violates decency standards, and whether Death Row even had
permission to put it up.</TE>
<TE>   Readers of my World Series column wrote to tell me Bernie Mac
really was a pretty good show, for which I'd like to congratulate
everyone involved. Others wrote to tell me what a schoolmarm I was,
while still others called me a dope for having been shocked to
discover that pop culture is circling the drain.</TE>
<TE>   Allow me to clarify. I wasn't shocked by the TV promo, and I'm not
shocked by the billboard. If this stuff were shocking, it might
actually have some social value.</TE>
<TE>   The crime is that it's obvious, unoriginal, crass, crude and
vapid, and it can have no impact other than to diminish civility and
lower the national IQ.</TE>
<TE>   Eternal damnation got a bad rap if you ask me. Is it too late to
bring back hell?</TE>

<HD>State, County Settle Medicaid Billing Suit of
Whistle-Blower</HD>
<DH>Health: The agreement gives $1.36 million to the employee
who alleged improper invoicing in minors' program. U.S. to be paid
$73.3 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state and Los Angeles County have agreed to pay $73.3 million to
the federal government to settle allegations they improperly billed
the Medicaid program for health services to some minors.</LD>
<LD>   The claims were raised in a whistle-blower lawsuit filed by
Gurubanda Singh Khalsa, director of financial services for the county
Department of Mental Health. Khalsa, who still holds the position,
will receive $1.36 million of the award.</LD>
<LD>   In a suit filed in 1999, Khalsa alleged that he warned the county
in 1998 that it had overbilled the federal Medicaid program by $7.5
million for health services to minors ineligible for assistance.</LD>
<TE>   Rather than paying the money back, he alleged, his superiors and
state officials "made false statements and records in order to
conceal their obligation to return these sums to the federal
government." His lawsuit was filed under the federal False Claims
Act.</TE>
<TE>   As part of a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department, which
took over the case, Los Angeles County will pay $6.8 million
immediately, as well as $140,646 to Khalsa's lawyers. The state will
pay the U.S. government $66.5 million, plus $18.7 million in
interest, over nine years beginning in July 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The state and county deny wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   The problems arose because of a "minor consent program" operated
by the state as part of Medi-Cal, the state's version of Medicaid,
which provides health coverage for poor and disabled people. The
program let minors, without parental consent, receive medical
services related to sexual assault, drug or alcohol abuse, pregnancy,
family planning, sexually transmitted diseases and mental health
care.</TE>
<TE>   When minors seek services through the program, state law bars
authorities from contacting the parents about the application. As a
result, the state cannot confirm family income. Without such proof,
the minor's care is not eligible for federal reimbursement.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is saying this is a bad program. This is a great program,"
said Brandon Wisoff, Khalsa's lawyer. "But when the state of
California enacted that program, they did it with their eyes wide
open and they knew clearly that they couldn't claim federal funds for
those services."</TE>
<TE>   Principal Deputy County Counsel Anita Lee said the county was
simply following the state's lead in claiming the Medicaid payments.
"The overpayment was not the result of fraud," she said. "This is
part of a larger misunderstanding between the state and federal
government."</TE>
<TE>   In July 1998, the state told counties that such services were not
reimbursable under federal rules, and Los Angeles County stopped
billing for them and set aside a pot of money to repay the federal
government for the mistakes, said David Meyer, chief deputy director
of the county Department of Mental Health.</TE>
<TE>   Regarding Khalsa's allegations that the county dismissed his
warnings and colluded with the state to cover up the billings, Meyer
said: "I have no knowledge of that."</TE>
<TE>   State officials attributed the improper billings to "honest
mistakes" made between 1988 and 1999. "The settlement resolves those
mistakes, which were made in previous administrations," said Barbara
Yonemura, deputy director and chief counsel of the state Department
of Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   Yonemura said it's too early to say whether the settlement
payments--nearly $7.4 million annually, plus interest--will result in
future budget cuts for health services. The payments are a fraction
of the $26 billion the state spends on Medi-Cal annually.</TE>
<TE>   Facing a budget deficit of $23.6 billion this year, Gov. Gray
Davis has proposed cutting $758.3 million in general-fund payments
for Medi-Cal.</TE>

<HD>Medicaid Billing Suit Is Settled</HD>
<DH>Health: The state, L.A. County agree to pay whistle-blower
and give $73.3 million to U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state and Los Angeles County have agreed to pay $73.3 million to
the federal government to settle allegations they improperly billed
the Medicaid program for health services to some minors.</LD>
<LD>   The claims were raised in a whistle-blower lawsuit filed by
Gurubanda Singh Khalsa, director of financial services for the county
Department of Mental Health. Khalsa, who still holds the position,
will receive $1.36 million.</LD>
<LD>   In a suit filed in 1999, Khalsa alleged that he warned the county
in 1998 that it had overbilled the federal Medicaid program by $7.5
million for health services to minors ineligible for assistance.</LD>
<TE>   Rather than paying the money back, he alleged, his superiors and
state officials "made false statements and records in order to
conceal their obligation to return these sums to the federal
government." His lawsuit was filed under the federal False Claims
Act.</TE>
<TE>   As part of a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department, which
took over the case, Los Angeles County will pay $6.8 million
immediately, as well as $140,646 to Khalsa's lawyers. The state will
pay the U.S. government $66.5 million, plus $18.7 million interest,
over nine years, starting July 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The state and county deny wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   The problems arose because of a "minor consent program" operated
by the state as part of Medi-Cal, the state's version of Medicaid,
which provides health coverage for poor and disabled people. The
program let minors, without parental consent, receive medical
services, including those related to sex, drug, alcohol and
mental-health concerns.</TE>
<TE>   When minors seek services through the program, state law bars
authorities from contacting the parents about the application. As a
result, the state cannot confirm family income. Without such proof,
the minor's care is not eligible for federal reimbursement.</TE>

<HD>State Takes Over Cleanup</HD>
<DH>Oxnard: Regulators assume control after officials warn that
the toxic gasoline additive MTBE could eventually reach water wells
that service 200,000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIN GRENNAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State regulators Thursday assumed control of a groundwater
contamination cleanup in Oxnard after local water officials warned of
possible "catastrophic" results if immediate action was not taken to
remove pollutants that may cause cancer.</LD>
<LD>   If an underground plume of MTBE, a toxic gasoline additive,
changed direction it could eventually reach water wells that supply
200,000 customers in Oxnard and Port Hueneme, water officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "Our main intention is ... to protect the drinking water supply,"
said Dennis Dickerson of the California Regional Water Quality
Control Board.</LD>
<TE>   Cleaning up the MTBE, which leaked before 1998 from a Poole Oil
Co. underground fuel storage tank on Vineyard Avenue, was already on
a fast-track list with work set to begin in September. But United
Water Conservation District officials sent a letter last week to the
state water board urging quicker action.</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura County Board of Supervisors also wrote the regulatory
agency this week supporting the district's position. Until now, the
county's Environmental Health Division had been in charge of the
cleanup.</TE>
<TE>   The edge of the 200-foot by 125-foot plume of MTBE, a possible
carcinogen added to gasoline to reduce air pollution, was last
located in May about 1,400 feet from the district's wells and was
headed away from the water supply, said Steve Bachman, groundwater
manager for the United Water Conservation District.</TE>
<TE>   Tests in recent weeks show the slope of the groundwater is
changing as a result of drought-like conditions, and Bachman fears
this could redirect the MTBE toward the wells.</TE>
<TE>   The worst-case scenario, Bachman said, is that the toxic chemical
could reach the wells in about a year, forcing the district to shut
down the field.</TE>
<TE>   "That well field supplies about half of the water supply to
200,000 people. It's the most important well field in the county of
Ventura," Bachman said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had to turn those wells off, the cities and the naval base
would need to find an alternate source of water," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the MTBE never reaches the wells, Bachman is concerned
that changes his water district has implemented to help avert
disaster are damaging aquifers.</TE>
<TE>   The district is diverting river water to an area beneath El Rio to
repel MTBE so customers who normally receive that water have to use
pumps, which in turn damage aquifers.</TE>
<TE>   Bachman said the state-directed cleanup should start no later than
mid-August and that plans should be revised so that the fastest,
rather than the most cost-efficient, method is used.</TE>
<TE>   The district also wants additional monitoring sites installed
between the leak and the well field to ensure there are not any
unknown concentrations of MTBE.</TE>
<TE>   Dickerson, executive officer of the water quality board's Los
Angeles region, said the state agency will now demand more frequent
monitoring of the site.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the board, the water district, Poole and the Board
of Supervisors will meet next week to review the latest cleanup plan
and consider whether changes, including moving up the start date,
should be made, Dickerson said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's responding in a responsible way to the issue and
that's what I wanted," said Supervisor John Flynn, whose district
includes Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   "Bring people together and look at the scientific evidence, that's
what they've got to do."</TE>

<LD>An MTA committee recommended Thursday that the transit agency suspend
developing the land it owns around the North Hollywood subway station
until it figures out what it wants.</LD>
<LD>   In November, the planning and programming committee had
recommended that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board
enter into exclusive talks with a team of developers to build a
$90-million urban village next to the Metro Red Line station that
would have combined residential and retail space.</LD>
<LD>   But when board members disagreed over the proposal, the staff
realized the agency's vision for the site "wasn't clearly
articulated," said James L. de la Loza, the MTA's executive officer
for countywide planning and development.</LD>
<TE>   Deferring development, De la Loza added, would allow the MTA more
time to meet with community members and achieve a broader consensus
on the development's goals.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, the planning committee recommended that the MTA
enter into exclusive negotiations with developers for building
commercial space and high-density living units at the Wilshire /
Vermont Red Line station as well as at the Hollywood and Vine Red
Line stop.</TE>

<HD>Group Wants Irvine Project Put to a Vote</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An environmental group is circulating petitions to force a citywide
vote on a massive development in north Irvine.</LD>
<LD>   City Council members this month voted to annex the Northern
Sphere, 7,700 acres where the Irvine Co. plans to build 12,350 homes
and 7 million square feet of commercial and office space. More than
half the land would remain as open space.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, representatives of Newport Beach-based Defend the
Bay began gathering the approximately 8,000 signatures needed to
place on a ballot a referendum asking voters to overturn the
annexation.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a regional concern, and [the pollution from the development]
will flow downstream to Newport Bay," said Bob Caustin, the group's
director. "When you have an extra quarter-million car trips each day,
it affects everyone. There's more fumes, more cars idling on the
roads, more oil droppings, more of everything."</TE>
<TE>   Caustin also objects to a council-approved zoning change that
would allow the Irvine Co. to plow under 3,100 acres of farmland to
make way for its development.</TE>
<TE>   "People moved there with the promise that land would be open space
and agricultural land," he said. "Now to learn it's being taken away,
people are mad."</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Mayor Larry Agran called the effort the work of outsiders
who could open the door for proponents of a commercial airport at the
former El Toro Marine base and scuttle the city's plan to build a
"Great Park" there instead. "This is all about whether we here in
Irvine will be able to control our own destiny," Agran said.</TE>
<TE>   In a prepared statement, Agran and Councilman Mike Ward questioned
whether there was a link between Defend the Bay and backers of an
airport at El Toro, which Irvine strongly opposes. "Before any
residents sign a petition, we believe they should demand to know more
about who is behind this drive, who is financing it and their real
motives," they said.</TE>

<HD>Police and Fire Games: They Play Hard, Too</HD>
<DH>Sports: Santa Ana officers host nearly 10,000 athletes in
the state's 36th annual competition. Proceeds benefit charities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Police Lt. Diane Urban discussed her strategy in the upcoming
arm-wrestling competition at the California Police and Fire Games,
she just as easily could have been describing how she captures
fugitives on the streets of San Jose.</LD>
<LD>   "You have to be very composed," said Urban, defending women's
champion in the 35-to-39 age group. "You need to go in fast and hard
and you must have a great technique. It's only the two of us up there
and it can be pretty nerve-racking."</LD>
<LD>   Urban is one of nearly 10,000 competitors in the 36th annual
Police and Fire Games, hosted this year by the Santa Ana Police
Department. The games began with 504 athletes competing in 16 events,
but there are now 60 events, including pool, darts, skeet shooting,
over-the-line (beach softball) and paintball. Firefighters used to
hold their own competitions, but two years ago the events were
combined.</LD>
<TE>   The games began Sunday at venues all over Orange and Riverside
counties and conclude Saturday afternoon. The week of competition
will bring in an estimated $9 million dollars to the local economy,
according to event officials.</TE>
<TE>   All net proceeds will go to charitable organizations such as the
Santa Ana Police Officers Assn.--Widows and Orphans Fund, the Boys
and Girls Club of Santa Ana, and the United Cerebral Palsy
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the competitors use the games as motivation to stay fit
throughout the year. But others, like Urban, are former high school
and college athletes who simply thrive on the competition.</TE>
<TE>   A former three-time NCAA Division II discus champion at Cal State
Hayward, Urban is one of the more decorated athletes in the event's
history with more than 50 gold medals. She has dominated
arm-wrestling--which is officially known as "wrist-wrestling"--and
field events in track and field over the last 15 years, despite being
slowed by a surgically repaired knee.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Rhodes, a wrist-wrestling official, said competitors should
not be fooled by Urban's soft features. "The paint and the polish go
away once she steps up to the table," Rhodes said. "It's all guts and
it's all business."</TE>
<TE>   Thanks in part to events like this, the days of the overweight cop
on the street are slowly fading away, Urban says. "In the old days,
you'd see cops everywhere hanging out at the doughnut shops," Urban
said. "Now you see them at places like Jamba Juice and the gym. And
most of us really watch what we eat."</TE>
<TE>   Jody Williams, 28, a San Jose police officer who will also compete
in wrist-wrestling, said her job dictates that she stays in decent
shape: "Being athletic certainly helps you do your job more
effectively. I don't think there's any doubt about that. And this
competition gives us a goal to shoot for each year."</TE>
<TE>   John Stiver, 37, an Orange County probation officer, has come out
of semi-retirement to captain his basketball team at the Salgado
Center in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   "All of us played some in high school and some of us played
college, but we didn't make the NBA," said Stiver, a 6-foot-9,
295-pound center who played at Whittier Christian High and Biola
College. "This our chance to play against our peers in law
enforcement. It makes it tough on the referees because these guys
want to win badly."</TE>

<LD>Catherine Cate recalls with conversational ease the midafternoon
palavers in the courtyard that began as teas and mutated into
margarita-sipping sessions. She remembers the bonhomie of the group,
the comfort of their lives at that point in time and, as part of it
all, her exposure to the somewhat mysterious friend in the
third-floor corner condo who turned out to be someone famous.</LD>
<LD>   It's 20 years gone, but Cate is happily reflecting on her and her
neighbors' times with Philip K. Dick, the science fiction-writer-
thinker-eccentric who helped brighten those midafternoons in the old
Civic Center Plaza apartment complex in Santa Ana.</LD>
<LD>   In the subculture of sci-fi fans who perhaps see the world
differently than other people, Dick resides in the literary pantheon.
A novel of his became the inspiration for the 1982 cult classic
"Blade Runner." A short story inspired "Total Recall" with Arnold
Schwarzenegger and yet another is the source of "Minority Report,"
the Steven Spielberg-Tom Cruise collaboration that is expected to be
a summer blockbuster.</LD>
<TE>   Dick's legend remains intact long after his death, but to Cate and
the small group of other Santa Ana residents who came to know him
before he died in 1982, he was the reclusive but genial neighbor who
rarely flaunted what he did. "If he talked about his writing, I don't
remember," Cate says.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, to the contrary ...</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't let anyone in his place," Cate says. "He was very
reclusive. The only person I know of who went in was a mutual
neighbor."</TE>
<TE>   But Dick was hardly unfriendly. He was just unusual.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a group of us, including Phil, whose schedules allowed
us to be home by 3:30 or 4 in the afternoon," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lovely three-tiered fountain out there in the
courtyard and, one by one, we'd all go sit at the table by the
fountain. We started with tea, then wine, then beer, then we'd be
making margaritas. We'd sit out and chat till it was cold and dark
and we couldn't stand it anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "Phil would come down. I didn't know who this guy was. Pretty
soon, someone told me who he was. He was paranoid. That was one of
the things he made clear early on--'You never heard of me. If anyone
asks about me, you tell them nothing about me and you tell me
immediately.' He wanted all of us to understand that where he lived
was absolutely confidential. He said people had been out to get him.
I got the impression it was either the FBI or the CIA."</TE>
<TE>   If that sounds kooky, Cate says it wasn't off-putting at the time.
Dick's reclusive nature was but another element in the group's
eclecticism.</TE>
<TE>   Dick was already living in the complex in 1980 when Cate and her
husband arrived. Its apartments had just been converted to condos,
and the Cates--who still live just three blocks away--were among the
first ones in.</TE>
<TE>   "Phil chose to buy his condo, but I believe he chose not to have
any renovations done," Cate recalls. "He kept the old green shag
carpeting."</TE>
<TE>   Dick began writing in the early 1950s, but suffered a stroke in
early 1982 and died in March of that year. A Web site biography says
he had "a string of bad marriages and was addicted to drugs."</TE>
<TE>   What Cate remembers from the casual afternoons in the courtyard,
however, was his unique take on the world.</TE>
<TE>   "When Phil started talking, I found myself nodding in agreement,
but his intellect was on such a different plane than most of us that
it was hard in some ways to converse with him. Especially having no
background in science fiction."</TE>
<TE>   But Cate says Dick was no stuffed shirt. He gave her an
autographed book that, as a non-fan, she later gave to a friend who
in turn gave it to someone else. Dick was so insistent on privacy,
Cate says, that rumors sprang up about whether he faked his death.
The last time Cate saw Dick before he died, he was frail and without
vigor, though only 53.</TE>
<TE>   "He died before 'Blade Runner' actually made it to the screen, but
it was in the works," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial services were held at nearby Episcopal Church of the
Messiah. The Rev. Bradford Karelius, who officiated and still serves
the church, remembers that a producer associated with "Blade Runner"
donated $1,000 to a charity for the homeless that Dick also had
supported.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back, Cate says Dick's presence in her midst is symbolic
of how Santa Ana absorbs people from all walks of life.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a perfect example of someone who came to this city and
found a place for himself and was accepted on his terms," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know where he came from. He literally existed for us in a
specific time and place."</TE>

<HD>Patrols to Monitor Use of Fireworks</HD>
<DH>Holiday: Ventura County fire chief is recruiting the
volunteers to help prevent blazes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He can't stop Fillmore from selling fireworks. But Ventura County
Fire Chief Bob Roper has a warning for those who set them off outside
the city: Someone may be watching.</LD>
<LD>   As Southern California faces what may be its worst fire season to
date, the fire chief in this brush-covered county is activating a
brigade of "citizen arson patrols."</LD>
<LD>   Equipped with notepads, pens, radios and cellular phones, about
two dozen volunteers will roam Ojai, Thousand Oaks and other
fire-prone areas during Fourth of July week. They will jot down the
license plate numbers of suspicious vehicles parked in the woods and
call authorities to report any fireworks sightings.</LD>
<TE>   No doubt, some volunteers will face the ire of Independence Day
revelers who will question their patriotism. With the help of his
patrols, Roper said, authorities will confiscate fireworks and issue
citations with a vengeance.</TE>
<TE>   Violators face a maximum fine of $1,000 and up to one year in jail
for unauthorized use of so-called safe-and-sane fireworks. Jail time
and fines of up to $5,000 may be imposed if the fireworks are among
the more powerful kind banned by the state.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to be out there in an enforcement mode more than
we've been in the past," Roper said. Of the wide range of devices he
is prepared to seize, he said, "We don't care whether they're 'safe
and sane' or illegal. They're an ignition source."</TE>
<TE>   In California, the state fire marshal has approved a list of
safe-and-sane fireworks. These are safer than fireworks prohibited by
the state because they do not explode, dart across the ground or lift
into the air. Still, they burn at high temperatures and have started
fires.</TE>
<TE>   Local jurisdictions, however, have the power to ban the sale and
use of all fireworks within their boundaries, including the types
approved by the state. In California, 229 cities allow safe-and-sane
fireworks.</TE>
<TE>   Fireworks Caused Fires</TE>
<TE>   Fillmore is the only city in Ventura County that allows them. In
recent years, at least nine fires throughout the county have been
sparked by fireworks, with the largest burning 4,300 acres in the
Ojai Valley in 1999. Firefighting costs have totaled more than $5.6
million.</TE>
<TE>   For years, residents throughout the county and the San Fernando
Valley have flocked to Fillmore's fireworks booths, run by civic
groups, to stock up for block parties in their own neighborhoods.
They are violating the law, but it's a law authorities say is
difficult to enforce.</TE>
<TE>   This year, California, Colorado and other Western states have been
swept by brush fires, including a 22,000-acre blaze that began June 1
in Los Padres National Forest north of Ojai. As a result, Roper said
he is serious about keeping fireworks away from amateurs.</TE>
<TE>   The county Board of Supervisors earlier this month urged Fillmore
officials to halt roadside sales altogether. City officials declined,
arguing that it is unfair to punish local civic groups that earn
thousands of dollars from fireworks sales. They also said banning
safe-and-sane fireworks would only encourage use of the illegal kind.</TE>
<TE>   With no power to regulate sales in Fillmore, Roper has shifted his
focus to fireworks enthusiasts who live outside the city. He printed
25,000 fliers--which the city has agreed to distribute with each
fireworks purchase--notifying customers that their items can be
confiscated the minute they leave Fillmore's city limits.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities won't be pulling drivers over to inspect their trunks.
But if the citizen arson patrol spots anyone with fireworks, it's
their job to report them.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the patrols were culled from the county sheriff's disaster
assistance teams and have training dealing with earthquakes, fires
and searches for missing people. Fire Department spokeswoman Sandi
Wells said the county's first arson patrol was formed in 1993, after
a spate of fires burned across eastern portions of the county.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, volunteers have been called out a few times but keep a
low profile. No arrests have been made based on tips from the
patrols, but Wells said this year's is the best-organized effort yet.</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks resident Helen Tallen is one of the volunteers. The
50-year-old Montessori school teacher leads her local disaster
assistance response team. She has searched for missing people and
helped authorities manage a compost fire, but this will be her first
stint on the arson patrol.</TE>
<TE>   Tallen has fond memories of July 4 celebrations, but also
remembers, as a little girl, injuring her father when he gave her a
sparkler to play with.</TE>
<TE>   Too Many Homes at Risk</TE>
<TE>   "If they're in the wrong hands, they're dangerous," Tallen said.
"This is such an extreme drought time for us. It's nothing to be
playing with, especially this year."</TE>
<TE>   She isn't expecting any grief from neighbors. On the contrary,
Tallen said, homeowners will be thanking her.</TE>
<TE>   "We're right up against the wilderness," she said. "Everybody in
this neighborhood is very much on the same page. No fireworks. Nobody
wants to see this neighborhood go up in flames, and we could very
easily."</TE>

<HD>Sisters Allege Abuse by Transferred Priest</HD>
<DH>Church: Three women say archdiocese moved Father G. Neville
Rucker in 1970 after other allegations. He was ousted in April.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three sisters are alleging they were molested as youngsters by a
priest after the Los Angeles archdiocese transferred him to their
parish despite knowing allegations of abuse had been made against the
priest in the past.</LD>
<LD>   The sisters allege they were abused by Father G. Neville Rucker in
the early 1970s at St. Agatha Church in Los Angeles' West Adams
district. They are demanding an apology from Cardinal Roger M. Mahony
and a face-to-face meeting with the now-retired priest.</LD>
<LD>   Rucker came to St. Agatha in 1970, three years after two
9-year-old girls told the El Segundo police that the cleric molested
them while he was at St. Anthony Church, police records show.</LD>
<TE>   Rucker retired in 1987. In April, Mahony removed him from the
ministry because of the 1967 allegations and forced him to move out
of the Pacific Palisades rectory, saying Rucker had run afoul of the
archdiocese's new zero tolerance policy for priests who molest
minors.</TE>
<TE>   Rucker's removal came 35 years after Mahony's
predecessor--then-Bishop Timothy Manning--persuaded the mother of one
of the El Segundo girls not to seek criminal charges against Rucker,
records show.</TE>
<TE>   The mother told police Manning had assured her "he would like the
Church to take care of the matter, and he would see that it was done
properly," according to a police report.</TE>
<TE>   The Times' report of Rucker's removal from the ministry in April
caused one of the sisters who claim he molested them at St. Agatha to
go to the police.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Police Lt. Daniel Mulrenin said the publicity caused
others to call, and detectives now are investigating "several"
reports of abuse by Rucker.</TE>
<TE>   "After all these years, I hoped he'd died of natural causes," said
the middle sister, now 40. The recent report of Rucker's removal
"forced me to relive some horrible memories. They are memories I'll
never forget. I locked them away. I prayed no one would open that
door. Now I learn he's done it before. I just want to know, why did
they let it happen?" The Times does not name alleged sex crime
victims.</TE>
<TE>   Rucker, who lives in a Catholic retirement facility in West Los
Angeles, refused to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The sister recalls Rucker as the pastor who liked to share
cookies, hugs and touches in places that she could not tell anyone
about. She and her sisters said the abuse occurred for parts of two
years, 1973 and 1974. Then, one night, overhearing her mother say how
glad she was her children attended St. Agatha's school, the girl
blurted out her secret.</TE>
<TE>   After that night, she and her mother said, her father marched down
to the rectory and confronted parish officials.</TE>
<TE>   Tod Tamberg, archdiocese spokesman, acknowledged that Rucker was
transferred after the 1967 El Segundo molestation claim.</TE>
<TE>   Rucker told El Segundo police he was innocent. One of the two
alleged victims, whose mother agreed not to press charges, sued
Rucker and the archdiocese in 1993. Two years later, the priest
settled the lawsuit with a confidential $20,000 payment. In the
settlement agreement, he maintained his innocence.</TE>
<TE>   Rucker's name was turned over to authorities early this year,
Tamberg said. Los Angeles police and sheriff's deputies now are
investigating allegations against 50 current or former priests.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the growing number of complaints, the archdiocese this week
revamped its clergy misconduct review board. An attorney for the
three sisters said he sent a letter Monday to the board's chairman ,
retired Judge Richard P. Byrne, and to Mahony. The attorney, Arthur
Goldberg, said he requested an apology from the cardinal, an
explanation for why Rucker was allowed to continue as a cleric after
the 1967 abuse complaint, and a face-to-face meeting with the priest
so the women can "confront their demons."</TE>
<TE>   "What is disturbing to these now mature women is that officials of
the Catholic Church knew as early as the 1960s that Father Rucker was
a sexual predator of young girls," Goldberg wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg also asked for the church to cover therapy costs, issue a
public declaration on a zero tolerance policy and provide financial
compensation to the victims for their "pain and suffering." "These
women are not seeking revenge. They will work as long as it takes to
achieve justice."</TE>
<TE>   Four days after the police closed the 1967 case, the archdiocese
transferred Rucker to St. Teresa of Avila in Los Angeles, then to
Holy Trinity Church in Los Angeles and Holy Cross Church and
eventually to St. Agatha Church in July 1970.</TE>
<TE>   At St. Agatha, the middle sister said, "Rucker would take me to
the rectory. He'd give me an oatmeal cookie. He'd be smiling and
talking and then reach inside my panties."</TE>
<TE>   She said it left her scarred mentally and struggling with her
faith. Seven years ago, she said, she went on a pilgrimage to
Venezuela in hopes of forgiving Rucker and restoring her trust in
priests. Today, she attends the Faithful Central Baptist Church,
which holds its services at the Forum, but she says her fear and
depression have turned to anger. "I want him charged," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her younger sister said she suppressed her memories of Rucker
until she was told about his ousting by Mahony this year. "I'd never
talked to anyone about this. I remember going into the rectory with
him and him touching me," the 37-year-old woman alleges.</TE>
<TE>   The oldest of the sisters said Rucker was always "over friendly"
with her. "He'd pull me close," she said. "We did not say anything
because he was the priest."</TE>
<TE>   What happened when their father went to see parish officials
remains unclear because he is dead. "My husband went to the church,
and we never saw the priest after that," said the sisters' mother.</TE>
<TE>   Rucker was the pastor assigned to St. Agatha Church until 1979,
when he became pastor at Corpus Christi Church in Pacific Palisades.</TE>

<HD>Teen Admits School Killings</HD>
<DH>Courts: He could be sentenced to life in prison for
shooting rampage that also wounded 11 classmates and two adults.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EL CAJON</DL>
<LD>Charles "Andy" Williams, 16, pleaded guilty Thursday to murdering two
fellow students and wounding 11 others and two adults in a six-minute
shooting rampage at Santana High School last year that traumatized a
community and added to the agonized national debate about the causes
of youth violence.</LD>
<LD>   Williams faces life in prison when he is sentenced Aug. 15 on two
counts of murder and 13 counts of attempted murder. A teacher and
campus monitor were also wounded in the attack.</LD>
<LD>   "Andy wants to make a statement to the community that he is truly
remorseful," defense attorney Randy Mize said. "He did not want to
cause the victims, their families, or his family any other pain" by
going to trial.</LD>
<TE>   Peter Ruiz, a campus supervisor who was shot three times by
Williams, said he believes the teenager should be sentenced to life
in prison, not the minimum term, which is 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   "If he gets the minimum 50 years, after 50 years will the two
young men he murdered come back to their families?" Ruiz said. "Are
my scars and wounds going to be gone?"</TE>
<TE>   No longer the short, frail, timid-looking teenager captured by
police in a school bathroom minutes after the rampage, Williams has
grown several inches, added weight and wears his black, wavy hair
swept back.</TE>
<TE>   He smiled briefly at his father, Jeff Williams, a civilian lab
technician at the Balboa Naval Hospital, and answered "guilty" when
asked about his plea to 15 felony counts by Judge Herbert Exharos.</TE>
<TE>   Several victims and family members wept in the packed courtroom in
eastern San Diego County.</TE>
<TE>   "The events of today have reinforced our confidence in the justice
system in the United States," said Dr. Rufino Macagba, the
grandfather of one of the slain students, Bryan Zuckor, 14.</TE>
<TE>   Using a .22-caliber revolver owned by his father, Williams fired
30 random shots shortly after arriving at the school in the
blue-collar suburb of Santee on the morning of March 5, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Despite enhanced security measures and months of counseling at the
school, students, teachers and others continue to be in pain,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a phenomenal amount of collateral damage done by
this," Deputy Dist. Atty. Kris Anton said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   "We have teachers who cannot teach, kids who are afraid to go to
school, kids who have panic attacks whenever they hear helicopters or
police sirens."</TE>
<TE>   Friends portrayed Williams as a lonely, introverted youth who felt
isolated and bullied by other students.</TE>
<TE>   He and his father had recently moved to Santee from Twentynine
Palms, where the father worked for a year at Joshua Tree National
Park, collecting fees.</TE>
<TE>   The father and son had moved to Twentynine Palms from Brunswick,
Md.</TE>
<TE>   The younger Williams never adjusted to moving to California and
leaving his friends behind, friends said. Once an honor student, he
began failing classes and smoking marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   In the days before the shooting, Williams told friends he planned
to take his father's gun to school and kill some people--but his
friends dismissed the comment as the kind of sick humor that is
popular with teenagers drawn to gothic and drug cliques.</TE>
<TE>   After he surrendered, Williams told police he had planned to
commit suicide after the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' rampage set off a wave of concern in the media and among
parents and school officials nationwide about bullying as a trigger
of violence. Numerous districts began anti-bullying programs.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors said the explanation that Williams, a freshman,
was lashing back because he was bullied did not match the facts.</TE>
<TE>   "We could not find evidence that he was picked on by other
students," said Anton, the prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   "He hung out with a group of punks who liked to smoke marijuana
and drink and give each other a hard time. But those were his friends
of choice; kids who remembered him from class saw him as a kind of
class clown," Anton said.</TE>
<TE>   While still grieving from the Santana shooting, the community was
again stunned 17 days later by a shooting at another school in the
Grossmont Union High School District.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Hoffman, 18, a moody, hulking senior with a history of
mental problems and failed aspirations, wounded five people at
Granite Hills High School in El Cajon.</TE>
<TE>   While awaiting trial, he hanged himself in the San Diego jail.</TE>
<TE>   His family is suing the Sheriff's Department for not preventing
him from killing himself despite knowing that he was suicidal.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego County Dist. Atty. Paul Pfingst fought a successful
battle to the California Supreme Court for the right to prosecute
Williams as an adult in Superior Court, rather than in Juvenile
Court, where sentences are lighter.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys said that Proposition 21, the ballot measure
that gives prosecutors greater authority to try juveniles as adults,
is unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   After he is sentenced, Williams will be sent to state prison and
kept in a special section for inmates younger than 18.</TE>
<TE>   When he turns 18 he will be housed with other adult inmates.</TE>
<TE>   After the two shootings, the Grossmont district formed the Lessons
Commission, which made numerous recommendations about boosting
security, increasing contact between parents and school officials,
and redoubling efforts to help troubled teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   Commission member Sandra McBrayer, a former national Teacher of
the Year and now director of the San Diego-based Children's
Initiative, praised the Grossmont district for its response to the
tragedies.</TE>
<TE>   But she also worried that another Andy Williams could occur at
nearly any school in the country because of the paucity of counseling
and psychological assistance for troubled students and the easy
access to guns.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at Andy and my heart breaks," McBrayer said. "How could we
have identified his problems earlier?"</TE>

<HD>3 Minority Business Groups to Fight Secession</HD>
<DH>Breakup: A committee targeting Latino voters in East L.A.
forms to help keep Los Angeles whole.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The campaign against San Fernando Valley and Hollywood secession
picked up the support Thursday of three minority business
organizations and a new committee that will target Latino voters in
East Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Councilman Nick Pacheco, who represents the Eastside, filed papers
to form One Los Angeles for Everyone, nicknamed OLE, to raise money
for the anti-secession fight.</LD>
<LD>   "The Eastside has one of the largest pockets of Latino votes in
the city, and I really believe that we are going to be the margin of
victory in this anti-secession effort," Pacheco said. "So I want to
make sure these Latino voters understand the pitfalls of being a
smaller city."</LD>
<TE>   The councilman said that if the city is made smaller by the loss
of the Valley and Hollywood, Los Angeles will have a more difficult
time winning federal money for anti-gang efforts, low-income housing
and other programs. Secession measures for the two areas are on the
Nov. 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The business groups will announce today that they are joining the
anti-secession campaign headed by Mayor James K. Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   The Greater Los Angeles African-American Chamber of Commerce, the
Latin Business Assn. and the Asian Business League of Southern
California say they are concerned that new cities will bring more
regulations and higher taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of our members are immigrants--they came here because of
the opportunities that this city provides," said Curtis Jung,
chairman of the Asian Business League. "We just want to keep the
status quo."</TE>
<TE>   If Los Angeles were made smaller by the secession of the Valley,
"people would be laid off and services would be cut," said Gene Hale,
chairman of the African-American Chamber. He also said that a
splintered Los Angeles might have a difficult time persuading major
corporations to open stores and other businesses in inner-city areas.</TE>
<TE>   Hale said he thought it "ludicrous" that some African-American
voters were considering supporting secession because Hahn opposed
Bernard Parks' bid for a second term as police chief. "We have to
transcend emotional politics and get down to the basics of what's
really good for the African-American business community," Hale said.</TE>
<TE>   Political consultant Kam Kuwata, who is running the mayor's
campaign, said Thursday's developments were the result of months of
work by Hahn and his allies to reach out to minorities.</TE>
<TE>   But Richard Katz, chairman of the pro-secession campaign, said
that the three business groups were close to downtown interests and
could be expected to support the mayor's campaign. "There are lots of
good people who belong to those groups, but in those organizations
you're going to find leadership groups that are heavily involved with
City Hall," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Durazo, vice chairman of the Latin Business Assn., said his
group's 800 members are mostly small businesses throughout the city.</TE>
<TE>   "We have members in the Valley, we have members in East L.A., and
we have members in Hollywood," Durazo said. "Our headquarters are in
East Los Angeles on Olympic Boulevard near Atlantic [Boulevard].
That's a long way from downtown."</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, a lawyer for the city's largest municipal labor
union filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court that seeks to
halt the secession election.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Hunt, general counsel for Service Employees International
Union's Local 347, served notice Wednesday that he would file the
suit.</TE>

<HD>City to Further Staunch Stench</HD>
<DH>Sanitation: Neighbors are breathing easier as Ventura plans
new odor controls for a sewage treatment facility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICA BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although neighbors say it's better than it used to be, the smell from
the Ventura sewage plant still wrinkles a few noses now and then.</LD>
<LD>   "It's just a really bad stink," said Kaye Aina, general manager of
the Four Points Sheraton at the harbor. But Aina acknowledged the
foul odor has become less intense over the years and so have
complaints from hotel guests.</LD>
<LD>   That is good news for the city.</LD>
<TE>   But getting rid of the smell generated by the 9 million gallons of
waste water that passes through the plant daily is expensive. The
city is preparing to implement new odor controls to further stem the
stench. The cost: $4 million.</TE>
<TE>   "We're interested in making certain that we're not a source of
odors," said Don Davis, the city's utility manager.</TE>
<TE>   The plant uses carbon filtration and sulfur-eating microorganisms
to turn dirty water into clear, odorless H2O before it is released
into the Santa Clara River estuary.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the new project, the city wants to cover four open-air
tanks that hold 4 million gallons of partially treated effluent. The
money for the project will come mainly from user fees.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said the covers will help further reduce fumes emitted from
the plant. "We work here every day so we don't really notice the
smell beyond the immediate vicinity," Davis said. "We don't think
neighbors even notice it, although there is always the possibility
under the right winds and the right atmospheric conditions."</TE>
<TE>   Aina, manager of the Sheraton, said hotel guests used to complain
about the smell as often as two or three times a week.</TE>
<TE>   "They would ask, 'What is that smell?' We would tell them that
there is a water-treatment plant and a mushroom farm nearby," Aina
said. But in the past year, he said, those complaints have dropped
off considerably. And the smell, which is most noticeable in the
early morning, is not as strong, he added.</TE>
<TE>   There is another incentive for the city to reduce the smell at the
sewage plant, formally known as the Ventura Water Reclamation
Facility.</TE>
<TE>   The city wants to build a $700,000 public arts project behind the
plant, near Ventura Harbor and surrounding wetlands. One proposal
calls for developing an educational park that would attract tourists
and bird-watchers.</TE>
<TE>   The park would include walkways and viewing stands around the
plant's three ponds of treated effluent. Area wetlands are home to
the great blue heron and other migratory birds.</TE>
<TE>   Kerry Adams Hapner, the city's public arts supervisor, described
the project as "an artistic approach to public amenities."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Dan Pfeifer, the city's waste water superintendent,
said while covering the sewage plant's storage tanks will help reduce
odors, it could also mean an extra $142,000 in annual operating costs
for removing the stinking air trapped inside the tanks.</TE>
<TE>   But that is the price of being a good neighbor, he said.</TE>

<HD>Sheriff Releases 1,200 Nonviolent Offenders</HD>
<DH>Budget: Baca, in financial battle with supervisors, will
also close some programs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sheriff Lee Baca has released more than 1,200 inmates convicted of
nonviolent misdemeanors since last week as he seeks to close a budget
gap of as much as $100 million, department officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Assistant Sheriff Dennis Dahlman said the releases that began June
13 are part of an effort to reduce a chronic budget shortfall.</LD>
<LD>   The releases come as a budget battle between Baca and the county
supervisors intensifies.</LD>
<TE>   Under the new policy, inmates convicted of nonviolent misdemeanors
who have served 70% of their jail sentences have been released, said
Cmdr. Chuck Jackson, who oversees the jail.</TE>
<TE>   Inmates often are released early for good behavior. But, Jackson
said, "This is earlier than they earn with good time, work time." As
of midnight Wednesday, 1,215 had been released, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department on Thursday issued directives to
commanders and deputies that Baca's budget, effective July 1, would
preserve most core crime-fighting units but close the Century
Regional Detention Facility in Lynwood, eliminate the Asian Crime
Task Force and require the release of inmates with bail of less than
$25,000 who are not charged with felonies or violent misdemeanors.</TE>
<TE>   Those releases will be especially important if the 2,000-bed
Century Regional jail closes July 1, as Baca on Thursday reiterated
that it would.</TE>
<TE>   Its inmates are to be transferred, filling spaces of inmates
released early. About 184 deputies there were informed late Wednesday
that they would be reassigned, with only a skeleton crew left for
bookings and maintenance, Dahlman said.</TE>
<TE>   Spared the ax by Baca are the Safe Streets Bureau, the Emergency
Services Detail, the Mental Health Evaluation team and the Family
Crimes Bureau, which is handling dozens of cases involving
allegations of sexual misconduct by priests.</TE>
<TE>   Also preserved was the controversial use of a $2.4 million
airplane by the department.</TE>
<TE>   Baca's plans come as county supervisors prepared to decide how
much is needed to run a department that has nearly 15,000 employees
and jails with 20,000 inmates, and which polices 41 cities and
unincorporated areas of the county. Supervisors will vote on the
Sheriff's Department budget next week.</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff slated several programs for closing in two to four
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Among them is the COPS Bureau, a community policing program whose
175 deputies are to be reassigned to fill positions currently staffed
using overtime.</TE>

<HD>A Last-Ditch Approach to Smog</HD>
<DH>Air: San Joaquin Valley seeks dirtiest designation to buy
time for cleanup and avoid penalties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The San Joaquin Valley is about to become the first region in the
nation to voluntarily label its atmosphere extremely polluted, a move
that buys more time for industry to cut smog but imposes a stigma the
valley will bear for the remainder of the decade.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District
board decided it will request the designation by Sept. 18, the latest
possible opportunity to avoid financial penalties. It also ordered
development of a new anti-smog plan to guide local, state and federal
authorities on a path to clean air by 2010.</LD>
<LD>   "It is an unprecedented action, a very serious action. It's the
first area in the country to have made this commitment," said Amy
Zimpfer, deputy director for air programs in the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency's California office.</LD>
<TE>   Threatened with the hammer of federal penalties, local air quality
officials are confronted with a Hobson's choice. "Business as usual"
would guarantee economic sanctions, the penalty the Clean Air Act
requires of places that don't clean up on schedule.</TE>
<TE>   The only way to avoid that is to buy time by asking the federal
government to declare air over the 25,000-square-mile valley
extremely polluted.</TE>
<TE>   That's a designation that until now applied only to the Los
Angeles Basin's filthy skies. Los Angeles was designated so polluted
by the Clean Air Act.</TE>
<TE>   The decision is the clearest signal yet that the valley's
anti-smog program is in serious trouble. Air quality officials missed
a key 1999 ozone cleanup target and got a six-year extension last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Then they announced this spring that they could not meet the
revised deadline and needed five extra years--and possibly
more--before they could trim enough emissions to comply with even the
most minimal federal standards.</TE>
<TE>   The designation would broaden regulations to include food
processors, small power plants and painting operations, which would
be required to get pollution permits.</TE>
<TE>   More facilities, in general, would be required to use the best
available smog controls, while new and expanding businesses could be
required to secure additional "offsets" from other polluters. Offsets
are a type of credit that one polluter acquires from another to
compensate for emissions.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the prospect of more regulation, business leaders
applauded the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very pleased with the board's decision today. This will
maintain local control and allow a collaborative approach. This is
the best option we have," said Suzanne Noble, an oil industry
representative with the business-oriented San Joaquin Valley Air
Quality Coalition.</TE>
<TE>   However, environmentalists condemned air quality officials for a
decision that would postpone by five years the date when the region
must comply with federal smog standards.</TE>
<TE>   "This is terrible news for everyone with respiratory problems in
the Central Valley," said Ann Harper, an attorney for the
Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund, which has sued air quality agencies
over valley smog.</TE>
<TE>   "This foot-dragging shows what happens when regulators avoid
difficult decisions for decades," she said. "This shows how clearly
the air district's governing board members are in the pocket of the
big agriculture and oil industries."</TE>
<TE>   But business groups said the local air quality agency had little
choice. Without a change in the smog designation, the EPA was poised
to cut off millions of dollars in federal highway funds, take over
valley smog-control programs and impose measures to restrict economic
expansion.</TE>
<TE>   California's heartland, long associated with sunshine and food
crops, is today suffused with soot and gases. Pollution comes from
farm equipment and oil refineries, clouds of dusty cow dung and auto
tailpipes, diesel trucks and food processing plants.</TE>
<TE>   What gains have been made pale in comparison to those achieved in
major cities with far more people, cars and business. Blame lies with
lax regulation, growth and a merciless climate that pushes pollution
to smothering levels for many of the valley's 2.5 million residents.</TE>
<TE>   Air quality officials say at least 300 tons of smog-forming

<HD>Homes Urged at Site of Scuttled Stadium</HD>
<DH>Downtown: Ohio firm proposes 2,600 units where Anschutz
group tried to lure NFL team.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT and MITCHELL LANDSBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With Denver billionaire Phil Anschutz and his allies backing away
from efforts to build a 64,000-seat football stadium near Staples
Center, a Cleveland-based development company unveiled plans Thursday
to transform the area into a residential community with 2,600 housing
units, several parks and a school.</LD>
<LD>   Greg Vilkin, the West Coast president of Forest City Inc., told
members of the Central City Assn. that his company wants to build
market-rate and affordable housing on a nine-block swath of the South
Park area in downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Vilkin made his announcement during a luncheon at the Biltmore
Hotel, less than a week after Tim Leiweke, the president of Anschutz
Entertainment Group, said his company would withdraw its plans to
build a football stadium in South Park. The company had hoped to
persuade a National Football League team to relocate to the new
stadium.</LD>
<TE>   Speculation had persisted that the Anschutz group would try to
build the stadium anyway and was just announcing its cancellation as
a ploy. In response, Leiweke said this week that the Anschutz group
had begun to let go of options to buy property on the proposed
stadium site.</TE>
<TE>   "If we were bluffing," he said in an interview Wednesday, "that
wouldn't be a very smart thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   Vilkin's announcement strapped another muzzle on the stadium talk,
although he stressed that his housing plan is far from complete. He
said he has long considered building homes on South Park land now
occupied by parking lots and old warehouses. Under Forest City's
proposal, the company would develop land stretching from Olympic
Boulevard to Pico Boulevard and from Flower Street to Hill Street.</TE>
<TE>   The nine-block area--which encompasses the 16 acres where Anschutz
wanted to build the stadium--is part of an 879-acre redevelopment
zone created by Los Angeles City Council in May.</TE>
<TE>   The special district was set up to allow the Community
Redevelopment Agency to funnel new property tax funds back into the
area, to condemn and acquire land and to relocate residents and
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed development would help meet one of the agency's
primary goals: creating as many as 12,900 homes, a quarter of which
would be affordable, over the next 30 to 45 years.</TE>
<TE>   Vilkin said the plan was intended to "spark discussion and debate
about the appropriate uses in South Park."</TE>
<TE>   He said it would be more than a year--and possibly several
years--before the company could break ground on the project if it
were approved. "We are giving people a choice on the vision for the
area," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Vilkin said he has met council members and Mayor James K.
Hahn to discuss the plans. Hahn, who strongly backed Anschutz's
stadium efforts, could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Jan Perry, who had also supported the stadium plan,
said she welcomed the housing proposal. "Although the stadium
proposal has been put to rest, for now, we have to make sure we
pursue the highest and best use of the land in the South Park area,"
Perry said.</TE>
<TE>   Vilkin refused to disclose if he was seeking to acquire land held
by Anschutz, whose company still owns some parcels in the area. He
did say, however, that he hoped to purchase some of the parcels for
the proposed development with the help of the city's Community
Redevelopment Agency, which has the ability to acquire land through
eminent domain.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to working on projects in downtown Los Angeles, Forest
City has been pursuing a number of developments in other cities. The
company was chosen to transform Denver's former Stapleton
International Airport into a 4,700-acre mixed-use urban community.</TE>
<TE>   The company also helped renovate New York's Times Square.
Currently, it is building a new headquarters for the New York Times
and is redeveloping Chicago's old rail yards.</TE>
<TE>   As for the Anschutz group, Leiweke said the company is moving on
to other projects, in particular an entertainment district anchored
by a major convention hotel and 7,000-seat theater in the area
surrounding Staples Center and the Los Angeles Convention Center.</TE>
<TE>   "We're busy," Leiweke said. "We've got a lot going on." Returning
to the stadium plan, he added: "Will we come back to this one? I'm
not sure I see any scenario that would make me believe we would."</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke said there was no single event or opponent that halted the
football project, but rather a combination of several. These included
a lawsuit that Los Angeles County is planning to file against the
city over the creation of the downtown redevelopment zone; opposition
by several members of the City Council and county Board of
Supervisors, including Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky; and a decision by
the Coliseum Commission to pursue an NFL franchise.</TE>
<TE>   The entertainment district remains the company's top priority,
Leiweke added, and officials of the Anschutz group were worried that
opposition to the stadium--in particular the county's lawsuit--could
threaten plans for the hotel, which would be the linchpin of the
development.</TE>
<TE>   "The hotel's tied into the [Community Redevelopment Agency].
Without the CRA, we have a problem with the hotel. And that's why
we're anxious for the city and county to resolve whatever differences
they have," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Among those with a political stake in the stadium proposal was
Hahn, who supported the plan while insisting the city would not spend
public money on it. Leiweke insisted that he didn't mean any slight
to Hahn when he complained about a lack of political support.</TE>
<TE>   "The one person in this whole process that we owe a debt of
gratitude toward is the mayor," Leiweke said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that "simply out of respect to him," he would not
completely rule out the possibility of the stadium plan someday being
revived.</TE>

<HD>Union Fights Increases in Class Sizes</HD>
<DH>Schools: Teachers oppose cost-cutting plan that would raise
the number of students, saying the district must first negotiate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUKE HELFAND and SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles teachers union is fighting a cost-cutting proposal to
increase class sizes to 40 or more students in the secondary grades.</LD>
<LD>   United Teachers-Los Angeles has filed a complaint with a state
labor board alleging unfair practice, accusing the Los Angeles
Unified School District of illegally deciding to expand classes
without negotiating the changes.</LD>
<LD>   The union on Tuesday asked the state Public Employment Relations
Board to seek a court injunction halting the district's plan to add
two students to most classes in grades four to 12.</LD>
<TE>   The class-size changes, adopted by the Board of Education in April
for a saving of $70 million, are scheduled to start next month in
more than 200 year-round schools. It will be extended to the entire
district in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   The employment board is expected to consider the injunction
request next week.</TE>
<TE>   Union officials said that larger classes would unduly burden
teachers and possibly put those who work with emotionally disturbed
children in harm's way.</TE>
<TE>   "This will decrease the amount of attention students can get from
teachers," said the union president, Day Higuchi.</TE>
<TE>   District officials say that the teachers' contract allows them to
increase class sizes without negotiating if there are state funding
cuts, as has happened in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, officials argue that virtually all the larger classes
will remain within the various limits for different grades mandated
by the teachers' contract.</TE>
<TE>   Under the district's plan, fourth and fifth grade classes would
average between 32 and 38; the average size of middle school classes
would increase to 41 students; the average size of most high school
classes would range from 32 to more than 40.</TE>
<TE>   Special education classes, which serve as few as three students,
also would increase by two.</TE>
<TE>   "In our view, we had some room to expand class sizes under the
contract," said Hal Kwalwasser, the district's general counsel. "It
doesn't require negotiation."</TE>
<TE>   The fight over class sizes--and money for teacher raises--also is
flaring on another front.</TE>
<TE>   Union leaders have refused to help the district select teachers to
serve as literacy and math coaches in schools. Higuchi said these
veteran instructors should remain in classrooms to keep class sizes
down, saving the district money for teacher health benefits and
raises.</TE>
<TE>   Supt. Roy Romer credits the coaching program with improving
students' test scores in recent years. Higuchi says the effort has
been poorly administered.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides continued to squabble Thursday, even as the Board of
Education approved $4.8 million in cuts to help cover an estimated
$430 million shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   The district's budget gap is the result of rising costs for
special education and worker's compensation and cuts in state
funding.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Unified will save $4.5 million from a program that gives
bonuses to teachers who acquire special certification. The district
will use state and federal grants instead. The same approach will
save an additional $300,000 used for athletics administrators'
salaries.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Unified still has to shave $10 million to balance its
$5.9-billion general fund budget. In addition, Romer said, the
district will need to find $30 million to pay for the rising cost of
teachers' health benefits.</TE>

<HD>For Battered Women Behind Bars, New Hope</HD>
<DH>Volunteers work to free those convicted of killing abusive
partners before syndrome was recognized in California.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA LOH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marva Wallace says the night she shot her husband, he had forced her
to perform a sexual act in front of their 2-year-old daughter. During
a yearlong marriage, he beat her so often that she recalls sporting a
black eye "like it was part of my makeup."</LD>
<LD>   When Jeanette Crawford killed her husband, she had gone into their
bedroom intending to shoot herself in front of him but changed her
mind. Her lawyers say her action resulted from five years of physical
abuse, including being forced to have sex with other women.</LD>
<LD>   Wallace and Crawford were convicted in the 1980s, before battered
women's syndrome was recognized as a defense by California courts.</LD>
<TE>   Both women have been serving what could amount to life terms in
state prison. Today, they see a glimmer at the end of the tunnel.</TE>
<TE>   Making use of a new state law, a group of legal advocates has
mobilized volunteers to help Wallace, Crawford and dozens of other
female inmates across the state challenge their convictions.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Bill 799, enacted in January, gives inmates convicted
before 1992 the right to file habeas corpus petitions to overturn
their convictions on the grounds that battered women's syndrome
evidence was not used in their defense.</TE>
<TE>   It was not until 1992 that California courts were required to
admit expert testimony about the syndrome, which refers to the
effects of repeated physical and psychological abuse. The 1992
change--and a 1996 state Supreme Court ruling allowing for acquittals
of battered women who acted in self-defense--has helped many women in
more current cases avoid murder convictions.</TE>
<TE>   The state Board of Prison Terms is investigating claims from about
100 women who say their crimes should have been mitigated by evidence
of domestic abuse, said chief investigator David McAuley. The board,
which evaluates inmates for parole, has found that battered women's
syndrome was a factor in 14 cases so far.</TE>
<TE>   There are 442 women in the state prison system for pre-1992
convictions for murder or attempted murder, though not necessarily of
a spouse. Advocates for battered women say many of those inmates may
be eligible to have their cases reexamined.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent evening, two dozen attorneys gathered around a large
conference table in a law office on the Westside of Los Angeles to
learn about the new law and be matched with the files of inmates they
have volunteered to assist.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-six inmates from the California Institution for Women in
Corona--ages 35 to 65--have been selected for assistance by the
project's organizers, the California Women's Law Center, USC's
Post-Conviction Justice Project and the California Coalition for
Battered Women in Prison.</TE>
<TE>   In a scene that smacked of a college study session, the pro bono
lawyers--many of them young and with little criminal law
experience--munched on pizza as they listened to advocates and
criminal defense experts.</TE>
<TE>   The organizers began with a pep talk.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope that you'll get to see yourselves as part of a growing
movement," said Olivia Wang, a staff attorney with the battered women
coalition. "What happens here in California very likely is going to
start a trend nationwide."</TE>
<TE>   The California law is unique, organizers say, and could prompt
similar legislation elsewhere. The California movement to treat
battered women killers with leniency was fueled by a decision of
former Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste to pardon 26 such inmates in 1990.
In California, the only two killers released on parole by Gov. Gray
Davis have been two women who had been abused by men they later
killed.</TE>
<TE>   How-to booklets and sample petitions like the ones that will be
filed on the inmates' behalf were handed around the table.</TE>
<TE>   The volunteers were instructed to include the woman's complete
story in the petition. You have only one chance to get the court's
attention, they were told. Don't assume that a judge will know or
care about your case.</TE>
<TE>   "With some of our clients, they've been in prison for so long that
the judges [who presided over their cases] have long since died,"
said Mike Brennan, a criminal law professor in the post-conviction
project at USC. "Sometimes that's a help," he added, eliciting
chuckles.</TE>
<TE>   The organizers plan to visit the state's three other women's
prisons soon in search of additional inmates who may benefit from the
new law.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the volunteer lawyers say personal experiences have made
them want to help.</TE>
<TE>   Commercial litigation attorney Andrea Diallo, 31, said the
inmates' stories revived the pain she felt as a child, watching a
relative suffer in an abusive marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Diallo said she was eager to meet her future client, Susan, who
shot her live-in boyfriend in 1988 after enduring repeated rape and
imprisonment. Prosecutors used the evidence of domestic abuse to
argue that Susan had a motive to kill. "That is so degrading, to have
to live through that, and then to have it brought up to use against
you as your reason for killing somebody," Diallo said.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica Mayer, a recent Harvard Law School graduate, said her
experience as a rape hotline operator in college has helped her
understand why women who are repeatedly raped by their spouses may
believe killing is their only option.</TE>
<TE>   Her client's trucker husband raped her and forced her to perform
sex acts with animals until the day she shot him in his sleep, Mayer
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that being raped is a kind of death," she said. "There's
only so much a woman can take before you've effectively killed her,
even if she's still breathing."</TE>
<TE>   Although the mood among the lawyers and activists was one of
optimism, they also were told that evidence of battering isn't
necessarily a ticket to freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Kay Duffy, a Ventura-based criminal defense lawyer, recently lost
a case defending a woman who killed her abusive husband of 15 years,
then dismembered and burned his body.</TE>
<TE>   Duffy believes that although evidence of the battering was
presented, the jury was swayed by grisly photographs of the husband's
remains. She said she isn't going to allow the defeat to discourage
her from defending others. She picked up two inmates' cases at the
training session.</TE>
<TE>   "All of these women I have worked with, they are very strong,
courageous women who [were] put in a bad situation and dealt with it
as best they could," Duffy said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not criminals. They're victims themselves."</TE>

<HD>No Idle Boast: L.A. Traffic Worst--Again</HD>
<DH>Congestion: That's 15 years straight in study. The average
area driver was stuck for 136 hours.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's another repeat performance for Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   No, not the three-time NBA champion Lakers. For the 15th year in a
row, L.A. has claimed the title of the most traffic-choked urban area
in the nation.</LD>
<LD>   The region won the unenviable ranking in an annual traffic
mobility study released Thursday by the Texas Transportation
Institute. The study calculated that Los Angeles-area motorists spent
an average of 136 hours in rush-hour congestion in 2000--an increase
of two hours over 1999. It also estimated that 75% of the area's
freeways and streets are clogged during commute times--another
statistic that leads the nation.</LD>
<TE>   By all estimates, Los Angeles is ready to 16-peat.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I could say that there are fixes that could make L.A. move
down the list, but I don't foresee that," said Larry Fisher,
executive director of Transportation California, which represents the
highway construction industry.</TE>
<TE>   But Los Angeles is not alone in suffering from worsening traffic:
Traffic delays increased in every major urban center in the country
between 1999 and 2000, according to the study.</TE>
<TE>   Even smaller cities--such as Austin, Texas; Charlotte, N.C., and
Albuquerque, N.M.--were said to be facing big-city traffic
congestion.</TE>
<TE>   Six California urban areas--San Francisco/Oakland, San Jose, San
Diego, San Bernardino/Riverside and Sacramento, in addition to
L.A.--ranked among the 25 most congested regions.</TE>
<TE>   The study attributed the increased congestion primarily to a
strong economy, which leads more people to drive to work, shop,
travel and spend. But in addition, in California and most of the rest
of the country, new roadway construction has failed to keep up with
increased demand.</TE>
<TE>   The freeway construction industry responded to the study by
calling on state and federal agencies to spend more on roadway
construction. "It is clear that we are not providing the level of
public investment necessary to maintain the existing highway, bridge
and transit system, much less invest in needed new capacity," said
Pete Ruane, president of the American Road &amp; Transportation Builders
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Other transportation experts say adding more pavement is only a
temporary solution.</TE>
<TE>   James Corless, California director of the Surface Transportation
Policy Project, said California should attack traffic congestion by
trying to reverse the growth patterns that promote the development of
affordable housing in suburbs, miles from job centers.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, the methodology of the Texas Transportation
Institute's annual study has come under some criticism.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington Department of Transportation withheld its financial
support for the study this year, saying the traffic congestion
estimates do not reflect real-life conditions.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the agency said the study relies too much on a
mathematical calculation that are based on the number of cars that a
certain length of roadway can accommodate.</TE>
<TE>   A DOT spokeswoman in Washington, Linda Mullen, said the study's
calculations do not take into consideration congestion relief efforts
such as freeway ramp meters, tow-truck patrol programs and traffic
monitoring efforts that use freeway cameras. Such efforts, she said,
help move the same number of cars more quickly through the same
stretch of road.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Morales, director of the California Department of
Transportation, raised the same concerns and said his agency is also
considering withdrawing its financial support.</TE>
<TE>   He pointed out that Gov. Gray Davis recently approved the largest
transportation spending plan in state history. The budget includes
many freeway improvement projects that will not be included in the
traffic congestion calculations, Morales said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not as accurate a snapshot as it should be," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Lomax, a researcher with the Texas Transportation Institute,
agreed that the study cannot calculate the positive effects of such
efforts, but he said he hoped that would change in the near future.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he said, such a fix in the study might change a few of the
statistics but would probably not end Los Angeles' reign as the city
with the nation's worst traffic.</TE>

<HD>Oxnard Sued Over Dune Housing Plans</HD>
<DH>Environment: Fearing a bad precedent, groups take action
against a project that would allow destruction of wetlands.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three environmental groups are suing Oxnard and the California
Coastal Commission for authorizing the destruction of dunes and a
wetlands area to allow construction of a housing development.</LD>
<LD>   The California Native Plant Society, the Sierra Club and the
Wetland Action Network filed the lawsuit with hopes of saving a
waterfront area in Oxnard they say is protected under the California
Coastal Act.</LD>
<LD>   "The Coastal Act has policies that are very strong to protect
wetlands and sensitive habitat areas. Basically, the commission
determined that those policies wouldn't apply in this case," said
John Buse, an attorney for the Environmental Defense Center office in
Ventura, which represents the Sierra Club in the suit.</LD>
<TE>   Steve Kaufmann, a lawyer for the North Shore at Mandalay Bay
housing project, said the developer has agreed to create a much
larger wetlands area up the coast from the development and form an
increased number of new dunes in the same spot where the old ones
would be excavated.</TE>
<TE>   The site is across the street from the ocean, along a canal at 5th
Street and Harbor Boulevard. The soil at the site is contaminated by
nearly 30 years of dumping oil-field wastes.</TE>
<TE>   The relocation of the wetlands and the excavation of dunes are
necessary to remove any threat of contamination to ground water and
to properly clean up the site for construction, Kaufmann said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is sad and disappointing because it puts environmental
activism on its head," Kaufmann said of the lawsuit, filed last week
in Ventura County Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides generally agree the site is contaminated and the
wetlands are not pristine, but environmentalists worry the decision
to allow the destruction of such a habitat sets a bad precedent.</TE>
<TE>   "The Coastal Commission and Oxnard have given developers
throughout the state the green light to destroy wetlands," Alan
Sanders, a Sierra Club spokesman, said in a prepared statement. "This
decision must not stand."</TE>
<TE>   But Kaufmann challenged that claim, saying coastal commissioners
have authorized the destruction of degraded wetland areas in the
interest of improving water quality in at least two other instances.</TE>
<TE>   He cited a freeway project in San Diego and a case involving a
barn in the Eureka area in Northern California, where cow manure was
being stored to protect a nearby water supply.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists, though, remain concerned and want to preserve
the Oxnard site because it is one of Southern California's last
remaining coastal dune habitats, Buse said.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups fighting the project also believe the
development could affect adjacent coastal resources in the area,
including the snowy plover nesting habitat at Mandalay State Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit is the latest in a long line of hurdles for the
project, which has been in the works for more than a decade. The
plan, scaled down over time, calls for 300 single-family homes along
90 acres of ocean-view property.</TE>
<TE>   The first setback occurred when the oil pollution was found; then
environmentalists filed a lawsuit because of the presence of several
hundred endangered milk vetch plants.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Signal Is Turning Green as Sharon Weighs a Blow
Against Syria</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFFREY ARONSON</AU>
<BD>Geoffrey Aronson is director of the Foundation for
Middle East Peace.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While public attention in the United States and elsewhere is riveted
to the latest maneuvers in the stalemated Israeli-Palestinian
conflict, something far more significant may be brewing on Israel's
northern frontier. For the first time since then-Defense Minister
Ariel Sharon, under a benevolent American eye, led Israel's
star-crossed invasion of Lebanon in 1982, there are growing
indications that a U.S. president has given Israel a green light to
attack targets on Syrian soil if the on-again-off-again battle
between Israel and Hezbollah intensifies.</LD>
<LD>   A U.S. prohibition on Israel attacking Syria has been in effect
for decades; it has helped to prevent a regional war. This
restriction also, however, has emboldened Syrians confident that
Washington would restrain the occasional Israeli impulse to "go to
the source" of its problems with Lebanese groups, most notably
Hezbollah, by attacking their patron, Syria.</LD>
<TE>   A combination of circumstances appears to have put U.S. policy on
a more aggressive course: the growing view of Syria as a junior
member of the axis of evil and backer of Iraqi and Palestinian
terrorism; the increasing identification of Israel's "Arab problems"
in the Palestinian territories and elsewhere with problems
encountered by the U.S.;  the growing arsenal of Hezbollah weaponry
supplied by Syria and Iran; and an Israeli government more likely
than its predecessors to entertain a direct attack on Syria.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Sharon's government did, indeed, contemplate such a
strike this year. According to Eyal Zisser, an Israeli analyst,
hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah failed to trigger war in
April not because of American opposition but because Sharon has
learned that precipitous military action without a broad public
consensus is a recipe for defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon has President Bush's goodwill in his pocket, and in his
conversations in Washington this month he found himself in the
unusual position of preaching the virtues of caution and patience to
some in the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon is confident that a confrontation with Hezbollah and
Syria--under the inexperienced President Bashar Assad, who seems to
be unable or unwilling to rein in proponents of a more militant
line--is only a matter of time.</TE>
<TE>   Does it make sense for the Bush administration to support such a
policy?</TE>
<TE>   Syria is an inviting target. It is on Washington's short list of
countries that most egregiously support terror and field chemical
weapons. Hitting Syria would be portrayed by Bush partisans as
striking a blow against terror. It might also be condoned as the
first campaign of the preemptive military action endorsed by Bush in
his June 1 speech.</TE>
<TE>   There are even some who argue that ending Syria's immunity from
the long arm of the Israeli military would help Assad wrest control
of his government from hard-liners who dominate the ruling Baath
Party. Such an attack could give Assad just the kick he needs to
embark upon a genuine rapprochement with Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Escalation of this sort, however, is risky business. Sharon revels
in such a throw of the dice, but the U.S. needs to remember that
Sharon has proved to be more adept at getting into trouble--not only
for Israel but also for the U.S.--than out of it.</TE>

<AU>DAVID MARTIN</AU>
<BD>David Martin is an Ottawa attorney and contributor to
"101 Damnations: The Humorists' Tour of Personal Hells" (St. Martin's
Press), due in August.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The White House today released a copy of a letter from President Bush
to Joseph Blatter, president of the international soccer association
charged with organizing the World Cup:</LD>
<LD>   Dear Joe: As you know, I'm not a big soccer fan. Like most of my
fellow Americans, I don't know an offsides from a corner kick.</LD>
<LD>   But I do know one thing: People in this country don't care for
soccer. It's not that they don't want to like it. It's just that it's
so darn boring and confusing.</LD>
<TE>   I think it would be a great step toward world peace and
international understanding if all the world's nations could compete
in one sport together. I understand you've already got a lot of
nations onside with this soccer thing. Here are some friendly
suggestions to help sign up the rest:</TE>
<TE>   * Stop calling it football. It's not football, for Pete's sake.</TE>
<TE>   Football is the Giants versus the Redskins, the Cowboys versus the
49ers, Notre Dame versus Ohio State. Your game is soccer. S-O-K-E-R.
Got it?</TE>
<TE>   * Please put more lines on the field so we know where the players
are. How about some horizontal, parallel lines every five yards or so
to let us know where the action is?</TE>
<TE>   * Give the players some helmets and padding. Boy, it's hard to
watch a guy hit the ball with his uncovered head, or collapse in pain
when someone bumps him, and not think this is a cruel and dangerous
sport. I assure you that protective equipment will make everybody
safer.</TE>
<TE>   * Let one team have the ball for more than 10 seconds. Why not
give each team four tries to make 10 yards, say? If they do, they get
four more tries. Then you've got some continuity instead of the
current chaos.</TE>
<TE>   * Stop the clock once in a while. The referees have whistles; why
not let them use them? I'm sure the players could use a break, and
I'd sure like a chance to get a snack or use the bathroom. And you
know what, Joe? I bet you'd get a lot more advertisers. You might
even want to consider splitting each half up into two quarters to
provide more ad time.</TE>
<TE>   * Change that offsides rule. Who the heck understands that? I
can't even figure it out in hockey, where they've got a blue line and
everything.</TE>
<TE>   Why not line both teams up and call that the offsides line or,
say, the line of scrimmage?</TE>
<TE>   * I've got one word for you, Joe: cheerleaders. A group of
attractive, athletic young ladies is always entertaining for the
folks in the stands and those watching at home. Let's face it, Joe.
Your game can be a bit of a yawn-fest, and it's always nice to look
at pretty gals.</TE>
<TE>   * Let the players use their hands. Joe, they look like a bunch of
sissies out there with their arms hanging limp. Let 'em catch the
ball and pass the ball. If they have to kick it, why not set up some
goal posts at either end and let them try to kick the ball through
the posts?</TE>
<TE>   * Now this playoff business, or what you folks call the World Cup
tournament. I used to be in the baseball business, and I did OK. But
it wasn't from holding playoffs every four years! You gotta hold them
every year, Joe.</TE>
<TE>   Now, if you folks could implement these minor changes, I'm sure
you'd get Americans coming to your games in droves. At that point, I
doubt any of them would even care if you still called it football.</TE>

<HD>'Better Safe Than Sorry' Carries a High Price Tag</HD>
<DH>Overcautiousness kills in the name of protecting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY I. MILLER</AU>
<BD>Henry I. Miller, a physician, is a fellow at the Hoover
Institution. He was an official at the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration from 1979 to 1994.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It used to be said that the most fearsome statement in the world is,
"I'm from the government and I'm here to help you." Now, government
officials have the "precautionary principle," which supposedly will
make our lives safer. In fact, the principle--which is not one at all
but a seemingly plausible excuse for opposing innovation--has already
laid waste to several industries and boasts a body count in the
millions.</LD>
<LD>   The Environmental Protection Agency has just provided another
egregious example: a crackdown on the most reliable kind of blood
pressure cuffs--which I and other doctors consider to be the standard
for accuracy--in order to cut down on the use of mercury, which can
pollute the air and water if disposed of carelessly.</LD>
<LD>   The basic idea of the precautionary principle, which the EPA and
other regulatory agencies often employ senselessly, is that even if
there is no scientific evidence of actual dangers of a product,
technology or activity, merely conjectural concerns should be a
reason to limit or prohibit it.</LD>
<TE>   For example, although used for decades, I have never heard of a
mercury spill from a broken blood pressure cuff. In any event mercury
toxicity under these conditions would be modest. The EPA's action is
ill-considered, myopic and dangerous: Inaccurate blood pressure
measurements can lead to under- or over-medication of a person with a
life-threatening disease.</TE>
<TE>   The precautionary principle is sometimes represented as being like
Mom's admonition, "Better safe than sorry," or to reflect regulators'
remonstrations that they're just "erring on the side of safety." But
the way the precautionary principle is typically applied can actually
increase risk.</TE>
<TE>   The concept focuses on the possibility that technologies could
pose unique or unmanageable risks, even after considerable testing
has already been conducted.</TE>
<TE>   Missing from precautionary calculus is an acknowledgment that even
when technologies introduce risks, most confer net benefits--that is,
their use reduces many other, more serious hazards.</TE>
<TE>   The danger in the precautionary principle is that it distracts
from known threats to health. For example, in 18th century Europe,
excessive precautionary bias delayed for decades the introduction of
the first smallpox vaccine, with millions dying unnecessarily.</TE>
<TE>   And 30 years ago, on the basis only of suspicion of toxicity to
fish and migrating birds (but no evidence of harm to humans), the EPA
drastically restricted production and use of DDT, an inexpensive and
stunningly effective pesticide once widely used to kill mosquitoes
and other disease-carrying insects. With the ensuing reduction of
global DDT use, the World Health Organization estimates that 300
million to 500 million cases of malaria occur annually and more than
1 million people die.</TE>
<TE>   Another horrendous example of the precautionary principle in
action occurred in the late 1980s, when environmental activists,
claiming that carcinogenic byproducts from the chlorination of
drinking water posed a potential cancer risk, persuaded Peruvian
officials to stop chlorinating much of their country's drinking
water. That decision contributed to the acceleration and spread of
Latin America's 1991-96 cholera epidemic, which afflicted more than
1.3 million people.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-chlorine campaigners recently have turned their attacks to
certain plastics used for important medical devices, particularly
fluid containers, blood bags, tubing and gloves; children's toys such
as teething rings; and household and industrial items including
flooring. Invoking the precautionary principle, activists claim that
these plastics might have numerous adverse health effects--even in
the face of significant scientific evidence to the contrary.</TE>
<TE>   Whole industries have been terrorized, consumers denied product
choices, and doctors and their patients deprived of lifesaving tools.
The precautionary principle inflates the cost of research, inhibits
new product development, wastes resources, restricts consumer choice,
creates serious new risks and costs lives.</TE>
<TE>   Just thinking about it raises my blood pressure.</TE>

<HD>Swiss-Cheese Approach to Death Penalty</HD>
<DH>IQ ruling boosts the argument for ending executions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN TURLEY</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Turley is a law professor at George Washington
University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Thursday, Virginia prisoner Daryl Renard Atkins achieved that
status reserved for a few people with uncommon diseases and
unprecedented Supreme Court cases: He became a term unto himself,
like Graves' disease and Miranda rights.</LD>
<LD>   Reversing a 13-year-old case, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in
Atkins vs. Virginia that it was unconstitutional to execute a
"mentally retarded" person. This case promises to complicate further
a death penalty system already riddled with controversies and
contradictions.</LD>
<LD>   Under the new Atkins standard, states will have to show that a
defendant is not mentally retarded--a standard that includes low
intelligence--before they impose the death penalty. The court noted
that defendants may be able to know the difference between right and
wrong and be competent to stand trial but still be legally retarded
for the purposes of the death penalty. It is their "limitations on
adaptive skills" that make them ineligible for the death penalty.</LD>
<TE>   Jurors will now not only have to look into the heart of an
individual to determine intent but also look into his head to
determine intellect. This standard creates tension with other
standards in death penalty cases, such as the M'Naghten insanity
test. A person can be exempt from execution under Atkins despite the
fact that he or she is capable of distinguishing right and wrong.
However, Andrea Yates, for example, is subject to execution under
M'Naghten because a jury found that she was capable of distinguishing
right and wrong in drowning her five children.</TE>
<TE>   The determination of an individual's intellect remains an
uncertain science. Under the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales
Test--the standard IQ test--a score of 100 is considered average
intellectual ability. A person scoring below 70 is considered
mentally retarded and presumably would be exempt from the death
penalty. Atkins registered a 59 IQ.</TE>
<TE>   At first blush, a cutoff of 70 does not seem particularly high.
Studies indicate that no more than 3% of the population falls below
this level. However, the percentage of such defendants in murder
cases is likely to be much higher than the population at large.</TE>
<TE>   The practical problem is not the actual number of low-intellect
defendants but the number of self-professed low-intellect defendants.
After Atkins, there will be a line of prisoners appearing in federal
court to prove that they have room-temperature IQs. Because mandatory
IQ testing was stopped in most states in the 1970s, an individual's
IQ will be measured only after he is arrested and facing potential
capital punishment. The Wechsler test will now become a prisoner's
version of the SAT for entrance into a class of
death-penalty-exempted defendants. This is an occasion where you do
not want to strive for membership in Mensa.</TE>
<TE>   The Atkins decision will further reduce the death penalty to a
process of elimination. In a prior ruling, the court barred the
execution of minors. The court has also barred the use of the death
penalty in certain types of garden-variety murder. States must find
that the person was consciously and materially more depraved than the
average murderer.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, a number of heinous murderers have been able to
negotiate themselves out of the death penalty by fleeing the country.
Ira Einhorn killed his girlfriend and then lived with her body
stuffed in a locker for months. He remained a fugitive for more than
two decades until he was located in France.</TE>
<TE>   Like most of the world, France does not approve of the death
penalty and will not extradite in such cases. Thus, the state
prosecutors promised that Einhorn would not face the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, James Charles Kopp, accused of killing a doctor in New
York who performed abortions, was able to secure the same guarantee
after his capture in France.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with these exemptions, prosecutors will now look for the
Grade A, death-qualified prisoner. The ideal will be the "Ted Bundy
Class" of executable prisoners: someone smart enough, old enough and
not living in France.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is not with the principle behind Atkins but with the
increasing difficulty in guaranteeing a consistent and coherent death
penalty system.</TE>
<TE>   We need to consider the logic behind continuing the imposition of
the death penalty under these conditions. Given the increasing
exemptions, the continued use of the death penalty raises questions
about our own system's "limitations in adaptive skills."</TE>
<TE>   Justice can be served with sentences of mandatory life without
parole. It will not be served by a legal system of musical chairs
where the last one standing without an exemption is executed.</TE>

<HD>Bush's Left Coast Lesson</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration has freely snubbed California on
environmental issues, apparently still smarting from President Bush's
big loss here to Al Gore and figuring he can get reelected without
the state. Now, GOP gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr. and others
must have reminded the president that the state Republican Party was
all but destroyed when his father wrote off California as unwinnable
in his 1992 reelection campaign. The California GOP is still trying
to recover. But the president has seen some light.</LD>
<LD>   On June 6, the administration gave the back of its hand to
California's suggestion that if offshore oil drilling was bad for
Florida, it was bad for California too. Referring to Bush's decision
to prevent oil drilling off the Florida coast, Secretary of the
Interior Gale A. Norton made the confounding comment that "Florida
opposes coastal drilling and California does not." Swat. Swat. Take
that, California.</LD>
<LD>   But two short weeks later, Bush and Norton indicated they were
willing to discuss something that even most environmental groups
thought impossible--getting rid of oil rigs off the California coast.</LD>
<TE>   Why the turnabout? It was a visit to Bush by Simon. The wealthy
conservative is attempting to position himself as even friendlier to
the coastal environment than Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, a longtime
foe of new drilling in coastal waters. Simon goes further, proposing
to halt existing production and dismantle the rigs. Emerging from the
White House Wednesday, Simon said the Bush administration was
"willing to sit down and talk about these issues."</TE>
<TE>   This may all be politics, but we'll take it. Anything that
prevents any new drilling off the coast is welcome. That anyone could
stop existing production is harder to believe. It would no doubt cost
billions of dollars to buy the oil companies' rigs, even if they were
willing to sell. And the Bush administration would have to square
that with a zealous energy policy built on extracting oil wherever it
can be found, even in the pristine Alaskan Arctic. But let the talks
begin.</TE>
<TE>   The first item on the agenda should be to ban drilling on 36
existing leases off the Central California coast. The next item: The
Bush administration should drop its appeal of a federal court ruling
that gives the state virtual veto authority over new oil activity in
federal waters off the California coast--anything beyond three miles
out. California filed the suit to test a state's right to protect its
coastline and water and air quality under the federal Coastal Zone
Management Act. By appealing, the Bush administration is trying to
deny California that authority.</TE>
<TE>   It's evident that someone, perhaps Simon, has convinced Bush how
important a political issue the coastal environment is in California,
to Republicans and Democrats. The old dictum still stands: Good
policy makes good politics.</TE>

<LD>Standing guard at a county hospital or welfare office is generally
not as dangerous or stressful as wrestling armed felons in alleys at
midnight. So Los Angeles County should pay the cops who perform those
security functions less than it pays the sheriff's deputies who
patrol the streets.</LD>
<LD>   The county police won big this month when Superior Court Judge
Victor Chavez ordered the county to raise their salaries to the level
of sheriff's deputies, as well as reimburse them $100 million for
seven years of back pay and retroactively pension increases.</LD>
<LD>   The court order followed a jury's decision this month that these
officers were underpaid because of racial discrimination--80% of the
approximately 500 officers are Latino or African American. The
Sheriff's Department remains mostly white.</LD>
<TE>   We're glad that county attorneys plan to contest these decisions.
Though the two types of officers have similar qualifications--both
are sworn peace officers and armed--their missions and risk levels
are different. County cops sometimes confront street gangs, violent
psychiatric patients or doped-up street thugs, but they generally
patrol a controlled environment equipped with metal detectors.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, county police applicants have the opportunity to take the
more lucrative career path by applying instead to the Sheriff's
Department. One reason many don't is that they choose to avoid the
daunting jail duty most deputies must endure. Until someone shows
that the department is still hostile to black and Latino
candidates--as it was in the past--the salary issue seems elective.</TE>
<TE>   County cops earn 30% to 40% less than sheriff's deputies. Before
they grasp for deputies' higher salaries, county police officers
should recognize that there are those who think they should be
replaced by private armed security guards, who as a rule make less.</TE>
<TE>   In these times of terrorism, when public facilities need
professional protection, we wouldn't want the county cops job
privatized. In fact, we'd encourage the California Legislature to
change state pension law to provide police benefits to the families
of any county police officer killed in the line of duty. But the
terrorist threat has made already-tight government budgets even more
so.</TE>
<TE>   The county cannot pay these officers $100 million this year, given
its obligations to other vital services, such as the hospitals, that
county police are paid to protect. This decision should be
overturned.</TE>

<HD>An Essential Water Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Enterprising farmers began drawing water from the Colorado River in
1901 to transform the Imperial Valley desert east of San Diego into a
lush agricultural empire. Today, the Imperial Irrigation District
sucks as much as 3.2 million acre-feet a year from the river to
irrigate 450,000 acres of cropland--nearly six times the amount of
water the city of Los Angeles uses in a year.</LD>
<LD>   Why do crops come before people even as California's growing
population strains the state's water supply? It's not because growing
crops in the desert makes more sense. It's because state water law
gives preference to those who got to the water first. About 80% of
the water consumed statewide goes to agriculture and 20% to industry,
homes and everything else. It's long been obvious that the additional
water needed to accommodate cities ultimately would come from farms.
That time is now and the battleground is the Imperial Irrigation
District.</LD>
<LD>   Southern California has met demand by drawing far more water from
the Colorado than it is legally entitled to--water belonging to
Arizona, Nevada and other Colorado Basin states. Now those states are
growing too and have demanded their full shares.</LD>
<TE>   The Imperial Irrigation District drew attention decades ago
because it was losing huge amounts of water through leaky canals and
wasteful irrigation practices. The district struck a pioneering deal
with urban Southern California's big water wholesaler, the
Metropolitan Water District, in the mid-1980s. Metropolitan financed
conservation facilities for Imperial and in return took the water it
saved.</TE>
<TE>   A far larger, 75-year agreement was reached by Imperial and the
San Diego County Water Agency in the late 1990s to transfer enough
water to San Diego to supply the household needs of 400,000 families.
The deal is essential to offsetting the loss of Colorado River water.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis, federal officials and leaders of the other big
Southern California water districts now say Imperial should take
enough land out of production to provide the needed water. This has
touched off anger and anguish in the Imperial Valley, which has long
feared a big-city water grab similar to Los Angeles' raid of Owens
Valley water early in the 20th century. The farmers would be paid
well for fallowing the land, but the ripple effect would hurt farm
workers and businesses that live off crop production. Imperial water
agency leaders are threatening to back out of the San Diego
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   If the sale of farm water to San Diego falls through, the Colorado
River cuts will have to come from somewhere else. The federal
government says it will slash coastal Southern California's Colorado
River supply, which would trigger water rationing and shrivel the
economy.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, the Bush administration and others must find a way to make
the Imperial-San Diego trade work. If that includes easing the
economic impact on the farm region overall, Imperial will be
reassured that any future water trades won't be Owens Valley-style
grabs.</TE>

<HD>Judge Throws Out Murder Verdict Against Knoller</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Mauling Murder Count Voided," June 18: All of us who have served
on juries are offended by Judge James Warren's ruling--after the jury
deliberated--that a second-degree murder conviction of Marjorie
Knoller in the atrocious killing of an innocent woman by viciously
trained dogs was inappropriate. The judge could have eliminated
second-degree murder as a possibility before the jury deliberated.
But he did not. He let the jurors waste their time, which the judge
obviously values at zero. All of us who have to serve time in the
Superior Court jury waiting rooms know that the judges consider us
less than human--and treat us accordingly.</LD>
<LD>   We live not in a democracy but in a "juristocracy." The courts and
the judges rule. It does not matter who votes in a law--or a
referendum--if a judge disagrees, the issue is dead. Voters have no
control over the judiciary branch of government, which is seizing
power.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Re "Say No to Jury-Dodging," editorial, June 18, and the
dog-mauling verdict: How does a judge find such an obvious preference
for lawyers in this case? Testimony clearly showed that the dogs were
trained to go for the jugular. If trained to do that, that alone
would indicate to any thinking person that their intent is to
kill--in this case murder. Who wants to spend two weeks in jury
service and have a judge set aside the verdict?</TE>
<TE>   P.S. I have spent two weeks on a jury listening to volumes of
technical medical terminology and seeing evidentiary exhibits,
graphs, illustrative videos and other visuals in a malpractice suit.
We spent two or three days in reaching a verdict. If after all that
time and effort our verdict had been set aside, I would find a reason
to not serve on a jury again.</TE>
<TE>   Katherine Gerstenberger</TE>
<TE>   Ventura</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The American Heritage Dictionary and California law defines murder
as the intentional killing of another with malice aforethought. There
is no evidence that Marjorie Knoller intended to kill Diane Whipple
by deliberately unleashing her dog for that purpose. Criminally
irresponsible? Yes!</TE>
<TE>   Knoller is also guilty of being repugnant and arrogant, but that
should not influence the decision. It is not the duty of either a
judge or jury to assume the role of "thought police," and to do so
sets a dangerous precedent. The case deserves to be revisited, with a
judge providing better legal instructions to the jury.</TE>

<LD>Re "Even Tougher Love for Welfare Moms," Commentary, June 11: Bruce
Fuller criticizes the requirement for welfare recipients to work 40
hours per week. In fact, the administration's welfare proposal
requires only that recipients be engaged in actual work for 24 hours
per week. The other 16 hours would have to be spent in activities
that could include training in job readiness and job skills,
substance abuse treatment (for which states receive no credit under
current law) and counseling--whatever is necessary to complement
recipients' work efforts and help them succeed.</LD>
<LD>   The expected 40 hours of combined work and complementary
activities are essential to help recipients prepare for taking the
kinds of jobs offering the best wages and crucial benefits, like
health and child care. We expect states to use the flexibility
inherent in the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program to
assure that recipients are working toward this goal.</LD>
<LD>   We have no intention of neglecting the children; in fact, the
administration has proposed that improving child well-being should be
the overarching goal of the TANF program. The administration proposes
to maintain spending on child care at historically high
levels--overall, $11 billion per year in federal and state funds. The
president's proposal would also strengthen child support enforcement.</LD>

<LD>The process of security at our nation's airports is a joke and an
outrage. The random selection and search of individuals prior to
boarding a plane is making fools out of those who make the rules. On
a recent trip from L.A. to Dallas and back I was appalled that two
young Boy Scouts were being searched at the gate while I walked onto
the plane with a glass bottle of iced tea. The bottle was in the same
hand as my boarding pass and ID as I was checked out for the third
time for that flight.</LD>
<LD>   Don't get me wrong. The checking of IDs before boarding is a good
idea. It should help get the right people to the right places, but
even that program works only fair at best. Not long ago I was en
route from St. Louis to L.A. via Denver. While the plane was getting
ready for takeoff in Denver, the passenger sitting next to me
realized that he was on the wrong plane. He was ticketed to be on a
plane to Orlando, not L.A.</LD>
<LD>   It's a waste to have the people who do the random searches at the
gate employed at my and other travelers' expense.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Cast a Steady Eye on Peace" (editorial, June 20) states how crucial
it is for there to be a Palestinian state in order to end suicide
bombings. How unrealistic can you be? I have to admit, two years ago
I was a promoter of peace between the Israelis and Palestinians. But
now I see it is no longer an option.</LD>
<LD>   The so-called Palestinians don't want peace, they want to drive
Israel into the sea. Creating a state for them would not only
legitimate their horrific terror attacks, it would give them more
ability to regroup and create more terror.</LD>
<LD>   The Islamic militants who perform these suicide acts are not
interested in peace, and we all know Yasser Arafat isn't either.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Build Palestinian Hope, Build Israeli Confidence," Commentary,
June 19: Dennis Ross doesn't take into consideration the Palestinian
perspective at all. Having a state does not necessarily mean "freedom
from Israeli control." Ehud Barak's offer at Camp David was a
Palestinian state totally under the control of Israel, which is why
Arafat rejected it.</TE>
<TE>   Ross talks about performance on both sides, but there are no
demands on Israel, and worse, no sanctions. On the contrary, since
Israel doesn't want a Palestinian state, it will do everything it can
to make sure a timeline fails. Any agreement that does not require
Israel to relinquish control of the Palestinians upfront (i.e., by
freezing settlements, dismantling them and stopping the siege of
Palestinians) isn't going to work. And there must be built-in
sanctions for the Israelis, like the elder President Bush's
deductions from U.S. aid for dollars spent on settlements.</TE>

<TE>   Ross provided an excellent road map to peace. In essence, though,
his plan, like so many before it, will succeed or fail on whether the
Palestinians recognize the futility in terrorist acts of blowing up
women and children. Ross should, therefore, add to his plan the use
of those Christian evangelists described in "Hold the Fire and
Brimstone" (June 19). These preachers could preach to the
Palestinians that what is most important in God's eyes is not the
afterlife (virgins versus hell) but life itself.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bush needs to insist Israel remove its 200,000 illegal settlers
from the Palestinian West Bank and 5,000 from Gaza. Israel must trade
land for peace. Unless Bush stops our one-sided support for Israel
(Arabs see U.S. gunships and tanks blowing up Palestinians every
night on their TV news), we will get more Arab terrorist attacks on
the U.S. If he watched Arab TV news each night, the president would
see for himself why they hate us. The terror on both sides must stop.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Scott Ritter raises some interesting questions in his June 19
commentary, "Behind 'Plot' on Hussein, a Secret Agenda," but he
doesn't go far enough. So far, the Bush administration has failed to
make a case for why we should attack Iraq. Is it because Saddam
Hussein possesses weapons of mass destruction? There is no solid
proof yet presented to the American people. And even if Iraq does
possess such weapons, is that reason enough to attack?</LD>
<LD>   Other countries, notably China, Russia, Pakistan and India, also
have weapons of mass destruction. Yet we never hear anything from
President Bush about attacking them.</LD>
<LD>   And even if Hussein is shown to have such weapons, what proof do
we have that he intends to use them against the U.S.?</LD>
<TE>   It seems to me that those questions must be answered long before
we even contemplate attacking Iraq and risking American lives.</TE>

<LD>Re "Hold the Fire and Brimstone," June 19:</LD>
<LD>   The medieval life on Earth was hell. Life was short. Disease,
injury, starvation and terror were ubiquitous. Religious precepts
ruled. Faith was the order of the day.</LD>
<LD>   St. Thomas Aquinas rediscovered Aristotle. In the founding of the
United States, faith receded and reason blossomed. Life in America,
ruled by the absolute of reality identified by reason, became long,
healthy, prosperous and happy--the goal of men across the world.</LD>
<TE>   Faith propagators are on the march, demanding a rejection of
reason and a return to faith. Choose today: faith and hell or reason
and happiness.</TE>

<TE>   To hell with hell! In this country our government can make rapid
decisions to spend trillions on weapons designed to kill the living,
but single-payer universal health care, clean-air measures,
affordable housing and food for all are too expensive. Our government
drags its heels on these measures, which would save the living, and
there is no national outrage. This is the area of true failure in all
faith groups.</TE>

<LD>Re "J.C. Brown, 67; Led National Gallery of Art," obituary, June 19:</LD>
<LD>   I found it sadly ironic that the death of J. Carter Brown, former
director of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, coincides with
the demise of the grand vista between the Lincoln and Washington
monuments.</LD>
<LD>   In spite of his excellent record as director of our National
Gallery, the Brown-led U.S. Fine Arts Commission seemed incapable of
defending the National Mall against the rudely placed World War II
Memorial. His legacy will suffer as a result, along with the magical
grand vista that died with him.</LD>

<HD>New TV Ads Heat Up Governor's Race</HD>
<DH>Campaign: Davis and Simon unleash attacks, which both camps
accuse of being misleading. One analyst predicts a 'long, ugly
summer.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The two men vying for the governor's office stepped up their attacks
on one another Thursday, with Republican Bill Simon Jr. launching a
television broadside against Democratic Gov. Gray Davis and the
governor responding with his second commercial questioning his
rival's management skills.</LD>
<LD>   The back-and-forth moved the governor's race into what analysts
say will be a summer of sharp-edged competition over the airwaves
between Davis, whose popularity has dropped in recent years, and the
little-known Simon, a businessman making his first bid for political
office.</LD>
<LD>   "In the case of Davis, he needs to maintain momentum, and in the
case of Simon, he needs to create momentum," said Larry N. Gerston,
professor of political science at San Jose State.</LD>
<TE>   "The result is that you will see this ... all the way until
election day."</TE>
<TE>   Added GOP consultant Mike Madrid: "It's going to be long, hot,
ugly summer."</TE>
<TE>   The governor set the tone last week when he began airing a
television commercial criticizing Simon's service as a board member
of a failed savings and loan.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Simon responded with two 30-second ads that accuse
Davis of ignoring the state's budget deficit and its troubled schools
to make "false personal attacks."</TE>
<TE>   "Gray Davis seems more concerned with his own political future
than our state's future," said Simon in one of the ads, speaking in a
wood-paneled library.</TE>
<TE>   The commercials, which the campaign said are running statewide,
also accuse the governor of refusing to debate Simon.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis campaign said that it has heard nothing from the Simon
campaign about debates.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor will debate him anywhere, anytime," campaign
spokesman Roger Salazar said. "If I were Bill Simon, I would be a
little bit leery of that, because before you want to debate, you
probably want to have some issues you want to talk about."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the two ads that began airing Thursday, Simon will
begin airing a third ad on Monday that plays off the governor's
reputation as a prolific fund-raiser.</TE>
<TE>   The commercial accuses the governor of spending "up to 12 hours a
day fund-raising" and ignoring state business. In it, an alarm clock
rings as a narrator intones, "Tell Gray Davis his time is up."</TE>
<TE>   Salazar called the ad "untrue," and said that Davis leaves
fund-raising up to professionals on his campaign team.</TE>
<TE>   Davis began running a second commercial Thursday that questions
Simon's business dealings. The ad cites financial losses and
investigations into four companies Simon has been involved with. "If
he can't run a business, how can he run the fifth-largest economy in
the world?" a narrator asks.</TE>
<TE>   Aides to Simon called the ad misleading, saying that Simon is not
responsible for the management of companies in which he was merely an
investor.</TE>
<TE>   "This ad is a rather sad and pathetic attempt by Gray Davis to
deflect attention from his failed leadership and gross mismanagement
of the state," Simon said in a statement released Thursday evening.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican candidate's new television commercials followed
public expressions of concern from some GOP activists that Simon's
campaign was being damaged by his refusal to respond to Davis'
charges over the air. Earlier this week, Simon began airing an ad on
Spanish-language television, but it focused on education instead of
Davis' charges.</TE>
<TE>   Some speculated that the rookie candidate was reluctant to spend
money on expensive television advertising with more than five months
to go before the November election.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who has raised more than $35 million, can more easily
absorb the cost.</TE>
<TE>   Simon strategist Sal Russo said the campaign's fund-raising has
exceeded his expectations and that the campaign has "several million
dollars" on hand.</TE>

<HD>Morris Berman, 92; Tittle Photo Endures</HD>

<LD>Morris Berman, the Pittsburgh newspaper photographer whose photo of
bloodied New York Giants quarterback Y.A. Tittle became one of the
most enduring images in sports, has died. He was 92.</LD>
<LD>   Berman died Sunday in Sun City, Ariz., of congestive heart
failure.</LD>
<LD>   A newspaper photographer in Pittsburgh for more than 40 years,
Berman always maintained that his photo of Tittle would have won a
Pulitzer Prize--if his newspaper had only printed it.</LD>
<TE>   Berman was working for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in 1964 when he
was assigned to cover an early season NFL game between the Pittsburgh
Steelers and the visiting Giants.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with the Phoenix New Times last year, Berman said
he decided to focus on one player as the game went along and that
player was Tittle.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought if I followed somebody at the heart of things, I might
be able to get something," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In a series of photographs, Berman recorded Steeler defensive end
John Baker breaking through the line and pounding Tittle to the turf
as the quarterback tried to throw. The pass, intended for running
back Frank Gifford, was intercepted by the Steelers and returned for
a touchdown. Tittle, then 37, was badly shaken on the play and
suffered bruised ribs. He sat out the second half of the game, which
the Steelers won 27-24.</TE>
<TE>   Tittle retired at the end of that season.</TE>
<TE>   While other photographers recorded Baker's hit and Tittle as he
was later helped to his feet by teammates, Berman was apparently the
only one to capture Tittle alone, battered and bleeding and sitting
back on his knees.</TE>
<TE>   Berman took the film back the paper and showed his photo editor,
who declined to run it the next day because, he said, there was no
action in the photograph. He did, however, run several other Berman
photographs of the game. All were standard fare.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his photo editor's negative response, Berman liked the
Tittle photograph and began entering it in professional competitions.
Others liked it too; it won several awards, including a National
Headliner prize as the best sports photograph of 1964.</TE>
<TE>   It has been included in collections of the best sports photographs
of the 20th century and now hangs in the National Football Hall of
Fame in Canton, Ohio. It was also part of an HBO documentary on
sports photography last January called "Picture Perfect: The Stories
Behind the Greatest Photographs in Sports," produced by Neil Leifer
and Joe Lavine.</TE>
<TE>   The picture was not only an aesthetic success--capturing Tittle's
failed last stand in the brutal world of pro football--but also
helped change the way photographers looked at sports. While action
shots were still a staple in newspapers and sports magazines, more
subtle images that went beyond the action genre started to emerge.</TE>
<TE>   "It said to a lot of people that sometimes the most revealing
sports photograph was made after the play was done or the game was
over. It capitalized on the value of its emotion," said Rich
Clarkson, former director of photography at National Geographic, who
now has his own sports photography agency in Denver.</TE>
<TE>   "It led other photographers to open their eyes to things other
than peak action," Clarkson said.</TE>
<TE>   The son of Jewish immigrants from Bucharest, Berman grew up in
Wheeling, W.Va. He began his newspaper career at the Wheeling News as
a reporter but became interested in photography and started taking
pictures to go with his stories.</TE>
<TE>   After moving to Pittsburgh, he joined the staff of the now-defunct
Sun-Telegraph.</TE>
<TE>   His introduction to news photography in Pittsburgh came when he
was given a Speed Graphic camera and assigned to cover a nasty steel
strike in Beaver Falls, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   Berman came back from that assignment with some memorable images
and his days as a reporter were over.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, Berman served as an Army photographer in
North Africa and Italy. One of his more notable images was that of
the bodies of the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and Mussolini's
mistress, Clara Petacci, after they had been strung up by their heels
by an angry mob in 1945.</TE>
<TE>   Back in Pittsburgh after the war, Berman continued to work for the
Sun-Telegraph until it was bought by the Post-Gazette in 1960.</TE>
<TE>   He stayed with the Post-Gazette until his retirement in 1979. He
then moved to Arizona, where he took freelance assignments and taught
at Arizona State University.</TE>
<TE>   Berman was also a founding member of the National Press
Photographers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   An exhibition containing 80 of his photographs was shown at the
West Valley Art Museum in Sunrise, Ariz., in late 2000 and early
2001. Many of the images were later shown at the Sky Harbor
International Airport in Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Berman is survived by his second wife, Diana, and several nieces
and nephews.</TE>

<LD>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has stepped up its posting
of route maps and schedules at its bus stops and is exploring ways to
equip all 18,000 stops throughout Los Angeles County with better
information displays, officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The MTA initiated the measures after The Times reported in January
that only 2.7% of its bus stops displayed route maps or schedule
information, while 22% of those in San Francisco and more than 85% of
those in New York City do.</LD>

<LD>Five people, including a senior Immigration and Naturalization
Service inspector, were indicted by a federal grand jury Thursday on
charges of conspiring to smuggle illegal immigrants from the
Philippines into the U.S. through LAX.</LD>
<LD>   Maximiano Ramos, 52, a 19-year INS veteran; Eshraga Nugud, 41;
Gloria Acosta, 47; and Vinzon Perez, 57, were arrested last week. A
fifth defendant, Rita Cunanan, 42, is a fugitive.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors said the suspects took advantage of a rule that allows
international passengers en route to a third country to stop briefly
in the U.S. while connecting to other flights.</LD>
<TE>   The illegal immigrants allegedly paid as much as $10,000 each to
be whisked past security.</TE>

<HD>Education Funds Shift Is Rejected</HD>
<DH>Budget: Republicans in Assembly band together to defeat a
key piece of Gov. Davis' plan to close a budget gap. Democrats blame
politics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis' plan to close a $23.6-billion budget shortfall hit a
major snag Thursday when Assembly Republicans blocked his proposal to
free up $1.7 billion in education spending.</LD>
<LD>   The action prompted Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) to adjourn the
Legislature's budget conference committee until the matter is
resolved. Peace had hoped to wrap up negotiations on California's
2002-03 budget by Sunday, but he said that goal seems unlikely to be
met because the Assembly action has left the size of the budget gap
in question.</LD>
<LD>   Davis wants to shift about $1.7 billion in education funding,
primarily from the current fiscal year to the upcoming one, to avoid
suspending Proposition 98, the 1988 ballot measure that dedicates
about 35% of the state general fund to public schools.</LD>
<TE>   Because the shift involves current-year spending it requires the
approval of the Legislature before the end of the fiscal year, on
June 30.</TE>
<TE>   But the proposal, embodied in SB 1830 sponsored by Peace, came up
six votes short in the Assembly, where Republicans banded together to
deny the required two-thirds majority.</TE>
<TE>   They did so after Democrats rejected a GOP request for nearly $1
billion to equalize spending between urban and rural schools,
beginning in 2003-04, and to help school districts meet retirement
benefit requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Republican opposition to the $1.7-billion budget shift proposed by
Davis could force administration officials and the conference
committee headed by Peace to fill a gap of the same amount,
presumably by making deeper program cuts or raising taxes.</TE>
<TE>   The Assembly's Republican leader, Dave Cox of Fair Oaks, blamed
Democrats for Thursday's showdown, noting that they had rejected a
proposal by his caucus.</TE>
<TE>   "We simply believe it's time for students to be treated on a fair
and equitable basis," Cox said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the governor's aides, Cabinet Secretary Susan Kennedy, saw
it another way, however.</TE>
<TE>   "The Republicans are holding our children's education dollars
hostage," Kennedy said.</TE>
<TE>   Finance Director Tim Gage warned that the education shift is a key
part of the governor's larger plan to get the state out of the
red--an issue of concern to Wall Street investors who lend money to
the state.</TE>
<TE>   A meeting between Cox and Kennedy on Thursday ended without
resolution. The governor's proposal could come up for reconsideration
when the Assembly meets Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Still pending in the Senate is a measure containing the governor's
proposals to shift a little more than $1 billion in transportation
money to help shrink the budget shortfall. About $127 million of that
amount comes from the current budget.</TE>
<TE>   But it's the education bill, with its hefty dollar amount, that is
the biggest concern to the Capitol's Democratic leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "This bill today is the easy part of balancing the budget," said
Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento). "If we don't make this
decision, ask yourself where are you going to make up $1.7 billion?"</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Thomas Calderon (D-Montebello) accused Republicans of
holding up the budget to embarrass Davis, who is seeking reelection.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't about politics," countered Assemblywoman Lynn Daucher
(R-Brea). "This is truly about children. We have a golden opportunity
to fix something in this state."</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Russ Bogh (R-Cherry Valley) said the $1.7-billion
shift would be an "irresponsible" cut to education.</TE>
<TE>   An even bigger issue dividing Republicans and Democrats is taxes.
The conference committee has yet to sign off on $3.8 billion in
higher taxes and other new revenue proposed by Davis, but did vote
Wednesday night to suspend a tax credit for teachers and a solar
energy tax credit.</TE>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A broad environmental coalition boosted election-year pressure
Thursday on Gov. Gray Davis, calling for his state water regulators
to wade into the fight over clear-cut logging in California forests.</LD>
<LD>   The Sierra Club, fishing groups and other preservationists contend
that the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection has
failed to control muddy runoff into streams from timber harvests on
private lands.</LD>
<LD>   The coalition asked that the state Water Resources Control Board
wrest away oversight from the forestry department. During a noontime
rally in a downtown Sacramento park, they called on the governor to
push for the change.</LD>
<TE>   Carl Zichella, the Sierra Club's state director, said Davis has
received hefty campaign contributions from logging firms but could
rally the enthusiasm of environmentalists by stemming clear-cut
logging.</TE>
<TE>   "He has the power," Zichella said, adding that it remains up to
the governor "to show he's not bought by those companies."</TE>
<TE>   Campaign records show that Davis has received about $450,000 from
timber interests since 1999. But such political contributions "have
never had any impact on this governor's policy decisions," said Roger
Salazar, a Davis campaign spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1988, state water regulators have largely ceded
responsibility to the forestry department for ensuring that logging
does not impair water quality. The department has failed miserably at
that job, environmentalists charged in a 20-page petition.</TE>
<TE>   They say clear-cut logging denudes hillsides and causes muddy
runoff to cascade into streams, fouling fish spawning grounds,
ruining water quality and flooding downstream residents.</TE>
<TE>   "It is time to take the [forestry department] out of the driver's
seat and end this terrible ride to nowhere," said Cynthia Elkins of
the Environmental Protection Information Center, a North Coast
anti-logging group.</TE>
<TE>   "This is America--everyone has the right to complain," said Karen
Terrill, a spokeswoman for the forestry department. But she said the
agency passionately enforces the state's water quality laws.</TE>
<TE>   An industry spokesman said timber firms now operate under the
tightest environmental restrictions and go through the most
exhaustive logging review in the country, with state water regulators
often weighing in.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hugely complex," said Dave Bischel, president of the
California Forestry Assn. "Can you imagine if the farmer who wants to
go out and plant his corn and harvest it had to go through this
process every year?"</TE>
<TE>   Water regulators have long argued that they lack the staffing to
carefully review each of the timber harvest plans that precede any
logging in California's privately owned forests.</TE>
<TE>   A state water board spokeswoman said the panel's legal staff will
need to review the petition before the board can respond.</TE>
<TE>   The push for tougher water monitoring comes at a critical juncture
in California's timber wars.</TE>
<TE>   On the North Coast, Pacific Lumber Co. has resumed clear-cut
logging in the Elk River watershed, where heavy timber harvesting in
the 1990s is blamed for problems suffered by downstream residents.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, state water regulators ordered the North Coast
Regional Water Quality Control Board to consider stepping in.</TE>
<TE>   But the regional board balked after a two-day hearing, drawing
howls of protest from environmentalists in Humboldt County.</TE>

<HD>4 Held in Killing of Man Stabbed at Club</HD>
<DH>Arrests: Suspected gang members may face hate penalty in
Riverside attack outside gay bar.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four reputed Riverside gang members were arrested Thursday on
suspicion of murdering a man and assaulting a second earlier this
month because the victims were gay.</LD>
<LD>   "The only motive for the attack was hatred. Not robbery, not
anything else," Riverside Police Chief Russell Leach said in
announcing the arrests.</LD>
<LD>   Moreno Valley resident Jeffery Owens, 40, died of multiple stab
wounds to the back on June 5, six hours after he had been stabbed
outside Menagerie, a downtown Riverside nightclub popular with gay
men.</LD>
<TE>   Owens was trying to come to the defense of his friend Michael
Bussee, 48, who said he was punched in the face and stabbed as he
chatted with friends in the parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   "You want some trouble ... fag, here it is," one attacker yelled
at Owens before jabbing a knife into him, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Viviano Cruz Martin, 25; Miguel Angel Ramos, 28; and Ramin Meza
Rabago, 18, were held on counts of murder and participation in a
criminal street gang--crimes that could carry enhanced penalties if
they are judged to be hate crimes. Dorian Lee Gutierrez, 18, was
arrested on the same charges, and an additional charge of attempted
murder for attacking Bussee.</TE>
<TE>   Friends and acquaintances of the victims were among those who
expressed satisfaction, and relief, after announcement of the
arrests.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been screaming with happiness all day," said Philip
Bailey, a bartender at Menagerie.</TE>
<TE>   Bussee, a family and marriage counselor, said he learned of the
arrests in a phone call from his mother. Trembling visibly, Bussee
stood Thursday afternoon in the parking lot where the attacks
occurred, next to a memorial shrine of flowers, photographs and chalk
engravings on the sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been shaking for two weeks. It's been very weird thinking
there were people out there who did this," he said. "There's a
feeling of relief. I'm happy, but I'm still scared....I'm really,
really grateful for the way the Police Department handled this. They
were just wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   Bussee's sentiments were echoed by other community members and
even police, who have worked hard to restore trust in the city since
the 1998 fatal shooting by white officers of Tyisha Miller, a
19-year-old black woman.</TE>
<TE>   "This one feels good," said Lt. John Wallace, a department
spokesman. As part of a series of changes following the Miller case,
police officers have undergone two years of hate-crime training.</TE>
<TE>   There were 45 reported hate crimes in Riverside in 2001, up from
38 the year before.</TE>
<TE>   That includes 10 crimes against people of Middle Eastern descent
after Sept. 11, Wallace said, and five against people because of
their sexual orientation.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Leach said evidence indicated the attack had been planned in
advance.</TE>
<TE>   He said an outpouring of tips from the community, combined with
aggressive police work, led to Thursday's arrests. Police are seeking
other witnesses and other possible suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Anne Corrado said she expected to file formal
charges late Thursday or early today. Arraignment is expected this
afternoon. The men could face life in prison without parole if a jury
finds them guilty of murder as a hate crime.</TE>
<TE>   Bussee said he has been visiting the attack site every day,
removing dead flowers and sprucing up the shrine. "It's kind of like
visiting a grave site," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he was proud of the outpouring of support from residents
of all kinds from this diverse city, the state's 11th largest.</TE>
<TE>   "It shocked the whole community, not just the gay community,"
Bussee said. "We had 500 people at a vigil, people with babies in
strollers, elderly people, people of color. And the police were
there, too. That was very moving to me."</TE>
<TE>   But he said he was not surprised.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have expected nothing less from Riverside," said Bussee,
who was born and raised here.</TE>

<HD>Former Aide Sues Holden</HD>
<DH>Council: Suit says he was forced to work on political
campaigns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former field deputy to Los Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden
charged in a federal lawsuit Thursday that he was forced to work on
the councilman's political campaigns on city time.</LD>
<LD>   Ronald Mayberry, 55, filed a suit against Holden and the city over
his dismissal last June while on medical leave for treatment of
diabetes. He accused Holden of violating his federal rights to due
process as well as his rights under state disability laws.</LD>
<LD>   Holden, responding though an aide, described Mayberry as a
disgruntled former employee.</LD>
<TE>   Mayberry says he went to work for the councilman in 1997. In 1999,
he said, he was diverted to work on Holden's 10th District reelection
campaign and on the campaign of Holden's son, Chris, who was running
for mayor of Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   "For Mr. Mayberry and for many other city employees, there was no
choice but to work on the campaign," his suit charges. "Holden made
it quite clear that if Mr. Mayberry intended to be part of his staff,
then he was obligated to work on the campaign even during city time."</TE>
<TE>   Holden wound up in a runoff, and Mayberry said he continued to
spend most of his on-the-job time working telephones at Holden's
campaign headquarters. He said he was told not to let anybody,
including his wife, know his whereabouts.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, Holden ran unsuccessfully in a special election to fill a
vacancy created by the death of Rep. Julian Dixon (D-Los Angeles).
Mayberry says he spent all of his time working out of the campaign's
Culver City office.</TE>
<TE>   After being defeated, Holden berated him for the loss, Mayberry
said, and suspended him for two days as punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Mayberry, a diabetic, says the stress caused his blood pressure
and glucose levels to rise dangerously. Following his doctor's
orders, he says, he took a medical leave of absence using accumulated
sick time. Holden then fired him without justification, he says.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ending one of Orange County's strangest election dramas, a Superior
Court judge who had sought a second term while facing child
pornography and molestation charges won permission Thursday to drop
out of the upcoming election.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Ronald C. Kline had asked to remove his name from the ballot
after failing to win a majority of votes in the March primary
election, forcing him into a November runoff with one of the many
write-in candidates who campaigned against him.</LD>
<LD>   His withdrawal was opposed by county election officials and his
top-vote-getting write-in opponent, who argued that it was too late.</LD>
<TE>   But Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge David P. Yaffe on
Thursday ruled that Kline's request was timely and ordered the Orange
County registrar of voters to remove Kline from the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "The judge made the right call.... The election controversy is now
over," Kline's attorney, Paul S. Meyer, said in a written statement
after the ruling. "We will focus our full attention on the legal
defense of charges."</TE>
<TE>   Kline, who remains under house arrest pending the outcome of his
criminal cases, had argued that remaining on the ballot could
undermine his chances of receiving a fair trail.</TE>
<TE>   The 61-year-old jurist faces federal charges of possessing
pornographic images of children on his home and courthouse computers
and state charges of molesting a 14-year-old boy a quarter-century
ago. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.</TE>
<TE>   Kline's attempt to remove his name from the ballot was given
little chance by most legal experts. Election law makes it difficult
for candidates to drop out, and judges have rarely ruled on the
issue.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the county registrar of voters argued that Kline could
not withdraw once voters cast their ballots in the March 5 primary.
But Yaffe ruled that Kline became a qualified candidate in the
upcoming run-off only when the Board of Supervisors certified the
primary's results on March 25. By that stage, Kline had already asked
to withdraw.</TE>
<TE>   County attorneys, as well as Dana Point attorney John Adams, the
write-in candidate who opposed Kline's attempt to withdraw, all said
they have no plans to appeal the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy that it's over," said Adams, who was the top
vote-getter in the primary election. "It's been a distraction. Now we
can move on to the fall election."</TE>
<TE>   While Thursday's ruling ended Kline's candidacy, it remains
undecided whose name might appear with Adams' on the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The county plans to list only Adams' name. But attorney Gay
Sandoval, the runner-up among write-in candidates in the primary,
said she hopes county officials will add her name now that Kline's
has been removed. If they refuse, she said, she will probably ask the
courts to intervene.</TE>

<HD>Robert Loeffler, 79; Securities Law Expert Cleaned Up
Firm's Scandal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert M. Loeffler, an attorney and court-appointed trustee praised
for restructuring the scandal-ridden Equity Funding Corp. of America
life insurance and securities firm in the mid-1970s after it was
caught writing fictitious insurance policies to inflate assets, has
died. He was 79.</LD>
<LD>   Loeffler died Tuesday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center of cancer,
said his longtime friend and colleague, attorney William D. Gould.</LD>
<LD>   A respected expert on securities law, the soft-spoken and
unflappable Loeffler was a court-appointed examiner in the San
Diego-based Wickes Cos.' bankruptcy case in 1982. Five years later he
became the turn-around chairman who carefully extracted San
Diego-based Northview Corp., owner of 43 motels, from the
insider-trading scandal engulfing its former chairman, Ivan Boesky.</LD>
<TE>   But Loeffler gained his greatest reputation for his work on the
Equity Funding case. He was so admired for untangling the troubled
company and 81 subsidiaries, most of them bogus, that he became the
leading candidate for chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission in 1977. Instead, he took himself out of the running to
accept a job establishing and managing a Los Angeles office for the
Washington, D.C.-based law firm of Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyer had spent eight years as senior vice president and
general counsel of the Minneapolis-based Investors Diversified
Service Inc., a mutual funds management company, when U.S. District
Court Judge Harry Pregerson picked him on April 10, 1973, to
"reorganize and rehabilitate" Los Angeles-based Equity Funding under
federal bankruptcy laws. The SEC had suggested that Pregerson tap
Loeffler.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, the Equity Funding scandal was considered the largest
fraud case in corporate history.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-two former Equity Funding executives were indicted for
fraud and most, including ousted Chairman Stanley Goldblum and
President Fred Levin, went to jail. About 100 lawsuits, including 76
class actions, were filed by bilked Equity Funding investors against
the company, its auditors and the manufacturer of the computer used
in the deceptive accounting.</TE>
<TE>   In 1972, Fortune magazine had touted Equity Funding as the fastest
growing company of its type in the country, based on its stated net
worth of $143.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   But in March 1973, the SEC and the California Insurance Department
learned that the firm had published false financial results for
years. They filed complaints stating that the financial conglomerate
had doctored its books, inflated its assets and sold phony life
insurance policies to its insurance competitors. The top officers of
the company were removed, and the firm filed for bankruptcy that
April 5 to keep creditor banks from seizing its assets.</TE>
<TE>   Loeffler's investigation determined that the insurance fraud "was
merely the last phase of what should be seen as a classic stock
fraud," with Equity Funding's behavior designed to pump up its stock
price by falsely inflating earnings "through every means available to
the conspirators."</TE>
<TE>   Instead of a net worth of $143.4 million, he found a negative
worth of $42 million.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not a well-planned, well-executed operation," Loeffler
wrote in his 239-page report to Pregerson in the fall of 1974.
"Instead, it was helter-skelter, hand-to-mouth--a monstrous thing in
which new frauds had to be frantically concocted to cover up bigger,
more obvious ones."</TE>
<TE>   That the fraud went undiscovered from roughly 1964 until 1973, he
reported, was due to "lies, luck, the audacity of the conspirators
and, just as important, to the glaring failure of the auditors to
discharge their obligations properly."</TE>
<TE>   Loeffler was instructed to oversee operations of Equity Funding
and its subsidiaries, determine the economic viability and
possibility of reorganization, restructure operations, negotiate the
sales of unnecessary subsidiaries such as a cattle breeding
operation, formulate a reorganization plan, negotiate the resolution
of hundreds of millions of dollars in claims, obtain court and
creditors' approval, and then oversee the actual reorganization.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how many lawyers there are in the U.S.," he said
about midway through the job, "but I'm sure half of them are involved
in this case."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, by Oct. 12, 1976, he had transferred the remaining
assets to a new company, Orion Capital Corp., and worked himself out
of a job. He accomplished in only three years a task that normally
requires seven.</TE>
<TE>   A native of Bristow, Okla., Loeffler served as a Navy officer
during World War II and earned a bachelor's degree in business
administration from the University of Oklahoma. He also got a law
degree from Harvard, where he was an editor of its Law Review.</TE>
<TE>   He practiced law in New York with the firm of Donovan, Leisure,
Newton &amp; Irvine from 1948 until joining Investors Diversified
Services in Minneapolis in 1965.</TE>
<TE>   After his work with Equity Funding, Loeffler spent nearly a decade
establishing and running the Los Angeles office of Jones, Day and in
1987 was board chairman, president and chief executive officer of
Northview Corp., reorganizing it after the Boesky scandal. Since
then, he had been of counsel to the Los Angeles law firm of Wyman,
Bautzer, Kuchel &amp; Silbert.</TE>
<TE>   Divorced from his wife, Marjorie, Loeffler is survived by their
two children, Robert M. Jr. and Karen, and two grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   The family has asked that any memorial donations be sent to the
American Cancer Society.</TE>

<HD>Earl Miller, 77; Invented Safer Type of Ski Binding</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HYMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Earl A. Miller was a ski technician with the heart of a car salesman.
When it came to closing a deal, Miller would do anything, even if it
meant cartwheeling and crashing down the mountain at 50 mph to prove
his point.</LD>
<LD>   Miller, who invented a novel, safer version of the ski binding,
died June 14 in Owensville, Mo. He was 77.</LD>
<LD>   One of the thorniest technological problems facing ski designers
has always been how to keep a skier's feet attached to the skis. In
the sport's early days, this was either done with leather straps or
cables.</LD>
<TE>   The problem was that the long, wooden skis stayed attached to
skiers during a crash. As a result, schussers would go bouncing down
the mountain with their legs twisted in profoundly unnatural ways.
Or, they could suffocate, unable to struggle back to their feet from
immense drifts or tree wells.</TE>
<TE>   Bones weren't just broken--they often shattered into tiny pieces.
Yet many of the injuries were accepted by rugged skiers as a price
they were willing to pay. "The stereotype was that if you skied back
then, you should be spending half the winter in a cast," said Matthew
Miller, Earl's son.</TE>
<TE>   Earl Miller was born in Manti, Utah, in 1925. He grew up winning
ski tournaments throughout the Wasatch Mountains and later piloted
Mustang fighters during World War II. After the war, he was a ski
instructor at the Alta ski resort near Salt Lake City, where he made
up his mind that skiing was unnecessarily dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, ski bindings released a ski boot only at one angle.
Miller's new "step in multiple release binding," which appeared in
the early 1950s, released boots at several angles, allowing skiers to
escape more types of crashes.</TE>
<TE>   He developed the binding by studying exactly how much force it
took to break a human bone. Occasionally, research efforts involved
cadavers.</TE>
<TE>   To prove the effectiveness of his new bindings to customers at
different resorts, Miller would purposely crash at 50 mph. He would
then dare skiers to do the same thing on competitors' skis. If they
emerged unscathed, he promised them $500--and then would add, "Bring
your own crutches."</TE>
<TE>   Few took the offer.</TE>
<TE>   Miller's solution to one problem created another dilemma. When
skis and skiers were separated, runaway skis had an unfortunate
tendency to zoom several hundred feet down the mountain. To retrieve
their equipment, skiers had to either walk or slide down the
slopes--an often treacherous task.</TE>
<TE>   In response, Miller perfected the ski brake, two stick-like
devices that dug into the snow and kept downed skiers and their skis
in the same general vicinity.</TE>
<TE>   Miller eventually founded Miller Ski Co., based in Orem, Utah,
which today is known as Miller Snowboard Corp.</TE>
<TE>   He held more than 100 patents for ski-related technology, had a
hand in developing several resorts and was one of the founders of the
Professional Ski Instructors of America. Miller was inducted into the
National Ski Hall of Fame in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Miller is survived by his wife, Elaine; son, Matthew; and
daughters Jill Tarbet, Lisa Miller and Kim Miller.</TE>

<HD>It Might Already Be Too Late for the Accused Thief to Blow
Over a New Leaf</HD>

<LD>The Seal Beach Sun reports that a man "was attempting to open a car
door" when the owner arrived, at which point the intruder "threatened
him with a leaf blower." Luckily, police arrested the guy before he
could blow away the victim. The suspect could face additional
charges--it's not clear whether he was in compliance with local noise
ordinances.</LD>
<LD>   Grin and bare it: Donna Kriesel read in the Los Alamitos
News-Enterprise's police log that "some 10 youths were seen naked,
sitting in a red Taurus" on Pacific Coast Highway in Seal Beach. A
sign of summer's approach? Or could they have been leaf-blower
victims?</LD>
<LD>   Unclear on the concept: Doug Stokes of Duarte noticed an ad for a
product that will give you more than one time of the day (see
accompanying).</LD>
<TE>   In Oregon, Mike Evans of La Mesa found an espresso joint that has
some other hot offerings (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Creature comforts: For those looking for a place to keep their
potbellied pig, Nancy LeBlanc of Laguna Niguel has a suggestion (see
accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Deal's off: I won't be signing a wrestling crustacean to a
contract after all. You may recall my mention of the menu that
offered "shrimp grappling with beacon." Little guy taking on a
lighthouse? Actually, writes A. Trujillo Escareno, it should be
"shrimp wrapped in bacon."</TE>
<TE>   Know your suburbs: San Fernando Valleyites complain that they're
overlooked by City Hall. But the area's contributions aren't
neglected by Teri Davis Greenberg in her new book, "California
Firsts: The Famous, Infamous and Quirky of the Golden State."</TE>
<TE>   For example, she relates that the creator of the Ant Farm kit came
up with the idea in 1956 at a "Fourth of July backyard picnic at his
sister's San Fernando Valley home."</TE>
<TE>   As founder Milton Levine told the story, the children present
"were more interested in lying around and watching ant hills than
swimming in the pool."</TE>
<TE>   Crawling right along: Greenberg says that the Mojave Desert,
northeast of L.A., has been a major source of ants for Levine's
business. "Some ant catchers use straws to blow air at ants and then
catch them as they flee," she wrote. Another technique: "Use a car
vacuum connected to a Tupperware container." Why am I thinking of
leaf blowers again?</TE>

<HD>Arson Patrol Ready to Roll</HD>
<DH>Holiday: Ventura County fire chief plans to use volunteers
to report illegal use of fireworks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He can't stop Fillmore from selling fireworks. But Ventura County
Fire Chief Bob Roper has a warning for those who set them off outside
the city: Someone may be watching.</LD>
<LD>   As Southern California faces what may be its worst fire season to
date, the fire chief in this brush-covered county is activating a
brigade of "citizen arson patrols."</LD>
<LD>   Equipped with notepads, pens, radios and cellular phones, about
two dozen volunteers will roam Ojai, Thousand Oaks and other
fire-prone areas during Fourth of July week. They will jot down the
license plate numbers of suspicious vehicles parked in the woods and
call authorities to report any fireworks sightings.</LD>
<TE>   No doubt, some volunteers will face the ire of Independence Day
revelers who will question their patriotism. With the help of his
patrols, Roper said, authorities will confiscate fireworks and issue
citations with a vengeance.</TE>
<TE>   Violators face a maximum fine of $1,000 and up to one year in jail
for unauthorized use of so-called safe-and-sane fireworks. Jail time
and fines of up to $5,000 may be imposed if the fireworks are among
the more powerful kind banned by the state.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to be out there in an enforcement mode more than
we've been in the past," Roper said. Of the wide range of devices he
is prepared to seize, he said, "We don't care whether they're 'safe
and sane' or illegal. They're an ignition source."</TE>
<TE>   In California, the state fire marshal has approved a list of
safe-and-sane fireworks. These are safer than fireworks prohibited by
the state because they do not explode, dart across the ground or lift
into the air. Still, they burn at high temperatures and have started
fires.</TE>
<TE>   Local jurisdictions, however, have the power to ban the sale and
use of all fireworks within their boundaries, including the types
approved by the state. In California, 229 cities allow safe-and-sane
fireworks.</TE>
<TE>   Fillmore is the only city in Ventura County that allows them. In
recent years, at least nine fires throughout the county have been
sparked by fireworks, with the largest burning 4,300 acres in the
Ojai Valley in 1999. Firefighting costs have totaled more than $5.6
million.</TE>
<TE>   For years, residents throughout the county and the San Fernando
Valley have flocked to Fillmore's fireworks booths, run by civic
groups, to stock up for block parties in their own neighborhoods.
They are violating the law, but it's a law authorities say is
difficult to enforce.</TE>
<TE>   This year, California, Colorado and other Western states have been
swept by brush fires, including a 22,000-acre blaze that began June 1
in Los Padres National Forest north of Ojai. As a result, Roper said
he is serious about keeping fireworks away from amateurs.</TE>
<TE>   The county Board of Supervisors earlier this month urged Fillmore
officials to halt roadside sales altogether. City officials declined,
arguing that it is unfair to punish local civic groups that earn
thousands of dollars from fireworks sales. They also said banning
safe-and-sane fireworks would only encourage use of the illegal kind.</TE>
<TE>   With no power to regulate sales in Fillmore, Roper has shifted his
focus to fireworks enthusiasts who live outside the city. He printed
25,000 fliers--which the city has agreed to distribute with each
fireworks purchase--notifying customers that their items can be
confiscated the minute they leave Fillmore's city limits.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities won't be pulling drivers over to inspect their trunks.
But if the citizen arson patrol spots anyone with fireworks, it's
their job to report them.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the patrols were culled from the county sheriff's disaster
assistance teams and have training dealing with earthquakes, fires
and searches for missing people. Fire Department spokeswoman Sandi
Wells said the county's first arson patrol was formed in 1993, after
a spate of fires burned across eastern portions of the county.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, volunteers have been called out a few times but keep a
low profile. No arrests have been made based on tips from the
patrols, but Wells said this year's is the best-organized effort yet.</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks resident Helen Tallen is one of the volunteers. The
50-year-old Montessori school teacher leads her local disaster
assistance response team. She has searched for missing people and
helped authorities manage a compost fire, but this will be her first
stint on the arson patrol.</TE>
<TE>   Tallen has fond memories of July 4 celebrations, but also
remembers, as a little girl, injuring her father when he gave her a
sparkler to play with.</TE>
<TE>   "If they're in the wrong hands, they're dangerous," Tallen said.
"This is such an extreme drought time for us. It's nothing to be
playing with, especially this year."</TE>
<TE>   She isn't expecting any grief from neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   "We're right up against the wilderness," she said. "Everybody in
this neighborhood is very much on the same page. No fireworks. Nobody
wants to see this neighborhood go up in flames, and we could very
easily."</TE>

<HD>Perot Systems Posts Energy 'Gaming' Files</HD>
<DH>Probe: The company puts subpoenaed records on Web, showing
efforts to sell market strategies. It denies improper use of
confidential state data.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL and TIM REITERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Documents made public Thursday by Perot Systems suggest more
extensive efforts than previously acknowledged by the Texas company
to sell energy firms a blueprint for gaming California's electricity
market.</LD>
<LD>   Perot Systems offered in 1997 and 1998 to help Enron Corp. and the
state's major utilities earn "unexpected" profits, even as it was
helping to set up the computer systems that would run California's
power market.</LD>
<LD>   The documents show that Perot Systems peddled its knowledge of
holes in the market to Enron, Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas
&amp; Electric and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric. None of the companies
pursued business with Perot Systems. But the pitches amount to a more
extensive marketing effort than the company has implied, said Sen.
Joe Dunn (D-Garden Grove), chairman of a legislative committee
investigating manipulation of the state's defunct power market.</LD>
<TE>   "The deeper we dig with respect to the Perot Systems' involvement
in the California energy crisis, the more involved they become,
contrary to their public statements," Dunn said.</TE>
<TE>   In a conference call with investors earlier this month, Perot
Systems founder H. Ross Perot, a former presidential candidate, said
his company made several presentations about the California power
market but found little interest.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn said the new disclosures raise questions about whether Perot
Systems violated the conflict-of-interest portion of its contract
with the California Independent System Operator, the agency
established to manage most of the state's transmission grid under a
deregulation plan.</TE>
<TE>   Cal-ISO hired Perot Systems in March 1997 to help set up and test
computer software. In 1998, the Power Exchange, the state's main
marketplace for electricity, also hired the company.</TE>
<TE>   Perot Systems officials said Thursday that the company never
improperly disclosed any confidential information gleaned from its
work for Cal-ISO and the Power Exchange. The thousands of pages of
documents made public on the company's Web site were subpoenaed by
state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer and given to Dunn's committee.</TE>
<TE>   They include a letter written April 8, 1998--one week after the
California market first opened--from Perot Systems employee Ed Smith
to Rich Davis, a vice president in Enron's trading arm.</TE>
<TE>   "There is already evidence that participants in the CA PX/ISO are
delivering micro-probes (small, 'unusual' bids) designed to find the
weaknesses in the system and the software," Smith wrote. "It is clear
that many holes in the system exist that could be used to deliver
'unexpected' profits."</TE>
<TE>   The letter goes on to describe several specific strategies Enron
could use to raise prices, including one involving a small
transmission line called Silver Peak that brings power to California
from Nevada. Smith's letter suggests that Enron could profit by
scheduling to move more electricity than certain transmission lines
can handle.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Enron paid a $25,000 settlement to the Power Exchange for
intentionally scheduling 2,900 megawatts of electricity over the
Silver Peak line, which can handle roughly 15 megawatts.</TE>
<TE>   Enron spokesman Eric Thode said it would be impossible to know if
Perot Systems influenced Enron traders in the Silver Peak incident.
"The employees that those pitches were made to are no longer with the
company," Thode said.</TE>
<TE>   The documents released Thursday also include a May 7, 1997, memo
that describes a meeting between Perot Systems and Southern
California Edison officials. Dunn called the memo "disturbing."</TE>
<TE>   The memo indicates that William Heller, then vice president for
strategic planning at Edison, wanted the company to set up a system
for Edison to evaluate "gaming options."</TE>
<TE>   Subsequent memos said such knowledge would assist Edison in two
ways: protecting itself against predatory companies and maximizing
revenue from generation.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Foster, president of Southern California Edison, said the
company had not yet reviewed the documents but noted that the utility
did not hire Perot Systems.</TE>
<TE>   He said that Edison had no incentive to try to manipulate the
market to get higher prices for its generation because, under
deregulation rules, it is constrained from making a profit on the
energy.</TE>

<HD>Man to Pay $2,500 Fine for Altering Sespe Creek</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Fillmore man who used a truckload of concrete to alter a portion of
Sespe Creek in front of his home has agreed to pay a $2,500 fine, a
prosecutor said this week.</LD>
<LD>   William Leo Douglas allegedly failed to obtain the proper permit
to alter the waterway in late 1999. He wanted to make the changes
because of flooding problems caused by the creek, the prosecutor
said.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Laurel McWaters said Douglas, 60, has restored
most of the stream bed to its original form and is continuing to
comply with a court agreement that outlines what alterations can be
made.</LD>
<TE>   As part of the civil judgment that was reached last week, Douglas
did not admit any wrongdoing but agreed to give $1,250 to a county
fish and wildlife fund and $1,250 to a state fish and game
preservation fund.</TE>

<HD>State Urged to Move on Ride Safety Law</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- Tearful mothers of children killed or injured on
amusement park rides urged state officials Thursday to speed up the
process and finish regulations for a safety law that was passed
nearly three years ago.</LD>
<LD>   La Jolla mother Kathy Fackler, founder of the Saferparks advocacy
group, criticized the state's political process and the powerful
amusement park industry for the drawn-out process.</LD>
<LD>   "If this state can't muster enough integrity to pull together a
credible accident prevention system for thrill rides in less time
than it took to win World War II, then we, as a culture, are surely
doomed," Fackler said.</LD>
<TE>   Fackler, whose son was injured in 1998 on a Disneyland roller
coaster, vowed to be a watchdog over the process and bear witness on
behalf of victims.</TE>
<TE>   She rattled off a list: "Quimby Ghilotti, dead at age 18; David
Fackler, amputee at age 5; Josh Smurphat, dead at age 12; Brandon
Zucker, brain-damaged at age 4. Rocio Estrada, quadriplegic at age
17; Lori Mason-Larez, wife and mother of four, dead at age 40."</TE>
<TE>   "That list will grow longer before the next public hearing,"
Fackler said.</TE>
<TE>   From the audience, there were tears and sniffles as the California
Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board listened to the four
mothers who pleaded with board members to follow through with the
law's intent and focus on accident prevention.</TE>
<TE>   The law gives the state Division of Occupational Safety and Health
authority over amusement parks. Since January 2000, parks have been
reporting injuries and have been subject to accident investigations.
This year the state will begin annual ride inspections.</TE>
<TE>   Although parts of the law are in effect, the regulations that
spell out the safety requirements and penalties for failing to comply
have yet to be completed.</TE>
<TE>   At Thursday's public hearing, the Standards Board met to consider
the second of three sets of regulations for the law.</TE>
<TE>   Board member Victoria Bradshaw said that despite the lengthy
process, she sees progress. Both sides seem to be communicating and
agreeing on more issues.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to expedite what is a very cumbersome process for an
end product that is not only effective but workable," Bradshaw said.</TE>
<TE>   In many cases, the two sides of the amusement park safety issue
have battled over technical wording. Thursday, there was little
disagreement but debate again over language choices.</TE>
<TE>   The most controversial area involved restricting certain people
from getting on rides. The state asked parks to make special
considerations for weight, size, children, physical disabilities,
health conditions that affect rider safety and "apparent mental
disability."</TE>
<TE>   But park officials, who mostly submitted written comments,
expressed concern about violating antidiscrimination laws. In a memo
filed by the Walt Disney Co., officials said they could be sued if
they use subjective judgments.</TE>
<TE>   The state occupational safety division must respond to each
concern before the regulations can be finalized and will seek a legal
opinion whether their wording violates any laws, said Len Welsh, the
division's special counsel.</TE>
<TE>   For Victoria Zucker, mother of the boy who was brain-damaged on
Disneyland's Roger Rabbit Car Toon Spin, her talk before the
Standards Board was part of a healing process; it was the first time
she has spoken in an advocacy role since Brandon's accident in
September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   She traveled from Irvine to Sacramento for the hearing, bringing
photographs of 6-year-old Brandon. She showed the board one picture
taken at Disneyland, minutes before the accident. He is sitting next
to his brother Nicholas on the Roger Rabbit ride. Both are wearing
their Mickey Mouse ears and huge grins.</TE>
<TE>   A second picture,  taken hours later, shows Brandon in a hospital
bed, bandaged, with tubes taped to his limbs and mouth.</TE>
<TE>   "He can't speak. He can't talk. He can't walk," Victoria Zucker
said. "I haven't heard a word from him since that night. I'm here to
say I don't want anything like this to happen to another family."</TE>

which one.</LD>
<LD>   Levenson and her passenger, James Woolsey, 44, were taken to Henry
Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital, where Levenson was pronounced dead
Thursday morning, Lorenzi said. Woolsey is in critical condition.</LD>
<TE>   The truck, driven by Hector Guzman, 33, overturned. He had minor
injuries and was treated at the scene, Lorenzi said.</TE>

<HD>George Sotelo, 78; an Advocate for Civil Rights</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>George Sotelo, an early crusader for Mexican American civil rights
who helped launch influential advocacy groups in California, died
June 12 of cancer at the USC-Norris Cancer Center in Los Angeles. He
was 78.</LD>
<LD>   The longtime Pasadena resident played a leading role in
establishing California chapters of the American GI Forum, the
nation's oldest and largest Latino veterans organization. He helped
found the state's first chapter in Los Angeles in 1957 and served as
the statewide executive director for several years.</LD>
<LD>   He was a founding member of the Mexican American Political Assn.,
the advocacy group founded after World War II that helped elect Ed
Roybal, the first California Latino in Congress, and was influential
in obtaining appointments for Mexican Americans in the
administrations of California Gov. Pat Brown and President Lyndon B.
Johnson.</LD>
<TE>   "He was very stubborn in trying to remedy some of the injustices
faced by our community," said retired Superior Court Judge Leopoldo
G. Sanchez, one of the first Latinos elected to a judgeship in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Sotelo belonged to a generation whose sacrifices in World War II
awakened them to the rights and privileges of American citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   He was born in Pasadena and raised in the Central Valley, where
his parents were farm workers. After graduating from high school in
Fresno, he worked briefly in a cannery, then enrolled at Pasadena
City College. Then, with America about to enter World War II, he
volunteered for military service and became a paratrooper trainer at
Ft. Benning in Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   In the South, he was "subjected to a lot of racial discrimination,
something he never tasted in Los Angeles," said Eddie M. Ramirez, a
pharmacist who, along with Sanchez, was an early member of the
American GI Forum in Los Angeles. "He had a rude awakening, and he
responded to the best of his ability. He was someone who stood up for
what he thought was right."</TE>
<TE>   The American GI Forum was founded in 1948 by Dr. Hector P. Garcia,
who was then battling the Naval Air Station in Corpus Christi, Texas,
to accept sick Latinos who were World War II veterans. The group
earned national attention over a controversy in Three Rivers, Texas,
where the town's only funeral parlor had refused to host services for
a Mexican American soldier killed in the war. He ultimately was
interred at Arlington National Cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   After completing his military duty in 1946, Sotelo got married and
started a family. He operated heavy construction machinery and in the
early 1950s became one of the first Mexican American members of the
Operating Engineers Union, according to son-in-law Kenneth Burt, a
visiting scholar at UC Berkeley who is writing a history of Mexican
Americans in California politics.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez recalled that Latinos in California had no major
organization fighting for their rights in the years immediately after
the war. Sotelo, he said, was "the moving force to start the American
GI Forum in Los Angeles." About a dozen people came to a meeting in
East Los Angeles in 1957 that Sotelo called to recruit members.</TE>
<TE>   Sotelo, Sanchez and others established the Los Angeles chapter,
then spent their spare hours drumming up support in other cities from
Bakersfield to San Diego. They gave scholarships to encourage Latinos
to finish high school and pursue college. They fought political
gerrymandering, job and housing discrimination and unfair enforcement
of curfew laws.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles chapter became a network for most of Los Angeles'
early Latino elected officials, such as Roybal, who in 1949 had
become the first Mexican American elected to the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   Sotelo and other forum members helped to elect Sam Yorty mayor in
1961. Yorty later named Richard Tafoya as Los Angeles's first Mexican
American deputy mayor. In 1962, Roybal was elected to Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Such victories, fueled by the grass-roots energy of groups such as
the forum, laid the groundwork for Mexican American community
activism in the second half of the 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   "Few people today appreciate how important these early struggles
were," said Burt.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a great untold story with numerous unsung heroes" such as
Sotelo.</TE>
<TE>   Although he paved the way for many key Latino appointments, Sotelo
never sought one for himself.</TE>
<TE>   He was proudest of his children's educational successes: All six
attended college.</TE>
<TE>   Sotelo is survived by his wife of 57 years, Margarita Pompo
Sotelo; daughters Sally Chriss of Alamo, Calif., Brenda Bosworth of
Woodinville, Wash., Sonia Burt of Sacramento, and Isila Oliver of
Palo Alto; sons George, of Upland, and Mario, of Pasadena; and seven
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   His funeral will be held at 10:30 a.m. today at St. Elizabeth's
Catholic Church, 1879 N. Lake St., Altadena. Memorial donations may
be sent to St. Jude Children's Hospital, 501 St. Jude Place, Memphis,
Tenn. 38105.</TE>

<HD>New Fire Spreads in Angeles Forest</HD>
<DH>Firefighting: As Gorman blaze dies, crews turn their
attention to one in Big Tujunga Canyon.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As firefighters smothered the last embers of the 1,500-acre Gorman
fire on Thursday in the Angeles National Forest, a new wildfire
spread rapidly in the Big Tujunga Canyon area of the forest.</LD>
<LD>   Aided by a stiff breeze, the second blaze grew quickly to 100
acres after being spotted at 4 p.m. near a U.S. Forest Service ranger
station on Big Tujunga Canyon Road.</LD>
<LD>   The remoteness of the area, about 15 miles northwest of Los
Angeles in rugged canyon country, made it difficult to get fire crews
there, but helicopters made water drops soon after the blaze broke
out, said U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Gail Wright.</LD>
<TE>   The causes of the fires were under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're up against is such incredibly dry fuel and hot
weather," Wright said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, firefighters had "a favorable day" controlling the Gorman
fire, about 50 miles northwest of Los Angeles, said Kathy Peterson of
the forest service.</TE>
<TE>   By Thursday evening, the Gorman fire was 90% contained, and crews
were mopping up hot spots. The cost of fighting the fire, which began
Tuesday afternoon, was estimated at $800,000 to $1.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   With several wildfires being fought around California and others
raging in the West, officials said firefighting crews are spread
thin.</TE>
<TE>   "We're drawn down so low, we have very few people left to send to
Big Tujunga Canyon," Wright said. "They're dispatching people from
anywhere around, whoever's not out on a fire."</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in California, the Bluecut fire in San Bernardino County
was 75% contained Thursday at 7,750 acres. About 1,000 firefighters
remained on the scene, and full containment is expected today at 6
p.m. The fire started near Interstate 15 on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Barbara County, the Sudden Ranch fire burning on
Vandenberg Air Force Base was 100% contained Thursday after consuming
7,782 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Further north, lightning strikes hindered firefighting efforts on
the Cannon fire near Yosemite National Park, which grew to 22,000
acres. Three firefighters were killed earlier this week fighting that
blaze when their air tanker crashed in a field near the town of
Walker.</TE>
<TE>   That fire, which began Saturday, was only 15% contained Thursday,
and parts of California 395 were still closed.</TE>

<HD>Bill Demands Executives Report Suspected Crimes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>In an effort to prevent future Enron-style financial scandals, the
Senate passed legislation Thursday that would require CEOs, directors
and other corporate executives to report a company's suspected
illegal activities or face fines of up to $100,000.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal, introduced in the aftermath of the collapse of the
Enron Corp. and the loss of millions in employee retirement funds,
also would create a special whistle-blower hotline at the office of
Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer.</LD>
<LD>   Supporters of the bill by Sen. Martha Escutia (D-Whittier) claimed
it would impose strict new standards of public responsibility on
players in the arena of big business. Opponents said it comes close
to Nazi tactics and threatens to turn California into a police state
full of "snitches" and "finks."</LD>
<TE>   The bill passed the Senate on a 21-15 vote, the bare margin
required to send it to the Assembly. Provisions imposing criminal
penalties against errant business executives were stripped from an
earlier version of the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   The bill is opposed by business organizations, and it faces an
uncertain future in the Assembly where business interests appear to
wield more influence among the majority Democrats than they do in the
Senate.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got our work cut out for us," acknowledged Doug Heller, a
senior lobbyist for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights,
the Santa Monica-based group that sponsored the bill.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman said Gov. Gray Davis, who is courting the support of
business and consumers as he campaigns for reelection, has no
position on the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Escutia told colleagues that the financial scandals of Enron and
other major companies such as Tyco and Adelphia demand that top
officers be held responsible for illegal actions that damage innocent
victims, including investors, employees, pensioners and the
marketplace itself.</TE>
<TE>   She said her legislation is aimed at preventing and abating future
corporate misconduct "before truly disastrous consequences happen."</TE>
<TE>   The bill would apply to corporate officers and directors of
publicly held companies, to members of limited liability companies
and to the financial managers of these enterprises.</TE>
<TE>   It would be against the law for such officers to fail to report to
the attorney general within 15 days any "actual knowledge" that
illegal actions had occurred that would portray a false value of the
company's soundness or that were intended to deceive government
regulators.</TE>
<TE>   At the highest executive level, violators would be subject to a
civil fine of up to $100,000 per offense, while financial managers
could be fined up to $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   Sens. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) and K. Maurice Johannessen
(R-Redding) denounced the bill as a threat to democratic freedoms.
Johannessen said it reminded him of Nazi tactics that led neighbors
to report on each other in his native Norway during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   "Be careful about this," he warned colleagues, "because you don't
know if your neighbor is watching you."</TE>
<TE>   Peace called the plan "frightening."</TE>
<TE>   He said he does not believe it is "necessary to sacrifice our
freedom and turn us all into snitches."</TE>

<HD>Turkey Takes the Helm of Peacekeeping Force in Kabul</HD>
<DH>Asia: Britain hands off command of the unit amid pomp and
circumstance and renewed calls for the mission to be expanded.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Under a scorching sun, Britain handed over command of the
multinational peacekeeping force here to Turkey on Thursday, the
first change of leadership since the troops arrived six months ago.</LD>
<LD>   The hand-over came at a particularly uncertain moment in the
country's new life. Afghanistan's transitional president, Hamid
Karzai, was chosen last week and key members of his Cabinet were just
approved Wednesday by a loya jirga, or grand council, of delegates
from around the nation.</LD>
<LD>   Karzai, who attended the ceremony on the grounds of a soccer
field, warmly praised the work of the International Security
Assistance Force, or ISAF, which he said has been crucial to creating
the secure environment that is necessary for the country to begin to
rebuild.</LD>
<TE>   "It is self-explanatory to the world and to us how important, how
good the work of ISAF has been and how vital the leadership of ISAF
has been," he said of the peacekeeping force, which has been deployed
in Kabul, the capital, but not in the outlying regions of
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The ceremony had an incongruous aura of pomp and circumstance
given the blazing heat and the generally tattered environment of
Afghanistan. It began with a Turkish marching band, clad in
impractically heavy, long red jackets and jaunty hats, followed by a
British band in neat camouflage uniform, playing pipes and drums.</TE>
<TE>   Mindful of Britain's role in Afghanistan more than a century ago,
when its army fought to subdue the Afghan people, outgoing commander
Maj. Gen. John McColl responded that he was glad that this time the
British had come to help Afghans rebuild.</TE>
<TE>   "Afghanistan has hosted British generals in previous centuries on
at least three occasions," McColl said. "Generally things haven't
gone too well for my predecessors. It has been an honor for the
United Kingdom to lead ISAF for the last six months, and I am
delighted things seem to have gone a little better this time."</TE>
<TE>   In London, Defense Minister Geoff Hoon said Thursday that the
British contingent with the ISAF would be reduced from 1,300 to about
400 troops by late summer.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai has been a strong supporter of ISAF's presence, pushing for
it even when many of the warlords of the ethnic Tajik-dominated
Northern Alliance, which helped to force the Taliban out of Kabul,
resisted the idea of allowing in foreign troops who might be a
challenge to their authority.</TE>
<TE>   As violence persists in other parts of the country, Karzai
repeatedly has requested that the peacekeepers expand their mission
beyond the capital. So far, he has been rebuffed by the United States
and countries that have contributed to the force. They have been
reluctant to commit additional soldiers and money to the difficult
job.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, a group of aid organizations renewed the call to
expand the peacekeeping operation at least to the region around the
northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif. Even as other areas of Afghanistan
have become more stable, the north has faced continuing violence over
the last few months, making it difficult for groups to deliver aid.</TE>
<TE>   "It is becoming almost impossible for many nongovernmental
organizations to work effectively in northern areas," said Ian
Purves, the executive director of the Agency Coordinating Body for
Afghan Relief, which represents many aid organizations. "Every time a
convoy with relief goods goes out, it risks being hijacked. Every
agency that brings in money for salaries or for running employment
[programs] risks being looted."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, a woman working with an international aid group was
repeatedly raped and her Afghan driver severely beaten.</TE>
<TE>   For the moment, the Turks will have their hands full retaining
control over Kabul, where as recently as Tuesday several rockets tore
over the city. Although no one was hurt, it was a reminder of the
availability of weapons and the continuing presence of people who are
hostile to both the new government and the international force.</TE>
<TE>   The Turks will command nearly 5,000 soldiers from 19 nations. The
country's contingent will increase to 1,400 by the end of the month,
making it the largest group in the international force. Germany has
the second-largest deployment, at 1,200 troops, and has leeway to add
200, according to an ISAF spokesman. The U.S. does not have troops in
the peacekeeping force.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey is expected to have the command for a six-month term that
could be extended.</TE>
<TE>   The peacekeepers do a variety of jobs, from training the new
Afghan police force to securing the airport and the international
troops' headquarters to running joint patrols with the police.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai said a key future role of the international force is to
help train an Afghan national guard. All armed forces should be under
the control of the nation's Defense Ministry, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is any armed force that is separate, we will treat them
as a renegade force," Karzai said. "We want warlordism to end in
Afghanistan by any means."</TE>
<TE>   Turkey is the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's only Muslim
member, and the Bush administration has been eager for the country to
play a visible role in the region to help show the Islamic world that
the coalition against terrorism is not anti-Muslim. The Turks were
reluctant to take on the job and agreed only after getting U.S.
guarantees of financial help and military support.</TE>
<TE>   At the hand-over ceremony, incoming Turkish commander Maj. Gen.
Akin Zorlu spoke enthusiastically about the takeover.</TE>
<TE>   "Turkey has willingly agreed to take over leadership with the aim
of contributing to the peace and security that the Afghan people have
long deserved," Zorlu said.</TE>
<TE>   "We shall do our best to enhance the peace and welfare of the
people of Kabul," he said, promising that the Turkish troops would
"treat everyone equally and fairly."</TE>

<HD>Immigration Bill Becomes German Law, Faces Attack</HD>
<DH>Europe: Conservative opposition says it will mount a
constitutional challenge to the statute, which eases entry for
skilled workers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>German President Johannes Rau signed into law Thursday an immigration
bill aimed at attracting high-tech experts to boost this country's
stagnant industrial sector. Conservative opponents immediately
announced that they will mount a constitutional challenge.</LD>
<LD>   The long-contemplated and much-revised immigration law had been
languishing on Rau's desk since March 22, when it squeaked by the
upper house of Parliament in a close and controversial vote. Rau
spent the last three months seeking legal advice on the bill's
constitutionality--and deciding the proper moment to make his call on
legislation that promises to infuse more strife into the current
federal election campaign.</LD>
<LD>   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, his Social Democratic Party and the
Greens, partners in the ruling coalition, have hailed the immigration
law as a major achievement of their four-year term in government.
However, the notion of opening the door wider to foreigners and
seeking to better integrate those already here has been seized upon
by the conservative Christian Democratic Union, or CDU, as purported
evidence that the current leadership is endangering German jobs.</LD>
<TE>   The bill has the support of German employers, the conservatives'
political allies in the pro-business Free Democratic Party and even
some prominent members of the CDU. But Schroeder's challenger for the
chancellery, Bavarian Gov. Edmund Stoiber, has cast the measure as a
threat to the economy, which is already suffering about 10%
unemployment.</TE>
<TE>   Despite statistical and anecdotal evidence to the contrary,
Stoiber's claims that the policies on immigration contained in the
bill will undermine the troubled economy have been gaining the ear of
disgruntled German voters. The Bavarian now enjoys as much as a 7
percentage point lead over Schroeder and the Social Democrats with
just three months to go before the Sept. 22 election.</TE>
<TE>   No sooner had Rau signed the law than the conservative governors
of three states--Hesse, Bavaria and Thuringia--announced that they
would call for a Constitutional Court review of its approval by the
Bundesrat, or upper house of Parliament. That 35-34 vote has been
denounced by the conservatives as illegal because one of the four
members for the state of Brandenburg, which is governed by a
coalition of Social Democrats and the CDU, sought unsuccessfully to
cast his vote against the bill. The constitution requires unanimous
votes from each state or abstention, and all four votes from
Brandenburg were counted as yes.</TE>
<TE>   The legal challenge could take many months to resolve. Although
the Constitutional Court is supposed to be above partisan politics,
it is unlikely to issue a decision before the election for fear of
being accused of bias.</TE>
<TE>   That legal limbo leaves the issue ripe for political harvest, but
the CDU has mixed experience with playing the anti-immigrant card.
The party has been accused of pandering to racist hostility with its
claims that immigrants are a threat to prosperity and security, and
the Free Democrats already are embroiled in a controversy about
remarks made by a senior member that have been denounced by Jewish
leaders as anti-Semitic.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Stoiber and his allies have shown themselves ready to run
with the anti-immigrant issue, most recently at their annual party
congress in Frankfurt earlier this week when they vowed to repeal the
changes if they are elected.</TE>
<TE>   The immigration law, which would take effect Jan. 1 if cleared of
the constitutional challenge, is the product of years of negotiation
among politicians, employers, churches and social groups within the
federal Independent Commission on Immigration, headed by former
parliamentary President Rita Suessmuth.</TE>
<TE>   A prominent CDU member, Suessmuth has described Stoiber's views on
the bill as "problematic" because they ignore the need for tens of
thousands of workers the commission estimates should be allowed to
immigrate to make up for Germany's aging and shrinking population.</TE>
<TE>   The law consolidates decades of ad hoc legislation into a single
code aimed at easing visa and residency permit procedures for those
who could bring in needed abilities and entrepreneurial skills. It
also provides for German language instruction for foreign residents
who fail a proficiency test--assistance long sought by all leading
political factions to better integrate the 7.3 million non-Germans
already living in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Although more than 4 million German workers are jobless, the
country still suffers a dearth of at least 75,000 workers trained in
computers and technology. Most of the unemployed here reside in
eastern states where Communist-era heavy industries that were not
competitive have shut down. Those from western states also tend to
come from the manufacturing sector, where robotics and technological
improvements have led to massive downsizing of the labor force.</TE>
<TE>   Rau, a longtime member of Schroeder's Social Democrats although
now in the nonpartisan role of president, said he had "examined very
carefully whether the immigration law conforms with the
constitution." He also expressed regret that the politicians couldn't
come to an amicable agreement without resorting to the court.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder hailed Rau's decision to sign the bill and said he was
neither angered by nor worried about the constitutional challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the opposition's right to file claims as often as it
considers appropriate," the chancellor told journalists. "We'll just
have to wait and see what the Constitutional Court has to say."</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference to discuss the law's implications, Interior
Minister Otto Schily said the number of newcomers likely to take
advantage of the legislation was not the issue. If anything, he said,
the number of immigrants will decrease but the quality of their job
skills will improve significantly.</TE>
<TE>   "Numbers are not the issue," he said. "There are more Germans in
Spain than there are Spaniards in Germany, probably because the sun
shines there more often."</TE>

<HD>Westerners on Alert After Saudi Car Bomb Kills Briton</HD>
<DH>Mideast: It is unclear whether the blast is linked to
terrorism or liquor smuggling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>A car bomb killed a British banker in Saudi Arabia on Thursday
morning, adding to concerns that Westerners living in the oil-rich
desert kingdom might be targets for violence, a threat the government
has tried to downplay.</LD>
<LD>   Simon Veness, 35, a financial risk manager and father of a
1-year-old, died almost instantly. His Land Rover was parked just
outside a walled residential compound in northern Riyadh, the
capital, and witnesses said it appeared the bomb was located beneath
the driver's seat.</LD>
<LD>   Two days earlier, Saudi officials announced that they had broken
up a terrorist ring linked to Al Qaeda and operating inside the
country.</LD>
<TE>   The terrorists had planned to use rockets and explosives against
American targets, Saudi officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Though police said that they were uncertain of the motive for
Thursday's bombing, and no one had taken responsibility, the British
Embassy issued a warning to its citizens living and working in the
kingdom.</TE>
<TE>   "This provides a good opportunity to remind you once again of the
current advice that British nationals should maintain sensible
security precautions and vigilance," the embassy said on its Web
site.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Sept. 11 attacks on the U.S.--15 of the hijackers were
Saudi citizens--the kingdom's leadership had bristled at the
suggestion that Saudi Arabia's strict religious doctrine had bred
extremism, and it insisted that Al Qaeda was not operating in its
territory.</TE>
<TE>   So its announcement this week that the authorities had arrested
seven would-be terrorists and six alleged accomplices marked a
significant concession by the regime.</TE>
<TE>   But there was never any suggestion that the Saudi system was
culpable.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, government statements emphasized that the terrorists'
plans ran counter to Islam.</TE>
<TE>   Then came Thursday's car bombing.</TE>
<TE>   Police in Riyadh said that the case was under investigation and
that details and the motive were unknown. But even before the
blasted-out vehicle was removed from the scene, unnamed sources were
suggesting that the blast was linked to another scourge plaguing the
kingdom: the "Liquor Mafia."</TE>
<TE>   The Arab News, an English-language newspaper based in the port
city of Jidda, reported that "a Saudi official told Arab News last
night: 'It looks as though this incident is related to previous
bombings involving British expatriates illegally smuggling in and
selling alcohol. However, we are not ruling out any possibility at
this early stage.' "</TE>
<TE>   Abubakr Bagader, a professor of sociology at King Abdulaziz
University in Jidda, said in a telephone interview: "The official
line is that this is linked with the mafia, mainly Europeans, who
smuggle alcohol into Saudi Arabia. There is always competition
between these gangs. They are always territorial."</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia, which is the location of Islam's two holiest sites,
is governed according to a strict interpretation of Islam. Alcohol
consumption is forbidden.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the kingdom's efforts to present itself as a purely
Islamic nation, there is a vibrant black market for liquor.</TE>
<TE>   The statements from the unnamed sources might suggest that the
kingdom's authorities, faced with having people wonder whether
terrorism or illegal booze was behind the car bombing, saw the latter
as the lesser of two embarrassments.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the liquor theory is without merit.</TE>
<TE>   "There is liquor dealing," said James Kashoggi, an expert in
Islamic extremism and deputy editor of the Arab News, who agreed with
that explanation for the bombing. "Someone does the smuggling,
someone does the distribution and someone else does the financing. It
is a huge business."</TE>
<TE>   Kashoggi said the bombing had all the markings of previous attacks
tied to liquor smuggling.</TE>
<TE>   There were three bombings in the kingdom in late 2000, in which
one Briton was killed and another was seriously wounded.</TE>
<TE>   In March 2001, a Briton and an Egyptian were injured in a bombing
outside a large downtown Riyadh bookstore, and two months later an
American was seriously injured in Khobar when a package he was
opening exploded.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi officials attributed all those blasts to disputes between
gangs smuggling alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   Five Britons, a Canadian and a Belgian are in prison awaiting
trial.</TE>
<TE>   However, friends of Veness expressed doubt Thursday that the
banker, an employee of Al Bank al Saudi al Fransi, had any
involvement with gangs.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not possible," one friend, who requested that his name not
be used, told Reuters news service.</TE>
<TE>   "Simon was a highly respected banker. Simon was set to return to
London in the first week of July to pursue his career after working
in Saudi Arabia for almost four years," he said.</TE>

<LD>   The Swedish-built Viggen, or "Thunderbolt," swept close to a group

Uppsala, 40 miles north of Stockholm. All but one of the visitors
were burned by the exhaust and some were thrown to the ground,
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   An air force spokesman said the group was about 50 yards from the

<HD>Gunmen Burst Into Home, Kill 5 Israeli Settlers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS and TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Five Jewish settlers, including a woman and three of her children,
were killed Thursday night after Palestinian gunmen burst into a
home, took hostages and fought a gun battle with Israeli troops. The
attack came as the army widened its operations throughout the West
Bank.</LD>
<LD>   At least one Palestinian assailant was also killed in the raid on
the Itamar settlement near the West Bank city of Nablus north of
here. Eight Israelis were wounded, including another child.</LD>
<LD>   Before dawn today, Israeli troops and armor moved into Nablus and
began taking Palestinian prisoners. It was the latest incursion as
the army fulfilled new orders to seize Palestinian territory
following a wave of suicide bombings. Hundreds of Palestinians have
been arrested and homes searched in four other West Bank cities and
several villages.</LD>
<TE>   Israel issued a limited call-up of reservists ahead of what is
expected to be a protracted military campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon cut short a public appearance
Thursday night when he learned of the Itamar attack, which came on
the heels of two suicide bombings that killed 26 Israelis in 36
hours. An emergency Cabinet meeting was called for today.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon spoke to President Bush briefly by telephone, the
conversation largely focused on the current round of attacks against
Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second infiltration in three weeks into Itamar, home to
some of Israel's most militant settlers. On May 28, three teenage
settlers were killed by a Palestinian gunman on a basketball court in
the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   In Thursday night's attack, the gunmen rushed into the unfenced
settlement and opened fire as they ran into a house, witnesses said.
Inside, they apparently shot to death a woman identified as Rachel
Shabo and three of her children, ages 16, 12 and 5, Israeli state
radio reported. A neighbor who rushed to help was also killed. Other
children in the large family reportedly saved themselves by hiding in
bedrooms and the bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers who converged on the house shot it out with the
Palestinians in a gun battle that lasted nearly two hours. One of the
Palestinians was killed, the army said. A second body believed to be
that of the other Palestinian was found in the ruins of the house, a
portion of which caught fire and burned.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard gunfire and felt that this was something more than
target practice," settler Yaakov Heiman told Israeli television. "We
heard shouting that a terrorist had entered the settlement.... It is
just awful."</TE>
<TE>   Two Palestinian groups claimed responsibility for the attack. One
is an armed offshoot of the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, whose leader was assassinated by Israel last year. The
other is the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, which is affiliated with
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat on Thursday urged an end to attacks on Israeli civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Many Palestinians distinguish between attacks inside Israel and
those that target settlers and soldiers in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, land captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War that
Palestinians claim.</TE>
<TE>   Anticipating another Israeli military offensive following a spate
of deadly suicide bombings, Palestinians on Thursday voiced both
dread and defiance.</TE>
<TE>   In Bethlehem, Kalkilya, Jenin, Tulkarm and many villages, tens of
thousands of Palestinians were confined to their homes by military
curfews that the Israeli army said would last "until the missions are
completed." In Jenin, more than 2,000 men were rounded up overnight,
although most were released by morning. Troops conducted
house-to-house searches in many communities as security officials
warned that more suicide bombers were heading for Israeli cities.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli forces met with little resistance. Palestinian police and
other security officers disappeared from their posts and militants
went into hiding. None of the armed men who are usually a common
sight on the streets here in Ramallah could be seen Thursday. It was
a city visibly hunkering down for the anticipated invasion.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians seemed to sense that this time, Israeli fury is so
great that the government may soon unleash a military operation that
could dwarf Operation Defensive Shield. That offensive, launched in
March after a bomber killed 29 Israelis attending a Passover dinner,
was the largest military sweep through the West Bank since the Middle
East War.</TE>
<TE>   The back-to-back suicide attacks in Jerusalem this week have
triggered a chorus of calls for the government to take harsh action.</TE>
<TE>   The Itamar raid was sure to solidify Sharon's resolve.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in the middle of a war," he told a conference in Tel Aviv
on Thursday night, after being notified of the violence in Itamar. "A
hard war, a cruel war that Palestinian terrorists are carrying out
against old people, women and children."</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli daily Maariv said in an editorial Thursday that the
army "must embark on Operation Defensive Shield 2." Beneath pictures
of an injured Israeli infant being carried into a hospital after
Wednesday's bombing and mourners weeping at the funeral of someone
killed in Tuesday's bombing, the newspaper said that this time, the
operation should be conducted "without restrictions, without
concessions, throughout Judea and Samaria [the West Bank], in all of
the Gaza Strip."</TE>
<TE>   In an anguished front-page column in the same newspaper, Editor in
Chief Amnon Dankner raged at Palestinians that "you are a
suicidal-terrorist society."</TE>
<TE>   From now on, he said, "when we have to protect ourselves from you
by means of action, on behalf of what morality will anyone be able to
complain to us if we watch out for ourselves and are less and less
heedful of treading on your human dignity and the dignity of your
lives, which you yourself have been obliterating for so long?"</TE>
<TE>   In Ramallah, residents awakened Thursday morning to the news that
troops and tanks had rolled into neighboring Beitunia, to the west,
and were conducting house-to-house searches there after imposing a
curfew.</TE>
<TE>   People waited to see whether the tanks would continue into
Ramallah, then began opening shops and businesses at midmorning when
it seemed they had stopped in Beitunia. But few believed the reprieve
would last long.</TE>
<TE>   "I figure the troops will get here tomorrow or the next day," said
Abbas abu Dahab, owner of the My Name clothing boutique in Ramallah.
Abu Dahab, 53, visited the Al Quds bakery next to his store to buy a
bag of sesame rolls "so I can have something to eat if I'm wrong and
I get trapped in the shop."</TE>
<TE>   In Beitunia, Adnan Mahmoud, a 45-year-old teacher, defied the
military curfew to get his daughter, 18-year-old Randa, to her
matriculation exams.</TE>
<TE>   The pair hurried on foot past shuttered shops, down the village's
abandoned main street, prepared to trek at least a mile to Al Birah,
where Randa was scheduled to take the comprehensive exams every
Palestinian student must pass to receive a high school diploma.</TE>
<TE>   "We were afraid to leave the house, because we heard shooting
earlier and we were not sure what was going on," Adnan Mahmoud said.</TE>
<TE>   "But we had to leave, because my daughter had to sit for her
exams. So we overcame our fears," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Behind them an Israeli tank blocked the main road.</TE>
<TE>   As Israelis buried more dead Thursday, including a woman and her
5-year-old granddaughter, debate intensified within the government
over its new policy. Announced Wednesday, it calls for reoccupying
stretches of Palestinian-controlled territory after every attack.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer insisted that the policy
does not mean full reoccupation of the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   He said the military incursions are for security reasons only and
would last only two or three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   But Palestinians said they believed that Sharon means to reoccupy
the West Bank and destroy whatever remains of the 1993 Oslo peace
accords.</TE>
<TE>   Yasser Abed-Rabbo, the Palestinian Authority minister of culture
and information, said, "Sharon wants to create a new status quo,
where all the world, including the Americans, will talk only about
his withdrawal from Area A," the 40% of the West Bank under
Palestinian control, and not whether Sharon is prepared to restart
negotiations aimed at ending the bloodshed and reaching an agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat, speaking to reporters Thursday outside the ruins of his
headquarters in Ramallah, said he condemned "these terrorist attacks
against civilians, Israelis and Palestinians." A statement from
Arafat calling for an immediate halt to shootings and bombings was
published Thursday in Palestinian newspapers, but Arafat canceled a
television appearance planned to make the same plea.</TE>
<TE>   The two main militant Islamic groups, Hamas and Islamic Jihad,
responsible for many of the suicide bombings, rejected Arafat's
appeal, defending their attacks as legitimate resistance to Israeli
occupation and vowing to continue them.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, meanwhile, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell
called the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Russia
and Britain and the European Union's foreign policy chief to brief
them on a U.S. peace proposal that Bush had been expected to announce
this week. Powell did not get into specifics of Bush's planned
speech, according to one of the foreign ministers he called, who
requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush address, which is expected to call for creation of a
provisional Palestinian state, was delayed following the most recent
suicide bombings and now is not likely to occur before next week.</TE>

<HD>Philippine Troops Kill Rebel Leader</HD>
<DH>Asia: Abu Sabaya, head of gang that abducted U.S.
missionaries, dies in gun battle, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK and AL JACINTO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines</DL>
<LD>The leader of the Abu Sayyaf gang that held two American missionaries
hostage for more than a year was killed early today by Philippine
navy SEALs as he tried to escape by boat from Mindanao island,
military officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Abu Sabaya, known for his taunting remarks and trademark
sunglasses, died in a gunfight on the water after he and six other
rebels opened fire on a navy vessel that tried to halt their
speedboat, said Col. Juancho Saban, deputy commander of the marines
in the southern Philippines.</LD>
<LD>   "He tried to fight off government soldiers at sea and he was
peppered with bullets," Saban said. "We are 100% sure that Sabaya is
dead. This is a serious setback for the Abu Sayyaf."</LD>
<TE>   The Philippine government has made it a high priority to crush the
Abu Sayyaf rebels, believed by the U.S. to have links to Osama Bin
Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist group.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,000 U.S. troops have been deployed in the southern
Philippines to train Philippine fighters and assist with surveillance
and communications. Officials said U.S. troops were not involved in
today's firefight.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, the Philippine military reported on one occasion that
Sabaya was wounded and on another that he was ill and needed kidney
dialysis. Neither turned out to be true.</TE>
<TE>   Sabaya's death is perhaps the biggest victory against the group
since its original leader, Abdurajak Abubakar Janjalani, was killed
by police in 1998. Hundreds of Abu Sayyaf rebels continue to operate
on three islands in the region.</TE>
<TE>   The brutal Abu Sayyaf gang advocates the formation of an Islamic
state in the southern Philippines but supports itself primarily
through kidnapping for ransom. It had links to Bin Laden in the
mid-1990s, but it is unclear if any connection remains.</TE>
<TE>   In Manila, Defense Secretary Gen. Angelo Reyes said that four
rebels were captured during the battle but that he would not confirm
that Sabaya was killed until he had seen the body.</TE>
<TE>   Saban said the navy vessel encountered the rebel speedboat at 4:20
a.m. off Mindanao near the town of Sibuco. The SEALs ordered the boat
to halt, and the gang members opened fire with automatic weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The SEALs returned fire, sinking the boat and forcing the rebels
into the water, Saban said. Sabaya continued firing and was shot
dead, he said. Four of the rebels were captured and three were
killed, the colonel said, including Sabaya.</TE>
<TE>   Sabaya, one of many Abu Sayyaf commanders, became notorious after
the kidnapping of 20 people from a resort on the island of Palawan in
May 2001. Among them were missionaries Martin and Gracia Burnham of
Kansas, and Guillermo Sobero of Corona, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the kidnapping, Sabaya announced that he would behead
Sobero as a birthday present to Philippine President Gloria Macapagal
Arroyo. Sobero's body was found weeks later.</TE>
<TE>   Sabaya appeared to enjoy calling radio stations in the southern
Philippines by satellite phone to taunt the president.</TE>
<TE>   After she promised to crush the Abu Sayyaf, he responded in one
call: "Old lady Gloria, what was it you said? 'I will crush you'?
Well, here I am. I am not crushed."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Philippine commandos tracking the rebels with
their hostages found them in the jungle and opened fire. Two of the
hostages, Martin Burnham and Philippine nurse Deborah Yap, were
killed. Gracia Burnham was shot in the leg but rescued.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, the military said it had recovered Sabaya's broken
sunglasses and his backpack. They predicted it was only a matter of
time before they tracked him down.</TE>
<TE>   Maj. Richard Sater, spokesman for U.S. forces in the southern
Philippines, welcomed the news that Sabaya was dead.</TE>
<TE>   "I got the report from the Philippine military and it certainly is
good news on the U.S.-led fight against terrorism," Sater said.</TE>
<TE>   He said no U.S. troops were directly involved in the clash but
that he could not comment on whether the U.S. assisted in finding or
tracking the rebel boat.</TE>

<HD>Bush Seeks to Double, to $200 Million, Educational Aid to
Africa</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The White House said Thursday that President Bush wants to double the
funding, to $200 million over five years, for a program to improve
basic education and teacher training in Africa.</LD>
<LD>   The statement was his second on Africa in as many days and came as
the White House also announced that Bush next year will make his
first visit to the continent as president.</LD>
<LD>   The additional education funding, if approved by Congress, would
allow the training of more than 420,000 new teachers and provide
250,000 scholarships for girls. The money would also enable the
federal government to join with historically black colleges and
universities in the U.S. to provide 4.5 million more textbooks to
schoolchildren in Africa, according to the White House.</LD>
<TE>   Bush previously visited Egypt as part of a delegation of governors
and Gambia as a member of a U.S. delegation during his father's
presidency. The White House did not say when Bush would make the trip
or what countries he would visit.</TE>
<TE>   Bush was to discuss his proposal at a Thursday night dinner here
honoring the late Rev. Leon H. Sullivan, a Philadelphia minister who
worked to end apartheid in South Africa and to improve overall
relations between the United States and the continent.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Bush pledged to seek an additional $300 million to
help nations in Africa and the Caribbean protect infants from the
human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS. About 2,000 newborns
are infected with the virus every day. The program now is funded at
$200 million.</TE>
<TE>   Both presidential pledges seem intended to soften, if not entirely
preempt, criticism Bush might encounter at a summit next week in
Canada of the Group of 8 leading industrialized nations, during which
assistance to Africa is expected to be a prime focus.</TE>
<TE>   Although Bush's dual commitments drew praise from some AIDS and
education activists, others criticized both initiatives as falling
short.</TE>
<TE>   The United States is frequently taken to task for being stingy
when it comes to foreign aid. The nation's $10-billion annual
international assistance budget is the lowest among wealthy nations
as a percentage of economic output, critics point out.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Bush proposed a 50% increase in the U.S. foreign aid
budget over three years, targeted at developing nations that commit
themselves to free trade, political liberty and human rights.</TE>

<HD>Democrats, GOP Skeptical of Bush Mideast Peace Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As the Bush administration continues debating a proposal to create a
provisional Palestinian state, signs are mounting that the idea could
face a rocky domestic reception.</LD>
<LD>   While some experts on peace negotiating in the region--such as
former President Clinton and his chief Middle East envoy, Dennis B.
Ross--have praised the notion, initial reactions from others indicate
that the idea could face a cross-fire of resistance from Republicans
and Democrats.</LD>
<LD>   Even before Bush finalizes his proposal, conservatives are
charging that the president would be rewarding terrorism if he
endorses a provisional Palestinian state in the wake of the latest
suicide bombings against Israelis. "It gives momentum to the
terrorists by allowing them to say we got this [recognition] by doing
things our way," said Gary J. Schmitt, executive director of the
Project for a New American Century, a conservative foreign policy
think tank.</LD>
<TE>   Democratic officials and analysts worry that the idea doesn't
directly address enough Israeli or Palestinian concerns to change the
behavior of either side in the conflict--especially because Bush
previously has indicated that he would support a permanent state for
the Palestinians if they stop terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "I just fail to see how [the idea] moves anything anywhere," Rep.
Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), the House minority leader, said in an
interview.</TE>
<TE>   White House officials have expressed some frustration at such
remarks, arguing that the final proposal will address many critics'
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   But the skeptical responses suggest that Bush is still caught
between Arab pressure for steps to provide Palestinians greater hope
of a political solution and an American leadership hostile toward any
measures that seem to reward violence or legitimize Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat. The latest violence is
complicating Bush's position by heightening resistance to any
increased Palestinian autonomy--not only among Israelis but also
among Israel's supporters in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how you create a state out of chaos in a place where
terrorists are running the show," Gephardt said.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said on CNN this week: "How
in the world could you enhance [Arafat's] status and that of the
Palestinians to statehood, unless [the violence] stops?"</TE>
<TE>   Beyond increased sensitivity to Palestinian terrorism after Sept.
11, political currents in both parties are creating pressures that
could reduce congressional enthusiasm for Bush's eventual initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Conservative Christians, a key GOP constituency, have grown more
resistant to any moves they perceive as constraining Israel or
rewarding the Palestinians. Meanwhile, concern that Bush's generally
strong support of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon might open
inroads for the president among American Jews is increasing pressure
on Democrats to move to Bush's right on the issue, party insiders
say.</TE>
<TE>   "Whereas a couple of years ago, for the American Jewish community
Israel was diminishing as an issue, it has reasserted itself at the
top of the agenda," said a lobbyist for a leading Jewish group. "I
think that it makes sense for the Democrats to not allow themselves
to get outflanked on this [by Bush]."</TE>
<TE>   The president was expected to announce his plan earlier this week.
But he has delayed it, both because of the renewed violence in Israel
and continued disagreements inside the administration over his plan's
details. Senior officials told The Times that after the latest
attacks, Bush has become especially determined to avoid "doing
anything that can possibly be interpreted as a reward for the
Palestinians' behavior."</TE>
<TE>   Still, close administration observers expect the plan, when
finally released, to call for the creation of a provisional
Palestinian state with temporary borders--once the Palestinian
Authority has undertaken sweeping reforms and moved to stop terrorist
attacks on Israel. Under the proposal, negotiations would be deferred
on the underlying issues--such as permanent borders and the right of
return for Palestinian refugees--that derailed the search for a final
Israeli-Palestinian agreement during the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   The idea's supporters believe it might spark renewed progress at a
time when the two sides are too bloodied and embittered to reach a
permanent agreement.</TE>
<TE>   In a speech Monday to the Council on Foreign Relations in New
York, Clinton said a provisional state could help break the stalemate
if it is tied to Arab recognition of Israel and a clear timeline for
resolving the remaining issues necessary for a final agreement.</TE>
<TE>   In effect, he said, this approach would lay out the ultimate
benefits to both sides and "fill in the blanks over a specified
period of time."</TE>
<TE>   That may be the most the United States can accomplish at a moment
when tensions are so high, Clinton argued. "I just think it's going
to be hard to do more than that, because of the lack of trust and the
political differences among the parties," he said.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, skeptics believe that a provisional state would do at
once too much and too little to change the violent dynamic in the
region.</TE>
<TE>   It would do too much in the sense that some critics argue that a
call for such a state--even if tied to significant internal
reform--could be seen as a victory for Palestinian suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   And it would do too little in the sense that offering a
provisional state might not significantly change the incentives for
Israelis and Palestinians or clarify the underlying issues in their
dispute. "It doesn't answer Israel's security concerns and it doesn't
answer Palestinian statehood aspirations, so it's hard to see exactly
what it does," said Will Marshall, president of the Progressive
Policy Institute, a centrist Democratic think tank.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall and other critics note that because Bush has already
indicated that he would support a permanent Palestinian state that
controlled terrorism, it's not clear that the promise of a
provisional state somewhere along the way would create much more
incentive to crack down.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea that the Palestinians need a goal that is obtainable
simply doesn't wash," Schmitt said. "The Palestinians ... know darn
well at the end of the day if they cool the terrorism and create some
semblance of a peaceful regime ... they will have a state pretty
soon."</TE>
<TE>   Ivo H. Daalder, a former Clinton national security aide, argued
that the lengthy negotiation the administration appears to
envision--even with the promise of a provisional state along the
way--is unlikely to provide sufficient inducement for reform by the
Palestinian Authority or a crackdown on terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you have to leapfrog this interim and step-by-step
approach," he said.</TE>

<HD>Commercial Rockfishing Banned Off California</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FOSTER CITY, Calif.</DL>
<LD>In an emergency action, federal officials Thursday ordered a halt to
commercial fishing off much of the California coast beginning July 1
for varieties of rockfish commonly sold as red snapper, including one
type so overfished it may take 90 years to recover.</LD>
<LD>   The Pacific Fishery Management Council also requested that
California officials extend the ban to recreational fishermen as soon
as possible--which probably means early July.</LD>
<LD>   The emergency actions are just the beginning of what federal
officials are proposing as an indefinite closure of the continental
shelf off California, Oregon and Washington to bottom fishing
starting in January. The shelf encompasses the relatively shallow
areas that extend as far as 40 miles from shore and that are home to
83 types of bottom-dwelling rockfish and related species.</LD>
<TE>   "We're essentially making the shelf off California into one giant
marine reserve," said L.B. Boydstun, a state Department of Fish and
Game official who sits on the fisheries council. "We had hoped to
wait until January, but it was clear we had to act now."</TE>
<TE>   The impending closures could put hundreds of bottom trawlers and
long-line fishermen out of business and deal a heavy blow to charter
sportfishing fleets.</TE>
<TE>   California's annual commercial fishing harvest is valued at about
$550 million, the fifth-largest in the nation, according to the state
Department of Fish and Game.</TE>
<TE>   Recreational fishing adds $246 million, the council reported,
although recreational fishermen say their contribution to the state's
economy is much higher. The rockfish catch accounts for about 20% of
the overall commercial harvest.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials pointed out that there are other fish
populations that will remain untouched by the new rules. Most of
California's most profitable catches--squid, crab, sea urchin,
swordfish, tuna, sardines and anchovies--are not likely to be
affected by the closures.</TE>
<TE>   Fishermen were nonetheless stunned by the ban, which follows years
of little or no government intervention to halt the steady decline in
rockfish.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had 30 years of no management, and suddenly to have these
draconian changes is awful," said Fred Benko, a longtime Santa
Barbara fishermen and whale-watching boat captain. "To throw all
these guys out of work is going to decimate local communities like
Crescent City, Morro Bay, Bodega Bay and Eureka."</TE>
<TE>   Behind the sweeping action is a reluctant realization that the
vast ocean has limits and cannot, as was long believed, provide an
inexhaustible supply of fish.</TE>
<TE>   That concern was underscored in the latest population estimates
showing that rockfish numbers continue to plummet despite existing
catch limits and other attempts to rein in excessive harvests.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said tough federal laws and a series of courtroom
victories by environmentalists forced them to take bold steps to stop
the fish from being pushed toward extinction.</TE>
<TE>   Of 16 types of rockfish fully assessed, biologists determined that
nine suffer from excessive harvesting.</TE>
<TE>   The population of one rockfish species called bocaccio, once a
staple of fish markets in Southern and Central California, has
plummeted by 95%. Its numbers have fallen so low that the National
Marine Fisheries Service is considering adding bocaccio to the
endangered species list.</TE>
<TE>   Even if all fishing of bocaccio is halted, including those caught
accidentally, biologists predict it will take 90 years or more for
the species to recover.</TE>
<TE>   The Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996 requires federal officials
to take measures deemed necessary for fish populations to recover,
prompting the California closure.</TE>
<TE>   North of Cape Mendocino, the fisheries council enacted a more
modest emergency closure on Thursday to protect the darkblotched
rockfish, which favors deeper waters just beyond the continental
shelf.</TE>
<TE>   The broader closures proposed for next year are meant to cover the
waters off Northern California, Oregon and Washington to protect the
canary and yelloweye rockfish. Those species have been depleted to 8%
of their former abundance.</TE>
<TE>   Although scientists continue to work the numbers, their best
estimates are that it will take 55 years for the canary rockfish
numbers to rebound and up to 208 years for yelloweye.</TE>
<TE>   The fate of the West Coast rockfish, declared a federal "disaster"
two years ago, has many parallels to the collapse of New England's
famous cod population.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, federal officials were forced to step in and close 6,000
square miles of Georges Bank, once one of the world's richest fishing
grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the New England closure is small compared to what is unfolding
along the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   With all of the proposed closures, the Pacific Fishery Management
Council is moving toward shutting down about 20,000 square miles off
the West Coast. Final action on that ban is set for September. All
council decisions must be ratified by the National Marine Fisheries
Service, a legal step that has become pro forma.</TE>
<TE>   Fishermen, who have been focused on battling state proposals for a
490-square-mile marine reserve around the Santa Barbara Channel
Islands, were shellshocked by the scope of the council's proposals.</TE>
<TE>   They fought back with familiar arguments Thursday, questioning the
credibility of the fish population estimates. Many fishermen said
they see plenty of bocaccio, as many as they've seen in years. Others
concede that they rarely see or catch bocaccio but say that, when
they do, they are careful to throw them back.</TE>
<TE>   The vast majority of fishermen have argued for a narrowing of the
closure to areas deeper than 120 feet, instead of 60 feet, as
initially proposed. The extra depth widens the area open to bottom
fishing.</TE>
<TE>   "There are 25 sportfishing boats in the Channel Islands area, and
90% are going to be pushed out of business," said John Fuqua of
Cisco's Sportfishing in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   Fuqua and others who manage charter boats for recreational
fishermen may be able to eke out a living if permitted to fish as
deep as 120 feet, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The council initially picked 60 feet as the limit because
biologists have found that bocaccio pulled from deeper water and
thrown back have far less chance of survival.</TE>
<TE>   Bocaccio, like many other rockfish, have air-filled swim bladders
that expand when raised from crushing pressures of the deep, either
killing them or making it impossible for them to swim back down.</TE>
<TE>   Rockfish are particularly long-living fish that spawn relatively
late in life. Bocaccio can live to be 50 years old, and don't begin
to reproduce until they are 5. As they grow older and larger, the
females produce far more eggs. But too many are caught before they
reach reproductive age.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, conditions need to be just right--with cold,
plankton-rich waters--for bocaccio to have a successful spawning
year. That tends to happen only about once a decade, said UC Santa
Barbara rockfish expert Milton Love. The last time was in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Most bocaccio are now caught by recreational fishermen, federal
and state officials said. Rockfish have become a favorite standby of
charter and private fishing boats when the "glamour fish" such as
salmon, albacore or barracuda are not biting.</TE>
<TE>   Economists who study the fishing industry understand there will be
an economic toll. Precisely what that will be is far from certain.
Many of the 1,200 to 1,800 commercial fishing boats in California,
Oregon and Washington that go after rockfish and cod will have to
seek out other fish or go out of business.</TE>
<TE>   Yet economists contend that the closures may only hasten the
inevitable. Every month, more of these fishermen go bankrupt, failing
to balance income from ever-shrinking catches with payments on their
boats.</TE>

<HD>Students Reach for High Note</HD>
<DH>A dedicated teacher, a nurturing community and a passion
for music propel a Santa Monica school symphony to the stage at
Carnegie Hall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTHA GROVES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Nonchalance is not an option when making your Carnegie Hall debut.
Just ask 15-year-old Sarah Crespo-Szabo.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm so nervous my hands are shaking," the percussionist
confides to a cellist moments before the Santa Monica High School Symphony
walks onstage.</LD>
<LD>   Crespo-Szabo and her 78 orchestra mates had spent months preparing
for this moment, and, typical teenagers, many wanted to seem blase.
But now, as they are about to play music by Tchaikovsky in the hall
where he had conducted 111 years earlier, palms grow clammy, mouths
go dry, bellies churn.</LD>
<TE>   As the musicians troop out to the stage's glare, the first-chair
trumpet, who had been sick in bed during that morning's Carnegie
run-through, gets his first peek at the towering tiers of loges and
the creamy, gold-bedecked walls. Wide-eyed, he utters, "Whoa!"</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere between "Mr. Holland's Opus" and "Music of the Heart"
lies the tale of how the Santa Monica High School Symphony played
Carnegie Hall.</TE>
<TE>   This is not, like that first Hollywood weeper, a story about a
music teacher postponing the opus of a lifetime to devote himself to
his students. Nor is it, like the other, a saga of underprivileged
youngsters defying the odds to land on the music world's
quintessential stage.</TE>
<TE>   But two elements of those films run like leitmotifs through this
account: the ability of a committed mentor to push kids to new
heights, and the power of a caring community to provide the lift.</TE>
<TE>   And then, of course, there was the force of the music itself.</TE>
<TE>   After the musicians take their seats, the blond
concertmaster--looking like the West Coast surfer he is--steps onto
the podium and cues the principal oboist for an "A." He matches that
"A" with his violin and the strings and winds join in, the rich sound
swelling.</TE>
<TE>   Conductor Christopher Schwabe strides onstage and, beaming,
acknowledges the audience's applause. He turns to face his charges,
appearing older than their years in their black-and-white concert
wear.</TE>
<TE>   As Crespo-Szabo steadies her sticks above the snare drum, Schwabe
raises his baton but hesitates. He knows that the first note will set
the tone. Are they ready?</TE>
<TE>   A Confidence That Knows No Bounds</TE>
<TE>   The joke is as corny as they come. But that doesn't keep Schwabe
from repeating it over seven months of rehearsals.</TE>
<TE>   "How do you get to Carnegie Hall?" he taunts his students.
"Practice, practice, practice."</TE>
<TE>   That they do not groan at this chestnut is but one indication of
their youth--as if another is needed amid this sea of bare midriffs
and toe rings (on the girls), moussed hair (on the boys) and
precariously low-slung pants (on both).</TE>
<TE>   "Can we start together, please?" Schwabe asks in frustration after
a mushy launch of the fourth movement of Tchaikovsky's Fifth
Symphony. It is January, and the Carnegie trip a mere 2 1/2 months
away. For 55 minutes, Schwabe scolds and praises. "Much more speed of
bow," he orders the violins. "Very nice," he tells the timpanist.</TE>
<TE>   He reserves his favorite compliment--"That really sparkled!"--for
when things go just so. Privately, his confidence in them knows no
bounds. He is 61 and gray-haired but has abundant energy and no plans
to retire. What no one realizes, including Schwabe, is that the
school district will reach a financial crisis before the year ends.</TE>
<TE>   Since September, they have rehearsed the second and fourth
movements from the Tchaikovsky symphony. In November, they took on
Leonard Bernstein's giddy "Candide" Overture.</TE>
<TE>   Schwabe chose the pieces after considering the ensemble's strengths
(violins and horns) and weaknesses (inexperienced percussion and too few
violas).</TE>
<TE>   He also gave a nod to Carnegie's vivid past. Tchaikovsky conducted
there opening night, May 5, 1891. And composer-conductor Bernstein's
personal history was famously intertwined with the hall after his
last-minute substitution for the ailing Bruno Walter at a nationally
broadcast 1943 concert with the New York Philharmonic.</TE>
<TE>   Schwabe's musical picks would challenge many college
orchestras, and they are as the composers wrote them; no watered-down
arrangements for this bunch.</TE>
<TE>   As dozens of trophies attest, this is one of the finest
high school ensembles in California. The orchestra will perform, along
with two youth orchestras, at the invitation of MidAmerica
Productions, an independent producer that arranges such concerts.
Thanks to its reputation, the orchestra didn't have to submit an
audition tape.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, in the final movement of the Fifth, starting with measure
414, it struggles. The passage proves persistently troubling, with
its gorgeous melody but thorny, chromatic progression through sharps,
flats and naturals that don't appear in the key signature.</TE>
<TE>   They play it again and again and again.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly three-quarters of the orchestra musicians are juniors or
seniors, several of whom have been accepted to prestigious university
music programs, including Oberlin College, Vanderbilt University and
Indiana University, Schwabe's alma mater. Most have taken private
lessons for years. Several have parents who are or have been
professional musicians.</TE>
<TE>   The orchestra's mundane surroundings at Samohi--as the school is
known--belie the event ahead. Samohi's auditorium, Barnum Hall, has
been under renovation for five years. The adjacent music building has
been out of commission all this year. The orchestra practices in the
cafeteria, separated from the lunch crowd by bare drywall.</TE>
<TE>   Their mission, under Schwabe, is to make music. Not just play the
notes--anyone can play accurately, as Oscar Wilde once observed--but
to give the notes life.</TE>
<TE>   For months, Schwabe parses the Tchaikovsky measure by painstaking
measure. It is emotional music, filled by turns with heart-wrenching
yearning and swashbuckling bombast. What do 16- and 17-year-olds, who
are constantly reminded to spit out their gum and to stop their
chit-chat, know of such suffering, such passion?</TE>
<TE>   It's so timid, he tells the musicians. It's got to be twice that
loud. Everybody still needs to be more aggressive, more confident,
more powerful. Horns, it's very nice, but it sounds tight and tense.
We can improve, but we're not there yet. Keep working on that so you
don't feel frantic. There's no faking it. You can't hide on the stage
of Carnegie Hall.</TE>
<TE>   A Nerve-Racking Solo at Carnegie</TE>
<TE>   Now at Carnegie, Crespo-Szabo, the anxious percussionist, awaits
Schwabe's downbeat, and the hours of rehearsal guide her like a
strong hand at her back.</TE>
<TE>   As Schwabe snaps his arm, the jitters ease from her fingers and
she flawlessly rat-a-tats Bernstein's syncopated snare drum part. Two
of her fellow percussionists--fill-ins recruited from the back of the
violin section--resoundingly pound the bass drum and crash the
cymbals, right on cue. The piece flies to its witty conclusion and
the audience of 1,800 erupts in applause.</TE>
<TE>   After these five allegro molto con brio minutes, still about a
minute more than a professional orchestra would take, Crespo-Szabo
can relax. She has no part in the Tchaikovsky.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Catherine Bennion now feels the heat. As principal horn
player, she has the most nerve-racking solo at Carnegie--the
melancholy opening of the slow Tchaikovsky second movement, one of
the most famous horn passages ever written.</TE>
<TE>   All ears will be on her.</TE>
<TE>   Students Display a Love for Classical Music</TE>
<TE>   Bennion decided she was serious about music at the end of her
junior year.</TE>
<TE>   Homework used to come before practicing on her Holton H179 Farkas
model horn; now it comes "if and when I feel like it." On top of
playing in marching band, symphony and every pit orchestra she can
manage, she is president of the youth group at her church, the Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and conducts hymns each Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   When she can, she spends time with her steady beau, first trumpet
Trevor Casperson (the one who said, "Whoa!").</TE>
<TE>   Bennion makes light of her technically difficult instrument, which
she has played since sixth grade: "What's the difference between a
French horn and a Scud missile? The Scud missile is more accurate."</TE>
<TE>   Her accuracy will be tested with the Tchaikovsky. No matter how
she fares at Carnegie, however, it will be tough to top last summer,
when she was selected for an honors orchestra and played Mozart's
jaunty First Horn Concerto in Vienna.</TE>
<TE>   "Vienna changed me," said Bennion, who will study music at
Vanderbilt in the fall. "I had just started to take music seriously
and I knew that I had a home on the stage, that I could make a living
there."</TE>
<TE>   Her orchestra mates might not aim for musical careers, but they
bring with them, or perhaps Schwabe unleashes, a love for the kind of
music young people supposedly don't listen to.</TE>
<TE>   Rafael Ramos III, principal double bassist, commutes 40
traffic-clogged miles from Valencia to be a part of the symphony.
Always "obsessed with music," Ramos as a middle schooler would often
practice piano 14 hours a day, unprodded.</TE>
<TE>   He pays for car repairs and bass lessons with the earnings
from his custodial job at a Santa Monica hospital, a job that is in
constant jeopardy because of weekend orchestra commitments.</TE>
<TE>   Like many other musicians, Ramos attends Samohi on a permit, for
which his mother, a vocational nurse, qualified because she works in
Santa Monica. Also from outside the city are concertmaster Garrett
McLean of Venice and second-chair violin Minna Chen, from West Los
Angeles. Both are top scholars, Chen headed to Stanford, McLean to UC
Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   A beefy varsity swimmer and surfer, McLean also sings in the
Testostertones, an a cappella group with which he recently performed
in drag as Britney Spears. Music, he said, "requires discipline, a
lot of which I haven't attained yet."</TE>
<TE>   A few months ago, McLean and Chen had the heady experience of
performing with the Samohi string quartet at the Pacific Palisades
home of a prominent entertainment industry figure.</TE>
<TE>   The event was a "cultivation dinner" for an unusual $15-million
fund-raising effort designed to bolster arts education in the Santa
Monica-Malibu Unified School District. Among the guests was Mel
Gibson, honorary co-chairman of the campaign, dubbed For the Arts ...
For Every Child.</TE>
<TE>   The district encompasses a wide range of children, from the
privileged north of Montana Avenue and in the Malibu hills to those
living in poverty in congested apartment corridors. The district has
16 schools with about 12,500 students; four schools receive federal
aid for campuses with a high proportion of low-income families.</TE>
<TE>   Dedication to Arts Despite Financial Woes</TE>
<TE>   And, as with all school districts, there is never enough
money--particularly for the arts. Still, 3,000-student Samohi has six
choirs, five orchestras and seven bands.</TE>
<TE>   Among the goals of the fund-raising drive will be restoring choral
and visual arts instruction in the fourth and fifth grades. Those
programs got snuffed out after California voters passed Proposition
13 in 1978, capping property taxes, then the chief source of school
funds.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica parents have long complained that they must foot too
much of the bill for the arts, even in a district that values and
supports them more than most.</TE>
<TE>   "Parents pay for sheet music, instrument repairs, after-school
coaching," said Steve Burleigh, a lead organizer of the Carnegie trip
whose son, Nick, plays third-chair violin. "They [school officials]
pride themselves on the quality of the program, but there's no
money."</TE>
<TE>   Consider the fund-raising that preceded the Carnegie Hall trip.</TE>
<TE>   Orchestra members sent solicitation letters to everyone from
orthodontists (at least one kicked in) to local firms and cultural
institutions to uncles rich and poor.</TE>
<TE>   They sold candy and raffle tickets, held a bowl-a-thon, washed
cars. They pitched the Santa Monica City Council, which kicked in
$15,000. Total raised: $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, parents researched flights, timpani and bass rentals,
sightseeing jaunts and the best ways to pack instruments (lots of
bubble wrap and duct tape). Most families paid $1,225 per student for
a package that included hotel and air fare. The fund-raising provided
scholarships for several other students.</TE>
<TE>   Presiding over it all was Christopher Schwabe.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't talk, please!" he shouts at one evening rehearsal. "This is
very frustrating, people. Time's a-wastin'. I'm not happy."</TE>
<TE>   Schwabe got his music education degree from Indiana University
and a master's in cello, bass and conducting from Ball State University.
He has taught in the district for 29 years, five at Samohi.</TE>
<TE>   He commutes from Long Beach, arriving most days by 6:15 a.m. and
staying until 5 p.m.--often later.</TE>
<TE>   The students also put in extra time, some grudgingly, for private
lessons and evening rehearsals. They have high-caliber coaching. Each
Tuesday afternoon, Jack Cousin, a longtime double bass player with
the Los Angeles Philharmonic, coaches the five bass players,
including his ninth-grade son, Reuben.</TE>
<TE>   Cousin urges the players to memorize fast passages because "your
hand has to know it." He sprinkles his instruction with comments such
as, "When the Philharmonic would play this passage, Zubin"--as in
Mehta--"used to like us to play the 16th note a little bit late to
make it more dramatic."</TE>
<TE>   Edwin Outwater, a Samohi graduate who recently became the resident
conductor for the San Francisco Symphony under Michael Tilson Thomas,
guest-conducts one day in March.</TE>
<TE>   Outwater chastises the musicians for continuing to play after he
signals them to halt. "You guys don't know how to stop," he says.
"Learn now."</TE>
<TE>   Funny. Schwabe tells them that all the time. Maybe he's right.</TE>
<TE>   Before they know it, Thursday, March 28, has arrived.
Musicians and chaperons are to be at Los Angeles International Airport
by 5 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Unknown to the trip planners, Ramos has booked his own flight, on
a different airline. But he oversleeps and misses it. The orchestra
departs without knowing whether their strongest bass will join them.</TE>
<TE>   By evening, they are all gathered in the hotel lobby, eager to
surge en masse through Times Square. Underscoring the coming-of-age
nature of the trip, many are buoyed by the news, relayed by countless
cell phones, that college acceptance letters have arrived in the mail
back home.</TE>
<TE>   Just in time, Ramos arrives with his hastily packed suitcase, from
which he extracts his wadded-up concert jacket. It will have to serve
for warmth, since his leather jacket remains on the living room floor
in Valencia.</TE>
<TE>   That evening and the next three days are a whirlwind of city
touring, including an accidental subway ride to Brooklyn. On Friday
and Saturday, through the blear of jet lag and late-night
gallivanting, a transformation occurs. The musicians crowd into a
rehearsal room on West 41st Street.</TE>
<TE>   The importance of playing Carnegie Hall sinks in. "I didn't
understand how, like, big a deal it was," Crespo-Szabo will say
later. "But then I saw that Ani DiFranco"--a maverick folk-rock
singer whom she idolizes--"was on the bill for April. I thought,
'Wow, I beat her here!' "</TE>
<TE>   They practice for two hours and it pays off gloriously, even
though many musicians have to reposition their chairs on either side
of wide pillars to see Schwabe, even though the rental basses are
smaller than standard size, even though it's dawn back home. One
violinist nods off as he plays, his bow dropping toward the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it's the collision of exhaustion and adrenaline, but their
playing, as Schwabe might say, sparkles. Even that troublesome
section at measure 414 shines.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Schwabe keeps ironing out the kinks. "There's never enough
vibrato," he tells the strings. "Warm it up, please. It would also be
nice if the note wasn't flat."</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the seemingly contradictory directions, the chore
of a conductor keeping it all together: "Strings, don't rush. Brass,
don't drag."</TE>
<TE>   Not Just Playing Notes, but Making Music</TE>
<TE>   On concert night, Easter Sunday, the "Candide" has just finished
and now comes the romantic and rip-roaring Fifth, Tchaikovsky's ode
to life and death and mankind's drive to seek a happy ending in
defiance of fate.</TE>
<TE>   Bennion's horn solo goes well, if a tad shakily at the start. She
warms to it, gaining confidence as she goes, the melody blooming.</TE>
<TE>   The ensemble roars through the fourth movement. It is everything
Schwabe has asked for: aggressive, confident, powerful.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, it is over. The audience is on its feet.</TE>
<TE>   As Schwabe will say later: "It's one thing to play the notes and
in tune and with the proper dynamics. But they didn't just play the
notes. They made music."</TE>
<TE>   A 'Sparkly' Performance</TE>
<TE>   May brings a bittersweet coda.</TE>
<TE>   Beset by budget woes, the school district offers Schwabe and
dozens of others early retirement. After much "deep soul-searching
and torture," Schwabe decides to exit on the high note of Carnegie. A
presumably younger, and possibly cheaper, teacher will replace him.</TE>
<TE>   As it turns out, the Carnegie triumph will be "Mr. Schwabe's
Opus." In late May he announces his decision to his troops at the end
of a rehearsal.</TE>
<TE>   With tears streaming down his cheeks, he tells them: "You guys are
really something. I've taught at five high schools. I've conducted a
lot of honors orchestras. I've never had a group that achieved so
high a level, ever.</TE>
<TE>   "That performance, I'll always hold dear to me. It was sparkly. I
love you all."</TE>
<TE>   "We love you, too!" several students shout back. Then they burst
into applause.</TE>

<HD>Fund Envisions Arts Exposure for All</HD>

<LD>It isn't every community that would undertake to raise a $15-million
endowment to expand arts education in public schools. But Santa
Monica, home to many in the entertainment business, is nothing if not
different.</LD>
<LD>   For the Arts ... For Every Child is meant to ensure--for all time,
in theory--that each child in the district is exposed to the arts.</LD>
<LD>   Fund-raising, designed to pay for new teachers and supplies, is
proceeding vigorously.</LD>
<TE>   "We're well into seven figures. We are on track to meet our goal,"
said Linda Gross, executive director of the Santa Monica-Malibu
Education Foundation, through which the endowment is being raised.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign's honorary co-chairman is Mel Gibson, who was
recruited by co-chairman Greg Coote, a movie and television producer
with two children in Santa Monica schools. The men met decades ago on
the set of Gibson's breakthrough hit "Mad Max."</TE>
<TE>   Officials hope to have $7.5 million by the time the campaign is
formally rolled out in October. So far, the city of Santa Monica has
contributed more than $200,000, with the promise of an additional
$500,000.</TE>
<TE>   For 20 years, the nonprofit Santa Monica-Malibu Education Foundation
has doled out tiny grants to teachers to pay for everything from
calculators to camcorders.</TE>
<TE>   Now Gross finds herself in the big leagues, soliciting donations
at the "major gift" level--$15,000 to $150,000--and the "leadership"
level--$150,000 to $3 million.</TE>
<TE>   The arts fund has grabbed the attention of school officials
statewide, who have cornered Gross at conferences to ask for details.
Supporters expect the endowment to become a model for other
districts.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know of any municipality that has developed an external
endowment that would guarantee a steady funding stream from private
sources for staff positions and for supplies and materials," said

<HD>Police Alerted on Cash Offer for Ambulance</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEWARK, N.J.</DL>
<LD>An attempt by two Middle Eastern men to buy a fake ambulance two
weeks ago prompted warnings that terrorists may try to use bogus
emergency vehicles as weapons, authorities said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The FBI said it had interviewed one of the men, a maintenance
worker, and found that he wanted the vehicle to store tools in its
compartments.</LD>
<LD>   The other man was to be interviewed today, but FBI spokeswoman
Sandra Carroll said the agency didn't believe there is any connection
to terrorism. The men were not identified.</LD>
<TE>   The men walked into Movie Time Cars Inc., a Lyndhurst company that
rents replicas of ambulances and police cars to TV and film
producers. They offered to pay cash to buy a replica ambulance, said
owner Joe Sargo.</TE>
<TE>   "I was suspicious because most of my clients don't walk in and
offer cash to buy ambulances," he said. "I told them we couldn't do
that, and they left."</TE>
<TE>   An employee jotted down the license plate number of the delivery
truck they were driving and called police, Sargo said.</TE>
<TE>   Alerts were sent to Bergen County, N.J., and New York City police
and rescue agencies to be on the lookout for anyone trying to obtain
an emergency vehicle or look-alike. The FBI described the men as
Middle Eastern but declined to say if they were U.S. citizens.</TE>

<HD>Amtrak Reforms Unveiled--in Case It Survives Another Week</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration proposed long-term reforms for the nation's
passenger rail system Thursday, but the long-awaited proposal was
quickly upstaged by an impending cash crisis that could shut down all
Amtrak service next week.</LD>
<LD>   Amtrak President David L. Gunn said he will have to begin turning
away passengers and moving trains to storage by the middle of next
week unless the railroad gets government help to close a $200-million
shortfall.</LD>
<LD>   "The urgency of this is enormous," Gunn told the Senate
Appropriations subcommittee on transportation. "We are very near the
point of no return."</LD>
<TE>   The crisis, caused in part by uncertainty over Amtrak's future,
kept the spotlight on the railroad's immediate survival even as the
Bush administration proposed ending its role as the nation's sole
operator of intercity passenger trains.</TE>
<TE>   "The last three decades have proved that Amtrak's model of a
national network of passenger rail is just not sustainable without
massive, continued federal support," Transportation Secretary Norman
Y. Mineta said in a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's proposal would stop annual federal operating
subsidies for rail service, open the door to competition, give states
more responsibility for train service and replace Amtrak as owner of
the Boston-New York-Washington Northeast Corridor.</TE>
<TE>   Some Amtrak jobs eventually could be assigned to outside companies
by contract, and failing routes could be eliminated unless states
want to pay for them.</TE>
<TE>   "Prices and passengers, not politics, should direct the service,"
Mineta said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers from both parties urged the administration to focus on
rescuing Amtrak from its predicament before looking ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "We can heal a sick patient--and Amtrak is hurting right now--but
we cannot revive a dead patient," said Rep. Jack Quinn (R-N.Y.),
chairman of the House Transportation subcommittee on railroads.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Railroad Administration is reviewing Amtrak's request
for a loan guarantee that would help it borrow the $200 million.
Amtrak has had trouble tapping its existing line of credit because
lenders are worried about how long it will remain in business.</TE>
<TE>   At the Senate hearing, Federal Railroad Administrator Allan Rutter
and Donna McLean, the Transportation Department's chief financial
officer, said there is no contingency plan in the event the loan
guarantee does not come through.</TE>
<TE>   McLean said the administration would entertain the idea of an
emergency government appropriation to Amtrak only in conjunction with
the reforms Mineta spelled out in his speech.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you understand the gravity of ceasing Amtrak operations?"
asked Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.).</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly do," McLean replied.</TE>
<TE>   Assuming it survives the next three months, Amtrak says it needs
$1.2 billion from the government to get through the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1.</TE>
<TE>   But Mineta said Amtrak should get no more than $521 million--the
same amount it has received in recent years--unless it undergoes
substantial reform.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's ideas reflect several suggestions of the
Amtrak Reform Council, formed by Congress in 1997 to monitor Amtrak's
finances.</TE>
<TE>   The council recommended breaking up the rail company and shifting
many of its duties to states and private companies, effectively
ending Amtrak's three-decade monopoly over intercity train service.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thrilled to death," said Gil Carmichael, a former federal
railroad administrator who chaired the reform council. "The old
Amtrak is coming to a close and the new Amtrak is about to be born."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a leading critic of Amtrak, also
praised the Bush plan.</TE>
<TE>   "I fully agree that we cannot afford simply to throw billions of
additional federal dollars at Amtrak and hope its problems will
disappear," he wrote in a letter to Mineta.</TE>

<HD>Asteroid Whizzes Past Earth in a 'Close Shave'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAMBRIDGE, Mass.</DL>
<LD>An asteroid the size of a soccer field narrowly missed the Earth by
75,000 miles--one of the closest known approaches by an object of
this size, scientists said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "In the unlikely event the asteroid had struck Earth in a
populated area, it would have caused considerable loss of life," said
scientist Grant Stokes. "The energy release would be of the magnitude
of a large nuclear weapon."</LD>
<LD>   Stokes is the principal investigator for the MIT-affiliated
Lincoln Near Earth Asteroid Research Project, whose New Mexico
observatory spotted the object last week.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a close shave," said another scientist, Brian Marsden of
the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge.</TE>
<TE>   Marsden, whose organization gathers information on all such
encounters, called it "the only object of this size known to have
come closer to the Earth than the moon in decades."</TE>
<TE>   It was not detected until three days after it came close to the
Earth on June 14. When such asteroids are detected, they are usually
spotted well out in space when they are approaching or going away
from Earth.</TE>
<TE>   The asteroid, provisionally named 2002 MN, was traveling faster
than 23,000 mph when it was spotted, Stokes said in a phone interview
from Lexington, Mass., where he is associate head of the aerospace
division of MIT Lincoln Laboratory.</TE>
<TE>   With a diameter of 50 to 120 yards, the asteroid was about the
size of a soccer field, Stokes said. The size of asteroids is
estimated by measuring their brightness, without knowing their
composition. Damage on the ground depends on what an asteroid is made
of, varying from solid metal to a loosely bound aggregate.</TE>
<TE>   There is no dedicated program to search for objects as small as
2002 MN.</TE>
<TE>   "NASA has a goal of discovering and obtaining good orbits for all
the near-Earth objects with diameters larger than 1 kilometer [.62
mile]," said Thomas Morgan, a scientist at NASA headquarters in
Washington. "Asteroids of this size could potentially destroy
civilization as we know it."</TE>
<TE>   Such asteroids could theoretically hit Earth every million years,
or at longer intervals.</TE>
<TE>   Asteroids the size of 2002 MN are estimated to hit the Earth every
100 to several hundred years, causing local damage but no disaster to
civilization or the planet's ecosystem, Stokes said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something the public should know about but shouldn't get
nervous about," he said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Daryl Atkins was 18 when, in 1996, he and another man confronted Eric
Nesbitt, an Air Force serviceman, outside a convenience store near
Hampton, Va., and forced him at gunpoint to withdraw money from an
automated teller machine.</LD>
<LD>   The pair then drove Nesbitt, in his pickup truck, to a remote
area, where Atkins shot the airman eight times, killing him.</LD>
<LD>   During Atkins' trial, there was conflicting testimony over whether
he is mentally retarded. While a defense expert said Atkins had an IQ
of 59 and was a poor student, an expert for the state said he was not
retarded and of average intelligence.</LD>
<TE>   The jury convicted Atkins after relying on testimony from his
co-conspirator.</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for the state of Virginia argued that jurors should be
permitted to consider all the facts and make an ''individualized
sentencing decision.'' At the sentencing hearing, the jury heard
descriptions of 16 other crimes that Atkins had committed, including
robberies and assaults.</TE>
<TE>   The jury sentenced Atkins to death. While accepting that Atkins
had a very low IQ, the Virginia Supreme Court upheld the death
sentence.</TE>

<HD>Forester Pleads Not Guilty in Blaze</HD>
<DH>Court: Federal worker is accused of deliberately setting
the wildfire, the largest in Colorado's history. The judge sets bail
at $600,000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>U.S. Forest Service employee Terry Lynn Barton pleaded not guilty
Thursday to charges that she deliberately set the largest wildfire in
Colorado history.</LD>
<LD>   A federal judge set bail for Barton with several stipulations. His
ruling came after a 3 1/2-hour hearing in which prosecutors outlined
their case against the 18-year Forest Service veteran.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors said Thursday that Barton lied about accidentally
starting the fire after burning a letter from her estranged husband.
There was no letter, they say. They said an angry Barton deliberately
set the fire and even rearranged rocks in a campfire ring so that the
flames would escape. Then, prosecutors say, Barton covered up her
crime and lied about it.</LD>
<TE>   The 38-year-old mother of two cried at times and smiled to
acknowledge a parade of friends who testified as character witnesses.
She waved to supporters as she was led from the courtroom. She did
not immediately post bond.</TE>
<TE>   In granting the $600,000 bail, Judge Michael Watanabe said the
evidence presented indicated Barton had "lived an exemplary life,"
but as a condition of her release he ordered Barton to stay at a
halfway house, not leave the state and forbade her from entering a
forest.</TE>
<TE>   A federal grand jury Wednesday charged Barton with setting fire to
timber in a national forest, damaging federal property, injuring a
firefighter and using fire to commit a felony. If found guilty of all
the charges, Barton could face a maximum of 65 years in prison and $1
million in fines.</TE>
<TE>   Barton was patrolling the Pike National Forest on June 8 looking
for violators of the state's fire ban when the Hayman fire began.
Late that afternoon, she reported an out-of-control campfire and said
she battled it but it grew too large.</TE>
<TE>   Fire investigators quickly began to doubt her story. After
repeated interrogations, Barton allegedly confessed to accidentally
starting the fire. Authorities said she told them she was upset and
burned a two-page letter from her estranged husband in a campfire
ring.</TE>
<TE>   But in testimony Thursday, Forest Service special agent Brenda
Schultz said it appeared that Barton had manipulated the rocks in the
fire ring to allow flames to escape and said burned grass and part of
a stick were found in the fire pit.</TE>
<TE>   Schultz said that Barton's husband, John, told investigators he
never wrote his wife a letter. Schultz also said no ash from paper
was found.</TE>
<TE>   Using enlarged maps of the fire area and photographs as exhibits,
Assistant U.S. Atty. William L. Taylor took Schultz through the
painstaking investigation, in which officials concluded that Barton
could not have smelled smoke from the distance she claimed and that
Barton deliberately set the fire.</TE>
<TE>   Schultz said investigators concluded that the fire--which has
burned 136,000 acres--grew rapidly, moving at a foot per second.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor questioned Barton's co-workers about her actions at work
the day of the fire, suggesting that she was upset that no one would
agree to go on patrol with her that afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   He also said that Barton had requested to attend a federal arson
investigation school.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses called by federal public defender Warren Williamson
praised Barton for her devotion to her job, her family and her
community. They characterized her as a caring woman who was on the
verge of detaching herself from a troubled marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Co-worker Megen Kabele said of John Barton: "He's not a reliable
person. [Terry] has had to be the reliable adult for her girls."</TE>
<TE>   Barton's supervisor, Sara Mayben, called Barton one of her most
trusted employees and described the tense scene when she said Barton
told her she had set the fire.</TE>
<TE>   "I think her words were, 'You're going to be mad at me.' I don't
think I was mad at her. I think I was just more shocked and
saddened," Mayben said.</TE>
<TE>   Mayben was among those who told authorities after Barton's
disclosure June 15 that the distraught woman might attempt suicide.
That night Barton stayed in a hotel room in Colorado Springs with her
eldest daughter and a friend.</TE>
<TE>   She was arrested without incident the next day.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor argued that Barton was a flight risk because of public
outrage over the damage wrought by the fire.</TE>
<TE>   He said Barton had received death threats and that her sister, who
has been caring for Barton's children, took the girls and left their
home at the suggestion of the sheriff.</TE>
<TE>   But half a dozen witnesses said Barton's good work in the
community had engendered support and that she was the kind of person
who would take responsibility for her actions.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a person who cares what people think about her," said Jason
Lee Chappell, a Forest Service worker who is dating Barton's
daughter. "She couldn't live with herself if she didn't stay. I think
she really believes she should put it right."</TE>

abide by safety rules. Several federal courts, including one in
California, said tow trucks are like interstate trucks and are
off-limits to local regulations. But the justices rejected that idea
and upheld the local laws (City of Columbus vs. OursGarage and
Wrecker Service, 01-149).</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Harbury, a human rights activist, cannot sue Clinton
administration officials, including former Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, on the claim that they lied about the whereabouts of her
Guatemalan rebel husband, who was executed. The court said
administration officials did not prevent her from going to court, but
in any event, a judge could not have saved her husband (Harbury vs.
Christopher, 01-394).</TE>

<HD>Man Cleared in Sept. 11 Attacks Guilty of Fraud</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A man who came under intense scrutiny after he was arrested Sept. 12
with a box cutter and hair dye pleaded guilty Thursday to credit card
fraud charges.</LD>
<LD>   Syed Gul Mohammed Shah admitted selling 15 fraudulent credit cards
for as much as $2,000 each on the black market. He faces up to 18
months in prison when he is sentenced Aug. 15.</LD>
<LD>   Another man charged in the case, Mohammed Azmath, pleaded guilty
to related charges earlier this month.</LD>
<TE>   Outside court Thursday, defense attorney Lawrence Feitell said
Shah was falsely labeled a potential terrorist amid a roundup of
Arab-looking men in the weeks following the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators later concluded Shah and Azmath were not linked to
terrorism. But they charged them with credit card fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Shah and Azmath boarded a plane in Newark, N.J., on Sept. 11 to go
to San Antonio. They were stranded in St. Louis when their plane was
grounded along with all other air traffic after the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The men then got on an Amtrak train to Texas, where they were
arrested in Fort Worth after law officers found two box cutters, hair
dye, a knife and several thousand dollars among their belongings.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the men said they had just lost their newsstand jobs
in New Jersey, where they used box cutters to open boxes and bundles
of newspapers and magazines. The dye was to cover gray hair, and the
men had the money because they were going to San Antonio in search of
work, lawyers said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Seattle area man fatally shot his fiancee and her mother, wounded
two other people and then killed himself over the body of his
wife-to-be, a day after she told authorities she suspected him of
molesting her 7-year-old daughter.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities found the bodies of Marjorie Monnett, 55, and her
daughter, Holly Swartz, 30, in the street in front of Monnett's home
on the southern end of Whidbey Island, about 28 miles north of
Seattle. Swartz's fiance, Preston Dean "Hugh" Douglas, 27, was dead
on top of her.</LD>
<LD>   Monnett's 22-year-old son was hospitalized in satisfactory
condition after surgery, and his girlfriend was in serious condition.</LD>
<TE>   Sheriff Michael A. Hawley said Douglas, an unemployed landscaper,
pulled up outside the home about 1:30 a.m. Thursday, walked in the
back door and opened fire, then continued firing outdoors. Swartz's
7-year-old daughter ran from her grandmother's home during the
rampage and was not hurt.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The American Medical Assn., meeting in Chicago, endorsed a new
80-hour workweek limit for medical residents to try to keep
doctors-in-training from becoming so bleary-eyed that they hurt
themselves or their patients.</LD>
<LD>   Many doctors-in-training put in more than 100 hours a week and
sometimes toil for 36 hours straight. Advocates for the 80-hour week
have said that residents have fallen asleep while performing surgery
or while driving home after their shifts.</LD>
<LD>   Under the policy adopted by the AMA House of Delegates, the
association recommended that residents not work more than 80 hours a
week or more than 24 hours at a stretch, except under special
circumstances. That is nearly identical to rules announced earlier
this month by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical
Education.</LD>

San Juan Island.</LD>
<LD>   Derelict fishing nets, or "ghost nets" as divers call them, can
trap and kill marine animals, birds and even people. The state
Department of Natural Resources and the Northwest Straits Commission
teamed up to remove the fishing net that was snagged on a reef north
of San Juan Island. The net is hundreds of feet long and weighs 2
tons to 3 tons.</LD>
<LD>   Divers freed the net and floated it to the surface, where a
fisherman who volunteered his 75-foot purse seiner pulled it from the
water.</LD>

<HD>One Phase of Clinton Clemency Inquiry Ends Without Charges</HD>
<DH>Investigation: The pardon of four Hasidic Jews as he left
office raised questions about a link to his wife's U.S. Senate
campaign.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The Justice Department announced Thursday it has concluded a grand
jury inquiry into former President Clinton's eleventh-hour grant of
clemency to four influential members of a Hasidic community that
voted by a huge margin to send Hillary Rodham Clinton to the U.S.
Senate.</LD>
<LD>   "We thoroughly investigated it, and it wasn't appropriate to bring
charges against anybody in the case," said U.S. Atty. James B. Comey
in Manhattan.</LD>
<LD>   The investigation centered on whether the president's decision in
the closing hours of his administration was a favor for the political
support given to his wife's successful 2000 election campaign.</LD>
<TE>   New Square, a highly cohesive village in Rockland County, north of
New York City, voted 1,400 to 12 for Hillary Rodham Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   Comey said his office still is looking into other last-minute
pardons issued by President Clinton but declined to be specific.</TE>
<TE>   "I have nothing to say about those," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Informed of the U.S. attorney's decision to end this phase of the
investigation, Clinton said he was not surprised.</TE>
<TE>   "There was never any reason to believe anybody had done anything
wrong," the former president said.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Sen. Clinton declined to comment on the Justice
Department's decision.</TE>
<TE>   Her lawyer, David E. Kendall, said it was "a welcome, albeit
completely predictable resolution."</TE>
<TE>   Kalmen Stern, David Goldstein, Benjamin Berger and Jacob Elbaum
were sent to prison after being convicted in 1999 in an elaborate
scheme that included systematically defrauding the government of tens
of millions of dollars in loans to ineligible or fictitious students.</TE>
<TE>   In December 2000, Sen.-elect Clinton met at the White House with
two leaders of the New Square community who supported clemency for
the four men.</TE>
<TE>   She and the leaders then met in the White House Map Room for about
45 minutes with President Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   Hillary Rodham Clinton has said she played no part in her
husband's decision to grant clemency.</TE>
<TE>   Among the matters still being scrutinized by prosecutors is
President Clinton's decision to pardon fugitive financier Marc Rich,
who was indicted in 1983 by a federal grand jury in New York on
charges including tax evasion and racketeering.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors at the time alleged Rich evaded more than $48 million
in taxes and took part in illegal oil deals with Iran while U.S.
diplomats were being held hostage in that Middle Eastern nation.</TE>
<TE>   Rich, who left the United States before his indictment, is living
in Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   Government lawyers have been trying to determine whether his
pardon was linked to large contributions that Rich's former wife,
Denise Rich, made to Democratic causes, including Hillary Rodham
Clinton's Senate campaign and the Clinton presidential library in
Arkansas.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to pardon Rich, who never served any sentence,
provoked anger from frustrated federal prosecutors who had sought for
almost two decades to bring him to trial.</TE>

<HD>New FEC Rules Add Loopholes in Soft-Money Ban</HD>
<DH>Politics: Critics charge the commission with 'rewriting'
the law and allowing the illegal contributions. Some say it keeps
options open.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK FINEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Federal Election Commission on Thursday ended two days of bitter
debate over landmark campaign-finance reform legislation by crafting
a set of enforcement regulations that reformers and the bill's
sponsors said have written new loopholes for soft money into a law
that was meant to close them.</LD>
<LD>   In a joint statement Thursday night, the bill's authors accused
the FEC of "rewriting" the law, which took them seven hard-fought
years to get through Congress, through a series of amendments that
"ignore" the law.</LD>
<LD>   "The FEC's job is ... to enforce the law, not undermine it,"
declared Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Russell D. Feingold (D-Wis.)
and Reps. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) and Martin T. Meehan (D-Mass.).</LD>
<TE>   McCain earlier had warned that if the commission violated the
soft-money ban, the law's centerpiece, his group had three options:
Bring the regulations before Congress to disapprove them, further
amend the law and even introduce new legislation "to change the
entire Federal Election Commission."</TE>
<TE>   Their statement Thursday night offered no hint which, if any,
option they would pursue, but several FEC sources and independent
analysts said it was unlikely that the sponsors would bring the law
back to Congress for another round of agonizing debate.</TE>
<TE>   Before adjourning Thursday, the six commissioners adopted the last
of half a dozen key amendments that narrowed the law's effect on soft
money even beyond a final draft of the rules that the sponsors
rejected as too watered down. The commissioners are to hold a final
technical session Saturday, when they are expected to formally
approve the rules.</TE>
<TE>   The rules must be published by June 25 and take effect Nov. 6.</TE>
<TE>   McCain has defined the law's principal aims as banning national
political parties from having anything to do with soft money,
restricting state parties' use of it in federal campaigns and banning
"federal officeholders and candidates, national party officials and
agents from soliciting soft money."</TE>
<TE>   Even with the commission's amendments, the main thrust of the
law--to ban the massive infusion of soft money for national parties
and candidates--remains intact.</TE>
<TE>   But at the very end of an extraordinary session that lasted until
nearly midnight Wednesday--long after most of the audience of
reporters and watchdog groups' members had left--the commission
voted, 4 to 1 with one abstention, to narrowly redefine the word
"solicit" in a way that bars federal officials only from directly
asking for such money.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the commissioners, by a 4-2 vote, expanded exemptions
for federal officeholders and candidates in a new rule that would
permit them to be featured guests and speakers at state political
party fund-raisers, so-called cattle calls. These fund-raisers are
designed to raise vast amounts of soft money, which is generally
defined as unregulated contributions from corporations, labor unions
and other wealthy special interests.</TE>
<TE>   "The effect of these new definitions," the law's sponsors said
Thursday, "could be to allow federal candidates and party leaders to
continue to raise soft money for the state parties using careful
language or a 'wink and a nod.' "</TE>
<TE>   Mirroring earlier votes, the bipartisan FEC passed the latest
amendments by 4-2 votes, with the three Republicans and Democrat Karl
J. Sandstrom voting to adopt them.</TE>
<TE>   "What you have is four commissioners who view the new law as a
problem," said Larry Noble, who worked for the FEC for 23 years and
now heads the watchdog group Center for Responsive Politics.</TE>
<TE>   "They're writing the loopholes into the law, and these loopholes
will leverage and broaden between now and the 2004 elections," Noble
said, defining the unusually heated rulemaking process as "both an
ideological problem and a political problem."</TE>
<TE>   Noble, who was the FEC's chief counsel for a decade, conceded the
commission played a major role in creating the soft-money loophole
through its rulings.</TE>
<TE>   But he added: "It took 20 years to build the early loopholes into
the law, and here they're doing it in two days."</TE>
<TE>   Sandstrom flatly denied that in an interview after Thursday's
session.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not creating a loophole. It is keeping open the ability of
state and local candidates to run their own campaign outside of
federal regulation," said Sandstrom, who believes the new law may
violate basic principles of federalism.</TE>
<TE>   As the commissioner who cast tiebreaking votes, Sandstrom has been
accused by lawmakers and other critics of weakening the soft-money
ban. But he insisted, "I think I've strengthened our political
process by giving a more reasonable reading to what would have been
an extreme reading."</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Bradley A. Smith, a conservative Republican who
sponsored several of the more hotly debated amendments, also
responded to outside criticism at the start of Thursday's debate.</TE>
<TE>   Smith called the reaction to the FEC's new definition of "solicit"
"near hysteria in the press and the so-called reform community." He
said the definition merely "rejects the extremist position ... that
we should look at the 'wink and the nod." '</TE>
<TE>   To the commission's critics, he added, "Just relax."</TE>
<TE>   Later, following another contentious debate, Sandstrom withdrew an
amendment so controversial that Smith had warned it would be "a
lightning rod" for "hysteria." The proposed rule would have allowed
national political parties to continue to raise and spend soft money
for their legal defense funds.</TE>
<TE>   Even the FEC's chief counsel's office argued--as its lawyers did
several times on other amendments Thursday--that Sandstrom's proposal
would blatantly violate the language and intent of the reform law.</TE>
<TE>   One of the longest-serving commissioners, Democrat Scott E.
Thomas, attempted to make the same case before voting against the
most substantial new rules.</TE>
<TE>   Before one rare, unanimous vote, Thomas spoke on behalf of fellow
Democrat Danny Lee McDonald and quipped, "Just to show the spirit of
great cooperation, we'll approve this. Besides, we've already
approved this approach, and there's nothing we can do about it."</TE>

<HD>Raging Fires Spark Cooperative Spirit</HD>
<DH>Disaster: Law enforcement officials are lending a hand as
blazes tear through the mountains of Colorado. Evacuations continue.</DH>

<DL>DURANGO, Colo.</DL>
<LD>It was a tossup which was the more distinctive smell--the bitter
pungent odor of the forest fire that was scorching conifers and
ponderosa pine in the western Rocky Mountains or the fried chicken
inside the food-filled SUV that Dan Bender was tooling around in,
searching for fires and firefighters.</LD>
<LD>   Driving through the deceivingly quiet midsection of a 59,000-acre
fire, Bender--a local sheriff's lieutenant and SWAT commander--was
helping overwhelmed firefighters track so-called spot fires--small,
smoldering fires ignited by embers blown from the mother blaze. If
not spotted and extinguished, they could erupt into full-blown blazes
and level homes surrounding two lakes.</LD>
<LD>   He stopped alongside a small lake and radioed his dispatcher.
"One, two, three, four spot fires, east side of Vallecito Lake, near
a stretch of six homes."</LD>
<TE>   Within 10 minutes, a lumbering Chinook helicopter dropped its
bucket into the lake, pulled up 600 gallons of water and dumped it on
the most threatening spot fire.</TE>
<TE>   It was a small victory in the face of such enormity, but Bender
said it proved the value of law enforcement's partnership with
firefighters. "There are more than 1,000 firefighters out here
somewhere," he said. "But this is a big forest, and it swallows up
1,000 firefighters pretty quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, monster blazes in Colorado and Arizona seemed to be
swallowing any efforts Thursday to contain them.</TE>
<TE>   The newest fire threatened mountain communities about 100 miles
northeast of Phoenix. The Rodeo fire, which was only 600 acres
Tuesday, had grown to at least 85,000 acres Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   About 4,000 residents of Clay Springs, Pineville and Linden were
evacuated Wednesday. On Thursday, the fire swept through Pineville,
forcing firefighters to hastily retreat. Authorities had not counted
the number of lost structures. The 7,700 residents of Show Low were
told to prepare to leave, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   A 2,600-acre blaze nearby, apparently resulting from a signal fire
set by a lost hiker, forced the evacuation of the 1,500 residents of
Heber and Overgaard.</TE>
<TE>   Outside Denver, the Hayman fire, which has burned 136,000 acres of
timber and brush, stalled somewhat Thursday with cooler temperatures
but flared up on one front, forcing firefighters to run for their
lives. About 95 structures have been destroyed by the blaze,
including homes, barns and other buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the blaze, the biggest in Colorado history, will be
burning for weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Here in Durango, about 240 miles southwest of Denver, firefighters
were flustered by the antics of the Missionary Ridge fire. It was
burning in three directions and late Thursday erupted in an
unexpected flurry of flames on the western front.</TE>
<TE>   La Plata County emergency officials ordered hundreds of residents
below the burning mountain slopes not just to evacuate but to flee.</TE>
<TE>   The fire was probably sparked by the hot carbon droppings of a
car's catalytic converter along a forest service road, authorities
said. It has destroyed 33 homes and was threatening more. With
firefighters overwhelmed, Bender and about 30 other sheriff's
deputies and supervisors--even the sheriff--were helping.</TE>
<TE>   One day they're rapping on doors, ordering residents to evacuate.
Another day, they're staffing roadblocks, preventing residents from
returning or escorting people to their homes for emergency reasons.
On Thursday, Bender was on food and spot fire duty, handing out
snacks to hungry firefighters while looking for spindly columns of
white smoke that, if this were winter, might suggest a roaring
fireplace in a snug mountain cabin.</TE>
<TE>   The 51-year-old law officer stopped at the north end of Vallecito
Lake--mostly caked mudflats now--and marveled at the fire's fury.</TE>
<TE>   The water level is only 5% of normal because of the drought. In
the middle of the dry lake, vehicles that had been parked there by
residents for safety had blistered from the heat of the forest fire a
quarter-mile away. The firestorm's winds toppled a pickup truck
camper and a swath of trees.</TE>
<TE>   Standing atop the lake's earthen dam, Bender watched smoke rise
from rocks, and he wondered what in the world was burning.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Bender came across eight hungry firefighters from
Spokane and Winthrop, Wash., some sitting in their vehicles and
others scattered on the porch of a home in the middle of a grassy
valley. On ridgelines all around them, plumes of smoke turned the sky
slate gray; this group was prepared to put out any nearby spot fires.</TE>
<TE>   Bender got out of his truck and unloaded boxes of fried chicken,
candy, drinks, chewing tobacco, gum and other snacks. "Holy moley,
this is good," said one firefighter, tearing into a meaty thigh. Said
another, "Durango has been awfully good to us. People are donating
all sorts of stuff. Some even tried to give us money."</TE>
<TE>   Two firefighters from South Dakota drove up in their pickup,
saying they were trying to find their crew. Bender gave the pair food
and sent them to a shady canyon.</TE>
<TE>   Bender returned to his fire patrol, and the routine continued.
Two, three, four spot fires to the north. Four--no, five--fires over
there. Little plumes of white smoke everywhere, each with the
potential to erupt in a forest so large, it swallows firefighters.</TE>

<HD>Bush Urges Americans to Get Off the Couch and Into Fitness</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHELLE MUNN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>When President Bush ventured out onto the South Lawn on Thursday, the
questions weren't about his plans for ousting Saddam Hussein or
moving the Middle East toward peace. Instead it was: "Did you work
out today?" and "Show us your muscles!"</LD>
<LD>   The commander in chief's appearance marked the official launch of
a new federal effort to get Americans to stay fit, eat healthier and
kick bad habits such as smoking, drinking and abusing drugs.</LD>
<LD>   In a campaign reminiscent of one launched by President Kennedy
four decades ago, Bush appointed a presidential council and issued an
executive order to promote fitness. He also issued 12 pages of
recommendations on how Americans can improve their lifestyles.</LD>
<TE>   Bush, 55 and an exercise enthusiast, can run a mile in six to
seven minutes, aides say. Most days he runs three miles on a
treadmill. Lifting weights also keeps the president fit.</TE>
<TE>   "Exercise is a part of my daily life. It kind of helps me deal
with the stress a little better," the president wryly noted.</TE>
<TE>   "After I get a good run in," he claimed, "I even like the press
corps a bit better."</TE>
<TE>   Standing in the morning sun in an open-collared blue shirt, khaki
trousers and a belt emblazoned with the presidential seal, Bush
ignored his cue cards and turned passionate.</TE>
<TE>   "How about just walking 30 minutes a day?" he asked an audience
made up of preteen soccer players, seniors and assorted amateur and
professional athletes.</TE>
<TE>   "That's pretty simple. It's easy to do," he said. "How about
parents just playing a game with children in their backyard for 30
minutes or an hour? It would be good for the child, it would be good
for the parent and it's good for the family."</TE>
<TE>   There is reason for the president's concern. A third of American
children get less than one hour of exercise a week, experts say. As
adults, they could turn into couch potatoes; already 60% of American
adults get no exercise.</TE>
<TE>   "It's amazing how unhealthy and unfit Americans are," said Nick
Baird, a physician and member of the newly created President's
Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. But he contended that
Americans can develop healthy habits even if they start on a small
scale.</TE>
<TE>   "You just have to take a small step; pretty soon that builds on
itself," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Better health has a financial payoff: About $138 billion is spent
on heart disease treatment each year, according to statistics cited
by the White House. One-third of cancer deaths could be prevented by
improving diet and fitness.</TE>
<TE>   Bush maintained a light tone, joking that he had been trying for
years to get his father to eat broccoli. Former President George Bush
famously displeased farmers by refusing to eat the vegetable or serve
it at state dinners.</TE>
<TE>   Staffers chatted about their regimens. White House counselor Karen
Hughes, wearing black spandex shorts and a white T-shirt, said she
swims one mile, five times a week.</TE>
<TE>   Some in the audience talked about how they had anticipated the
health boom decades ago. Myrtle Smith Church, the reigning Ms. Senior
District of Columbia, said walking and yoga help her minimize her
arthritis and maintain a 123-pound physique ("with no girdle") at 76.</TE>
<TE>   Twice a week, Church takes part in a stretching program at a
seniors' center.</TE>
<TE>   She avoided troublesome addictions early on. "I tried to smoke,
but I didn't like it," she said, adjusting her rhinestone tiara.</TE>
<TE>   Church glanced at the stage, where music boomed and people in
their 30s and 40s bounced, part of an aerobics squad made up of top
Bush staffers. Twelve trainers from the Sports Club/LA fitness chain
mounted the stage to demonstrate kickboxing and military fitness
moves.</TE>

<HD>Patients' Rights Get Lift From Justices</HD>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Patients whose health maintenance organizations deny
them a medical treatment or drug benefit have a right to a second
opinion from outside doctors, the Supreme Court ruled Thursday,
upholding the new "independent review" laws in California and 41
other states.</LD>
<LD>   The 5-4 decision endorses a middle-ground reform in the continuing
fight between consumer advocates and the health insurance industry
about who should make medical decisions.</LD>
<LD>   For many patients, the independent review system promises a quick
and reliable answer to the question of whether a medical treatment is
wise and necessary.</LD>
<TE>   If they appeal to a state board, then a medical specialist or a
panel of three doctors will review their case. If they agree that the
treatment or drug is needed, the board can force the HMO to pay for
it.</TE>
<TE>   But many patients are unaware of the review system, and relatively
few have taken advantage of it.</TE>
<TE>   California's review system was launched in January 2001, and the
Department of Managed Health Care in Sacramento said it had handled
the claims of more than 800 people.</TE>
<TE>   In roughly two-thirds of those cases, the outside doctors
supported the HMOs' original decisions. In the remainder of cases,
the doctors sided with patients and persuaded the HMOs to provide the
benefit or ordered that it be paid.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Zingale, the director of the state agency, said the system
operates on the premise that "patients want to see a doctor, not a
lawyer. They want the care before the damage is done, rather than
suing after the fact."</TE>
<TE>   In Thursday's ruling, the high court retreated somewhat from
earlier rulings that had shielded HMOs from virtually all state laws.</TE>
<TE>   In 1987, the court ruled that the federal law regulating employee
benefits did not allow states to require employers to add more
benefits. If employees could sue in state court over a medical
benefit, that would violate the federal rule by forcing employers to
pay more, the court said.</TE>
<TE>   This ruling loomed large in the 1990s, when most employers decided
to insure their workers through managed care plans, which were
designed to hold down costs for employers. Sometimes, the plans would
not pay for treatments, including those for sick children.</TE>
<TE>   Outraged, patients learned that they could not sue their HMOs
because the insurers were shielded by the federal law.</TE>
<TE>   As public anger grew, state and federal lawmakers looked for a
better way of protecting patients.</TE>
<TE>   Congress took up a patients' bill of rights, which would have
overturned the Supreme Court's opinion and allowed patients to sue
their health-care providers, but that legislation has stalled.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, many states adopted the independent review system.
State officials contended that because it does not involve a lawsuit
against an HMO, it did not conflict with the federal benefits law.</TE>
<TE>   Health-care insurers disagreed, and they mounted a major attack on
the independent review laws. They argued that, in essence, states
were trying to regulate employee benefits and force companies to pay
more.</TE>
<TE>   In Texas, the U.S. Court of Appeals struck down the independent
review system, which had been championed by then-Gov. George W. Bush.</TE>
<TE>   In Illinois, however, an appeals court upheld the state's law and
described it as a regulation of insurance, not employee benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The justices took up the dispute in the Illinois case and also
upheld the state's law.</TE>
<TE>   Justice David H. Souter said the state law simply gives patients
the medical benefits they have been promised.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, states have had a long tradition of regulating
insurance, and that does not conflict with the federal benefits law.</TE>
<TE>   In the Illinois case, Debra Moran of suburban Chicago, began
experiencing pain and numbness in her right shoulder in 1996. She
tried exercise therapy at her doctor's suggestion, but the pain
worsened.</TE>
<TE>   Moran learned of a Virginia surgeon who had had success with an
experimental nerve surgery. Her doctor approved of the surgery for
her, but Rush Prudential HMO, her insurer, refused to pay for it.</TE>
<TE>   Undaunted, she had the operation, paying the $95,000 herself. She
then appealed the claim to the state board under the terms of a new
and relatively untested HMO law giving patients the right to a
"timely review" by an outside doctor.</TE>
<TE>   A specialist at Johns Hopkins University Medical Center in
Baltimore reviewed the case and determined that the treatment was
medically necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Rush Prudential refused to pay her claim, and sued in
federal court to challenge the state law.</TE>
<TE>   In Rush Prudential HMO vs. Moran (00-1021), the high court sided
with the patient and said the state had the power to order the claim
paid. Joining Souter were Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day
O'Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.</TE>
<TE>   In dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas said the ruling destroys the
uniform federal regulation in this area and predicted that it would
lead to higher costs for business.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington and in California, experts disagreed about whether
the ruling will boost the demand for a patients' bill of rights, or
defuse it.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't give patients anything new, but it protects what we
have, which isn't enough," said Jamie Court, executive director of
the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Other consumer advocates noted that state laws give no protection
to the 56 million Americans whose health plans are self-insured, and
not truly insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Rep. Charlie Norwood (R-Ga.),
the sponsors of the federal patients' bill of rights, said the ruling
highlighted the need for a national law.</TE>
<TE>   "State reviews are not a substitute for strong federal action,"
Kennedy said, as patients cannot be compensated if they or a loved
one dies or suffers greatly because a treatment was delayed or
denied.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the health-insurance industry say they have supported
independent reviews of medical decisions, but they oppose putting
this requirement into state or federal laws.</TE>
<TE>   "Legislation creates new requirements and more lawsuits at a time
when health-care costs are exploding," said Karen Ignani, president
and chief executive of the nation's largest HMO trade group, the
American Assn. of Health Plans. "We don't want the health-care system
to unravel."</TE>
<TE>   The Health Benefits Coalition, which represents 3 million
employers, agreed, saying the court's decision makes it more crucial
than ever to block federal legislation "that would increase
health-care costs further."</TE>

<HD>White House Angered by Leaks on Intelligence</HD>
<DH>Security: Media reports about communication intercepted on
Sept. 10 cited congressional sources. Lawmakers promise to crack
down.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU and JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- The White House charged Thursday that unnamed
congressional sources compromised national security by leaking
sensitive counter-terrorism material, a charge that reignited the
debate over how much the public should know in a time of war.</LD>
<LD>   An irate Vice President Dick Cheney called two congressional
leaders to convey President Bush's ''deep concerns'' about media
reports disclosing that U.S. eavesdroppers picked up cryptic
references on Sept. 10 to a possible attack the next day.</LD>
<LD>   Leaders of the joint House-Senate panel investigating Sept. 11
intelligence failures promised an immediate crackdown on leaks and
asked the Justice Department to determine the source of the media
reports. Privately, however, some Capitol Hill officials grumbled
that the Bush administration is conducting its war on terrorism
largely in secret, without scrutiny and input from Congress or the
public.</LD>
<TE>   The episode comes at a time when the Bush administration has
angered many open-government advocates by moving aggressively to
clamp down on classified and unclassified security information.</TE>
<TE>   The administration has restricted--or shut down--access to reams
of material that was readily available before Sept. 11. Dozens of Web
sites with information on nuclear facilities, water treatment
facilities and the like have been closed down; some government
archive records have been destroyed; standards for granting Freedom
of Information Act requests have been toughened; and records on the
detention of terrorism suspects have been kept secret because
officials say the information could help terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   The White House's broadside over the eavesdropping material
underscored what White House spokesman Ari Fleischer described
Thursday as the tension between a culture that places a high value on
the free flow of information and a nation that is ''in the middle of
a war.''</TE>
<TE>   One State Department counter-terrorism analyst, in an opinion
piece published Sunday in the Washington Post, went so far as to
accuse the U.S. media of ''treason'' for publishing numerous stories
on vulnerabilities in U.S. aviation, nuclear facilities and chemical
plants that terrorists could put to deadly use.</TE>
<TE>   Recent opinion polls show the public wants as much information as
it can get on war and terrorism issues without compromising security,
but people are often unsure just where that dividing line is.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the debate has proved a recurring source of tension for
generations--from the time of World War II, when the military warned
that ''loose lips sink ships,'' through the invasion of Grenada
ordered by President Reagan and the Persian Gulf War spearheaded by
Bush's father and Cheney.</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, some critics think the Bush administration has gone
too far.</TE>
<TE>   ''We're seeing unprecedented secrecy,'' said Lucy Dalglish, head
of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press in the Washington
area.</TE>
<TE>   ''When the administration pushes too far ... it's up to the public
and the media to push back and say, 'We're not going to let you make
the unilateral decision on what is appropriate for us to know,' " she
said. ''You don't want to give [terrorists] a road map, but does
anyone seriously think the terrorists don't know we have the ability
to eavesdrop on them?''</TE>
<TE>   At issue are two cryptic communications intercepted by the
top-secret National Security Agency on Sept. 10 from Afghanistan.
Translated the day after the attacks on the World Trade Center and
the Pentagon, the messages said ''tomorrow is zero day'' and ''the
match begins tomorrow,'' sources said. The contents of the NSA
intercepts were first aired Wednesday by CNN and later confirmed and
reported by The Times and other media.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the joint House-Senate panel, along with aides who have
classified clearance, were told of the NSA material some weeks ago.
Congressional sources say members of the panel are eager to find out
why it took two days to translate the messages, but Fleischer said
the more pressing matter is determining how the information got out.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer, while saying that ''we do not know who did it,'' noted
that the NSA information was passed to the intelligence panel in
closed session and that several news accounts cited congressional
sources. ''The president is satisfied it's not coming from his
administration,'' he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has ''very deep concerns about anything that would be
inappropriately leaked ... that could interfere with America's
ability to fight the war on terrorism,'' Fleischer said. That is why
the president had Cheney call the chairmen of the joint panel,
Democratic Sen. Bob Graham and Republican Rep. Porter J. Goss, both
of Florida, Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer recounted that in 1998, after public reports that the
United States was monitoring Osama bin Laden's satellite phone, U.S.
authorities lost any communications from the phone. It is believed
Bin Laden stopped using it.</TE>
<TE>   When Cheney called Graham, the vice president ''was not a happy
man,'' Graham told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney ''emphasized the fact that the administration was
attempting to be cooperative with our investigation, providing us
with a very large amount of material, that the understanding was that
it would be handled with discretion,'' Graham said. He suggested that
Cheney threatened to curb the administration's cooperation if the
leaking did not stop.</TE>
<TE>   After Cheney's tongue-lashing, leaders of the intelligence
committees called meetings to convey the White House's displeasure.</TE>
<TE>   ''This is intolerable,'' said Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco).
''We have called for the investigation and [the leaks] will end.''</TE>
<TE>   Committee members fired off an immediate letter to Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft requesting an investigation. One senior congressional aide,
however, said it was ''ironic'' that the investigation would be
limited to the NSA material and would not include suspicions that the
administration itself has leaked sensitive information when it served
its purposes.</TE>
<TE>   While lawmakers publicly deplored the leaks, privately a
Republican member of the intelligence panel said it was symptomatic
of the Bush administration's overly controlling style of running its
foreign policy.</TE>
<TE>   ''It's a closed shop,'' the Republican panel member said. ''There
is a sense of irritation on the part of the committee.''</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) said Democrats feel shut out. ''We are
an appendage,'' he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hoyer said Bush's secretive style could come back to haunt the
administration, because lawmakers will be less willing to rally
around the White House in times of international trouble if they have
not had a role in developing the policy.</TE>
<TE>   Many Republicans did not know, for instance, that Bush was going
to propose a Department of Homeland Security until the morning of the
announcement.</TE>
<TE>   Members of Congress have also been frustrated that Bush had
refused, until Thursday, to let Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge
testify before Congress. And members of the judiciary committees were
upset that they did not get any advance word of Ashcroft's recent
plan to give the FBI broader rein to pursue terrorism investigations.</TE>
<TE>   For all the tension, some people on Capitol Hill grudgingly accept
the information clampdown.</TE>
<TE>   ''The whole landscape has changed,'' said a congressional aide.
''Certainly a year ago, everyone would have been saying, 'Come on,
what's wrong with getting that information out in the open,' but now
I think everyone realizes that we've got sources and methods to
protect. That's the new world.''</TE>

<HD>Color $20 Bill to Help Put Counterfeiters in Stripes</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Andrew Jackson is in line for a makeover, and we're not
talking wrinkle removal.</LD>
<LD>   The $20 bill, which carries Jackson's image, will get color and
possibly other new features as part of an effort to foil high-tech
counterfeiters. The new 20 could be put into circulation as early as
the fall of 2003, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The $20 bill is the most counterfeited note in the United States
and the second-most commonly used bill behind the $1 bill. Jackson's
last makeover was in 1998.</LD>
<TE>   "Redesigning notes is going to become a way of life for modern
currencies around the world to stay ahead of technology, which is
just exploding and providing increased threats to security," bureau
Director Thomas Ferguson said.</TE>
<TE>   After the new 20 debuts, redesigned $100 bills--which are the most
knocked off outside the country--and $50 bills will follow in 12 to
18 months, the bureau said. But the bureau hasn't decided which of
those notes will roll out first.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's money makers are still deciding whether $5s and
$10s--which were last redesigned in 2000--will get face lifts this
time around.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A celebration of World Refugee Day on Thursday brought together an
unusual diplomatic pair: Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and
actress Angelina Jolie.</LD>
<LD>   Jolie, a United Nations goodwill ambassador, has visited refugee
camps around the world. Thursday, she helped Powell present awards to
four students and cut a ribbon to open an exhibit of pictures,
children's artwork and performances by refugee artists in the main
hall of Union Station.</LD>
<LD>   She praised refugees for their courage despite being uprooted from
home and losing everything.</LD>
<TE>   "Refugees are just like you and me," Jolie said. "They want the
same things we do."</TE>
<TE>   This year's World Refugee Day honors refugee women, who with their
children make up the bulk of the world's 22 million refugees.</TE>
<TE>   "To look into the face of a refugee woman is to peer into the very
eyes of the exodus," Powell said. "They are also the eyes of hope."</TE>

<HD>Polygraphs Given in Utah Kidnap</HD>
<DH>Abduction: Police say they have given tests to people
inside and outside Elizabeth Smart's family. No suspect is yet named.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Police have administered polygraph tests to a number of people inside
and outside 14-year-old Elizabeth Smart's family, authorities said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Sixteen days into the investigation of Elizabeth's apparent
abduction, police say they still have no suspect. The girl reportedly
was taken from her bedroom at gunpoint in the early hours of June 5.</LD>
<LD>   Police Chief Rick Dinse wouldn't elaborate on what the polygraph
tests found.</LD>
<TE>   He also said police have searched the hard drives of 12 computers
and "have found nothing on computers that creates a [link] to this
crime." Police said they examined computers owned by the immediate
family and others.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Scott Atkinson said police had heard that the supermarket
tabloid National Enquirer would report Friday on the family and what
may have been found in the computers. The offices of American Media
Inc., which owns the Enquirer, were closed Thursday evening, and
there was no way to leave a message requesting comment.</TE>
<TE>   FBI agents are looking at other kidnappings, including those of
two teenagers taken from an apartment complex in Oregon and one in
Idaho Falls, Idaho, that ended with the suspect's suicide, said
special agent Dan Roberts. The one in Idaho Falls, which is about 190
miles from Salt Lake City, took place the same morning as the
abduction of Elizabeth.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, police said they were aware of one e-mail ransom
note, but Dinse said they considered it a hoax.</TE>
<TE>   The television show "America's Most Wanted" forwarded the note to
police Wednesday. The note demanded a $50,000 payment by June 17 to
be dropped off at the "Morman" temple, Mann said. "We could
immediately tell it was a hoax," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Police say Elizabeth's 9-year-old sister, who was in the same bed,
described the kidnapper as white, 30 to 40 years old, with dark hair
and hair on his arms and hands.</TE>

<HD>Move Sure to Spare Inmates</HD>
<DH>Courts: The ruling leaves it to the states to define mental
retardation and handle expected appeals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN and LIANNE HART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Convicted killer Johnny Paul Penry, a longtime resident of Texas'
death row, loves coloring books and believes in Santa Claus.</LD>
<LD>   Fellow inmate Doil Lane hates to be without his crayons.</LD>
<LD>   "He sends me pictures all the time," said Austin lawyer William
Allison, who has represented Lane for five years. "Pictures of
firetrucks and flowers and ice-cream trucks. All of his letters start
with the exact same sentence: 'How are you today. I am find [sic].' "</LD>
<TE>   Penry, whose IQ scores range from 50 to 63, and Lane, who
psychiatrists say has the mental capacity of a 6- to 8-year-old, may
have finally won reprieves Thursday when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled
that executing the mentally retarded is cruel and unusual punishment.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling is sure to spare some among the more than 3,700
prisoners on the nation's death rows, although nobody knows for
certain how many.</TE>
<TE>   California has 603 men and women on death row, and the Department
of Corrections says that at least two are "developmentally disabled,"
a category that includes mental retardation as well as autism and
epilepsy. As a result of a federal district court order, the state is
expected to assess the mental capability of all of its death row
inmates by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Some defense attorneys have estimated that as many as 6% of
California's death row prisoners are mentally retarded, but "no one
knows" for sure, said Nathan Barankin, a spokesman for Atty. Gen.
Bill Lockyer.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond saving the lives of some of the condemned, Thursday's
ruling is expected to set off a scramble in 20 states, including
California, that have not previously prohibited the execution of
retarded inmates.</TE>
<TE>   The states will have to define mental retardation and handle what
prosecutors expect will be a deluge of appeals from inmates who claim
that they fit the bill.</TE>
<TE>   "The opinion left it very much in the hands of the states how to
deal with enforcement of this new restriction," said Ward Campbell,
capital case coordinator for the attorney general's office in
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   He predicted a new wave of litigation in death penalty
jurisprudence, causing delays in a system "that already is very
delayed and congested."</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers said it will be up to the state Legislature or the state
Supreme Court to decide the criteria for determining whether an
inmate is mentally retarded.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers already have reason to have clients who they
suspect are mentally impaired undergo tests: Retardation is
considered a mitigating factor for defendants who face a possible
death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, however, inmates conceal their disability from
their lawyers; in others, some attorneys are not especially diligent
in their representation.</TE>
<TE>   No mentally retarded inmate has been executed in California since
1992, 15 years after the death penalty was reinstituted, although
evidence was presented that Robert Alton Harris, who was put to death
in April 1992, had fetal alcohol syndrome, defense lawyers said
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Bills to prohibit the execution of the mentally retarded in
California have failed in part because of opposition from disability
rights groups, which did not want persons with low IQs to be
stigmatized.</TE>
<TE>   States that now ban execution of the mentally retarded don't
always agree on who they are.</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas, for example, says there is a presumption of mental
retardation if an inmate has an IQ of 65 or below, but that
presumption can be rebutted by the prosecution. New Mexico and some
other states set the standard at an IQ of 70 or below.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, this decision will stop the execution of someone,"
said Elisabeth Semel, director of the death penalty clinic at UC
Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law. "The question open to debate is
who is mentally retarded and how is it defined."</TE>
<TE>   Footnotes in Thursday's U.S. Supreme Court opinion suggested that
the high court would find acceptable a definition of mental
retardation that included individuals with an IQ of 70 or below and
maladaptive behaviors that began before the age of 18.</TE>
<TE>   That would exclude death row inmates who are mentally incompetent
because of illness or injuries sustained as an adult.</TE>
<TE>   One of the best-known of such inmates was Rickey Ray Rector, whose
petition for clemency came before Bill Clinton when he was governor
of Arkansas and running for president. Clinton denied the petition
and rushed home from his primary campaign for Rector's execution.</TE>
<TE>   Rector's attorneys argued that the inmate had no concept that
death was permanent. His last actions, they say, prove that they were
right.</TE>
<TE>   Rector ordered pecan pie for his final meal and decided to save
the dessert to eat after his lethal injection.</TE>
<TE>   But Rector was not mentally retarded. He had part of his brain
removed after he shot himself in the head before his final arrest.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are defining retardation as developing before the age of
18, obviously this would not fit," said Jeff Rosenzweig, an attorney
in Little Rock who defended Rector.</TE>
<TE>   Both houses of the Texas Legislature last year passed a bill that
would have barred the execution of mentally retarded inmates, but
Gov. Rick Perry vetoed the bill.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Penry, the U.S. Supreme Court has twice overturned
his death sentence. In the second reversal, the court declared in
2001 that Texas jurors' failure to fully consider his retardation was
a reason to spare him. His murder conviction still stands, and a jury
decided in April that he was competent to assist his defense in a
third hearing on whether he should be sentenced to death.</TE>
<TE>   Texas inmates considered mentally retarded who have been put to
death anyway in recent years include Mario Marquez, 36, who was
executed for killing his estranged wife and her niece. His IQ was 66.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush, who was Texas governor at the time, rejected
Marquez's request for clemency in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Robert McGlasson spoke to his client, Marquez, before he entered
the death chamber. Strapped to a gurney, Marquez told his lawyer: "I
want to be God's gardener and take care of the animals."</TE>
<TE>   McGlasson said Thursday that he eventually learned how to
communicate well with his client.</TE>
<TE>   "If I just pretended I was talking to a boy of 7 or 8 years old,
my communication with him would go a lot more smoothly," McGlasson
said. "He talked about his favorite food and how much he missed his
mommy and daddy even though his parents were very abusive."</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- President Bush selected 12 leaders in arts, sports,
entertainment, politics and newspaper journalism--from Nancy Reagan
to Mister Rogers--for the prestigious Presidential Medal of Freedom.</LD>
<LD>   The medal recipients, announced Thursday at the White House, will
claim the nation's highest civilian honor at a White House ceremony
with the president next month.</LD>
<LD>   Bush is awarding one medal posthumously, to former Washington Post
publisher Katharine Graham, who died last year at 84.</LD>
<TE>   The Medal of Freedom, established by President Truman in 1945 to
recognize civilians for their service during World War II, was
reinstated by President Kennedy in 1963 to honor distinguished
service. Bush will award the medal to:</TE>
<TE>   * Former South African president and Nobel Peace Prize winner
Nelson Mandela.</TE>
<TE>   * Nancy Reagan, the former first lady, saluted by the Bush White
House for her continuing work against drug and alcohol abuse and her
promotion of the Foster Grandparent program.</TE>
<TE>   * Hank Aaron, who began his baseball career in the Negro Leagues
and holds the career records for home runs--755 in his 23-year
career--as well as runs batted in and total bases.</TE>
<TE>   * Bill Cosby, whose 1980s hit "The Cosby Show" revolutionized
television's portrayal of black Americans, the White House said.</TE>
<TE>   * Opera tenor, conductor and arts administrator Placido Domingo.</TE>
<TE>   * Fred Rogers, whose "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood" spanned more
than three decades of public television.</TE>
<TE>   * Graham, "known as an editor who maintained excellence by
supporting her reporters and encouraging those who worked for her,"
the White House said.</TE>
<TE>   * New York Times editor and columnist A.M. Rosenthal.</TE>
<TE>   * Dr. D.A. Henderson, best known for his leadership of the World
Health Organization's global smallpox eradication campaign from 1966
to 1977.</TE>
<TE>   * Intel Corp. co-founder Gordon Moore, who "directed the company's
growth as the most successful developer of the microchip," the White
House said.</TE>
<TE>   * Author, editor and former New York University professor Irving
Kristol, whose writings "helped lay the intellectual groundwork for
the renaissance of conservative ideas in the last half of the 20th
century," the White House said.</TE>
<TE>   * Peter Drucker, whom the White House called "the world's foremost
pioneer of management theory" and a champion of concepts such as
privatization.</TE>

<HD>Crop-Dusting Cut From Sept. 11 Case</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Prosecutors had alleged that Zacarias Moussaoui
studied such planes. Attack fears had prompted groundings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va</DL>
<LD>ALEXANDRIA, Va -- The government has revised its indictment of
accused Sept. 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui, deleting allegations
that he inquired about crop-dusting planes and had information about
them on his computer.</LD>
<LD>   The possibility of crop-dusting attacks was considered so serious
after the Sept. 11 attacks that the planes were grounded temporarily.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. attorney's office, the Justice Department and the FBI
refused to comment on the reason for the deletions in an indictment
that was filed Wednesday and announced Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   The indictment handed down in December said that among possessions
seized from Moussaoui was "a computer disk containing information
related to the aerial application of pesticides."</TE>
<TE>   That allegation was eliminated, as was a second reference: "In or
about June 2001, in Norman, Okla., Zacarias Moussaoui made inquiries
about starting a crop-dusting company."</TE>
<TE>   The Minneapolis FBI office in August had tried to obtain a warrant
to search Moussaoui's computer.</TE>
<TE>   Field agents were turned down by headquarters, prompting an angry
letter in May from agent Coleen Rowley to FBI Director Robert S.
Mueller III about the lack of cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   The discovery of the crop-dusting information was among the
reasons that headquarters' inaction was severely criticized.</TE>
<TE>   The new indictment also deleted a reference that the lead Sept. 11
hijacker, Mohamed Atta, made inquiries about starting a crop-dusting
company at various times in 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Other changes appeared minor, mostly changes in dates and in
amounts of money.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui will be arraigned on the superseding indictment on
Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Eastern Lawmaker Seeks Land Giveaway--in L.A.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHUCK NEUBAUER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A Republican congressman from rural Pennsylvania has introduced
legislation to give away 110 prime acres of national forest around
the Mt. Wilson Observatory to a science institute whose top officers
share his skeptical view of global warming--and whose board includes
his chief of staff.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Forest Service officials estimate the land is worth $100
million. But Rep. John E. Peterson is proposing to give it to the Mt.
Wilson Institute, the nonprofit group that took over operation of the
historic observatory in 1989 after it had been closed for several
years.</LD>
<LD>   The observatory, which once boasted the world's largest reflecting
telescope, is considered by many to be the birthplace of modern
astronomy. It sits atop 5,710-foot Mt. Wilson, a popular hiking spot
in the San Gabriel Mountains near Pasadena.</LD>
<TE>   It is highly unusual for the federal government to give away
valuable land in the middle of a national forest and on a historic
site. It also is rare for an out-of-state congressman to introduce
legislation to give away federal land in someone else's district--in
this case, a Los Angeles-area district that is 2,400 miles from the
rolling hills of the sponsor's northwest Pennsylvania home.</TE>
<TE>   "The bill plays into the hands of those private concerns that
believe that public land is theirs for the taking if they have the
right connections," said Janine Blaeloch, director of the Western
Land Exchange Project, a public interest organization that monitors
federal land exchanges and sales.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson's bill would give the institute 45 acres of Angeles
National Forest land under the observatory. The bill also would give
the institute 65 acres of adjacent parking lots and public facilities
that form the gateway to the observatory. The observatory itself is
not owned by the federal government; it is owned by the Carnegie
Institution of Washington, which founded the observatory and leases
the land from the Forest Service for $1 a year. The Mt. Wilson
Institute operates the facility under an agreement with Carnegie.</TE>
<TE>   The institute is run by some of the nation's leading critics of
the widely held view that global warming is caused by human activity.
The congressman has promoted their work, and he appeared with one of
them on the speaker circuit as recently as Wednesday. He also helped
get $750,000 in federal funds last year for an international solar
research project that the institute spearheaded. His chief of staff,
Robert Ferguson, has been a board trustee for the institute since
April. Since then, he has taken the lead--in his role as
congressional aide--in pushing for the land giveaway.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson also has long been a proponent of restricting federal
land ownership in the West.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson and Ferguson said Ferguson's role at the institute and
Peterson's views on global warming had nothing to do with their
support for the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   A 'Win-Win' Situation</TE>
<TE>   "Was it a favor to them because of global warming? Absolutely
not," said Ferguson, adding that the deal is a "win-win for
everyone." The cash-strapped Forest Service would get out from having
to pay to maintain and protect the site, he said, and the institute
would be able to enhance it with foundation grants.</TE>
<TE>   The Forest Service doesn't "have the resources and expertise to
take care of a national treasure," Ferguson said. He said the
institute has spent $250,000 in the last six years doing work that
should have been done by the Forest Service and that the service had
failed to cut down brush and trees that were a fire hazard, despite
frequent complaints from the institute.</TE>
<TE>   "The place is literally in danger of burning down," Ferguson said.</TE>
<TE>   Forest Service officials have told House staffers that the
institute never told them of their complaints. Gail Wright, a
spokeswoman for the Angeles National Forest, said the Forest Service
is trying to correct the problems identified by the institute.</TE>
<TE>   Wright said they are hoping to resolve the issues without
conveying the land.</TE>
<TE>   Saving Area for Public</TE>
<TE>   At a hearing on the bill Thursday, Tom Thompson, deputy chief of
the National Forest System, said in a statement that the agency
wanted to make sure the area surrounding the observatory "remains
available for public recreational use" and that the conveyance be
"pursued in a fiscally responsible way" that takes into account the
value of the parcel. Thompson said they had not appraised the
property but thought the value was about $1 million an acre.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank), whose district includes Mt.
Wilson, has not made a decision about whether he will support or
oppose Peterson's bill. Schiff said his office learned of the
proposal two weeks ago from Peterson and that his office had not been
contacted by the Mt. Wilson Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson said his office intends to keep pushing to get the land
for the institute.</TE>
<TE>   "The institute has demonstrated that it is best suited to own and
care for the land for the public good," Peterson said at the hearing.
"The use will not change."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview afterward, he said, "If I were king, I would
transfer the land to the Mt. Wilson Institute."</TE>
<TE>   Peterson came up with the idea for conveying the property after
hearing complaints from institute scientists, Ferguson said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the scientists came to Peterson because they know him and
because he has influence with the Forest Service, since he sits on
the resources and appropriations committees that authorize the
agency's budget and oversee its policies. Peterson is vice chairman
of the Resources Subcommittee on Forests and Forest Health, which
held Thursday's hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson said he has actively pushed the legislation for Peterson,
even though he has a position on the institute board. He joined the
board in April at the urging of institute director Robert Jastrow,
whom he described as a personal friend. The House Ethics Manual
cautions members and their staffs to not lobby on behalf of
organizations with which they are affiliated.</TE>
<TE>   "I am working very hard on this," he said. "Pushing the bill is my
job" as chief of staff.</TE>
<TE>   He said that the first thing he tells other federal officials when
discussing the legislation as a congressional staffer is that he also
is a trustee of the institute.</TE>
<TE>   Sidestepping a Conflict</TE>
<TE>   While he has advocated for the bill in Congress, Ferguson said he
thought he had avoided a conflict of interest by recusing himself
from voting on the matter when it came before the institute board.</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson on Thursday said he plans to ask the House ethics
committee for an opinion on whether his dual roles were a problem.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson said Ferguson did not tell him about his trustee position
until Monday, the day the bill was introduced.</TE>
<TE>   "He forgot to tell me about it," said Peterson, who does not see
it as a conflict, because Ferguson is not paid. "If I thought it was
a conflict, I would tell him to get off."</TE>
<TE>   The ties of the institute's leaders to the global warming debate
are strong, as are Peterson's.</TE>
<TE>   Sallie Baliunas, an astrophysicist and the institute's deputy
director, has written a book about global warming. The group's
chairman, Frederick Seitz, and director Jastrow, who founded the NASA
Goddard Institute for Space Studies, also have taken strong public
stands against blaming humans for global warming.</TE>
<TE>   Work Questioned</TE>
<TE>   All three also are active in the George C. Marshall Institute,
which has questioned the work done by other scientists who believe
there are human causes for global warming. The views of the three are
similar to those of Peterson, who wrote in a column distributed by
Knight Ridder: "There is no convincing scientific evidence that
man-made greenhouse gases will cause the demise of planet Earth."</TE>
<TE>   Peterson has entered a proclamation into the Congressional Record
honoring Seitz on his 90th birthday. He has cited Baliunas' work and
appeared on her Web program.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Peterson gave the introduction to a speech to the
conservative Heritage Foundation by Baliunas, who believes that the
human contribution to global warming has been insignificant.</TE>
<TE>   "She was one of the scientists who helped me form my views on this
issue," Peterson said.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson said that he met Baliunas five or six years ago and that
she came to him with the problems the Mt. Wilson Institute was having
with the U.S. Forest Service.</TE>
<TE>   While the institute is run by scientists with conservative views
on global warming, it conducts unrelated atmosphere and space
research at the observatory. Not all scientists who work there are
involved in the global warming debate.</TE>
<TE>   The observatory is where Edwin Hubble discovered there were other
galaxies beyond the Milky Way. For decades, its 100-inch telescope
was the world's largest.</TE>
<TE>   The observatory was founded in 1904 with financing from the
Carnegie Institution. The land was owned by other parties and later
donated to the federal government. Carnegie shut down the telescope
in 1985 but still owns some of the equipment and buildings and holds
a federal lease on the land for 99 more years.</TE>
<TE>   Carnegie officials said they were not consulted about the proposal
to give the land under and around the observatory to the Mt. Wilson
Institute.</TE>
<TE>   The institute now has virtually free use of the land. But Baliunas
said donors have not wanted to sink money into improvements on land
owned by the federal government. The institute hopes to create a
$10-million endowment, including funds for maintaining the property
around the observatory.</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson said that Peterson inserted a clause in the bill that the
land would revert to public ownership if it was not being used for
"scientific, educational, historical and other public purposes."</TE>
<TE>   But Blaeloch of the Western Land Exchange Project said, "This
clause is meaningless in its generality--some could argue Disney
World serves such purposes."</TE>
<TE>   She said the bill follows a familiar pattern for federal land
sales and exchanges that are bad deals for the public.</TE>
<TE>   "Bills like this can pass quickly with no one raising an eyebrow,
and as the session comes to a close, everyone just wants to clear the
decks and go home," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Schiff said his office is assessing the issue. "We would like to
look into problems that the Mt. Wilson Institute has raised in terms
of maintenance, fire risk." At the same time, we want to look at the
details of the proposal ... including conditions for reconveyance.
There are a number of unresolved issues we want to make sure we fully
explore before we make a position."</TE>

<HD>Doctor Sentenced in Illegal Distribution of OxyContin</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DOYLESTOWN, Pa.</DL>
<LD>A doctor accused of dispensing the powerful painkiller OxyContin to
drug addicts and dealers on demand was sentenced Thursday to 30 to
120 years in prison.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Richard G. Paolino, 59, was found guilty in April of forgery,
delivery of a controlled substance and practicing medicine without a
license. He also was convicted on 179 counts of insurance fraud.</LD>
<LD>   He could have received up to life in prison.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities said Paolino was once the primary source of OxyContin
in several Philadelphia neighborhoods. Drug dealers and former
addicts testified Paolino gave them prescriptions for OxyContin on
demand.</TE>
<TE>   OxyContin, a narcotic painkiller meant to last 12 hours, is widely
prescribed for victims of chronic pain. By crushing the medicine and
then snorting or injecting it, abusers can get a quick, heroin-like
high.</TE>
<TE>   The drug has been blamed for the deaths of scores of abusers, many
of them in Appalachia.</TE>
<TE>   Paolino had lost his medical license in 2000 because he had no
malpractice insurance. Prosecutors said he had two other doctors sign
blank prescriptions for him and submitted insurance claims worth
$173,892.</TE>

<DH>Security: Small plane was out of restricted airspace before
F-16 fighters could reach it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>When a single-engine Cessna strayed into restricted airspace near the
White House on Wednesday night, the errant pilot may have exposed a
gap in the post-Sept. 11 protections for the president.</LD>
<LD>   Officials on Thursday downplayed the otherwise harmless incident,
which prompted a partial White House evacuation, although it did not
include President Bush.</LD>
<LD>   But Pentagon officials acknowledged that two F-16 fighters failed
to reach the small aircraft in time to prevent it from crashing into
the White House--had that been the pilot's intention.</LD>
<TE>   The incident raised questions about the adequacy of the restricted
airspace over downtown Washington. Some suggested that the space
should be expanded, and that perhaps full-time combat patrols should
be deployed over the capital, as occurred immediately after the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
Those patrols were discontinued this year.</TE>
<TE>   But White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer dismissed such
concerns, saying that "multiple levels of protection" were in place
for the executive mansion. He refused to provide details, such as
whether antiaircraft guns were positioned atop the White House--long
a local legend.</TE>
<TE>   "There was never a threat to the president," he said of
Wednesday's incident.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, even as reporters in the West Wing and construction
workers on the South Lawn were ordered to leave the grounds, Secret
Service agents inside the White House opted not to disturb Bush and
his wife, Laura.</TE>
<TE>   The Bushes, who had returned moments earlier from a Republican
fund-raiser across town, were not told of the potential threat, which
was briefly declared after the small aircraft entered restricted
airspace just before 8 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason the president was neither told nor moved was because
the judgment was made, accurately so, that the plane did not pose a
threat," Fleischer said. "I think it's fair to say that, if the plane
had continued on a different course or taken any different action
from what the Secret Service knew it was taking, the Secret Service
would have done differently."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the agency intends to "reevaluate" its procedures in
light of the incident, spokesman Brian Marr said.</TE>
<TE>   The ever-present concerns about the security of the White
House--and its chief occupant--assumed new urgency after the
terrorist attacks, in part because hijackers of a fourth commercial
jetliner that crashed in western Pennsylvania may have been targeting
the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's incident was not the day's only scare in the capital.
Several hours earlier and only a few blocks away, a suspicious
package prompted the evacuation of the Federal Reserve, leading to
massive gridlock downtown at the start of afternoon rush hour.</TE>
<TE>   And at the GOP fund-raiser, some reporters traveling with Bush
found an unspent round of ammunition on the ground not far from where
he had spoken. The cartridge was believed to have been lost by a law
enforcement official and was turned over to the Secret Service, which
is investigating.</TE>
<TE>   The airplane incident, described by the FBI as a "navigational
error," began when the single-engine Cessna 182 approached the
so-called temporary flight-restricted zone over Washington while
trying to avoid bad weather during a flight from Gardner, Mass., to
Raleigh, N.C., officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The zone, set up after Sept. 11, bars private planes from flying
within 15 miles of the Washington Monument, just across from the
White House's South Lawn, at altitudes below 18,000 feet. The Cessna
not only penetrated the southeast portion of the restricted zone but
at one point flew at 10,500 feet.</TE>
<TE>   When the pilot did not respond immediately to the control tower at
Washington's Reagan National Airport, officials there alerted several
federal agencies, including the Federal Aviation Administration and
the North American Aerospace Defense Command.</TE>
<TE>   Officials scrambled two F-16s from nearby Andrews Air Force Base
in suburban Maryland, the home of Air Force One. But by the time they
reached the Cessna, the pilot already had contacted air
controllers--for a weather update--and left the restricted zone after
an estimated 12-minute intrusion. The closest the plane got to the
White House was four miles, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   When the F-16s reached the scene, the pilots established radio
contact with the Cessna pilot and remained in communication to
Richmond, Va. The Cessna landed there about 8:50 p.m. Officials did
not release the names of the pilot or the lone passenger. They were
questioned, found to be cooperative and released. The travelers took
off Thursday morning from Richmond.</TE>
<TE>   Within the temporary flight restriction zone is a so-called
prohibited airspace area called P-56, covering a rectangular area
roughly from the Lincoln Memorial to the Capitol. The Cessna did not
enter that space, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials acknowledged that the incident highlighted the
fact that fighter jets cannot necessarily arrive in time to stop a
plane from reaching the airspace over the White House.</TE>
<TE>   The only way to ensure full protection for the White House from
the air is to expand the no-fly zone and perhaps deploy
round-the-clock combat patrols, a senior defense official said.</TE>
<TE>   The F-16s reacted within the required 15-minute response time
after being alerted by the FAA, said Maj. Barry Venable, a spokesman
for the defense command.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's incident was handled in such a low-key fashion
upstairs at the White House residence that the president only learned
about it Thursday morning, when briefed by an aide.</TE>
<TE>   The vulnerability of the White House to an attack by a light
aircraft was demonstrated in 1994, when a troubled Maryland man,
Frank Corder, flew a stolen Cessna into a magnolia tree just outside
President Clinton's bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   Corder was killed, but no one else was injured.</TE>

<HD>S.C. Governor Loses His Bid to Stop Plutonium Shipments</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>COLUMBIA, S.C.</DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court Thursday rejected Gov. Jim Hodges'
last-minute attempt to stop plutonium shipments from entering South
Carolina.</LD>
<LD>   Hodges had sought an order barring the shipments while he appeals
a ruling allowing them. The federal shipments from the Rocky Flats
facility in Colorado to the Savannah River Site in Aiken could begin
as early as Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Also Thursday, the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed to
expedite Hodges' case, setting oral arguments for July 10.</LD>
<TE>   "While I am disappointed the court is letting the Department of
Energy ship plutonium into South Carolina this Saturday, I am
encouraged by the court's decision to hear our case so quickly,"
Hodges said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said he would continue to work
with South Carolina's congressional delegation on the terms of the
plutonium program.</TE>
<TE>   The governor has appealed a federal judge's ruling that he didn't
present enough evidence that the shipments or long-term storage at
Savannah River would harm the public.</TE>
<TE>   If Hodges is able to win his case in July, the state would be able
to prevent everything but a "small amount of their shipments," said
his lawyer, William Want.</TE>
<TE>   The Energy Department wants to move about 6 tons of plutonium to
the Savannah River Site, about 20 miles east of Augusta, Ga., as part
of the agency's effort to clean up and close Rocky Flats.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials say the material will be converted at Savannah
River into fuel for nuclear reactors. But Hodges fears the conversion
program might never be funded and that the plutonium might be stored
permanently in his state.</TE>

<HD>Democrats Attack Item in Bush's Security Plan</HD>
<DH>Politics: Ridge gives long-awaited testimony before
Congress. Lawmakers oppose a provision sidestepping civil service
regulations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON and RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In the first flash of partisan dissent from President Bush's homeland
security plan, Democrats on Thursday assailed a provision that could
allow leaders of the proposed Cabinet agency to bypass federal
personnel rules that protect civil servants.</LD>
<LD>   The Democratic criticism emerged as Tom Ridge, Bush's point man on
homeland security, appeared before House and Senate committees to
give his first formal testimony to Congress since he came to
Washington last fall to help improve domestic defenses against
terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Ridge, a former congressman and governor of Pennsylvania, received
a warm reception. So did most of the administration's plan to
consolidate several agencies scattered across the government into one
Department of Homeland Security.</LD>
<TE>   But Democratic criticism on the civil service issue showed the
2-week-old proposal is entering a tough phase as Congress begins
debating how to turn it into law.</TE>
<TE>   While most lawmakers have voiced general support for Bush's push
to fold 169,000 employees into a new department meant to counter
terrorism and other domestic threats, Democrats zeroed in on a
little-publicized provision of the draft bill the administration sent
to Congress this week.</TE>
<TE>   The provision would allow the secretary of Homeland Security and
White House personnel officials to replace existing civil service
regulations with a merit-based management system.</TE>
<TE>   The existing rules aim to shield career government employees from
political influence, granting many of them collective bargaining
rights and other protections.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush proposal is fiercely opposed by two unions that represent
roughly 50,000 of the affected federal workers: the American
Federation of Government Employees and the National Treasury
Employees Union. Now Democratic allies are coming to their defense.</TE>
<TE>   ''There is unanimous [Democratic] opposition to the
administration's proposal to circumvent the civil service laws of the
country, as they are contemplating,'' Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.) said.</TE>
<TE>   ''We can't do that. We're not going to rewrite or totally exempt
this or any federal agency from the laws pertaining to civil
service.''</TE>
<TE>   A More 'Agile' Agency</TE>
<TE>   Ridge, in written testimony, defended the administration's
initiative as an attempt to develop a ''motivated, high-performance
and accountable workforce.''</TE>
<TE>   Under questioning from the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee,
he added that Bush wants to ''make the agency a lot more agile and
give it some of the tools that it may need to deal with ... personnel
challenges.''</TE>
<TE>   In a subsequent hearing held by the House Government Reform
Committee, Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo) told Ridge that Democrats
consider civil service protections for federal employees
''non-negotiable.''</TE>
<TE>   Ridge also faced questions on how the proposed executive shake-up
would address intelligence lapses that occurred before the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In one sharp exchange, Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) grilled Ridge on
why Bush's plan would not require that the Department of Homeland
Security be given access to certain intelligence related to terrorist
threats.</TE>
<TE>   ''It seems to me that it leaves the problem, the gaps, the cracks
unanswered,'' Levin said, ''because right now we have a situation
where the CIA and the FBI and other agencies do not share data. It's
not integrated. The dots are not connected.''</TE>
<TE>   Ridge said Bush wants the department to get enough relevant
intelligence to ''enhance our ability as a country to identify
threats and be prepared to act on them.''</TE>
<TE>   He conceded that ''perhaps then we need to work on the language''
in the draft bill.</TE>
<TE>   At the House committee hearing, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los
Angeles) complained that the reorganization plan ''doesn't address
the most pressing security questions that we confront''--citing
struggles in getting important intelligence related to terrorism into
the right hands.</TE>
<TE>   'Working in Secret'</TE>
<TE>   Waxman also complained that the White House proposal was put
together by a ''handful of political appointees working in secret.''</TE>
<TE>   Ridge appeared at ease during his appearances before the
committees, which came months after lawmakers from both major parties
began urging the president to allow him to testify.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, Bush had cited executive prerogative in keeping
Ridge off the formal stage on Capitol Hill.</TE>
<TE>   But Ridge, after Bush's June 6 announcement of the proposed
reorganization, became the top salesman for the plan.</TE>
<TE>   With Ridge assuming that role, Bush reversed position and allowed
him to testify.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), chairman of the Senate panel,
said Ridge's appearance was ''long-awaited, much-pursued, greatly
anticipated.'' Ridge, chuckling, acknowledged: ''There's been some
pent-up interest in my testimony.''</TE>

<HD>Execution Abolished for Mentally Retarded</HD>
<DH>Supreme Court: Six justices back a 'national consensus'
that the practice is cruel and unusual. The ruling draws an angry
dissent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court on Thursday declared an end to the execution of
convicted murderers who are mentally retarded, saying the nation has
reached a consensus that it is cruel and unusual to put to death a
person with the mental age of a child.</LD>
<LD>   Eighteen states that impose the death penalty have passed new laws
exempting prisoners who are retarded, the court said. In the last
decade, only five states--most notably Texas--have executed killers
whose IQs measured 70 or less, the standard threshold for defining
retardation.</LD>
<LD>   "The practice, therefore, has become truly unusual," said Justice
John Paul Stevens, speaking for the court.</LD>
<TE>   It is also cruel, he said, since those with a diminished mental
capacity are more likely to act on impulse and less likely to
consider the consequences.</TE>
<TE>   The ultimate punishment of death should be reserved for the worst
of murderers, Stevens said. Since retarded people are less culpable
for their acts of violence, they must be "categorically excluded"
from capital punishment, he concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's 6-3 ruling extends to all of the 3,701 inmates
condemned to death around the nation, as well as to future cases.
California has by far the nation's largest death row, with 603
inmates. A state prosecutor predicted that very few of them will be
spared by the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Antonin Scalia read an angry dissent in the courtroom,
accusing his colleagues of adopting the "arrogant assumption ...
[that they] have moral sentiments superior to those of the common
herd."</TE>
<TE>   He mocked the "empty talk of a national consensus" on the issue
and predicted that the ruling will cause chaos.</TE>
<TE>   "The symptoms [of retardation] can be feigned ....This will turn
the process of a capital trial into a game," he said. Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist and Justice Clarence Thomas joined his dissent.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens said the court was reluctant to define mental retardation
and left that task to experts, trial judges and state legislators.</TE>
<TE>   However, his opinion relied on the standard used by the American
Psychiatric Assn. and the American Assn. on Mental Retardation. These
groups define mental retardation as a "significant sub-average
general intellectual functioning." Typically, "mild" mental
retardation describes people whose IQ level is measured from 50 to
70.</TE>
<TE>   This intellectual deficiency must be combined with a limited
"adaptive function" at home, at school or at work. "The onset [of
these difficulties] must occur before age 18," the psychiatric
association said.</TE>
<TE>   This definition appears to exclude people whose mental ability
declines sharply while in prison. But the uncertainty of who is
retarded and how it is be measured will likely spawn a series of
legal battles in the lower courts.</TE>
<TE>   However, the high court's opinion is firm in saying that once an
inmate has been judged to be mentally retarded, the state may not
impose a death sentence. James Ellis, a law professor at the
University of New Mexico who successfully argued Thursday's case on a
behalf of a Virginia inmate, Daryl Atkins, said "there aren't any
good numbers" for how many inmates may be affected by the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   While some legal experts have estimated that up to 10% of the
inmates on state death rows are retarded, state prosecutors say they
believe the number is much smaller.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, the Supreme Court ruled that judges and jurors must
consider mental retardation as a "mitigating factor" during a
sentencing hearing, a reason to spare the life of the convicted
murderer.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, many prosecutors do not seek a death sentence if the
accused is retarded.</TE>
<TE>   California does not by law exclude mentally retarded defendants
from capital punishment, but state prosecutors say they do not
believe many such individuals are on death row now.</TE>
<TE>   "In sheer numbers, very few [of California's death row inmates]
will be affected" by the ruling, said Dane Gillette, a California
assistant attorney general who coordinates the capital cases. "But I
suspect quite a few will file claims raising the issue. I think we
will see a new interest in being tested."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1991, according to Amnesty International, 12 people whose
IQs tested at 70 or below--or who were borderline mentally
retarded--have been executed in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   William F. Schulz, the group's executive director, said Thursday's
ruling "has finally ushered the United States into the circle of
civilized nations when it comes to such executions.... Our justice
system has now caught up with the moral sensibilities of the American
people."</TE>
<TE>   He referred to opinion surveys showing that, although most
Americans support the death penalty, they oppose the execution of
mentally retarded individuals by an overwhelming margin.</TE>
<TE>   But the case decided Thursday, Daryl Atkins vs. Virginia, 00-8452,
also illustrates the difficulty of the issue.</TE>
<TE>   On an August evening in 1996, Atkins and a friend had been
drinking when they walked to a convenience store intending to rob a
customer. They spotted Eric Nesbitt, an airman at Langley Air Force
Base. Atkins put a gun to him, took control of his truck and drove
him to a bank machine. After forcing Nesbitt to withdraw $200, Atkins
drove him to a field and shot him eight times.</TE>
<TE>   The jury, which relied on the co-conspirator's testimony,
convicted Atkins of the murder. At the sentencing hearing, jurors
also were told of 16 other crimes that Atkins had committed,
including robberies and assaults.</TE>
<TE>   A defense expert who tested Atkins said his IQ was 59, that he had
fared poorly in school and that he was retarded. A state psychologist
who interviewed Atkins disagreed and described him as being of
"average intelligence." The jury then sentenced him to death.</TE>
<TE>   The Virginia Supreme Court accepted that he had a very low IQ
score but upheld his sentence. He remains on death row while the
state assesses the court's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's ruling reverses that decision and says evidence of
retardation calls for a long prison term, not a death sentence.
However, the opinion leaves open the possibility that Virginia's
lawyers could try to show that Atkins is not mentally retarded.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, President Bush raised eyebrows when he told a group of
foreign visitors that he opposed the execution of mentally retarded
people, even though several convicts with very low IQs were executed
when he was governor of Texas. In 1997, Terry Washington, whose IQ
tested between 58 and 69, was executed in Texas.</TE>
<TE>   The president's aides explained that Bush believed the standard
was whether a defendant knew right from wrong when he committed his
crime. Judges use this standard to decide whether a person is
competent to stand trial, but it is not often used as a test of
mental retardation.</TE>
<TE>   The current governors of Texas and Oklahoma have vetoed bills that
would have exempted retarded defendants by citing that standard.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating vetoed a bill to exempt
the mentally retarded from death sentences and said the state's laws
are adequate. Those who "cannot differentiate right from wrong" are
spared already, he said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Justice Stevens' opinion rejects the "right from wrong"
standard as the definition for mental retardation.</TE>
<TE>   California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer praised the court's ruling and
said he will try to implement it fairly and responsibly.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's ruling marks the fourth time that justices have
announced a categorical exclusion from executions.</TE>
<TE>   In 1977, the year after they restored capital punishment, the
justices barred death sentences for rapists and others whose crimes
stopped short of murder. In the South at that time, a significant
number of inmates facing death were not charged with murder.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, the court exempted those who are insane. In 1989, the
court excluded juveniles who were younger than 16 when they committed
a murder.</TE>
<TE>   That same year, the court stopped just short of ending the death
penalty for mentally retarded inmates in the case of Johnny Paul
Penry. Four liberal justices said such executions are cruel and
unusual punishment, which is banned by the 8th Amendment. Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor voted to reverse Penry's death sentence but said
there was not yet a national consensus for banning such executions.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   That day came Thursday, as O'Connor voted with the majority to end
the practice.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Priest Indicted in Abuse Cases</HD>
<DH>Courts: Paul Shanley faces multiple counts of child rape
and assault in the Boston area.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAMBRIDGE, Mass.</DL>
<LD>A central figure in the sex abuse scandal in the Boston Archdiocese
was indicted Thursday on multiple counts of child rape and indecent
assault for allegedly abusing four boys.</LD>
<LD>   The allegations against retired Roman Catholic priest Paul Shanley
span from 1979 to 1989, when he was at St. Jean's parish in Newton, a
suburb of Boston. The indictment, the first against Shanley, includes
10 counts of child rape and six counts of indecent assault and
battery.</LD>
<LD>   "In an ideal world, we would not have sexual abuse of children,"
prosecutor Martha Coakley said.</LD>
<TE>   Shanley's attorney, Frank Mondano, said the indictments came as no
surprise. He had not seen them as of Thursday evening, but said his
client would fight the charges.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Shanley would take one of the boys, who is now
24, out of classes and abuse him in the rectory, the bathroom of the
church and a confessional.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Roderick MacLeish, who represents the alleged victims,
said three of them were in the same catechism class at St. Jean's.
The fourth doesn't know the others, he said. "Were it not for the
statute of limitations in Massachusetts for child rape, there would
be many, many more prosecutions," MacLeish said.</TE>
<TE>   Shanley, 71, has been jailed since May when he was arrested and
returned from California to face three counts of child rape, which
were included in Thursday's indictment. He has pleaded not guilty to
those charges and was being held on $300,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   "These latest revelations will undoubtedly open up the deep and
painful wounds of those who have been abused in the past," Cardinal
Bernard Law said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   He added: "My sorrow is compounded whenever such acts involve the
betrayal of trust by a priest. For this I apologize from the bottom
of my heart."</TE>
<TE>   Shanley became a key figure in the scandal earlier this year when
the archdiocese released personnel files indicating that church
officials had received complaints about Shanley dating to 1967.</TE>

<HD>Smallpox Vaccine Recommended for Emergency Teams Only</HD>
<DH>Health: While the threat remains low, experts initially OK
access to vaccinations for officials who would respond to an attack
using the virus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A panel of U.S. health experts on Thursday recommended smallpox
vaccinations for the roughly 20,000 health-care workers who would be
the first to respond to a deadly bioterrorist attack but stopped far
short of making the vaccine available to all Americans.</LD>
<LD>   The step, if accepted by Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy
G. Thompson, would mark the first time in three decades that anyone
outside a tiny number of scientists and laboratory workers would have
access to the vaccine.</LD>
<LD>   Thompson said in a statement Thursday that, while the threat of a
smallpox attack is believed to be low, "unfortunately we now live in
a world where we need to be prepared for the possibility of such a
biological attack."</LD>
<TE>   He said he would move "as expeditiously as possible" to set a new
policy, which might also be reviewed by the White House.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government stopped routinely vaccinating against the
disfiguring and highly lethal disease in 1972--23 years after the
last case on U.S. soil. By 1978, smallpox had been eradicated
worldwide, and now the only known samples of the virus are held by
government officials in the U.S. and Russia.</TE>
<TE>   For years, terrorism experts have expressed concern about the
security of samples held by the Russians, saying they cannot rule out
the possibility the virus could fall into the hands of individuals
who would use it in a bioterrorist attack. Without widespread
immunizations, such an attack could be devastating, experts have
warned.</TE>
<TE>   In light of the perceived threat, top federal health officials
moved aggressively last fall to acquire enough vaccine for each
American by the end of this year. Thursday's recommendation on how to
use the new stockpile came at the close of a two-day meeting in
Atlanta of the 15-member Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices, which sets vaccine policy for the nation. In a series of
discussions, doctors, scientists and other health-care experts
weighed the dangers of administering the vaccine against the chance
of an outbreak.</TE>
<TE>   In a unanimous vote, ACIP members concluded the vaccine should be
available on a voluntary basis for an estimated 10,000 to 20,000
people who make up bioterrorism response teams assigned to handle any
suspected smallpox cases. It is the narrowest population under
consideration.</TE>
<TE>   Under the federal bioterrorism response plan, each state is
required to have at least one such team, with more to be created
depending on need.</TE>
<TE>   Those who would be eligible to get the vaccine fall into two
groups: public health officials who would have to investigate any
suspected cases and organize quarantines and vaccinations, and
hospital workers at locations designated to handle an outbreak.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said that working out how to implement the
recommendation, if it becomes policy, would likely take until the
fall at the earliest.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, federal health officials engaged the public in
the debate over vaccination policy, which moved to the forefront of
concerns after Sept. 11 and the subsequent anthrax attacks that
killed five people and sickened at least 13 others.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts have expressed concern that the strategy of
quarantines and vaccinations that succeeded in eradicating the
disease in the last century might not be effective against a
modern-day bioterrorist attack. But the advisory panel expressed
confidence in the strategy as they recommended that only a relatively
small group of "emergency responders" be vaccinated.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. John Modlin, the committee chairman and a Dartmouth Medical
School professor, said the recommendation "appropriately balances"
the risks of the vaccine against the likelihood of a smallpox
outbreak.</TE>
<TE>   The smallpox vaccine is a live form of the virus known as
vaccinia, and it requires informed consent from anyone who takes it.
It remains more dangerous than routine vaccinations, cautioned Dr.
Julie Gerberding, the acting deputy director of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, it is possible for those who are freshly vaccinated
to transmit vaccinia to others.</TE>
<TE>   Experts estimate 300 people would die of a severe reaction if
every American was vaccinated. They acknowledge, however, that the
estimate is based on 40 year-old data that do not take into account
people with compromised immune systems, such as those with HIV or
AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   Gerberding said she would caution individuals who wished to take
the vaccine that it has "special risks."</TE>
<TE>   "It is not as safe as the vaccines we ordinarily recommend," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Committee members said that the issue may be revisited if there is
a greater risk of an attack.</TE>

<HD>Research Offers Alternative to Embryo Stem Cells</HD>
<DH>Science: Cells found in adult bone marrow may provide cures
for disease. Opponents of destroying human embryos applaud the
discovery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AARON ZITNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A Minnesota researcher says she has found a previously unknown type
of cell in the adult body that acts much like the highly versatile
stem cells from human embryos that have caused a political furor for
more than a year.</LD>
<LD>   Like embryonic stem cells, the cells recently discovered in adult
bone marrow seem capable of turning into a wide assortment of the
body's various tissues, raising hopes that they can be fashioned into
transplantable material for patients whose own cells and tissues have
become faulty. Previously, scientists had documented other cells of
the adult body that give rise to various tissues, but nothing nearly
as versatile as these bone marrow cells.</LD>
<LD>   The cells were discovered by University of Minnesota researcher
Dr. Catherine Verfaillie and colleagues, who revealed new details
Thursday in an online version of the journal Nature.</LD>
<TE>   Antiabortion groups said that the discovery shows scientists
should try to devise cures for disease using adult cells and that
they do not need to use embyronic stem cells, which cannot be
obtained without destroying human embryos.</TE>
<TE>   ''With adult cells, we may be able to do everything that embryonic
stem cells have been proposed for, and without the ethical
problems,'' said Richard Doerflinger, a spokesman for the U.S.
Conference of Catholic Bishops, which believes embryo destruction is
tantamount to murder. ''This shows you don't have to forgo scientific
progress when you take into account moral issues.''</TE>
<TE>   Verfaillie and an array of other scientists said adult and
embryonic stem cells show promise and should be vigorously
investigated.</TE>
<TE>   ''There may be particular diseases that would be more easily
treatable with one cell type than the other,'' Verfaillie said.
''These studies should go on in parallel.''</TE>
<TE>   As evidence, she and others cited a second paper published by
Nature on Thursday in which scientists used embryonic stem cells to
ease the symptoms of Parkinson's disease in rats.</TE>
<TE>   These scientists, led by Ron McKay of the National Institutes of
Health, turned embryonic stem cells from mice into a specific type of
brain cell before transplanting them into the rats.</TE>
<TE>   Transforming stem cells in this way has been largely a hit-or-miss
process. But the team said it had developed a method to transform the
cells reliably and in high numbers, suggesting that it could one day
be industrialized to serve a large number of patients.</TE>
<TE>   ''We can really deliver the right cell that we need by starting
with an embryonic stem cell,'' McKay said. ''This is a real
technology now. It's not just fooling around.''</TE>
<TE>   Several scientists said that the experiment was one of the most
dramatic illustrations of the potential of embryonic stem cells to
treat disease but that cures were still uncertain and years away.</TE>
<TE>   Once an arcane debate, the relative promise of adult and embryonic
stem cells has become politically charged in recent years. The goal
is to turn these cells into heart cells for cardiac patients, brain
cells for Alzheimer's patients, insulin-producing cells for
diabetics, and the like.</TE>
<TE>   Many scientists say that stem cells from embryos are best for the
task. The cells are usually taken from embryos, about 5 days of age,
that were created in laboratory dishes by fertility patients but are
no longer needed. Taking the cells destroys the embryos.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of embryo research say scientists should first study the
potential of creating these materials from stem cells found in
adults.</TE>
<TE>   Citing ethics concerns, President Bush last year barred federal
funding for experiments that caused embryos to be destroyed, though
he said stem cells taken from embryos before August could be used in
taxpayer-funded experiments. This year, Congress is considering
whether to criminalize cloning research, which also destroys embryos.</TE>
<TE>   Verfaillie has found the versatile cells, called MAPCs, or
multipotent adult progenitor cells, in the bone marrow of humans and
other species. The first indications of her discovery were published
last fall.</TE>
<TE>   But in the report published Thursday, she used a more definitive
test to show that the cells are truly versatile. In this test, MAPCs
from mice were injected into mouse embryos. As the embryos matured,
the MAPCs incorporated themselves into almost every organ of the
body.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Robert Goldstein, chief scientific officer at the Juvenile
Diabetes Research Foundation International, said Verfaillie had made
a ''pretty convincing'' case for the versatility of the MAPCs.</TE>
<TE>   But Larry Goldstein, a stem cell researcher at UC San Diego, said
that Verfaillie would have made a stronger case if she had shown that
the MAPCs were actually functioning in the mice and if they were
found in higher numbers.</TE>
<TE>   ''This is interesting. It's provocative....But it's not quite
there, I'd say,'' he said.</TE>
<TE>   One question is whether versatile MAPCs exist in the body or if
Verfaillie created them unintentionally during the process of
isolating and culturing them in laboratory dishes. The answer is
important, though, either way, the cells could be useful in designing
treatments for patients.</TE>
<TE>   McKay and his team set out to turn mouse embryonic stem cells into
a type of brain cell that produces the chemical dopamine. For unknown
reasons, these brain cells die in Parkinson's patients, and the lack
of dopamine leads to tremors, instability and other symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   The team said it could get nearly 80% of the embryonic stem cells
to become dopamine-producing cells, compared with only a few percent
in the past. The remaining cells were undesirable cell types.
Obtaining a purified population of the brain cells is important,
because scientists do not want to transplant undesired cells to
patients.</TE>
<TE>   McKay's team tested its cells in rats. Chemicals were used to
destroy dopamine neurons on one side of the brain, mimicking
Parkinson's disease in that region. As a result, the rats would walk
in a circle, as if they were boats being rowed by a single oar.</TE>
<TE>   Transplanting dopamine neurons improved the rats' walking, McKay's
team reported. ''What impresses me is that not only did he get these
cells to survive but they sent out extensions to form connections
with other neurons in the brain,'' said Jeffrey Kordower of
Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   McKay said the next step is to repeat the experiment in monkeys,
which would take several years.</TE>

<HD>Excerpts From Execution Decision</HD>
<DH>THE SUPREME COURT</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Excerpts from Thursday's Supreme Court decision on the execution of
the mentally retarded:</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "Those mentally retarded persons who meet the law's requirements
for criminal responsibility should be tried and punished when they
commit crimes. Because of their disabilities in areas of reasoning,
judgment, and control of their impulses, however, they do not act
with the level of moral culpability that characterizes the most
serious adult criminal conduct." -- Justice John Paul Stevens for the
majority</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Moreover, their impairments can jeopardize the reliability and
fairness of capital proceedings against mentally retarded
defendants." -- Stevens</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Not only does it ... find no support in the text or history of
the Eighth Amendment; it does not even have support in current social
attitudes regarding the conditions that render an otherwise just
death penalty inappropriate." -- Justice Antonin Scalia, dissenting</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Seldom has an opinion of this Court rested so obviously upon
nothing but the personal views of its members." -- Scalia</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "It is not so much the number of these states that is significant,
but the consistency of the direction of the change. The practice ...
has become unusual, and it is fair to say that a national consensus
has developed against it." -- Stevens</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Mentally retarded defendants may be less able to give meaningful
assistance to their counsel and are typically poor witnesses, and
their demeanor may create an unwarranted impression of lack of
remorse for their crimes." -- Stevens</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "We are not persuaded that the execution of mentally retarded
criminals will measurably advance the deterrent or the retributive
purpose of the death penalty." -- Stevens</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The Court pays lip service to these precedents as it miraculously
extracts a 'national consensus' forbidding execution of the mentally
retarded.... If one is to say, as the Court does today, that all
executions of the mentally retarded are so morally repugnant as to
violate our national 'standards of decency,' surely the 'consensus'
it points to must be one that has set its righteous face against all
such executions." -- Scalia</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "I agree with Justice Scalia ... that the Court's assessment of
the current legislative judgment regarding the execution of
defendants like petitioner more resembles a post hoc rationalization
for the majority's subjectively preferred result rather than any
objective effort to ascertain the content of an evolving standard of
decency." -- Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, dissenting</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "In my view, these two sources--the work product of legislatures
and sentencing jury determinations--ought to be the sole indicators
by which courts ascertain the contemporary American conceptions of
decency for purposes of the Eighth Amendment. They are the only
objective indicia of contemporary values firmly supported by our
precedents." -- Rehnquist</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "To further buttress its appraisal of contemporary societal
values, the Court marshals public opinion poll results and evidence
that several professional organizations and religious groups have
adopted official positions opposing the imposition of the death
penalty upon mentally retarded offenders.... In my view, none should
be accorded any weight on the Eighth Amendment scale when the elected
representatives of a State's populace have not deemed them persuasive
enough to prompt legislative action." -- Rehnquist</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The theory of deterrence in capital sentencing is predicated upon
the notion that the increased severity of the punishment will inhibit
criminal actors from carrying out murderous conduct. Yet it is the
same cognitive and behavioral impairments that make these defendants
less morally culpable--for example, the diminished ability to
understand and process information, to learn from experience, to
engage in logical reasoning, or to control impulses--that also make
it less likely that they can process the information of the
possibility of execution as a penalty and, as a result, control their
conduct based upon that information." -- Stevens</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Construing and applying the Eighth Amendment in the light of our
'evolving standards of decency,' we therefore conclude that such
punishment is excessive and that the Constitution 'places a
substantive restriction on the States' power to take the life' of a
mentally retarded offender." -- Stevens</TE>

<HD>Study Links Warming to Epidemics</HD>
<DH>Science: The survey lists species hit by outbreaks and
suggests that humans are also in peril.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A wide-ranging survey of world ecosystems shows that warmer
temperatures have sparked a host of epidemics in plants and animals,
suggesting that global warming could ravage the planet's ecology and
accelerate disease in a number of species--including our own.</LD>
<LD>   The study is a litany of species--oysters, oaks, monarch
butterflies and colorful Hawaiian forest birds called
honeycreepers--that have succumbed in recent years to new or more
virulent disease outbreaks due to even small increases in
temperature.</LD>
<LD>   Although many of the deaths were related to short-term temperature
spikes from phenomena such as El Nino, scientists said the findings
bolster theories that long-term global warming could usher in similar
devastation--and on a much broader scale.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not only going to be a warmer world, it's going to be a
sicker world," said Andrew Dobson, an epidemiologist at Princeton
University and co-author of the report published in today's issue of
Science.</TE>
<TE>   Almost everywhere the authors looked--on land and sea, in tropical
climes and temperate ones--they found examples of plants and animals
falling prey to disease as temperatures rose.</TE>
<TE>   "When you see the same pattern across so many organisms, you need
to start taking the climate signal seriously," said Richard S.
Ostfeld, an ecologist at the Institute of Ecosystem Studies in
Millbrook, N.Y. "We don't want to be alarmist, but we are alarmed."</TE>
<TE>   The link between global warming and disease has been controversial
since it was first proposed in 1991. Many critics argue that such
concerns are overblown since a connection has yet to be firmly
established. The problem has proved to be maddeningly difficult to
analyze because of the multitude of factors, such as pollution and
habitat destruction, that play major roles in the spread of disease.</TE>
<TE>   The most contentious aspect of the debate has been the effect of
warming on human epidemics, which are far more difficult to dissect
because they involve a range of factors such as sanitation and
vaccination.</TE>
<TE>   The new paper sidesteps that debate somewhat by focusing largely
on wild plants and animals that aren't subject to a public health
infrastructure. But its implication is clear that humans are at risk
too. "The mechanisms that cause malaria to be transmitted to
honeycreepers are exactly the same mechanisms that transmit malaria
to children," Dobson said.</TE>
<TE>   The authors chronicle a variety of ways that warmer temperatures
could fuel the severity and proliferation of disease. Warm nights and
shorter winters allow the fungus that causes Dutch elm disease to
thrive. Higher temperatures have allowed malaria-carrying mosquitoes
to invade higher elevations, leading to more malaria deaths in
mountain-dwelling Hawaiian songbirds. Ligurian Sea sponges that
suffer heat stress in warmer waters are more vulnerable to fatal
infection.</TE>
<TE>   The authors also included examples in which warm temperatures
could lead to less disease. These include a number of diseases in
fish, insects and amphibians that spread only in cool conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems clear the importance of temperature is pretty
overwhelming," said Drew Harvell, a Cornell University marine
ecologist and lead author of the study.</TE>
<TE>   Harvell said her team could not yet make specific forecasts on how
warming might alter ecosystems, but she said there was concern
because "diseases are capable of reshaping whole communities very
rapidly." She pointed to Caribbean corals, where many species that
existed for 4,000 years have been wiped out by disease in just 15
years.</TE>
<TE>   The changes have occurred during a century in which the planet's
temperature has risen by 1 degree Fahrenheit. Most scientists agree
that human-produced greenhouse gases have been the major factor and
predict the Earth will warm several more degrees by 2100.</TE>
<TE>   The new study does a good job of compiling temperature-related
changes in plant and animal diseases, and of not oversimplifying such
relationships, said Mark L. Wilson, an ecologist and epidemiologist
at the University of Michigan who has long been critical of previous
studies. Early work, he said, ignored factors such as evolution or
human intervention that could mitigate the effects of climate change.</TE>
<TE>   He lauded the authors for illuminating the complexity of the issue
by including examples of how warmer temperatures could decrease some
disease rates. "That's the kind of rigorous thinking I'd like to see
more of."</TE>
<TE>   The field has a long way to go, Wilson added, before it can
predict how climate change will play out. "The bottom line is, with
climate change things are very likely to change an awful lot, but in
what direction and at what rate?"</TE>
<TE>   Scientists still disagree about how much effect temperature change
has on the spread of human diseases.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the epidemiologists I deal with wouldn't rank climate
change as one of the major risks facing our populations, not because
we say it won't happen but because our priorities are elsewhere,"
said Simon Iain Hay, a zoologist at Oxford University who in February
published a study in Nature suggesting that increased malaria rates
in East African highlands were not due to rising temperatures.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Reiter, a dengue expert with the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention's Puerto Rico office, argues against the relative
importance of climate in human disease by pointing to periods in the
past when malaria and other tropical diseases pervaded cooler
regions. He argues that the spread of malaria is more closely linked
to deforestation, agricultural practices, human migration, poor
public health services, civil war, strife and natural disasters.</TE>
<TE>   "Claims that malaria resurgence is due to climate change ignore
these realities and disregard history," he wrote in an article about
malaria spreading through England during the Little Ice Age, which
began about 1450 and lasted for several hundred years.</TE>
<TE>   Other epidemiologists argue that humans may be able to counter new
temperature-sensitive plagues of disease with technology and better
public health services.</TE>
<TE>   A 1995 dengue pandemic that spread through Mexico, for example,
practically stopped at the Rio Grande. "You don't have such epidemics
[in the U.S.] today because you live in screened, air-conditioned
houses and have first-world health care," said Hay.</TE>
<TE>   Arguments that strong public health will shield us from emerging
plagues only frustrate Jonathan Patz and Paul Epstein, two physicians
who have spent more than a decade working on--and warning the world
about--what they see as a coming epidemic of climate-induced disease.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a truly disturbing panorama," said Epstein, of Harvard
Medical School's Center for Health and the Global Environment. "I'm
afraid we've underestimated the true costs of what climate change is
doing to our environment and our society."</TE>
<TE>   Patz, who directs the Program on Health Effects of Global
Environmental Change at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public
Health, agreed with those who said public health officials need to
address acute issues of poverty, sanitation and vaccination.</TE>
<TE>   But he said it would be dangerous to ignore climate-induced
problems that could wreak havoc.</TE>
<TE>   "That's like saying we'll only treat heart attacks and ignore
hypertension," he said. "This is not a black-and-white issue."</TE>

<HD>Mental Retardation: It's More Than Just IQ</HD>
<DH>Science: Experts use test scores as a rough benchmark, but
factors that measure a person's ability to live life also come into
play.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite decades of research, mental retardation remains an amorphous
concept defined not in black and white but in ever-changing shades of
gray.</LD>
<LD>   As recently as 40 years ago, the condition was defined primarily
by IQ scores, with a cutoff of about 85.</LD>
<LD>   But research and changing public perceptions have led to a more
complex definition that reflects not only a person's ability to
master tests of mental acuity but also the ability to master life
itself.</LD>
<TE>   Although an IQ of 70--100 is normal--is often considered a rough
standard of retardation, psychologists point to many people with such
low test scores who are able to live independently, hold down jobs,
marry and have families.</TE>
<TE>   "What we try to do is look at the entire picture and consider all
the mitigating variables" in deciding whether a person is mentally
retarded, said psychologist Jack Naglieri of George Mason University,
who said he has been involved in court cases involving convicts whose
mental status was questioned. "Sometimes it's not a simple thing to
determine."</TE>
<TE>   That difficulty casts what appears to be a straightforward
decision by the Supreme Court in a vastly muddier light. Experts
predict that the number of such cases will increase dramatically as
prisoners on death row try to stave off their fates.</TE>
<TE>   The measurement of intelligence has a long and convoluted history
that has been complicated by claims of racial bias in testing, the
use of such tests on people with poor English skills, and controversy
over the significance of test scores.</TE>
<TE>   Even aside from cultural issues, measuring IQ is an inexact
science. Results can be affected by a variety of factors, including
which test is used, when it is given and the subject's motivation.
Even if a good test is used and the subject cooperates, there is
still a significant chance that the actual IQ--as opposed to the
measured IQ--is 10 points higher or lower.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, psychologists find the process valuable.</TE>
<TE>   IQ, says psychologist Bruce Bracken of the College of William and
Mary, "is the best predictor of almost all life events: academic
success, military training, psychotherapy, midlife mortality,
criminality." People with high IQs receive the most education, get
the best jobs, make the most money and live the longest. Those with
the lowest IQs often get the short end of the stick.</TE>
<TE>   A low IQ doesn't mean that a person will necessarily become a
criminal, but it is a predisposing factor. Studies have shown that
the average IQ of prison inmates is about 92.</TE>
<TE>   But the effects of low IQ can be offset by perseverance,
dedication and other positive character traits.</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing that complexity, the American Assn. on Mental
Retardation defines the disorder as a significantly sub-average
intellectual functioning combined with impairments in the ability to
live and work independently. Furthermore, the condition must have
roots in childhood.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't become mentally retarded at age 45," said psychologist
Fred Biasini of the University of Alabama at Birmingham.</TE>
<TE>   According to various experts, from 2.3% to 2.5% of Americans have
IQs of 70 or below, but only about half of those are classified as
retarded because the rest are able to function adequately. Fewer than
0.25% have IQs below 50.</TE>
<TE>   IQ is largely a result of genetics. Some researchers say that
genes account for as much as 75% of an individual's IQ, although
others argue that the percentage is only about 55%.</TE>
<TE>   Very low IQ is often the result of nature's mistakes. From 20% to
30% of cases of severe mental retardation is caused by genetic
abnormalities such as the chromosome aberrations associated with Down
syndrome. Another 11% or so are caused by problems in childbirth such
as loss of an oxygen supply to the fetus. Brain trauma after birth
accounts for 3% to 12% of cases.</TE>
<TE>   The causes of the rest are generally unknown.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court's decision is likely to lead to large numbers of
death-row occupants trying to prove that they are retarded. It is, in
fact, quite easy to cheat on an IQ test--if you want to lower your
score. You just give wrong answers.</TE>
<TE>   "An astute psychologist will be sensitive to that," Bracken said.
But even if cheating is suspected, he added, the psychologist can't
arbitrarily raise the score. The tester will look at a variety of
other factors before making a final determination.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the keys is looking at a history of retardation," Biasini
said. "That should be easier to determine today. Many people with
retardation in their 30s and 40s have school-based histories of
special needs."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, the retarded now leave a long paper trail.</TE>

<HD>Percival, Angels Sweat for Win Over Cardinals</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Working in stifling heat, he gives up triple in
ninth before saving 3-2 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Troy Percival knows something about heat, so the Angel all-star
closer was determined to work quickly on a hot and sticky Thursday at
Busch Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Percival began his customary sprint from the bullpen when summoned
to preserve a one-run lead in the ninth inning after the Angels got
solid efforts from starter Scott Schoeneweis and three relievers, but
stopped after one stride with the temperature in the mid-90s and the
humidity stifling.</LD>
<LD>   The right-hander figured he should conserve his energy, and he
needed every bit of it to complete a 3-2 interleague victory against
the St. Louis Cardinals that ended the Angels' losing streak at four
games.</LD>
<TE>   Percival got Tino Martinez on an infield popup with the potential
tying run at third and go-ahead run at first, recording his 16th save
and believing he averted an ugly scene in the process.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, the first thing I thought was, 'It's miserably hot out
here," Percival said. "If I tied this game up, my players were going
to have a mutiny. It was to the point where I thought I'd be better
off giving up a two-run home run, 'cause otherwise my players won't
be able to play [today]."</TE>
<TE>   Schoeneweis (6-5) gave up six hits and one run in 5 2/3 innings,
rebounding from a horrible two-inning performance in his last start
against the Dodgers. The left-hander gave the rotation a needed boost
and helped the Angels salvage a victory in the three-game series
before 36,385.</TE>
<TE>   He threw 53 strikes in 81 pitches to cool off the hot Cardinals
(40-30), whose winning streak ended at five games, then watched as
Percival finished the job with his high-wire act in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Percival got himself into the jam, giving up a one-out triple to
Edgar Renteria and walking Jim Edmonds, his former Angel teammate, on
four pitches after striking out Eli Marrero. But Martinez popped out,
and the Angels (40-29) escaped with the victory despite squandering
several early opportunities to break the game open against Cardinal
left-hander Bud Smith (0-5).</TE>
<TE>   They took a 2-0 lead in the first on Tim Salmon's run-scoring
single and Scott Spiezio's sacrifice fly, but didn't make the most of
seven hits through the first three innings. Darin Erstad had one of
the club's few timely late-inning hits recently, singling to center
in the seventh to drive in leadoff batter David Eckstein and give the
Angels a 3-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein led the 11-hit attack, going three for four with two
doubles and two runs. The Angels could have done much more at the
plate, and the final inning was an adventure, but Manager Mike
Scioscia wasn't complaining after an upbeat moment in an otherwise
difficult stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "Perci, like most elite closers in this league, there's no sure
thing, from an offensive end," he said. "When you get a guy on third
with one out, you've still got to work for it.</TE>
<TE>   "You get the leadoff hitter on, it doesn't mean, all of a sudden,
you're going to rally. These guys that are in Perci's class, and he's
certainly one of the guys at the top of the list, these guys can shut
you down under an circumstance."</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman Adam Kennedy made a nifty play on pinch-hitter
Kerry Robinson's hard grounder for the first out in the ninth, then
Renteria tripled over the head of Angel left fielder Garret Anderson
and off the base of the wall. Percival went to work against Edmonds,
with whom he shares an agent, after Marrero couldn't catch up with
his 98-mph fastballs.</TE>
<TE>   Well, he sort of faced him, pitching around to put runners on the
corners.</TE>
<TE>   "You didn't think those were strikes? I had 'em just off,"
Percival joked. "I can't believe he took 'em. I think everybody in
the park knew what was going on right there. You cannot let a guy of
his caliber beat you in the ninth inning, and It's nothing against
the guy behind him.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not many people in the game that can play the game like
Jimmy Edmonds. When he turns it up a notch, and he wants to go out
there and get it done, there's nobody better. I'm not going to let
him win a ballgame right there. I've seen it too many times. I played
with the guy."</TE>

<HD>Buck Memorial Draws 15,000</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>A crowd estimated at 15,000 attended a memorial service at Busch
Stadium on Thursday for Jack Buck, the St. Louis Cardinals' Hall of
Fame broadcaster, before the Angels' 3-2 interleague victory.</LD>
<LD>   A closed casket was on the field during the hourlong ceremony
emceed by Buck's son, Joe, a broadcaster for Fox and the Cardinals.</LD>
<LD>   St. Louis Manager Tony La Russa and Cardinal Hall of Fame players
Stan Musial and Lou Brock were among many who participated in the
tribute to Buck, who died Tuesday at 77, sharing fond memories about
the man La Russa said "was the greatest Cardinal of all."</LD>
<TE>   Current Cardinal players watched from the dugout on a scorching
94-degree day, saying Buck also touched their lives and will be
missed.</TE>
<TE>   "From the moment you met him, you understood what kind of person
he was, just from his presence," said All-Star center fielder Jim
Edmonds, who quickly developed a strong relationship with Buck after
being traded from the Angels in March 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "His name and his face are everywhere around here, and he meant a
lot to the city and the baseball family. It was just a pleasure to be
a part of his life for the short time I had a chance to be."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The first-place Seattle Mariners withstood the Angels' post-April
push in the American League West, and now the resurgent Oakland
Athletics have rejoined the tight race.</TE>
<TE>   A's General Manager Billy Beane is known for making major trades
to bolster his club down the stretch run, and many believe the
Mariners still have not hit their stride. The Angel rotation is
experiencing a rough stretch and General Manager Bill Stoneman is
trying to acquire bullpen help, so things seemingly could be better.</TE>
<TE>   However, Manager Mike Scioscia said he's not worried.</TE>
<TE>   "We respect everyone in this division, but we also know how we're
capable of playing," he said. "We have the mental strength to be in
this for the long haul. There's no panic here."</TE>
<TE>   Struggling setup man Al Levine got the Angels out of a jam after
relieving starter Scott Schoeneweis with two on and two out in the
sixth, retiring Edgar Renteria on one pitch. But Levine gave up a
leadoff home run in the seventh to Eli Marrero in a shaky two-thirds
of an inning.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents are batting .357 against the right-hander this month, in
part explaining why Stoneman is interested in bolstering the bullpen
before the July 31 nonwaiver trading deadline.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>To Barrera, Mind Matters</HD>
<DH>Boxing: Onetime law student alternately ignores and
denigrates Morales.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>It seems almost everything written or said about Marco Antonio
Barrera refers to him as well-mannered and well-spoken, being from a
well-to-do middle-class family in Mexico City and, of course, being
well-educated because he spent time studying in law school.</LD>
<LD>   But with the mind games Barrera has been playing with Erik Morales
leading up to their featherweight fight Saturday night at the MGM
Grand Garden Arena, one has to wonder if Barrera took some psychology
classes along the way.</LD>
<LD>   After repeatedly stoking the fires of the regional
rivalry--Barrera being from the supposedly more cosmopolitan capital
city while Morales is from the reviled border town of
Tijuana--Barrera has backed off of late.</LD>
<TE>   Barrera is now paying back-handed compliments to the
darker-skinned Morales, claiming that both fighters are "puro
Mexicanos," pure Mexicans, after earlier saying that the only things
that come out of Tijuana are "Indios and burros," Indians and
donkeys.</TE>
<TE>   In one breath at the fight's final news conference Wednesday,
Barrera said he looked forward to the conclusion of the fight so that
the backbiting and bad-mouthing would cease along with the
country-polarizing rivalry.</TE>
<TE>   Yet 15 minutes later, with another reporter, Barrera was again
ripping into Morales, referring to the high-school dropout who was
born above a gym in Tijuana's red-light district as "ignorant."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps what caught the tone of Barrera's mind games best, though,
was what he didn't say after Morales embarked on a diatribe in
Spanish about how he was going to win the fight.</TE>
<TE>   As if he was suddenly above the fray, and perhaps to show that he
is indeed that well-rounded, Barrera addressed the gathering in
English and dismissed Morales' presence by not even mentioning his
name but rather congratulating the Mexican soccer team on its run in
the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Morales did a slow burn afterward, though Barrera insisted the
slight was not intended.</TE>
<TE>   "I was speaking English because I'm trying to learn a little,
that's all," Barrera said in Spanish. "It had nothing to do with him.
Our work, as Latino fighters, is to cross over to the side of the
United States. I need to be able to work on both sides."</TE>
<TE>   Barrera, it appears, also is schooled in the art of marketing. But
even while pleading ignorance, Barrera was sticking it to Morales.</TE>
<TE>   "It helps with my image because we are in different times now,"
Barrera said. "To be able to [thrive] we have to be able to go over
to the other side and not just stay [popular] in our home."</TE>
<TE>   Barrera has a point. He is already revered in his native land and,
in many corners of Mexico, is seen as the heir apparent to Mexican
legend Julio Cesar Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   But Barrera blushes when such comparisons are made and points to
the accomplishments of 108-pounder Ricardo Lopez (50-0-1, 37
knockouts), saying he is Mexico's best fighter.</TE>
<TE>   That Barrera is in position to receive and defer such praise
amuses and angers those in Morales' camp. After all, they say,
Morales is the World Boxing Council 126-pound champion and an
unbeaten fighter (41-0, 31 KOs) while the legend of Barrera (54-3, 39
KOs) has grown after each loss and with a dominating unanimous
decision over marketing-machine creation Prince Naseem Hamed on April
7, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   There was a time, however, when Barrera was contemplating
retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Having endured consecutive losses to Junior Jones--by
disqualification on Nov. 22, 1996, after his corner ran into the ring
when he was knocked down for a second time in the fifth round, and by
unanimous decision on April 18, 1997--Barrera fought only once in a
15-month stretch.</TE>
<TE>   After much soul-searching, Barrera returned to the ring and later
reclaimed his World Boxing Organization junior-featherweight title
with a third-round technical knockout of Richie Wenton on Oct. 31,
1998.</TE>
<TE>   While he sat out, Barrera was hounded by the Mexican press, which
wondered if he was thinking of returning to school to chase his
elusive law degree. The question arose again Wednesday and Barrera
seemed surprised.</TE>
<TE>   "That was all in the past," he said. "I don't even remember it or
the experience. I think I went four or five years. I don't know.
Ancient history." More mind games? Only Barrera knows for sure.</TE>

<HD>There's Something Germane to His Idea</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mal Florence</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post says he is caught up with
soccer fever: "We play 83-time winner Germany on Friday. Not to put
too fine a point on it, but many Germans rank soccer behind only
'full scale war' as the favorite sport of the country.</LD>
<LD>   "(Hey, how about France, huh? Talk about gagging on the fromage!
Three games, no goals. Au revoir, Pierre. Isn't it just like the
French to go out early and leave it up to us to beat the Germans?)"</LD>
<LD>   Trivia time: What do the following have in common? Tom Fears,
Manual Arts High; Don Clark, Washington High; Al Hoisch and Mike
Marienthal, L.A. High, and Bill Slayton, Garfield High.</LD>
<TE>   Our humble role: Bernie Lincicome in the Rocky Mountain News: "The
thing about soccer is, we don't actually have to win. We are so
insignificant that we only have to look like we might win. This is
ideal, wearing the same clothes as the groom but being an usher.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, when was the last time anybody got excited about being a
quarterfinalist? We are the Miss Congeniality of soccer. We hold the
coats of the real soccer nations."</TE>
<TE>   Minor interest: Shaun Powell in Newsday: "Within America, soccer
is the minority of the sports world, and regardless of the buzz from
our boys stationed in South Korea, that ain't going to change. Ever.</TE>
<TE>   "Five minutes after the U.S. men's team is eliminated, soccer goes
back to the kids and suburban moms."</TE>
<TE>   The stopper: Jack Buck, the raspy-voiced broadcaster who died
Tuesday at the age of 77, had a marvelous sense of humor. His former
CBS baseball partner, Tim McCarver, told the San Francisco Chronicle
they were on a cross-country flight in 1990 when McCarver was trapped
next to a man who talked incessantly.</TE>
<TE>   Buck later told him. "You know how to stop that? Just turn to the
guy and say, 'Have you been saved?' I'll guarantee he'll never say
another word to you."</TE>
<TE>   More Buck: He was broadcasting a game in the late 1970s when the
San Diego Padres had Butch Metzger, Dave Freisleben and Dave
Wehrmeister. His line: "They got their pitching staff when a U-Boat
surfaced off San Diego."</TE>
<TE>   FYI: Bloomberg News reports that Tiger Woods is 8-5 to complete
the first calendar-year sweep of golf's four majors.</TE>
<TE>   Stardust Race and Sports Book in Las Vegas lists Woods as the 1-2
favorite to win the British Open or PGA Championship this year. Odds
that he won't win either event are 4-1.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1970, Detroit's Cesar Gutierrez
performed a 20th-century first when he collected seven hits in a
12-inning, 9-8 victory over Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: All were first-team members of the 1940 Los Angeles
All-City football team. Slayton, the only one who didn't play college
football, became a trainer for heavyweight champions Ken Norton and
Michael Dokes.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Dustin Pillard has 50 tiny cows on his northern Iowa
farm, all about 3 feet tall. He's hoping they'll catch on as pets and
as rodeo novelty acts.</TE>
<TE>   The smallest fully grown animal is a 3-year-old bull that is 33
inches tall and weighs 320 pounds. The largest, a mature bull, is 35
inches tall and 400 pounds.</TE>

<DL>OMAHA</DL>
<LD>Jeff Ontiveros and Dustin Majewski homered for Texas, which clinched
a spot in the College World Series championship game by beating
Stanford, 6-5, on Thursday night.</LD>
<LD>   Jesen Merle (3-3) held Stanford to one hit in four innings of
relief and Huston Street picked up his third save of the series for
the Longhorns, who will play for the title on Saturday against the
winner of today's game between South Carolina and Clemson.</LD>
<LD>   Texas (56-15) advanced to the final game for the first time since
1989, when it lost to Wichita State. The Longhorns are in their 29th
CWS and have four national titles, the last in 1983.</LD>
<TE>   Stanford had a chance to tie it in the ninth when Sam Fuld led off
with a bunt single, but Street got Ryan Garko to fly out to center
and forced Jason Cooper to ground into a double play to end the game.
Street, a freshman, has 13 saves this season.</TE>
<TE>   Chris O'Riordan had two hits and drove in two runs and Chris
Carter hit a leadoff homer for Stanford (47-18), which lost in the
last two title games.</TE>
<TE>   The Longhorns beat the Cardinal, 8-7, on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Majewski's solo shot off Jeremy Guthrie (13-2) to right-center
field broke a 5-5 tie in the seventh and held up as the winning run.
It was Texas' 67th homer, tying the school record set in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford tied the score, 5-5, in the fifth on a hit batter, a
double by Cooper and O'Riordan's run-scoring single. O'Riordan and
Scott Dragicevich had RBI singles in the first.</TE>
<TE>   After falling behind, 3-0, in the first, Texas got two runs after
a two-out error in the second and took the lead with a three-run
fifth.</TE>

<HD>Perez Counts Blue Jays Out</HD>
<DH>Baseball: He doesn't let Green's mental error derail him as
Dodgers defeat Toronto, 2-1. Gagne gets 25th save.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dodger pitcher Odalis Perez was tossed out of the Toronto clubhouse
during a friendly visit Tuesday. He wouldn't have minded throwing it
back in the Blue Jays' faces by tossing a shutout Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Perez won the game, but he lost his shutout bid in the sixth
inning because of a mental gaffe by right fielder Shawn Green that
allowed the only Blue Jay run to score in a 2-1 Dodger victory in
front of 24,977 at Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   In what has become a Dodger routine, Eric Gagne pitched the ninth
for his major league-leading 25th save--although he did let the
potential tying run reach base when Carlos Delgado singled.</LD>
<TE>   Gagne ended the game by getting a strikeout and a double play, and
the Dodgers remained a game behind Arizona in the National League
West.</TE>
<TE>   What happened in the sixth inning was far from routine.</TE>
<TE>   With one out and runners on first and second, Green caught Tom
Wilson's fly ball, but kept jogging with his back to the field,
clearly thinking it was the third out.</TE>
<TE>   As astonished onlookers watched, the Blue Jays' Raul Mondesi
tagged up and scored all the way from second base on what officially
became a sacrifice fly for Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   "He came to me and told me, 'My bad, I thought there were three
outs,' " Perez said after Green's mistake. "I'll tell you the truth,
I felt bad because I wanted the shutout. We're human. We make
mistakes. Maybe that was one."</TE>
<TE>   Perez figures Blue Jay pitching coach Gil Patterson made one
Tuesday when Perez stopped by the visiting clubhouse hoping to see
Manager Carlos Tosca, his manager in the minors last year.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson, a bit old-school about clubhouse visits, told Perez to
leave, and the two had words.</TE>
<TE>   He could have said, "We have a rule.' There is a nice way," Perez
said. "He said, 'You've got to get out of here.'</TE>
<TE>   "I have nothing against Toronto, outside of their pitching coach.
He needs to be educated. That's no way to talk to a player."</TE>
<TE>   Patterson found he was at least a little out of step with some
modern players' habits.</TE>
<TE>   "In professional baseball, if you want to say hello, you don't do
it in the locker room. Say hello on the field, or go see friends at
lunch," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'No, no, no, Odalis, [when he came in.]"</TE>
<TE>   What Patterson didn't realize was that Mondesi, the former Dodger,
had visited the Dodger clubhouse too.</TE>
<TE>   He called him over to ask, and Mondesi more or less shrugged. He
had spent too much time with the Dodgers not to visit, and he even
hugged Tom Lasorda on the field before the game.</TE>
<TE>   Perez (8-3) downplayed the revenge factor a bit after his
five-hit, one-run outing over 7 1/3 innings. So did catcher Paul Lo
Duca.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if that had anything to do with it," Lo Duca said.
"He was nails out there. What can you say; he's been doing it all
year."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers took a 2-0 lead in the fourth after Green hit a
ground-rule double to left and Adrian Beltre drove him in with a
two-out single after Eric Karros grounded out and Brian Jordan was
intentionally walked.</TE>
<TE>   It was a nice breakthrough for Beltre, who had only two hits in
his previous 25 at-bats and was benched for a day Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy playing third base for us was like having a new player on
the field; that was my take on it," Manager Jim Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Cora, filling in at second because Mark Grudzielanek was
given a day off Thursday, dropped a run-scoring hit into shallow
center to drive in the second run.</TE>
<TE>   Green seemingly had a chance to redeem himself for the mental
error when he came up with none out in the eighth and Lo Duca on
first.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Jays lifted Esteban Loaiza (3-4) after a two-run, six-hit
performance over seven-plus innings to pit left-hander Scott Eyre
against the left-handed Green, who hit into a double play.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Karros grounded out to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   That left the game tight to the end, but maybe they owe Green one.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obvious Greenie forgot how many outs there were," Tracy
said. "He made a mental mistake, and I guarantee you no one's feeling
worse than he is."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Grudzielanek Gets a Day to Reflect</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The latest Dodger to be left off Jim Tracy's lineup card for a day
was second baseman Mark Grudzielanek, who is one for 18 on the
homestand.</LD>
<LD>   Third baseman Adrian Beltre--who didn't start Wednesday's
game--was back in the lineup Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe Tracy is thinking a day off can do for everyone what it did
for Shawn Green, who started his phenomenal hot streak after a
one-day benching in May.</LD>
<TE>   Tracy laughed, but called his strategy two-fold.</TE>
<TE>   "In a lot of cases, to me, there comes a point in time where just
a day off really benefits a guy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It also gives Tracy a chance to get players such as Dave Hansen or
Alex Cora in the lineup instead of only calling on them in crucial
pinch-hit situations.</TE>
<TE>   "In the [185] at-bats I got in the big leagues, I know what it's
like to hear your name called in the sixth or seventh," Tracy said.
"It feels a lot better if you've had the opportunity to see live
pitching instead of sitting for 10 or 12 days, then the bases are
loaded and they call your name and say, 'I need a sac-fly or a base
hit.' "</TE>
<TE>   Beltre returned to the lineup and committed his 12th error in the
third inning, but made up for it with a run-scoring single in the
fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Grudzielanek took his day off in stride.</TE>
<TE>   Though he has a condition on his right hand that requires him to
have fluid-filled bumps periodically drained, he focused more on
mental shortcomings.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not thinking about anything," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Actually, I'm thinking about a lot of things, but nothing about
my body."</TE>
<TE>   However, he added he will probably undergo a procedure on his hand
in the off-season to "take care of" the problem, probably related to
a minor tendon tear.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dodger coach Jack Clark, who once played for the Cardinals,
planned to take a red-eye flight to St. Louis after Thursday night's
game to attend the memorial service for broadcaster Jack Buck this
morning. He expects to return in time for tonight's game.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brett Quigley and Hidemichi Tanaka put up an impressive best-ball
number Thursday to top the crowded leaderboard in the Greater
Hartford Open at Cromwell, Conn.</LD>
<LD>   Quigley birdied four of the first six holes and Tanaka birdied
four of the last six for matching six-under 64s--and an eye-popping
13-under 57 best-ball total--in perfect conditions on the TPC at
River Highlands.</LD>
<LD>   "Today, I wasn't worried about the final score. I was just playing
and trying to have fun out there," Quigley said.</LD>
<TE>   Tanaka, a 10-time winner on the Japanese tour, made a 16-foot putt
on 16 and a 12-footer on 18 late in the afternoon session for his
best round on the PGA Tour.</TE>

<TE>   Karrie Webb, winless on the LPGA Tour this year, took advantage of
soft playing conditions and shot an eight-under-par 64 to take the
first-round lead at the Rochester International in Pittsford, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Webb, who won here three years ago, blistered the narrow Locust
Hill Country Club course with nine birdies in her lowest round in
nine tournaments this year and led Meg Mallon by three strokes.</TE>

<TE>   Bruce Fleisher knows he may have cancer. For now, his priority is
defending his U.S. Senior Open title.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Fleisher took a free tournament physical in
Nashville, and tests indicated that prostate cancer cells could be
present.</TE>
<TE>   Fleisher plans to play in the Greater Baltimore Classic this week
in Hunt Valley, Md., and in the U.S. Senior Open next week before
having further tests.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm fine," he said. "We found out that I may have a problem. I'm
going to address the problem after the Open."</TE>

<KH>BOYS' VOLLEYBALL PLAYER OF THE YEAR</KH>
<HD>Nihipali's Mustangs Were Able to Run Roughshod</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINA TELLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During fourth period each day at Manhattan Beach Mira Costa High, Pat
Nihipali was on-call for tech support.</LD>
<LD>   For the last three years, since he transferred from Anaheim
Esperanza High, Nihipali has been responsible for keeping the
school's computer network up and running.</LD>
<LD>   "They always managed to find me," he said. "I got pulled from
class a lot."</LD>
<TE>   The same skills the senior middle blocker used to troubleshoot
problems on a computer helped him on the volleyball court.</TE>
<TE>   "Most everything in volleyball is about watching what's going on
and reacting to it," Nihipali said. "In volleyball, you just watch
the setter's hands and you can tell where the ball is going to go.
It's the same with computers. They're set up to tell you a certain
code, so you know what's going on."</TE>
<TE>   Nihipali, The Times' boys' volleyball player of the year, averaged
19 kills and six blocks to help the Mustangs (28-1) win their second
consecutive Southern Section Division II championship. Mira Costa
defeated Bellflower St. John Bosco in the title match, 18-16, 15-6,
15-5, and Nihipali was selected the Division II player of the year
for a second consecutive season.</TE>
<TE>   The Mustangs were down, 13-7, in Game 1 of the final when Nihipali
provided a block that seemingly changed the momentum. They went on an
11-3 run and won, 18-16.</TE>
<TE>   "He was definitely a factor in their win," St. John Bosco Coach
Randy Totorp said. "He blocked some balls and emotionally got them
going [in the first game].</TE>
<TE>   "He proved to his team [the importance of not giving up] and
certainly played a big part in how they were able to pull it out."</TE>
<TE>   Momentum-shifting plays aren't all that Nihipali provides. His
positive energy rubs off on his teammates, who look to him for
encouragement.</TE>
<TE>   "He pushes everyone on the team to play better, even people on the
bench," said Tim Schneider, an opposite hitter. "They saw how good
Pat was and saw how much fun you could have playing volleyball. He
motivated a lot of people."</TE>
<TE>   Nihipali, 6 feet 8, will play next season for UCLA. His brother
Paul and sister Amy also played volleyball for the Bruins, but Pat
said that they didn't put any pressure on him.</TE>
<TE>   "They just told me, 'Go wherever you want' ... but they ruled out
Stanford or USC," Nihipali said with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   His departure creates a void at Mira Costa, on the volleyball
court and in class with technical support.</TE>

<KH>BOYS' GOLFER OF THE YEAR</KH>
<HD>Larsen Was No.1 on Best Team</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER YOON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About every gaudy score shot by the Santa Barbara San Marcos High
boys' golf team this season had two things in common.</LD>
<LD>   First, opposing coaches would shake their heads and declare the
Royals the best team ever to play high school golf. Second, junior
Kevin Larsen would lead the charge.</LD>
<LD>   Larsen had a team-best 66 the day San Marcos shot 19-under-par 341
to finish the Channel League finals. When San Marcos blistered the
Southern Section Central Coast Divisional tournament with a 354 for a
20-stroke victory, Larsen was medalist with a 67.</LD>
<TE>   Larsen's 72 on a tough day at La Purisima during the Southern
Section finals was one of only two scores of par or better and paved
the way for a San Marcos victory.</TE>
<TE>   He shot 69 when the Royals shot three under par as a team and
finished second to Palm Desert in the CIF-Southern California Golf
Assn. Championship.</TE>
<TE>   Larsen, the Channel League individual champion, had the best score
of any San Marcos player in every postseason tournament this season.
Simply put, he was the best player on one of the best teams ever,
earning him The Times' golfer of the year honor.</TE>
<TE>   "I dreamed of having a season like this," Larsen said. "But it was
pretty far out."</TE>
<TE>   Far under is more accurate.</TE>
<TE>   Larsen had a scoring average of 71.1 this season, shooting par or
better 17 times in 26 matches. He was under par 12 times, including
five rounds in the 60s, and twice shot 66. His highest round was a
78, but he shot 74 or higher only four times. He was 15 under par for
the season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's amazing how consistent he was," San Marcos Coach Aaron Solis
said. "He became really good at eliminating mistakes this year and
broke through big time."</TE>
<TE>   Eliminating double bogeys from his game was one of Larsen's goals
this year. He said he didn't achieve it, but his scores indicate
there weren't many.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a lot more mature on the course this year," Larsen said. "I
was thinking my way around a lot better."</TE>
<TE>   Larsen credits a strong support group that includes Solis, his
teammates, parents Keith and Trang, swing coach Don Parsons, and
sports psychologist Ben Heidger for his improvement.</TE>
<TE>   "Those people would do anything for me," Larsen said. "Golf is an
individual sport, but there are a lot of people who help you along
the way."</TE>
<TE>   Larsen said he would remember the high school season in a positive

<LD>There is no doubt who the sentimental favorite will be in the sixth
All-Star Jockey Championship tonight at Lone Star Park in Grand
Prairie, Texas.</LD>
<LD>   Chris McCarron, who announced his retirement a week ago and who
will ride for the final time Sunday at Hollywood Park, is among 12
jockeys who will compete in the four-race championship.</LD>
<LD>   The sixth-winningest rider in history with 7,137 victories,
McCarron could begin the competition with a victory. He will ride
Prized Amberpro, the likely favorite, in the fourth, a six-furlong
starter allowance for 4-year-olds and up. His other mounts are
longshot Clever Brick in the fifth, a 1 1/16-mile race on the turf
for $25,000 claimers; Flying Castelli in the seventh, a $37,000
allowance at one mile, and Yoto Speakes in the eighth, a $55,000
starter allowance at five furlongs on the turf.</LD>
<TE>   Besides McCarron, the other local jockeys riding tonight are
Laffit Pincay Jr., Victor Espinoza, Mike Smith, David Flores and Alex
Solis. The remaining jockeys are Robby Albarado, Russell Baze, Jorge
Chavez, Corey Lanerie, Edgar Prado and John Velasquez.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Valenzuela, Hollywood Park's leading jockey, will be a
busy man this evening. He is named on horses in seven of the eight
races at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Apprentice Kevin Krigger is scheduled to ride all eight races.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The best wagering race at Hollywood Park is the
seventh, a 6 1/2-furlong allowance for California-breds. The $48,000
contest for 3-year-olds and up attracted last-out winners Treasured
Note and Right Angle and eight others.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Paul Atkinson. The jockey has opened the Stockton meet
by winning with six of his first 21 mounts.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Howard Tesher. The trainer, based in New York, is two
for 51 in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Madeitothemoon and Black
Bart in the second, More Deelites and Emerald Monique in the third
and Giotto and Blue Warrior in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/113. Money: Previous day/meet

<HD>Maddux Injured, but Braves Rally</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Atlanta Braves felt a lot better about their chances when Adam
Bernero left the mound.</LD>
<LD>   Bernero pitched eight scoreless innings, but the Braves rallied
for three runs in the ninth to defeat the Detroit Tigers, 3-2,
Thursday night.</LD>
<LD>   Javy Lopez drove in the winning run with a two-out single against
Juan Acevedo, who couldn't preserve Detroit's second shutout against
the Braves in three games. "He was like [Greg] Maddux out there,"
Gary Sheffield said.</LD>
<TE>   "You think he's throwing you one straight. By the time you swing,
it's on your hands and breaks your bat."</TE>
<TE>   The real Maddux pitched five scoreless innings for Atlanta, but
had to leave the game after re-injuring a sore left calf muscle. He
wasn't sure if he would be able to make his next start.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 5, San Diego 0--Pedro Martinez struck out 11 and gave up
only two hits in eight innings as the Red Sox won at San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez (8-2), who struck out the first five batters he faced,
was coming off losses to Atlanta and Arizona, the first time he had
lost consecutive starts since September 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 7, Chicago Cubs 4--Former Cub Rafael Palmeiro hit a go-ahead
homer in the eighth inning, and one out later Kevin Mench had his
second of the game at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Playing at Wrigley Field for the first time since the Cubs traded
him away in 1988, Palmeiro homered in all three games of the series.
His decisive homer Thursday came off Juan Cruz (1-9).</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 5, Baltimore 1--Randy Johnson struck out 11 at Phoenix and
got an assist from the Diamondback offense just in time to record his
11th victory.</TE>
<TE>   The Diamondbacks sent nine men to the plate and scored five runs
in the seventh inning. Erubiel Durazo, who pinch-hit for Johnson,
drove in the go-ahead run with a bases-loaded walk off Willis
Roberts, who relieved Rodrigo Lopez (6-3).</TE>
<TE>   Chicago White Sox 6, Philadelphia 1--Mark Buehrle pitched shutout
ball into the ninth inning, and Paul Konerko made it easy by hitting
a three-run homer to lead the White Sox at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco 10, Tampa Bay 2--Marvin Benard had season-highs of
four hits and four runs, and Rich Aurilia had four RBIs for the
Giants at San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 5, Pittsburgh 3--Jermaine Dye drove in four runs with a
homer and a bases-loaded double to support Tim Hudson's effective
pitching, and the Athletics completed a three-game sweep at
Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   New York Mets 3, Minnesota 2--Steve Trachsel retired his first 19
batters and took a shutout into the ninth inning, and Mike Piazza and
Edgardo Alfonzo homered for the Mets at New York.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 3, Cincinnati 2--Ruben Sierra hit a two-run homer against
his former team, and James Baldwin pitched into the sixth inning to
earn the victory at Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 5, Kansas City 4--Vladimir Guerrero scored on a throwing
error by pitcher Scott Mullen in the 11th inning at Montreal, and the
Expos extended their winning streak to a season-high seven games.</TE>

<DH>Horse racing: McCarron's retirement should open
opportunities for talented group of young jockeys.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like many jockeys at Hollywood Park, newcomer Jason Lumpkins sees the
imminent retirement of Chris McCarron through different prisms.</LD>
<LD>   "I was saddened," Lumpkins said, "because Chris is a great jockey,
a nice guy and someone who's made a lot of contributions to the
sport. When I was younger, I would watch Chris ride in all those
Kentucky Derbys and say to myself that I would like to be in his
shoes some day. I wish Chris and his family nothing but the best.</LD>
<LD>   "But also, Chris' leaving might open some doors for the rest of
us. Maybe I can get my foot in one of those doors, and kick some of
the marbles around."</LD>
<TE>   Lumpkins, that rare Northern California jockey who threatened the
long-running dominance of Russell Baze the last two years, had
already made the decision to compete in the Southland before McCarron
said last Saturday that this Sunday would be his career finale.
Likewise, Kevin Krigger, an 18-year-old apprentice, had arrived
locally weeks ago, well before McCarron's stunning announcement. But
now these two riders--Lumpkins, the well-traveled 32-year-old
journeyman, and Krigger, the teenager from the Virgin Islands--find
themselves on the fringe of a talent pool that will have one fewer
Hall of Fame jockey to contend with.</TE>
<TE>   "Even without Chris," Tony Matos said, "this is still the toughest
jockey colony in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Matos, who has been booking mounts for the country's top jockeys
for more than 30 years, represents Krigger and Victor Espinoza, who
is on the cusp of a career breakout after winning this year's
Kentucky Derby and Preakness aboard War Emblem.</TE>
<TE>   Of the three remaining Hall of Fame riders, Laffit Pincay is 55,
Eddie Delahoussaye is 50 and Gary Stevens is a 39-year-old with
60-year-old knees, but it would be a fallacy to suggest that what
McCarron is leaving behind is a collection of superannuated
graybeards. In truth, the Southern California riding colony is rife
with a skilled group of jockeys still in their 30s. They are either
riding at the peak of their powers, or fast approaching the day when
they might take their game to the next level.</TE>
<TE>   Merely because of mathematics, McCarron's departure figures to
hasten that process. "No question," said jockey agent Tom Knust,
"that trainers are going to have more choices."</TE>
<TE>   Knust books mounts for Kent Desormeaux, who at 32 was on the Hall
of Fame ballot for the first time this year. Besides Stevens,
Desormeaux and Espinoza, other heavy hitters in their 30s include Pat
Valenzuela, Alex Solis, Mike Smith, Corey Nakatani, David Flores and
Garrett Gomez. The list is so deep that riders such as Martin Pedroza
and Jose Valdivia Jr.--who's only 27--must work overtime to keep
their identities. And the competition is so keen that all it takes is
one slump--see Tyler Baze, the Eclipse Award-winning apprentice for
2000--to fall from consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   Valenzuela, 39, has been in trouble with California racing
authorities because of drug problems, but he has reinvigorated
himself once more and is currently atop the leaderboard at the
Hollywood Park meet with almost 50 wins. Since 1992, Solis, 38, has
won 15 riding titles at Santa Anita, Hollywood Park and Del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, 36, won Eclipse Awards in 1993-94, and was the regular
rider for horse-of-the-year champions Holy Bull and Skip Away, but
his career dead-ended after a 1998 spill at Saratoga, where he broke
two vertebrae. Smith, who had been based in New York, began riding at
Hollywood Park in May of last year. This year, his mounts, who have
included Proud Citizen, Azeri and the now-retired Snow Ridge, have
earned $3.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike did the right thing," Knust said. "He saw that the guys at
the top out here--Laffit, Delahoussaye and Chris--had some age on
them and decided to take a shot."</TE>
<TE>   For Southern California jockeys, there's a high pitch to every
race, even when a $21,000 five-furlong sprint for maiden 2-year-old
fillies is run before what looks like an exclusive crowd on a midweek
afternoon at Hollywood Park. At the 16th pole in what became a
two-horse race, it appeared that after the veteran Gomez and his
mount, Shesafortunatecat, ranged up on the outside flank of the
youngster Krigger and his horse, Humorous Lady, they would sail on by
and win easily. Gomez had even opted for Shesafortunatecat, the 7-10
favorite, after having ridden Humorous Lady to a third-place finish
in her career debut two weeks before.</TE>
<TE>   But Krigger found another gear for Humorous Lady, and they hung on
tenaciously for a narrow win. It didn't hurt that Humorous Lady,
because of Krigger's apprentice standing, was carrying 114 pounds,
five fewer than Shesafortunatecat.</TE>
<TE>   Krigger, who is a string bean 5-foot-4 at 106 pounds, will lose
his apprentice weight allowance in November and cross that scale when
he comes to it. Meantime, he is rolling up wins in impressive
quantities at Hollywood Park. Last week, he had a three-win day
there, and Humorous Lady gave him his 16th victory of the meet, good
for ninth place in the standings.</TE>
<TE>   "I like competition," Krigger said, "and one of the reasons I left
Thistledown [in Cleveland] was to become a better rider. The better
the competition, the more it tests your ability, and I like that."</TE>
<TE>   His trip from Ohio to Santa Anita and Hollywood Park was not
nonstop. Early this year, Krigger dropped in on the meet at Golden
Gate Fields, where he registered 54 wins--competing against Russell
Baze and Lumpkins--before a chipped elbow, suffered in a spill, sent
him home to Saint Croix. While recuperating, Krigger was told by Paul
Nicolo, the clerk of scales at Golden Gate, that Matos might be
interested in taking over his book in Southern California. Matos had
already watched the kid ride on tape, and after one phone
conversation they hooked up.</TE>
<TE>   "Kevin has natural talent," said Julio Felix, another Thistledown
jockey. "He just needs a little guidance. He remembers what you teach
him."</TE>
<TE>   Matos figures there's no better place to learn than in the local
maelstrom.</TE>
<TE>   "The better the circuit, the more a young rider can learn the
techniques," Matos said. "I hope Pincay and Delahoussaye never
retire, because riding alongside them can only make Kevin and Victor
better riders. The other Lakers are better because they play
alongside [Shaquille O'Neal] and Kobe [Bryant], and it's the same way
at the track. Laffit and Eddie might be trying to beat Kevin every
race they ride against him, but they can become his assets too."</TE>
<TE>   Like Krigger, Lumpkins came to California from Thistledown, where
he had racked up 14 riding titles. Trainer Wayne McDonnell, once the
agent for the late Ron Hansen, told Lumpkins that he was good enough
to make the move from Ohio to Bay Meadows and Golden Gate. During
almost two years at the Bay Area tracks, Lumpkins hung up enough wins
to threaten the stranglehold that Russell Baze has had on that
circuit for about 20 years. In April, Lumpkins had a six-win day at
Bay Meadows for the second time, and finished the meet last Sunday
with 73 wins, 26 fewer than Baze. Lumpkins won 264 races last year,
finishing 16th nationally, and with 141 wins he ranks eighth in the
country this year.</TE>
<TE>   Working with Northern California agent Dennis Patterson, Lumpkins
rode four races at Hollywood Park on Wednesday, but he will return to
the Inglewood track only sparingly the rest of the meet, before
tackling the Del Mar season full-time starting July 24. Lumpkins will
be testing a circuit that wasn't particularly kind to Russell Baze
for three years in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it's going to be super-tough," Lumpkins said, "but already
I'm tired of chasing Baze where I am, so it's worth a try. I'm going
to work hard and see what happens. It's very important that I get off
to a good start at Del Mar. If that happens, maybe some of the
business will shift my way."</TE>

<HD>Spain Remembers the Pain</HD>
<DH>Soccer: In 1994 World Cup, the Spaniards lost a 2-0 lead in
the last five minutes and were tied by the South Koreans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ULSAN, South Korea</DL>
<LD>When Spain plays South Korea in the quarterfinals Saturday in
Gwangju, South Korea, at least three Spanish players will recall the
last time the teams met in the World Cup.</LD>
<LD>   That was at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas during the USA '94
tournament, when Luis Enrique, Miguel Angel Nadal, Fernando Hierro
and the rest of the Spanish team were caught by surprise as the
Koreans came from two goals down to tie the score, 2-2, in the final
five minutes.</LD>
<LD>   "It was incredibly hot that day in Dallas," Luis Enrique said.
"I've never played in conditions like that. I don't know what sort of
physical preparation South Korea had, but they were flying."</LD>
<TE>   That remark, entirely innocent in intent, took on new meaning
Thursday when reporters began seeking the reasons behind South
Korea's remarkable fitness and stamina. The notion inevitably
surfaced that drugs might be involved.</TE>
<TE>   "We work very hard," Coach Guus Hiddink responded. "You can't
improve players' speed with medication."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it can be done by more unconventional means, however.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea team doctor Kim Hyon-Chul told the Dong-A-Ilbo
newspaper that the players have been taking pills made from carp and
mullet, as well as medicinal herbs and steamed ginseng, three times a
day since March to increase their stamina.</TE>
<TE>   Luis Enrique is concerned not only by the Koreans' physical
condition, however, but their other qualities.</TE>
<TE>   "Their strong running is the most obvious thing," he said, "but
technically they are at a very high level as well. With a European
coach, they have improved in tactical terms, and physically they look
to be in the same shape as eight years ago."</TE>
<TE>   The Spanish camp is troubled by the idea that its top striker,
Raul, might not be available for the game because of a groin strain
suffered in the game against Ireland. The injury has prevented him
from training this week</TE>
<TE>   "Raul is important for us when he plays but isn't when he
doesn't," Spain Coach Jose Antonio Camacho said in an unusual turn of
phrase.</TE>
<TE>   Much will depend on how Spain responds to South Korea's all-out,
never-give-up style of play.</TE>
<TE>   Hiddink, who has injury worries of his own, said that approach is
unlikely to change with a berth in the semifinals at stake.</TE>
<TE>   "I want them to take the initiative," he said of his players, "and
then we'll see at the end. So far, it has brought us good results."</TE>
<TE>   Like teammate Luis Enrique, Spanish midfielder Gaizka Mendieta
enters the match with a wary attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the names and the record books, then we are
favorites," he said. "But there are always surprises at a World Cup."</TE>

<TE>*--*
Tonight, 11:30 PDT, at Gwangju, South Korea
TV: ESPN2, Ch. 34. Delayed: Ch. 46, noon; ESPN2, 6:30 p.m
How they got here: South Korea won Group D, then defeated Italy, 2-1,
in overtime in the second round; Spain won Group B, then tied
Ireland, 1-1, in the second round but advanced on penalty kicks, 3-2
South Korea update: Coach Guus Hiddink knows the Spanish players
well, having been coach of Real Madrid. But he is more concerned
about his players recovering from Tuesday's overtime victory.
Defender Kim Tae-Young broke his nose in that game, midfielder Kim
Nam-Il twisted an ankle and midfielder Park Ji-Sung injured a
hamstring. "Those are important players, so we have some setbacks,"
Hiddink said. "The situation is not so good."
Spain update: Coach Jose Antonio Camacho believes it is vital for his
team to control the pace of the game or the Koreans might run away
with it. "They're very intense, fast, and what we can't do is be
infected by that," he said. "We have to play our game, keep
possession and not lose the ball too much, otherwise physically they
overwhelm you." Striker Raul might sit out the game because of a
groin strain. Camacho dismissed the home crowd as a factor. "We will
play here with all the circumstances against us," he said, "but we
have the players to deal with that."
Outlook: It could come down to the availability of Raul. "If he says
he is 100% and the doctor says he is 100%, he will play," Camacho
said. "If not, he won't." Spain should win by a goal</TE>

<LD>If Running Bac runs tonight as she did May 24, the field in the
$15,000 Deelish Handicap is chasing second money.</LD>
<LD>   A 4-year-old mare bred in Utah, Running Bac won the Blushing By
Handicap by 1 3/4 lengths in her first start of the year. It was her
seventh win in 13 lifetime starts and she should be hard to handle
from the rail again this evening.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Francisco Diaz and trained by Juan Aleman, the daughter
of Splash Bac will be ridden by Ramon Sanchez in the 350-yard
Deelish, named in honor of the champion aged mare of 2000.</LD>
<TE>   The only other participant in the field of six fresh off a victory
is Charmed Mongoose Bug.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the lineup are Imjumpn, a winner of four of 12 for
co-owner and trainer Blane Schvaneveldt; Naughty Corona; WCR Rubys
Diamond, who has been idle since last Oct. 20, and Lone Star Park
shipper Stylish Sign.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Brisco Lamb. 2. Jake Blues. 3. Justa Dance. 4.
Lovely Gay Shook. 5. Murr Key Blurr. 6. Ole's Shadow. 7. Priscillas
New Doc. 8. Heza Class Man. 9. Running Bac. 10. First A Princess.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Priscillas New Doc, Ribalta, Beauty Goes First and JD
Pesky in the seventh, Heza Class Man and Little Like Magic in the
eighth, single Running Bac in the ninth and use Lender, Farahon,
Swift Intruder and First A Princess in the 10th.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Neva Paranoide drops in class in the sixth as
he makes his first start in nearly 13 months for trainer Juan
Cervantes. Swift Intruder could improve second time out for trainer
Connie Hall as he adds Lasix in the 10th.</TE>

<HD>Castillo Swinging in the Rain</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Shortened game doesn't stop hit streak, which
reaches 34 in Marlins' 3-0 victory over Indians.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Rain limited Luis Castillo to three at-bats, which was two more than
he needed.</LD>
<LD>   Castillo slashed a single in the first inning Thursday night and
extended his hitting streak to 34 games, breaking Rogers Hornsby's
record for a second baseman and tying Dom DiMaggio and three other
players.</LD>
<LD>   "That's what I want to do in my first at-bat, so I can feel
loose," Castillo said.</LD>
<TE>   He scored the first run to help the Florida Marlins defeat
Cleveland, 3-0, in a game called in bottom of the sixth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo, who finished one for three, slapped a 2-2 pitch from
Ryan Drese to left field--the 12th time he has had a hit in the first
inning during the streak.</TE>
<TE>   The start of the game was delayed 17 minutes by rain. There was
another delay of one hour 42 minutes before the game was called at
11:02 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "If Luis didn't get a hit in the first inning, I guarantee we'd be
here until 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning so he could get a hit,"
Marlin third base coach Ozzie Guillen said.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo, a Dominican, matched Benito Santiago's record for the
longest hitting streak by a player born outside the United States and
surpassed Hornsby's 33-game streak in 1922.</TE>
<TE>   Four other players had one-season streaks of 34 games--DiMaggio
(1949), Santiago (1987), George McQuinn (1934) and George Sisler
(1925). Only 10 players have had a longer streak, including two since
1950--Pete Rose (44) in 1978 and Paul Molitor (39) in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   "When I'm finished, I'll feel good for what I did," Castillo said.</TE>
<TE>   The switch-hitting leadoff man said he might bat right-handed
today when he faces knuckleballs from Detroit right-hander Steve
Sparks.</TE>
<TE>   Announced attendance was 8,045, and there were perhaps 5,000 fans
actually on hand, some wearing rain slickers. Many gave Castillo a
standing ovation when he drove a single past third baseman Travis
Fryman.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd included Castillo's 9-year-old nephew, Carlos. Castillo
brought the youngster, a Little League second baseman, to his first
Marlins' game.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'You want to see me play? You can see me today,' "
Castillo said.</TE>
<TE>   While the stands were mostly empty, there was at least one sign of
the buzz building around the streak: The Marlins arranged a postgame
news conference for Castillo for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day I have a little more pressure," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Florida completed a three-game sweep of the Indians in the first
meeting between the teams since the 1997 World Series, which the
Marlins also won.</TE>
<TE>   A.J. Burnett (8-5) gave up two hits in six innings, extending his
shutout streak to 18 consecutive innings. He improved to 6-0 in
interleague play with a 2.73 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   Marlins starters have given up only one run in the last 38
innings.</TE>
<TE>   Florida's Mike Lowell hit his 10th home run, and Preston Wilson
scored from second base on a sacrifice bunt.</TE>
<TE>   Drese (7-5), hit twice by batted balls, gave up seven hits and
three runs in five innings. He struck out eight.</TE>
<TE>   The Indians stopped Joe DiMaggio's record 56-game hitting streak
in 1941, but in three games they couldn't stop Castillo. He's hitting
.400 during the streak and .338 this season.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Riverside International Raceway, closed for more than a decade, will
be remembered this weekend when the Southern California Historic
Sports Car Festival is held on California Speedway's road course in
Fontana--22 miles from what is now the Moreno Valley Mall.</LD>
<LD>   Parnelli Jones will be grand marshal of the event, and while his
name perhaps is not as synonymous with Riverside as Dan Gurney, the
1963 Indianapolis 500 winner left his mark on the track in numerous
ways.</LD>
<LD>   In 1958, when Jones was still better known as a jalopy jockey at
Ascot Park, he was the only driver to compete in three 500-mile
races--one each for sprint cars, midgets and stock cars--over
Memorial Day weekend.</LD>
<TE>   "I got the pole and finished third in my midget, dropped out of
the sprint car race and had the stock car race won before the engine
blew in my Ford," Jones, 68, recalled during a nostalgic luncheon
Wednesday at the Mission Inn, headquarters for many of Riverside's
races.</TE>
<TE>   The stock car race, won by Eddie Gray in six hours and 17 minutes,
was the first NASCAR race held on Riverside's road course.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd driven at Willow Springs before, so I'd been on a road
course, but those were the first times I'd tried 500 miles--three
days in a row," Jones said. "Vel [Miletich] had given me a Ford for
the stocker and I was so far ahead with 100 miles to go it was
ridiculous, but then the engine let go."</TE>
<TE>   Although Riverside's first race weekend was Sept. 21-22, 1957, it
was a Cal Club event, so the tripleheader was the track's first major
event.</TE>
<TE>   Jones later won a NASCAR 500-miler in 1967, breaking Gurney's
remarkable string of four wins.</TE>
<TE>   "I was driving for Bill Stroppe and Cale Yarborough was driving
for the Wood Brothers. When Cale crashed in practice, he destroyed
his car so I got the Wood Brothers to crew for my car. I think I
lapped everybody twice. The Wood Brothers really made a difference."</TE>
<TE>   All five of Gurney's wins were with the Wood Brothers. The 1967
race was the only time they weren't with Gurney.</TE>
<TE>   Although Jones is best known for his Indy 500 win, he never drove
in an Indy car race at Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time Indy cars raced there was 1967 and I had quit
racing open-cockpit cars after I won at Indy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jones' most memorable Riverside victory came in the 1970 Mission
Bell 200, a Trans Am race, when he came back to win after his Mustang
was knocked off the track by a lapped driver.</TE>
<TE>   "I took a really hard lick on the right side of the car when I got
hit coming through Turn 9. I decided not to go in the pits even
though the car was vibrating like crazy. I guess I was back as far as
ninth. The car was so out of balance that when I went through the
esses, I've seen pictures where the right-side wheels weren't even on
the track. I kept them on the dirt most of the way. I never thought
I'd finish but I finally caught [George] Follmer and won the race. It
was one of the most exciting races I can remember."</TE>
<TE>   In the tire war days, Jones drove a Goodyear-sponsored Cooper Ford
owned by Carroll Shelby--using Firestone tires--to win a Times Grand
Prix for Sports Cars in 1964, beating Roger Penske and Jimmy Clark.
Jones was a Firestone team driver.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the final races at the track, in 1987, he won a
three-hour Firestone Firehawk event.</TE>
<TE>   "I get a sorrowful feeling every time I go past Riverside," Jones
said. "If you'd ever been there, you couldn't help but miss the
place."</TE>
<TE>   Ed Swart, a longtime vintage racer from Rolling Hills, formed
Historic Sports Car Racing West in 1999 and his group, with
assistance from Racer magazine, will present a weekend of racing in
memory of Riverside. Practice and qualifying today will be followed
by qualifying races Saturday and 30-minute races for 14 classes on

<TE>   While most Winston Cup drivers complain that 38 races a year are
too much, there are others who want more. With NASCAR visiting Sears
Point Raceway in Sonoma this week, several drivers are planning extra
duty.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Stewart, last year's Sears Point winner and runner-up in
Winston Cup standings, will drive a Beast sprint car at Altamont
Raceway Park in a U.S. Auto Club Western regional race Saturday
night.</TE>
<TE>   Robby Gordon, Kevin Harvick and Jeff Green will compete Saturday
afternoon in the Featherlite Southwest series 200 on Sears Point's
10-turn, two-mile road course. Gordon was second to Stewart in last
year's Winston Cup race on the same track.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to run that race to have a good time, but we also
want to win," said Harvick, last year's NASCAR rookie of the year.
"Plus the extra time on the road course is going to help us for the
Winston Cup race the next day."</TE>
<TE>   Harvick, a Bakersfield native, won a Winston West race there
during his 1998 championship season.</TE>
<TE>   Where's Jeremy?</TE>
<TE>   Editors of Racer X magazine revealed their choice of the 25 best
American motocross riders in their July issue. The first two are
Ricky Carmichael and Bob "Hurricane" Hannah, both solid choices, but
what about Jeremy McGrath? Broc Glover is No. 3, followed by longtime
rivals Ricky Johnson and Jeff Ward. Then come Mark Barnett, Jeff
Emig, Jeff Stanton and Brad Lackey.</TE>
<TE>   Still no McGrath. He finally makes it at No. 22, back of Mike
Kiedrowski, Doug Henry, David Bailey, Kent Howerton, Tony DiStefano,
Mike LaRocco, Marty Smith, Steve Lamson, Danny LaPorte, Jim Weinert,
Gary Jones and Ron Lechien.</TE>
<TE>   It's a shocker, McGrath at No. 22, but the catch is that Racer X
was considering outdoor motocross only, thus eliminating McGrath's
remarkable supercross record. Outdoors, he won only one 250cc
national championship.</TE>
<TE>   Sprint Cars</TE>
<TE>   After 14 races, things are finally back to normal in the Sprint
Car Racing Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Griffin, the Gas Man from Silver City, N.M., gained the
No. 1 spot in SCRA standings after a victory at Santa Maria Speedway
last week. It was the first win of 2002 for Griffin, a three-time
champion, and it gave him a six-point lead over Steve Ostling,
followed closely by Tony Jones and defending champion Cory Kruseman.</TE>
<TE>   The SCRA will return to its home track, Perris Auto Speedway, on
Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   Irwindale Returns</TE>
<TE>   After a week off while changes were made in Irwindale Speedway's
outer wall, racing returns to the half-mile paved oval Saturday night
with main events for NASCAR Weekly Racing Series late models, super
stocks, legends cars and American race trucks.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the track was closed last Saturday night, more than
500 people showed up, apparently unaware that the program had been
canceled.</TE>
<TE>   Last Laps</TE>
<TE>   Bill Betteridge, midget car racing's first superstar, heads a list
of four inductees into the National Midget Hall of Fame. Betteridge
began racing in 1933 and won the National Midget Assn. championship
in 1934 and 1936 before losing his life in 1937 at Atlantic Speedway
in Cudahy. Other inductees include drivers Tom Bigelow and Billy
Wood, both from Wisconsin, and journalist/TV commentator Chris
Economaki.</TE>
<TE>   Nissan North America Inc. announced that it will no longer provide
Infiniti engines for the Indy Racing League after the 2002 season.
Instead, it will concentrate on the new Infiniti Pro Series, an IRL
developing program that will begin July 7 at Kansas Speedway. With
Infiniti out, the IRL will have engines built by Chevrolet, Honda and
Toyota.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Hunsaker of Chino Hills and Phil Goodwine of Mira Loma will
be favorites when USAC holds a Ford Focus midget race Saturday night
at San Bernardino's Orange Show Speedway. ... Frank Mendoza will be
defending champion when M.K. Smith holds his annual Chino Challenge
Demolition Derby at the Chino Fairgrounds on Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   Passings</TE>
<TE>   Ed Ingalls, one of motor racing's most renowned photographers and
artists, died last Sunday of a stroke. He was 77. Services are 11
a.m. Saturday at the Church of Santa Maria in Orinda, Calif.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The NHL is taking over operation of the financially troubled Buffalo
Sabres.</LD>
<LD>   Commissioner Gary Bettman said Thursday that owner John Rigas had
agreed to the move. Although Rigas technically remains the Sabres'
owner, the move helps clear the way for the potential sale of the
franchise.</LD>
<LD>   Buffalo businessman Mark Hamister is trying to form a group of
investors to purchase the Sabres.</LD>
<TE>   Bettman said the NHL will not pick up any of the team's debts,
which amount to $157 million owed to Adelphia Communications.</TE>

<TE>   Jose Theodore of the Montreal Canadiens was honored as the NHL's
most valuable player and top goaltender during the league's awards
presentation.</TE>
<TE>   Theodore won the Hart Trophy as MVP and the Vezina Trophy as best
goalie. He's the first goaltender to be named as the league's top
player since Buffalo's Dominik Hasek in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit's Nicklas Lidstrom repeated as the league's top defenseman
and Atlanta's Dany Heatley was the top rookie.</TE>

<HD>NHL Orders Arenas to Hang Safety Netting Behind Goals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>NHL arenas will have a different look next season as part of the
league's response to safety concerns for fans.</LD>
<LD>   Netting will be hung behind the goals following the death in March
of a 13-year-old girl who was struck in the head by a puck.</LD>
<LD>   At its meeting Thursday, the NHL's Board of Governors ordered
installation of the nets as well as standardizing the height of the
glass around the rink to a minimum of five feet.</LD>
<TE>   The decision follows the death of Brittanie Cecil, who was hit by
a deflected slap shot March 16 at a Columbus Blue Jacket game.</TE>
<TE>   She died two days later after an injury to an artery in her neck
caused internal bleeding, the first documented death of a fan from
being struck by a puck at an NHL game.</TE>
<TE>   Although a league report found its arenas to be safe, Commissioner
Gary Bettman said, "We're doing it because we think it's the right
thing to do after what has happened."</TE>
<TE>   The netting will hang from the ceiling, and rest on top of the
glass.</TE>
<TE>   It will be hung across the end zones, stretching from the corners
of the rink.</TE>
<TE>   Bettman said such measures would have prevented the puck that
struck Cecil from entering the stands.</TE>

<HD>No Lack of Motivation to Run With a Fast Crowd</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the Athens Summer Games two years away and the next world
championships a year off, U.S. track and field athletes are finding
other motivation this summer.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the year to make money," sprinter Tim Montgomery said.
"That's the only way I can put it. You go out and just run and take
the experience from this year to the Olympics."</LD>
<LD>   He'd like to gain experience at beating Maurice Greene this
weekend in Palo Alto, at the U.S. Outdoor Championships. Montgomery
and Shawn Crawford, also entered in the 100, have run the 100 meters
this season in 9.94 seconds, the world's fastest time. Greene, the
world record holder, made his season debut with a clocking of 9.97
seconds June 10 in Athens.</LD>
<TE>   "We're going to have one of the greatest 100s ever in the U.S.,"
Montgomery said. "You're going to have six guys in the lineup under
10 seconds."</TE>
<TE>   The other sub-10 second sprinters in the field are J.J. Johnson
(9.95), Coby Miller (9.98) and Brian Lewis (9.99)</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery believes his rivalry with Greene is good for the sport.
"I think it's very important," he said. "It's like wrestling. They
take certain athletes and make them into stars. In track and field,
you've got to make yourself a star."</TE>
<TE>   Greene, who beat Montgomery in the 100 at last year's world meet,
expects the 100 to be the showcase event. "We're going to give the
people here in the United States something to see," said Greene, who
has agreed to participate in USA Track and Field's Golden Spike Tour
through 2004. "They will get a fantastic show."</TE>
<TE>   That won't be the only event worth watching as athletes vie for
$451,500 in prize money and berths on the U.S. team in September's
World Cup meet in Madrid, Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Marion Jones, seeking her fourth 100 title, ran a world-leading
10.90 seconds at the Prefontaine Classic last month. Angela Williams
of USC, the first collegian to win four NCAA 100-meter titles, was
third in the 100 last season.</TE>
<TE>   The men's long jump also could be noteworthy. Defending U.S.
champion Savante Stringfellow has the two longest jumps of the season
(27 feet 4 inches and 27-10 1/4) and Miguel Pate has the
third-longest, 27-2. Pate won the U.S. indoor title with a jump of
28-2 1/4, the longest since Carl Lewis set the world indoor record of
28-10 1/4 in 1984. Dwight Phillips, third at last year's U.S. outdoor
meet, is another top contender.</TE>
<TE>   Splish Splash</TE>
<TE>   Ratko Rudic, coach of the U.S. men's water polo team, sees one key
factor separating U.S. players from their more successful European
rivals.</TE>
<TE>   "Physically, U.S. players, especially in the beginning, have the
same or better quality as Europeans," he said. "The problem is they
don't have adequate competition. European players play so many
important games.</TE>
<TE>   "Technique and behavior are so important in these kinds of games.
We have to build this and create this. We are now in the beginning."</TE>
<TE>   The first big step for the U.S. team will come when it faces
Croatia in the opener of the new FINA World League, next Friday at
Los Alamitos. Eight national teams will participate in the inaugural
season, with the finals to be held Aug. 1-4 in Athens. The U.S. has
been grouped with Croatia, Hungary and Russia.</TE>
<TE>   The league represents a significant part of Rudic's plan to
transform the U.S. into an Olympic and world power. He has seen some
progress in slightly more than a year on the job, but the extent will
be apparent during World League play and at the World Cup, which will
take place in Belgrade in August.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Azevedo of Long Beach and Stanford, one of three Sydney
Olympians on the U.S. team, believes the World League will help U.S.
players catch up internationally.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been so behind for so long," he said. "Europeans start
playing when they're 8 years old and scrimmage and play games all the
time. They play 100 games a year. Here, we swim and lift and play 25
games a year....</TE>
<TE>   "The problem we have is in the fourth quarter, and that's purely
experience. Against Hungary at the World Cup and Olympics, we held
our own until the fourth quarter, and that's experience, veterans
knowing how to finish games."</TE>
<TE>   Castle Up in the Air</TE>
<TE>   The Ice Castle International Training Center in Lake Arrowhead,
which has been home to an impressive lineup of skaters and coaches,
faces an uncertain future after Carol Probst's decision to put the
facility up for sale.</TE>
<TE>   Probst, who owned and managed it for 20 years with her late
husband, Walter, hopes the next owner will maintain it as a skating
center.</TE>
<TE>   However, there are no guarantees the 11.4-acre parcel, which is
zoned for residential/special use, will be spared the indignity of
becoming something else.</TE>
<TE>   Here and There</TE>
<TE>   Olympic figure skating gold medalist Sarah Hughes added stops in
Long Beach and Anaheim to her Champions on Ice schedule. Hughes, 17,
didn't commit to the full four-month tour because she wanted to
finish school and take a breather after a hectic season. The cast,
which includes six-time U.S. champion Michelle Kwan, Olympic silver
medalist and world champion Irina Slutskaya, and men's Olympic
medalists Alexei Yagudin, Evgeni Plushenko and Tim Goebel, will
perform one show at the Long Beach Arena on July 11 and two at the
Arrowhead Pond on July 13.</TE>
<TE>   Five gymnasts who won a combined 40 Olympic medals will be
inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame tonight in
Oklahoma City. They are Polina Astakhova and Boris Shakhlin of
Ukraine, Keiko Ikeda of Japan, Agnes Keleti of Hungary and Daniela
Silivas of Romania. Berthe Villancher, a former official, will be
inducted posthumously.</TE>
<TE>   Russian pole vaulter Svetlana Feofanova set a European women's
record of 15-7 1/4 (4.76 meters) last weekend in France. That's the
world's best height for a woman this season.</TE>

<HD>The Ranch Has Animal Magnetism</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>BUENA VISTA, Mexico</DL>
<LD>Baja California is a land of many wonders, and adding to its charm
are its many colorful characters, most of whom have come to regard
the desert frontier as the ultimate escape from complicated life
north of the border.</LD>
<LD>   One of the most wonderful places is the East Cape region, on the
Sea of Cortez about 75 miles north of Cabo San Lucas. One of the most
charming East Cape resorts is Rancho Leonero, just south of Buena
Vista, atop a bluff overlooking the strikingly beautiful sea.</LD>
<LD>   The Ranch, as it is called, is fronted by a reef teeming with
small fish and flanked on both sides by long, sandy beaches. Beyond
the reef are larger, more powerful fish that lure anglers from all
over the world.</LD>
<TE>   But the Ranch, like any of the nearby resorts, wouldn't be the
sleepy haven it is without its cast of characters, not all of whom
are human.</TE>
<TE>   There's Nick the dog, for example. His owner, a fighter pilot
during the Vietnam war, is a semi-retired accountant from the
Portland area. He and his wife spend a few months of the year
unwinding at their home down the beach.</TE>
<TE>   They always bring Nick, whose daily routine includes an evening
swim, in front of guests on the patio, who watch in amazement as the
furry black mixed-breed paws his way over and beyond the reef, often
venturing more than 300 yards out, barking at nothing and everything
as he goes.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's Ranger the parrot, whose owner, Roy Baldwin, was an
executive for a San Diego real estate development firm before coming
here 10 years ago. He fell in love with the simplicity of Baja life
and never went back.</TE>
<TE>   To him, Ranger is man's best friend. The bird turned 29 recently.
Baldwin treated him to a steak and French fries at a restaurant in
nearby La Ribera.</TE>
<TE>   "Ranger's not a bird. He's human, or at least he thinks he is,"
Baldwin says, adding that the parrot insists on actually walking into
a restaurant, as people do, and that his favorite food is spicy
chicken wings.</TE>
<TE>   As for Baldwin, after his initial visit, he was hired as chief
financial officer at the Ranch, and adopted the nickname, "Senior
Divertido," or "Mr. Fun." He and Ranger moved into a trailer at the
edge of a sprawling arroyo, with a glimpsing view of the emerald sea.</TE>
<TE>   He had found paradise, but also an environment where peace and
serenity should never be taken for granted. In the summer of 1998,
Hurricane Isis roared up the gulf and flooded the arroyo. The furious
current swept away the trailer and most of Baldwin's possessions.</TE>
<TE>   In a bound diary of his ordeal, which he shares with guests at the
bar, is the passage:</TE>
<TE>   "There's pieces of my place strewn all over the beach from here to
La Ribera. One of the homeowners found my safe on the beach. Thinking
he had found buried treasure he carried it home on his ATV and broke
it open. I'll bet he was surprised when the only thing he found
inside was a picture of me."</TE>
<TE>   Today, Baldwin, 49, lives on higher ground in La Ribera, a small
town of mostly fishermen and their families. He spends his work days
managing money, updating the hotel Web site (www.rancholeonero.com)
and keeping a constant eye on the weather.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll never go back to the States," he says. "All I need is a
Friday night on a freeway up there to appreciate dodging cows on the
roads down here."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wayward livestock is a Baja trademark, but here at the Ranch the
real cattle call is the one that takes place each morning at dawn,
when guests finish breakfast and rush to the pier to catch their
rides to the fishing grounds.</TE>
<TE>   The East Cape, like Cabo San Lucas, offers some of the finest
fishing in the world for a variety of offshore and inshore species,
notably marlin, tuna, dorado and roosterfish. Unlike Cabo San Lucas,
the East Cape has retained its Mexican flavor. It has not been
over-developed, has no traffic, no unsightly high-rises. It boasts
only a glimmer of nightlife, in the small town of Los Barriles.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, its selling points remain, simply, the solitude (hotel
rooms have neither phones nor TVs), a bountiful sea and some of the
most dazzling sunrises imaginable.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some bugs in our room, but other than that it's just
perfect," says Jeff Ziegler, 47, visiting from Denver with his wife,
Audrey. "We like it because it is so quiet."</TE>
<TE>   The fleet at the Ranch includes cruisers and super pangas
(center-console outboards with swivel seats), though kayaks are also
available and their use is becoming increasingly popular.</TE>
<TE>   Greeting the customers most mornings, either at breakfast or at
the pier, is Rancho Leonero Resort owner John Ireland. Like Baldwin,
Ireland fell in love with the place during his first visit, as a
prospective buyer, in 1979. Previously, it had been the seasonal home
of Gil Powell, a wildlife cinematographer and big-game hunter known
for his movie shoots in Africa.</TE>
<TE>   The locals called Powell "El Leonero," or "the one who knows
lions."</TE>
<TE>   During the late 1950s and '60s, long before the paved highway
opened the floodgates for tourists, many of Hollywood's rich and
famous would fly down in private planes, and return with tales of
marathon battles with marlin and other game fish. Among the frequent
visitors were John Wayne, Errol Flynn and Bing Crosby.</TE>
<TE>   Powell died in 1974 and when Ireland came he found the home in
shambles. But that hardly mattered. He saw the potential, both above
and below the water. The home, and much of the surrounding property
that was also for sale, was on a small point exposed to sea breezes
that brought at least some relief during the blazing summer months.
Behind it was a vast and spectacular desert.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the point was the long, rocky reef, which now offers
tourists, especially those with children, an enjoyable alternative to
fishing. Ireland, 54, says his first snorkeling trip over the reef,
when he came face to face with a school of golden jacks, was what
made him decide to follow through with the purchase.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just a magical experience," he recalls. "The hair was
literally standing on my arms and I really felt like this was a
special spot, like a national park or something."</TE>
<TE>   That it was, but the work that went into taking the raunch out of
the Ranch was taxing. Ireland, a developer in San Diego and Arizona,
did much of the work himself, using mules to haul rocks from inland
quarries and hiring specialists to ensure there would be ample well
water to sustain a hotel, which there was.</TE>
<TE>   He turned Powell's home into a hotel with five rooms. His small
cruiser became his sole sportfisher, which he anchored beyond the
reef. He rowed clients out and personally took them fishing.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, he hired a Mexican captain and other locals to do work
around the hotel. He had built his fleet to three boats before he had
his first serious brush with Mother Nature. Hurricane Kiko raged over
the region in 1989, severely damaging his boats, which had been
hauled onto the beach, and ripping the thatched roofs off the hotel
rooms.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked like an atomic bomb went off," Ireland says with a
sigh. "We got it right on the nose."</TE>
<TE>   Like Baldwin, Ireland wasn't deterred. Today, the Ranch has 35
air-conditioned rooms, an immaculate courtyard, a small swimming
pool, a bar and a restaurant with a patio that affords a panoramic
view of the glimmering sea.</TE>
<TE>   And of Nick the dog, paddling happily toward the horizon.</TE>

<HD>A Fever Pitch</HD>
<DH>South Korea is in the grips of stunning final-eight run by
its team, while other nations come to grips with World Cup
elimination</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>The banner hanging from the Miyagi Stadium stands read, "Godzilla
Comes To Kick!"--an intriguing substitution suggestion Japan Coach
Philippe Troussier should have considered more seriously during his
team's 1-0 second-round loss to Turkey.</LD>
<LD>   According to the scouting reports, Godzilla is quite the physical
presence inside the penalty area. A little slow, perhaps, but tough
to defend in the open field. And what about Mothra, who also didn't
play a minute?</LD>
<LD>   It's common knowledge throughout the soccer world: Mothra is very,
very good in the air.</LD>
<TE>   Troussier decided to resign after Japan's elimination from the
World Cup. And, of course, he had to. A coach who doesn't use all the
resources at his avail hasn't done the complete job.</TE>
<TE>   Only one sci-fi monster has been unleashed during this tournament.
It is called Fevernova, and it has wreaked havoc on the countries of
Japan and South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   No one expected it when 32 soccer teams arrived here in late May.
Everyone realized that soccer can be an unpredictable game and that
every World Cup has its share of upsets. But everyone also knew that
once a World Cup reaches the second round, the ageless forces of
nature--Italy's defense, Argentina's grit--begin to exert themselves
and the tournament rocks back into its customary rhythms.</TE>
<TE>   That hasn't happened here, not by a longshot, and there are many
of those still hanging around in the quarterfinals. Brazil, England
and Germany somehow made it to the final eight, but everywhere else,
there has been panic on the pitch and hysteria in the streets.</TE>
<TE>   Blame it on the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Blame it on the Fevernova.</TE>
<TE>   Every four years, the World Cup rolls out a new official ball.
This year's model, the Adidas Fevernova, has been especially
insidious, on several levels. First there is its color: a slightly
goldish tint, apparently designed for its subliminal potential,
making defenders and attackers alike drool like Pavlov's dog as they
vie for the golden prize at the end of the line.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the hallucinogenic logo design, which looks like a
spinning Ninja weapon and creates the optical illusion that it is
wobbling like a knuckleball every time it is lofted in the air.
Defenders trying to head the thing have complained about it from the
start. England's David Beckham, who is paid by Adidas, raves that
this ball is more accurate than any previously used in a World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Try telling that to Christian Vieri, whose shank from the six-yard
line against South Korea will be haunting Italians for the next four
years, or generations.</TE>
<TE>   Once the Fevernova started bouncing, all bets were off. It began
by caroming crazily off the backside of France's Emmanuel Petit to
Senegal's Papa Bouba Diop to the back of the net, and off we went.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks later, the fever continues to spread by the minute.</TE>
<TE>   You cannot sleep in Seoul on the night of a South Korea match.
After the overtime upset of Italy, the red-clad masses clogging the
streets were still cheering, still honking car horns and still
banging drums well past 1 in the morning.</TE>
<TE>   You can, however, get a seat on the subway. From kickoff to final
whistle, the streets and subway stations are ghost-town empty, with
an entire nation, it seems, hunkered indoors to root on the Reds. Or
inside makeshift "virtual stadiums"--temporary bleachers erected
around a massive television screen, such as the one next to the
international media center. For South Korea-Italy, it was packed to
capacity and then some, with hundreds spilling out onto the sidewalk,
all wearing red T-shirts, all on their toes and craning to catch a
glimpse of the action.</TE>
<TE>   Those red T-shirts, by the way, are the hottest souvenirs at the
World Cup. Some are short-sleeved, some are sleeveless, but all carry
the same off-kilter slogan: "BE THE REDS."</TE>
<TE>   It's very easy for a foreigner to fit in here. Just peel off a few
thousand won for a T-shirt, join the crowd, be the Reds and root
enthusiastically for "Korea Team Fighting," as the Korea
Telephone-sponsored advertisements tout the home team.</TE>
<TE>   Or you can wrap yourself in a massive, full-color silk-screened
Guus Hiddink bib. A man outside the media center was selling these
bibs--as big as beach towels--out of his van. You buy this cloth
image of the South Korea coach, the pores on his face as large as
sesame seeds, and then you tie the upper corners around your neck and
walk away trying not to trip on the bottom corners.</TE>
<TE>   Hiddink has become a cult hero here, with South Korean government
and soccer officials already offering him honorary citizenship, free
first-class air travel for four years, free beer for life and,
possibly, a statue in his honor. The newspaper Chosun Ilbo has also
proposed giving Hiddink his own Korean name: "Hie Dung-gu"--which
means "happy while climbing to the top."</TE>
<TE>   There's another name being planned for Luciano Gaucci, president
of the Italian soccer club Perugia. Ahn Jung-Hwan, who scored the
winning goal for South Korea against Italy, plays for Perugia--or, at
least, used to. Gaucci, deeply disturbed by the result, announced
that Perugia was immediately releasing Ahn, saying, "Ahn will never
play for Perugia again.... What did you expect me to do? That I would
keep a player who ruined Italian football?"</TE>
<TE>   The fever can get ugly, and it can be dangerous. In Suwon, Spain's
overtime struggle with Ireland had Spanish television broadcasters
all but swooning as their team saw star forward Raul limp to the
sideline, saw another player red-carded, saw Ireland equalize on a
90th-minute penalty to send the match into overtime and, eventually,
a shootout.</TE>
<TE>   As exhausted players from both sides took turns missing their
penalties--two Spanish players missed the net entirely--one
broadcaster appeared to be doubled over in pain. Finally, when Gaizka
Mendieta converted to clinch it for Spain, the broadcaster leaped
from his chair and began hyperventilating while screaming in between
gulps of oxygen.</TE>
<TE>   "GOAL! GOAL! GOAL! GOAL! GOAL! GOOOOOOOOAAALLL!!!"</TE>
<TE>   He was still screaming when he picked up his chair, raised it over
his head and brought it down hard on the concrete beneath his feet,
again and again, hammering the metal legs so hard they almost bent.</TE>
<TE>   "GOAL! GOAL! GOAL! GOAL! GOAL! GOOOOOOOOAAALLL!!!"</TE>
<TE>   The fever doesn't subside, even if your team already has. A
half-hour after the Spain-Ireland match, writers waiting for a
shuttle bus had their postmatch banter interrupted by the lilting
strains of a soulful, mournful tune.</TE>
<TE>   Trudging out toward the street were three green-shirted Ireland
fans, dealing with the trauma best they could. One was playing the
bagpipes. The others flanked him on either side, upper lips stiffened
and eyes fighting back tears, saying nothing as they stared out into
the evening, looking ahead to 2006 because it was too wrenching to
look back.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, the fever is the only thing that gets you through the
night.</TE>

was ranked third in Student Sports magazine's final national poll for
the winter.</LD>
<TE>   In other personnel moves:</TE>
<TE>   * Ray Rivera, pitching coach at City Section runner-up Sylmar, has
been promoted to varsity baseball coach. He replaces Gary Donatella,

<HD>Senegalese Will Try to Put a Spell on Turks</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>After taking on, and silencing, 45,000 screaming Japanese fans in the
second round, Turkey's spoiler of a World Cup team braces for an
altogether different challenge in Saturday's quarterfinal against
Senegal.</LD>
<LD>   Beware the juju men?</LD>
<LD>   The theory has been advanced that World Cup rookie Senegal has
advanced this far, past France and Denmark into the final eight, due
largely to the assist the Teranga Lions have received from the juju
men, or witch doctors, back home.</LD>
<TE>   For the record, Senegal's coach, Bruno Metsu, says he doesn't
believe in the power of juju--and doesn't believe his players do
either.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe two or three are susceptible to that kind of thing," Metsu
told reporters in Osaka this week, "but the rest just treat it as a
joke."</TE>
<TE>   Several of Senegal's players, such as Sylvain Ndiaye and Habib
Beye, were born and raised in France.</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine their reaction," Senegal captain Aliou Cisse said, "if we
killed a chicken in the dressing room before the match."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, Metsu pointed out, if juju really put a spell on teams
playing Senegal, "We'd have won the African Nations Cup and the World
Cup ages ago."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday in Osaka, Senegal tries to go where no other African
nation has gone--to the semifinals of the World Cup. With its 2-1
sudden-death victory over Sweden in the second round, Senegal joined
Cameroon in 1990 as the only African teams to reach the
quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey, which ruined co-host Japan's "Blue Heaven" party with its
1-0 second-round victory in Miyagi, stands in Senegal's path. Turkey
too is new to such rarified turf; the Turks' only other World Cup
appearance was in 1954.</TE>
<TE>   The playing styles are as dramatic as they come. Senegal has
charmed neutral fans around the world with its fast-breaking,
free-flowing form of soccer. Turkey, meanwhile, conspires to drain
the life from a match and an opponent, as Japan bitterly discovered.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, many regard Senegal a favorite in the match, a role
the Senegalese would rather not play.</TE>
<TE>   "We have always been outsiders, and that's how we want to remain,"
goalkeeper Tony Sylva said. "We don't consider ourselves favorites.
We aren't going to change. Above all, we respect Turkey."</TE>
<TE>   Senegal striker El Hadji Diouf said the goal is to "prolong the
adventure and do something an African country has never done
before--reach the semifinals."</TE>

<TE>*--*
Saturday, 4:30 a.m. PDT, at Gwangju, South Korea
TV: ESPN, Ch. 34. Delayed: Ch. 46, 2:30 p.m
How they got here: Senegal, second place in Group A, defeated Sweden
in the second round on Henri Camara's overtime goal, 2-1. Turkey,
second place in Group C, defeated Japan in the second round, 1-0
Senegal update: Senegal has been delighting old fans and creating new
ones with its adventurous, attacking style. After the Senegalese
squandered a three-goal lead in a 3-3 draw with Uruguay, many in the
media dredged up the stereotypes about African soccer--i.e., African
teams aren't defensively disciplined enough for extended runs at the
World Cup. Senegal took care of that cliche by rallying from a 1-0
deficit against a strong Swedish team and winning in the 118th minute
on a goal off the post by Camara. Only one other African nation had
advanced this far in a World Cup, 1990 quarterfinalist Cameroon
Turkey update: The Turks have progressed further than expected,
especially with star forward Hakan Suker failing to score in four
matches. Suker, who has 35 goals in 77 national-team appearances,
hasn't scored for Turkey since April, when he managed a goal during
an exhibition match against Chile. Winger Hasan Sas has scored two
goals. The Turks played Japan without Emre Asik and Emre Belozoglu
because of suspensions. Both will return for the quarterfinal
Outlook: Turkey already ruined Japan's party, so Senegal had best be
wary</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A lot has been said and written about Jack Buck's broadcasting skills
this week. He'll be long remembered for his distinctive voice and an
ability to say so much with so few words.</LD>
<LD>   But Buck, who died Tuesday night in St. Louis, will be equally
remembered for being a good person.</LD>
<LD>   His son Joe Buck said, "He always emphasized three things--be a
good person, be a good father and be a good son."</LD>
<TE>   It was a plus that his son also succeeded in sports broadcasting.
Joe Buck is Fox's lead baseball play-by-play announcer and this year
will become the network's lead football play-by-play announcer.</TE>
<TE>   Vin Scully summed up Jack Buck this way: "He was a gruff-voiced
guy with a big heart."</TE>
<TE>   Tim McCarver said, "Jack Buck had more heart than talent, and he
was one of the most talented broadcasters ever in this business. He
was the most gallant man I've ever met."</TE>
<TE>   Dan Dierdorf, one of Buck's closest friends, talked about his
generosity.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember once we were sitting at the head table at a charity
dinner, maybe 20 years ago," Dierdorf said. "There were six waiters
taking care of the head table, and he tipped each one $20.</TE>
<TE>   "That's just the way he was. I've never known a better tipper."</TE>
<TE>   Referring to the public service held at Busch Stadium on Thursday,
Dierdorf said, "If only the waiters and waitresses Jack has
generously tipped over the years showed up, there would still be
50,000 people there."</TE>
<TE>   Also endearing him to the people in St. Louis were his annual
Christmas Day radio broadcasts from his home. All kinds of people
would stop by to take part. Buck seemingly knew everyone in St.
Louis, and certainly everyone knew him.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. sportscaster Scott St. James, who co-hosted a general talk
show with Buck at St. Louis' KMOX before coming to Los Angeles in
1979 to go to work for Gene and Jackie Autry at KMPC (710), recalls
how Buck could immediately put someone he met at ease.</TE>
<TE>   "He was known wherever he went in St. Louis," St. James said. "But
he would always introduce himself. 'Hello, Jack Buck,' he would say
as he put out his hand."</TE>
<TE>   At restaurants, when someone would come over to his table to ask
for an autograph, he'd get up and go back to that person's table to
introduce himself and shake hands with everyone there.</TE>
<TE>   From a reporter's point of view, Buck was always accommodating and
gracious.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, he became the lead baseball play-by-play announcer at CBS
after Brent Musburger was fired. I was headed for an assignment in
New York and wanted to stop in St. Louis on the way back to Los
Angeles to interview Buck.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals would be playing a night game on the Saturday that I
planned to visit. I called him a week, maybe two, in advance to set
up the interview.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure," Buck said. "I'll meet you in the executive lobby at the
stadium at 5 o'clock."</TE>
<TE>   That's all there was to it. No "check with the PR department" or
anything like that.</TE>
<TE>   And when I got to the lobby, there he was, as promised.</TE>
<TE>   "Come on, I'll show you around," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The tour included introductions to everyone from the receptionists
in the office to the elevator operator to Cardinal players to
then-manager Whitey Herzog to writers in the press box to an
Anheuser-Busch vice president and a Missouri state senator.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody got exactly the same courteous greeting, be it the
elevator operator or the state senator. Everyone was the same, as far
as Buck was concerned.</TE>
<TE>   After making the rounds, we talked in the press box dining area
for about an hour. Then it was time for Buck to go to work. I asked
if I should sit in the press box.</TE>
<TE>   Said Buck: "No, no. You're sitting with us."</TE>
<TE>   During the entire game I sat between Buck and his longtime
broadcast partner Mike Shannon.</TE>
<TE>   I've thought a lot about that night this week. I don't think I've
ever enjoyed a ballgame more.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcasting Pioneer</TE>
<TE>   There was another recent passing of a longtime sports broadcaster.
Liz Shanov died June 9 after a three-year battle with brain cancer.
She was 49.</TE>
<TE>   Shanov didn't enjoy the stature of Jack Buck, but she toiled in
the trenches for 27 years as a radio sports reporter. After
graduating from Fordham and starting out at WCBS in New York, she
came to Southern California in 1979 and worked as a freelancer for
ABC, CBS and Associated Press radio networks.</TE>
<TE>   She was going into men's locker rooms to do postgame interviews
long before it became the norm for female reporters. And she always
handled the assignment with class.</TE>
<TE>   Shanov produced and hosted a Dodger talk show aimed at kids, "Too
Cool Blue," for KXTA (1150) in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Shanov, a Monrovia resident since 1991, is survived by her
husband, Larry Marotta, who heads the television division of the
American Armed Forces Radio and Television Service.</TE>
<TE>   A Salute to Women</TE>
<TE>   ESPN is offering nearly 40 hours of women's sports-related
programming during what it is calling "Women and Sports Weekend"
today through Sunday in honor of the 30th anniversary of Title IX.</TE>
<TE>   A highlight of the weekend will be an excellent one-hour
documentary, "On the Basis of Sex: The Battle of Title IX," Saturday
at 5 p.m. The show presents a balanced look at all aspects
surrounding the controversial gender-equality law that was signed
June 23, 1972.</TE>
<TE>   The documentary will be followed at 6 p.m. by a live "town
meeting" panel discussion of Title IX. Reporters took part in a
conference call with some of the participants this week, and judging
from that, the discussion should be lively.</TE>
<TE>   Switching Stations</TE>
<TE>   Channel 4 has announced that it has acquired the rights to the Los
Angeles Marathon, beginning with the 2003 race on March 2. The
marathon was previously televised by Channel 13.</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   The U.S.-Germany World Cup match, televised live at 4:30 a.m.
today, will be replayed by Channel 7 at 3 p.m. Saturday. Most ABC
stations will show it at 10:30 a.m.... The official NBA Finals video
and DVD won't be out until July 23, but Fox Sports Net has put
together a one-hour special, "A Dynasty Defined," on the Lakers'
season. It makes its debut on Fox Sports Net at 7 p.m. Monday, with a
number of replays to follow on Fox Sports Net and Fox Sports Net 2.
Paul Sunderland serves as the host....Turner Sports and the PGA of
America announced an agreement Thursday that extends TNT's coverage
of the PGA Championship through 2011. The agreement also calls for
Turner Sports Interactive to manage PGA.com.</TE>
<TE>   In Closing</TE>
<TE>   Veteran sportscaster Ed Arnold has been confined to his home in
Fountain Valley since May 9 because of multiple heart problems--a
viral infection, cardiac myopathy, an irregular heartbeat and a leaky
valve. He says he is making progress and hopes to be back on his feet
soon.</TE>
<TE>   For more than 30 years, Arnold has served as the emcee of the
opening ceremony of the Southern California Special Olympics, but he
missed last Friday night's ceremony leading into the weekend
competition at Long Beach State. Bill Macdonald filled in after
serving as Fox Sports Net's host of the Laker victory parade and
championship celebration earlier in the day. Macdonald was back at
Long Beach State early Saturday to serve as the emcee of the Special
Olympics' "Breakfast of Champions."</TE>
<TE>   It was typical of Macdonald, always first in line to donate his
time to a charitable cause.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Labeling linesmen at the World Cup "a disaster," the president of
soccer's governing body said in an interview published Thursday that
he would propose changes in the selection, training and designation
of match officials for future editions of the competition.</LD>
<LD>   In an interview with the Milan daily Gazzetta dello Sport, FIFA
President Sepp Blatter also said certain refereeing decisions against
Italy at the World Cup caused him to "suffer deeply."</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously the dozens of competitions staged by FIFA over the last
four years have been insufficient to 'break in' the referees and
linesmen. The former have been quite good, the latter a disaster,
especially on calling offsides," Blatter was quoted as saying.</LD>
<TE>   Much of Italy's media, including Gazzetta dello Sport, the
country's top-selling sports newspaper, have cried foul against what
they said was a FIFA conspiracy against the "Azzurri" team.</TE>
<TE>   Three-time champion Italy was eliminated from the competition on
Tuesday in a 2-1 upset by World Cup co-host South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Two episodes during the match--playmaker Francesco Totti's being
sent off for diving and an offsides call on an overtime goal by
midfielder Damiano Tommasi--provoked outrage in Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Blatter denied any conspiracy but conceded several dubious
decisions had damaged the Italians.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, through exceptional circumstances and
coincidences, numerous and consecutive errors were concentrated on
the Italian team," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A South Korean's game-winning World Cup goal against Italy has set
off a furor between his Italian club team and the Asian Football
Confederation.</TE>
<TE>   After Ahn Jung-hwan scored the overtime goal to eliminate Italy,
the owner of Perugia of the top Italian division said Ahn would be
cut.</TE>
<TE>   That angered the confederation, which threatened to blacklist
Perugia if the team gets rid of Ahn, meaning it would tell Asian
players to stay away from the Italian club.</TE>
<TE>   "I've warned all football officials in Japan, China and Korea
about sending players to Perugia," confederation head Peter Velappan
said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The United States is an underdeveloped nation. Just ask Pele.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to the "beautiful game" that made the Brazilian star
famous--he's still soccer's most popular figure 25 years after his
last goal--America still isn't a global power. Of course, the way the
United States has performed at this World Cup, great things might be
ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't realize all the youngsters in the USA who all play
soccer," Pele said. "There are 25 million kids ranging from the age
of 8 to 25 playing in the States, and the No. 1 pastime of young
Americans is soccer. It has great potential.</TE>
<TE>   "But there are other important things. In this World Cup, the
second-level team has played very good football and that is very
important for the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "It is important to give more attention to the sport in the United
States and South Korea and the underdeveloped countries in football.
This will be good for the future of the sport."</TE>

<HD>Soccer Is Kicking at Wrong Door</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So sorry to be the naysayer in a nation that Tuesday breathlessly
proclaimed soccer to be the once and again "it" sport--all the
newspapers said so, and if we printed it, you'd hope it were
true--but the idea is just ridiculous.</LD>
<LD>   Actually, I'm not sorry at all. The only thing sorry here is the
way so many smart editors at reputable newspapers, including this
one, people who should have known better, bought wholesale into the
notion that soccer has arrived because of the U.S. team's historic
run in the World Cup.</LD>
<LD>   That's nonsense. Soccer is not, will not become, will never be the
incredible sporting, cultural, even political influence it is in
virtually every other nation on the planet. I would love it were it
otherwise; I daresay I am one of the few people in this country who
has willingly watched more than two games from this World Cup not
involving the United States or Mexico--including the dreadful 8-0
German victory over Saudi Arabia and, for reasons I still can't
explain, three games involving Belgium.</LD>
<TE>   To explain why I'm convinced that pro soccer and a wider soccer
culture is an idea going nowhere fast in the U.S., allow me the
liberty of reporting from the front lines of what the breathless
press would have you believe is the crucible of a new generation of
soccer fans--the youth soccer leagues.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the kids play soccer. At least those who notice the ball. A
fair number are chasing butterflies or scouring the field for
four-leaf clovers.</TE>
<TE>   At any rate, it's all totally irrelevant, because the great
majority of fathers out there don't care if you're a swell soccer
player. What they care about is if you learn to play baseball,
basketball and football.</TE>
<TE>   My middle child, a 5-year-old boy, played soccer last fall, T-ball
this spring. Soccer was mellow, funny, even comical, the way it
should be when 5-year-olds are involved. The first T-ball practice
included serious drills and ran 1 hour 45 minutes--that's practice,
not a game, and that's for T-ball, where in our league you don't even
keep score. I can't even tell you how many dads insisted this spring
on pitching--overhand--to the 5- and 6-year-old T-ballers instead of
letting them develop their skills by hitting off the tee.</TE>
<TE>   As the kids get older, and here I'm talking in particular about
boys, 10 or 11 years old, there develops immense pressure to turn
away from soccer--to pursue baseball, basketball and football.</TE>
<TE>   The truly intense pressure, incidentally, comes not from adult
role models--teachers and coaches--but from peers, the other fifth-,
sixth- and seventh-grade boys. Those boys who stay in soccer are
called, derisively, "soccer monkeys."</TE>
<TE>   Then comes high school. I will say this bluntly, and this may well
be the crux of the problem, the real reason soccer has no chance
here: Unlike the rest of the world, being a high school boys' varsity
soccer player in the U.S. is not the way to get girls. Being a
football player, a basketball player, even a baseball player,
strutting down the hallway on game day in your jersey--that's the way
to make the play.</TE>
<TE>   That's the way it always has been, and always will be.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, I readily concede that the atmosphere surrounding the
Women's World Cup here in 1999 was fantastic, the crowd of 90,185 at
the Rose Bowl outstanding, the Brandi Chastain snapshot, sports bra
and all, a singular moment in our sporting history. But that's all it
was--a moment, nothing more.</TE>
<TE>   Check the latest from the women's pro soccer league, the
WUSA--average announced attendance is down this year to 7,237 a game,
from 8,104 in its first year. Look, even 8,104 is awful. I was in
college at Northwestern at the onset of the Wildcats' 34-game
football losing streak, so I know a bad product when I see one, but
even the 1981 team, a candidate for the worst in college football
history (0-11, including a 64-0 loss to Iowa and 61-14 pounding by
Michigan State) drew an average of 24,370 fans to a decrepit Dyche
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   That's more than three times what the women's pro games are
drawing now--and this is three years after the photos of Chastain
prompted a round of "soccer has arrived" stories.</TE>
<TE>   Truly, it hadn't. And it won't. Ever.</TE>
<TE>   Sorry. Well, not really. The overriding obligation of this
newspaper is to deliver the truth.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Someone needs to check the wall behind the Colorado Rockies' humidor.
It seems to have come unplugged.</LD>
<LD>   Todd Zeile hit a three-run homer in the 10th inning and the
Rockies outslugged the New York Yankees, 14-11, Thursday to close out
the highest-scoring three-game series in Coors Field history.</LD>
<LD>   Todd Hollandsworth hit a grand slam as the Rockies overcame an 8-2
deficit, rallying after Roger Clemens was hit in the right forearm by
a line drive and forced out of the game.</LD>
<TE>   "Anybody who left after the fifth inning ought to be ashamed of
themselves," Colorado Manager Clint Hurdle said.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado's use of a humidor to store its baseballs this season had
helped drop scoring at Coors Field by four runs per game from a year
ago, but the Rockies and Yankees quickly put an end to that.</TE>
<TE>   The two teams combined for 70 runs, along with 95 hits and 15 home
runs. The previous record for runs in a three-game series at Coors
was 64 between the Rockies and Montreal on May 1-3, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess the humidor's broken," Hurdle said. "It's got a leak."</TE>

<DH>Home run balls hit into San Francisco Bay have become quite
the collectors' items</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The San Francisco Giants are batting and Barry Bonds steps to the
plate. Far away, on the other side of the right-field wall, Steve
Jackson hunkers down in his orange kayak.</LD>
<LD>   There is a crack of the bat, the roar from the Giants' sellout
crowd at Pacific Bell Park, and then the "plunk!" as the baseball
hits the water about 20 yards away, and bobs like a cork. From over
his left shoulder, Jackson hears the sound of a splash. Someone has
jumped from the walkway behind the stadium into the brackish green
San Francisco Bay to try to get to the ball first.</LD>
<LD>   If we weren't on the water, you would call it a horse race to the
horsehide. The jumper has a better angle, but Jackson has two
important advantages. One, Jackson is an expert at retrieving
floating baseballs that are hit into the bay for home runs. Two, the
other guy can't swim.</LD>
<TE>   Jackson wins the race to the ball, but not without incident. His
kayak tips over and spills him into the chilly water. Abandoning his
paddles, Jackson hangs on to his kayak with his right hand and holds
his prized Bonds baseball with his left, treading water until he is
scooped up by his friends in another boat.</TE>
<TE>   The episode ends differently for the loser: The jumper is rescued
by kayakers and carried to shore on the stern of the craft, his legs
and feet dangling in the water, the catch of the day heading for the
fish market.</TE>
<TE>   "I seen the guy jump," Jackson says later. "Then I paddled like
hell. Lucky I got there first."</TE>
<TE>   And so it goes out here on McCovey Cove, where baseball isn't the
same game. Here, it has a different spin to it, a separate
water-based reality. For instance, a floater is not a knuckleball,
it's a kayak. The bases are loaded and so are the people on the party
boat. Home runs are not home runs, but Splash Hits.</TE>
<TE>   Since the ballpark opened in 2000, there have been 24 Splash Hits.
That's 24 baseballs that have cleared the right field wall as home
runs and dropped into the water. However, 20 is regarded as the
official number because the other four were hit by players from the
opposing team and the Giants don't count them. Call it the home water
accounting advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds has 18 Splash Hits, former Giant Felipe Crespo has two and
the other four were accomplished by Luis Gonzalez, who hit two,
Arizona Diamondback teammate Mark Grace and Todd Hundley when he was
with the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   As it turns out, it is a good day for Bonds, who launched two home
runs into McCovey Cove. It is also a very good day for Jackson, 44,
of Alameda, who snagged both baseballs, bringing his career total to
nine, by far the most for the souvenir hunters who stalk the cove.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that's a record that may not ever be broken," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From the water on the other side of the right-field wall at Pac
Bell Park, you can't see the dugouts and you can't see the field, but
you can sure hear Rebekah Myers of the Tulare Chapter of the Future
Farmers of America as she sings the national anthem. The Muchacha
flies its stars and stripes and its passengers stand ... as still as
they can.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, you also can't see the game from McCovey Cove. But you
can sure hear it. In fact, if you couldn't hear it, Jackson would be
out of work.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, Jackson has two jobs. One of them is repairing boats at
the docks in Alameda. His other job is retrieving baseballs from
their watery landing place in McCovey Cove after they clear the wall
at Pac Bell Park.</TE>
<TE>   It's a labor of love, sort of, says Jackson, who retired at the
end of last season only to make a comeback.</TE>
<TE>   "My girlfriend said, 'Enough is enough,' but this is fun and to
get Barry Bonds' home run balls, that's a high," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, there is the commerce issue. Bonds' home run balls
don't get as much attention for the souvenir value as their dollar
value. Jackson, in fact, has an agent, who auctions the baseballs on
the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Baseballs hit for home runs by Bonds are typically worth anywhere
from $3,000-$5,000 in auction, Doug Allen, president of the company
that represents Jackson, MastroNet, one of the largest auction houses
for sports memorabilia.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds' 70th home run ball last season, which was not a Splash Hit,
went for $52,500 in a MastroNet auction.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, people value the more historic balls the most," Allen
said.</TE>
<TE>   There aren't many trade secrets involved in Jackson's line of
work. He follows the game on a transistor radio and listens for the
telltale roar of the crowd. Then he paddles as fast as he can.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Port of San Francisco barred power boats in the area,
McCovey Cove was sometimes a lawless body of water.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said he once had a boat run over his bow while all were
scrambling for a Splash Hit. But another incident was worse: After
falling out of his kayak, Jackson was nearly run over by two
"jokesters" in power boats.</TE>
<TE>   "But that's the chance you take out here," said Jackson, who says
he has been to 95 Giant games in the water at McCovey Cove, waiting
for home run balls to drop out of the sky.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes when the weather is cold and the fog covers McCovey Cove
like a big, gray sock, or when the water is choppy and it gets cold,
Jackson isn't as big a baseball fan.</TE>
<TE>   "It gets old after a while," he says. "We had an 18-inning game
and I was freezing out here and somebody invited me on board their
boat and I got some food. That was nice."</TE>
<TE>   When the Giants built Pac Bell Park, part of the attraction was
the scenery outside the stadium in the part of San Francisco Bay the
team named after Hall of Fame slugger Willie McCovey. It quickly
became party boat central and attracted so many boats, you could walk
across them the length of the wall.</TE>
<TE>   Some boats flew Giant flags. Some were roped to barges covered
with artificial turf for a putting green. Another boat had a barbecue
grill in its stern. When Bonds was chasing Mark McGwire's home run
record last year--he wound up breaking McGwire's mark with 73--there
was a virtual flotilla in McCovey Cove and Major League Baseball sent
a representative to authenticate home runs by Bonds by using balls
with identification marks on them whenever he came to bat.</TE>
<TE>   It's only standard-issue balls that are hitting the water these
days, but they might as well be floating dollar bills to Jackson.
There is even a McCovey Cove web site (www.mccovey-cove.com),
complete with biographies on the guys who get the balls and a list of
every Splash Hit.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson is a star in this field, with more pictures of him than
Bonds on the site. He is no stranger to the Giants' front office.</TE>
<TE>   "He's always out there," said Alfonso Felder, the Giants'
transportation director. "We know him just like we know some of our
season-ticket holders."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson is getting some competition. Starting this month, the
Giants will continue their popular practice of unleashing Portuguese
water dogs during weekend games. Their assignment: Leap from the deck
of the Good Ship Jollipup and retrieve any balls hit into McCovey
Cove.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Jackson, the dogs get paid in treats. The baseballs they
fetch are also auctioned off, with the proceeds going to an animal
adoption agency in Redwood.</TE>
<TE>   It was a quiet day on McCovey Cove when Bonds had his two Splash
Hits. There were only five boats anchored to the muddy bottom,
including The Grapes of Mirth, captained by Bart O'Brien, who owns a
winery in Napa. On board was comedian and political humorist Will
Durst, a Giants' season-ticket holder, who wryly acknowledged that
history was being made--no other player has ever had two Splash Hits
in one game.</TE>
<TE>   "The same odds as George Bush completing a Mensa application," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson and his partner, Ron Mero, left before the game ended.
Kayak in tow, they had a 40-minute ride back across the Bay to
Alameda. They had seen enough, and besides, Bonds wasn't coming up
again.</TE>
<TE>   But if it's a sunny day and Bonds is on a hot streak, the place
will look like a parking lot again. Somebody better be ready to
