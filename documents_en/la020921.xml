<DH>Art* Oddball crew of performers take their acts to the
streets for annual gallery event.</DH>

<LD>It is a few minutes after 7 p.m., which would be curtain time for
"All Stars of Performance Art--Episode 8"--if there was a curtain. No
place to hang one when your stage is a yellow flatbed truck, borrowed
from the City of Los Angeles General Services Motor Pool. The truck
is parked across the street from Trinity Episcopal Church on a modest
residential street off Melrose, east of Normandie.</LD>
<LD>   The lack of a curtain would seem to take the pressure off to
adhere to a scheduled curtain time--but still, the host of the show
is getting worried. The performance artist known as the Dark Bob--a
friendly vampire type in a flowing cape, suit coat, tie, purple
velvet booties, tights and a glittering gold-on-black skirt--is
pacing Berendo Street. Nobody is here yet but the artists.</LD>
<LD>   His apprehension may explain the exceptionally warm greeting the
Dark Bob offers to the first arriving guest.</LD>
<TE>   "It's nice to have one person in the audience," he says, with an
overeager handshake.</TE>
<TE>   The Dark Bob begins to point out some of the evening's performers:
percussionist Prof. Danny Frankel and instrumentalist Pablo Calogera;
the garage rock art band Kittenfreaky; the Mudpeople, getting into
costume by busily smearing multicolored mud all over each other on a
sidewalk corner. They never took the stage; this was the performance.</TE>
<TE>   "This evening, the Mudpeople will be circulating among the crowd,"
the Dark Bob offers.</TE>
<TE>   "That would be me," observes the sole audience member, yours
truly.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," the Dark Bob replies ruefully. "That would be you."</TE>
<TE>   But by about 7:30, there is a crowd--or at least enough bodies to
fill most of the 16 metal folding chairs also borrowed from the city,
plus others standing on the sidewalk or perched on windowsills. The
Dark Bob--so named because he was the darker-haired member of the
former two-man performing team of Bob and Bob--took the stage.
"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, relief evident in his voice. "An
event is about to occur."</TE>
<TE>   The Thursday night show was the first of two "All Stars"
performances presented in conjunction with the 5th Annual Art Crawl,
in which 22 art galleries of Echo Park, Silver Lake and Los Feliz
open their doors for "two nights and a day" of art viewing. The crawl
ends today, with galleries open from 12 to 7 p.m.
(www.ceart.com/artcrawl).</TE>
<TE>   The performance art event took place in front of the newly opened
Ortobello Gallery, where the show's dreadlocked, tattooed audience,
sporting their thrift-shop fantasies, mixed with a handful of
pearl-wearing art collectors. Curious neighbors, children and a
cinnamon-colored dog observed the action from afar. Over near the
Mudpeople, a transaction of some type took place between a visitor
wielding a video camera and a group of locals bearing handfuls of
fruit.</TE>
<TE>   Under Thursday's almost full moon, Frankel and Calogera sent their
eccentric rhythms toward the clear sky; bespectacled monologuist
Simone Gad bared her quirky soul; two members of Kittenfreaky sang
and, for one number, invited the audience to join them in loud,
improvised monkey sounds. Several did, ooo-ooo-OOO. The male-female
singing duo Tyrants in Therapy upset the Dark Bob by belting songs
laced with profanity--flouting the taste guidelines laid down for the
outdoor, city-sponsored event.</TE>
<TE>   Lida Abdullah entered into a deeply personal ritual that involved
using plastic wrap to package herself together with a dollhouse, over
which she had poured ketchup and mayonnaise. During the performance,
she blew soap bubbles while moaning out a chant that seemed to deal
with unity: "one house, one moon, one sexuality, one, one, one...."</TE>
<TE>   Marcus Kuiland-Nazarios' performance involved installing himself
in the cab of the truck/stage, offering 10-minute private anger
counseling to audience members. This evening's "clients" included
well-known performance artist John Fleck; Keith Antar Mason, artistic
director of the Venice-based African American performance ensemble
Hittite Empire, and Mount Washington artist Josie Koth, who said she
felt much better after the experience.</TE>
<TE>   Kuiland-Nazarios felt better, too--that is, until he stepped out
of the truck to witness Abdullah's moans and bubbles. "Now that makes
me angry," he said.</TE>

<HD>Burns Returns to Tell His Story</HD>
<DH>Television* PBS gathers up the producer's complete
documentary career, including 'Civil War,' and creates 'American
Stories' series.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Several years ago Ken Burns asked PBS to put an embargo on re-airing
his award-winning 1990 documentary, "The Civil War."</LD>
<LD>   "It seemed to me for the first seven or eight years after the
original broadcast, it was ubiquitous on the system," Burns says
during a recent visit to Los Angeles. "It was like the British
Empire. There wasn't a moment where the 'Civil War' wasn't some place
playing during pledge. The system agreed it was good to build up some
demand."</LD>
<LD>   Burns was hoping to do a big 10th anniversary airing of the
five-part, 11-hour documentary that gripped the nation when it first
aired, but he was too caught up in his latest historical documentary,
"Jazz."</LD>
<TE>   "So we said we couldn't juggle more than one documentary. So we
settled on an even dozen years."</TE>
<TE>   Beginning Sunday, PBS will rebroadcast "The Civil War," which has
been completely digitally remastered. Simultaneously this week,
Warner Home Video released the Emmy Award-winning series on DVD
($130).</TE>
<TE>   Then on Sept. 30, PBS will premiere "Ken Burns American Stories,"
a weekly series that will encompass his entire documentary career.</TE>
<TE>   Among the films included on the series are: "The Statue of
Liberty" (Sept. 30), the Oscar-nominated "Brooklyn Bridge" (Oct. 21);
"Thomas Jefferson" (Oct. 28, Nov. 4); "Mark Twain" (Nov. 18 to 25).
"Empire of the Air: The Men Who Made Radio" (Dec. 9) and "Huey Long"
(Dec. 30).</TE>
<TE>   Burns will supply introductions to each installment of "American
Stories." And just as with "The Civil War," all the documentaries
made before the digital age have been remastered.</TE>
<TE>   The weekly showcase came about due to the success of his
individual biographies on the public broadcast network, most
especially his poignant historical profile on Mark Twain that aired
earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   "PBS suggested that besides this big rebroadcast of 'The Civil
War,' we do this ongoing series of American stories," Burns says. "I
was really excited because some things like my 'Huey Long' had one
national broadcast. You look at the big competitors and their problem
is they don't have enough programming, so they'll take a movie and
churn it to death. You can see something on A&amp;E 20 times in a month.
But on PBS, you can have a Peabody Award-winning documentary on Frank
Lloyd Wright, and it is shown once. So here is a coordinated way to
show these documentaries."</TE>
<TE>   "The Civil War" and his other historical documentaries are even
timelier after the events of the Sept. 11 attacks, Burns says.</TE>
<TE>   "Remember when the 'Civil War' was happening Johnny Carson talked
about it in his monologue every night that week? It had a huge, broad
cultural connection. It became a nexus around which people could talk
about America. In the wake of what has happened to us, the notion
that we can go ahead blindly without any connection to the past is
really a fool's errand. I think there is something these films offer
in the sense that if you don't know where you've been, you don't know
where you are going."</TE>
<TE>   Burns is thrilled that he has been able to "fix" the "Civil War."
He admits he was never really satisfied with the picture quality when
it initially aired and when it was subsequently released on video.</TE>
<TE>   "We went frame by frame and digitalized everything," he says.</TE>
<TE>   He also upgraded the soundtrack from monaural to stereophonic "so
Pickett's Charge cascades over you."</TE>
<TE>   Although he makes historical documentaries, Burns has never
reflected upon his past films until "American Stories."</TE>
<TE>   "This has been an interesting time," Burns reflects. "This has
turned into a kind of retrospective. At first I thought, 'oh good,
this is a new way to show the stuff that hasn't been seen in years.'</TE>
<TE>   "But all of a sudden, people are saying to me, 'You have been
making historical documentaries for 25 years--let's stop and look at
this amazing collection of things you have done and the way it has
reordered the way documentaries are made and the way in which they
have had an effect on culture.' "</TE>
<TE>   Burns has found returning to his old films to be a personal
journey for him. "You go back and you look at them, and they are
pretty accurate snapshots of where I was," Burns says. "I don't feel
the compulsion Hollywood directors do to fiddle and change things.
This is who I was. I am so lucky that at each juncture I gave every
film my all."</TE>
<TE>   Several documentary filmmakers have attempted to emulate Burns'
style of using vintage photographs, live cinematography, music,
narration and first-person voices. Perhaps the most successful is
Burns' brother Ric ("New York"), who was co-producer of "The Civil
War."</TE>
<TE>   "But he is a different sort of filmmaker," Ken Burns says. "He is
much more intellectual, less emotional than I am. He has plumbed
darker depths than I have. I have been unafraid of dealing with
controversy, but I also look for a kind of mitigating positive force.
He doesn't need that kind of thing."</TE>
<TE>   Burns is currently working on several documentaries, including
"Horatio's Drive," set to premiere sometime in 2003. The film will
deal with the first cross-country car trip in 1903--sort of a real
life "Great Race" and "Around the World in 80 Days," in which
31-year-old doctor Horatio Nelson Jackson bet he could drive across
America in under 90 days. Tom Hanks is supplying the voice of
Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   "He took a lot of still photographs along the way and we found an
old 1903 Winton, the car he drove," Burns said. "We retraced the
route. We collected pictures from the towns he went through and have
the first-person voices of the newspaper reporters."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The Civil War" can be seen Sunday through Friday at 8 p.m. on
KCET; "Ken Burns American Stories" begins Sept. 30 at 9 p.m. on KCET
with "The Statue of Liberty."</TE>

<HD>Two More New York Bands Are Rockin' L.A.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NATALIE NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sick of hearing about all the New York City "buzz bands" who are
gonna save rock 'n' roll? Well, too bad, because two more made a
splash in local clubs this week.</LD>
<LD>   Although the dark pleasures of Interpol and the more immediate
thrills of the Mooney Suzuki didn't intersect much, each did its part
to help absolve pop's recent sins, drawing from storied underground
traditions to deliver music for the here and now.</LD>
<LD>   Hearing these two groups wouldn't pinpoint any New York "sound,"
but their differences evoked the variety in NYC's last vibrant era,
the late '70s. Performing on Wednesday at the Troubadour, Interpol
showed roots in British punk and post-punk, while the Mooney Suzuki's
Roxy set on Thursday cleaved to the MC5's Detroit rock anarchy.</LD>
<TE>   Interpol demonstrated why it's often compared to Joy Division.
Singer-guitarist Paul Banks' vocals do recall the late Ian Curtis'
hollowed-out warble, but the introverted melodies and inventive
rhythms of songs from the group's debut album, "Turn on the Bright
Lights," also evoked Wire's kinetic angularity, Echo and the
Bunnymen's haunted torchiness and the Pixies' visceral imagery.</TE>
<TE>   The more extroverted Mooney Suzuki charged through selections from
its current album, "Electric Sweat," and more with ferocious abandon.
Incorporating flavors of the Who and early Stones, the black-clad
quartet shaped its influences less originally than Interpol did. Yet
it was more fun to watch, firing up the packed house with crazy stage
antics while exhorting the crowd to clap rhythms and sing refrains.</TE>
<TE>   Such driving numbers as "In a Young Man's Mind" celebrated the
moment with an exciting clash of guitars and beats that felt
dangerous and sexy like the MC5, although the messages rarely had a
fight-the-power point. One can perhaps argue that this group's
priorities aren't entirely straight, considering its appearance in a
Nike commercial covering Cole Porter's "Don't Fence Me In,"
punked-out almost beyond recognition on Thursday. Yet it played with
such conviction the music screamed "Revolution!"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Mooney Suzuki, with the BellRays, others, plays Wednesday at
the Roxy, 9009 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood, 8 p.m. $10. (310)
278-9457.</TE>

<HD>The Songs Are Still De-Lovely in 'Anything Goes'</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When mounting "Anything Goes," ignore the title sentiment.</LD>
<LD>   The show is primarily a string of mediocre gags and great songs. A
revival should maintain professional standards in both the comedy and
the music.</LD>
<LD>   For the Reprise! version of the 1934 chestnut, at Freud Playhouse,
director Glenn Casale and musical director Gerald Sternbach keep the
standard high.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, the Reprise! method of putting the band on stage and
using a stripped-down set may be the best way to handle a show with
such a flimsy plot and cardboard characters. The point is to put the
gags and the songs and the satire of celebrity worship up front,
presented straight to the audience without scenic distractions,
almost as if we're back in vaudeville. If the shipboard shenanigans
involving cross-class romances and mistaken identities make no sense,
it doesn't matter.</TE>
<TE>   Rachel York plays nightclub impresario Reno Sweeney with sparkly
sophistication. She has a big voice, but it isn't a Mermanesque buzz
saw; she treats the songs with a degree of subtlety.</TE>
<TE>   She's decked out handsomely by costume designers Steven Howard and
Bob Miller--first, in a slinky beige evening gown, but more memorably
in a bright red-and-white shipboard ensemble that picks up on her red
lipstick and white teeth as she opens her mouth to sing.</TE>
<TE>   Brent Barrett looks like an Arrow Shirt model as Billy Crocker,
the story's stockbroker/stowaway. His voice suggests the era's
crooners, yet he also manages to unveil a lower range with some heft.</TE>
<TE>   Billy's romantic preference for the ingenue Hope Harcourt over the
effervescent Reno is unfathomable. Nonetheless, Hope's rather
lackluster qualities do not reflect on Anastasia Barzee, who plays
her with a lustrous sound and a good-sport quality.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Graae leads the comic pack as Moonface Martin, a gangster
who is more often scared than scary. Anyone who has seen Graae's work
knows that he could sleepwalk his way through this role and still get
laughs. Fortunately, he's wide awake and provides much of the
production's pulse.</TE>
<TE>   DeLee Lively, whose name sounds as if it could be a lyric from the
show's song "It's De-Lovely," is big and brassy as Moonface's moll
with a heart of cheese. Larry Cedar is light and reedy as the wealthy
Brit who takes such joy in learning American slang that you can
almost see why Reno turns her attentions to him.</TE>
<TE>   Sally Struthers gets laughs as Hope's mercenary high-society mom.
She's doing a part that once might have been played by Jean
Stapleton, her "All in the Family" mom. Fred Willard is on hand too,
doing a shtick as Billy's tipsy boss.</TE>
<TE>   Choreographer Dan Mojica's troops, especially Austin Miller as the
ship's purser, have a few moments to shine, despite limited space,
and do their part to keep our mind off the plot. This is the 1987
version of the original book, adapted by Timothy Crouse and John
Weidman, but much of the patter is still lame. And the story is
saddled with a wince-worthy subplot about two Chinese immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Cole Porter's score is the show's redeeming glory, and musical
director Sternbach treats it with care.</TE>
<TE>   This is the first Reprise! show since the death of the group's
original musical director, Peter Matz, who was more of a genial
audience presence than most of his peers because of his placement on
stage and his occasional interventions into the action.</TE>
<TE>   Matz is honored with a program page and with a paragraph in a note
by producing artistic director Marcia Seligson. He isn't mentioned
from the stage, however. Instead, the cast does an encore rendition
of Porter's "Take Me Back to Manhattan," as yet another tribute to
the spirit of New Yorkers.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The goofy variety show "All That," Nickelodeon's version of "Saturday
Night Live" for the 16-and-younger set, opens its fall season at 8
tonight with the kid sister of one of pop's biggest stars joining the
cast.</LD>
<LD>   Eleven-year-old Jamie Spears, who appeared with sibling Britney in
the recent theatrical release "Crossroads" as well as big sis' HBO
special, checks in as the eighth and youngest member of the talented
ensemble cast. And judging from the response of the studio audience,
who greeted her every twitch and turn with screams and applause,
she's already a favorite.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, every skit in "All That" gets a big response, if not
from the hyped-up crowd, then from the sweetening of an
industrial-strength laugh track. The idea is to generate an
atmosphere of frantic, fast-paced fun, yet the half-dozen skits and
blackouts jammed around a song from the weekly musical act (boy group
B2K tonight) are usually strong enough to carry the half hour on
their own.</LD>
<TE>   As might be expected, Jamie figures prominently in just about
every bit tonight, and one wonders how the arrival of this
pre-pubescent upstart will sit with the show's reigning glamour
queen, Chelsea Brummet, 16. (While the rest of the cast members are
running amok and mugging over the closing credits, Jamie and Chelsea
appear to be the only ones coolly dancing to the music.)</TE>
<TE>   Like "SNL," graduates from the "All That" franchise, now in its
eighth season, have already been making a name for themselves, most
notably Amanda Byrnes (currently in the WB's "What I Like About You"
and opposite Frankie Muniz in the movie "Big Fat Liar") and Nick
Cannon (in the upcoming films "Drumline" and the remake of "Can't Buy
Me Love").</TE>
<TE>   Don't be surprised if the class of 2002 has some breakout
performers of its own.</TE>

<HD>'Sobibor' Refutes Perception No One Resisted Holocaust</HD>
<DH>Film* French director Claude Lanzmann shows courage of
prisoners in Nazi camp uprising.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM TUGEND</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Sobibor, October 14, 1943, 4 p.m." is a documentary by French
director Claude Lanzmann, whose title pinpoints the exact date and
time for the start of the only successful uprising and escape by Jews
at any Nazi extermination camp during the Holocaust.</LD>
<LD>   Countering the widespread perception that 6 million European Jews
went unresisting to their deaths, the Sobibor uprising, together with
the Warsaw Ghetto revolt six months earlier, showed what Jews could
and would do if they were aware that they were marked for extinction
and had a handful of weapons.</LD>
<LD>   Compared with two other Lanzmann documentaries, the monumental 9
1/2-hour-long "Shoah," and "Tzahal," which runs five hours, "Sobibor"
is brief--only 95 minutes. But there is a psychological link between
"Sobibor" and "Tzahal" (the Hebrew acronym for the Israel Defense
Forces), which focused on soldiers of the Jewish state, according to
the director.</LD>
<TE>   Just as the SS men at Sobibor were caught off guard by the
uprising because they simply could not imagine that the terrorized
Jews would ever strike back, so the world was astonished in 1948 by
the fighting spirit and skill of Israeli soldiers facing the armies
of five Arab states.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, there is a clear connection," says the 76-year-old Lanzmann,
speaking by phone from his home in Paris. "I even dreamed of
beginning 'Tzahal' with the story of Sobibor, but it was technically
not possible."</TE>
<TE>   As in his other films, "Sobibor" applies Lanzmann's trademark
style of long, intensive, unhurried interviews with the actual
participants, and uses a minimum of explanatory footage.</TE>
<TE>   Here the sole protagonist is Yehuda Lerner, a man, in Lanzmann's
words, "of tireless and indomitable courage." First caught by the
Nazis in his native Warsaw when he was just 16, Lerner was sent to a
forced labor camp. He escaped and in the following six months managed
the incredible feat of seven more escapes. Each time, he was
recaptured and sent to a different camp but, miraculously, was not
executed out of hand.</TE>
<TE>   "If a man wants to live, nothing is too difficult for him," Lerner
observes in the film.</TE>
<TE>   Ending up in the Sobibor death camp in eastern Poland in early
September 1943, Lerner was fortunate enough to fall in with a small
group of Jewish combat veterans of the Soviet army. They had been
segregated from other Red Army prisoners of war and knew how to use
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   In an hourlong uprising, timed to the minute and relying on the
Germans' obsessive punctuality, Lerner and his fellows killed 12 of
the 16 SS officers and men on duty. About 365 prisoners escaped, but
most were killed by the camp's Ukrainian guards, in the surrounding
minefields, or recaptured and shot. Only 47 survived the war.</TE>
<TE>   Lerner, a retired police official who now lives in Jerusalem,
recounts his story in Hebrew. He was interviewed by Lanzmann in 1979,
during the 11-year-long preparation for "Shoah." In the end, both the
theme and length of Lerner's testimony could not be fitted into
"Shoah," but over the years Lanzmann decided that Lerner's story
deserved a separate film.</TE>
<TE>   For the new documentary, Lanzmann shot scenes of the fields of
Belarus, where Lerner was initially interned, and the now weed-choked
Sobibor railway station, but he retained the original 1979 interview.
In his lean, disciplined style, Lanzmann shuns dramatic and by now
familiar Holocaust footage of stacked corpses and starving prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   Given his rigorous standards, Lanzmann has little but disdain for
the continuing outpouring of feature films and docudramas on the Nazi
and Holocaust eras. Nor is Lanzmann taken by the vast accumulation of
testimonies by Holocaust survivors, which he deprecates as a formless
"inflation of memory."</TE>
<TE>   Despite these objections, Lanzmann is certain that writers and
filmmakers' fascination with the Holocaust will continue. "This was
the central event of the 20th century," he says. "The farther we move
away from it, the better we can measure its scope and magnitude. I
could not have made 'Shoah' or 'Sobibor' after only 20 years had
passed."</TE>
<TE>   Lanzmann feels the singularity of the Holocaust so deeply that he
is reluctant to even give it a name. He explains that he was the
first to use the term "Shoah," a biblical Hebrew word meaning
"catastrophe," because "I do not understand Hebrew and this was my
way of not naming it at all. If I could, I would have released the
film without a name, or called it 'The Thing.' "</TE>
<TE>   Lanzmann serves as publisher and editor of the influential Les
Temps Modernes magazine and is planning a fictional film that will
not touch on the Holocaust.</TE>
<TE>   The filmmaker declined a suggestion that he make a documentary
about his own role in World War II, when he fought with the French
partisans against the Nazi occupation force.</TE>
<TE>   "It would not be very dramatic," he protests. "I fought the
Germans with weapons, but many other people did the same."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Sobibor" will screen today and Sunday at 10 a.m. at the Laemmle
Sunset 5 in West Hollywood as part of the Laemmle Documentary Days
series. It will be shown on consecutive weekends at 11 a.m. at the
Monica 4 in Santa Monica, Playhouse 7 in Pasadena and Fallbrook in
West Hills.</TE>

<HD>Warren Sings Heroically in Last-Minute 'Girl' Change</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two cast changes--one scheduled, the other last-minute--illuminated
the penultimate performance of Puccini's "Girl of the Golden West" by
Los Angeles Opera at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion Thursday night.</LD>
<LD>   As planned, Luis Lima took over the role of Dick Johnson, which
had been sung by Placido Domingo at the opening shows of the run. The
veteran tenor from Argentina, not seen on the L.A. Opera stage since
a series of "Madame Butterflys" in 1996, returned to give a solid,
musically satisfying performance.</LD>
<LD>   The surprise change was announced by company spokesman Peter
Somogyi from the stage: Catherine Malfitano, suffering a viral
infection for several days, had decided, just one hour before the
7:30 curtain, that she was not well enough to go on. In her place,
her cover in the role of Minnie, American soprano Nina Warren, would
perform. Warren sang heroically.</LD>
<TE>   A musician from California trained at the Manhattan and Juilliard
schools in New York, Warren has extensive European credits and she
sang the alternate Turandot with L.A. Opera in June.</TE>
<TE>   Her voice is healthy, sizable and handsome; occasionally, her high
notes grow wild or strident, yet for the most part she delivered
consistent beauty of tone throughout this long and taxing part, which
demands ready resources of volume, lyricism and steel. And her acting
as the Bible-reading, gun-toting Minnie who loves the outlaw Johnson
proved credible and charming in every scene.</TE>
<TE>   The chemistry between Warren and Lima, and their vocal pairing,
proved serendipitous. At a boyish 54--an age Lima achieved a week
ago--the tenor still looks the handsome Puccini hero, who in this
case is also a dark and threatening outlaw. The voice carries on, and
Lima's honeyed tone and elegant charisma make his a memorable
Johnson. By the time he got to "Ch'ella mi creda" in the final
act--unlike Domingo, he sang it in the original key, by the way--Lima
seemed to tire, yet that fatigue served mostly as an emblem of the
outlaw's long road to redemption.</TE>
<TE>   In this act, as in the opening one, conductor Simone Young
occasionally let Puccini's full orchestra overpower the singers. Some
temptations are too great to resist.</TE>
<TE>   The opera has one more performance to go. Lima is scheduled to
sing Johnson; Malfitano promises to return as Minnie.</TE>

<HD>Donor Vilar Owes $500,000 to L.A. Opera for 'Lohengrin'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Friday, Los Angeles Opera joined a growing chorus of arts
organizations who are acknowledging that high-tech billionaire and
mega-donor Alberto W. Vilar--whose Amerindo Investments Inc. has
suffered deep stock losses in the past three years--is failing to
meet some of his major financial commitments to those organizations.</LD>
<LD>   L.A. Opera spokesman Gary Murphy confirmed that Vilar has not paid
the final $500,000 installment of the $1 million the donor and board
member had committed to last season's production of Wagner's
"Lohengrin." That payment was due several days ago, Murphy said.</LD>
<LD>   Murphy added that the opera has found another donor, the Forman
Family Fund, to underwrite its production of "Don Giovanni" later in
the season, for an undisclosed amount. Vilar was to underwrite that
production as part of an overall $10-million pledge to L.A. Opera to
fund new productions, as well as an education program for young
artists.</LD>
<TE>   L.A. Opera has already changed course once this season over a
money disagreement with Vilar. Several weeks ago, the company
canceled its $3-million production of Prokofiev's "War and Peace,"
scheduled for October, after Vilar refused to contribute additional
funds, as well as to adjust his payment schedule to pay upfront.
Opera officials, as well as Vilar, called that an amicable decision,
and Vilar, who was unavailable for comment Friday, remains on the
opera's board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   Vilar's company, Amerindo, has gone from managing $5.5 billion to
$1.1 billion since January 2000. Vilar also suffered major health
problems and surgeries in late 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The news from Los Angeles Opera comes after confirmations earlier
this week from the New York Philharmonic and Washington Opera that
Vilar has missed payments recently.</TE>
<TE>   New York Philharmonic music director Lorin Maazel said Vilar
failed to supply $700,000 of funds promised for next week's
Maazel-Vilar Conductors Competition at Carnegie Hall, forcing Maazel
to put up his own money and seek other funding sources. Vilar also
missed his most recent payment to Washington Opera for its
Vilar/Domingo Young Artist Program, prompting that company to remove
Vilar's name from the program.</TE>

<LD>Warren Zevon's acid wit, energetic performances and fearless
songwriting have made him a musical hero to me for 25 years. His
outlook, while looking death straight in the eye at close range, has
made him a personal hero to me as well ("Facing Mortality With
Mischief Rather Than Tears," by Geoff Boucher, Sept. 13).</LD>
<LD>   For a man who titled one of his albums "Mr. Bad Example," he's a
shining example for us all.</LD>

<TE>   The writer, the artist and the man will be greatly missed. His
body of work is the most literate in all of pop music, and
appreciation for it will most certainly--and deservedly--grow.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent CD is called "My Ride's Here," and I guess it is.
But I just want to issue a public thank you for the ride Zevon has
given me. It has sometimes been a bit rocky and treacherous, but
never dull.</TE>

<TE>   I can be so captivated by an elegant turn of phrase, and yet
Zevon's wry and succinct "But you know, imminent doom lowers the bar
a bit" rolls back the clock, reducing my own vocabulary to adolescent
babble. Rock on, Warren.</TE>

<LD>"U.S. Diplomacy Gets a Little Help From Artists" (Diane Haithman,
Sept. 13) belies the much greater problem, which is that artists get
no help from the government.</LD>
<LD>   While the U.S. Department of State's Art in Embassies Program is a
viable and worthwhile effort, the weak link in its chain is the
complete absence of funds for paying an honorarium to the artists
whose work is so honored. This gap reflects the notion that artists
have no need of financial support for their careers, and that
recognition is an adequate substitute for the monetary return that
every other hard-working professional in America expects for their
work.</LD>

<LD>   I am not looking forward to our cultural options post-Sept. 11.
I'm wondering if we are going to deprive ourselves of the rich music,
art and culture the Middle East has to offer in the name of "homeland
security." Music and art have an ability to bring cultures together.
Won't that help "homeland security"?</LD>

<LD>I enjoyed Robert Hilburn's article on the Sex Pistols ("He's Still

said that "it's only as Johnny Rotten that John Lydon matters in pop
culture."</LD>
<LD>   I went to a lot of PiL shows in the early '80s and I think Lydon
had a lot going on there as well. PiL played a pretty significant
role in post Punk, and I thought for sure Hilburn would have
recognized that.</LD>

<LD>In launching its own version of "I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of

version of Darwin's theory.</LD>
<LD>   If they were to put out in the wild such useless celebrities as
Michael Jackson, the dweeb from those Dell commercials and, just for
the heck of it, Don King, a "reality" show would actually be serving
some social purpose. Wow, what a concept.</LD>

<LD>I have read in numerous magazines and papers about the success of "My

more than 30 women who have seen or want to see the movie and the
reason: Aiden.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, John Corbett, a.k.a. Aiden from "Sex in the City." Funny how
in all the articles this wonderful actor has not gotten any credit
for the near "cult" following I am sure he has. He was perfectly cast
in this role.</LD>

<LD>I really enjoyed Brian Lowry's Sept. 18 column, "All That Viewers Ask
for Is a Little Closure," and I couldn't agree more.</LD>
<LD>   The worst case of this policy that I have ever seen was concerning
"The Fugitive 2000" on CBS.</LD>
<LD>   The producers spent the entire season building up a complicated
story line with several conspiracy theories.</LD>
<TE>   When the series was not picked up, the powers that be decided it
didn't matter if there was a conclusion. It would be like showing the
first 23 hours of "24," then pulling the plug.</TE>
<TE>   Now, I know that "The Fugitive 2000" did not bring in giant
ratings, but as one of the 5 million or so people who watched every
week, it felt like a slap in the face. If this is the regard that the
networks have for the viewer, it's no wonder that they are losing
ratings every year.</TE>

<TE>   I'm a "Now and Again" fan and really miss it. It was the only
weekly program that I tuned in for, and the whole deal with that show
was the potential for closure in a lightly comic yet deeply emotional
way. They really left us hanging.</TE>

<TE>   After much fanfare over the Sci Fi Channel's "Farscape" being
renewed for two seasons, we have been told that the show will end
after the fourth season ... with a cliffhanger! The decision was made
too late to make the changes necessary to wind up the show properly.</TE>
<TE>   I do not mind open-ended stories, when they are intentionally so,
and when they are well executed. But this capricious act is not only
inconsiderate, it is a gross insult to the viewers, who had been
promised another season and a proper finale.</TE>

<LD>   'Survivor' Still Strong Fifth Time Around</LD>
<LD>   Reflecting the durability of the franchise, the fifth edition of
CBS' "Survivor" premiered to 23 million viewers on Thursday night,
Nielsen Media Research reported Friday. Tune-in for "Survivor:
Thailand" was comparable to last season's debuts of the third and
fourth installments, and this year's version scored better in the
all-important younger demographic.</LD>
<TE>   "Survivor" also helped lift "Big Brother 3" to its largest
audience of the summer, with 14.6 million viewers. The show
overshadowed ABC's new interactive drama "Push, Nevada," which drew a
mere 8.1 million viewers--losing roughly one-third of the audience
that sampled it in a Tuesday preview and again slipping in the second
half-hour.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood Lagging Behind in War Effort?</TE>
<TE>   So much for Hollywood's offensive in President Bush's war on
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   A government commission says the entertainment industry isn't
doing enough to promote the nation internationally.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy, which advises
the White House and the State Department, has met with Jack Valenti,
head of the Motion Picture Assn. of America, to discuss the perceived
ineffectiveness of public-service announcements that try to
communicate shared values and cultural commonality. There have been
problems in distribution, committee chairman Harold Pachios said,
and, besides, "a 2-minute ad is not something that means a lot."</TE>
<TE>   It's unrealistic to expect ads such as one directed by Tony and
Ridley Scott (released by the Entertainment Industry Foundation last
week) to sway Muslim opinion, the committee said. Better to make
documentaries explaining American life and culture and the reasons
behind U.S. policymaking, as Hollywood did during World War II and in
the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   An MPAA spokesman said the industry's first priority has been to
bolster the morale of American troops in harm's way by sending them
top Hollywood films.</TE>
<TE>   Carson's Emphysema Not Disabling, He Says</TE>
<TE>   Responding to tabloid reports that he is incapacitated by
emphysema, Johnny Carson wants to reassure folks that he's fine.</TE>
<TE>   Carson confirmed, through Carson Productions spokesman Jeff
Sotzing, that he is suffering from the disease. But the retired king
of late-night TV, 76, is still playing tennis and cruising in his
custom-built triple-deck, 130-foot boat when he's not on his Point
Dume bluffside estate.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm dealing with it the best I can, and it is not causing me any
major problems," Carson said.</TE>
<TE>   Many cases of emphysema, which causes shortness of breath, are
attributed to smoking--a habit of Carson's, TV viewers will recall.</TE>
<TE>   Though the disease cannot be cured, its progression can be halted
if caught in its early stages.</TE>

<HD>She's Richard III, Hear Her Roar</HD>
<DH>Jacqueline Wright leads a nontraditional and remarkable
cast in a Bard update</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID C. NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The perilous times afoot render William Shakespeare's "Richard III"
more urgently topical than ever. Appropriately, adapter-director
Chris Kelley's Theatre of NOTE production favors contemporary
insight, embodied by a remarkable ensemble spearheaded by Jacqueline
Wright's award-worthy title villain.</LD>
<LD>   Kelley refreshes the Bard's study of corrupted ambition by
examining isolation's effect on the pathological persona. The reading
submerges iambic pentameter in tempos ranging from dryly
conversational to thunderously declamatory.</LD>
<LD>   Amplifying this is the intimate arena configuration, with the
audience surrounding Manriki Guzari's stark playing field. Robert
Oriol's sound and lighting create eerie chiaroscuro, and Miguel
Montalvo's superb monochromatic costumes combine an array of historic
silhouettes with modern wit, as in court reporters suitable for the
Daily Planet.</LD>
<TE>   Wright, her mercurial articulation traversing the entire sardonic
scale, is a revelation, so invested that the gender switch is a
nonissue. This comet ignites Rosemary Lotus Boyce's rueful Anne,
Judith Ann Levitt's incantatory Margaret, Katherine Gibson's
wrenching Elizabeth and Elizabeth Liang's steely Duchess of York.</TE>
<TE>   Other indelible pawns include Christopher Neiman's Clarence, who
recalls the late John Cazale; Stewart Skelton's reedy Buckingham; and
Montalvo's giddy Hastings; and the assassins of David Reynolds and
Ezra Buzzington, but, really, everyone excels.</TE>
<TE>   Their triumphant commitment provides recompense for the sole
liability: fluctuating visibility. I heard "now is the winter of our
discontent" without seeing Wright's delivery and, changing sides
after intermission, found "my kingdom for a horse" obscured. Nothing
quells the production's electrifying trajectory, though, not even
sporadic charges of radio drama.</TE>

<HD>Watching Art Watchers Is an Art in Itself</HD>
<DH>German photographer Thomas Struth's often-spectacular
works --of people looking at pictures--pull in viewers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PAGEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you think going to a museum to look at pictures of people looking
at pictures is redundant, you'll probably be put off by Thomas
Struth's exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art, which opened
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   But that would be your loss. Struth's photographs invite viewers
to contemplate peculiar details, rewarding us with intriguing
pleasures.</LD>
<LD>   The 48-year-old German artist's midcareer survey, which was
organized by the Dallas Museum of Art, consists of 93 photographs.
They come in three sizes: huge color prints affixed to the backs of
gigantic sheets of Plexiglas and set in steely gray frames;
medium-size color pictures mounted similarly; and small
black-and-white photographs framed traditionally.</LD>
<TE>   At MOCA, the user-friendly exhibition fills three galleries. The
first contains nine big color prints Struth made between 1988 and
1992, when he visited museums in London, Paris, Vienna, Rome, Naples,
Venice and Chicago. They form the show's overture, introducing
viewers to major themes and providing a model of how its pictures
work.</TE>
<TE>   The first one is a straight-on shot of three early Renaissance
paintings in London's National Gallery. Titled "National Gallery,
London," Struth's photograph does not identify the paintings it
depicts.</TE>
<TE>   Everything that happens in his meticulously composed image also
takes place outside its frame, right where you're standing. In the
photograph, five ordinary viewers are oblivious to Struth's camera:
Their backs to the photographer, they face the same direction we do,
toward an elaborately framed, nearly life-size painting of the
Apostle Thomas examining the wound in Christ's side. The other
disciples' faces register a wide range of emotions, from
I-told-you-so sanctimony to relief that someone else had the nerve to
do what they were afraid to.</TE>
<TE>   Struth's choice of subject matter is instructive. Although
religious belief is not as pervasive as it was when the painting was
made, doubt is--especially doubt about art. And yet art's powers are
believed in by many, even if they can't be articulated clearly.</TE>
<TE>   The see-for-yourself, science-inspired skepticism embodied by
Thomas runs throughout Struth's oeuvre. It's palpable in his best
pictures, which seem to be unsure about their relationship to the
real world and uncertain about photography's capacity to capture
what's important about the present. Their doubt is infectious, even
quietly exciting, especially when it heightens one's perception of
the mysteriousness of simple things.</TE>
<TE>   The painting's composition is also significant. It provides the
architecture around which Struth builds his image. On the blank back
wall of the symmetrical room in which Christ and the Apostles stand,
a pair of arched windows open onto a fanciful landscape. This
illusionistic deep space functions as a pictorial counterweight to
the space in which viewers actually stand.</TE>
<TE>   Moving from the painted landscape to the painted room and on to
the photographed gallery, your eye picks up enough momentum to jump
from the two-dimensional realm of art to the 3-D space of real life.
By setting pictures within pictures and worlds within worlds, Struth
plays a sort of visual shell game, shuffling their frames so adeptly
that you feel as if you're included in the drama.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining eight photographs in the introductory gallery
present variations on this theme. Moments of serenity take shape amid
chaos, both within the paintings and amid the people looking at them.</TE>
<TE>   To make these images, Struth patiently waited until unsuspecting
museum visitors mirrored the postures of the painted figures or
mimicked their activities, either metaphorically or literally. The
idea that photography is a reproductive art takes a funny turn in his
work. Treating both painterly and photographic representations as
engines that set your imagination in motion, his pictures drive
viewers to determine just where they stand in relation to what they
see.</TE>
<TE>   The second gallery takes us into the street and back in time.
Small black-and-white photographs, most of which were made between
1977 and 1988, depict empty city streets in New York, Chicago, Paris,
Rome and Tokyo. Made just after daybreak, when most people are
sleeping, they transform the most banal, often ugly urban scenes into
delicious little interludes from the cacophony of life in the big
city.</TE>
<TE>   Although silence and solitude are these works' main ingredients,
Struth shows his sense of humor in "Piazza Augusto" (1984), in which
a huge stone statue of a bishop appears to beseech the heavens on
behalf of a pair of street-cleaner's pushcarts.</TE>
<TE>   In another, Struth acts like a movie director, which deadens the
effect of his otherwise engaging works. A big color print from 2001
depicts a gallery in Berlin's Pergamon Museum. More than 40 visitors
mill around the antiquities. But the serendipitous magic that Struth
captures in his other interiors is absent from this one, whose
viewers appear to be models hired for the shoot. They lack the
inimitable diversity of randomly gathered crowds and appear, instead,
to be a well-heeled class of fashionably dressed art students.</TE>
<TE>   Standing around and looking as if you're looking at art is nothing
like actually doing it. If Struth expects viewers to patiently study
his works, he should have the patience to wait for undirected groups
to spontaneously arrange themselves in compositions that interest
him.</TE>
<TE>   The largest gallery consists of seven room-size spaces arranged in
a counterclockwise spiral. The first room displays six family
portraits, and the final one--at the center of all the
others--features six views of lush forests, all titled "Paradise." To
follow the path set up by the sensitively laid-out installation is to
find yourself more and more alone with your thoughts--hell for people
addicted to the distraction of rapid-fire visual stimulation but
exquisite for the rest of us.</TE>
<TE>   Struth's portraits of families bring as many as 14 relatives
together, often packing them on overburdened furniture or in the
corner of small kitchens. Despite their cramped quarters, and facial
features that rhyme with one another, each sitter appears to inhabit
his own world. Struth achieves this effect by using a slow shutter
speed. The people who sit stillest come out the clearest; those who
move the most are the blurriest. The longer you look, the more
attuned you become to these subtleties. When you focus on an
individual, you feel as if all his or her relatives are staring at
you. Distance and intimacy intermingle.</TE>
<TE>   The next rooms take you to a cathedral in Milan, a parking lot in
Dallas, a harbor in China, a casino in Las Vegas, a subway station in
Tokyo, a meadow in Bavaria and a national park in California. Even
the pictures that include scores of people invite a type of romantic
reverie that makes them feel as if they were made for you alone.</TE>
<TE>   Of course that's an illusion, but Struth's uncanny photographs
allow you to entertain it longer--and more intensely--than usual. His
resplendent images of forests, shot in Australia, Japan, China,
Germany and Brazil between 1998 and 2001, are dazzlingly sensuous
feasts of color, texture and light, each leaf or frond a tiny
testament to the beauty of mundane details.</TE>
<TE>   Strange as it may seem, Struth is a realist whose true love is
daydreaming. The escapism that takes shape in his clear-eyed pictures
is not the programmed kind found on group tours or packaged and
delivered by mass entertainments. Charming and almost quaint in their
emphasis on individual experience, his often-spectacular photographs
redeem the ordinary world by emphasizing its richness.</TE>

<HD>Soulful Cityscape</HD>
<DH>The tempestuous Lorin Maazel takes the podium in New York,
conducting the premiere of John Adams' affecting 'On the
Transmigration of Souls,' in memory of Sept. 11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK--It is traditional, to say nothing of civil, to grant the
new music director of an orchestra a honeymoon or, at the very least,
the benefit of the doubt. But not in New York. Being America's most
arts-friendly city doesn't necessarily make it the most
artist-friendly one.</LD>
<LD>   Still, Lorin Maazel, who has more than his share of enemies among
the local press and within the music world, hardly seemed daunted
Thursday night at Avery Fisher Hall, as he began his first season as
music director of the New York Philharmonic.</LD>
<LD>   The notoriously finicky orchestra played brilliantly for him. The
notoriously finicky subscription audience cheered him loudly for his
flashy performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, even though (or
maybe because) it was just about the opposite of the kind of
Beethoven they were used to from Maazel's somber and respected German
predecessor, Kurt Masur.</LD>
<TE>   And Maazel made sure that the evening meant something both timely
and lasting, opening it with the premiere of John Adams' "On the
Transmigration of Souls," the most high-profile art work
commemorating Sept. 11. Written for orchestra, adult and children's
chorus and city sounds that evoke Lower Manhattan, this commission by
the New York Philharmonic and Lincoln Center Great Performers series
seemed destined to feel exploitative of New Yorkers' fixation with
the tragedy. Instead, it gave us something of wonder, mystery and
beauty to contemplate.</TE>
<TE>   But don't think for a minute all that will be enough. Maazel's
music directorship is certain to be tempestuous.</TE>
<TE>   On paper, Maazel appears to be the ideal leader for America's
oldest orchestra, the orchestra of Mahler, Toscanini, Mengelberg,
Stokowski, Walter, Bernstein and Boulez, to name some of the
outstanding principal conductors over its 160-year history. An
American, Maazel first conducted the New York Philharmonic in 1942 as
a boy of 12 (astonishingly, he made his Los Angeles Philharmonic
debut five years earlier, in short pants, at the Hollywood Bowl). He
has held prestigious posts in Berlin, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Vienna
and Munich. His conducting technique is legendary. He is a virtuoso
violinist. He is an active composer of symphonies and concertos and
is currently writing an opera based upon Orwell's "1984."</TE>
<TE>   Yet he was far from an obvious candidate. Although he has
conducted the New York Philharmonic more than 100 times throughout
his long career, he hasn't been on this podium often in recent
years--because his fees are so high. Maazel pioneered the
million-dollar, then the multimillion-dollar conductor contracts that
are now breaking orchestral bank accounts. He was perceived, at 72,
as too old and too out of touch. He is disliked personally by some
who find him arrogant and he is disliked musically by those who find
his interpretations persnickety.</TE>
<TE>   Say what you will about Maazel, he did the right thing by "On the
Transmigration of Souls," leading it with a gratifying combination of
competence and seriousness. Although even here, he and the
Philharmonic came under criticism for not including the work on its
televised gala concert Wednesday night, substituting Beethoven's
"Leonora" Overture No. 3.</TE>
<TE>   The musical starting point for Adams' 25-minute score was clearly
Charles Ives' "The Unanswered Question," with soft, uncertain open
string chords and a trumpet solo played off stage, from the lobby
behind the audience. But first the audience hears the noise--soft and
curiously comforting--of traffic, footsteps and sirens from
loudspeakers surrounding the auditorium. By letting in the very
street sounds concert halls are built to keep out, "Transmigration"
begins with an evocation of the dreamlike state that great tragedy
seems to generate.</TE>
<TE>   The texture of "Transmigration" is very complex, what with the
electronic cityscape--which also includes voices reading a litany of
randomly selected victims' names--the luminous orchestral colors and
the adult and children's choruses singing fragments of the
spontaneous messages to loved ones. But the effect is an immediate,
enveloping sonic tapestry.</TE>
<TE>   Adams' music, however quiet on the surface, has an inner pulse,
and that underlying teeming sensation has never been stronger or more
gratifying than it is here. Ultimately those pulses overpower all
else, as the choruses sings, "I know just where he is." Welled-up
emotion has no place to go but to explode, resolving with
overpowering effect as the adult chorus pulses on the word "light,"
while the children stutter the word "love." The return to serenity is
otherworldly, three solo violins playing a rising line in tremolo
quarter tones against the still mellow colors of winds and
percussion.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Philharmonic, the outstanding New York Choral Artists
and the wonderful Brooklyn Youth Chorus presented all this with great
care and concern. The stage was darkened, Maazel conducting in
silhouette, with only over-bright, over-emphatic projections of the
text to diminish the effect. The sound design by Mark Grey was
another glory of the experience. To this writer's taste, Adams' only
miscalculation was the litany of names, which verged on the maudlin.</TE>
<TE>   Beethoven's Ninth, which begins with tremolo strings in its own
mysterious meditation of the cosmos, sounded as though it picked up
just where Adams left off Thursday, leading to the famous ode to
brotherhood an hour later. Maazel's interpretation revealed why
people like him and why they dislike him. Especially impressive was
the clarity of the first movement, where a level of detail allowed
one to hear absolutely everything that was going on in the music.</TE>
<TE>   But there was also Maazel's slickness to contend with, giving the
impression of calculated ostentation. The symphony proceeded with
dizzying taffy pulls on the notes and startling eruptions of timpani.
By the Finale, when a listener might have thought he had had enough,
Maazel propelled things along with such a thrilling sweep that it
felt useless to resist. The soloists were very fine, and they
included Marina Mescheriakova, Jill Grove, Michael Schade and Rene
Pape. Once again, the New York Choral Artists was the terrific
chorus. All the singers were pushed to their considerable limits, and
that, too, was thrilling.</TE>
<TE>   Maazel's contract runs four years. There is not likely to be a
dull, or uncontroversial, moment.</TE>

<HD>A Musician Writes It, A Rapper Borrows It: A Swap or a
Theft?</HD>
<DH>Music* Notes written by a jazz musician and then used
repeatedly by the Beastie Boys on an album are at the center of a
debate on artistic freedom.</DH>

<LD>If You Can Feel What I'm Feeling</LD>
<LD>   Then It's a Musical Masterpiece</LD>
<LD>   But If You Can Hear What I'm Dealing With</LD>
<TE>   Then That's Cool at Least</TE>
<TE>   --"Pass the Mic" by the Beastie Boys</TE>
<TE>   The embittered jazz musician calls it rhymin' and stealing. The
shocked rappers argue that it's about a minor player manufacturing a
musical controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, James W. Newton Jr. vs. the Beastie Boys is the latest
example of hip-hop artists getting grief from musicians who view rap
song collages as artistic shoplifting.</TE>
<TE>   The heart of the matter is the Beastie Boys' song "Pass the Mic,"
which has a willowy, elongated flute sound rising above its cluster
of rock instruments, breakbeats and turntable scratches. The exotic
sounding tidbit, looped more than 40 times during the Beastie's
track, is a six-second, three-note performance that the Beastie Boys
clipped out of a 1982 recording called "Choir," a song written and
performed by Newton, a professor at Cal State L.A. and former
Guggenheim fellow.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years after Newton released "Choir," the Beastie Boys released
"Pass the Mic" on their acclaimed hit album "Check Your Head."
Another eight years would pass, however, until Newton became aware
that his impressive jazz resume now included a collaboration with the
clownish but creative New York trio.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt violated," Newton recalled this week. Newton found out
when one of his jazz ensemble students casually mentioned that he had
noticed Newton's name on the Beastie Boys album. Newton was skeptical
until the student brought the CD to class. Then he was livid.</TE>
<TE>   Samples of music, of course, are a hip-hop staple, and the Beastie
Boys have always sprinkled their compositions with prerecorded music
both famous (Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, etc.) and ridiculously
obscure. Like other major hip-hop artists, though, the Beasties spend
a considerable amount of time and money securing clearances for the
music they sample.</TE>
<TE>   So why was Newton upset, unaware and eager to sue? The answer
involves the nuances of U.S. copyrights on composition and recorded
performance as well as the fundamental importance of leaving a
forwarding mailing address.</TE>
<TE>   Newton's record label, ECM Records, tried to reach Newton in 1992
when the Beasties called to seek clearance on "Choir," but the
musician had moved. Newton's contract with the label gave the company
the authority to license out the recording and, a short time later, a
check for $500 was mailed by ECM to Newton but came back as
undeliverable.</TE>
<TE>   Newton remained oblivious while the Beasties assumed they had
taken care of the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Newton and his attorney, however, argue that the Beastie Boys only
did half the job. The group secured the sample as a recorded
performance but they did not secure clearance for it as a
composition. In basic terms, the performance clearance is for a
musician's work, while the composition clearance is for the handiwork
of the songwriter.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of "Choir," the performer and composer is Newton, and
via the copyright infringement lawsuit he filed in 2000 he claimed
the Beastie's did not give him his due.</TE>
<TE>   Proper Clearance</TE>
<TE>   The Beastie Boys disagreed--they said the snippet was far too
short and too simple to be regarded as a protectable piece of musical
work. "We cleared the recording but did not clear the composition
because what we used is three notes and three notes do not constitute
a composition," Adam Yauch of the Beastie Boys said this week. "If
one could copyright the basic building blocks of music or grammar
then there would be no room for making new compositions or books."</TE>
<TE>   In May, U.S. District Court Judge Nora M. Manella agreed with the
hip-hop stars and said the performance clearance secured by the
Beastie Boys was appropriate for a shard of music that was
"unoriginal as a matter of law."</TE>
<TE>   Newton's attorney, Alan Korn, is readying an appeal now. He says
Manella's decision is a chilling one for avant garde jazz,
electronica and other genres where traditional notation and song
structure do not lend themselves to easy analysis and charting in a
courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   A legal defense fund has been set up for Newton, who is also the
conductor of the Luckman Jazz Orchestra, and a number of musicians
and their organizations have spoken out on his behalf. The media
coverage of the case to date has rankled the Beastie Boys who believe
they have been portrayed as overbearing thieves looking to exploit a
jazz academic. For a group accustomed to political and social
advocacy and a well-known dedication to charity, it has been
especially frustrating.</TE>
<TE>   "Before spending a lot of money on the case we contacted Mr.
Newton and offered him a generous out-of-court settlement in hopes of
avoiding further legal fees," Yauch said. "He responded by telling us
that the offer was 'insulting' and said that he wanted 'millions' of
dollars. In addition he told us that he wanted 50% ownership and
control of our song.... Mr. Newton's flute sound is just one of
hundreds of sounds in our song. Giving him 50% ownership of our song
seemed unfair."</TE>
<TE>   The calculus of music creation is a common but tricky practice.
There have been landmark cases involving rap sampling--most notably,
Biz Markie's loss after using "Alone Again" as the core of a
song--and its not unusual for sample-minded artists, such as Sean "P.
Diddy" Combs, to split the profits of a song that hangs its hat on a
previous work.</TE>
<TE>   To Newton, "Choir" is a "defining presence" in the Beastie Boys
song that borrows it. To Yauch it is "a drone in the background" that
has "nothing to do with the central theme of our song."</TE>
<TE>   Either way, "Pass the Mic," remains a Beastie Boys favorite,
popping up in their remixes, their live performances and a recent DVD
release. All of it infuriates Newton who also has to swallow the fact
that his "Choir"--which he composed as an ode to the spiritual music
that inspired him as a youngster--has also made a cameo in the
puerile "Beavis &amp; Butthead" television series thanks to the show's
use of "Pass the Mic."</TE>
<TE>   "This is a work that celebrates God's place in the African
American struggle for freedom in this country," Newton said. "And,
for me, this has become a nightmare."</TE>

<HD>Who Can Edit a Movie? Directors Guild Files Suit</HD>
<DH>Dispute* Companies that delete what they describe as
objectionable material from videos and DVDs violate copyright law,
say the filmmakers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB BAKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Directors Guild of America fired its first legal shot Friday at a
collection of movie-rental and software companies that are digitally
snipping gore, sex and profanity from scores of popular motion
pictures.</LD>
<LD>   In documents filed in federal court in Denver, the DGA asked that
13 companies be ordered to stop violating federal copyright law.</LD>
<LD>   The legal action came after years of verbal scuffling between
directors and a burgeoning movement, centered in Utah but spreading
into other states, that targets consumers who are put off by explicit
films.</LD>
<TE>   Some of the companies--most notably CleanFlicks, head-quartered in
a suburb of Salt Lake City--rent edited videos. Other companies sell
software that lets consumers, via their computers or DVD players,
edit a DVD copy of a movie to a variety of specifications.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the companies have sprouted recently to take advantage of
the ease of digitally changing content. Many of the operators of the
companies contend they are trying to give consumers no more than the
sanitizing studios already do when they release films for viewing on
commercial airplanes or network television.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Roth, national executive director of the DGA, called the
editing "a direct frontal assault on all aspects of ownership and
creativity" because the changes were made without any consultation.</TE>
<TE>   A CleanFlicks operator in Colorado and a man characterizing
himself as an inventor of software technology filed the original
legal action last month against the DGA and 16 prominent directors.
They said they were taking preemptive action to counter the
anticipated DGA lawsuit. The documents filed Friday by the DGA were
in the form of a counterclaim, asking the federal court to expand the
case to include CleanFlicks' corporate office and the other companies
as targets of the DGA's action.</TE>
<TE>   CleanFlicks contends it does not violate copyright law because it
purchases a new copy each time it edits a film, and because customers
are technically owners of the videos through a co-op arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   CleanFlicks opened its first two stores two years ago, and says it
has 76 outlets operating in 18 states through franchise agreements.
It says its first California outlet is planned for Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   The DGA maintains the process is a violation of federal copyright
law, which holds that only the copyright holder has the right to make
a "derivative" work. Attorneys for companies that produce the edited
videos argue in some cases that the changes are so minor they comply
with a "fair use" exemption in copyright law.</TE>
<TE>   Copyright experts interviewed by The Times agreed with the guild's
position, but cautioned that federal courts in different parts of the
U.S. have issued a variety of interpretations on copyright
infringement in other types of media. They said any initial ruling
seemed likely to wind up in the hands of an appeals court.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter published in the DGA's monthly magazine, now being
mailed to members, the organization's president, Martha Coolidge,
said the controversy centers on a moral question: "Is it right to
take finished films that have been created by someone else, change
them to suit your whims, then profit by the commerce of these grossly
altered products--and at the same time portray these versions as
still being the works of their original directors?"</TE>
<TE>   That argument touches on an international copyright doctrine known
as the "moral right" of a work's creator--the notion that no
distortion of the author's work should be permitted.</TE>
<TE>   The DGA has argued for more than a decade that U.S. copyright law
should be amended to include that provision.</TE>

<HD>Parents Have Homework Too: Staying Informed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABRAHAM HOFFMAN</AU>
<BD>Abraham Hoffman teaches history at Los Angeles Valley
College. He retired from the LAUSD in 1999 after teaching there for
more than 30 years.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the new school year begins, everyone is optimistic. Teachers tell
themselves this year will be different, that they'll crack the
barrier and actually reach and teach their students. Students figure
it's a new year and a fresh start, at least until the first homework
assignment they neglect to do or the first test they don't study for.
And parents--well, parents want a safe school environment and their
children to get good grades and a good education.</LD>
<LD>   So much for the expectations. How about the reality? Will it be
another year of burnout and low morale for teachers, apathy and lack
of achievement from students and parental unhappiness because the
schools aren't "doing their job"?</LD>
<LD>   Parents of schoolchildren often take things for granted that they
should be monitoring. They complain in the 19th week of the semester
that their middle or high school child is failing classes. "Why
wasn't I told?" they demand to know. Well, they need to know this
essential fact: Schools inform parents periodically of their child's
progress in school, usually at the fifth, 10th and 15th weeks, with a
final grade at the 20th week. Teachers are also required to send home
a course outline and explanation of grading standards.</LD>
<TE>   In many ways these communications become a game. Teachers record
the grades and the computer creates the progress report, but getting
it home to the parent becomes someone else's problem. Because of
budgetary considerations, many schools mail home only the 10th-and
20th-week grades. The fifth-and 15th-week progress reports are given
to the child to be hand-carried home. Students often don't do this,
either throwing the progress report away or else forging a parent's
signature. And parents remain in blissful ignorance.</TE>
<TE>   The time is long overdue for parents to wake up and be aware that
these progress reports periodically inform them how their child is
doing in school. There is no reason to be surprised at the final
grade if the parents have been receiving the progress reports and
doing their share in seeing that their children do the homework and
studying necessary for a good grade.</TE>
<TE>   One way for parents to become aware of these communications
between school and home is to create a "parent awareness calendar."
Call the school for the dates of important school events. Get
suspicious if your child volunteers to "bring in the mail" at certain
times of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Parents should be aware that, at some time in the semester,
schools have open houses and "back to school" nights. Students are
notorious for throwing away the bulletins announcing such events, yet
the event is crucial for parental involvement. Usually a high school
gets about 300 parents attending; that's about one out of 10 parents
and, as the teachers note, never the ones they really want to see.</TE>
<TE>   Many teachers also issue a special report to parents when a
student is doing failing work. These may be given to the student or
mailed home. Copies of these reports are kept in the student's file.
Parents who complain that they didn't receive notice that their child
is failing a class have no one to blame but themselves. Students who
tell their parents they don't have any homework, day after day, are
not telling the truth. These parents need to let their children know
they are on to such falsehoods and that they will contact the school
to find out what is going on if they don't get the reports.</TE>
<TE>   None of the above is meant to be cynical. But teachers really
don't want to get phone calls from parents who have awakened too late
to remedy their child's poor grades.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A bill awaiting Gov. Gray Davis' signature would involuntarily commit
mentally ill people to outpatient treatment programs based on the
decision of a court-ordered hearing. Not sticking with a treatment
course and committing a serious act of violence against oneself or
others are some of the criteria to be considered in making this
determination. KAREN KARLITZ spoke with an opponent of the measure,
AB 1421.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   SALLY ZINMAN</LD>
<TE>   Executive director, California Network of Mental Health Clients</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This bill speaks of an array of services for those with
psychiatric disabilities, but we believe it is really about forced
medication, which is detrimental to people's recovery as well as to
their civil rights.</TE>
<TE>   Recovery is about self-determination and choice, about people
being partners in their treatment and life plans. This is not a new
concept. Physically disabled people have been talking about it for
many years.</TE>
<TE>   Recovery from psychiatric disabilities is possible. I was
diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia a long time ago, and I have
recovered.</TE>
<TE>   A few exemplary mental health service models were initiated in the
last several years. The Village in Long Beach, for example, offers
voluntary rehabilitative services including housing, income support,
jobs and job training, and socialization. Its success has been
phenomenal.</TE>
<TE>   But AB 1421 would undermine this exceptional program.</TE>
<TE>   When you use force, you drive people away. Psychiatrically
disabled people are no different from anyone else. They don't want to
be forced to do things, and when they are, they have a tendency to
run in the other direction.</TE>
<TE>   A 1989 California Department of Health study, the Well Being
Project, found that about 55% of those who had experienced forced
treatment later refused all mental health treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Also, if you mix voluntary patients with involuntary ones, it
changes the nature of the program.</TE>
<TE>   There's no argument that people out there are suffering, that many
of the homeless have mental disabilities (although a lower percentage
than people think) and that some end up in jails instead of receiving
mental health services. Proponents of this bill say this is because
of problems with the current laws. We think it's a failure of the
system, which rarely provided the voluntary community services
promised when most of the state mental hospitals were closed.</TE>
<TE>   The bill has moved forward, I believe, because of the stereotypes
and stigma surrounding people with psychiatric disabilities. One
stereotype has it that they're violent. But in the words of the U.S.
surgeon general in a 1999 report: "The overall contribution of mental
disorders to the total level of violence in society is exceptionally
small."</TE>
<TE>   A second stereotype is that the psychiatrically disabled are
childlike and therefore need others to make decisions for their own
protection. This too has been disproved.</TE>
<TE>   But all the research and reports don't seem to matter. Exploiting
centuries-old stereotypes is how this bill reached the governor's
desk.</TE>
<TE>   Another problem with this proposed legislation is that it views
medication as a magic bullet without side effects. The truth is,
medication doesn't always work. Many patients try various drugs
before finding one that is effective, and in time it too may stop
working. When people reject services, we should look at why instead
of automatically assuming it's because they're incapable of making
good decisions.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A bill called "the Innocence Protection Act" sounds mushy until one
notes that for every seven people executed since 1977, one person on
death row is eventually exonerated by new evidence. Among those
cleared was Anthony Porter of Illinois, who was only hours from death
in 1999 when a judge stayed his execution. He later was released
after a man came forward and admitted to the double homicide that had
put Porter in prison for 17 years.</LD>
<LD>   Stories like Porter's have made even some government officials who
support capital punishment in theory--Illinois Gov. George Ryan, for
instance--queasy over how it is imposed in practice. The tales of
indisputable injustice so disturbed Ryan that two years ago he called
a halt to executions in his state until he was satisfied that the
death penalty was being imposed fairly and appropriately. He's still
not satisfied. Nor is the chief judge of Delaware's Superior Court,
who this month halted capital trials in that state pending further
review.</LD>
<TE>   Even the U.S. Supreme Court, which permitted states to reinstate
capital punishment in 1976, seems to be taking another look, based in
part on growing public concerns about who is sentenced to death and
in what circumstances. Last term, the court held the execution of
mentally retarded felons to be unconstitutional and many observers
believe that the court may rule this term on whether juveniles should
be spared as well.</TE>
<TE>   Manifold problems send to death row innocent people and those
society usually holds less than fully responsible for their
actions--teenagers and people with mental retardation, for instance.</TE>
<TE>   Some states, including Texas, have set competency standards so low
for lawyers who represent capital defendants in recent years that
even counselors who are asleep or drunk during portions of their
client's trial have not been disqualified. Many states pay such a
pittance for the months, sometimes years of work involved in
representing these mostly indigent clients that they often draw from
the bottom rungs of the profession. States also vary widely in how
carefully their appellate courts review death sentences and how they
collect, test and preserve DNA and other evidence that can help
convict or exonerate a defendant.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed Innocence Protection Act, a bipartisan bill making
its way through Congress, would help reserve death row for the
guilty. It would provide set federal standards for the collection and
testing of DNA evidence and provide money to states that adopt those
standards. The bill also would establish a grant program to encourage
states to improve their capital defense programs. States that accept
the money must agree to give these cases only to lawyers who meet
basic competency standards--and to pay them appropriately.</TE>
<TE>   The measure passed the Senate Judiciary Committee this summer with
Republican support. An identical House measure, with backing from 250
Republicans and Democrats--some of whom support the death
penalty--awaits action by the House Judiciary Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Some 3,700 men and women around the nation now have a date with
the executioner. The prospect that innocent people could be among
them should frighten every American.</TE>

<LD>Ah, to stroll the backcountry, accompanied only by bees flitting in
the chaparral.</LD>
<LD>   Ah, to canter up a canyon, human and horse moving in primal
cooperation.</LD>
<LD>   Ah, to pedal down a dirt path, heart and lungs pumping as knobby
tires spit stones.</LD>
<TE>   Argh, to hike into the flailing hoofs of an outraged Appaloosa,
whose rider is cramming dirt into the nostrils of the keening
mountain biker who careered into her horse.</TE>
<TE>   Forget geopolitical animosities. For real conflict, watch hikers,
equestrians and mountain bikers battle over who has the right to use
the nation's trails and the fire, mining and logging roads that
crisscross public land. Fortunately, the Bureau of Land Management,
which oversees 14 million acres in California alone, has just
introduced guidelines that should help bring peace to wild America.</TE>
<TE>   The BLM's plan, open for public comment via the bureau's Web site
until Sept. 25, will encourage local groups to help determine which
trails are best suited for which types of recreation and encourage
the sort of self-policing that is imperative given the dearth of
rangers patrolling the desert and mountain land the agency oversees.</TE>
<TE>   In recognizing the often maligned sport of mountain biking as a
legitimate public land activity, the BLM undercuts those who argue
that wild lands can be relished only on foot or horseback. The plan
could also help set a reasonable course for other national and local
agencies governing forests and parks.</TE>
<TE>   Trail sharing is particularly important in Southern California,
where rapidly shrinking open spaces serve as pressure-release valves
for increasing numbers of stressed urbanites. Wilderness areas and
some fragile trails are not suited for bicycles. But in most places,
the sort of cooperation and compromise that the BLM's plan encourages
should smooth the way for horses, hikers and nonmotorized bikes to
coexist, if not in blissful harmony then at least without eye-gouging
conflict.</TE>

<LD>The September issue of Arab-American Business magazine took on added
meaning with the arrests of five Arab Americans in upstate New York.
The Huntington Beach-based publication usually fills its pages with
stories of Arab Americans who've achieved success in business. But
this month's cover--featuring the now-ominous 9/11 date superimposed
in black over a color photograph of the Statue of Liberty--offers a
sober look at how the terrorist attacks are reshaping the lives of
Arab Americans.</LD>
<LD>   The inside cover unintentionally sets the tone with a four-color
CIA recruitment ad. The smiling face of an Arab American man invites
readers who speak Arabic, Dari/Pashto, Persian or Urdu, who "have
what it takes"--and can pass a polygraph test--to apply for service
as a Middle Eastern specialist. The ad notes: "There's never been a
better time to serve."</LD>
<LD>   A few pages later is an "open letter to Arab-Americans" from the
head of the FBI's civil rights section. The official emphasizes the
agency's pledge to investigate hate crimes directed at Arab
Americans. But the letter also acknowledges "inevitable growing
pains" in the relationship between the FBI and the Arab American
community, including the divisive matter of racial profiling by law
enforcement agencies.</LD>
<TE>   Though the magazine circulates largely among Arab Americans, the
issue should hit home with anyone who is concerned about a dangerous
clash between national security needs and constitutional rights. The
lead editorial acknowledges that Americans now have much to fear. It
adds that, "Unlike many of our fellow Americans, however, our fear is
twofold: Not only must we be wary of attacks by extremists on our
government, our country and our way of life, we also must be fearful
of our government itself with respect to our individual rights."</TE>
<TE>   The arrests in New York illustrate the necessary but painful
balance the country must strive toward as it struggles to identify
threats to the common good without stepping on the constitutional
rights of its citizens. Law enforcement credits Arab Americans in
Lackawanna, N.Y., with providing important information that led to
the investigation and arrests. But, in subsequent interviews, friends
and neighbors in that Buffalo suburb complained that many in this
nation now view their Arab American compatriots as suspect simply
because of their heritage.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of Sept. 11, reported hate crimes against Arab
Americans--or people apparently targeted because they looked Arab
American--soared from just three incidents in California in 2000 to
73 in 2001. This isn't just ill-mannered name-calling. The state
attorney general's hate crimes report says that almost half of
reported hate crimes involve assault and other types of violence. The
report, coupled with the high-profile arrests, frames the hard but
necessary challenge of fighting a war against domestic terrorism that
doesn't trample individual rights.</TE>

<LD>"Parents Fight Changes in Special Ed" (Sept. 16) discusses how many
parents of children needing special education services are balking at
the efforts of the L.A. Unified School District to offer such
services at public schools rather than paying for expensive private
schools. Parents in West L.A. and the West Valley, in particular, are
pursuing litigation because they can afford to and have private
schools available to them.</LD>
<LD>   I realize that this process of subsidized private education can be
abused by the rich and greedy. However, what many parents are
reacting to is not simply the effort to educate such students at
public schools, but rather the plan to educate these students by
simply placing them in regular classes.</LD>
<LD>   As a fourth-grade teacher, I have had a number of students with
special educational needs in my class who have done well, who have
been accepted by their peers and who have shown great resiliency and
motivation. However, not all students with such needs can function
within a regular class, and right now the tendency within L.A.
Unified is to push all children toward the regular classroom. I
question whether such an approach is warranted.</LD>
<TE>   Right now I have 32 students and am told I can go up to 36.
Managing a class of that size so that effective learning occurs is
serious business. Every teacher knows how just one student who is
disruptive can shatter the balance needed. Many students with serious
special needs do not mean to be disruptive, but their behaviors can
simply be incompatible with the needs of the other students in the
room. Nor can sufficient attention be paid to their needs in a
crowded classroom.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Unified needs to very carefully examine the compatibility of
special needs students and the regular classroom to make sure that
optimal learning for all students can occur. Saving money is not the
bottom line. Treating special education teachers and the special
education programs of the LAUSD with more support and respect would
be a good place to start. Then perhaps many parents who are trying to
stay out of the district will feel comfortable returning, knowing
that their child's needs are taken seriously.</TE>

<TE>   I am a former teacher who retired from the LAUSD after 39 years of
teaching elementary school. I also held counseling and administrative
credentials. I spent 32 years teaching in the East Valley, where
parents often did not know their rights, could not afford to have
attorneys represent them or both.</TE>
<TE>   In my experience, the LAUSD often failed to meet the needs of
children with learning disabilities. Administrators were reluctant to
qualify students for special services. The referral process was so
extensive and complex that a whole school year could pass without the
child being evaluated. The criteria for students to receive services
kept changing, becoming more and more restrictive so fewer students
qualified for fewer special education programs.</TE>
<TE>   I would hope that the parents who can afford to sue will
ultimately benefit all the students who are being shortchanged.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a frequent consultant (to both parents and attorneys) in cases
regarding school placement of children with various developmental
disorders, I want to point out that school districts also fight
parents who request a regular education placement--as opposed to
special class placement--for their children. In one such instance,
L.A. Unified insisted on a costly, self-contained special ed class
instead of allowing the child (who had autism but was functioning at
a high level) to remain in the regular classroom. Special education
is often a one-way street; kids get in but rarely get moved out
without the expense and stress of litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of which services parents are requesting--costly
private or home programs or regular education settings--the process
has become inequitable. L.A. Unified spent $2.7 million on attorney
fees alone last year--money that would be much better spent on
providing more appropriate programs for kids who have problems that
are just not met adequately by the district.</TE>

<LD>Mike Males' "High Crimes and Misdemeanors" (Opinion, Sept. 15) gives
the dangerous and faulty impression that marijuana is no more harmful
for adolescents than for adults. The "Marijuana Myths, Marijuana
Facts" reference he provides for this statement is 5 years old. A
recent study revealed that people who begin smoking marijuana before
age 17 have smaller brains and less gray matter than those who start
smoking later in life. Data from adults show no differences in brain
structure between marijuana smokers and nonsmokers.</LD>
<LD>   I'm all for the rights of adolescents, but some activities are
best begun later in life. We don't give chainsaws to 5-year-olds. We
don't let 12-year-olds drive cars. Marijuana simply is not for
children.</LD>
<LD>   Mitchell Earleywine</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What Males points out is the reality that the U.S. cannot have a
rational discussion of drug use because our drug laws are so
intimately connected with our prejudices. Our drug laws have always
been based on our racial, ethnic and class prejudices. These are
grounded in feelings of white superiority, fear and loathing. Our
very first anti-drug law addressed the use of opium by the Chinese in
San Francisco. Marijuana became a problem when it was an alternative
for middle-class white Americans during Prohibition and later when it
crossed the color line on college campuses.</TE>
<TE>   America's "war" on drugs has been, in fact, a war on race and
class in the guise of a public health debate. This is evident by the
fact that the most dangerous drugs in America, those that claim the
most American lives--alcohol and tobacco--are legal and generally
ignored in the debate about drug use. But before we can move to a
rational discussion on drugs we must face the racism inherent in our
current drug policies.</TE>

<TE>   I am a strong believer that no matter what is legal or illegal,
teenagers do what they want to do. Those in this age group are easily
influenced by the older age group, which they are surrounded by
daily. If a teenager wants to smoke cigarettes illegally or drink
under age, he or she will. Rules are made to be broken.</TE>
<TE>   Marijuana is illegal for any person; however, teenagers and adults
both have their hands on it. If this drug becomes legal it will only
make it easier to consume. The usage won't increase or decrease, it
will only be legal to buy. Legalizing marijuana will not lead to the
abuse of any other illicit drugs, it will only be as common as the
use of alcohol.</TE>

<LD>Re "Van Nuys Flyaway Parking to Be Halved During Expansion Project,"
Sept. 17: The expansion of this location should be but the first in a
regionwide flyaway development project. Given the security, parking
and gridlock obstacles associated with LAX, any effort to lighten the
load there and distribute it regionally should be aggressively
pursued, as this would lead to more efficient and prudent usage of
the real estate available at LAX.</LD>
<LD>   For example, if there were flyaways servicing the South Bay and
Orange County, I know I would greatly prefer those options to
commuting to LAX.</LD>

<LD>I was disappointed to read comments suggesting that the California
Air Resources Board might relax the zero-emission vehicle mandate
("State Takes Sharp Turn on Emissions," Sept. 15). I was more
disappointed, however, that this article appeared to be an open forum
for the always-recalcitrant auto manufacturers to express their
biased views on the success of the electric automobile.</LD>
<LD>   I drive an electric vehicle every day and find it quite adequate
for my needs. Its factory-equipped lead acid batteries allow a top
speed of more than 75 mph and better acceleration than many similar
gasoline vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   The suggestion that zero-emission vehicles are not needed because
of advances in technology being used in gasoline vehicles is
misleading. It does not take into account the upstream sources of
pollution from gasoline vehicles, which are in themselves a major
contributor to both air and water pollution. Nor does it note that
these cars still generate prodigious amounts of greenhouse gases.</LD>

<TE>   Owning an electric car is like death by a thousand cuts, most of
them inflicted by the press. General Motors and the Alliance of
Automobile Manufacturers--and their well-oiled public relations
staffs--deserve the remainder of the credit. Your article repeats
many of the products of this misinformation campaign. The quote from
Greg Dana of the AAM that "the battery electric car is not going to
be viable any time soon. It is dead on arrival" may well be correct
because of the cabal of interests that have served to kill the notion
of a zero-emission vehicle requiring no oil, but it is right for all
the wrong reasons.</TE>
<TE>   When the ZEV mandate was announced a decade ago, I hoped to do my
part by buying an electric car for my in-town driving. Fewer than
1,000 EV1s were built by GM despite a long, unfulfilled waiting list,
yet the small manufacturing base spawned the most vigorous owner's
club I have witnessed. No, the EV1 is not a car for all things or all
people. Neither, in fact, are most cars. What the EV1 can do is
accelerate more briskly than 90% of the cars on the road; have a
lower operating cost than 99% of the cars on the road; make less smog
than a gasoline-powered car that is never driven; and never require
the owner to visit a gas station.</TE>

<TE>   Alan Lloyd, chairman of the state Air Resources Board, states, "We
put a lot of faith in battery electric vehicles ... but, in spite of
significant efforts, batteries have inherent limitations." Indeed
they do, Mr. Lloyd, and you and your colleagues were told that from
Day 1 by engineers and scientists in the automotive industry. I have
a long memory, and hardly a day went by in the early 1990s when this
debate was raging without the environmental crowd blindly accusing
the industry of withholding cleaner technologies and/or of collusion
with the oil industry.</TE>
<TE>   This article further illustrates what I see as a general lack of
scientific literacy in much of the environmental activist community.
That electric power that they had planned to plug into would have
come from coal-, gas-and oil-fired plants--huge, smoking, belching
plants. Those who are quick to tar those in the automotive industry
as avaricious, environmental philistines would do well to gracefully
accept the fact that those who run these businesses share our
environmental concerns as well. They don't enjoy breathing dirty air
any more than we do.</TE>

<TE>   EVs can be real-world vehicles. I drive a converted BMW 2002. The
average U.S. driver covers 25 to 35 miles per day; just plug it in at
night. Therefore, all hybrids must be required to have a 50-mile
electric range--a plug-in hybrid. The benefits will be that most will
drive pollution-free during daily runs and will have a longer range
for trips. Batteries will improve for those who wish to drive
all-electric. Universities build SUVs that do this; GM won't. Why?</TE>

<TE>   Here's the challenge: I'll start my electric Ford Think City

those ultra-clean gasoline cars inside another closed garage and call
me in 15 minutes on your cell phone to let me know how you are doing.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>To quote from "Long-Term Mission Likely at Guantanamo Bay Prison"
(Sept. 13), "As that crucial work continues, [Navy Capt. Bob] Buehn
said he now wonders whether history eventually will remember
Guantanamo Bay not as a unique U.S. military base in a communist
country, but rather as something more akin to the Nuremberg stockade
and trials after World War II."</LD>
<LD>   No. History will remember it as it was--a concentration camp where
people were held without charges and interrogated for months on end,
a concentration camp more akin to the Nazi concentration camps. The
German people allowed those camps because the humans inside were
Jews. We allow these concentration camps to be run with our
knowledge, consent and money because they confine "terrorists." Yet
we do not even define what a terrorist is; the definition would be
thrown back into our own faces, as we commit the same acts on a
wholesale level. We demonize the one whose suffering will cause us
gain. History will show this time as one of wanton greed and
opportunism. Folks will have to choose between human need and greed.</LD>
<LD>   The detainees should be set free and the criminals in our
administration who fabricated this new product, this "war on
terrorism," should be put behind bars. That is the right and just
thing to do.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Liberals at Odds Over Appeals Court Nominee," Sept. 16:
University of Utah law professor Michael McConnell's comparison of
government subsidies of "lewd or sacrilegious art" with government
putting a nativity scene on the city hall lawn, while compelling at
first glance, is wrong. The two expenditures by government are
different.</LD>
<LD>   When government sponsors art for the sake of art, it is not
espousing, encouraging or adopting the views of an individual artist
or encouraging anyone else to espouse or adopt those views. In no
sense are the artist's views being made official. Not even the most
ferocious atheists complain when a government-subsidized museum buys
a traditional religious painting, nor should they.</LD>
<LD>   When the government buys art to adorn its own buildings, it is
indeed espousing, encouraging and adopting the views represented in
that art. If the art is religious, then this is clearly "establishing
religion." If McConnell is such a renowned constitutional scholar,
why can't he see the difference?</LD>

<HD>Fewer 101 Drivers Needed</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Residents Split on 101 Expansion," Sept. 14: I confess that I am
one of the commuters who clog the 101 Freeway through the San
Fernando Valley each day on my way to and from work. My car is larger
than necessary, I don't carpool and I drive when it's convenient to
me. Each day I take 4,500 pounds of steel, glass and rubber with me,
filling the air with poisonous gases as I drive.</LD>
<LD>   I read of Caltrans' meeting to propose solutions to alleviate the
eventual gridlock, but the plans suggested are designed to appease
those who are unwilling to change their habits rather than taking the
strong action we need to quickly remedy the problem of overcrowding.
More construction is not the solution; it is taking the cars off the
road.</LD>
<LD>   Based on my observation, fewer than 10% of the drivers carpool,
and the majority of cars with multiple occupancy have only two
people. An even smaller number of people ride buses, and fewer than
1% ride motorcycles. Caltrans, the MTA and the city, county or both
need to get busy with a plan to coordinate ride-sharing and force
commuters to participate. The Internet can provide a highly efficient
database for carpooling, using readily available data such as
nine-digit ZIP Codes.</LD>
<TE>   Although Caltrans has a telephone system, it appears to be a
failure. So what happens if your neighbor is unwilling to carpool?
Implement the same rules already in use on overtaxed roadways: If you
don't have at least three people in your car, you can't use the road
during rush hour. It is not a pleasant solution, but it is workable.
If my fellow commuters are not willing to make any sacrifice, there
is no reason for me to lead the way--precisely the selfish attitude
that created our current problems.</TE>

<TE>   The options mentioned were adding lanes to the existing 101
Freeway or building an elevated expressway and constructing a
light-rail line. I was a right-of-way agent for 34 years with
Caltrans. I retired two years ago. I am aware that several years ago
Caltrans carried out a feasibility study to put a monorail line
alongside the 405 Freeway, going from LAX to Palmdale.</TE>
<TE>   The study's final analysis concluded that a monorail line would be
compatible with the freeway--and feasible. Therefore, the study for
the 101 Freeway should include consideration of a monorail as a
viable addition to the freeway. The monorail is the future and would
help in unclogging the freeway.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The proposed Ward Valley low-level radioactive waste disposal
facility was not abandoned "because of concerns that radioactivity
could migrate through underground drinking water supplies" (Sept.
13). The Department of Health Services' thorough licensing
process--which culminated in a license in 1993--found that the
project would be safe and environmentally acceptable. AB 2214 blocks
development of the licensed disposal project in the arid Mojave
Desert because our government leaders lack the necessary political
will to move forward.</LD>
<LD>   A National Academy of Sciences report rejected opponents'
contention that the Ward Valley disposal project might threaten the
Colorado River. California's courts upheld the decision to issue the
Ward Valley license. It was issued to a private company that--as the
Legislature requested--had invested its own funds to certify the site
and qualify for the license. The state now faces a $162-million
lawsuit for abandoning the project.</LD>
<LD>   AB 2214 will cost taxpayers millions. Universities, utilities,
medical centers and industries--including biotech and pharmaceutical
industries--face loss of access to disposal facilities in other
states. Californians may find Sacramento's latest infrastructure
mismanagement reminiscent of our recent electricity crisis.</LD>

<LD>Re "Blood Spills to Keep Oil Wealth Flowing," Sept. 15: Our weakness

<LD>   Instead of fighting wars and spilling blood, we should be
developing cleaner sources of energy and encouraging conservation.
There is a great need for better urban planning to reduce congestion
on the freeways. Young Americans need better educational and
recreational opportunities. Instead of closing county health
facilities, let us provide basic necessities, like food, shelter,
education and medical care for all. Thirty million Americans do not
have enough to eat. Let us show the rest of the world how a
government of the people, by the people and for the people works for
the peace and prosperity of all--not just for the CEOs of large
corporations.</LD>

<LD>Three cheers for Irvine Planning Commissioner Anthony Dragun and
Police Chief Mike Berkow for bringing attention to the abuse of
disabled-parking spaces ("Irvine Stalks Parking Spot Scofflaws,"
Sept. 16). I am the secretary for WYNGS (When You Need Group
Support), a nonprofit association that aids people living with spinal
cord injury. We are receiving increasing feedback about this problem
and the incredible insensitivity of those people who illegally take
handicapped-parking spots. They are late or lazy, or maybe they just
have never taken a few minutes to consider the difficulties faced by
someone who is paralyzed and finds all the handicapped spots full.</LD>
<LD>   Those handicapped people have to turn around and go home, or they
are faced with the prospect of maneuvering a wheelchair across a busy
parking lot. Doing so can be extremely dangerous because they are
harder for drivers to see. They cannot cut between cars, as an
able-bodied person might. And just imagine for a moment having to
park in a regular parking space, coming back to your vehicle and not
being able to get in because a car is parked too close to the space
where your ramp needs to come down--there is a reason why those
handicapped spots are so wide.</LD>
<TE>   Maybe it takes a $250 to $1,500 fine from diligent parking
officers for abusers of handicapped placards and parking spaces to
learn; maybe it takes more. Maybe the DMV should start tracking
citations. Or maybe all it takes is a bit of awareness to avoid the
fine. Have a heart and make our community a friendlier place for
people who already have enough challenges to deal with. Whatever it
takes, I hope that Irvine's crackdown does become a model for other
communities.</TE>
<TE>   Wendy Turnbull</TE>
<TE>   Woodland Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Let's not forget those people who take advantage of these spaces
even though the people they are meant for remain in the vehicle as
passengers. Just as bad are those drivers who use these spaces so
that their friends or relatives do not have to walk more than
necessary while they themselves remain in the vehicle. These people
have found a loophole that should be closed. All municipalities
should follow the lead of Irvine and crack down on the entire
problem.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I teach at UCLA, and I regularly see students parking in
handicapped-parking spaces and leaping out of their cars and
sprinting off to class. I have a friend who uses her husband's
handicapped pass to buy gas at service stations because she gets
special consideration. She also uses it when she goes shopping. The
solution is very simple. A photo of the disabled person should be on
the pass and that person must be in the vehicle in order for it to be
parked in a handicapped space.</TE>

<HD>Closing Down of Summer in the High Sierra</HD>
<DH>A season can be felt slipping away in the mountains. Are
the shadows lengthening for the sanctuary of wilderness as well?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS CURWEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Late summer in the Sierra Nevada, and the days are filled with the
premonition of fall. Nights have gone past being nippy, and at noon,
shadows cast by fir trees have the feel of early winter.</LD>
<LD>   We had rented an aluminum skiff with a small outboard, the type
often used by fishermen who troll for trout. It was the second summer
at Huntington Lake for my wife and me, and we don't fish. Instead, we
followed the wooded shoreline past two of the three dams that created
the lake, tucked into the Sierras east of Fresno at 7,000 feet. We
headed to a small east-facing cove, sheltered from the wind and
bathed in early afternoon sunlight.</LD>
<LD>   We tied the skiff to a rock and lay out across the thwarts,
reading out loud a short story by Alistair MacLeod about the end of
summer. "Our footprints of brief moments before already have been
washed away. There remains no evidence that we have ever been. It is
as if we have never lain, nor ever walked, nor ever thought what
thoughts we had. We leave no art or mark behind."</LD>
<TE>   Later, when the sun got too hot for us, we lowered ourselves into
the icy water and afterward had a lunch of leftover tuna fish,
pretzels and beer kept cool in the shallows.</TE>
<TE>   The sky over our heads was piercingly blue. As we lay there,
watching a cloud try to form and disappear as fast, eating the last
of our groceries and recklessly courting a sunburn, we tried to
forget it was our last day in the mountains. But as much as we tried
to hold onto this moment, we felt it slipping away.</TE>
<TE>   In a few weeks, the boats would be hauled from the water, and
docks pulled from the edge of the lake. Cabins, once noisy with the
sound of children's voices and families at reunions, would be
shuttered, mattresses bagged, cookware boxed, chairs and tables
stacked and stored, and the heavy wooden doors swung over the porches
to keep out the snow.</TE>
<TE>   We knew that the end of summer would bring its own hope for
renewal. As the first rains start to fall, tamping the dust into mud,
they hold the promise of a heavy snowpack, and none too soon for
mountains and forests as parched as these.</TE>
<TE>   It was a topic--the weather often is among strangers--dwelt on at
a breakfast hosted each Monday by the managers of the cabins where we
stayed, a rustic hideaway on the southwest corner of the lake.</TE>
<TE>   Over hot cakes, eggs, bacon and coffee, some guests spoke of
drought, others of El Nino. But we all could agree: Rain will be a
blessing for the firefighters still battling a stubborn blaze in the
nearby wilderness. It had first captured our attention two months ago
when it briefly threatened stands of ancient trees.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, the managers told us, the air at the lake grew
eerily still and temperatures shot up to the 80s. Soon, smoke started
drifting in, settling in places as thick as fog. Nothing in a rural
community so terrifies as a forest fire, but a few phone calls later
and everyone's nerves were settled. It was only a change in the wind,
making the fire's breath seem much closer than it was.</TE>
<TE>   But as we listened, we knew somehow this fire had implications for
us.</TE>
<TE>   We knew that people, far away from here, were debating ways
to make these mountains and their small, scattered communities safer.
They were talking about cutting down trees to protect the forest,
about letting more logging companies fell big trees in secluded
glades.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since James Wilson Marshall discovered gold in the foothills
more than 150 years ago, different visions of the Sierra Nevada have
prompted fierce debate.</TE>
<TE>   After nearly 30 years hiking these mountains, John Muir championed
wild parks and forest reservations in an essay in the Atlantic
Monthly.</TE>
<TE>   "The tendency nowadays to wander in wilderness is delightful to
see," he wrote. "Thousands of tired, nerve-shaken, over-civilized
people are beginning to find out that going to the mountains is going
home."</TE>
<TE>   Today, more than ever, wilderness is a sanctuary, a place beyond
the reach of the nightly news, with its constant reminders of
civilization's own savagery.</TE>
<TE>   "Why is it that one week up here goes quicker than one day at
work?" asked one of our neighbors as he packed his car for the drive
home.</TE>
<TE>   The day before, we had taken an unpaved turnoff from the Kaiser
Pass road. Our city car bobbed and weaved across the gullies and
rocks as we followed Sherry Nolen, a naturalist from the visitors
center at Huntington Lake, on the weekly nature hike. A couple from
Palm Desert joined us.</TE>
<TE>   Nolen had promised us a view of the adjoining wilderness and a
short tutorial in the alpine flora of the Sierra. By the time we
reached the 10,000-foot summit northeast of the lake, dust lay thick
upon our car, and before us lay the vast expanses of the John Muir
and Ansel Adams wildernesses, rimmed to the east by the mountain
peaks of the Pacific Crest Trail.</TE>
<TE>   As we wandered along the overlook, we heard the approach of an
all-terrain vehicle. It rumbled up a forest trail, its driver dressed
from head to toe in green camouflage. In his wake, we noticed how the
carpet of star-leafed lupine had been hemmed by this fat-wheeled
vehicle and others like it. Entirely legal, Nolen explained; the
Forest Service had approved the trail for ATV use.</TE>
<TE>   After our walk, we returned to our cars and continued a little
farther down the road to Kaiser Pass Meadow. We scouted out the few
remaining wildflowers growing among the grass, peered into the muddy
stream that had cut a winding, waist-deep gully through the grass and
counted more than two dozen tiny frogs perched on a fallen tree.</TE>
<TE>   Later, lying in our skiff, we put aside thoughts of fires and
chain saws and ATVs. The Sierra has survived centuries of use. One
hundred years ago, we might have fished, as the Indians did, for
salmon in the wild rivers that filled this lake.</TE>
<TE>   Today we idle in waters created by engineers who damned those
rivers to pull electricity from their currents. We revel in the sun
and the soughing of the wind in the trees and, for the moment, forget
about what is lost: the salmon, for example, whose path was blocked
by the dams creating this lake. Instead, we daydream about our own
return next year, putting aside the book by MacLeod and the story we
were reading, the one titled "The Closing Down of Summer."</TE>

<LD>The vast majority of the nation's Catholic dioceses are complying
with new rules on sexual abuse cases adopted by bishops in June,
according to a survey released Friday by the U.S. Conference of
Catholic Bishops. The rules are being reviewed by the Vatican.</LD>
<LD>   Of the 195 archdioceses and dioceses surveyed, 95% responded. Of
those:</LD>
<LD>   * 179 said they have a written policy on sexual abuse available to
the public. Of the six replying in the negative, five said they are
preparing a written policy. One did not answer the question.</LD>
<TE>   * 156 dioceses and archdioceses reported having procedures for
making a complaint readily available, in printed form, and the
subject of a public announcement. Of the 29 replying in the negative,
13 said they plan to comply by October, the rest by the end of the
year.</TE>
<TE>   * 105 dioceses or archdioceses said they report past or old cases
to civil authorities. Forty-eight said they did not and 33 gave
incomplete responses.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>OKLAHOMA CITY--Led by Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, the lay board
monitoring how Roman Catholic bishops comply with the church's new
sex-abuse policy showed critics and doubters this week that it plans
to be much more than a token group.</LD>
<LD>   The National Review Board met for just the second time but was
already in a hurry to perform its duties.</LD>
<LD>   It decided, for instance, that, in a matter of weeks, it will
release the names of any U.S. bishops who are not in compliance with
the clean-up policy the nation's Catholic hierarchy passed in June.
The board was not required to do that for another year or more.</LD>
<TE>   It also asked victims' organizations for their input on which
bishops are not living up to the abuse policy, which calls for any
priest who molests minors to be removed from church work.</TE>
<TE>   It dispatched an urgent request that leaders of men's religious
orders change course and follow the bishops' plan.</TE>
<TE>   "Time is of the essence here," Keating said in an interview. His
position is that the church has been badly damaged by the waves of
scandals, and the board's repair work needs to begin immediately.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>LONDON--The unity of the Anglican communion is increasingly being
subverted by bishops taking unilateral action, mainly on sexual
issues, the archbishop of Canterbury said earlier this week.</LD>
<LD>   Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey, speaking to an Anglican
congress in Hong Kong, criticized both conservatives and liberals who
"seem to be making such decisions without regard to the rest of us."</LD>
<LD>   "This erosion of communion through the adoption of 'local options'
has been going on for some 30 years, but in my opinion is reaching
crisis proportions today," Carey said, in his last address as
president of the Anglican Consultative Council.</LD>
<TE>   He retires in October from his post as leader of the Church of
England and symbolic head of the global Anglican Communion, which has
more than 70 million members. The 2.5 million-member Episcopal Church
is the U.S. branch.</TE>
<TE>   Carey spoke of his concerns about the defrocking of a
traditionalist priest in Pennsylvania, moves to allow lay people to
preside at communion in Sydney, Australia, and a decision in June by
the New Westminster diocese in western Canada to bless same-sex
unions.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the divisions involve "matters to do with sexuality,"
Carey said.</TE>

<LD>BOSTON--While fewer than half of Americans regularly attend religious
services, more than 60% said they pray once or more a day, according
to a poll by the Christian Science Monitor.</LD>
<LD>   A third of those who pray regularly said they had done so more
after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, but more than 60% said the
tragedy had not changed their prayer habits.</LD>
<LD>   Fewer than a third of the more than 900 adults surveyed said the
terrorist strikes had made them more interested in participating in
interfaith services.</LD>
<TE>   Since the war on terror began, many clergy have held worship
services with other denominations to promote religious tolerance.
However, some conservative Christians have resisted, saying
interfaith worship wrongly suggests that all religions are the same.</TE>

<LD>BRANSON, Mo.--Television evangelist Jim Bakker, who was convicted of
wire fraud and served five years in prison, plans to start another TV
ministry, this time in Branson.</LD>
<LD>   Bakker said he has commitments from stations in several cities to
broadcast his new show, which will originate from a restaurant.</LD>
<LD>   The 62-year-old former Assemblies of God minister said he is weeks
away from launching the hourlong show. His wife--Lori Graham
Bakker--will co-host.</LD>
<TE>   During the 1970s and '80s, Bakker broadcast as head of PTL
Ministries with his then-wife, Tammy Faye Bakker. He resigned from
PTL in 1987 after he admitted having an affair with a ministry
secretary, Jessica Hahn. Soon afterward, he and other ministry
officials were implicated in a fraud scheme.</TE>
<TE>   While he was in prison, Tammy Faye divorced him.</TE>
<TE>   "We serve a God of the second chance," Bakker said of his new
venture.</TE>

<HD>Evangelical Faiths, Mormon Church Grow Rapidly</HD>
<DH>Survey: Membership of liberal Protestant denominations
declined in the past decade, national study finds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RACHEL ZOLL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Mormon church and evangelical faiths grew during the past decade
while more liberal Protestant denominations shrank, according to a
new census of U.S. religions conducted by a Roman Catholic research
group.</LD>
<LD>   The study found the Los Angeles metropolitan area was the most
diverse urban center, with 106 different denominations reporting
members. Illinois was the most diverse state, with 120 different
faiths, according to the data from the 2000 Religious Congregations &amp;
Membership study.</LD>
<LD>   Nationwide, the Roman Catholic Church posted strong growth while
its population shifted, the study found. More Catholics now live in
the West than the traditionally Catholic Midwest, and the Catholic
population in the South grew faster than it did in the Northeast.</LD>
<TE>   "That has a lot to do with the growth of the Hispanic population
in the United States," said researcher Clifford Grammich, who
collected Catholic figures for the study. "How well the church has
been holding onto Hispanic Catholics, a study like this can't
determine."</TE>
<TE>   The survey is conducted once a decade.</TE>
<TE>   The latest version includes Muslims for the first time, finding
1.6 million in the United States. The count was lower by millions
than in some other surveys, but researchers said the figure was only
a tally of those active in mosques, not the total American Muslim
population. Estimates of all Muslims vary dramatically, with some
Muslim organizations claiming 6 million, while others estimate 2
million.</TE>
<TE>   The study put the Jewish population at 6 million, but that number
includes Jews who are not members of congregations and therefore is
difficult to compare to the other figures in the study, said the Rev.
Dale Jones, a minister in the Church of the Nazarene who oversaw the
survey.</TE>
<TE>   The fastest-growing major denomination in the study was the Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The Assemblies of God, a
Pentecostal denomination, followed closely behind. The Mormon church
grew about 19% to 4.2 million members, while the Assemblies of God
grew nearly as quickly to 2.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   The study was conducted by the Glenmary Research Center in
Nashville, a Catholic research and social service organization that
coordinates the study with analysts from several faiths. The U.S.
Census Bureau does not collect information on religion.</TE>
<TE>   The 149 participating faiths sent membership estimates to
Glenmary, which adjusted the figures to make them comparable.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said one of the most troubling trends was that, in most
areas, religious groups failed to increase the percentage of members
compared with the total population. This was especially pronounced in
the West, where denominations claim the smallest percentage of
members.</TE>
<TE>   People there "consider themselves religious, but some will say you
don't need to belong to a church to be religious," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   The evangelical Southern Baptist Convention grew by only 4.9%
during the last decade, but remained the nation's largest Protestant
group, with nearly 20 million members, according to Glenmary.</TE>
<TE>   Roman Catholics remained the largest denomination in the country,
growing 16% to 62 million believers. The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)
was among moderate and liberal Protestant denominations posting a
significant loss, dropping by nearly 12% to 3.1 million. Mainline
Protestant churches have been losing members for decades.</TE>
<TE>   Predominantly black denominations, such as the National Baptist
Convention, did not participate in the study, since many lack the
resources to count their membership.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Religion in America</TE>
<TE>   The Catholic Church is the largest in the United States.
Denominations within the Protestant churches collectively have 66
million adherents, with Southern Baptists being the largest group.</TE>

<HD>Greek Orthodox Cathedral Is Reaching Beyond Ethnic Roots</HD>
<DH>Ecumenism: St. Sophia Church and its Latino neighbors are
finding a unity of spirit that was long lacking.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For 50 years, the stunning edifice of L.A.'s other cathedral--St.
Sophia Greek Orthodox Church near downtown Los Angeles--has survived
essentially unchanged. This "crown jewel" among Orthodox Christian
churches still glitters with imported crystal chandeliers, dramatic
religious icons and an interior awash in 24-carat gold leaf. It was
designed, says Father John Bakas, to remind worshipers that "light
comes from within."</LD>
<LD>   The liturgy remains virtually identical to services offered
centuries ago, since the days of the early church--albeit with more
English these days than Greek.</LD>
<LD>   But as the golden cathedral approaches its golden anniversary,
dramatic changes are taking place inside. Once an insular Greek
enclave in the largely poor, crime-ridden Latino neighborhood, the
congregation has began to reach out in many directions.</LD>
<TE>   "We can no longer be just an ethnic church," says Bakas, dean of
the cathedral. "If you try to stay that way, you will become
irrelevant in American society."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, St. Sophia has helped start a free summer camp
for underprivileged youth, raised funds to help provide uniforms for
a nearby public school and counseling, art and tutoring programs.
After a three-decade hiatus, the church has restarted its annual
Greek Festival, which fits its neighborhood by putting a Cuban show
band alongside Greek dancing and dolmas up against a margarita booth
and tacos with lamb and feta cheese.</TE>
<TE>   Church leaders have spearheaded monthly town hall meetings to
bring neighbors together, air concerns to local officials and help
the area's immigrant population learn to demand services and
participate in the democratic process.</TE>
<TE>   When the meetings first started in 1996, some drew as few as five
people. Many immigrants who fled corrupt Latin American regimes
without legal papers were fearful of authority figures, church
members say. Today, the meetings draw as many as 200 people to quiz
representatives from law enforcement, education and government.</TE>
<TE>   And St. Sophia has been a driving force in transforming the
neighborhood from an embattled bus corridor between downtown and the
Pico district into a bustling business district officially christened
the "Byzantine-Latino Quarter." An associated nonprofit corporation,
the members of which include St. Sophia, St. Thomas the Apostle
Catholic Church, two Catholic schools and local merchants, has won
more than $3 million in grants for neighborhood improvements such as
street cleaning, tree planting, better lighting and art projects.</TE>
<TE>   At the corner of Pico and Normandie, a once-nondescript office
building now displays a huge mural of two angels and the quote, "We
are each of us angels with one wing. We can only fly embracing each
other."</TE>
<TE>   "For the better part of 50 years, we were an island in a sea of
Latinos,'' said Ted Pastras, president of the St. Sophia parish
council board of directors. "But if you're really there to promote
Christianity and do outreach, as Christ did, then you really have to
reach out and embrace everyone."</TE>
<TE>   Pastras and others say many of the changes have been sparked by
Father Bakas, 56, an effusive, dynamic man who was born in Greece,
raised in New Mexico and assigned to Los Angeles in 1995. An
amalgamation of spiritual leader and tireless salesman, Bakas rolls
out a passionate vision in which religious and civic forces are
marshaled to unify neighbors and improve an area troubled by some of
the highest crime, poverty levels and unemployment rates in the city.</TE>
<TE>   As the tall, bearded Bakas strolled through the streets in his
black clerical garb one day recently, he called out to merchants and
passersby in a booming voice and fluent Spanish. At one corner, he
pointed out a shopping mall that the absentee landlord was forced to
bring up to code after community members alerted city officials to
myriad violations.</TE>
<TE>   At El Farolito restaurant, owner Yolanda Rodriguez motioned him
inside. "Father, there are some people here who really want to meet
you," she said. A group of men were downing burritos smothered with
melted cheese and green tomatillo sauce, designated the "Father John
Special" on the menu, and they wanted to know if such a man really
existed.</TE>
<TE>   "Before Father John came, everyone was isolated and only focused
on themselves," said Rodriguez. "He is a blessing to the community
because he's brought us all together and made us a community that
helps each other out."</TE>
<TE>   The Orthodox priest, who is married with four children, brings his
Bible study class to Rodriguez's restaurant every week. He encourages
his congregation to also patronize local businesses instead of
rushing back to their own suburban neighborhoods after services. "Now
I have so many Greek customers," Rodriguez said, a phenomenon that
began only after Bakas arrived at St. Sophia.</TE>
<TE>   The priest said his passion to reach out was inspired partly by an
encounter he had shortly after arriving in Los Angeles. He was
invited, without knowing why, to meet the widow of a Japanese
diplomat named Chiune Sugihara. The mystery deepened when he arrived
at the mayor's office and saw several rabbis there. He was told that
Sugihara, at the cost of his own career, had helped save thousands of
Jews in Lithuania during World War II by giving them transit visas in
defiance of government orders.</TE>
<TE>   Then Bakas learned the reason he was invited: Sugihara's actions,
the diplomat's family said, were propelled by his faith as a member
of the Greek Orthodox Church.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's a man who did not take the comfortable road, who reached
out beyond himself and did something sacrificial in providing service
to others at the expense of himself," Bakas said, tearing up even
today as he recounted the story. "Sugihara had a tremendous impact on
how I perceive my ministry."</TE>
<TE>   Bakas' vision meshed perfectly with people like Pastras, who had
started a culture and civic affairs department at the church a year
earlier to try to start reaching out. Bakas was the sparkplug,
Pastras says.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California's Greek Orthodox community traces its roots to
1906, when members began raising money to build their first church at
12th and San Julian streets in what is now downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   According to longtime church member Faye Demetriou, the aftermath
of World War II brought an influx of Greeks to the region, and they
quickly outgrew the original church. As satellite churches began
popping up in the region--there are now 17, Pastras said--a move
began to build a new cathedral that would serve as the mother church
for both the local community and the Western United States.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the cathedral efforts found a champion in Charles P.
Skouras, a Greek immigrant who became the owner of 20th-Century Fox
movie theaters across the country and raised $1.5 million to finish
the church, which was designed to replicate the denomination's
original mother church in Constantinople--now the site of a mosque.</TE>
<TE>   The church begins its weeklong anniversary celebration with an
ecumenical service Sunday, at which the Rev. Robert Schuller of the
Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove will deliver the keynote address.
Next Saturday, a black-tie dinner will mark the exact day 50 years
ago that the church was consecrated. A liturgical service the next
day will feature one of the cathedral's original priests, the Rev.
Anthony Kostouros.</TE>
<TE>   "The anniversary will honor those who sacrificed to leave us this
golden jewel of life," Bakas said, waving toward the double-domed
cathedral. "We have to merit this gift by being bearers of light to
all through service, good works, love and charity."</TE>

<HD>Quita Brodhead, 101; Pennsylvania Artist's Work Spanned 80
Years</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Quita Brodhead, a painter whose colorful work over 80 years ranged
from still lifes to lyrical abstracts, died of colon cancer Sept. 4
at a hospital in Bryn Mawr, Pa. She was 101.</LD>
<LD>   Brodhead, who was painting daily through the last years of her
life, was honored with a retrospective of her work around her 100th
birthday, March 5, 2001, at the Hollis Taggart Galleries in New York.</LD>
<LD>   Her work has been collected by the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the
Delaware Art Museum, the Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute in
Utica, N.Y., and elsewhere.</LD>
<TE>   She was born Marie Wagaman Berl in Wilmington, Del., but her
father called her Mariequita (little Marie in Spanish) to avoid
confusion with her mother, Marie.</TE>
<TE>   She was known throughout her life by her nickname, Quita.</TE>
<TE>   She attended the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and later
became a student of the Philadelphia painter Arthur B. Carles, who
had studied Matisse, Picasso and Cezanne in Paris. Those influences
were apparent in his work and later in Brodhead's.</TE>
<TE>   Brodhead traveled and painted in France during the 1920s,
returning to the United States in 1927.</TE>
<TE>   With a friend, she founded the Wayne Art Center in Pennsylvania in
1930, and spent most of her life in Wayne.</TE>
<TE>   Her early work, mainly still lifes and nudes, shows
impressionistic leanings.</TE>
<TE>   Brodhead's painting became more abstract in the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   By the '60s, space exploration fed her curiosity about science and
mathematics, particularly chaos theory, and helped shape the themes
of her later work.</TE>
<TE>   New York Times critic Grace Glueck, in a review of her centennial
show last year, wrote:</TE>
<TE>   "The gifts of long life and the talent to live it rewardingly do
not go to many. Ms. Brodhead is quite simply a phenomenon."</TE>
<TE>   Her survivors include a daughter, two sons, and several
grandchildren and great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Necdet Kent, 91; Turkish Diplomat Saved Jews in WWII</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Necdet Kent, a Turkish diplomat who risked his life to save Jews
during World War II in a little-known chapter of Holocaust history,
has died. He was 91.</LD>
<LD>   The Turkish Foreign Ministry said Kent died Friday in Istanbul.
The cause of death was not disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   Kent was the Turkish consul general in the French port city of
Marseille from 1941 to 1944.</LD>
<TE>   One evening in 1943, he was alerted by a Jewish worker at the
consulate that 80 Turkish Jews living in Marseille had been rounded
up and packed into cattle cars bound for Germany and certain death.</TE>
<TE>   He rushed to Marseille's St. Charles train station, where he found
a wagon crammed with Jews, moaning and sobbing, piled one on top of
another.</TE>
<TE>   "To this day," he told the Jerusalem Post a few years ago, "I
remember the inscription on the wagon: 'This wagon may be loaded with
20 head of cattle and 500 kilograms of grass.' "</TE>
<TE>   The Gestapo commander at the station approached him angrily and
asked why he was there. Kent replied that the Jews were Turkish
citizens and must be released, but the commander dismissed him,
saying that they were "not Turks or anything of the sort, but just
plain Jews."</TE>
<TE>   Ignoring the Nazi officer and a soldier attempting to block his
passage, Kent boarded the train.</TE>
<TE>   At the next station, he was met by German officers who apologized
that the train had left Marseille before letting him disembark. They
told him they had a car ready to take him back.</TE>
<TE>   "I explained to them that there was no question of a mistake, that
more than 80 Turkish citizens had been loaded onto these animal
wagons because they were Jews, and that I was a representative of a
government that rejected such treatment," Kent recalled.</TE>
<TE>   The Germans were dumbfounded by his courageous stand. They asked
if everyone on the train was Turkish. Hearing no exceptions, they let
everyone off the train.</TE>
<TE>   The Jews, who were sent to Istanbul for the duration of the war,
flung their arms around Kent in gratitude.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot forget those embraces around our necks and hands.... The
inner peace I felt when I reached my bed towards morning that day is
one that I have not savored much since then."</TE>
<TE>   Kent was one of several Turkish officials who helped to rescue
Jews in Nazi-occupied France. Turkish diplomats protested French
government orders that Jews wear a yellow star and helped many
Turkish Jews travel safely to Turkey. Historians have credited
Turkey, which was a neutral country, with saving the lives of 20,000
Jews during the war.</TE>
<TE>   After World War II, Kent served at Turkey's consulate in New York
and was ambassador to Thailand, New Delhi, Sweden and Poland.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, he and two other diplomats, Namik Kemal Yolga and
Selahattin Ulkumen, were honored with Turkey's Supreme Service Medal,
as well as a special medal from Israel for rescuing Jews during the
Holocaust.</TE>
<TE>   "I admire and respect and thank you to no end for what you did to
save our Jewish brothers at the darkest moment in history," Uri
Bar-Ner, then Israel's ambassador to Turkey, said at the ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   There was no immediate information on survivors.</TE>
<TE>   Kent's funeral was scheduled for Sept. 23.</TE>

<HD>Tony Martinez, 82; Actor Was Among First Latinos on TV</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tony Martinez, the bandleader-turned-actor who played the farm hand
Pepino on "The Real McCoys" and was one of the few Latino faces on
network television in the 1950s and early '60s, has died. He was 82.</LD>
<LD>   Martinez died Monday of natural causes in a hospital in Las Vegas,
according to his wife of 21 years, Myra.</LD>
<LD>   Over four decades, Martinez played Sancho Panza in 2,245
performances of "Man of La Mancha," including the national company
tour of the Tony-winning musical in the late 1960s and two later
national revival tours, all of which ended up on Broadway.</LD>
<TE>   The actor first joined the national "Man of La Mancha" company in
1967 and over the years he played opposite a dozen different
Quixotes, including Richard Kiley, Jose Ferrer and Raul Julia.</TE>
<TE>   "The best time he had was spent in the theater," his wife said.
"That's the reason he came back so many times."</TE>
<TE>   For millions of seasoned television viewers, however, Martinez is
best remembered for his role in "The Real McCoys," the rural
situation comedy about a West Virginia mountain family that moved to
a farm in the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The popular series, which aired from 1957 to 1963, starred Walter
Brennan as cantankerous Grandpa Amos McCoy and Richard Crenna and
Kathleen Nolan as newlyweds Luke and Kate McCoy.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez played the Mexican farmhand Pepino Garcia, who, as a
character on the show put it, "came with the house."</TE>
<TE>   "He was just a natural, and he had this enormous sense of comedy
timing," Nolan recalled this week. "He was surrounded by three
people--me, Walter Brennan and Dick Crenna--who were experienced
actors, and he was just right on the button."</TE>
<TE>   Martinez came to acting by way of his music.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Puerto Rico in 1920, he studied music in his native San
Juan before moving to New York to study at Juilliard.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez, who played five instruments and sang, formed his own
small band in New York in the 1940s: Tony Martinez and His
Mambo-USA..</TE>
<TE>   He later studied acting at the Pasadena Playhouse and landed small
parts in a number of movies in the late 1940s and early '50s. He also
appeared as himself, with his band, in the movie musical "Rock Around
the Clock," starring Bill Haley and the Comets.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez and his band were playing at a club on the Sunset Strip
when he was discovered by TV writer-producers Irving and Norman
Pincus, who were looking for someone to play the Pepino character on
their new sitcom.</TE>
<TE>   "When they asked him to come in for the part, he didn't bother to
call back because he thought it was a joke, and then they pursued
him," Nolan recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Nolan, who served as president of the Screen Actors Guild from
1975 to 1980, called Martinez's casting "a major breakthrough in
terms of minority representation on television.</TE>
<TE>   "It may not have been the representation that we are seeking now,
but it certainly was a breakthrough to have a major character on
television that was not white, other than Desi [Arnaz in 'I Love
Lucy'].</TE>
<TE>   "The thing about the Pepino character is that although he was
constructed as a stereotype"--he called Brennan's Amos McCoy
character "Senor Grandpa," for example--"he was wise.</TE>
<TE>   "When there was conflict with the grandpa character or the Kate
and Luke characters, suddenly, out of nowhere, it was Pepino that
would say, 'Well, you know, Senor or Senora, why don't you do such
and such.' He was sort of the 'sleeper' resolver."</TE>
<TE>   Nolan said she and Martinez kept in touch over the decades, but
she hadn't seen him until the taping of a "Real McCoys" reunion
special two years ago for TNN, which was airing the series.</TE>
<TE>   "He looked terrific, and we were very happy to be there together,"
she said, adding that Martinez "was obviously very proud" of having
played Pepino on the show "and it was very much a part of his life."</TE>
<TE>   That was apparent when she later watched Martinez drive off in his
car, whose license plate read: PEPINO.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez, who wrote music for a handful of movies in Mexico in the
1970s, served as executive director of Artists Variety Co. in Puerto
Rico, a government-sponsored program to help citizens enter the
entertainment field, in the mid-1970s. He was executive director of
the Institute of Motion Pictures, the government film commission in
Puerto Rico, in the early 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, Martinez is survived by five children:
David of Las Vegas; Renee Wilson of Cedar City, Utah; Christian of
Los Angeles; Lessette of New York City; Kimra of Sedona, Ariz.; two

<HD>Peter Stroh, 74; Head of Brewery, Philanthropist</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Peter W. Stroh, who turned a family beer business into the country's
third-largest brewery and used his riches to redevelop blighted areas
of Detroit, died Tuesday of brain cancer at his home in Grosse Pointe
Farms, Mich. He was 74.</LD>
<LD>   Stroh headed the Stroh Brewery Co., founded in Detroit by his
German immigrant great-grandfather in 1850. It was known for its
Bohemian beer brewed in copper kettles.</LD>
<LD>   The fourth generation of his family to lead the company, Stroh
became a director in 1965 and chairman in 1982. He retired in 1997,
two years before a drastic downturn in beer consumption led to his
company's demise.</LD>
<TE>   Over the four decades of his involvement in the company, Stroh
became a civic activist and philanthropist who used his money to
expand opportunities for minorities and underprivileged groups. His
family also spent $150 million over the last two decades on
redevelopment projects, including a massive renovation of buildings
along Detroit's riverfront.</TE>
<TE>   "He never gave up on the city," former Mayor Dennis Archer told
the Detroit Free Press this week.</TE>
<TE>   Stroh, a Detroit native, did not intend to enter the family
business. He was educated at Princeton, earning a degree in
international affairs in 1951. His dream was to work for the Central
Intelligence Agency.</TE>
<TE>   He was recruited by the agency after graduating from college and
went to work in Washington while awaiting his security clearance.</TE>
<TE>   Three days after obtaining his clearance, he was hit by a runaway
truck that crushed his legs. He spent a year in the hospital
recovering and was told he might never walk again. He eventually
regained the ability to walk, though with a noticeable limp, but was
forced to abandon his plans for a career in intelligence work.</TE>
<TE>   He went to work at the brewery, immersing himself in the technical
aspects of production. He joined the board in 1955 and was named
director of operations in 1965.</TE>
<TE>   As president, he led a series of takeovers that would transform
the regional brewery into one of the nation's largest beer concerns.
When Stroh's bought out Milwaukee's Joseph Schlitz Brewing Co. in
1982, it became the nation's third-largest brewery, after Miller and
Anheuser-Busch.</TE>
<TE>   The company gained six breweries and entered burgeoning markets in
the South and West, but assumed an enormous debt in the process:
Stroh's had bought Schlitz by borrowing more than half of the
$494.7-million purchase price.</TE>
<TE>   The expansion came as the beer market was beginning to shrink.
Within a few years, Stroh's found it was producing far more beer--an
excess of 6 million barrels--than it could sell.</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, it shocked Detroit by announcing that it was closing its
71-year-old brewery, a city landmark where the company's flagship
brand, Stroh's, was made for 135 years.</TE>
<TE>   Stroh called the decision to close the plant "the most difficult
thing imaginable."</TE>
<TE>   He retired as chairman in 1997. In 1999, the family sold the rest
of the company to the Pabst and Miller brewing companies.</TE>
<TE>   After the fires of the 1967 Detroit riot, which Stroh watched from
the roof of the brewery, he plotted a strong course for his family in
the civic life of the city. He was active in the Urban League and the
Detroit chapter of the NAACP and quietly supported many charitable
efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Stroh family and corporate money was used to transform an old
pharmaceutical complex into Stroh River Place, a 26-acre commercial
and residential development along the Detroit River that has won
critical praise.</TE>
<TE>   Stroh is survived by his wife, the former Nicole Elisabeth
Fauquet-Lemaitre; two sons; a brother; and a grandchild.</TE>

<HD>Then Again, Who Put the Top Down?</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>GolfWorld reports that William Reese of West Dundee, Ill., is seeking
$50,000 in damages from the Golf Club in Algonquin, Ill., and its
former management company, American Golf Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Reese claims he suffered neurological problems after being hit in
the head by a golf ball while driving his car past the facility's
practice range.</LD>
<LD>   The magazine didn't report what kind of car he was driving. If it
was a convertible with the top down, he certainly was at risk.</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who was the first player from a Pacific 10 school to
be included among the top three in the Heisman Trophy voting?</TE>
<TE>   He's all riled up: Gary Shelton in the St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times
on the Tampa Bay Devil Rays losing 100 games for the second year in a
row:</TE>
<TE>   "A hundred losses! There should be a feeling of betrayal. It's an
outrageous number, and it should result in outrage. A hundred losses
should be a rare, horrifying experience. A hundred losses should
cancel all leaves, suspend all raises and shiver all timbers.</TE>
<TE>   "Here, we look the other way.... Frankly, it would be a healthy
thing to see a little anger, from the players, from the front office,
from the stands. It would be better to see impatient, impassioned
people demanding a little more than a team going gently into the good
night. It should matter."</TE>
<TE>   His heritage: Jon Saraceno in USA Today: "Six suspected Al Qaeda
sympathizers from the Buffalo suburb of Lackawanna probably think
they're receiving more national airtime than anyone ever for that
blue-collar town, but they would be wrong--ESPN's Ron Jaworski is a
native Lackawannian."</TE>
<TE>   Note: he's also a former L.A. Ram quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Brrr: Thirty-five years ago next New Year's Eve, the Green Bay
Packers defeated the Dallas Cowboys, 21-17, in the coldest NFL game
on record--the 1967 NFL title game, dubbed the "Ice Bowl."</TE>
<TE>   The official game-time temperature was 13 degrees below zero with
the windchill at minus-48.</TE>
<TE>   That's a real mess: After the Lions were routed, 31-7, by
36-year-old quarterback Rodney Peete and the sad-sack Carolina
Panthers, Mitch Albom of the Detroit Free Press wrote, "Two weeks
into the season, Detroit is as messed up as a 15-year-old's sock
drawer."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1934, St. Louis Cardinal ace Dizzy
Dean shut out Brooklyn on three hits in the first game of a
doubleheader, then brother Paul pitched a no-hitter against the
Dodgers in the second game.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back again: On this day in 1955, Rocky Marciano knocked
out Archie Moore in the ninth round at Yankee Stadium in New York to
retain the world heavyweight title.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Quarterback Frankie Albert of Stanford, third in
1941 behind Bruce Smith of Minnesota and Angelo Bertelli of Notre
Dame.</TE>
<TE>   Albert was also fourth in the voting in 1940.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Bob Sansevere of the St. Paul Pioneer Press,
commenting that Viking Coach Mike Tice hasn't felt the heat from fans
despite an 0-2 record:</TE>
<TE>   "However ... if the Vikings lose Sunday to the Carolina Panthers
and fall to 0-3, Tice will be about as popular in Minnesota as
mosquitoes. Actually, mosquitoes might hold a slight edge."</TE>

<HD>Against Steeler Defense, All Things Come to Pass</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The NFL is, and probably always will be, a copycat league. Whenever
something works for one team, you can count on another, or several
others, to switch to that something.</LD>
<LD>   That was the case Sunday night when the Oakland Raiders aired it
out in a 30-17 road victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers. Oakland
quarterback Rich Gannon set personal and team passing records with 43
completions in 64 attempts for 403 yards and a touchdown.</LD>
<LD>   All the Raiders did was follow the latest blueprint being handed
around the league, showing how to dissect the Steelers' once-feared
defense. It's a simple scheme that features a no-huddle attack and
multiple receivers. Most people make the mistake of lauding Super
Bowl champion New England for finding the cracks in Pittsburgh's pass
defense, but the real credit should go to the Cincinnati Bengals.</LD>
<TE>   The Bengals? Yes, the lowly Bengals.</TE>
<TE>   Late last season, Cincinnati ended a seven-game losing streak by
shocking the Steelers, 26-23, in overtime. The Bengals did it through
the air.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati Coach Dick LeBeau, a former Pittsburgh assistant,
devised a spread offense that exposed his former team, which gave up
411 yards passing and two touchdowns to Bengal quarterback Jon Kitna,
who will never be mistaken for Dan Marino.</TE>
<TE>   Kitna made it look easy against the NFL's No. 1 defense, ending
the Steelers' seven-game winning streak with an overtime touchdown
pass to former UCLA standout Danny Farmer.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately for the Steelers, there was only one game left in the
regular season and they did not see this attack again until the AFC
championship game against New England. And if the Patriots did not
copy the Bengals' entire game plan, they did use enough no-huddle
spread-formation plays to give Pittsburgh problems defensively.</TE>
<TE>   When New England played Pittsburgh again in their Monday night
season opener, the Patriots exploited the Steelers' secondary even
more as quarterback Tom Brady passed for 294 yards and three
touchdowns. He completed 29 of 43 passes, throwing 25 consecutive
times in one stretch.</TE>
<TE>   That set the stage for the Raiders and Gannon. With Gannon
throwing mostly to the veteran duo of Jerry Rice and Tim Brown, it's
a wonder he fell short of matching Drew Bledsoe's NFL record of 45
completions in a game.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland Coach Bill Callahan previously had told anyone who would
listen that the Raiders would pay no mind to the Patriots' passing
success against the Steelers and would try to run the ball. Yeah,
right. Callahan is as sharp as they come and he has never been afraid
to throw the ball, going back to his days as a record-setting
quarterback at Benedictine University, an NAIA school in Lisle, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Attacking the Steelers' stop-the-run-first defense was tailor-made
for the Raiders' ball-control passing offense. Callahan knew that he
had enough quick receivers who could get into patterns fast and beat
Pittsburgh's linebackers in the open field.</TE>
<TE>   The key was catching the Steelers in their basic 3-4 defense. That
was made easier by Pittsburgh Coach Bill Cowher, who figured that the
Raiders would run on first downs and refused to use extra defensive
backs.</TE>
<TE>   Once the Raiders got the matchups they wanted, they were able to
shift into passing formations without a huddle and that led to more
success for Gannon, who completed passes to nine receivers.</TE>
<TE>   Cowher's stubbornness is a major reason he's a successful coach.
His teams usually play with his tough-mindedness. But he blew it this
time by not having the right personnel on the field to stop the
Raiders. He continued to use his linebackers on the Raiders' swift
receivers. Big mistake.</TE>
<TE>   Gannon was at his best on third downs. The Raiders converted 12 of
20 third-down opportunities, 11 on completions by Gannon. Altogether,
he completed 13 of 17 third-down passes for 182 yards and a
touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Because none of Pittsburgh's cornerbacks were good enough to shut
down either Rice or Brown in man-to-man coverage, the Raiders
exploited the Steelers' combination zones. Gannon's strength is his
accuracy and he was able to find receivers who were open on short and
intermediate routes.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't take long for Pittsburgh defensive coordinator Tim Lewis
to realize that his unit was in trouble. After all, he had seen it
before. Three times, in fact.</TE>
<TE>   Once Gannon got hot, the Steelers blitzed more, but they could not
get to him quickly enough to disrupt his rhythm. The more blitzes
Lewis called, the more big plays the Raiders came up with. That's
going to be a problem all season for the Steelers unless players in
the secondary start playing better.</TE>
<TE>   "Guys that have to make plays need to step up and make plays when
they get an opportunity," Lewis said. "Teams are going to continue to
do the same thing until we put a stop to it."</TE>
<TE>   Will the Raiders continue to throw 65 passes a game? No way.
Expect Oakland to continue to feature a possession passing game, but
the Raiders understand that they have to be able to move the ball on
the ground, and they are stocked with capable running backs.</TE>
<TE>   Charlie Garner is capable of big rushing games. In Oakland's
season-opening victory over Seattle, for instance, he gained 127
yards in 15 carries. Throw in backups Tyrone Wheatley and Zack
Crockett, along with superb blocking back Jon Ritchie, and it's easy
to understand why the Raiders consider themselves a running team.</TE>
<TE>   Another plus for the Raiders' offense is the versatility of their
linemen. It's difficult for an offense to rush for 221 yards one
week, then pass for 403 yards the next, but the Raiders have done it.
And with guard Mo Collins due back soon after arthroscopic knee
surgery, the Raiders will be even stronger and deeper up front.</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders' passing game basically depends on the strengths and
weaknesses of the opposing team's defensive backs. Aside from Lee
Flowers, the Steelers lacked a hard-hitting safety to punish
Oakland's receivers.</TE>
<TE>   Brown and Rice are two of the best receivers in the history of the
NFL and their ability to create space away from defenders makes the
Raiders' small-ball offense click.</TE>
<TE>   Callahan, who had served as the Raiders' offensive coordinator for
four seasons before being promoted to head coach, loves to mix things
up. He helped coach the Raiders into the league's leading rushing
offense in 2000 and has the NFL's top-ranked passing offense this
season.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Gruden received most of the credit for the Raiders' success
the last few years, but, based on how poorly his Tampa Bay Buccaneers
have played offensively, Oakland's success speaks volumes about
Callahan's coaching abilities. He has put together one of the best
balanced offenses in football.</TE>

<HD>Simon Bears Dissonant Message, Observers Say</HD>
<DH>Politics: Gubernatorial candidate's adherence to Republican
dogma against big government is at odds with increased expectations
after 9/11, according to experts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Republican gubernatorial nominee Bill Simon Jr. campaigns to
unseat Gov. Gray Davis, he has been skeptical--and at times even
derisive--about what government can accomplish.</LD>
<LD>   In the fashion of a true-blue conservative, Simon has argued that
government should be doing less, not more. Want to make housing more
affordable? Loosen land-use restrictions. Hope to rejuvenate poor
neighborhoods? Eliminate the capital gains tax for companies that
invest in those communities. Need to build more dams, power
transmission lines and highways? Contract the projects out to private
companies.</LD>
<LD>   "California can be a state that stands for limited government and
unlimited opportunity, and not the other way around," he tells
audiences. In front of Republican audiences, the candidate often
blames bureaucrats in Sacramento and state regulations for strangling
the economy and school reform.</LD>
<TE>   Simon's message, which sticks closely to traditional Republican
orthodoxy, has surprised many political experts, who say it is
jarringly dissonant in the current climate. The terrorism attacks of
the last year, the recent string of corporate abuses and the failure
of California's energy deregulation have made voters increasingly
distrustful of big business and eager for more government protection,
according to pollsters.</TE>
<TE>   The message will strike many as out of step, said Carroll Doherty,
a political analyst at the Pew Research Center.</TE>
<TE>   "Government ratings skyrocketed after 9/11," Doherty said. "It has
come down a bit, but government is still doing better compared to
corporations and business."</TE>
<TE>   Simon is making his pitch at a time when antigovernment rhetoric
in national politics is at a nadir, analysts said. Other politicians
have pivoted to address the changed mood. President Bush, who
criticized Washington bureaucrats during the 2000 campaign, is
advocating new regulations for corporations and the creation of a
federal bureaucracy to combat terrorism. Unlike the 1994 election
cycle, when Republicans took control of Congress promising to scale
back government, conservative candidates this year are talking about
homeland security and corporate reform, efforts that suggest a larger
governmental role.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a cycle where generally across the country we're
seeing a lot of anti-politician and antigovernment rhetoric," said
Stu Rothenberg, a Washington-based political analyst. "Among
Republicans and conservatives, there's a sense that government has
more of a job right now to protect the country ... and that right
now, you need government."</TE>
<TE>   Simon said his philosophy about small government was influenced by
his father, the late Treasury Secretary William E. Simon, who was a
staunch believer in keeping bureaucracy in check. When Simon went to
work for the U.S. attorney's office in New York, he said, his father
warned him not to abuse the authority he would have.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen situations where the government has a lot of power, and
you've got to be very careful how you exercise that power," Simon
said. Otherwise, he added, "you get the sense that you're above
everything."</TE>
<TE>   Davis--a man who has spent almost all of his adult life in
government--epitomizes for Simon the ills of that approach. The
governor "takes a philosophy that the government knows better," Simon
said in a recent interview. "I have a reverse philosophy: I think our
people know better."</TE>
<TE>   Garry South, Davis' political strategist, dismissed the notion
that Davis is an ardent support of big government.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some things that government does well and has to do if
it's going to get done," South said. But "this governor has never
been one who has leaned to a government solution to every problem."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' Republican challenger has a more stark philosophy.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said that while he values the role of government in public
safety, he believes that state rules and agencies can be a roadblock
to economic growth, job creation and school reform--a view he
believes voters share, despite the terrorist attacks and corporate
scandals.</TE>
<TE>   "To the extent that people don't fear for their safety and to the
extent to which they don't feel they need to rely on the government,
I think they just want the government out of their lives," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And so on the campaign trail, Simon has stuck resolutely to his
call for limiting government and turning to the private sector for
solutions.</TE>
<TE>   "We all deserve opportunity, all of us, and we all deserve not to
be interfered with by our government," Simon told about 600 seniors
during a visit to Leisure World in Laguna Hills on Sept. 12.</TE>
<TE>   To partially close the state's massive budget gap, the GOP nominee
suggests cutting state operations by 15%. In his education plan,
Simon would dramatically reduce the number of state regulations and
decentralize school districts.</TE>
<TE>   In the past week, he said he would get "the state out of the power
business" to deal with California's energy crunch.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Simon said, he would transfer the state's power contracts
to local utilities and create incentives for private companies to
expand transmission lines.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes his message seems out of kilter with his environment.</TE>
<TE>   In July, the Republican nominee toured the Shasta Dam, the largest
man-made reservoir in California, a massive public works project that
took the federal government six years and almost 5,000 workers to
complete. But as he made his pitch about how he'd build more dams in
California, Simon's admiration for government projects faded.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's about time that we stop relying on our government,
and we start trying to limit the role of government and try to
empower our people," Simon said, adding that he would pursue private
partnerships to build more reservoirs.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't know that I've ever met a bureaucrat that I felt is
going to proactively address a problem," he added.</TE>

<HD>Latino Youths, Leaders Share Honors at Gala Spotlighting
Achievement</HD>
<DH>Tribute: A Carlsbad teenager's determination to attend
college despite many obstacles is cited by Washington-based Hispanic
Heritage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARIANNE ARYANPUR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Linda Chavira Moreno and her friends grew up idolizing distant stars
like pop-diva Jennifer Lopez and singing sensation Gloria Estefan.</LD>
<LD>   Nowadays, the kids in Moreno's neighborhood are looking up to her.</LD>
<LD>   The Carlsbad native was one of six Latino youths honored here
Friday at the Hispanic Heritage Awards, which recognize the positive
contributions of Latino role models.</LD>
<TE>   This fall, Moreno will become the first person in her family to
attend college when she begins her freshman year at UC San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since I was kid, I knew I was going to college," said
Moreno, 18, who hopes to become a geneticist. "My parents have been
encouraging me since I was a baby."</TE>
<TE>   After her father was incarcerated when she was 11, she said, she
had to watch her younger brother Martin, while her mother, Carmen
Chavira, worked two jobs to make ends meet.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Moreno managed to maintain a 4.0 grade-point average at San
Marcos High School in Carlsbad while competing as a star athlete in
sports, including volleyball and swimming.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Moreno says she hopes to overcome some of the negative
stereotypes that Latinos face, using education as her vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that you are even here, that you've graduated from high
school, is an achievement in itself," Jose Antonio Tijerino, the
group's executive director, told Moreno and the five other recipients
of the youth awards.</TE>
<TE>   According to the U.S. Department of Education, the high school
dropout rate for Latinos is 28%, compared with 7% for whites and 11%
for the overall population.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the fact that Latinos enter community college at higher
rates than the rest of the population, they are less likely than
those in other ethnic groups to get a four-year degree.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no greater inspiration to a young person than another
young person that succeeds in the classroom and community," Tijerino
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington-based nonprofit organization was established to
provide a greater understanding of Latinos' contributions to the
United States and to promote role models who inspire youths.</TE>
<TE>   The awards, which will be broadcast as an NBC television special
on Oct. 12, also honor five prominent members of the Latino
community.</TE>
<TE>   This year's honorees are best-selling novelist Julia Alvarez,
People en Espanol publisher Lisa Quiroz, internationally acclaimed
recording artist Ricky Martin, Mexican-American theologian Father
Virgilio Elizondo and 2002 Olympic speed skater Derek Parra.</TE>
<TE>   "My fellow Hispanic Heritage honorees are living proof that
Latinos are more capable of excellence in any field you can imagine,"
said Parra, a San Bernardino native who became the first Mexican
American to win a gold medal in the Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   The awards follow a series of recent events honoring the
achievements of Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Tom Daschle (D-S.D.)
and Rep. Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) met with Latino leaders in
Washington for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute's 25th
anniversary gala and Wednesday marked the third annual Latin Grammy
Awards, which were televised nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Although Moreno's father dropped out of the 10th grade and her
mother barely graduated from high school, her mother said she always
pushed her daughter to succeed.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to tell [Linda] when she was younger that she could do
what everyone else was doing, or she could go out and do what I never
did," said Chavira, who was 18 when she gave birth to Linda.</TE>
<TE>   "She's really lit a fire in some of her cousins now," Chavira
said. "They look up to her and see this is a girl they played with
and grew up with, and she is really making it; she is successful."</TE>

<HD>Davis Signs Bills for Housing Affordability</HD>
<DH>Legislation: The package is contingent on voter approval of
a $2.1-billion bond issue in November. Another bill should result in
more condos and townhouses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis signed a package of bills Friday aimed at addressing
California's acute shortage of affordable housing, depending on voter
approval in November of a $2.1-billion bond issue.</LD>
<LD>   Money from sale of the bonds would be spent on everything from
helping low-income Californians make down payments on homes to
rewarding local governments for building new housing to providing
$200 million for migrant farm worker shelters.</LD>
<LD>   Davis also signed a compromise bill (SB 800) that is expected to
stimulate construction of condominiums and townhouses by dramatically
reducing costly litigation that builders contend has discouraged such
construction.</LD>
<TE>   Under the new law, builders will be guaranteed the opportunity to
repair a defect before a lawsuit is filed against them. Also,
homeowners will be able to sue when a prospective defect threatens
the entire house.</TE>
<TE>   "In other words, they don't have to wait [to sue] until a roof
actually caves in," said Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg
(D-Sacramento). He helped negotiate the compromise bill among
builders, insurance companies and trial attorneys during the last two
years.</TE>
<TE>   Taken together, Davis said, the package will result in "new,
affordable housing being built all across the state. More families
will have the American dream of home ownership within their grasp."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the bills agreed that their program would help
remove barriers to construction of new housing, but they said the
details of producing the new housing will be a high priority issue
for next year's legislative session.</TE>
<TE>   Sunne McPeak, co-chairwoman of the Job-Center Housing Coalition,
which supported the bills, blamed the long-running housing crisis on
what she called regulatory and legal hurdles. Under the reform
program, she said, "We can turn the corner to supply the affordable
housing to meet the needs of our growing population and work force."</TE>
<TE>   Except for the construction defects bill, most other parts of the
package will depend on passage Nov. 5 of the record $2.1-billion
housing bond issue, introduced by Senate leader John L. Burton (D-San
Francisco).</TE>
<TE>   The largest chunk, $910 million, would be targeted for
deferred-payment loans to build permanent and transitional rental
units for lower-income families.</TE>
<TE>   Included also would be $15 million for student housing at campuses
of the University of California and the California State University
system.</TE>
<TE>   An additional $290 million would be earmarked for a program in
which first-time home buyers would get a so-called "silent" second
mortgage loan to reduce the principal and interest payments on the
original mortgage.</TE>
<TE>   The bills the governor signed were introduced by Sens. Joe Dunn
(D-Garden Grove) and Tom Torlakson (D-Antioch) and Assembly members
Dion Aroner (D-Berkeley), Manny Diaz (D-San Jose), Marco Firebaugh
(D-Los Angeles) and Alan Lowenthal (D-Long Beach).</TE>
<TE>   In other actions, Davis also signed:</TE>
<TE>   * Conservation--A bill (AB 2534) that allocates $300 million for
state and local clean air, land and water programs, including beach
cleanup. The funds came from Proposition 40, the $2.6-billion bond
issue approved by the voters in March.</TE>
<TE>   * Advise--A bill (AB 116) by Assemblyman George Nakano
(D-Torrance) that creates an Asian and Pacific Islander American
Affairs Commission to advise Davis and lawmakers on improving the
delivery of services to low-income and newly arrived immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   * Heart--A bill (AB 2041) by Assemblyman Juan Vargas (D-San Diego)
to expand immunity from liability to individuals who buy and use
automatic external defibrillators, an emergency device to resuscitate
heart attack victims. Exemption from immunity is intended to
encourage building owners to make this equipment available for use by
good Samaritans.</TE>
<TE>   * 311 calls--A bill (AB 669) by Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg
(D-Sherman Oaks) that authorizes local governments to install
nonemergency 311 systems as an alternative to overloaded 911
emergency lines.</TE>

<HD>Lawmaker Requests Probe Into Canceled Cleanup Order</HD>
<DH>Water: Attorney general is asked to investigate revoked
plans to treat well contamination in San Bernardino County. Board's
closed-door session is questioned.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>SAN BERNARDINO</DL>
<LD>Fueling accusations that Inland Empire officials are thwarting an
environmental cleanup, a state senator Friday asked the attorney
general to investigate a decision to cancel plans to treat chemical
pollution infiltrating local water supplies.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, state Sen. Nell Soto
(D-Ontario) criticized the Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control
Board for rescinding an order demanding that two companies linked to
a pollutant in Rialto clean it up.</LD>
<LD>   Worse, Soto wrote, the decision to throw out that order was made
behind closed doors.</LD>
<TE>   Critics are demanding a probe of whether the board violated
California's open-meeting law. And they want the cleanup order
reinstated immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Board officials conceded in interviews Friday that they did not
have to make the decision in secret, though they contend they were
legally allowed to do so.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general's office confirmed it had received the
request to investigate but had not yet prepared a response late
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Soto's demand for a probe follows allegations that San Bernardino
County officials are shirking their responsibility to provide clean
water--and hiding extensive knowledge of the pollution plume.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, members of a local pollution task force said a
plume of perchlorate in northern Rialto has infiltrated so many wells
that it could threaten the local water supply.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Groveman, chairman of the Inland Empire Perchlorate Task
Force, accused San Bernardino County of exacerbating the problem by
burying a polluted site while expanding a landfill. The county denies
blame for the pollution.</TE>
<TE>   Then, last week, Arrowhead Regional Medical Center acknowledged
that perchlorate, a compound used to make rocket fuel and munitions,
had contaminated its well. Hospital officials said they had known of
the contamination for at least two weeks but had not told the public
or county officials because they were waiting to conduct more tests.</TE>
<TE>   Arrowhead has since begun taking water from a clean line provided
by the city of Colton, said Eric Fraser, Colton's director of water
and wastewater.</TE>
<TE>   Soto's letter to the attorney general says investigators have
shown that numerous government agencies have known about the
pollution for at least five years.</TE>
<TE>   In the process, Groveman said, the agencies are disregarding the
interests of the public.</TE>
<TE>   "If you push an ineffective bureaucracy hard, they tend to push
back," Groveman said. "We just have to make sure that we are pushing
harder than they are pushing back. This is not the way to conduct the
public's business."</TE>
<TE>   Perchlorate, known to cause ailments including thyroid problems
and, potentially, cancer, is particularly dangerous to pregnant
women, according to federal environmental authorities.</TE>
<TE>   County officials believe a plume of perchlorate was introduced
into the groundwater by a slew of Cold War-era ammunition, munitions
and ordnance manufacturing operations working under U.S. Department
of Defense contracts.</TE>
<TE>   So far, 17 wells in San Bernardino County have been shut down
because of perchlorate pollution--and Soto said investigators believe
as many 40 more wells may be polluted. Those wells supply water to a
number of communities, including Rialto and Colton.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the task force say two manufacturing operations are
largely to blame for the pollution.</TE>
<TE>   From 1957 to 1964, according to an affidavit, Goodrich Corp. owned
and operated a 160-acre site north of Rialto where it researched and
made military ordnance, including solid rocket propellants.
Perchlorate was used in those manufacturing operations, Goodrich
attorney Craig Moyer acknowledged Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Also in the 1950s, West Coast Loading Corp. used a nearby site to
manufacture flares for pistols and parachutes, state regulators and
task force members have said.</TE>
<TE>   In June, the board ordered the two companies to study and clean up
the contamination. The companies were given a chance to appeal, which
they did, bringing them before the board last week. Representatives
for both companies argued there is no evidence that they discharged
perchlorate into the groundwater.</TE>
<TE>   After hearing arguments, the board went behind closed doors and
rescinded the cleanup orders. Instead, the board said it would issue
"investigative" letters to about 20 companies in a broader probe to
determine contamination sources.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to be broadening this investigation as quickly as
possible," said Jerald Thibeault, the board's executive officer.</TE>
<TE>   Thibeault also defended the board's closed-door meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "That's just our standard approach," he said. "You don't just do
this stuff willy-nilly. You're talking hundreds of millions of
dollars here."</TE>
<TE>   Soto said it could take months, even years, before a probe
actually leads to a cleanup.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a very serious problem here," she said. "These agencies
are responsible to the people in my district."</TE>

<LD>The City Council will decide Tuesday whether to pay nearly $7 million
for the Grove of Anaheim, a 1,100-seat theater in the community's
sports and entertainment district.</LD>
<LD>   City officials are planning to turn over management of the Grove
to a private entertainment company. The city, however, would hold on
to the prime real estate between Edison International Field and
Arrowhead Pond for future development.</LD>
<LD>   Anaheim originally owned the 1.25-acre site, but deeded it to
Ogden Entertainment in 1997 for $1 million on condition that the
company build a dinner theater and give the city first rights if it
ever tried to sell it.</LD>

<HD>Charges of Police Sleeping on Duty Probed in Anaheim</HD>
<DH>Law enforcement: Four have been placed on leave as the
department checks the allegations. Their colleagues have dubbed them
the 'Graveyard Dream Team.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anaheim police have placed four officers on administrative leave as
they investigate allegations that the four repeatedly slept on the
job during graveyard shifts.</LD>
<LD>   The officers were found sleeping in their police cars when they
should have been on patrol, according to several law enforcement
sources familiar with the investigation.</LD>
<LD>   Sgt. Rick Martinez, chief spokesman for the 390-officer
department, declined to comment. "We never talk about personnel
investigations," he said.</LD>
<TE>   But several sources said the officers are being investigated for a
pattern of on-duty sleeping and also for possibly misleading
supervisors in an effort to cover up their behavior. The probe began
about three months ago, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Rumors about the alleged on-duty sleeping have been rampant in the
department, with some colleagues dubbing them the ''Graveyard Dream
Team,'' sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Sleeping on duty is considered a serious violation, but the
discipline it merits is widely varied, police officials said. Los
Angeles police, for example, suspended Officer Bama Steven Ford for
40 days in 1996 after determining that he slept on duty on two
occasions and made misleading statements to an investigator,
according to LAPD police records.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear whether the officers were reported by a member of the
public or by someone within the department.</TE>
<TE>   Police officials on Friday said they could make available the
department's policy on sleeping on duty or provide a list of officers
who are currently on administrative leave.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Palmer, president of the Anaheim Police Assn., which
represents officers in discipline hearings, also declined to discuss
the investigation. Departments nationwide have been dealing with
officers who sleep on the job--especially late-night and
early-morning shifts when call volume is low.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore's police chief launched a crackdown last year that
nabbed more than a dozen officers for sleeping on duty. The
stings--led by internal affairs officers--resulted in several firings
and other disciplinary action.</TE>

<HD>Oxnard Neighbors Smell Trouble</HD>
<DH>Sanitation: Plans to open an idled waste treatment plant
run afoul of residents already living near facilities that give off
strong odors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With neighbors that include two sewage plants, a mushroom farm and a
wood-recycling plant, folks in the South Bank area of north Oxnard
have endured nauseating smells for years.</LD>
<LD>   So when the Ventura Regional Sanitation District closed one of two
nearby waste treatment facilities in July, residents literally
breathed more easily.</LD>
<LD>   But now the Montalvo Municipal Improvement District, which owns
the property with the treatment facilities, plans to process an
increased amount of waste from the idled system.</LD>
<TE>   Oxnard residents and officials would prefer the entire Montalvo
site be totally shut down and its pipes connected directly to the
Ventura sewer system.</TE>
<TE>   Despite assurances that Montalvo's treatment facilities would not
run any waste through Oxnard pipes or handle any restaurant oils and
greases, nor human wastes, residents of the neighborhood south of the
Santa Clara River are wary the foul smells will return.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still going to be the same problem," said Travis Childress,
a South Bank resident.</TE>
<TE>   For years Childress and his neighbors had complained of a rotten
odor permeating South Bank.</TE>
<TE>   At any given time, they said, their streets can smell like rotten
eggs, grass or worse. Childress said he once had to cancel a barbecue
because the stench was intolerable.</TE>
<TE>   "These are smells that will wake you up from the dead," resident
Bert Perello said. "I guarantee you if the winds blew through
downtown Ventura and they were getting these smells, something
would've been done."</TE>
<TE>   At Tuesday's Oxnard City Council meeting, city officials
recommended the city oppose even a scaled-down version of the waste
treatment facility.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no provisions for odor control or containment," said
Mark Norris, the city's waste-water superintendent.</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura Regional Sanitation District has postponed a search
for another site for a liquid waste treatment facility. It had
considered plans to use the plant to receive some of the Saticoy
district's waste, but has not made a decision, sanitation district
Chairman David Bury said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're waiting to take future action based on the results of an
odor study," Bury said.</TE>
<TE>   Bury said the sanitation district had planned to close the
facility next year, but that complaints from area residents forced
them to move more quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the smell was traced to a pipe that carried partly treated
waste from the district's waste treatment facility in Montalvo to
Oxnard's sewage system.</TE>
<TE>   Sewer pipes in north Oxnard, which serve mostly residences, are
too small to also handle the extra waste from the Liquid Waste
Treatment Facility. So that waste was moved at night when household
use was at a minimum.</TE>
<TE>   This, in turn, caused smelly liquid waste to sit all day inside
the pipeline and produce gases such as hydrogen sulfide, which can
cause eye irritation, sore throats and coughing, shortness of breath,
headaches, memory loss, or even death under high levels of exposure.</TE>

<HD>Probe Focuses on Slain Prosecutor's Relationship With a
Drug Abuser</HD>
<DH>Murder: Intervention by Stephen Tauzer in the young man's
court case, allowing him to live at his residence, and other actions
lead authorities to refocus investigation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adding to the mystery surrounding the death of Kern County's No. 2
prosecutor, high-ranking legal authorities said Friday they were
perplexed and troubled by the relationship between the veteran
prosecutor and a young drug abuser.</LD>
<LD>   According to Deputy Atty. Gen. Leah Ann Alcazar, Assistant Dist.
Atty. Stephen M. Tauzer inserted himself into the drug case against
Lance Hillis and refused to withdraw even after the case was turned
over to the attorney general's office. The state prosecutor said
Tauzer even helped the younger man violate probation by taking him
out of the county without first obtaining permission from the
probation department.</LD>
<LD>   The relationship between the avuncular, white-haired Tauzer, 57,
and Hillis, 22, has not only raised issues of favoritism and cronyism
in Kern County's tightly knit law enforcement community, it has
become a focus of the investigation into the prosecutor's murder.</LD>
<TE>   Tauzer was found in a pool of blood in his garage last Sunday. The
coroner's office has released scant details, saying only that Tauzer
was stabbed at least once in the head and suffered other head trauma.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, speculation about who might have a motive in this oil
patch town centered on the cases Tauzer had tried over his 30-year
career, including high-profile murders and political corruption cases
in surrounding communities.</TE>
<TE>   But Tauzer's relationship with the deeply troubled Hillis, who
himself was killed in a traffic accident last month, has come under
increasing scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   Hillis had drifted from an all-American childhood as the son and
grandson of Bakersfield law enforcement officers into drugs and
crime. He was taken in by Tauzer, who allowed the young man to live
in his northwest Bakersfield home, providing him money and a car to
drive.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzer told court officials he'd known the boy since he was 5, and
was determined to help him kick his drug habit.</TE>
<TE>   This brought him into conflict with Hillis' father, Chris, a
former district attorney's investigator who believed in a tough-love
approach. Chris Hillis felt Lance needed to hit bottom to get better;
and hitting bottom meant going to jail.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Hillis and the prosecutor had once been friends, but
came to blows in the months before Tauzer's death over Tauzer's
continuing interference.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Hillis denies having anything to do with the murder, saying
in an interview he turned all his anger toward Tauzer "over to God."</TE>
<TE>   But investigators have reportedly continued to look at Tauzer's
involvement with the younger Hillis. They flew to Northern California
this week to question the operators of a drug treatment center in
Placerville, where Lance Hillis had been a resident.</TE>
<TE>   One source close to the investigation said detectives are
considering the possibility that the younger Hillis might have
bragged about his relationship with the powerful and financially
well-off Tauzer. They wonder whether someone who heard such stories
could have been motivated to attack the prosecutor. A spokesman for
the center, Progress House, declined to comment Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Kern County Dist. Atty. Ed Jagels, a friend of Tauzer's for 27
years, has said his colleague's relationship with Hillis was open and
above board. But Alcazar, the state prosecutor who took the young
man's case, said Friday that she was bothered by it. "I'm on record
saying [Tauzer's] involvement was inappropriate," she said.</TE>
<TE>   According to Alcazar, Hillis had flunked out of so many treatment
programs that she was in agreement with Hillis' family that he would
benefit from jail time on a recent arrest for methamphetamine
possession.</TE>
<TE>   The county probation department also urged jail time. Yet,
according to Alcazar, Tauzer wrote letters and appeared in court on
behalf of Hillis.</TE>
<TE>   Alcazar also said Superior Court Judge Lee Felice, who handled the
case, directed questions to Tauzer instead of her, even though she
was prosecuting the case.</TE>
<TE>   Although Hillis was out of treatment options under state law that
governs drug offenders, Judge Felice gave him another opportunity,
Alcazar said. Efforts to reach Felice on Friday were unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   As to the charge that Tauzer helped Hillis violate probation by
taking him out of the county, Chief Probation Officer Larry Rhoades
called it "a technical violation."</TE>
<TE>   "Any violation of probation is serious," he said. "But once we
verified [Hillis] was being placed in a licensed program, we saw
nothing to be gained" by adding new charges for the probation
violation.</TE>
<TE>   Even though he took no action against Tauzer or Hillis, Rhoades
said people in his department were bothered by Tauzer's actions.</TE>
<TE>   "This department did have concerns about Mr. Tauzer's involvement
in the case," Rhoades said.</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A tiger being exhibited at a private school in Scotts Valley suddenly
sprang into a seating area and bit a 6-year-old student in the head
Friday, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The unidentified boy was airlifted to Stanford Medical Center,
where he was treated for a gash on his scalp and held overnight for
observation.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said the tiger and other animals had been taken to the
auditorium at Baymonte Christian School in Scotts Valley, near Santa
Cruz, as a reward for students who had sold magazine subscriptions.</LD>
<TE>   The year-old tiger, which was on a leash, leaped at the boy as the
animal's handler was leading it out of the auditorium, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The handler and the school's principal, Steve Patterson,
immediately pulled the animal off the boy, Scotts Valley Police Capt.
Harry Bidleman said.</TE>

<HD>Coliseum in Lead, but Can It Finish?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ever since the NFL season started, I've been wondering what happened
to the most significant million dollars in Los Angeles sports
history.</LD>
<LD>   Talk about money making an impact. When the Coliseum Commission
simply announced in June that it was going to spend up to $1 million
to pursue the return of an NFL team, it was enough to send the
Anschutz Entertainment Group running for the hills with its stadium
proposal .</LD>
<LD>   Since the Coliseum Commission is a semi-or quasi-or pseudo-public
entity, then--to paraphrase Jeff Spicoli in "Fast Times at Ridgemont
High"--doesn't that make it our money?</LD>
<TE>   First of all, General Manager Pat Lynch said, the money comes from
the Coliseum's funds, not the public's. Among the sources of income
are the $10,000 daily rental fees it draws for film shoots.</TE>
<TE>   You can recognize the Coliseum as the backdrop to just about every
outdoor stadium in the commercials. Pauly Shore wishes he could get
that much work.</TE>
<TE>   So what are they spending the loot on?</TE>
<TE>   The mundane stuff. The groundwork.</TE>
<TE>   They've hired UBS Paine Webber in New York to do financial
projections. They've hired a consultant to estimate construction
costs.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're trying to do is totally cook our product and make sure
it's done," Lynch said.</TE>
<TE>   In their most public display so far, Coliseum Commission members
took a trip this week to Chicago to see the renovation of Soldier
Field. They like to talk about the similarities between that stadium
and the Coliseum--the clustering of museums on the "campus" area, the
historical landmark status, the various political bodies that govern
the venue.</TE>
<TE>   It took more than a decade to get the go-ahead to bring Soldier
Field into the NFL's modern era. Among the plans discussed during
that time were a dome next door at the McCormick convention center
and even relocating to the grimy city of Gary, Ind. Eventually, the
Bears and the city worked out a way to keep the team in the same
place it has called home for the last three decades.</TE>
<TE>   But there's one compelling element to Soldier Field that made it
such a desirable location: it is adjacent to the shores of Lake
Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   "The lake is beautiful," Lynch said, a little enviously. "We've
got the freeways."</TE>
<TE>   The Coliseum has more than its landlocked location working against
it.</TE>
<TE>   "Governance issues," Lynch said. "Perceptions."</TE>
<TE>   The problems with the Coliseum lie more in people's heads than on
the stadium ground. The unimaginative owners of the NFL can't get the
images of raucous Raider games in a suite-less stadium out of their
heads and constantly dismiss the Coliseum as an option. With the
city, county and state controlling parts of the Commission, it will
always be difficult to get them all in agreement. As one prominent
local sports attorney said, "The biggest problem is internal."</TE>
<TE>   Despite everything working against it, the Coliseum won't simply
go away. It's the sad-eyed puppy in the dog pound that you can't
ignore.</TE>
<TE>   "We just persevere," Lynch said. "We think we've got the best
deal.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe we've got the cleanest, quickest way to get this deal
done in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have to acquire the land, we already own it. Don't have
to get clearance to build, we've already got the stadium."</TE>
<TE>   They propose a $400-million renovation. One way in which it would
differ from the Soldier Field reconstruction is that it would
preserve the view of the distinctive architectural features. Soldier
Field's famed columns will no longer be visible from the interior of
the stadium; the Coliseum's peristyle would still stand out.</TE>
<TE>   There are only two small things the Coliseum is missing: money and
a team.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the biggest problem," Lynch said. "It's almost like a
chicken-and-egg thing. You need a franchise to get the deal done, but
you need to entice the franchise. What we have to show them is that
they will do so much better in the new stadium."</TE>
<TE>   One person close to the Coliseum project said this would be easier
than the unsuccessful attempt to land an expansion franchise three
years ago because you could deal directly with an existing team,
instead of the league. (Even though NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue
said this week that the league wouldn't rule out creating a 33rd
franchise especially for L.A., I wouldn't count on it. They'll say
anything to maintain the appearance that Los Angeles is in play). But
an NFL-backed G3 loan would be an essential part of the package to
lure any team here.</TE>
<TE>   So it's back to dealing with the same old owners. The owners who
are saying "told you so" to the Anschutz group, which thought it
could make a bid without interference from the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   The Coliseum and the Rose Bowl keep tossing their hats into the
ring because they're fighting for survival. A new NFL stadium would
doom one or both of the older venues. There simply aren't enough
large stadium events around to support three buildings.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl has signed up consultant John Moag, with the NFL's
blessing.</TE>
<TE>   But they're at Square 1. With the Anschutz Entertainment Group
dropping out of the race, the Coliseum is in the lead.</TE>
<TE>   "You saw what they're doing in Chicago," Lynch said. "It would
take us to drag every Angeleno there to understand that, but that's
what we're talking about."</TE>
<TE>   That would cost a lot more than $1 million. Unless Southwest
Airlines still has that Friends Fly Free program.</TE>

<HD>Study Says Coaches Should Go for It</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Imagine you're a football coach. It's early in the first half, and
your offense has fourth and two at the opponent's 10-yard line. What
do you do? You kick the field goal, of course.</LD>
<LD>   But not if David Romer has anything to say about it.</LD>
<LD>   Romer, a University of California economics professor, has devised
a statistical formula that suggests it makes more sense to go for it
on fourth down--from nearly any spot on the field--than it does to
punt or kick a field goal.</LD>
<TE>   He and five research assistants examined 20,000 first-quarter
plays from 732 NFL games from 1998 through 2000, laying the
groundwork for a 33-page working paper titled "It's Fourth Down and
What Does the Bellman Equation Say? A Dynamic Programming Analysis of
Football Strategy."</TE>
<TE>   Romer concludes that teams should gamble more often, even take
risks that traditional football thinkers would consider insane. But,
of the 1,100 fourth downs on which Romer thought it best to go for
it, teams kicked 992 times.</TE>
<TE>   "Risks have upsides and downsides," Romer said. "For some reason,
coaches seem to emphasize the downside."</TE>
<TE>   Through two weeks, NFL teams are 27 for 49 when going for it on
fourth down. Seattle has tried it the most, having converted two of
five. Jacksonville is four for four; Minnesota three for three, and
St. Louis 0 for 2, having failed on pivotal fourth-down attempts in
losses to Denver and the New York Giants.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, teams gambled on fourth down roughly once a game.
Detroit did it the most, 25 times, whereas San Diego logged a
league-low four attempts--all of which the Chargers converted.</TE>
<TE>   According to the study, teams going for it on fourth-and-short
near the goal line are successful only 43% of the time. Romer has
determined, though, that the difference between a touchdown and a
field goal makes it worth the risk.</TE>
<TE>   He's still looking for an NFL coach who agrees.</TE>
<TE>   "I appreciate those kinds of studies by people who are really
interested and have incredible intellect," said Bill Walsh, who
coached the 49ers to three Super Bowl victories. "But they're in a
'Star Wars' mode, and we're down to the practicality of performing
under tremendous stress.</TE>
<TE>   "If you tried to transfer that [fourth-down theory] to warfare, an
entire army would be annihilated in a matter of three to four
months."</TE>
<TE>   Walsh said there are factors that the numbers simply don't take
into account, such as injuries, crowd noise and momentum.</TE>
<TE>   "Another factor is your defense," he said. "If you have the
Steeler defense of the '70s, or the 49er defense of the '80s, you
feel a lot better when you go for it and don't make it."</TE>
<TE>   Romer's paper first attracted attention this summer, when he
submitted it to the National Bureau of Economic Strategy, and he's
delighted NFL luminaries such as Walsh have taken a look. Still, the
professor has grown weary of the response he has heard from coaches
time and again: You're tenured, I'm not.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Funny that tight end Christian Fauria now plays for the Patriots.
Last season, in the week leading up to the Super Bowl, he didn't
think New England had a prayer against the Rams.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in Hawaii with my wife's family and my father-in-law was
taking bets on the game," said Fauria, the Encino Crespi High
graduate who spent his first seven seasons with the Seahawks. "He
thought the Patriots were going to win, straight up. I was thinking,
'You're a fool. They're going to get killed. You're a sucker.'</TE>
<TE>   "But I changed my mind when the Patriots came out and they were
introduced as a team, not as individuals. At that minute, right then
and there, I was like, 'They're going to win the game.' They showed
so much unity and brotherhood, they were going to win on heart
alone."</TE>
<TE>   As we all know, the Patriots won, 20-17.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Tailgate Russ" wanted a party. He got only the hangover.</TE>
<TE>   Russell Stevenson, a devoted Eagle fan, planned a 1,000-person
tailgate party before Sunday's game against Dallas, a bash complete
with six chefs, a rock band, a disc jockey, 35 kegs of beer, a clown,
jugglers, even a world-champion sand sculptor. He rented a 60-inch TV
and furniture to set up an impromptu living room.</TE>
<TE>   Well, the city's Department of Licenses and Inspections nixed the
party after Stevenson--who planned to charge admission--talked about
his plans on the radio.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just shellshocked," Stevenson told Philadelphia Inquirer
columnist Michael Vitez. "I haven't slept. My stomach's in knots."</TE>
<TE>   Sounds as if he could use a back rub. Good thing he retained Trisa
the masseuse and her four girlfriend masseuses for the party too.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The expansion Houston Texans are 1-1, meaning they have a better
record than the Rams, Seahawks, Steelers and Ravens--all playoff
teams last season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In a conference call with Houston writers this week, Colt
quarterback Peyton Manning asked them to remind Texan center Steve
McKinney about "stamps."</TE>
<TE>   After some cajoling, an embarrassed McKinney confessed he used to
"stamp" his former Indianapolis teammates by emerging from the
showers and startling them by pressing his wet bottom against their
dry skin. He has continued the practice in Houston, and one of his
recent victims was reserve quarterback Mike Quinn.</TE>
<TE>   "That dude has got some serious issues," a flustered Quinn told
reporters. "That says a lot about a guy, doing that sort of thing. I
just try to stay away from him and keep my eyes open when he's
around."</TE>
<TE>   Kind of makes you wonder about stamp collectors.</TE>

<HD>George's Status Still Uncertain</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tennessee Titan running back Eddie George returned to practice Friday
but still is unsure whether he will play against the Cleveland Browns
on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   George's left foot swelled considerably after the Titans' 21-13
loss to Dallas last week. He went to a hospital, wore an orthopedic
boot early this week and missed two days of practice.</LD>
<LD>   "It's just gotten a lot better, but I still think it's going to be
a game-time decision," George said Friday. "We'll see how it
responds, but it feels a lot better than it did two days ago."</LD>
<TE>   George is listed as questionable on the official league injury
report for Sunday's game, as are quarterback Steve McNair, middle
linebacker Randall Godfrey, starting left cornerback Andre Dyson and
backup tight end Shad Meier.</TE>
<TE>   All have practiced this week to some degree, and McNair said he
intends to start.</TE>
<TE>   George has started all 98 games of his career, the third-longest
streak for a running back in NFL history. Walter Payton started the
first 170 of his career, and Ricky Watters the first 114.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland Coach Butch Davis chose captains for Sunday's game
against Tennessee and one of them is quarterback Tim Couch.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland's coach isn't quite ready to publicly announce if Couch
is starting, however.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't know yet," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Couch missed the first two games with a sore right elbow, but
after spending the majority of the week practicing with the
first-team offense, he probably will start against the Titans.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Holcomb is expected to return to his role as backup after
starting against Kansas City and Cincinnati while Couch rested his
arm. Holcomb was superb filling in for Couch, completing 44 of 69
passes for 526 yards with five touchdowns and no interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Seattle Seahawks activated offensive tackle Walter Jones and
released guard Konrad Dean. Coach Mike Holmgren said Jones will start
Sunday against the New York Giants.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, a two-time Pro Bowl selection, signed a one-year,
$4.92-million deal Monday after missing training camp and the first
two regular-season games because of a contract dispute. Holmgren said
he wasn't sure how long Jones could play since he practiced for only
one week.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cornerback Quentin Jammer, the fifth overall pick in April's
draft, was activated by the San Diego Chargers. Jammer was expected
to play as a nickel back and on special teams when the Chargers (2-0)
visit the Arizona Cardinals (1-1) on Sunday.... Carolina Panther
kicker John Kasay had hernia surgery and will be out six to eight
weeks. Team spokesman Charlie Dayton said the Panthers will determine
today if they will put Kasay on injured reserve, which would mean he
would be out for the season.</TE>

10    MIAMI  (2-0)          Ricky Williams is looking pretty

                            victory. (13)
13    SAN DIEGO (2-0)       Should be 3-0 when Patriots come to town.
                            (20)
14    PITTSBURGH  (0-2)     Pass defense has been lousy. ( 7)
15    BUFFALO  (1-1)        Overtime was kinder to Bills last
                            weekend. (17)
16    TENNESSEE  (1-1)      Steve McNair coming off a minor
                            concussion. (14)
17    CLEVELAND  (1-1)      Defense had three interceptions, five
                            sacks vs. hapless Bengals. (19)
18    N.Y. JETS  (1-1)      Didn't put up a fight against New
                            England. (16)
19    INDIANAPOLIS  (1-1)   Peyton Manning: three interceptions in
                            first half vs. Dolphins. (18)
20    JACKSONVILLE (1-1)    Fred Taylor is very effective when he's
                            sound. (23)
21    MINNESOTA (0-2)       Daunte Culpepper looked sharp in loss to
                            Buffalo. (24)
22    ATLANTA  (0-2)        Another razor-close loss for a fragile
                            team. (22)
23    KANSAS CITY  (1-1)    Defense has surrendered 400-plus yards in
                            consecutive games. (21)
24    CAROLINA  (2-0)       Two victories, but consider the
                            competition--Ravens and Lions. (26)
25    ARIZONA  (1-1)        Thomas Jones ran all over Seahawks. (25)
26    WASHINGTON  (1-1)     Spurrier's offense wasn't special at all
                            Monday night. (15)
27    SEATTLE  (0-2)        Run defense? What run defense? (27)
28    DALLAS (1-1)          Quincy Carter was a new man against
                            Tennessee. (32)
29    HOUSTON  (1-1)        David Carr is green--and black &amp; blue.
                            (28)
30    BALTIMORE (0-2)       The Ravens have nothing when it comes to
                            their ground game. (30)
31    CINCINNATI  (0-2)     Bengals have been outscored, 54-13. (31)
32    DETROIT (0-2)         Lions certainly don't want to see the
                            Packers this weekend. (29)</TE>

<HD>Gypsy Look's Demise Could Pose Headaches for Retailers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The bohemian look, rooted in the gypsy lifestyle, appears to be
moving on.</LD>
<LD>   The style, whose soft, flouncing skirts and scooped-neck blouses
with bell-shaped sleeves have had cash registers ringing since early
last year, is waning.</LD>
<LD>   Bohemian's demise would be a big blow for a wide range of fashion
retailers--from discounters to specialty shops to department
stores--that, starved for a new trend, invested heavily in the style.
On Friday, Wachovia Securities apparel analyst Joseph Teklits said in
a report that the look appears to have hit "a brick wall."</LD>
<TE>   Apparel manufacturers also could feel the sting because they often
share in the loss if retailers must slash prices to sell products.</TE>
<TE>   Capping a weak back-to-school selling season, merchants are
complaining of sluggish sales this month, partly because the look is
losing steam and there's nothing to replace it, Teklits said.</TE>
<TE>   Retailers that cater to trendy young female shoppers are feeling
the pinch. San Diego-based Charlotte Russe Holding Inc., a 240-store
clothing chain that caters to teens and young women, lowered its
quarterly profit expectations Thursday, citing slower back-to-school
business. Its stock plunged 18%, but rebounded slightly Friday,
gaining 26 cents, to $11.30, in Nasdaq trading.</TE>
<TE>   Competitors Bebe and Wet Seal Inc. also are seeing year-over-year
sales declines and American Eagle Outfitter's bohemian-inspired fall
line for women "will be a tough sell," Teklits said.</TE>
<TE>   Abbey Landers, a 21-year-old UCLA student shopping Friday at South
Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, won't be buying any more of the stuff.
"The rumor is it's going to go out of fashion, so why buy it?" said
Landers, who was wearing vintage hip-hugger jeans and a red
scoop-necked top.</TE>
<TE>   Many retailers would be hurt by a cooling of the trend because
they stocked up on the style, said Marshal Cohen, co-president of NPD
FashionWorld, a division of NPD Group, a market research company in
New York.</TE>
<TE>   "More than ever before, there are so few trends that, when one
emerges, everybody jumps on the bandwagon," he said. The only other
must-have item for shoppers has been jeans, but that is less risky
because jeans are a staple.</TE>
<TE>   "The bohemian look is a trend that's in and out like a flash,"
Cohen said. "But retailers have reacted to it like it's a
[longer-term] lifestyle change, and that's not the case."</TE>
<TE>   Retailers, saddled with cautious consumers and a temperamental
economy, don't need more headaches heading into the holiday season. A
demise of the bohemian look would be especially painful because the
sale of young women's fashions has been one of the few bright spots
in apparel retailing over the last year, Teklits said.</TE>
<TE>   The style emerged in early 2001, steadily gained steam and peaked
this spring. By then, peasant-style blouses were selling at discount
stores for $18 and at pricey department stores for $68, Cohen said.</TE>
<TE>   The trend gave discounters and specialty stores another leg up on
department stores, because young women were shelling out money for a
look, not a brand, Cohen said. It also highlighted one way the
fashion world has changed, with lower-priced stores latching on to
trends earlier and even helping to define them.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, the most expensive designers and the lowest-priced
retailers are getting a lot of information from the same sources,"
traveling to Europe, using similar style forecasting companies and
subscribing to the same trend reports, Cohen said. The upshot: "The
consumer is exposed today to very similar trends at all different
prices."</TE>
<TE>   Wet Seal, the girls' and young women's apparel chain, jumped on
the trend early. The Foothill Ranch put the style in its shops,
including its teen-oriented Arden B stores and Zutopia for younger
girls. By early August, Arden B had begun replacing bohemian with a
"simpler, cleaner" fashion. Customers were "more ready for the change
than we had anticipated," Chief Executive Kathy Bronstein said in
August.</TE>
<TE>   Although the look initially targeted the under 35-crowd, versions
of the bohemian look "trickled up" to older women as retailers that
sell to different age groups jumped on the trend, said Sara Scheuer,
spokeswoman for the National Retail Federation in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   But the look isn't an easy sell for the professional woman who is
closely guarding her clothing budget and doesn't want to look like
she "just stepped out of a VW bus on the way to a concert," Scheuer
said.</TE>
<TE>   Some elements of the bohemian style--a frilly blouse paired with a
denim blazer--probably will carry forward as designers find ways to
blend the look with the basic, conservative styles that are
resurfacing, Scheuer said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what's going to sell is the stuff that's got some
crossover appeal," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Women's Wear Daily, the bible of the women's apparel industry,
recently featured more revealing versions of the look--see-through
fabrics and shoulder-baring sleeves.</TE>

<HD>Honda Extends Warranty on 1.2 Million Vehicles</HD>

<LD>Moving quickly to satisfy Honda and Acura owners worried about
transmission failures in their cars and minivans, American Honda
Motor Co. said Friday that it would extend the transmission
warranties on 1.2 million vehicles to seven years or 100,000 miles
from the date of purchase.</LD>
<LD>   The move comes after The Times reported Sept. 11 that the company,
a unit of Honda Motor Co. of Japan, had replaced almost 16,000
four-and five-speed automatic transmissions during the last three
years. Owners of the affected vehicles had complained of erratic
shifting and in some cases spontaneous downshifting into low gears at
highway speeds--a situation some owners said caused them to lose
control of their cars.</LD>
<LD>   Mike Spencer, a spokesman for Torrance-based American Honda, said
Friday that a new count of faulty transmissions replaced by the
company's dealers in the U.S. had boosted the total to 24,000, or 2%
of those sold.</LD>
<TE>   Spencer said Honda "wanted to do the right thing for our
customers--service is a cornerstone of this company."</TE>
<TE>   He said owners of Honda and Acura models covered by the new
warranty would be notified by mail.</TE>
<TE>   No accidents or injuries have been reported in connection with the
transmission failures.</TE>
<TE>   Extending the warranties may be insufficient to satisfy all
customers, however.</TE>
<TE>   Some Honda and Acura owners who contacted The Times after its
report said they wanted their cars recalled and the transmissions
replaced before something could go wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Honda has said a recall is not necessary, and government
regulators agree.</TE>
<TE>   The extended warranties more than double the basic three-year,
36,000-mile transmission coverage on Honda models and add three years
and 50,000 miles of protection to the Acura warranty.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesman Spencer said the extended warranties cover automatic
transmissions in all 2000 through 2001 Honda Accords, Odyssey
minivans and Preludes; all 2000 through 2002 Acura TLs, including the
Type-S; all 2001 through 2002 Acura CLs and CL Type-S models; and
early 2003 Acura TL and CL models, including the Type-S.</TE>
<TE>   Honda said it identified the transmission problems earlier this
year--a weak bearing in four-speed models and a weak third-gear
clutch pack in the five-speed models--and redesigned them.</TE>
<TE>   Although customers also have reported transmission failures in
2002 model Honda Accords and Odysseys, Spencer said the company was
not extending coverage on those models because its research shows
they are not affected by the same problems.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
said that although the agency has received complaints from Honda and
Acura owners, the staff that screens reports for safety issues has
not recommended that an investigation be opened.</TE>
<TE>   Several Honda and Acura buyers contacted The Times to voice
concerns about buying Honda and Acura vehicles in the wake of the
report that thousands of the cars' sophisticated automatic
transmissions had failed and been replaced.</TE>
<TE>   Tustin residents Collin and Jerri Corkum, who bought a 2003 Acura
TL in March, said they were worried that Honda was not offering to
recall and replace all of the transmission.</TE>
<TE>   Collin Corkum said he had asked his Acura dealer and
representatives of NHTSA for advice and been told there is nothing he
can do unless the transmission fails.</TE>
<TE>   "Must we drive in fearful apprehension until it happens? Or should
we sell this car now at a great loss before everybody knows its track
record and the lineup for replacement is several miles long?" he
asked.</TE>
<TE>   It is that kind of customer concern, Spencer said, that Honda is
trying to end by extending transmission repair coverage on
potentially affected vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   James Hossack, an industry analyst with AutoPacific Inc. in
Tustin, said: "This is not only a smart move, it is a necessary move.
If you've got a problem like this, you need to own up to it and fix
it and do it quickly and openly."</TE>
<TE>   The American unit of Honda rival Toyota Motor Corp. recently
received complaints from several thousand customers of major engine
damage caused by an unusual buildup of oil sludge in various Toyota
and Lexus models.</TE>
<TE>   The company said there was nothing wrong with the engines and that
customers were at fault for not following recommended engine oil
change procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of customers responded with proof of regular maintenance.
Toyota ultimately extended warranty coverage on the engines but
maintains that the problem is with improper maintenance, not engine
design.</TE>

<HD>Dow Rises in Cautious Trading</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Qualcomm gives the market a boost, but the
three major indexes still post weekly losses for the fourth straight
week.</DH>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Buyers cautiously returned to Wall Street on Friday, sending stocks
higher on bargain hunting after three days of losses. But the
market's three main indexes still posted a fourth straight weekly
decline.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said investors were ambivalent about the strength of the
economic recovery and third-quarter profits. After disappointing
earnings announcements this week from McDonald's, Electronic Data
Systems and J.P. Morgan Chase, the market got a boost on a positive
outlook from Qualcomm.</LD>
<LD>   "I think what we're seeing is a tug of war between one camp
looking for the economy and corporate earnings to fall significantly
further from where we are, and the other camp looking for the economy
to expand, albeit on a modest path," said Kevin Caron, market
strategist at Ryan, Beck &amp; Co.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 43.63 points, or 0.6%, to
7,986.02. On Thursday, the Dow dropped 230 points to close below
8,000 for the first time since July 23.</TE>
<TE>   The broader market also finished higher. The Nasdaq composite
index rose 4.64 points, or 0.4%, to 1,221.09. The Standard &amp; Poor's
500 index inched up 2.07 points, or 0.3%, to 845.39.</TE>
<TE>   Winners edged out losers on Nasdaq and the New York Stock
Exchange. Trading was brisk because Friday was what is called a
triple-witching session, the quarterly expiration of index futures
and index and stock options. But there was little of the price
volatility that often accompanies triple-witching days.</TE>
<TE>   The three major market gauges all finished the week lower for a
fourth straight week, the first such streak for the Dow and S&amp;P 500
since the period ended June 21. For the week, the Dow lost 3.9%, the
Nasdaq declined 5.4% and the S&amp;P 500 fell 5%.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say investors remain focused on the economy and have
increasingly lost confidence in the last month because of mixed
economic reports, a possible war with Iraq and disappointing earnings
news.</TE>
<TE>   Since hitting a peak Aug. 22, the Dow has lost more than 1,000
points, about 400 of which came in the last three sessions before
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line seems to be that U.S. stocks are stuck in a
trading range and that we still don't know when the economy and
corporate profits will truly start to recover in a sustainable way,"
said Stuart A. Schweitzer, global investment strategist for J.P.
Morgan Fleming Asset Management.</TE>
<TE>   The third quarter is showing a reversal of a recent trend in which
profit warnings from companies had been declining and positive
outlooks had been increasing, according to Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Of 874 pre-announcements this quarter, 457 companies have released
negative outlooks, 208 have been on target and 209 companies have had
positive forecasts, the research firm said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts expect third-quarter operating earnings at companies in
the S&amp;P 500 to rise 8.5% from the year-earlier period, according to
First Call. That's down from Wall Street's expectations of 10.9%
growth just one week ago.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates steady when
it meets Tuesday. Still, analysts expect the Fed to keep its risk
assessment weighted toward economic weakness.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's gainers included Qualcomm, which climbed $2.36 to $28.08
after the telecommunications equipment maker said it expected
first-quarter shipments of phone chips to be significantly higher
than 20 million. Alcatel, another telecom equipment firm, rose 16
cents to $2.61 after saying it would cut 10,000 more workers by the
end of 2003 and warning that sales would fall by 36% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Losers included Duke Energy, which fell $1.02 to $20.40, after
lowering its 2002 earnings estimates below analysts' expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Among other energy shares, Mirant lost 19 cents to $2.32, and
Calpine declined 3 cents to $3.44. Dominion Resources, another
utility that this week said 2003 profit would fall short of
forecasts, lost 50 cents to $50.</TE>
<TE>   Texas Instruments sank $1.25 to $15.78. Investment bank Salomon
Smith Barney cut its rating on the chip maker, citing a soft outlook
for semiconductors and personal computers.</TE>

<HD>FCC May Be Best Hope for PacBell</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS and JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite confusion over SBC Pacific Bell's landmark move into
California's long-distance market, one thing is clear: The state's
largest local phone company is likely to begin offering a full
complement of services by the end of the year.</LD>
<LD>   How that happens, though, is less clear.</LD>
<LD>   The state's Public Utilities Commission knocked SBC PacBell's
carefully laid plans off kilter Thursday when it gave a half-hearted
endorsement to the company's application to sell long- distance in
the country's most lucrative telecommunications market.</LD>
<TE>   In its decision, the PUC created a regulatory dilemma by ruling
that SBC PacBell had "substantially" met the highly technical 14
federal requirements needed to offer long-distance service but failed
a similar state checklist. That means SBC PacBell could theoretically
offer state-to-state calls but not long-distance calls within
California--hardly an attractive offering for consumers.</TE>
<TE>   SBC PacBell, which filed its long-distance application with the
Federal Communications Commission on Friday morning, argues that it
is not required to meet the state rules as long as it meets the
federal rules. The FCC has 90 days to rule on the application, and
SBC PacBell aims to start marketing a range of new services to
consumers by New Year's Eve.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC, which is likely to approve the application, may be SBC
PacBell's best hope. Some lawmakers and regulators suggest that the
federal commission can preempt state rules and grant SBC PacBell full
access to California's $10.5-billion telecommunications market.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe a favorable decision from the FCC will authorize us to
enter both components of the long-distance market and will not be
subject to state interference," SBC PacBell spokesman John Britton
said.</TE>
<TE>   But from the PUC's perspective, SBC PacBell must comply with state
rules by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   The state rules holding up SBC PacBell were written in large part
by the phone company itself. They require four things of local phone
companies wanting to offer long-distance: They must give rivals fair
access to their local lines and equipment, refrain from anti-
competitive behavior, avoid subsidizing long-distance with local
revenue and demonstrate "no substantial possibility of harm" to the
competitive long-distance market in California.</TE>
<TE>   State regulators concluded that SBC PacBell failed all but the
first requirement.</TE>
<TE>   California is too attractive for SBC PacBell--already the state's
largest local phone company, with more than 10 million customers--to
walk away from. The company can already sell long-distance in regions
where it is not the local phone company--Arizona, for instance.</TE>
<TE>   But cratering prices and stiff competition have made it tough to
make money with just long- distance, so SBC PacBell and the other
local phone companies want to sell more profitable packages of
long-distance, local, Internet and other services.</TE>
<TE>   Observers say resolving the matter will largely be a
behind-the-scenes affair, leaving consumers on the sidelines while
SBC PacBell and state regulators try to find a way to satisfy the
state law before the FCC completes its review.</TE>
<TE>   Neither side wants a protracted legal battle.</TE>
<TE>   Although the PUC could sue SBC PacBell or refuse a necessary
license if it doesn't meet the remaining requirements, such a move
would be uncharacteristically confrontational for a regulatory body
that historically has backed away from bare-knuckle fights with phone
companies.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm interested in closing this issue, if it can be closed," said
Geoffrey Brown, the PUC commissioner most closely involved in the
case.</TE>
<TE>   SBC PacBell could convince the PUC that it has satisfied the
California rules.</TE>
<TE>   Brown has suggested, for example, that the consumer protections
built into the PUC's Thursday order could be sufficient.</TE>
<TE>   Those provisions aim to proscribe how SBC PacBell employees can
pitch long-distance to local customers during calls for service or
repair.</TE>
<TE>   "The obvious suggestion here is that the problems are not over,"
said James Bradford Ramsay, general counsel for a nationwide
organization of state utility regulators called the National Assn. of
Regulatory Utility Commissioners. "SBC Pacific Bell is still going to
have to deal with the California commission."</TE>
<TE>   Under the landmark Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress gave
the FCC authority to determine whether a regional Bell telephone
company can offer long- distance service in its home territory. But
lawmakers required the FCC to consult with the Justice Department and
state public utility commissions as well to ensure that local phone
markets were competitive before allowing a Bell phone company to
offer long-distance service.</TE>

<HD>Local Ports Are Back to Normal --for Now</HD>
<DH>Labor: Lockout threat fades as cargo flows at the ports of
L.A. and Long Beach. But the dockworkers union says it's still
short-handed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN and JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cargo moved smoothly through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach
on Friday, one day after a dockworker lockout was narrowly averted.</LD>
<LD>   The Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents West Coast shipping
lines and terminal operators, called off a threatened lockout late
Thursday after the International Longshore and Warehouse Union sent
full crews to unload a ship at the Stevedoring Services of America
terminal.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, union workers continued to report for work, and there
were no unusual backups of big rigs on the roads leading to the port
complex's terminals. While some labor slots were unfilled, PMA
spokesman Jason Greenwald said, the overall labor situation "is good
news."</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the union filed a complaint with the National Labor
Relations Board claiming the threatened lockout was unlawful and was
intended to extract economic concessions. Stevedoring Services had
filed a complaint against the union with the same board Monday,
claiming the union withheld labor from its terminal to split
association members and gain leverage in contract talks.</TE>
<TE>   The union has blamed Stevedoring Services for holding up a
contract agreement by a taking hard-line stance on union
jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   Talks, which began four months ago, continued Friday, with
negotiators discussing the key issue: the companies' desire to
introduce technology that could threaten union jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Discussions were set to continue today.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Federal Mediation and Conciliation Director Peter J.
Hurten offered his services, which was accepted by the PMA but
declined by the union.</TE>
<TE>   The contract being negotiated covers 10,500 dockworkers from San
Diego to Seattle. One UC Berkeley study estimated that a coast-wide
shutdown would cost the U.S. economy $1 billion a day.</TE>
<TE>   ILWU spokesman Steve Stallone said Friday that the union is still
short-handed and struggling to cope with the volume of cargo at the
Los Angeles-Long Beach complex, which has set records over the last
three months. The boom is the result of growing transpacific trade
and importers stocking up for the holiday season.</TE>
<TE>   "There's lots of work and not enough people to meet the demand,"
Stallone said. "We are about 30 skilled crane-trained people short
port-wide."</TE>
<TE>   At the union dispatch hall in Wilmington early Friday, dockworkers
stood in long lines in front of the counters where supervisors handed
out work assignments. Giant video screens indicated where union
members could find work in the port complex.</TE>
<TE>   Workers denied there was any orchestrated attempt to idle
Stevedoring Services or other terminal operators.</TE>
<TE>   "You see there is no slowdown; we are all going to work," said one
longshoreman, who declined to give his name because of a union edict
barring members from speaking to reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, workers said they were angry at the shipping lines
for alleging a work slowdown and threatening a lockout.</TE>
<TE>   "We had 180 orders for crane operators this morning; that's a
record-setting day," said Ramon Ponce de Leon Jr., president of ILWU
Local 13.</TE>
<TE>   By 7:15 a.m., the union had filled 140 of the orders but had run
out of crane operators, a specialized job within the industry. It
filled the remainder gradually over the morning as people came off
other jobs or were contacted at home.</TE>
<TE>   "There is so much work right now that we don't have all the
manpower we need," Ponce de Leon said.</TE>
<TE>   "We did whatever we could to get those jobs filled."</TE>
<TE>   PMA spokesman Steve Sugerman said that as long as crews were
dispatched equally among terminal operators, the association would
not deem the shortage to be an orchestrated job action.</TE>
<TE>   However, he said the PMA would consider a lockout again if it saw
evidence of a slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   The port's leading imports include Asia-produced clothing, toys,
shoes, handbags and consumer electronics.</TE>
<TE>   Staff writer Nancy Cleeland contributed to this report.</TE>

Dockworkers use other terms to describe what's happening on the
waterfront.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>On the waterfront, it's called "hard-timing" or "working to rule." By
any name, it means work on the docks is slowing down.</LD>
<LD>   Cranes move at half speed. Paperwork gets lost. And break times
are assiduously observed. All of it can create a backup of ships
waiting to unload, triggering losses for cargo companies that can
quickly climb into the millions of dollars.</LD>
<LD>   Terminal operators characterize a union slowdown as a "strike with
pay" and claim the tactic is routinely used by the International
Longshore and Warehouse Union when contract talks stall.</LD>
<TE>   This year is no exception, the employers say. This week, the
Pacific Maritime Assn. accused the ILWU of refusing to send crews to
unload a cargo ship from China docked at the Stevedoring Services of
America terminal in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The union denied the accusation, saying it simply did not have
enough skilled workers to send to SSA. But the tensions nearly led to
a lockout of ILWU workers that could have shut down the ports of Los
Angeles and Long Beach and ultimately crippled cargo traffic up and
down the coast.</TE>
<TE>   The back-and-forth left many port veterans recalling past union
tactics that accomplished the same goal: gumming up the works.</TE>
<TE>   "There are many ways of playing this game," said one company
executive who asked not to be named, fearing his dock could be
targeted next.</TE>
<TE>   For example, crane operators have been known to suddenly slow down
and equipment drivers to start strictly adhering to the speed limit:
a mere 10 mph in some cases.</TE>
<TE>   "A good crane driver can do 25, 30 even 35 moves an hour," said
Don Crosatto, a district officer with the International Assn. of
Machinists in Oakland, which has a long-running jurisdictional
dispute with the ILWU concerning maintenance and repair workers at
the docks.</TE>
<TE>   "But when these guys want to develop a case of the slows, they're
doing 18," Crosatto added. "The net effect is that instead of a job
taking four hours, it takes nine. That backs up everything else and
cascades down through the system."</TE>
<TE>   PMA said the union staged slowdowns during each of the past two
contract negotiations, in 1996 and 1999. The union, in turn, denied
they happened every time.</TE>
<TE>   Expecting a repeat this year, the shipping association
commissioned time-and-motion studies to establish average
productivity rates at each of the coast's 29 ports. The speed of each
crane at each port was monitored in different circumstances: in
daylight and at night, in sunshine and in rain.</TE>
<TE>   Those rates can then be easily compared with crane speeds during
an alleged slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   What happened in Long Beach this week was not a classic slowdown.
Because sufficient work crews were not dispatched, fewer cranes were
operated than the shipping line wanted.</TE>
<TE>   PMA and individual shipping lines argued the effect was the same
as a slowdown. Still, there was room for argument.</TE>
<TE>   "A slowdown is when you go to work and work slowly," explained Jay
Luera, Secretary-Treasurer of ILWU Local 13, which represents nearly
5,000 longshore workers in Los Angeles and Long Beach. "You work to
the safety contract. You follow the posted speed limit of 10 miles an
hour. You don't work overtime. Maybe everybody takes their lunch at
the same time."</TE>
<TE>   Luera conceded that such tactics might have been used in previous
years. But he insisted it didn't happen in Long Beach this week.</TE>
<TE>   "This year, we're not even considering that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Warren, a veteran ILWU clerk and a Los Angeles port
commissioner, said he knows what a slowdown looks like.</TE>
<TE>   "You see nothing but trucks down the streets, lined up outside the
terminals," he said. "Nothing moves as fast as normal. Guys don't
drive so well ... people's problem-solving skills are suddenly, shall
we say, diminished."</TE>
<TE>   Warren compared the shippers' accusations this week to those made
three years ago, when a shortage of rail cars led to a long spell of
port congestion that tied up ships and eventually prompted state
legislative hearings. "We got the blame, but when they did the
investigation, they found out it was the railroad," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Slowdowns are prohibited by labor contracts and a union can be
fined for violations. So typically, accusations of slowdowns arise
when a contract has expired--which is the case now.</TE>
<TE>   West Coast dockworkers have been working without a contract since
Sept. 2.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as there is no contract in force, we expect (slowdowns)
will continue to take place," said shipping lines' spokesman Steve
Sugerman.</TE>

<HD>Oracle Chief Quits as Director of Apple</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Software mogul Larry Ellison resigned from Apple Computer Inc.'s
board Friday in a move that analysts attributed to investors' demands
for more vigilant directors.</LD>
<LD>   Ellison, the flamboyant chief executive of Oracle Corp., had
attended fewer than 75% of Apple's board meetings during each of his
five years as a director, according to Securities and Exchange
Commission filings. No other Apple director missed as many meetings
during that time.</LD>
<LD>   Ellison stepped down after concluding that his attendance record
wouldn't improve in upcoming months, given his duties at slumping
Oracle and his upcoming bid in the America's Cup yachting regatta.</LD>
<TE>   "My schedule does not currently allow me to attend enough of the
formal board meetings to warrant a role as a director," Ellison said.</TE>
<TE>   Ellison's spotty attendance at Apple's board meetings hadn't been
an issue until a wave of corporate accounting scandals sharpened Wall
Street's focus on the watchdog role of company boards.</TE>
<TE>   His exit leaves Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple with five board
members, including CEO Steve Jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Ellison, with an estimated fortune of $15 billion, didn't receive
cash for serving on Apple's board. Apple began paying its directors
with stock options in 1997. Ellison held 70,000 Apple stock options,
according to the company's most recent SEC disclosures.</TE>
<TE>   Apple's shares rose 29 cents to close at $14.87 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Eli Lilly to Join Forces With Amylin</HD>
<DH>Drugs: Industry giant will pay up to $325 million, help
promote the biotech company's experimental diabetes treatment and
share the profit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amylin Pharmaceuticals, a San Diego biotechnology company focused on
diabetes, said Friday that Eli Lilly &amp; Co. would pay up to $325
million to co-market one of its leading drug candidates.</LD>
<LD>   The deal is vindication for Amylin, which came within weeks of
having to close its doors in 1998 after Johnson &amp; Johnson backed out
of a partnership deal.</LD>
<LD>   The drug, AC2993, a synthetic version of a peptide found in the
saliva of Gila monsters, helps diabetics better use the limited
amount of insulin their bodies produce.</LD>
<TE>   Amylin and Lilly will share profit from the drug, which could
reach market by 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The deal gives Amylin, a small company with no marketed products,
a strong partner in Lilly, the world's largest supplier of insulin.
Lilly gets a potential blockbuster drug to help solidify its
franchise in diabetes, an obesity-linked condition that affects 17
million Americans.</TE>
<TE>   The deal rewards Amylin's faith in the experimental drug, one of
two the firm staked its future on after J&amp;J pulled the plug. The
company slashed its payroll and fought its way back without support
from the industry's giants, upon which small companies often depend.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone had written us off," said Chairman and Chief Executive
Joseph Cook Jr., a former Lilly executive whose duties once included
overseeing insulin production.</TE>
<TE>   All that changed in September 2001, when Amylin presented
promising data on AC2993 at a medical conference in Glasgow,
Scotland. Ten large pharmaceutical firms expressed interest in the
drug, leading to lengthy negotiations that culminated in Friday's
deal.</TE>
<TE>   Lilly approached Amylin because a similar compound it had been
developing failed in a study, a validation of the smaller company's
science.</TE>
<TE>   The drug is being developed for Type 2 diabetes patients who are
not yet on insulin but not doing well on oral medications, such as
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s Glucophage. The Amylin drug appears
effective at lowering blood sugar in diabetics, which can spike
upward, but does not contribute to weight gain. The drug must be
injected daily, like insulin, which could limit its use.</TE>
<TE>   However, Amylin is developing a longer-acting formulation that
would be taken monthly. The slow-release formulation would have a
clearer advantage over insulin and could better compete with oral
medications that regulate blood sugar, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, Lilly will make a nonrefundable $80-million payment to
Amylin and buy $30 million in Amylin stock at $18.69 a share, a 51%
premium over Amylin's closing price Thursday of $12.40. The purchase
will give Lilly a 2% stake in Amylin.</TE>
<TE>   Lilly will begin funding development of AC2993 after Amylin
successfully completes the final stage of clinical trials, probably
in the second half of 2003. Amylin said it expected to spend $100
million to complete late-stage trials.</TE>
<TE>   Once the studies are finished, Lilly will provide Amylin with a
$110-million convertible loan. Amylin also will get up to $215
million as it completes certain milestones, such as development of
the long-acting formula of AC2993.</TE>
<TE>   The companies will share development costs and operating profit in
the United States. Outside the U.S., Lilly will bear 80% of the costs
and receive 80% of the profit.</TE>
<TE>   Amylin's outlook is significantly brighter than it was four years
ago, when Johnson &amp; Johnson pulled out of a deal to co-promote
another diabetes drug, Symlin.</TE>
<TE>   The action pushed Amylin's stock to its lowest levels. At one
point, Cook said, the company had only 90 days of cash.</TE>
<TE>   Amylin continued to develop Symlin on its own. It says the drug
could receive final approval in the second half of next year,
depending on the results of a not-yet-completed clinical trial.</TE>
<TE>   Amylin's shares soared $1.50, or 12%, closing at $13.90 on Nasdaq,
while Lilly shares rose $1.01, or 2%, to $56.33 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Pitt Backs Shareholder Votes on Options</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt said
Friday that shareholders should have the right to vote on how
companies account for stock options, signaling a shift in SEC policy
that could lead to a wave of proxy votes on the controversial issue.</LD>
<LD>   Treating options as an expense on corporate income statements "is
a topic of major concern to people, and I think shareholders should
have the chance to express their views on it," Pitt said in an
interview with Bloomberg News.</LD>
<LD>   For the last decade, the SEC has allowed companies to simply
reject stockholder proxy proposals on accounting for stock options,
saying the issue falls under "ordinary" business exempt from
shareholder votes. Billionaire Warren Buffett and a growing number of
business leaders have advocated treating options as an expense to
guard against inflated profits and diluted shareholder value.</LD>
<TE>   Pitt didn't endorse treating options as expenses, but he agreed
that shareholders should be given a voice on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "My personal view is that I want to see options be required to be
approved by shareholders in all cases," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of unions, which have billions of dollars of
members' pension funds invested in stocks, say a shift in the SEC
position in favor of proxy resolutions will lead to a wave of
shareholder proposals pressing companies to deduct the costs of
options from net income.</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, the SEC has allowed seven companies to exclude
shareholder proposals on the options-expense issue. The first test
case for reversing that policy may come in an appeal of an SEC
decision in July that allowed National Semiconductor Corp. to throw
out a proxy on the topic.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholders led by the United Brotherhood of Carpenters are
appealing the National Semiconductor decision. Ed Durkin, director of
the union's corporate affairs, said the change in Pitt's position
will lead to "hundreds" of proxy requests to switch option
accounting.</TE>
<TE>   Because most companies hold their annual meetings in April and
May, deadlines for many shareholder proxy proposals will be due in
the next two months.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt declined to say how he would vote on the National
Semiconductor appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Two SEC commissioners--Democrats Harvey Goldschmid and Roel
Campos--have supported calls for requiring companies to treat options
as expenses.</TE>
<TE>   The other two commissioners--Republicans Paul Atkins and Cynthia
Glassman--have urged the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which
sets U.S. accounting rules, to reexamine the issue, which FASB is
doing.</TE>
<TE>   Options--which grant the holder the right to buy shares at a fixed
price--became extremely popular in the 1990s as a way to reward
company executives and rank-and-file workers alike. Unlike salaries
and bonuses, the cost of option awards is not deducted from corporate
earnings under current accounting rules.</TE>
<TE>   The rules require companies to include only an estimate of the
cost in a footnote on financial statements.</TE>
<TE>   But since July 1, more than 95 U.S. companies--including General
Electric Co., Coca-Cola Co. and Washington Post Co.--have announced
they will voluntarily include option expenses in their income
statements.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition to treating options as an expense has been led by
computer-technology companies, including Cisco Systems Inc. and Intel
Corp., which have made options a major share of executive
compensation.</TE>
<TE>   In July, the SEC reversed course on another issue involving
options, allowing shareholder votes on stock option compensation
plans if they would dilute shareholder interest in the company.</TE>
<TE>   Separately on Friday, Pitt said he hopes the SEC would name the
members of the new accounting industry oversight board by the end of
September, which would be one month earlier than the deadline
Congress has set.</TE>
<TE>   The new oversight board was ordered by Congress in the
Sarbanes-Oxley corporate reform bill that President Bush signed into
law July 30. The SEC was given until Oct. 28 to pick the five board
members.</TE>
<TE>   The board will have the power to regulate and discipline the
accounting industry, taking over for a much weaker oversight board
that dissolved itself earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Sources say the SEC had hoped that former Federal Reserve Chairman
Paul Volcker would chair the board, but he has declined.</TE>

<LD>   Nintendo Co. said it has sold its 49% stake in British video game
developer Rare Ltd. to Microsoft Corp. for an undisclosed amount. The
sale paves the way for Microsoft to acquire the remaining ownership
from the studio's founders, Tim and Chris Stamper.</LD>
<TE>   Microsoft, which makes the Xbox game console, has been seeking
premium titles for its box, which has been suffering from a dearth of
exclusive blockbuster titles since its launch last November. The
overall deal is worth more than $300 million, according to sources
close to the negotiations, and would give Microsoft the rights to
"Perfect Dark," a popular game franchise. Microsoft declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Nintendo's sale is unusual not only because the company sees
Microsoft as a rival but also because of its close ties to Rare, a
top-tier studio that has consistently produced hits for Nintendo's
consoles.</TE>
<TE>   Rare's titles include "Donkey Kong Country" and "Goldeneye."</TE>

year because of a slump in energy trading that forced the No. 2 U.S.
utility owner to halt work on three power plants.</LD>
<TE>   Delaying construction of the plants in Nevada, New Mexico and
Washington and writing off development costs on other projects will
result in a third-quarter charge of as much as $300 million, or 23
cents a share, Duke said. Profit this year will fall to $1.95 to
$2.05 and may drop again next year, it said.</TE>

<HD>Judge Orders Nationwide Tobacco Suit</HD>
<DH>Courts: Ruling would lump together millions of injured
smokers for damage awards. Some experts say rejection is likely on
appeal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRON LEVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Laying the groundwork for a tobacco case that would dwarf all others,
a federal judge in Brooklyn, N.Y., ordered that millions of injured
smokers be lumped into a nationwide class that would share a single
pot of punitive damages from cigarette manufacturers.</LD>
<LD>   If upheld on appeal, the novel ruling late Thursday by U.S.
District Judge Jack B. Weinstein could result in cigarette makers
paying billions of dollars into a giant fund, to be divided by a
formula among all Americans who can show proof of smoking-related
injuries since 1993.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling is meant to reform what amounts to a lottery system in
which a few plaintiffs may reap a windfall in damages while a greater
number suffering from identical smoking-related ailments win nothing
at all.</LD>
<TE>   No estimates have been made of the potential size of the class.
But given estimates that more than 400,000 Americans die prematurely
each year from smoking-related causes, it could be enormous.</TE>
<TE>   However, federal courts generally have rejected class-action
status for tobacco cases on the grounds that individual differences
among smokers--including when they started and how much they
smoked--overwhelm the common issues. Some observers said Weinstein's
order, which outlines a numbingly complex procedure for setting
damages, is likely to be rejected by the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of
Appeals.</TE>
<TE>   Tobacco industry lawyers said they would seek reversal of the
order, and in his own ruling Weinstein suggested that the panel
entertain an appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Widely regarded as brilliant and unconventional, the 81-year-old
Weinstein is known for crafting sweeping settlements involving toxic
substances such as asbestos and Agent Orange. He had long signaled
his desire to create a structure for reaching a global resolution of
tobacco litigation, so his ruling wasn't unexpected.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth J. Cabraser, a San Francisco lawyer whom Weinstein
appointed lead plaintiffs' counsel, said the ruling would help
tobacco victims who want to sue but can't find a lawyer to do battle
with the industry.</TE>
<TE>   Several hundred individual claims are pending in courts around the
country, but there would be more if there were lawyers willing to
take them.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling "gives smokers the opportunity to hold the tobacco
companies fully accountable for all of the harm their conduct and
their products have done over the years," Cabraser said.</TE>
<TE>   But William S. Ohlemeyer, vice president and associate general
counsel with Philip Morris Cos., said the order "is inconsistent with
where the law is on the issue of aggregating claims and treating them
as class actions, especially in tobacco cases."</TE>
<TE>   "Although we strongly disagree with Judge Weinstein's ruling, this
order now makes it possible for an appellate court to decide these
issues," Ohlemeyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Along with Philip Morris, defendants include R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Co., Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. and its parent British American
Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco, Liggett Group Inc. and UST Inc., whose
brands include Copenhagen and Skoal.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Gillers, a New York University law professor, described
Weinstein's ruling as "quite remarkable" but probably doomed.</TE>
<TE>   "Jack Weinstein is probably the most procedurally creative judge
sitting in the United States today, but here he's asking the court
system to do something that I think is beyond its competence,"
Gillers said. There's "almost no chance that the 2nd Circuit will
allow this to go forward in this way."</TE>
<TE>   The order establishes a class of all U.S. residents who have
smoked since 1993 and been diagnosed with at least one of 16
identified diseases, including emphysema and heart disease. There is
no provision for members to opt out of the class and pursue claims on
their own.</TE>
<TE>   However, excluded from the class are nonsmokers stricken with
these ailments and those whose suits against the industry have been
resolved.</TE>
<TE>   Also excluded are class members in Engle vs. R.J. Reynolds, a
Florida case in which tobacco companies were ordered to pay $144.8
billion in punitive damages to a statewide class of injured smokers.
The state court verdict in July 2000 is on appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Weinstein's order sets a Jan. 20, 2003, start date for the first
stage of a three-part trial. According to the plan:</TE>
<TE>   * In the first phase, the jury would determine whether cigarette
makers are liable and estimate the value of compensatory damages that
would be owed to all members of the class. Compensatory damages
wouldn't be paid out, but the amount would be used as a benchmark to
set the punitive damages. The jury also would resolve the individual
claims of the 14 class representatives.</TE>
<TE>   * In phase two, jurors would determine whether punitive damages
were warranted. If the answer was no, the case would end without a
third phase.</TE>
<TE>   * In phase three, jurors would decide the total punitive damages
to be awarded and the amount to be allocated to each disease.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the order says, the court would distribute punitive
damages to individual class members "submitting appropriate proof."
The order does not say whether the proof means first winning
compensatory damages at a separate trial, or whether medical records
alone would suffice. The order says punitive damages not divided
among class members would be spent on medical research.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Gottlieb, a lawyer with the Tobacco Products Liability
Project, which promotes lawsuits against tobacco companies, called
the trial plan "fantastic" but also "a little bit frightening."</TE>
<TE>   On the one hand, he said, the verdict of a single jury could
devastate the industry, "but on the other hand, if that jury does not
award punitive damages or issues a relatively small award, it will
alleviate the threat."</TE>
<TE>   Philip Morris shares fell $2.01 to $42.69, R.J. Reynolds slumped
$3.23 to $47.22 and UST lost $1.14 to $28.85, all on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Investors Shun Japan Bonds</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Japan failed Friday for the first time to find buyers for all the
10-year bonds it put up for sale at an auction, reflecting investor
concerns about the government's resolve to fix the nation's economic
problems.</LD>
<LD>   The Finance Ministry's surprising announcement on the auction of
the government's key long-term securities sent government bond prices
spiraling lower and their yields soaring.</LD>
<LD>   Taken with a weakening yen and falling stocks, the bond market
drop stoked fears of a temporary flight from Japanese markets.</LD>
<TE>   The ministry offered $14.6 billion in 10-year bonds in the auction
but was able to sell only $11 billion, or 75%. The bonds offered
annual yields of about 1.2%.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first time the ministry didn't sell all its 10-year
bonds since it introduced the auction system in 1988, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In Tokyo on Friday, the Nikkei stock index fell nearly 2% and the
yen tumbled against the dollar and euro. Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.,
though critical of recent moves by the Japanese government, said it
would not lower the country's credit rating for the time being.</TE>
<TE>   The bond market's woes Friday contrast sharply with its popularity
in recent months. With stocks recently hitting 19-year lows,
long-term bonds have been the securities of choice for investors in
Japan, just as American investors have snapped up U.S. Treasuries.</TE>
<TE>   Only a week ago, Japanese 10-year bond yields hit four-year lows
of 1.04%. By late Friday, investors were demanding 1.3% on existing
securities.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Friday's auction bombed because Prime Minister
Junichiro Koizumi's government has not yet shown its resolve to turn
the economy around by tackling deflation and banks' huge bad loans.</TE>
<TE>   Traders said some investors were buying short-term Japanese
government securities or swapping Japanese bonds for euro bonds.</TE>
<TE>   The market downswing comes despite the Bank of Japan's
unprecedented plan, announced Wednesday, to help banks get rid of
their bad loans and prop up the financial system by buying stocks
they own.</TE>
<TE>   Although Japan's downturn appears to have bottomed out and signs
of better times have appeared, unemployment is soaring and deflation
continues to plague the economy.</TE>

<TE>   Mexico's Peso Falls</TE>
<TE>   on Strike Concerns</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's peso fell to new 44-month lows against the dollar Friday
amid concerns about Brazil's market turmoil, a possible war in Iraq
and strike threats at Mexico's state oil monopoly Pemex, analysts
said.</TE>
<TE>   With losses Thursday as well, the peso has declined almost 3% in
the last two days of trading.</TE>
<TE>   The currency closed Friday at 10.31 to the dollar, down from
Thursday's close of 10.18 and its lowest level since January 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The peso's weakening has been attributed mostly to a slump in U.S.
and local stocks, as well as concerns about the outcome of Brazil's
upcoming elections.</TE>
<TE>   But concerns about a possible Pemex strike have aggravated the
external factors, said Gabriel Sod-Hoffs, a currency strategist at
J.P. Morgan.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't expect there to be a strike, but the concerns reflect
the difficult political environment in Mexico at the moment,"
Sod-Hoffs said.</TE>
<TE>   But Mexico's main stock market index, which dropped 5.3% on
Thursday, regained some of that loss Friday, ending up 2.6% at
5,788.78, in what traders described as a technical rebound and bottom
fishing for Mexican blue-chip shares.</TE>
<TE>   The stock market reversed a five-session losing streak, but the
main index still shed 6.5% for the week.</TE>
<TE>   At state oil giant Pemex, there are concerns that workers could go
on strike Oct. 2, crippling operations for one of the world's largest
producers of crude.</TE>
<TE>   Some investors are worried that the government could buckle to
union demands for a 15% wage hike.</TE>
<TE>   The continuing slide of Brazil's currency, the real, amid mounting
concerns that leftist candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will win
presidential elections next month also has weighed on Mexican
financial markets, analysts say.</TE>

<LD>Archdiocese cutbacks--A story in Section A on Thursday about budget
cutbacks by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles incorrectly
reported that its Detention Ministry office, which serves inmates in
jails, prisons and juvenile halls, was one of several offices being
eliminated entirely. The Detention Ministry staff is being cut in
half. The story also incorrectly reported the date on which employees
were told of the cutbacks. It was Sept. 10, not Sept. 12.</LD>

<DH>Sports: Anaheim is thrilled with the Angels' success but
wary of celebrating too soon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Somebody should pinch Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly just to remind him it's
not a dream: The Anaheim native--and rabid Angels fan--is basking in
the glow of good PR and tooting the horn for civic pride.</LD>
<LD>   Who can blame him or the rest of the city? The Angels are having
the best season in their 42-year history--not to mention one of the
best records in baseball. And for the first time, the word "Anaheim"
is emblazoned on the team's road uniforms.</LD>
<LD>   "The Anaheim Angels are mentioned prominently in every sports
report every day in every corner of the United States--and not just
one time, but every day for four to five weeks," Daly said. "I'm not
sure you can place a dollar value on that."</LD>
<TE>   Daly, who has cheered for the Angels since he was a kid, is
positively giddy.</TE>
<TE>   He's not alone. From city brass to bartenders, people in
Anaheim--and across Orange County--have been stricken with Halo
Fever.</TE>
<TE>   The mathematics of the remaining games makes it almost certain the
Angels will make the playoffs, barring a complete breakdown. If so,
they could start postseason play as early as Oct. 1. Fans already are
camped out at Edison International Field to gobble up playoff tickets
that go on sale today.</TE>
<TE>   All the excitement has the city engaged in a precarious balancing
act. On one hand, it's scrambling behind the scenes to promote the
ballclub. At the same time, the city doesn't want to jinx the team
until a playoff berth is secured. After all, the Angels have a long
tradition of collapsing in September.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little premature for us to break out the champagne," said
Mike Neben, president and chief executive officer of Anaheim's
Chamber of Commerce. "Until they clinch a championship role, we're
not ready to start planning parade routes and things like that."</TE>
<TE>   He couldn't help adding: "We do expect that they will win."</TE>
<TE>   City spokesman John Nicoletti said Anaheim is taking a page from
Mike Scioscia's playbook, a motto the Angels' manager has been
preaching for weeks: One game at a time.</TE>
<TE>   For now, they plan to congratulate the team for its
record-breaking season with a proclamation at Tuesday's City Council
meeting. They're also urging fans to pack Edison Field for the last
series of the regular season, a three-day stand against Seattle
beginning Friday. The first two days already are sold out.</TE>
<TE>   Massive red banners measuring three stories high will start
unfurling on City Hall, the Convention Center and other spots around
town. Five hundred city employees will sport red Anaheim Angel
T-shirts. Any reference to the year and the playoffs is conveniently
absent from the shirts and banners, Nicoletti said, "so that we can
use them again next October."</TE>
<TE>   Nicoletti also is busy compiling Anaheim facts, comparing stats
such as population and civic amenities with those of potential
playoff cities New York and Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   City officials want to ensure that sports reporters across the
country needn't resort to the tired old jabs that Anaheim suffers an
inferiority complex from being in the shadow of Los Angeles. They're
sick of heckles about comatose fans and that the Disney-owned Angels
are nothing more than a "Mickey Mouse team."</TE>
<TE>   If Daly had his 10 seconds on CNN, he'd broadcast a simple
message: Anaheim is a major league city. "It doesn't get much better
than this," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Daly's having trouble sleeping. He can't concentrate on work. A
running joke at home is that he and his pregnant wife will name the
baby (due in March) after the Angel who performs best in the
playoffs. Even if it's a girl.</TE>
<TE>   He takes every opportunity to talk up his team. At a recent
groundbreaking for a police substation, he asked the crowd of 200 how
many weren't from Anaheim. A few people raised their hands. "Welcome
to our city," he told them. "You are visiting the home of the
first-place Anaheim Angels."</TE>
<TE>   The audience erupted in cheers.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 1, which is the first day of playoffs, the City Council
could face an interesting quandary since it also is scheduled to
meet. Daly said he might play hooky or it could be one of the
shortest council meetings ever.</TE>
<TE>   After beating the Mariners, 8-1, Friday night in Seattle, the
Angels remained one game behind AL West Division-leading Oakland. If
the Angels beat Seattle today, they will clinch their first playoff
berth since 1986.</TE>
<TE>   Fans are proudly donning the Angels' baseball cap.</TE>
<TE>   Johnnie Atkinson, manager of the National Sports Grill across from
Edison International Field, said he's seeing a lot more red. And on a
recent night at the Clubhouse in Costa Mesa, every TV was tuned to
the Angels' game. Forget that other playoff race. Dodgers-Giants? Old
news.</TE>
<TE>   Angel management is playing it low-key now, but promises plenty of
fireworks when the team returns home. "The PR is on the field right
now. There's not much you can really add to it," said Tim Mead, the
Angels' vice president of communications. "There's a pride in saying
'the Angels.' There's a buzz out there."</TE>
<TE>   The buzz is in the victories. Win. That's all the fans want.</TE>
<TE>   The die-hards started lining up Wednesday to buy playoff tickets
even though the clinching game could be days away. They brought
sleeping bags, portable televisions, coolers and Tom Clancy novels.
It's a long wait until 9 a.m. Saturday, when sales begin.</TE>
<TE>   The team may have lost its last two games going into Friday, but
there's a confidence there, a stubborn pride, even, that just keeps
growing. Consider Costa Mesa residents Adella and Bob Sherrell, who
are willing to bed down on the parking lot pavement to see their team
in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Sherrell has been waiting more than 10 years for his license
plate holder to come true: "Field of Dreams. Angels Win Series."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<LD>A giant American flag that flew for almost 30 years beside the Santa
Monica Freeway has been stolen, its owners said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "Late Tuesday night, somebody climbed over our 7-foot gate, got
past two guard dogs and cut through a three-eighths-inch steel cable"
that was used as a halyard, said Mike Matosian, a senior official at
Southern California Disposal Co. on Delaware Avenue. "It looks like
they took a hatchet to that thing."</LD>
<LD>   Matosian said the 30-by-50-foot flag was taken once before, in
1975. It was a fraternity prank, and the culprits returned the flag.</LD>

<LD>The City Council voted unanimously Friday to endorse county Measure B
on the Nov. 5 ballot, a tax increase that would raise $168 million
annually to maintain hospital emergency rooms and trauma centers.</LD>
<LD>   The measure will allow the county to charge three cents per square
foot per year on all improved properties in Los Angeles County.
Councilwoman Janice Hahn said it is a small price to pay for
emergency services.</LD>
<LD>   "It's clear the county's health-care system is in dire need of
financial assistance," Hahn said.</LD>

<HD>Astronaut Avoids Assault Charges</HD>
<DH>Crime: Prosecutor says Buzz Aldrin was incited to strike
man who called moon landings a hoax.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County district attorney's office will not file
charges against Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin for hitting a man who
has long insisted the U.S. moon landings were a hoax.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Elizabeth Ratinoff, who is in charge of the
district attorney's Beverly Hills office, said in a statement that
Aldrin had been provoked into hitting Bart Sibrel of Nashville in the
face in front of the Luxe Hotel in Beverly Hills last week.</LD>
<LD>   "Aldrin was confronted by ... Sibrel who arranged to surprise
Aldrin and challenge his integrity about walking on the moon,"
Ratinoff said. "Video depicts Sibrel following Aldrin on the street
and thrusting a Bible at Aldrin. Others attempted to protect Aldrin
as he walked away from Sibrel.</LD>
<TE>   "Ultimately, Sibrel called Aldrin a thief, liar and coward. Video
depicts Aldrin striking Sibrel once in the face with a fist. Sibrel
immediately turns to the camera crew present and appears to twice
state, 'Did you get that?'</TE>
<TE>   "Sibrel was not knocked down," Ratinoff said. "He sustained no
visible injury. He did not seek medical attention. Aldrin has no
prior criminal arrest history.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on the totality of the circumstances," she added, "it is
unlikely a jury would find Aldrin guilty of a misdemeanor battery
charge."</TE>
<TE>   The 72-year-old Aldrin's attorney, Robert O'Brien, said, "We
welcome this decision and appreciate the prompt and professional
manner in which the Beverly Hills Police Department and the Los
Angeles district attorney's office handled this matter.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect that in the future Mr. Sibrel will refrain from
harassing Dr. Aldrin and his fellow Apollo astronauts."</TE>
<TE>   Sibrel, at a Beverly Hills news conference, said he believed the
district attorney's office was simply not inclined to prosecute a
celebrity like Aldrin.</TE>

<HD>Evidence of Teen's Beliefs Permitted</HD>
<DH>Testimony: Robert Coffman's alleged white supremacist views
may be introduced at his trial in the beating death of a transient,
judge rules.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors will be allowed to present evidence that a Ventura teen's
white supremacist beliefs led to the beating and stoning death of a
homeless man, a judge ruled Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Coffman, 19, is one of four teenagers accused of pelting
transient James Clark, 58, with rocks and kicking him in the head as
he lay in his sleeping bag near the Ventura River last year.</LD>
<LD>   Coffman, an Oak View resident, is charged with murder and robbery
in Clark's slaying.</LD>
<TE>   He is also charged with attempted murder in the stabbing of a man
at the Ventura beachfront promenade a day after the slaying.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Superior Court Judge Ken Riley granted a
prosecution request to join the murder and attempted murder cases.
Defense lawyers had hoped to keep the charges separate.</TE>
<TE>   Riley also ruled that prosecutors could present evidence of
Coffman's alleged involvement in a white supremacist group and elicit
testimony from a gang expert on whether Clark's killing was
gang-related.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers Kay Duffy and James Farley argued that the
proposed testimony is not relevant and would serve only to inflame
the jury. Coffman is not charged with a gang offense or a hate crime.</TE>
<TE>   But Deputy Dist. Atty. Stacy Ratner countered that Coffman
targeted Clark because he was homeless and thus, in the defendant's
white supremacist views, not worthy of living in society. Ratner
described the attack as a "boot party" in which white supremacists
kick and stomp a victim in the head.</TE>
<TE>   According to police, Coffman and three other teenagers were
partying at the beach the night of June 29, 2001, when they stumbled
into Clark, beat him and stole his belongings.</TE>
<TE>   Clark, a military veteran who had roamed Ventura's streets for
years, had been living in a river-bottom encampment.</TE>
<TE>   His body was found the morning after the attack. The coroner
concluded that Clark died from blows to his head.</TE>
<TE>   Coffman is described by the other teenagers as the instigator of
the assault. He is the second suspect to be tried in Clark's death.</TE>
<TE>   Timothy Becker, 19, and Christopher Dunham, 19, both of Ventura,
are awaiting trial.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, a Juvenile Court judge convicted Rocky Mattley,
15, of Ventura of second-degree murder and ordered him committed to
the California Youth Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Mattley, Becker and Dunham are listed as potential prosecution
witnesses at Coffman's trial, which is scheduled to begin next week.</TE>

<HD>Man Awarded Nearly $650,000 for False Arrest</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal jury has found Culver City and one of its police detectives
liable for nearly $650,000 in damages for the false arrest of a
35-year-old man on charges of kidnapping and sexually assaulting a
13-year-old boy.</LD>
<LD>   Luther Bristol Coppage III of Los Angeles was acquitted of the
charges after a 1998 trial in Superior Court, but not before spending
four months behind bars.</LD>
<LD>   In his federal lawsuit, Coppage accused police of arresting him
even though the boy and his parents had given them conflicting and
unreliable information about the alleged crime and the assailant.</LD>
<TE>   The jury also ordered the boy and his parents to pay Coppage
$50,000 each in damages for malicious prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   James F. Feffer, a private attorney who represented Culver City in
the trial, said Friday that he was considering asking that the award
be reduced or seeking a retrial. The case had been tried a year ago
in U.S. District Court, but a mistrial was declared when the jury
declared that it was hopelessly deadlocked.</TE>

<HD>Governor Calls Off Gathering of Donors</HD>
<DH>Politics: Sponsor of planned fund-raiser has ties to
high-speed rail bill the governor just signed. Simon denounces his
rival at the event's site.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN and MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis on Friday canceled a fund-raiser aimed at generating
donations from boosters of high-speed rail, as his Republican
challenger pointedly accused him of raising money from beneficiaries
of legislation he has signed into law.</LD>
<LD>   In an attempt to dramatize the point, GOP nominee Bill Simon Jr.
traveled to the site of the canceled fund-raiser--the Santa Clara
home of Rod Diridon, the Davis-appointed chairman of the High Speed
Rail Authority--and called for an investigation of the governor's
"corrupt administration."</LD>
<LD>   "Sadly," Simon told a cluster of reporters and TV crews outside
Diridon's home, "we now have the latest chapter of Gov. Davis
auctioning off state policy to the highest bidder."</LD>
<TE>   At a minimum, Simon said, the governor's fund-raising tactics were
"unethical and beneath the dignity of the office of governor of
California." But he also suggested that the practice might be
illegal, and called on Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer to investigate.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer's spokesman, Nathan Barankin, shrugged off the request as
politically motivated: "There is nothing new about political charges
and countercharges.... Nonetheless, we will carefully review Mr.
Simon's charges, and respond to them as appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   Diridon, a longtime backer both of Davis and of the concept of
bullet train service in California, organized the fund-raiser, which
had been scheduled for Friday afternoon, to pay tribute to Davis. In
an e-mail to advocates of high-speed rail, Diridon urged people "who
will build, operate and maintain the system throughout the nation and
especially here in California" to attend the $2,000-per-couple event.</TE>
<TE>   The fund-raiser would have been a day after Davis signed
legislation placing on the 2004 ballot a $9.9-billion bond to help
finance construction of a high-speed train system in California.
Diridon attended the elaborate bill-signing event at the California
Railroad Museum in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis campaign committee, which on Thursday had defended his
plans to attend the fund-raiser, switched positions on Friday,
issuing a brief statement saying the governor would not attend and
would return any checks from donors who had planned to go.</TE>
<TE>   "The committee's strict guidelines regarding the necessity for
committee approval of all communications distributed by an event host
were not followed in this case," the statement said. "Under these
circumstances, the governor decided it would be inappropriate to go
ahead with the event."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the cancellation, Davis stood by Diridon, saying in a
statement: "There is no reason at this time to ask for Mr. Diridon's
resignation. To our knowledge, he is doing a good job as chair of
California High Speed Rail Authority. Clearly, he made a mistake with
regard to the event and that's why the event was canceled."</TE>
<TE>   The decision to cancel the fund-raiser--a rare occurrence for the
governor--came a day after he appeared before the Sacramento Bee's
editorial board and defended his fund-raising practices. The governor
has raised more than $62 million for his reelection, including $21.5
million so far this year.</TE>
<TE>   "I have conducted myself in an appropriate fashion in accordance
with the law and I have no apologies for what I've done," Davis was
quoted as telling the Bee.</TE>
<TE>   Simon again criticized Davis for his practice of raising money in
September, when he must decide whether to sign or veto more than
1,200 bills. The governor has raised more than $2.5 million so far
this month. Simon renewed his pledge not to raise money during
bill-signing season if elected.</TE>
<TE>   Simon also called on Davis to release his fund-raising schedule, a
demand rejected repeatedly by Davis. At the news conference, Simon
mocked Davis' remarks about the matter to the Sacramento Bee. When
the board asked Davis to disclose his fund-raising schedule, the
governor responded, "Why don't you go to bed with me? Why don't you
move in? You're not going to get it. Forget it."</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Davis," Simon said, "the people of California don't want to
go to bed with you. They just want you to put in an honest day's
work."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Diridon dismissed the Simon demonstration outside his
house, saying: "It is his right, and it was a skillful political
ploy."</TE>
<TE>   Citing Simon's personal wealth, Diridon said he was proud that he
had tried to help Davis' reelection by offering to host the event.
But he added that the governor had made the right decision to cancel.
The juxtaposition of the Friday fund-raiser and the Thursday bill
signing was an unfortunate coincidence that "gave the appearance of
impropriety," Diridon said.</TE>

<HD>DNA Testing of All Rape Evidence Urged</HD>
<DH>Policy: Two City Council members call for LAPD inventory
and analysis of backlogged evidence, and checks with state's sex
offenders database.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alarmed at the LAPD's destruction of 1,000 untested rape-evidence
kits, two Los Angeles City Council members proposed Friday that all
such evidence in violent crimes be inventoried and tested for DNA.</LD>
<LD>   Normally, detectives give priority to testing evidence when a
suspect has been identified because there has not been enough money
to test every rape kit.</LD>
<LD>   A huge backlog of biological evidence has developed as a result,
officials said.</LD>
<TE>   In July, the Los Angeles Police Department admitted that it
mistakenly destroyed about 1,000 packets of biological evidence,
leading to an outcry by rape victims and their advocates.</TE>
<TE>   The department has imposed a moratorium on destroying rape kits,
but council members Jack Weiss and Jan Perry said during a news
conference with rape survivors that much more needs to be done.</TE>
<TE>   The council members introduced two motions, including one that
would endorse pending federal legislation known as the Debbie Smith
Act, which would provide grants to states to increase education,
testing and analysis of DNA evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether or not it becomes federal law, there is no excuse for
this city to keep doing business the way it has been doing business,"
Weiss told the council Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The other motion asks the council to adopt a policy prohibiting
police from destroying rape kits and other DNA evidence from violent
crimes, and calls for an inventory and testing of all backlogged
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Tested evidence should be put through the state's "Cold Hit"
program, which matches DNA evidence with a database of known
offenders, the council members said.</TE>
<TE>   "DNA testing gives us the ability to identify and catch rapists
who until now have gotten away with their crimes," Weiss said.</TE>
<TE>   "This critical evidence is locked away in the LAPD's freezers
while rapists are free to assault more women."</TE>
<TE>   The council members proposed that the Police Commission report on
the cost of testing all rape kits for DNA evidence and whether
private labs need to be used to handle the workload.</TE>
<TE>   The commission also was asked to develop a plan to test all
evidence within 10 days of a crime, and to determine whether a
proposed new crime lab needs to be redesigned to provide enough space
to handle the DNA testing plan.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal on expanding the crime lab is significant because the
current design has the LAPD's DNA lab half the size of the Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Department's DNA lab in the joint facility,
even though both agencies have the same caseload, said county
prosecutor Lisa Kahn, deputy in charge of the district attorney's
forensic sciences section.</TE>
<TE>   The proposals were endorsed Friday by Jeri Elster, a rape survivor
who has worked to change laws at the state and federal level to
remove the statute of limitations on rapes for cases going back to
1995.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a wonderful step in the right direction," she said.</TE>

<HD>Officials Returning Film Agency Contributions</HD>
<DH>Controversy: Group fighting secession also returns $25,000
to EIDC, the focus of D.A. probe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BERRY, TED RORHLICH and PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two elected officials and Mayor James K. Hahn's anti-secession group
said Friday that they are returning campaign contributions from the
quasi-public agency that promotes filming in Los Angeles County.</LD>
<LD>   An official of the L.A. United Campaign said it has returned
$25,000 in contributions from the Entertainment Industry Development
Corp., which is under investigation by the district attorney's office
for possible misuse of public funds.</LD>
<LD>   County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke said she has returned
$2,000 to EIDC. And Los Angeles City Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski
said she is refunding $500. Miscikowski said she will repay the money
with a personal check.</LD>
<TE>   Three other elected officials said they will return campaign funds
if it is determined that they can do so legally. One of those three,
Councilman Dennis Zine, said he is also seeking to resign as a member
of the EIDC's board of directors "as a matter of conscience."</TE>
<TE>   . Prosecutors are investigating funds spent by the Hollywood-based
organization for political contributions and for personal expenses.
Hahn and all members of the City Council and the county Board of
Supervisors automatically are board members of the EIDC</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, whose mayoral campaign received $2,000 from EIDC, is not
returning the donation because the campaign account is long closed,
according to Kam Kuwata, who is now running the anti-secession
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Kuwata said the money given to the campaign against San Fernando
Valley secession was returned because it "became too much of a
distraction."</TE>
<TE>   Secession leaders have sharply criticized the EIDC contributions
and said the decision to return the money is too little, too late.</TE>
<TE>   "He is doing this because he got caught," said Richard Katz,
co-chair of the Valley Independence Committee, referring to Hahn. "He
is giving it back because it is a distraction ... He has a problem
understanding the difference between public funds and political slush
funds."</TE>
<TE>   Zine, City Councilman Hal Bernson and City Controller Laura Chick,
who is not on the EIDC board, said they will also return their EIDC
contributions if it is determined that it is legal to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Several council members said the legal question arises from the
fact that the campaigns for which they received the contributions are
long over. As a result, they have asked the Ethics Commission whether
they can repay the money from other funds, such as their officeholder
accounts.</TE>
<TE>   The EIDC gave $500 each to Zine and Bernson, and $1,000 to Chick,
they said.</TE>
<TE>   Zine said he had not been aware he was a member of the board,
adding "that this controversy really troubles me."</TE>
<TE>   He said he wants to give the contribution back "in good faith to
show that there is integrity in the fact that there is this
investigation by the [Los Angeles County] district attorney's
office."</TE>
<TE>   Miscikowski said she is returning the money "in light of the
recent information that has come to my attention" that the EIDC may
be a public agency, rather than a private entity.</TE>
<TE>   Miscikowski cited a 1995 letter from a Fair Political Practices
Commission lawyer to the Los Angeles city attorney's office in which
the FPPC lawyer analyzed the EIDC's status and concluded it was a
"local government agency."</TE>
<TE>   Glenda Wina, spokeswoman for Burke, said the supervisor "thought
it was not a proper thing to do for EIDC to make contributions." Wina
said Burke also returned the money because "she didn't want the
appearance of impropriety."</TE>

<HD>Last Nails in Coffin for an El Toro Airport?</HD>
<DH>Analysis: First a judge throws out a challenge to the
'Great Park' plan voters approved. Then the governor sinks an airport
incentive bill.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The last-ditch campaign to keep the El Toro airport plan alive
appeared to have collapsed this week, with even some die-hard airport
advocates saying it's time to move on.</LD>
<LD>   The latest piece of bad news for the pro-airport camp came Friday,
when Gov. Gray Davis declared the airport proposal dead and let die a
bill that would have pressured Orange County to provide a greater
share of the region's air passenger and cargo service.</LD>
<LD>   Davis' decision came two days after a Los Angeles judge threw out
a challenge to the voter-approved ballot measure that rezoned the
closed El Toro Marine base from an airport to a park.</LD>
<TE>   "We saw the fat lady singing with the judge's decision, and now
the governor is harmonizing with her," said Stan Oftelie, president
and CEO of the Orange County Business Council, a leading backer of an
El Toro airport.</TE>
<TE>   Some airport proponents had hoped Davis would sign the bill, which
called on Southern California counties to provide their "fair share"
of future air passenger and cargo traffic or risk losing some
aviation funds. Orange County currently provides far less air
service, proportional to its population, than Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   But Assemblyman Lou Correa (D-Anaheim), a vocal El Toro airport
advocate, said Friday he urged Davis to veto the legislation,
concluding that enough is enough. "I've been a proponent of the
airport and we've fought over this issue for God knows how many
years," Correa said. "[But] at this point, we need to move on and
bring some utility to this base."</TE>
<TE>   Davis, in his first public comments on the controversy, said local
voters have spoken.</TE>
<TE>   "While this bill is intended to bring about a more balanced
distribution of the expected increase in aviation traffic, it also
ignores the will of many Orange County residents," Davis said in a
prepared statement.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Board of Supervisors, which for a decade has
been trying to plan an international airport at the 4,700-acre base,
formally dropped its efforts after voters approved a ballot measure
in March that would convert El Toro into a "Great Park."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the action, some airport loyalists continued to hold out
hope that the measure would be found unconstitutional and that the
Board of Supervisors could somehow be pressured to reconsider the
plan.</TE>
<TE>   But there is growing division among pro-airport forces over
whether this is still the correct strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Oftelie, for example, says business interests should now focus on
ways to increase passenger and cargo service at existing Southern
California airports. Orange County has just one commercial
airport--John Wayne--and its flight capacity is limited under a court
settlement with Newport Beach residents.</TE>
<TE>   Some airport advocates remain convinced that an El Toro
international airport still has a chance.</TE>
<TE>   In a strategy even some airport proponents concede is a longshot,
the Airport Working Group of Orange County hopes to persuade the Bush
administration to keep El Toro as an airfield for national security
reasons.</TE>
<TE>   The group is circulating a petition asking the secretary of the
Navy, which owns the base, to turn over 2,000 acres of the 4,700-acre
base to the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA would then lease
the property to Los Angeles World Airports as an airport. El Toro
airport advocates also plan to appeal the judge's decision on the
ballot measure.</TE>
<TE>   "There are definite options out there," said Barbara Lichman,
attorney for the Working Group.</TE>
<TE>   Others aren't so sure.</TE>
<TE>   "It has a last-gasp quality to it," Oftelie said.</TE>
<TE>   That view is shared by anti-airport forces, who say this week's
events speak for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "For probably the first time, I really feel it's over," said Meg
Waters, spokeswoman for the anti-airport El Toro Reuse Planning
Authority. "The battle for an airport at El Toro is over once and for
all."</TE>

<HD>Biologists Find an 'Extinct' Sunflower</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET and CAROL CHAMBERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Biologists working for the developer of a proposed 21,700-home
project near Santa Clarita have found a sunflower on the site not
seen since 1937 and thought to have been extinct.</LD>
<LD>   The same developer, Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co., on Friday was
charged with a misdemeanor on suspicion of altering a streambed in
the area.</LD>
<LD>   The 10-to 12-foot Los Angeles sunflower was found on a boggy bank
along the Santa Clara River. It produces large yellow blossoms much
like the standard sunflower, prefers marshy habitats and was once
found in San Bernardino, Orange, Riverside and Los Angeles counties.</LD>
<TE>   It was forced into apparent extinction by urbanization and the
channelization of many Southern California waterways, said Steve
Boyd, curator of the herbarium at the Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden
in Claremont.</TE>
<TE>   Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co. this week wrote to the state Department
of Fish and Game, requesting that the flower be added to the state
list of endangered and threatened plants.</TE>
<TE>   Plants and animals thought to be extinct have no protection under
state laws, said Mary Meyer, a plant ecologist with Fish and Game.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office had been
investigating whether the company has disturbed the habitat of the
endangered San Fernando spineflower. The office would not say what
the result of that investigation was.</TE>
<TE>   But on Friday, it filed a misdemeanor complaint against the
company alleging destruction of the streambed.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior Court's Newhall branch
alleges that the company changed "the banks, bed and channel of an
unnamed tributary of the Santa Clara River" south of California 126
and west of Interstate 5.</TE>
<TE>   Newhall Land spokeswoman Marlee Lauffer said she did not know
details of the complaint and could not comment on it.</TE>
<TE>   However, any activity on the land "absolutely wouldn't have been
related to development. We are still farming portions of the land and
have been doing that for more than 100 years," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The streambed site is not far from the bank where fewer than a
dozen Los Angeles sunflowers were found.</TE>
<TE>   After the spineflower and the Ventura marsh milk vetch, the Los
Angeles sunflower is the third plant formerly thought to be extinct
that has turned up in the county, said Steve Martarano, a spokesman
for Fish and Game.</TE>
<TE>   "There's all these places being developed now that were private
property, tucked away," Martarano said. "We're just starting to find
out what's on them."</TE>
<TE>   The housing project, now undergoing environmental review, is to be
considered by the county Board of Supervisors in January.</TE>

<HD>Disabled Call for More State Support</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California health officials have failed to provide adequate support
for disabled residents seeking to move from institutions to
mainstream housing, dozens of participants in a health forum
contended Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The state needs to spend more money on housing, transportation,
job training and personal finance programs to help disabled people
live independently, several speakers said during the forum at
Northridge Hospital Medical Center.</LD>
<LD>   "We can't afford to drag our feet on this issue," said Jack
Allison, 51, who broke his neck in a diving accident a decade ago and
uses a wheelchair. "Every day, every hour is too much time to be
spent in a nursing home."</LD>
<TE>   A 1999 U.S. Supreme Court decision calls for states to provide,
when appropriate, support for disabled people seeking to move from
institutions into mainstream housing.</TE>
<TE>   Commentary from the forum, along with other remarks gathered at
forums being held throughout the state this month, will be forwarded
to the state Department of Health and Human Services' Long-Term Care
Council. Officials must establish a statewide plan to assist disabled
people seeking independent housing by April to comply with the high
court's decision.</TE>
<TE>   The court's ruling stems from a case in Georgia, where state
officials maintained that they had the authority to decide which form
of treatment was better even when state-appointed doctors preferred
community homes over state-run facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Their policy was challenged by two mentally disabled women who
wanted to move out of the Georgia Regional Hospital in Atlanta.
Doctors at the facility agreed they were ready to leave, but state
officials refused to release them.</TE>
<TE>   "Your input today is part of the plan, it's part of the solution
and it's very important," said Eva Goetz, executive director of the
Freedom to Live Foundation, a Northridge-based nonprofit organization
that provides support to people with disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates argued that people with disabilities are consigned to
life in nursing homes and hospitals if the state fails to fund
programs that help them learn to live on their own.</TE>
<TE>   Several men and women in wheelchairs said the state doesn't need
to create a whole new set of programs to help disabled people move
into homes of their own; it merely needs to support existing
programs.</TE>
<TE>   Allison, of Northridge, said programs such as New Start Homes, a
nonprofit transitional housing program in Northridge, supported his
return to the mainstream. Today, he works in public relations for New
Start, lives alone and drives a van.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Hayes, 20, of Chatsworth, who lived in a hospital from age 2
1/2 to 12 after she contracted polio, said she knows the loneliness
and depression that come with life in an institution. The aspiring
advertising executive said she was fortunate to find transitional
housing that provided access to school, job training and
transportation.</TE>
<TE>   "Housing and transportation must be available to other people like
me," she said. "As any red-blooded American, I have the right to
fulfill my goals and dreams. In order to do that, we need funding."</TE>
<TE>   Margaret Belton, who heads an agency that provides in-home health
care for disabled clients, said the disabled must challenge
government to make sure their needs are met.</TE>
<TE>   "If we want to deinstitutionalize," she said, "we are going to
have to have a plan that reflects our needs."</TE>

<HD>Anaheim May Buy Grove Theater for $7 Million</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Council will decide Tuesday whether to use
Convention Center reserves to purchase the 1,100-seat venue. City
would hire a firm to run it.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Anaheim City Council will decide Tuesday whether to pay nearly $7
million for the Grove of Anaheim, a 1,100-seat theater in the
community's sports and entertainment district.</LD>
<LD>   The city is planning to turn over management of the Grove to a
private entertainment company, but would hold on to the prime real
estate between Edison International Field and Arrowhead Pond for
future development.</LD>
<LD>   "This is an excellent facility in a fabulous location," Mayor Tom
Daly said Friday. "It makes good sense for the city to have control
of this property."</LD>
<TE>   Anaheim originally owned the 1.25-acre site but deeded it to Ogden
Entertainment in 1997 for $1 million, on the conditions that the
company build a dinner theater and give the city first rights if it
ever tried to sell it.</TE>
<TE>   Although the property has since changed ownership and names --from
Ogden's Tinseltown to Aramark's Sun Theater to SMG's the Grove of
Anaheim--the city retained the first right of refusal.</TE>
<TE>   SMG, which mostly manages arenas and stadiums, does not own most
of its property and had been seeking a buyer for the Grove, said Greg
Smith, the city's executive director of Convention, Sports and
Entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   SMG officials headquartered in Philadelphia could not be reached
for comment Friday afternoon, but Smith said they asked city
officials whether they would like to exercise their first right of
refusal after SMG received a $6.7-million offer for the property.</TE>
<TE>   The offer was about $1 million less than the appraised value, city
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The city hopes to buy the Grove with money from Convention Center
reserves and avoid dipping into general fund revenue.</TE>
<TE>   If the deal is approved by the council, escrow is scheduled to
close Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   The city also is narrowing a list of potential companies it would
hire to manage the theater, including House of Blues, Clear Channel,
Concerts West, Nederlander and 3MK.</TE>
<TE>   Although there has been some speculation that the Grove has been
struggling because of competition from the House of Blues at Downtown
Disney, Smith said the two venues are different.</TE>
<TE>   "We signed a confidentiality [agreement] on SMG's financials, but
I can tell you it's doing fine," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Smith expects the Grove to generate between $132,000 and $1.8
million in revenue annually for the city.</TE>
<TE>   The Grove also would operate closely with the Convention Center,
with city staff encouraging associations and companies to book
special events at the theater and keep business in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, Smith said the city can preserve the possibility that
the area would become a major sports, entertainment, retail and
business district, dubbed Sportstown.</TE>
<TE>   The city also would retain control of the area around the train
station, which serves both Metrolink and Amtrak, and is scheduled for
expansion.</TE>
<TE>   "The Grove of Anaheim is one of dozens of jigsaw puzzle pieces
that make Anaheim a great destination," Smith said. "It makes good
sense to keep it online and part of the package."</TE>

<HD>2 Arrested in West Hollywood Attack</HD>
<DH>Crime: Sheriff's officials are seeking 15 more suspects who
allegedly took part in assault on two men while chanting 'Kill the
Jews!'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Authorities arrested two suspects and are looking for 15 others who
allegedly beat and kicked two men outside a West Hollywood nightclub
while chanting "Kill the Jews!" officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Booked on charges of assault with a deadly weapon and committing a
hate crime were Daoud Mohammed Mavid, 19, and Mohammed Hassan Aref,
22, both of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Each posted a $55,000 bond and was released.</LD>
<TE>   One of the two victims, Fareed Kanani, recounted the harrowing
ordeal. He and a friend, Michael Kashany, both 25, had left the
Goodbar nightclub early Sunday morning.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard footsteps," Kanani said. "I looked back, and there's
about 15 guys running toward us. They just kept coming.... It freaked
me out."</TE>
<TE>   "First, they struck me in the head and hit my ear. Another guy
grabbed me by the arms. I looked around and saw [my friend] Michael.
He was being kicked on the ground. They were screaming, 'Kill the
Jews!' " Kanani said.</TE>
<TE>   Kanani and Kashany escaped and took refuge in the nearby Sierra
Towers, a high-rise apartment house close to the West
Hollywood-Beverly Hills city line.</TE>
<TE>   Both Jewish and Muslim groups denounced the hate crime.</TE>
<TE>   Amanda Susskind, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League,
called the incident disturbing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always alarming to hear about a crime such as this.... We
applaud law enforcement for acting in this matter, and we're glad the
victims have come forward to speak about this. The community needs to
be more informed about anti-Semitism.</TE>
<TE>   "Hate of all kinds exists in the community, and we continue to
monitor and try to control it, whether it is directed at Jews or
Muslims or others," Susskind said.</TE>
<TE>   "Law enforcement has been fair in prosecuting hate crimes by the
Jewish Defense League against Muslims," said Salam al-Marayati,
director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council.</TE>
<TE>   "We should all stand as a united community against anyone who
commits a hate crime," he said, "especially that motivated by
religion, because our religions have no room for hate crimes."</TE>
<TE>   "The case is under investigation, and at this time there are no
formal charges," said Scott Millington, head of the hate crimes
section of the district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   The manager of the Goodbar nightclub, Ivan Urlich, said the
altercation apparently had grown out of a "Persian night" promotion
by the club.</TE>
<TE>   He said that both Iranian Muslims and Jews had showed up for the
well-advertised event. Urlich said there had been no trouble inside
the club.</TE>
<TE>   West Hollywood sheriff's Lt. Patrick Jordan said deputies
responded to reports of a beating in the street about 2:20 a.m.
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "Leaving the Goodbar," he said, "the victims were followed by 10
to 15 Persian males. They yelled epithets such as 'Kill the Jews.' We
arrested two people and we're still trying to identify the rest....
The victims got knocked to the ground and stomped."</TE>
<TE>   Kanani said that he and Kashany had been in the nightclub for more
than an hour. "I was a little tired," he said. "We decided to leave
before the group did, and, outside, at a bus stop, we saw this
gentleman. He said, 'We're going to kill all you ... Jews."</TE>
<TE>   "I went up to him and asked him why he would say something as
harsh as that, especially when he doesn't know who I am.... He said,
'It doesn't matter. We're going to start with you.' "</TE>
<TE>   During the attack, "they tore my shirt off, but I got away from
the guys who were holding me back, and punched a couple of the guys.
I got my friend loose. We ran toward the security guards at the
apartment house."</TE>
<TE>   Kanani said he suffered a possible broken nose and cuts and
bruises.</TE>
<TE>   A witness, John Griffeth, the president of the Sierra Towers
Homeowners Assn., said he had heard the shouts. "They were chanting,
'Kill the Jews! Kill the Jews!' I recorded it." He said the incident
lasted about 10 minutes in all.</TE>
<TE>   Griffeth and another resident of the Sierra Towers said there had
been frequent complaints about violence at or outside the Goodbar
club.</TE>
<TE>   West Hollywood City Councilman Jeff Prang said that, just this
week, the city's Business License Commission held a hearing and
decided to impose new restrictions on the club.</TE>
<TE>   Among them is a requirement that the club employ off-duty
sheriff's officers on busy nights. He said commissioners had also
declared the club would be shut down if there was more trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Ulrich said that he had tried to control occasional trouble, but
that the Persian promotion "was like three birthday parties put
together."</TE>
<TE>   "We don't ask what political stripe or religion is showing up," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Janitorial Firms Face Fraud, Theft Charges in Labor Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County district attorney's office has filed tax fraud
and grand theft charges against three Palmdale janitorial companies
and their top officials for underpaying workers and failing to pay
taxes and unemployment insurance.</LD>
<LD>   The companies failed to pay at least $900,000 in taxes and
insurance premiums to the state, prosecutors said. They said the
alleged fraud went back as far as 1997.</LD>
<LD>   Jaime Huerta and Micaela Rivera Escovedo, who own the businesses,
along with employees Jose Roman Berumen and Diana Yazmin Armenta,
pleaded not guilty Friday in Los Angeles County Superior Court. The
defendants, who were being held in county jail, were arrested after a
lengthy investigation by the district attorney's office.</LD>
<TE>   A fifth suspect, Julio Bravo, was being sought Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Huerta and Escovedo operated Sun Janitorial Professionals
Services, Speed Janitorial Services and A Janitorial Professional
Services. Berumen managed the companies and Armenta was a bookkeeper,
prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   The charges include workers' compensation fraud, grand theft of
labor, and failure to collect, account or pay tax. The defendants are
scheduled to return to court Sept. 30 for a bail review hearing.</TE>
<TE>   According to prosecutors, the subcontracting companies underbid
other companies by paying their employees far less than minimum wage
and not paying them overtime. The companies also failed to pay
unemployment insurance and disability, and did not report correct
payroll for workers' compensation insurance, said Deputy Dist. Atty.
Barry Gale.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the 517 victims were immigrants who got "cheated to a
large degree," Gale said. "It's a shock to see these people getting
$4 an hour. Certainly they don't have any hope of getting the
American dream on that."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have also been investigating Houston-based
Encompass/Building One Service Solutions for possible wage, tax and
insurance fraud involving janitors at supermarkets and discount
stores. Two of its subcontractors were convicted last year of
felonies, including "theft of labor" for underpaying their workers.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office has been working with several
agencies, including the state Employment Development Department and
Department of Insurance, and the U.S. Department of Labor in
investigating the janitorial industry.</TE>

<HD>Antelope Valley Ranchers' Killer Gets 32 to Life</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY THERMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge sentenced a man Friday to 32 years to life in state prison
for murdering two Antelope Valley ranchers, and said she would have
given Josif Jurcoane the death penalty if he had been eligible for
it.</LD>
<LD>   "To me, the defendant is a coward and a serial killer, and in my
opinion should receive the death penalty for this," Superior Court
Judge Shari K. Silver said as she imposed the maximum sentence for
the July 4, 1984 shooting deaths of Lloyd William Bryden, 67, and his
companion, Alice B. McCannel, 39.</LD>
<LD>   Jurcoane, 52, stared stonily in the San Fernando courtroom as
several friends and relatives of the victims, and even his daughter,
gave emotional speeches berating him for the killings.</LD>
<TE>   Choking back tears, Josephine Jurcoane, 22, told Silver that her
father must be punished for his actions, which included evading
arrest until last year by hiding in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "You said you thought you had paid for what you had done by being
on the road for 17 years," she angrily told her father, seated 15
feet away. Turning to the judge, she said she hoped for a heavy
sentence because "he thinks he has paid, but he hasn't."</TE>
<TE>   The judge praised the daughter for having "the courage and morals"
to testify against her father during his trial. "I view you as a
heroine," Silver said.</TE>
<TE>   Josephine Jurcoane testified for the prosecution that she
remembered the day two neighbors were killed, when she was about 4
years old.</TE>
<TE>   She said she heard gunshots and saw her father come home in his
pickup truck and hastily pack his clothes before vanishing for many
years from her life.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Jurcoane ambushed and killed the ranchers
separately on their property after his wife had a dispute with
McCannel over the ownership of some farm animals. A few weeks
earlier, he had been fired from his job at the ranch.</TE>
<TE>   A San Fernando jury convicted Jurcoane of second-degree murder in
the slayings of Bryden and McCannel, who operated the 450-acre
Mountain Brook ranch near Palmdale. Jurcoane had worked for the
couple as a mechanic and helped manage the ranch.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Rouman Ebrahim said he was barred from seeking the
death penalty by an extradition treaty with Mexico, where Jurcoane
was arrested. Jurcoane was tried on charges of first-degree murder,
but the jury reduced the charges. Silver made it clear she did not
agree with their decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have convicted you of first-degree murder in two
seconds," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The judge sentenced Jurcoane to two consecutive terms of 15 years
to life, plus two years for using a firearm.</TE>
<TE>   Madeleine Rungaitis, a friend of McCannel, faced Jurcoane in court
and said she wondered how he could look his relatives in the eye,
"knowing the evil you have done."</TE>
<TE>   "As hard as it is for your children," she said, "I am sure it will
be even harder for them to explain this to your grandchildren."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Arnold Notkoff was the only person to speak on
Jurcoane's behalf. He asked for leniency because "it seems like a
spur-of-the-moment type of thing, where something snapped."</TE>

<LD>Stung by criticism of security lapses after a series of escapes by
violent juveniles, Los Angeles County probation officials have hired
the county Sheriff's Department to review security at its juvenile
halls.</LD>
<LD>   A Sheriff's Department team will examine security procedures and
problems at the county's three main juvenile detention complexes--the
Central, Los Padrinos and Barry J. Nidorf juvenile halls--where five
teenagers have escaped so far this year, Chief Probation Officer
Richard Shumsky said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   In a Probation Department memo dated Sept. 1, Assistant Supt.
Cheryl M. Cooke said that a team of four deputies will be
interviewing staff for their perspectives on operations and policies.
In addition, inspections will focus on the exteriors of the detention
centers, including the grounds, walls, parking lots and lighting, to
analyze and minimize weaknesses, according to the memo.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors last month ordered
probation officials to come up with a plan to prevent escapes while
transferring teenagers who are tried and convicted as adults to
County Jail.</TE>
<TE>   Shumsky said the latest review was prompted, in part, by a July 31
escape in which three teenagers, two of them convicted murderers,
broke out of the Central Juvenile Hall. Officials said that incident
involved a gun that had been smuggled into the facility.</TE>
<TE>   "We have asked for sheriff's consultation in this area," Shumsky
said. "It just makes sense for us to be in contact with other
authorities, so they can see things with fresh eyes."</TE>
<TE>   In the July incident, Jose Argueta, 17, convicted in the
execution-style murder of a gang rival, asked guards to release him
from his room so he could get a drink of water. He was housed in a
special unit for the most violent inmates.</TE>
<TE>   Once outside, he produced a .45-caliber handgun and forced three
guards to release convicted murderer Marvin Sandoval, 17, and
convicted carjacker Fernando Nupiri, 18. All three remain at large.</TE>
<TE>   A week later, a 16-year-old being held at Central Juvenile Hall in
an armed robbery case escaped from custody while attending a medical
appointment at a nearby clinic. The youth, Steven Frazier, is back in
custody, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   A Probation Department report said the Central Juvenile Hall
escapes involved security lapses that included inadequate use of
metal detectors and a ladder left accessible to those in custody.</TE>
<TE>   In an earlier Probation Department report, officials found a range
of security lapses at Barry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall in Sylmar,
including the staff's failure to quickly alert authorities that
Kenneth Gilliam, a 17-year-old convicted of attempted murder, had
scaled a wall after breaking his dorm room window with a ball from a
computer mouse.</TE>
<TE>   That April report found that the hall housed its violent detainees
in quarters with inadequate security, had improperly installed door
locks and had an inoperable gate that allowed for escape.</TE>
<TE>   Probation officials said they are remedying those problems.</TE>

<LD>Residents of one of Los Angeles' oldest neighborhoods will close the
book today on a 10-year campaign to improve their community library
when they reopen it after a $3.6-million expansion.</LD>
<LD>   An airy, futuristic addition to the tile-roofed Jefferson Park
library has quadrupled its size. Along with space for 28 public
computer terminals and a classroom where adults will be taught to
read, the building includes the community's first meeting room.</LD>
<LD>   The changes are remarkable at the 79-year-old Jefferson-Vassie D.
Wright Memorial Library, where members of the Our Authors Study Club
shoved reading tables together when they met to discuss black writers
in the 1940s.</LD>
<TE>   Equally remarkable is the do-it-yourself nature of the community's
crusade to improve the place.</TE>
<TE>   The structure at 2211 W. Jefferson Blvd. was inexplicably left off
the lists of city libraries earmarked for renovation or replacement
through voter-approved bond measures in 1989 and 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Community involvement in the Jefferson Park library grew out of
the 1992 riots when real estate broker Ralph Gilmer saw a health-care
consultant, Robert Sausedo, walking door-to-door, handing out fliers
that pleaded "Don't Burn This Neighborhood!"</TE>
<TE>   The men organized a neighborhood meeting at the library to discuss
ways of improving the area so that rioting "would never happen
again," as Gilmer put it. Those taking part in the meeting quickly
found an issue to tackle: The little library did not have a public
restroom.</TE>
<TE>   The group got restrooms and a wheelchair ramp installed. Heady
with that success, it organized itself into the nonprofit Community
Empowerment Corp. and set out to get a meeting room added to the
library.</TE>
<TE>   Architect Tom Rael volunteered to draw up plans, and the group
used them to show potential donors that they were serious about the
project. By the late 1990s, it appeared that the group had wrangled a
$2.3-million donation from a Japanese car maker to pay for the
construction.</TE>
<TE>   But the funding failed to materialize. After that, the group
successfully lobbied city officials for $2.7 million in federal
community development block grant money. Later, city library
administrators contributed $960,000 that had been accumulated from
interest and project savings from the 1989 bond measure.</TE>
<TE>   Group members consulted city-contracted architects from the Santa
Monica firm of Killefer Flammang about the design of the addition.
Meeting each Tuesday night in the library's tiny reading room, they
grappled with such issues as how to apportion space between
bookshelves and computer work stations.</TE>
<TE>   The finished structure blends the Spanish-looking, circa-1923
original building and the flashy new glass and steel addition.</TE>
<TE>   "It even turned out more beautiful than I thought," said Michael
Williams, a university administrative assistant who has been part of
the 20-member group from the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   A 30-foot illuminated glass tower inscribed with the words "Keep
the Light Burning, Someone Is Coming Home" stands at the library's
entrance. It refers to advice that was given to Gilmer by a stranger
when the library fund-raising effort seemed to be at a dead end.</TE>
<TE>   Today's 10 a.m. reopening ceremony will include the unveiling of a
sign designating the new community meeting hall as the Ralph Gilmer
Room.</TE>
<TE>   Gilmer suggests that the name Community Room is appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   "If the community hadn't stood up, this library wouldn't be here
now," he said.</TE>

<HD>City Extends Hollywood-Highland Pact</HD>
<DH>Complex: Council OKs parking and other exemptions for mall.
Residents protest, saying deal violates initial conditions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite complaints from Hollywood Hills residents that the
Hollywood-Highland commercial complex is a nuisance, the Los Angeles
City Council on Friday approved an agreement with the developer
preserving its rights to operate under special rules for 20 years.</LD>
<LD>   City officials said a key provision of the development agreement
is a condition requiring the mall owner, TrizecHahn Hollywood LLC, to
do everything it can to keep the Academy Awards at the Kodak Theater
for the next two decades.</LD>
<LD>   However, opponents said, the agreement is not binding on the
awards show and protects an entertainment and shopping complex that
already is violating conditions set a couple of years ago on parking,
traffic and design.</LD>
<TE>   "The residents are getting shafted because they are not getting
what they were promised in the conditions," said John B. Murdock, an
attorney for the Hollywood Heights Assn., in testimony to the
council.</TE>
<TE>   Murdock, who has filed a lawsuit on behalf of the residents, said
that, when the city first gave planning approval to the project, it
required that there be 417 parking spaces on site for employees. He
said the requirement was later changed to allow off-site parking.</TE>
<TE>   The result is that many employees park on neighboring streets,
according to Fredrica Cooper, a resident of the area. The agreement
approved Friday does not require on-site parking.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper also said the development agreement does not protect
residents of the area from frequent closings of Orchid Alley, a major
access thoroughfare for residents, for special events held at the
Kodak Theater, such as the Latin Grammys and Academy Awards.</TE>
<TE>   "It constitutes a tremendous hardship," Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the neighbors protested that the development
agreement requires the city to honor, for 20 years, an ordinance
exempting the mall from normal billboard restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   The exemption, first approved by the council in June 2001,
"completely obliterated all of the protections provided by the
municipal code," Cooper said, adding that she fears existing signs on
the property will be joined by a cluster of new billboards.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Newman, an attorney for the developer, said the city
attorney had reviewed the project and concluded it is in compliance
with all city rules.</TE>
<TE>   Newman said Friday's agreement provides "additional teeth," to
make sure the development firm stays in compliance.</TE>
<TE>   He said the alley had been closed during recent events at the
request of the LAPD, for security reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Eric Garcetti supported the development agreement but
said he would form a task force to look at limiting the number and
kinds of events happening on Hollywood Boulevard in an effort to
address traffic and parking problems.</TE>
<TE>   He said the development agreement allows for periodic review of
compliance issues. He especially praised the agreement for promises
that the developer try to keep the Academy Awards at the Kodak
Theater.</TE>
<TE>   "This is totally a huge money maker for the city of Los Angeles,"
Garcetti said. "If we ever got to the point where they may be
leaving, I would be very worried."</TE>

<HD>Vietnam War Memorial Gives Alliance Its Due</HD>
<DH>History: After disputes and delays, the statue of American
and South Vietnamese soldiers will finally be installed in
Westminster.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A symbol of healing that itself became controversial is to be
installed Monday in Westminster: a war memorial depicting two somber
soldiers--one Vietnamese and one American--standing side by side.</LD>
<LD>   The 15-foot bronze is the centerpiece of a $1-million memorial
considered the first to honor both U.S. and South Vietnamese
soldiers. About 58,000 Americans and 300,000 South Vietnamese, the
two sides allied against the communist North Vietnamese, died in the
war.</LD>
<LD>   "This is our answer to 'the Wall' on the East Coast," said
Westminster City Councilman Frank Fry Jr., referring to the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial in the nation's capital. Fry is a World War II
veteran who proposed the Westminster memorial six years ago.</LD>
<TE>   "This war memorial has been a long time coming," he said. "It is
symbolic on many levels, but mainly [as a way] to unite the
Vietnamese and American communities."</TE>
<TE>   The 3-ton statue will be placed in the new, 1.4-acre Freedom Park,
surrounded by a black-marble fountain and flags of the United States
and the former South Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   Sculptor Tuan Nguyen also added a traditional memorial urn in
which incense will be burned. A computerized kiosk will allow
visitors to look up the names of U.S. and South Vietnamese
casualties.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted this memorial to be an emotional experience," said
Nguyen, 39, who took two years to finish the bronze. "It's a way to
pay our respects and repay the soldiers who fought for our freedom."</TE>
<TE>   The city commissioned the statue, provided the land and will
maintain the park, which officials expect to be a natural draw for
visitors to Little Saigon, the world's largest expatriate Vietnamese
community. The statue, however, was financed with donations from the
Vietnamese community.</TE>
<TE>   The cost, among other issues, contributed to four years of
bickering over the memorial. Many in the Vietnamese community
objected as the price escalated, forcing donors to contribute more
money.</TE>
<TE>   The criticism continued over early designs that included only a
U.S. flag or depicted the soldiers shaking hands on a battlefield.</TE>
<TE>   City officials and residents also argued over the location for the
memorial after some complained that it would be too visible in the
Civic Center park.</TE>
<TE>   A public reception to preview the memorial will be held tonight at
Miranda International art gallery in Laguna Beach. Vietnam War
veteran Russell Kolins was among those watching Friday as the
sculpture was moved to the gallery.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes me feel good to see this because it's more symbolic of
the way people feel about the Vietnam War now," he said. "The public
seems to understand now."</TE>
<TE>   Many are happy the project is done.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the idea is noble. A lot of the fighters in Vietnam
returned and were forgotten," said Nguyen Phuong Hung, a South
Vietnamese Army Ranger who lost two brothers in the war. "And they
received no honors, no recognition. We returned not as heroes but [as
losers] of the war," he said. "I was afraid the project might never
be completed."</TE>

<HD>A Provocative Look at Latino Art</HD>
<DH>Exhibit: Oxnard's Carnegie museum offers a show that
explores cultural roots, with works packed with social commentary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chuy Rangel lives close enough to the Carnegie Art Museum in Oxnard
that he could walk to Sunday's opening reception for the Arte y
Cultura exhibition, which will highlight the work of more than a
dozen prominent Latino artists.</LD>
<LD>   But he plans to drive instead, settling in behind the wheel of the
classic, coffee-colored Chevy Belair featured in his acrylic artwork
"Puro Inspiration Point."</LD>
<LD>   The painting, an homage to Chicano car culture, is one of seven
pieces the 31-year-old artist has loaned to the show, which kicks off
the Carnegie's fall season and is designed to peel back layers of
Latino culture and lay them bare for a wide audience to explore.</LD>
<TE>   "I would like for the audience here in Ventura County to take
advantage of the opportunity to see some of the finest Chicano art
available," said Rangel, whose artwork has been featured in galleries
from San Francisco to Scotland. "And I want [museum visitors] to be
able to engage and interact with the artwork so that, if they don't
know otherwise, they can discover what our culture is all about."</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition is part of an ongoing push by the Carnegie museum
to build up the Latino art portion of its permanent California
collection. Each fall for the past four years, museum director
Suzanne Bellah has put the permanent collection on display along with
artwork borrowed from artists and collections.</TE>
<TE>   As in previous years, this year's exhibit will also feature
educational programs, a lecture series and Mexican folk art honoring
the Day of the Dead.</TE>
<TE>   The show runs through Nov. 24 at the downtown museum, 424 South C
St. It starts Sunday at 1 p.m. with a reception that will feature a
lowrider car show and a deejay.</TE>
<TE>   "There is incredibly creative and technical work being done by
California Chicano and Latino artists," Bellah said. "This is our
opportunity to share some of it with the public."</TE>
<TE>   There will be plenty to choose from.</TE>
<TE>   From the sobering black-and-white photograph of a tattooed man in
shackles to the untitled oil on canvas of a woman in a wedding gown
contemplating the institution of marriage, much of the artwork is
packed with social commentary and is intended to provoke.</TE>
<TE>   One of Rangel's pieces, for example, is titled "Non-Union Worker"
and is meant to depict the refusal of the Chihuahua made famous by
Taco Bell to do any more commercials for the fast-food giant.</TE>
<TE>   The museum also gets an opportunity to show off its own pieces,
including a colorful, mural-sized painting depicting the history of
the Chicano movement. The piece was done by noted Latino artist Frank
Romero especially for the museum.</TE>
<TE>   Bellah said there will be a particular emphasis this year on the
work of Latina artists. The lecture series will feature artist Diane
Gamboa, Cal State Northridge instructor and artist Yreina Cervantez,
and poet Marisela Norte.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard folk-art expert Virginia Ashby Valdez also will have her
artwork on display.</TE>
<TE>   Valdez, a 46-year-old Ventura native, has been involved for years
with the museum's educational programs and its celebration of the Day
of the Dead, or Dia de los Muertos. She said she is thrilled that the
museum is taking a leading role in boosting Latino artists and
sharing Latino customs and traditions with a wide audience.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just exciting to be able to reach out to our community and
pull everyone in for this wonderful cultural experience," she said.
"There's an important Latino voice out there, and it's growing larger
all the time. It just makes sense that it should be reflected in
everything from pop culture to music to fine arts."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County judge refused Friday to dismiss murder charges
against the former business partner of slain racing legend Mickey
Thompson.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Frank F. Fasel dismissed claims by Michael
Goodwin's attorneys that prosecutors failed to produce sufficient
evidence linking him to the 1988 slayings of Thompson and wife Trudy.</LD>
<LD>   Goodwin, 57, of Dana Point, has pleaded not guilty to two counts
of murder and special-circumstance allegations of lying in wait,
murder for financial gain and multiple murders.</LD>
<TE>   The Thompsons were shot to death outside their home in Bradbury,
east of Los Angeles.</TE>

<LD>Prosecutors need more information before deciding whether to charge a
man accused of sexually assaulting a woman during an acupressure
treatment session, a representative of the district attorney's office
said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Shin Higashiura, 55, of Laguna Niguel was arrested Wednesday on
suspicion of digital penetration by fraud after a woman filed a
complaint, said Orange County sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino.
Investigators are trying to determine whether there are other
victims, he said.</LD>
<LD>   Higashiura is not a licensed physician, nor is he licensed to
offer acupuncture or acupressure treatments, Amormino said.</LD>
<TE>   Higashiura is in County Jail on an immigration hold, said Deputy
Dist. Atty. Susan Schroeder.</TE>

<HD>Deputy Badly Hurt When Bike Hits Car</HD>
<DH>Accident: Veteran is injured when his motorcycle collides
with vehicle in Mission Viejo.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County sheriff's deputy was thrown from his motorcycle and
critically injured Friday after colliding with a car in a Mission
Viejo intersection.</LD>
<LD>   Matthew Davis, 38, a 16-year veteran of the department, was taken
to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center.</LD>
<LD>   He was reported in grave condition and was undergoing surgery for
major head trauma, said department spokesman Jim Amormino.</LD>
<TE>   Davis is married and has three young children, Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Davis was southbound behind another vehicle on
Marguerite Parkway at La Sierra Drive about 12:30 p.m. when he
collided with a Saturn turning left from eastbound La Sierra onto
northbound Marguerite.</TE>
<TE>   The impact threw the officer off his bike and lofted him about 20
feet into a traffic sign, Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   The motorcycle kept going for about 100 feet before jumping a
center divider and stopping in the oncoming lane.</TE>
<TE>   The driver of the Saturn--a 17-year-old girl--had come to a full
stop at a stop sign before starting her left turn, Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis did not have a stop sign, Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   Amormino said the driver may not have seen the motorcycle because
of the vehicle that preceded it into the intersection.</TE>
<TE>   "She definitely stopped," he said. "We're not sure what charges,
if any, will be filed."</TE>
<TE>   The girl--whose name was not released because of her age--was not
injured, Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   The accident remains under investigation.</TE>

<LD>That's something, isn't it--the disclosure that L.A.'s film-promotion
agency donated $10,000 to a Pittsburgh movie commission?</LD>
<LD>   I mean, what's Pittsburgh ever done for L.A.?</LD>
<LD>   I remember when a Pittsburgh mayor by the name of Sophie Masloff
visited here several years ago and commented: "The experts told me
the city of L.A. was the city of the future. What a bunch of
baloney."</LD>
<TE>   Then there was the time the Allegheny County (Pa.) coroner turned
down an opening for the L.A. County coroner's job. His wife said of
L.A.: "Everything looks like a slum. I understand there is a drought,
but people can at least rake their yards."</TE>
<TE>   As if that isn't enough, the Pittsburgh Pirates let slugger Barry
Bonds slip away to the San Francisco Giants, the Dodgers' rival.</TE>
<TE>   Rake up that $10,000 and give it back, Pittsburgh!</TE>
<TE>   Hanging offense: In a Laughlin, Nev., hotel room, Mike and Peggy
Bird of Calabasas noticed a warning for clothes hounds next to a
sprinkler on the wall (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   One-stop shopping: With summer coming to an end, Kathy Yagami of
Newbury Park found a store supplying the necessary before-and-after
equipment for skiers (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Even the roosters sleep late in Laguna: The police log of the
Coastline Pilot said "loud roosters were reported in the 31000 block
[of Catalina Avenue] at 2:32 p.m."</TE>
<TE>   Mixed reviews: A couple of L.A. hotels have received attention in
the national media.</TE>
<TE>   USA Today, in a piece on how tourists are being hit with hidden
charges, noted that the room service menu at the Century Plaza Hotel
lists a cheeseburger at a mere $14. But when delivery charges,
administrative fees and tips are added, it comes to $21.44. No extra
charge for onions, though!</TE>
<TE>   The Wall Street Journal, meanwhile, praised the concierge service
at The Grove at Farmers Market, whose staff successfully carried out
10 of 12 requests by a Journal reporter, the most important being the
procuring of a velvet painting of Elvis Presley.</TE>
<TE>   I'm sure Elvis would be pleased to be in an item that mentioned
cheeseburgers.</TE>
<TE>   A business exec who's trimming expenses? The police log of the
Dana Point News said: "Pacific Coast Highway, 34200 block ... The
front desk of the Holiday Inn Express reported that a subject was
found sleeping in one of their conference rooms. 6:49 a.m."</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: The covers of men's magazines feature pretty girls.
Those of sports magazines show athletes. And what's on the cover of a
lawyer's magazine, like the L.A. publication Advocate? Why, a lawsuit
in the making, of course (see accompanying).</TE>

<HD>Finalist for LAPD Job, Lopez Awaits Interview With Hahn</HD>
<DH>Search: Colleagues of the Oxnard police chief say he'd be a
perfect fit in Los Angeles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT, TIMOTHY HUGHES and DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez, flush from making the short list of
candidates for top cop in Los Angeles, accepted a flood of
congratulatory calls Friday and prepared for a meeting with Los
Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn.</LD>
<LD>   "I've had so many calls from people expressing their support I had
to turn off my pager," Lopez said.</LD>
<LD>   As for his 9 a.m. interview with Hahn on Monday, Lopez said he
asked a friend what he should do to prepare. "He said, 'You've
prepared for 31 1/2 years as a police officer.' "</LD>
<TE>   Still, Lopez said he plans to crystallize comments about what he
considers his strongest selling point--leadership in community
policing--while preparing proposals on what Hahn has said are his
goals for the Los Angeles Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said that he never really expected to make the final cut.</TE>
<TE>   "It was one of those things where you always hope, but taking into
consideration the number of top law enforcement officers from around
the U.S. that were in contention, I really was surprised," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez joins former Philadelphia Police Commissioner John Timoney
and former New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton on the
list of names forwarded to Hahn for consideration.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement Thursday that Lopez made the final three
candidates of 13 finalists for chief of the LAPD delighted--but
didn't necessarily surprise--his colleagues and peers across Ventura
County.</TE>
<TE>   Dist. Atty. Michael Bradbury and Sheriff Bob Brooks said they
think Lopez, 52, is a perfect fit for the LAPD post, mostly because
of his 28 years within that department and his knack for reaching
into the communities he serves to calm fears and form consensus.</TE>
<TE>   "He's building on a very strong career in Los Angeles," Brooks
said. "A lot of people there know him as a person and they know his
work."</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard city officials said they'd hate to see Lopez go but would
be proud if he got the job.</TE>
<TE>   "After competing against such elite candidates . . . it's really
phenomenal," Oxnard Mayor Pro Tem John Zaragoza said after the
announcement. "He has done a great job for the city since he arrived
in 1998, and I'd hate to lose him. But he'd do a great job down
there."</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard City Manager Ed Sotelo said he was surprised by the
announcement, but that he also believed Lopez "had just as good a
chance as the others" to make the cut.</TE>
<TE>   "He's an excellent chief and has done some really good work for
the city," Sotelo said.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard City Councilman Tom Holden said he has thought all along
that Lopez had a good shot at the position. "He's an asset to our
community and you can't wish him anything but success," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez has been criticized by the Oxnard City Council for his
response to an outbreak of gang violence in the fall of 2000 and for
officers' inability to deal effectively with mentally ill suspects
that critics tied to five fatal shootings by Oxnard police last year.</TE>
<TE>   But Lopez said he heard the criticisms and reacted by cracking
down with a massive anti-gang presence on the streets and by
immediately ordering more training on helping officers learn to
handle emotionally disturbed suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Other top city and law enforcement officials said Lopez should be
credited for expanding the city's community policing efforts by
assigning officers to specific neighborhoods, including the
high-crime La Colonia. He was also praised for helping cut crime,
which fell about 50% in Oxnard in the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez is respected by many of his 200-officer force in Oxnard
because of his big-city police background.</TE>
<TE>   Officer Ramiro Holguin, 33, said Lopez is an easy person to talk
with and that he had approached him on several occasions without an
appointment.</TE>
<TE>   "He was open and attentive, and that's the first thing you look
for in a supervisor," Holguin said.</TE>
<TE>   An indication of Lopez's popularity was the response of the
rank-and-file as the officers watched their boss being announced as a
finalist.</TE>
<TE>   The station briefing room erupted in cheers when the announcement
was made, said Officer Greg Harasymowycz, 25.</TE>
<TE>   "He really was a part of bringing community-oriented policing into
the department," Harasymowycz said. "That'll be something he'll bring
to L.A. .... I think he is exactly what L.A. needs."</TE>

<HD>HP Charity to Cut Staff, Slash Grants</HD>
<DH>Giving: Declines in the stock market ravage the Packard
Foundation's endowment, which has shrunk to $3.8 billion from $15
billion in 2000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Coming to grips with a massive decline in the value of
Hewlett-Packard Co. stock, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation
said Friday that it will cut as many as half its 160 staffers and
further reduce its charitable grants.</LD>
<LD>   The endowment of the 38-year-old Los Altos foundation, which
little more than two years ago was worth $15 billion and second only
to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in size, has dwindled to
$3.8 billion, the group said.</LD>
<LD>   More than 70% of the endowment is in HP stock, which has dropped
from above $68 in 2000 to $12.94 Friday. An additional 15% is in
shares of Agilent Technologies Inc., an HP spinoff that has lost more
than half its value since a 1999 initial public offering.</LD>
<TE>   Begun by HP co-founder David Packard and his wife, the foundation
has been by far the largest private donor in Silicon Valley and
neighboring counties, funding everything from hospitals to arts
education in elementary schools. It has also won wide praise for the
strategic planning behind its giving.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, it pioneered funding to improve the
effectiveness of nonprofits, instead of just throwing dollars at
worthy causes. After soul-wrenching board discussions, the Packard
Foundation will drop two of its six major programs, philanthropic
effectiveness and arts funding.</TE>
<TE>   A third big program area, science, will be merged with
conservation. The foundation will continue its programs focusing on
population planning and on "children, families and communities."</TE>
<TE>   The amount of money given out next year will drop to $200 million
from $250 million this year, far short of the $451 million it
dispensed in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The cutbacks at the Packard Foundation are among the sharpest by a
big donor in recent years. But the stock market drop has hit many
other funders, and deserving organizations are suffering nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   In nearby Los Gatos, the Valley Foundation cut its awards about
15% this year and expects to trim at least that much again next year.
In Atlanta, the Robert W. Woodruff Foundation, whose fortune stems
from the Coca-Cola Co., reduced its grant pool by $10 million in the
last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Other endowments with less exposure to the stock market have done
much better--including the $24-billion Gates Foundation, which has no
Microsoft Corp. stock.</TE>
<TE>   The divergence has driven a debate about diversifying holdings,
especially at trusts where so much rides on a single company's
fortune.</TE>
<TE>   But Jan Masoaka, executive director of a Packard beneficiary
called CompassPoint Nonprofit Services, said she admired the group
for respecting the wishes of David Packard, who died in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "For better or worse, it connects the foundation with the company
that created the wealth of the fund. This money didn't fall out of
the sky on David Packard's head," Masoaka said. "The point is
honoring the instructions of the founder and his belief they should
be connected to one another."</TE>
<TE>   The Packard Foundation has tried to soften the blow by stretching
out dollars over multiyear periods and by giving away a greater
percentage of its endowment than it would normally, said spokesman
Chris DeCardy.</TE>
<TE>   The organization held onto its staff last year to better manage
the funding it had left while hoping that the economy and technology
stocks would recover. And it voted its HP shares against
Hewlett-Packard's controversial acquisition of Compaq Computer Corp.,
which has continued to depress HP's stock since the deal closed.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't know what was going to happen with the endowment and
with the market," DeCardy said. "This is not going to be one of those
V-shaped recessions, so for the long term, we need to make that
internal adjustment."</TE>
<TE>   The worst part is that the cutbacks come when beneficiaries need
it most. Just as the fizzling economy is deepening people's need for
help, contributions are drying up from big philanthropic groups,
individuals made wealthy by the market and government agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really a quadruple-whammy," DeCardy said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the foundation's grant recipients said they were saddened
but unsurprised by the turn of events, given HP's decline.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very unfortunate," said Eric Heitz, president of the China
Sustainable Energy Program, which is using $8 million this year for
initiatives to reduce China's dependence on coal. "Packard was really
involved in creative philanthropy on a large scale."</TE>

<HD>Valley Mayoral Hopefuls Differ on District Split</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mayoral candidates on the San Fernando Valley secession ballot
differed Friday over whether an independent Valley should immediately
seek a breakup of the school district, or give the district more time
to reform itself.</LD>
<LD>   Mel Wilson, a Realtor running for Valley mayor, said at a Canoga
Park news conference that one of his first priorities would be to
change state law to make it easier for the Valley to carve its own
district out of the school system.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles Unified School District "has repeatedly failed our
children despite years of half-hearted attempts and numerous chances
for real reform," Wilson said. "The school district just has too many
flaws to it. It's too large and it's unmanageable."</LD>
<TE>   In interviews, other candidates said they may support breaking up
LAUSD under certain conditions, though several said Wilson's proposal
is premature.</TE>
<TE>   "Breaking it up would not be my first priority," candidate Bernie
Bernal, a union activist, said. He said he would appoint a school
czar to improve classroom instruction, and push to bring prayer to
classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   If such steps failed, Bernal added, he would support breaking up
the district.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge), also running for Valley
mayor, said his school reform plan includes the appointment of a
mayoral liaison to the district. If the district did not improve
within two years, Richman said, he would seek a breakup.</TE>
<TE>   But Richman said it would be too much to try to split the district
right after a new city is authorized.</TE>
<TE>   "We will have our work cut out for us putting in place a new city
government," Richman said of the months after the Nov. 5 secession
vote. "It's not prudent to do both at the same time."</TE>
<TE>   Candidate Jim Summers, a Realtor associate, said Friday he wants
the region to have its own school district, but is uncertain how fast
that could be accomplished.</TE>
<TE>   David Hernandez, an insurance adjuster and candidate, said
breaking up the district should be "an intermediate or long-term
goal" of a Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley and Hollywood cityhood bids have nothing to do with the
school district. Secession supporters, however, say creating Valley
and Hollywood cities would give those areas the clout to eventually
leave the school district.</TE>
<TE>   Last year the State Board of Education blocked an attempt to split
the Valley off from the school district. The board denied a request
by a group of Valley residents to set a districtwide election on a
breakup. Such an election would be required even if Valley cityhood
wins. The same is true for Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Gene La Pietra, leader of the Hollywood secession
movement, said Friday he has spent about $1.4 million of his own
money on the effort so far. He has repeatedly said he would spend
"whatever it takes" to win Hollywood's independence.</TE>
<TE>   Recent expenditures have paid for cable television and radio
advertising, as well as mailers, he said. The campaign plans to send
out 10 mailers between now and Oct. 2, La Pietra said.</TE>

<HD>Plant's Oxnard Neighbors Smell Trouble Despite Assurances</HD>
<DH>Sanitation: District's plans to use an idled waste
treatment facility run afoul of residents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With neighbors that include two sewage plants, a mushroom farm and a
wood-recycling plant, folks in the South Bank area of north Oxnard
have endured nauseating smells for years.</LD>
<LD>   So when the Ventura Regional Sanitation District closed one of two
nearby waste treatment facilities in July, residents literally
breathed easier.</LD>
<LD>   But now the Montalvo Municipal Improvement District, which owns
the property with the treatment facilities, plans to process an
increased amount of waste from the idled system.</LD>
<TE>   Oxnard residents and officials would prefer the entire Montalvo
site be totally shut down and its pipes connected directly to the
Ventura sewer system.</TE>
<TE>   Despite assurances that Montalvo's treatment facilities would not
run any waste through Oxnard pipes or handle any restaurant oils and
greases, or human wastes, residents of the neighborhood south of the
Santa Clara River are wary the foul smells will return.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still going to be the same problem," said Travis Childress,
a South Bank resident.</TE>
<TE>   For years Childress and his neighbors had complained of a rotten
odor permeating South Bank.</TE>
<TE>   At any given time, they said, their streets can smell like rotten
eggs, grass or worse. Childress said he once had to cancel a barbecue
because the stench was intolerable.</TE>
<TE>   "These are smells that will wake you up from the dead," resident
Bert Perello said. "I guarantee you if the winds blew through
downtown Ventura and they were getting these smells, something
would've been done."</TE>
<TE>   At Tuesday's Oxnard City Council meeting, city officials
recommended the city oppose even a scaled-down version of the waste
treatment facility. "There are no provisions for odor control or
containment," said Mark Norris, the city's waste-water
superintendent.</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura Regional Sanitation District has postponed a search
for another site for a liquid waste treatment facility. It had
considered plans to use the plant to receive some of the Saticoy
district's waste, but has not made a decision, sanitation district
Chairman David Bury said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're waiting to take future action based on the results of an
odor study," Bury said.</TE>
<TE>   Bury said the sanitation district had planned to close the
facility next year, but that complaints from area residents forced
them to move more quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the smell was traced to a pipe that carried partly treated
waste from the district's waste treatment facility in Montalvo to
Oxnard's sewage system.</TE>
<TE>   Sewer pipes in north Oxnard, which serve mostly residences, are
too small to handle the extra waste from the Liquid Waste Treatment
Facility. So that waste was moved at night when household use was at
a minimum.</TE>
<TE>   This, in turn, caused smelly liquid waste to sit all day inside
the pipeline and produce gases such as hydrogen sulfide, which can
cause eye irritation, sore throats and coughing, shortness of breath,
headaches, memory loss, or even death under high exposure.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Polk, district manager for the Montalvo Municipal
Improvement District, assured South Bank residents at a meeting
Wednesday that the treatment facility would handle only certain
wastes and there would be no odor.</TE>
<TE>   "Immediate priority will be taken to ensure that there are no
odors emanating from here," Polk said. "There's no reason you should
have to live with odors."</TE>
<TE>   Polk said he was uncertain of the Montalvo district's next move
until the sanitation agency makes a final decision on where to place
a treatment facility or whether it will accept Saticoy's waste.</TE>
<TE>   Engineers hired by Oxnard recently collected air samples to
determine the source of the stench. The results showed California
Wood Recycling in Oxnard, Pictsweet Mushroom Farm in Ventura, the
waste-water treatment plant in Ventura and the Montalvo plant may all
partly be at fault.</TE>

<HD>Inmate in Stun Belt Suit Dies Before Release</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A convicted thief who sued Los Angeles County after he was jolted
with an electric stun belt in court, has died in Vacaville only hours
before paperwork was completed to free him from prison, his lawyer
said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Ronnie Hawkins, 52, was serving 25 years to life when he died at a
state prison Thursday, attorney Stephen Yagman said.</LD>
<LD>   Hawkins, who had AIDS, was waiting to be released after a federal
judge ruled that his 1998 three-strikes sentence for stealing $250
worth of painkillers was too harsh.</LD>
<TE>   The writ to release him was completed three hours after Hawkins
died, Yagman said.</TE>
<TE>   Hawkins was acting as his own attorney during a 1998 sentencing
hearing when he was shocked by a 50,000-volt, low-amperage stun belt
after interrupting Long Beach Superior Court Judge Joan
Comparet-Cassani.</TE>
<TE>   Hawkins sued the county, claiming the use of the belt violated his
right to a fair trial by effectively silencing him.</TE>
<TE>   In October, Hawkins agreed to settle his lawsuit over the stun
belt incident for $275,000.</TE>

<HD>California's State Fish Considered for U.S. Endangered
Species List</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long swimming in troubled waters, the California state fish is being
considered for inclusion on the federal endangered species list,
officials say.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced Friday that it will
conduct a 12-month study on what protections should be made for the
California golden trout, a brilliant gold and red-orange-colored fish
with a deep olive-green back that has been a state symbol since 1947.</LD>
<LD>   The federal study, which could determine that the trout should be
listed as "threatened" or "endangered," is part of a settlement in a
lawsuit filed in November by Trout Unlimited, a conservation group
that accused the government of failing to protect the fish from
crossbreeding, habitat destruction from cattle grazing and other
disturbances.</LD>
<TE>   Naturalists hope the endangered designation will result in state
and federal funding efforts to keep nonnative fish from crossbreeding
with the golden trout, as well as developing methods to preserve the
trout's habitat.</TE>
<TE>   The only pure strain of wild California golden trout is found in
just two mountain streams in the Inyo National Forest in Tulare
County.</TE>
<TE>   Its "genetic integrity" has been diluted by years of "careless
stocking of nonnative" breeds such as rainbow and brown trout,
activists say. Look-alikes are found in many streams around the
state, but they are hybrids.</TE>
<TE>   Trout Unlimited spokesman Allan Moore said Friday that he was
relieved by the government's decision.</TE>
<TE>   "When a species gets to this point, there's nothing to celebrate,"
he said. "We're pleased people recognize that this species merits
some kind of protection to stave off its extinction."</TE>
<TE>   There are 517 species of animals and 743 species of plants on the
list, created by the federal Endangered Species Act. In addition,
there are 71 domestic fish and 11 foreign species included on the
endangered list.</TE>
<TE>   Ordered by U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker, the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service conducted a 90-day review of evidence presented by
Trout Unlimited, and as a result has decided to further study the
matter.</TE>
<TE>   "We have found in a review of the science and in talking with
other agencies and stakeholders that there is substantial evidence
suggesting that this listing may be warranted," said spokesman Jim
Nickles.</TE>
<TE>   Before agency officials decide to push for an endangered listing
for the golden trout, they also must seek public comment.</TE>
<TE>   Trout Unlimited requested an endangered listing for the golden
trout in 2000 but did not hear from the government.</TE>
<TE>   "We're disinclined to litigate," Moore said. "But we were left
with no options."</TE>
<TE>   Jacob Martin, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife biologist, said the agency
is so strapped for funds that it can't pay attention to all worthy
causes in a timely manner.</TE>
<TE>   "We would have liked to have put out a finding a long time ago,"
he said. "But there is so much going on with us, some things just
don't get done on time."</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the California golden trout, a subspecies of the
rainbow trout, did not have its habitat frozen over in the most
recent ice age.</TE>
<TE>   "Isolated for eons, this species has evolved distinct
characteristics, such as its unique color," Martin said.</TE>
<TE>   Now the species is native to just the south fork of the Kern River
and Golden Trout Creek, in the rugged Eastern Sierra just south of
Mt. Whitney. The species is secure in less than 5% of its original
habitat, officials estimate.</TE>
<TE>   "What's most striking is that the range of this fish has been
reduced to this small dot up in the rugged Sierra," Moore said. "And
to us, that's worth protecting."</TE>
<TE>   Livestock grazing continues to damage habitat. Despite the removal
in 2001 of cattle owned by beer maker Anheuser-Busch, other herds
remain in the area. "It's still a big problem," said Scott Yates,
director of Trout Unlimited's western native trout program.</TE>
<TE>   Introduced nonnative trout have bred with the golden trout, and if
the crossbreeding pattern continues, the species will be hybridized.
In a practice experts call "bucket biology," nonnative fish and eggs
from the Western Sierra have been transplanted by recreational
fishermen to the golden trout's habitat.</TE>
<TE>   In the wild, the fish--which grow to 7 or 8 inches--have struggled
to survive, because their brighter coloring betrays them to
predators.</TE>
<TE>   Fish hatcheries--introduced in recent generations to increase the
number of catchable fish for High Sierra outdoor enthusiasts--pose
the greatest threat of hybridization.</TE>
<TE>   "The hatchery process is an ongoing experiment, and we're learning
that it can be, at times, a tremendous hindrance to nature," Moore
said. "More isn't always better."</TE>
<TE>   Responded Nickles, of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service: "Our
priorities are different now than they were 30 years ago, when we
wanted to increase fishing in many outlying areas."</TE>

<HD>Police Search High School for Gunman</HD>
<DH>Whittier: Students are kept in their classrooms after girl
reports being accosted in a restroom. No suspect is found.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 2,000 Whittier High School students were confined to their
classrooms for several hours Friday after a student reported that she
had been accosted by a gunman in a restroom.</LD>
<LD>   No one was hurt, and police failed to find the suspect during a
three-hour search of the campus.</LD>
<LD>   Whittier police said the incident occurred shortly before 11 a.m.</LD>
<TE>   A female student told security guards that a man had placed a gun
in her mouth when she walked into a science building lavatory.</TE>
<TE>   Lori Gold, a community relations coordinator for Whittier police,
said the student, who was not identified, had reported that the man
demanded she obtain some sort of property for him.</TE>
<TE>   "He told her he would kill the next person who entered the
restroom if she didn't comply," Gold said.</TE>
<TE>   The man then released the girl, and she fled.</TE>
<TE>   School officials called police and closed down the campus until 2
p.m., confining about 2,200 students to their classrooms while police
and sheriff's deputies scoured the grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Although the female student was the only witness, authorities said
her account was believable.</TE>
<TE>   As the search was conducted, hundreds of parents waited outside
the school for news of what had happened.</TE>
<TE>   Students were not allowed to leave their classrooms for a drink of
water or to use the lavatories.</TE>
<TE>   "We could do nothing. There was no water and no food," said
16-year-old sophomore Melissa Felt.</TE>
<TE>   Julie James, 38, of Whittier said she had problems trying to reach
her 15-year-old son, Ryan, when she came to school to drop off a note
for him.</TE>
<TE>   She parked her car in the parking lot, where it was blocked by
police cruisers and other parents' cars. She said she finally had to
walk home.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a scary day for parents as well as students," James said.
"They would not allow us to go into the school, and we had to wait
outside."</TE>

<LD>The Oakland Athletics clinched their third consecutive playoff berth
as Jermaine Dye hit a tiebreaking sacrifice fly in the eighth inning
to help defeat the Texas Rangers, 4-2, Friday night at Oakland.</LD>
<LD>   The victory and Seattle's 8-1 loss to the Angels guaranteed at
least a wild-card berth for the A's, who won the American League West
in 2000 and got the wild card with 102 victories last season.</LD>
<LD>   Oakland's late rally was keyed by All-Star shortstop Alex
Rodriguez's two errors on the same play. With Mark Ellis on first
base, Rodriguez bobbled Miguel Tejada's grounder for the first error,
then threw the ball past Michael Young into right field, allowing the
runners to advance to second and third. After Danny Kolb (3-5)
intentionally walked Eric Chavez, Dye hit a fly ball to deep center,
easily scoring Ellis. Reliever Juan Alvarez then walked David Justice
and Randy Velarde, scoring Tejada with the A's second unearned run of
the inning.</LD>
<TE>   Boston 4, Baltimore 2--Mike Bordick set a major league record with
his 102nd consecutive errorless game at shortstop, but Derek Lowe
earned his 21st win for the Red Sox at Baltimore. Bordick broke the
record set by Rey Ordonez with the New York Mets in 1999-2000.</TE>
<TE>   New York 5, Detroit 1--Alfonso Soriano drove in his 100th run as
the Yankees cut their magic number to one for their fifth consecutive
AL East title with a win at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 10, Minnesota 2--Carlos Lee hit a three-run homer as the
White Sox scored nine runs off Twin relievers after starter Rick Reed
left in the fifth inning because of a left knee injury.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 11, Toronto 7--Tanyon Sturtze stopped his four-game
losing streak for the Devil Rays at St. Petersburg, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 6, Kansas City 2--Ellis Burks and Jim Thome hit
consecutive home runs in the first inning as the Indians won at
Kansas City, Mo.</TE>

<HD>Angels Are Ready to Lift a Great Wait</HD>
<DH>Baseball: They beat Seattle, 8-1, and can clinch first
playoff berth in 16 years with another victory today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>For so many summers, the ritual was painfully familiar. Garret
Anderson played left field for the Angels. Tim Salmon played right
field. September would end, and so would the Angels' season. The two
men would shake hands, wish each other well and hope the next season
would be a better one.</LD>
<LD>   Wait till next year? This is the Angels' year, and today could be
the day.</LD>
<LD>   No current major league player has waited longer than Salmon to
play in October. And, other than Salmon, no current player has spent
his career with one team and waited longer than Anderson to play in
October.</LD>
<TE>   The old pros took matters into their own hands Friday. Salmon got
the Angels on the scoreboard with a home run in the first inning,
Anderson put them ahead to stay with a home run in the third, and the
Angels sliced their magic number to one with an 8-1 victory over the
Seattle Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   Years of frustration and weeks of anticipation have come down to
this: Win, and they're in. With a victory today, the Angels clinch
their first playoff berth in 16 years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like waiting for Christmas," Salmon said.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Yankees and Atlanta Braves include the playoffs on
their calendar every year, just like Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   "I've looked at guys like Chipper Jones and Derek Jeter. Every
year, it's the same," Salmon said. "You start to wonder if it's still
special to them or if they start taking it for granted.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be special for me. It's everything I've ever played
for and worked for."</TE>
<TE>   Rookie John Lackey, too young to fully appreciate the journey,
starts for the Angels today. When John Candelaria started the Angels'
last playoff game, in 1986, Lackey was 7.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon replaced Von Hayes as the Angels' right fielder in 1992.
Anderson got his first major league hit, off Ron Darling, in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always nice to win with the organization you came up with,"
Anderson said. "We've endured a lot of stuff."</TE>
<TE>   And so, even with the Angels one game behind the Oakland Athletics
in the American League West, Manager Mike Scioscia said he would
grant his players a temporary respite from the focus on the division
title upon clinching a playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to celebrate achievement," he said. "There's so
much effort and energy that goes into it."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the Angels celebrated the brilliance of Ramon Ortiz,
who held the Mariners to one run over seven innings to win his fifth
consecutive start. Ortiz (15-9) joins Jarrod Washburn in giving the
Angels two 15-game winners for the first time since Chuck Finley and
Mark Langston won 16 apiece in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   But Anderson and Salmon were the ones in the spotlight, and
deservedly so. Walk around the clubhouse, and plenty of guys can tell
you about the Mariners clinching in the Angels' faces here last year.
Anderson and Salmon can tell you about the Mariners clinching in the
Angels' faces here in 1995, in the Kingdome, after the Angels had
coughed up an 11-game lead and then lost a one-game playoff to Randy
Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon will be happy to hand this tag to David Segui of the
Orioles: Most career games without a playoff appearance. Anderson
ranks fourth on that list, behind Salmon, Segui and Jeff Cirillo of
the Mariners, one game ahead of Todd Hundley of the Cubs.</TE>
<TE>   But Segui also has played for Montreal, Seattle, Toronto, Texas
and Cleveland. Cirillo stopped in Milwaukee and Colorado before
landing in Seattle. Dodger fans can count Hundley as one of their
own, but so can Met fans and Cub fans.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon never left, signing a four-year contract extension in 1997
and another last year. Anderson never left, signing a four-year
contract extension in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   For all the days they wondered whether they would eventually have
to choose between playing in October or playing for the Angels, today
could be the day that rewards them. Turns out it was not one or the
other.</TE>

<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Aaron Sele, who has not pitched in five weeks because of a partially
torn rotator cuff, could start a game during the final weekend of the
regular season. The Angels aren't going to jeopardize their playoff
preparations to accommodate Sele, but they wouldn't mind getting him
a few innings next weekend.</LD>
<LD>   They have all but ruled out trying the lifelong starter in relief.
"That's not our preference," Manager Mike Scioscia said. "That's
putting him in a precarious position."</LD>
<LD>   Sele pitched his second simulated game Friday and is scheduled to
throw another Tuesday. Mickey Callaway, who replaced Sele in the
rotation and made five starts, said he was told Friday he would pitch
in relief the rest of the season.</LD>

<TE>   Angel playoff tickets go on sale today at 9 a.m. at Edison Field,

<TE>   For those wondering how the Angels can consider including
September callup/phenom Francisco Rodriguez on a playoff roster: To
be eligible, players must be on the 25-man major league roster or on
the disabled list Aug. 31. But if one of the players on the playoff
roster is injured, the team can substitute a player in the
organization on Aug. 31, when Rodriguez was at triple-A Salt Lake.
Should they wish to include Rodriguez, they could turn in a playoff
roster with an injured player and substitute Rodriguez for him. The
Angels currently have two players on the disabled list, Sele and
pitcher Steve Green.</TE>

<HD>Royal Coach Denies Exchange</HD>

<AU>ROB FERNAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tom Gamboa, the Kansas City Royal coach who was attacked by two fans
Thursday night during a game in Chicago, denied Friday that he had an
exchange with the bare-chested father and son before they slammed him
to the ground.</LD>
<LD>   "I have never at any time ever verbally or physically acknowledged
the people in the stands," said Gamboa, a Los Angeles native and
former minor league manager with the Dodgers.</LD>
<LD>   Gamboa, who said he would not be afraid to return to Comiskey, did
not enjoy the limelight: "It's like I'm today's Kato Kaelin. Ten
years from now, somebody will point to me and say, 'That's the guy
who was attacked.' Nobody likes to be remembered for that."</LD>
<TE>   The father, identified by police as 34-year-old William Ligue Jr.,
and his 15-year-old son were led off the field at Comiskey Park in
handcuffs. The elder Ligue was charged with aggravated battery, a
felony, and was scheduled to appear in court today. His son was
charged with two juvenile counts of aggravated battery for attacking
Gamboa and hitting a White Sox security guard, an off-duty police
officer. The teenager is being held in a juvenile detention center
and is due in court Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Ligue and his family told a law enforcement source that Gamboa
verbally responded to their insults and made an obscene gesture
before they attacked him in the ninth inning. "He got what he
deserved," said Ligue, who has past convictions for burglary and
domestic battery. About the time of the seventh inning, Ligue called
a female relative on a cell phone and asked if she was watching the
game. When she could not find the channel, he said, "Well then, just
watch the news," the source said.</TE>
<TE>   The Royals rushed to the aid of Gamboa, 54, who escaped with a few
cuts and a bruised cheek. White Sox outfielder Aaron Rowand said he'd
seen a folded-up pocket knife fall out of one of the fans' pockets.</TE>
<TE>   Said Gamboa: "The only thing that's really got me upset even more
than the incident itself is the charge that there was something going
on between us."</TE>
<TE>   Gamboa, a graduate of Notre Dame High in Sherman Oaks and UC Santa
Barbara, is in his second year as a coach with the Royals. He spent
the 2000 season as manager of the Albuquerque Dukes.</TE>
<TE>   Brother John Doran, 81, a former teacher at Notre Dame High,
recalled that Gamboa was a standout first baseman at the school and
later coached baseball at St. John Bosco High in Bellflower.</TE>
<TE>   "Tom is a good person," Doran said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just ridiculous. What's next? ... Players and coaches seem
to be in danger these days."</TE>
<TE>   A baseball official said the major leagues would look into whether
security changes need to be made.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Andy Roddick and James Blake are running out of chances to change the
United States' luck on the red clay of Roland Garros.</LD>
<LD>   The Americans skidded and tumbled on their way to singles defeats
Friday at the home of the French Open, leaving their team down 0-2 in
the Davis Cup semifinals and in need of a comeback in the
best-of-five competition.</LD>
<LD>   Roddick lost first, 4-6, 7-6 (6), 7-6 (5), 6-1, to Arnaud Clement.
Blake followed with a 6-4, 6-1, 6-7 (7), 7-5 loss to Sebastien
Grosjean. It was the first loss in Davis Cup competition for both
Americans, who returned to the locker room coated in red dirt and
feeling miserable.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm extremely disappointed that I lost," Roddick said. "Grand
Slams, it's for yourself; it's almost selfish. Here, I'm playing for
a whole team and a whole country. It goes a lot deeper."</TE>
<TE>   Russia also took a 2-0 lead in its Davis Cup semifinal against
Argentina, as Marat Safin and Yevgeny Kafelnikov won their matches in
Moscow. Safin defeated Juan Ignacio Chela 6-7 (1), 7-5, 7-5, 6-1, and
Kafelnikov beat Gaston Gaudio, 3-6, 7-5, 6-3, 2-6, 8-6.</TE>
<TE>   The United States must win the last three matches to reach its
first Davis Cup final since 1997. The Americans have won the Cup a
record 31 times, but their last title was in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   France's Fabrice Santoro and Michael Llodra are scheduled to play
Todd Martin and Mardy Fish, who have never played together in
competition, in doubles today with reverse singles matches Sunday.</TE>

<HD>Mother Fears Dabord Attempted Suicide</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE and JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not even allowed to touch her son's face, Patricia Phillips stood at
Miles Dabord's bedside in a San Diego hospital Friday, wondering if
she would ever know what happened to him and his brother.</LD>
<LD>   She said she believes he was somehow responsible for the
disappearance and presumed death of her other son, former NBA player
Bison Dele, and two others. She added she feared he had attempted
suicide in a fit of guilt, perhaps sending himself into a
drug-induced coma.</LD>
<LD>   It didn't matter. She is still his mother.</LD>
<TE>   "I wanted to hug him, to stroke his face, to hold his hand," she
said. Sheriff's deputies wouldn't allow it. "It was heart wrenching
to see him like that."</TE>
<TE>   Dabord, also known as Kevin Eugene Williams, was identified from
fingerprints Thursday, nearly a week after he was discovered
unconscious in Tijuana, naked save for a pair of white socks.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, he lay unconscious and hooked up to a respirator at
Scripps Memorial Hospital in Chula Vista, under the watchful gaze of
San Diego County Sheriff's Deputies. His mother said doctors told her
he was suffering from severe brain damage caused by a lack of oxygen.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators had said they hoped Dabord, 35, would eventually
wake up and explain his brother's disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   Dele, 33, who also went by the name Brian Williams and played for
the Clippers and the Chicago Bulls before retiring in 1999, vanished
from his boat in the South Pacific in early July along with his
girlfriend, Serena Karlan, 30, and boat captain, Bertrand Saldo.
Dabord had been sailing with his brother.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, a French Polynesian police official said they
were treating the disappearances as a murder investigation and
suggested that Dabord might have been involved.</TE>
<TE>   That presumption is based on the details of a conversation Dabord
reportedly had with his girlfriend, Erica Weise.</TE>
<TE>   Weise, who spent time with Dabord on the island of Moorea, near
Tahiti, in early July, said Dabord told her there had been a fight on
the boat and all three of the people he had been traveling with had
been killed, police sources said.</TE>
<TE>   FBI special agent Josefina Regula declined to comment on whether
Dabord was suspected of murder, saying only that Dabord is "the last
person who saw his brother when they went on that boat trip. He is
someone we want to talk to."</TE>
<TE>   Dabord has not been charged with murder, but police in Arizona
issued a warrant for his arrest after he allegedly tried to buy
$152,000 in gold coins in September by forging a check from his
brother's account and using his brother's passport as identification.</TE>
<TE>   Any explanation Dabord had for that, as well as for why he
allegedly painted over the name of his brother's 55-foot catamaran,
the Hakuna Matata, registered it by a different name when it was
docked in Tahiti, and himself used an alias when he checked it in,
remained unanswered Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Dabord was released from custody in Phoenix and disappeared before
officials could further question him. FBI investigators announced
earlier this month that he was considered a fugitive and they were
looking for him in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, officials raided a hotel room in Tijuana where they
believed Dabord had stayed as recently as Sept. 10.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, he was in Tijuana after all. And, despite the
manhunt after him, he was able to cross the border undetected.</TE>
<TE>   He showed up in San Ysidro in an ambulance driven by Mexican
officials Sunday morning, according to American sources. He was
transferred to an American ambulance and driven to Scripps Memorial
Hospital, where he was checked in as a John Doe.</TE>
<TE>   Chula Vista police Sgt. Gary Ficacci said hospital officials
called his department to request that officers take fingerprints to
try and identify him.</TE>
<TE>   Ficacci said officers were told that Dabord spent eight hours in a
Mexican hospital before being transferred to the U.S. He also said
Dabord showed no obvious signs of trauma, leading officials to
believe that his coma may have been caused by a drug overdose.</TE>
<TE>   "All that stuff is a mystery because he just kind of showed up on
our doorstep," he said. Mexican police officials said they did not
know anything about the case. U.S. customs officials said they had no
record of Dabord crossing the border.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips, who rushed to the hospital Friday with her former
husband, Eugene Williams, Dabord's father, said she believes her son
may have tried to commit suicide.</TE>
<TE>   She said she asked doctors if her son's condition was caused by an
overdose, and they told her they did not know. Hospital officials
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips said she got a phone call from her son the night of Sept.
13 in which he sounded groggy and spoke of taking his own life. His
slurred, slow speech made it sound like he was "drugged," she said.</TE>
<TE>   It was his third call that week. In two other calls, he told
Phillips that he hadn't killed his brother and that he wanted her to
know this at the end of his life.</TE>
<TE>   Until last week, Phillips said she hadn't spoken to her son since
1999.</TE>
<TE>   She said she feared he did not feel as loved as his younger
brother, an NBA standout who ran with the bulls in Pamplona, won an
NBA championship with the Bulls in Chicago, flew airplanes and
captivated people even as a child with his charisma.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything that happened to Brian was so much bigger than what
happened in Miles' life," his mother said last week. "I think that
manifested in Miles to the point where he was telling himself, 'My
mother doesn't love me and she never will.' "</TE>
<TE>   But on Friday, Phillips said she tried to demonstrate how much she
did love her son, even as he lay lifeless and unresponsive.</TE>
<TE>   She said she fears her son will never wake up. "It's to the point
where you are asking yourself ... 'What is life?' " she said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, she talked to him about family, telling him how she was
going to take relatives to Disneyland.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to touch him with that, even though I couldn't touch
him," she said. "Gene [his father] was just telling him, 'I love
you.' "</TE>

<HD>Ashby Helps L.A. Sink in the West</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: Starter gets knocked out in the third inning, and
Padres enjoy the role of spoilers, 8-4.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Late Friday afternoon on the 5 Freeway, 40 miles north of San Diego,
a flat tire caused Dodger first baseman Eric Karros, on his way to
Qualcomm Stadium, to come to a grinding halt.</LD>
<LD>   How fitting.</LD>
<LD>   With a spare in place, Karros was soon on his way, but the tone of
the day had been set.</LD>
<TE>   A few hours later, it was Karros' Dodgers, needing a win against
the lowly San Diego Padres to keep pace with the San Francisco Giants
in the National League wild-card race, who came up flat, losing 8-4
to the worst team in the NL West.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers fell two games behind San Francisco, 5-1 winners over
the Milwaukee Brewers, with eight to play.</TE>
<TE>   Having just come off a tension-filled four-game series against the
Giants before packed houses in Dodger Stadium, the Dodgers came into
less-than-half-filled Qualcomm, against the nothing-to-lose Padres
and played down to the level of the opposition, much to the delight
of the crowd of 23,595.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't a matter of a letdown," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said.
"It had nothing to do with that. There was plenty of life. There was
plenty of momentum in our dugout. This is not a crippling defeat. It
is a crippling defeat if the Giants win out. I don't know about the
likelihood of that, but if they do, you just tip your cap to them. We
have to put this aside and move on. We've obviously fallen back a
game, but we have to keep on."</TE>
<TE>   Once starter Andy Ashby got shelled for five runs in the third
inning, the air seemed to go out of the Dodgers' balloon as swiftly
as it had gone out of Karros' tire.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers committed two errors, were outhit 14-10 and could have
lost by an even wider margin had the Padres not left 10 runners on
base.</TE>
<TE>   One play in the fourth inning best illustrated the level of Dodger
futility.</TE>
<TE>   With San Diego in front, 5-3, and the bases loaded with Padres
with one out, the Dodgers needed a big play to keep their southern
neighbors within sight.</TE>
<TE>   And they got it.</TE>
<TE>   For an instant.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego outfielder Gene Kingsale hit a bouncer to first. Karros
fielded it, did a 360-degree turn and fired a strike to catcher Paul
Lo Duca, who stepped on the plate for the second out.</TE>
<TE>   With Kingsale two-thirds of the way up the first base line, Lo
Duca had a clear shot at an inning-ending double play. Instead, he
threw the ball over Karros' head, allowing a run to score.</TE>
<TE>   Ashby had called his last outing--4 1/3 innings against the
Colorado Rockies in which he gave up five runs on seven
hits--"embarrassing, an absolute joke."</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't exactly holding his head up Friday, either, after an
even more devastating performance. This time, he gave up six hits and
five runs without getting a batter out in the third.</TE>
<TE>   And it wasn't a case of bad luck or bloop hits or poor fielding.
Ashby (9-13) was racked for line drive after line drive, looking more
like a batting practice pitcher than a veteran trying to keep his
team in a pennant race.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers had taken the lead in the top of the inning on a Shawn
Green run-scoring grounder.</TE>
<TE>   Then Ashby took the mound. And the Padres took aim.</TE>
<TE>   In his last 20 1/3 innings, Ashby has given up 22 runs and 34
hits.</TE>
<TE>   "We got beat in the third inning tonight," Tracy said. "That's all
there is to it. Ashby hasn't had a good start his last three or four
times out."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers climbed back into the game in the fourth inning off
San Diego starter and winner Brett Tomko (10-10) when Karros hit his
13th home run and Mark Grudzielanek his ninth, both with the bases
empty.</TE>
<TE>   But on a night when the Padres would collect six doubles and
Vazquez would tie a career high with four hits, that would not prove
to be enough.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it would have been a little optimistic to think we would
have won the last nine games," Green said, "but obviously we would
have liked to have won the first one. For some reason, they really
swing the bats well against us."</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps Green should be looking inward. Fixing a flat tire is
one thing. Fixing a flat team is quite another.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Perez Moves Up in the Rotation</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>With an off day Monday after this weekend's series against the
Padres, Dodger Manager Jim Tracy will bypass Kevin Beirne in the
rotation and come back with Odalis Perez on Tuesday against the
Colorado Rockies.</LD>
<LD>   Tracy is also considering bringing Hideo Nomo, who is pitching
tonight, back Wednesday in Andy Ashby's spot, cutting Nomo's normal
four days of rest by one.</LD>
<LD>   Tracy had speculated about bumping Ashby even before his dismal
performance in Friday's game.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not totally my decision," Tracy said. "It depends on how
[Nomo] would feel with a short rest. If he doesn't feel he could be
effective doing it, it's a moot point. Right now, he doesn't have
strong feelings either way. If and when the time comes, he may have
different feelings. We may have different feelings.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to have some sensibility. He [Nomo] has thrown 132
pitches and 113 in his last two games. The guy is a workhorse. The
question is how far we can go without pushing the envelope too much.
It may not work out. It looks good on paper, but the physical part
may just not work out."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With pitchers Kevin Brown and Kazuhisa Ishii out for the season
because of injuries and nine days remaining in the regular season,
Tracy is determined to keep his top two pitchers--Nomo and Perez--on
the mound as much as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy studies pitch counts, performance charts and consults
constantly with pitching coach Jim Colborn. But how about the
pitchers? What influence do they have? Could Tracy be talked into or
out of a decision by one of them?</TE>
<TE>   "If there is doubt in my mind," Tracy said, "if I'm teetering,
there are three pitchers I would enter into a conversation
with--Ashby, Nomo and Odalis Perez. These are veteran guys. They've
been through the wars."</TE>

<TE>   Update--All that need be said about Nomo is that Tracy wants to
use him on three days' rest. And more often if he could. The Dodgers
had their doubts about Nomo when they signed him as a free agent in
the off-season, remembering all too well how he had struggled at the
end of his first stint with the team in 1998 when he left with a 2-7
record, a 5.05 ERA and speculation his arm was shot. Nomo has won his
last six decisions, his last loss coming July 16 against the St.
Louis Cardinals.</TE>

<HD>Jordan Is the Flavor of the Month</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: He has come through with big hits in September,
just as he did with Cardinals and Braves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Brian Jordan is rolling again with a National League playoff berth at
stake, so it must be late September.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodger left fielder does his best work as the regular season
winds down and the pressure rises, providing daily reminders about
the importance of the month and moment with each clutch hit. The St.
Louis Cardinals and Atlanta Braves previously benefited from Jordan's
contributions down the stretch of postseason races, and the Dodgers
are hoping they don't waste his latest timely performance.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan has delivered as the Dodgers chase the San Francisco Giants
for the NL wild-card berth, but the cleanup batter can only do so
much with their rotation in tatters and time running out.</LD>
<TE>   "He's getting those big hits when we've really need them, and
that's the reason why we're still in this thing," right fielder Shawn
Green said. "Teams are pitching around me and choosing to challenge
him, and he's making them pay."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan is having his best month of the season, batting .304 with
five home runs, 24 runs batted in and a .594 slugging percentage in
19 games.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, he is batting .274 with 18 homers and 74 RBIs in 121
games.</TE>
<TE>   His statistics seemingly aren't that impressive, but they look
better considering Jordan has played the entire season on a damaged
left knee, was on the disabled list in August because of a strained
lower back and was sidelined in May with a strained abdominal muscle.</TE>
<TE>   And Jordan thought playing for the NFL's Atlanta Falcons was
tough.</TE>
<TE>   "How am I? Well, I'm holding up and doing what I have to do to
stay on the field," said Jordan, who plans to undergo knee surgery
immediately after the season. "I'm salvaging my season and giving us
a shot, and that's why they brought me over here."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan delivered in the four-game showdown at Dodger Stadium with
the Giants pitching around No. 3 batter Green, hitting a grand slam
in Monday's 7-6 victory and getting three hits and three RBIs in
Thursday's 6-3 victory.</TE>
<TE>   A Giant victory Thursday would have given them a three-game lead
with nine games to play, but Jordan led the way.</TE>
<TE>   "When we needed hits the most, he came through with some big
ones," first baseman Eric Karros said. "In some clutch RBI
opportunities ... he's allowed us to breathe a little bit easier."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan helped the Braves hold off the New York Mets and clinch
their 10th consecutive division title last season, capping a
seven-run rally Sept. 29 with a two-out, ninth-inning grand slam in
an 8-5 victory. He batted .333 for the Cardinals in September of 1996
as they won the NL Central.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm used to those situations," Jordan said. "I hit behind Chipper
Jones for three years in Atlanta, Mark McGwire in St. Louis and now
I'm hitting behind Greenie.</TE>
<TE>   "Teams trying to make the playoffs are going to take a chance with
me instead of Chipper, or guys like McGwire or Greenie, because I'm
not a home run hitter. I accept that and just look at it like a
challenge."</TE>

<HD>Carson Is No Match for Taft</HD>

<LD>If this was a statement game, Woodland Hills Taft made it loud and
clear.</LD>
<LD>   The Toreadors dominated Carson from the outset, rolling up a
32-point, first-half lead on the way to a surprisingly easy 39-0
victory in a nonleague game between two City Section powers Friday
night at Taft.</LD>
<LD>   Quarterback Cary Dove threw for four touchdowns, three to wide
receiver Paul Pratt. But this was a night when the Toreador defense
was in the spotlight.</LD>
<TE>   The unit forced three turnovers, registered four sacks and knocked
Carson quarterback Beau Davis out of the game with a separated left
shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're going to win any championship this year, it's going to
be with our defense," Taft Coach Troy Starr said. "Defense wins
championships. They played really well."</TE>
<TE>   Taft (2-0), ranked No. 8 by The Times, used its offense to apply
pressure early in the game. Using a halfback-option pass in the
shadow of its end zone, Ian Bell completed a 46-yard strike to Noah
Smith on the first play to move the ball to midfield.</TE>
<TE>   Bell kept the opening drive alive with a 29-yard run down to the
Carson 12. Two plays later, Dove hit Steve Smith on a slant pattern
for a three-yard touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Taft made it 14-0 when Dove found Pratt in the back of the end
zone for a 19-yard scoring play. Dove finished with 188 yards
passing, but the Toreadors didn't need to put up huge offensive
numbers as a shellshocked Carson team began to fall apart.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin McCall fumbled a handoff and linebacker Lance Broadus picked
it up in stride to make it 19-0. McCall fumbled on the next
possession and Taft scored moments later on Bell's nine-yard run.</TE>
<TE>   The Toreadors added the finishing blow when Dove threw his third
scoring pass, a 10-yarder to Pratt over the middle. No. 13 Carson
(1-1) made a last-gasp drive to midfield, but Davis was sacked by
Justin Thaemert to end a disastrous first half.</TE>
<TE>   "They had a great performance," Carson Coach John Aguirre said.
"But it's Week 2. You can't bag the whole season in Week 2. We sort
of fumbled and stumbled tonight."</TE>
<TE>   The Colts finished with 238 total yards, but only 63 came on the
ground.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to brag about a September win," Starr said. "We're
not going to get too high over this."</TE>
<TE>   Eric Stephens</TE>
<TE>   Lake Balboa Birmingham 38, San Pedro 14--Chad Green had six
receptions for 189 yards and caught touchdown passes of 80, 55 and 18
yards in the first half for the visiting Patriots, who led, 31-0,
after three quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Lombardo completed 11 of 14 passes for 334 yards and kicked a
23-yard field goal for Birmingham (1-1), which was coming off a
last-minute, 24-20 loss to Sherman Oaks Notre Dame. Dennis Keyes
rushed for 192 yards in 15 carries, including a 66-yard touchdown run
late in the third quarter that ended a six-play, 99-yard drive.</TE>
<TE>   Dustin Garneau completed eight of 21 passes for 115 yards and two
touchdowns. Starter Steven Taylor completed nine of 16 passes for 104
yards for San Pedro (1-1), which was trying to avenge a 33-21
first-round playoff loss last season.</TE>
<TE>   John Whitt caught seven passes for 137 yards for the Pirates,
including a 44-yard touchdown reception with 25 seconds to play.
Ranier Howard led San Pedro with 97 yards in 20 carries and Deon Bell
added 86 yards in 13 carries.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Galluzzo</TE>
<TE>   Wilmington Banning 28, North Hollywood 6--Patrick Perry rushed for
182 yards in 12 carries, including scoring runs of 57 and 51 yards,
and A.J. Tuitele added 132 yards in 18 carries with two touchdowns to
lead the Pilots at Banning.</TE>
<TE>   The Huskies (1-1), coming off a victory over Granada Hills, scored
on their opening drive by going 92 yards in 20 plays, capped by
German Perez's one-yard scoring run. But North Hollywood committed
three turnovers that resulted in 14 points for Banning (2-0). Perez
finished with 52 yards in 12 carries and Justin Tyler added 60 yards
in 15 rushes for the Huskies.</TE>

<HD>Hart Stops St. Bonaventure Streak</HD>
<DH>Football: Indians romp to 31-6 victory as sophomore Wolfe
contains Seraph standout Lewis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SONDHEIMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Let the record show that 15-year-old sophomore cornerback, Ryan Wolfe
of Newhall Hart, went toe to toe with speedy receiver Whitney Lewis
of Ventura St. Bonaventure and came away Friday night feeling as if
he were ready to conquer the world.</LD>
<LD>   "Wolfe is for real," Hart defensive coordinator Rick Herrington
shouted after the Indians' secondary held Lewis to two receptions for
35 yards in a 31-6 rout Friday night at College of the Canyons before
a sellout crowd of 9,000. "These are the games you get scholarships
for--shutting down the No. 1 receiver in the state."</LD>
<LD>   St. Bonaventure's 43-game winning streak came to a screeching halt
because the Seraphs showed they are no better than a one-man team.
They tried to create opportunities for Lewis at running back, where
he gained 119 yards in 13 carries and scored his team's only
touchdown on a 58-yard run.</LD>
<TE>   But Hart (1-0-1), ranked No. 6 by The Times, had weapons galore.
Quarterback Sean Norton completed 15 of 31 passes for 356 yards and
three touchdowns. Receiver Kevin Ciccone caught seven passes for 158
yards and two touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   The Indians' defense intercepted three passes and forced junior
quarterback Brian Stevens into numerous mistakes. He completed 10 of
26 passes for 80 yards for the No. 11 Seraphs.</TE>
<TE>   And then there was Wolfe, who made his first varsity start last
week in a 21-21 tie with No. 5 Los Alamitos. Told by Herrington that
he'd cover Lewis anywhere on the field, he said "OK." But few high
school players are more dangerous than Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like a cat-and-mouse game trying to chase him around the
field," Wolfe said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Lewis: "I feel I did what I could. I felt they didn't stop
me."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the game's conclusion, Lewis got a cell call from
former Seraph star Lorenzo Booker, now at Florida State. It was a
quick call, because not much went right for St. Bonaventure, the
three-time Division XI champion which has moved in to the Division IV
Channel League. Hart, the four-time Division III champion which has
moved to Division II, is different.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels so good to step them down a notch when their offense has
been so cocky," Herrington said.</TE>
<TE>   St. Bonaventure (1-1) trailed, 21-6, at halftime. Lewis had a
nine-yard run on his team's first play, then didn't touch the ball
again until a 55-yard punt return with 11:09 left in the second
quarter.</TE>

<DH>Football: Mission Viejo's offense may get glory, but
defense that lost many of its 2001 starters is a force again as
unbeaten Diablos stop Mater Dei, 21-19.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Think Mission Viejo High football, and several images come to mind.</LD>
<LD>   There's the high-powered running game that produced headlines last
season, when the Diablos won the school's first Southern Section
title in 20 years.</LD>
<LD>   There's Coach Bob Johnson, the brusque quarterback guru who
instructs elite high school signal-callers every summer at his
renowned camp.</LD>
<TE>   Down the list is the Diablos' defense.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, not giving that unit special credit for the team's success is
like giving George Harrison only passing mention in a discussion of
the Beatles, or emphasizing only Orville Wright's contributions to
the airplane.</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo's defense was--and is--every bit as significant as
its offense, which regularly churns out 40 points a game, and its
coach, who prepares quarterbacks as well as anyone in the country.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because the headlines aren't talking about what they did,"
defensive coordinator Marty Mikkelsen said of his players, "they know
that there were games last year where if it weren't for their effort
and their success, we wouldn't have won."</TE>
<TE>   The Diablos shut out four opponents and limited teams to 8.9
points per game on their way to a 14-0 record last season. They held
Chino, which had averaged 38 points, to nine in an 18-9 victory in
the Division II title game.</TE>
<TE>   And in what might be its biggest test this season, the Mission
Viejo defense stiffened when it needed to Friday night during a 21-19
nonleague victory over Santa Ana Mater Dei before about 6,000 at
Santa Ana Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Senior lineman Justin Williams sacked Mater Dei's Jason Forcier on
a two-point conversion attempt that would have tied the score with 4
minutes 35 seconds to play, highlighting a stellar second-half
effort. Williams also recovered a fumble in the third quarter and
sacked Forcier twice on the Monarchs' final drive.</TE>
<TE>   "They were double-and triple-teaming [lineman] Chris Cole,"
Williams said. "They had single coverage on me, and the coaches told
me to just shoot in there."</TE>
<TE>   Senior lineman Ryan Quarles also played well for the Diablos
(2-0), No. 4 in The Times' rankings, recovering two fumbles. Senior
linebacker Chance Moline contributed early by intercepting a pass by
Jason Mier at the Mater Dei 43-yard line and returning it to the one.
Brandon Johnston, who finished with 123 yards rushing and two
touchdowns, bulled one yard into the end zone four plays later to
make the score 6-0.</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo held Mater Dei to 43 yards in the second half after
the No. 14 Monarchs (1-1) got 126 in taking a 13-9 halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   The defense was no less impressive in Mission Viejo's opener, a
48-0 rout of Fountain Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "That," senior nose tackle Cole said, "showed that our defense was
ready."</TE>
<TE>   It was ready to start the season despite losing two of its best
players, middle linebacker Ryan Powdrell (Saddleback College) and
cornerback Joe Fleskoski (Texas El Paso), and returning only two
starters in Cole and senior defensive back Marcus Dailey.</TE>
<TE>   Fleskoski's replacement, junior Marty Tadman, had two
interceptions against the Barons in his debut as a starter.</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo's coaches and players contend that this year's
defense might be better than the one that established itself as the
stingiest in Orange County last season. The starting linemen average
6 feet 1 and 240 pounds, and the slowest averages a respectable 5.0
seconds in the 40-yard dash.</TE>
<TE>   "We've kept the speed with a bigger front," Johnson said. "We
think we can defend some things better than last year because of
that."</TE>
<TE>   If nothing else, Mission Viejo's defense is more experienced.</TE>
<TE>   A liberal substitution policy had reserves Jed Collins, Travis
Wittick and Aaron Miller spelling the Diablo starters last season.
They not only played, but made key plays. Wittick, for example,
dropped the Chino fullback for a four-yard loss on a drive inside the
Mission Viejo 15-yard line that resulted in no points.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we have guys who have gone through the wars," said Steve
Sherman, who coaches the inside linebackers.</TE>
<TE>   Talent and experience are only part of the story. Sherman and
Mikkelsen emphasize hustle and squeeze out every drop of effort. The
co-architects of the defense hold court with their charges in the
back of a cramped trailer with the air conditioning cranked to what
feels like 40 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Plastered on the walls are motivational posters created by Sherman
and Mikkelsen from what they've gleaned from annual spring visits to
college football powerhouses throughout the country. At Oklahoma last
spring, the coaches got the idea for a poster listing 12 traits that
characterize great defensive line play, such as never attempting to
go around or give ground to pressure.</TE>
<TE>   The adage they expound most is from another college power,
Tennessee: "A man's value to his team can be measured by his distance
from the ball when the whistle blows."</TE>
<TE>   Dailey, a three-year starter, said that has become the defense's
mantra. "You have to play hard to play your best," he said. "You
can't be lazy."</TE>
<TE>   For Sherman and Mikkelsen, it's as simple as this: Those who don't
hustle don't play. Each player receives a pursuit grade every week,
and those who fail to perform satisfactorily at least 90% of the time
sit out until the message sinks in.</TE>
<TE>   "They've done an outstanding job of molding a defense that pursues
and gets after people," Johnson said of his assistants.</TE>
<TE>   If the wiry and fiery Mikkelsen seems like an odd choice as a
defensive coordinator, it's because he is. Once a quarterback at
Garden Grove Pacifica High, Saddleback College and Baylor, he coached
Mission Viejo's tight ends until three years ago, when defensive
coordinator Tony Uruburu left to become head coach at Rolling Hills
Estates Peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson tabbed Mikkelsen as his new coordinator despite his lack
of experience.</TE>
<TE>   "It was one of those things where you say, 'That might be fun,' "
Mikkelsen said of the change. "And when you get the job it's like,
'Oh no, now what?' "</TE>
<TE>   A cadre of experts, including defensive line coach Marty Spalding,
outside linebacker coach Bob Bosanko and defensive ends coach George
Tuioti, has helped tutor Mikkelsen, but it's his work with Sherman
that stands out.</TE>
<TE>   "Together we have a really good mix," Sherman said. "He knows
what's really nasty for a quarterback and an offense to face. I can
get us there."</TE>
<TE>   The coaches prepare their players by making them meticulously
break down an opponent's strengths and weaknesses.</TE>
<TE>   "They work us all day," Dailey said. "Film, notes, study this,
study that.... By Friday, we just have to go out there and execute."</TE>

<HD>Sunderland Receives 1-Year Laker Offer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lakers have decided who they want to be Chick Hearn's successor,
at least for one season.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Sunderland has been offered a one-year contract to become
their new play-by-play announcer, The Times learned Friday.</LD>
<LD>   That Sunderland was offered the job is no surprise.</LD>
<TE>   What is surprising, however, is the length of the contract, which
could be a sticking point.</TE>
<TE>   Sunderland's work was generally well received when he filled in
last season for Hearn, the legendary announcer who missed 56 games,
first because of heart and then knee surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn, the only play-by-play announcer the Lakers had had after
moving to Los Angeles from Minneapolis in 1960, died Aug. 5 of
injuries suffered in a fall at his home in Encino.</TE>
<TE>   Sunderland all along was considered the front-runner to replace
Hearn.</TE>
<TE>   Sunderland had gone fishing Friday--it was a long-planned
trip--and was not available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   According to sources, the offer was presented Friday to
Sunderland's agent, Martin Mandel of San Francisco. Mandel declined
comment, as did Jeanie Buss, the Lakers' executive vice president of
business operations.</TE>
<TE>   Laker commentator Stu Lantz said he would prefer to hold comment
until the deal was completed.</TE>
<TE>   Sunderland, Mandel and Jeanie Buss are expected to meet Monday.
Jeanie Buss is handling negotiations for the Lakers, although her
father, owner Jerry Buss, has the final say.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn and Lantz, who is starting his 16th season with the Lakers,
usually were given contracts of two or three years' duration. They
both preferred short-term contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said Sunderland would prefer a longer-term contract, at
least longer than one year.</TE>
<TE>   Something needs to be worked out fairly soon. The Lakers will play
their first exhibition game Oct. 8, against the Clippers at
Bakersfield. That game will be televised by Channel 9 and broadcast
on flagship radio station KLAC (570).</TE>
<TE>   Laker spokesman John Black, although declining to comment on the
Sunderland situation, did confirm that the Lakers would stick with
simulcasts for at least one more year.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are one of the few teams in the NBA that simulcast.</TE>

<LD>Hey, guys, give up on Kevin Brown. He was over the hill the day he
graciously condescended to accept his $105-million contract, private
jet travel, etc., and bring his shot arm to Chavez Ravine. Bite the
checkbook, pay the guy off, send him on his way, and let's all forget
he existed--which, when it came to mound time, he barely did.</LD>

<TE>   I suggest that Kevin Brown's "travel home" clause be amended to a
one-way trip on the midnight train to Georgia. What a waste.</TE>

<TE>   Dear Dodgers,</TE>
<TE>   As part of its fall program, our local community theater is
putting on a production of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." The
casting of the hard-working little fellas is coming together quite
nicely. We've already got Happy, Sneezy, Dopey and Bashful taken care
of. And we're pretty sure who's going to play Doc and Sleepy. But we
were wondering, now that your $105-million free-agent franchise
pitcher is out for the year (again) ... do you think Kevin Brown
would be available in early to mid-October to play Grumpy?</TE>
<TE>   Jim Mallon</TE>
<TE>   San Luis Obispo</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Passion, intensity and desire are certainly qualities you want in
a ballplayer. Then there are players with so much passion, intensity
and desire that they're counterproductive. Kevin Brown falls into
this latter category and again, it's the Dodgers who suffer far more
than Brown himself.</TE>
<TE>   By continually convincing his doctors and Dodger management that
he has recovered from his injuries and returned to action way too
soon for his own good, Brown more often than not ends up injured for
a far greater period of time in the long run. This has hurt the
Dodgers time after time.</TE>
<TE>   Had Brown followed a schedule prescribed for mere mortals, he'd
have rested the last month and would be ready to return right about
now, just in time for the final pennant run. But no, his
out-of-control passions, intensity and desire killed off any chance
for that. Thank you, Kevin Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, his doctors and Dodger management must take their share
of the blame for not standing up to him and telling him to take a
seat on the pine, that he's not playing until the average recovery
time has elapsed.</TE>

<LD>I was amazed to see an article by Shav Glick on CART ["Andretti to
Put IRL before CART," Sept. 18]. It's not the week of the Long Beach
Grand Prix or Fontana, so it must be an opportunity for him to act in
his other capacity, de facto spokesman for Tony George and the IRL.</LD>
<LD>   The IRL was supposed to be a breeding ground for American drivers,
yet of the three drivers announced switching over to the IRL, two are
foreigners, as were both of Roger Penske's drivers who switched last
year. Let's be real, Shav, the only reason the IRL exists is because
of the Indy 500. Without it, the IRL doesn't survive. That's the only
reason Andretti's team is switching, because his sponsors want the
exposure at Indy, not because it is a superior series.</LD>

<LD>The Times, in an attempt to inject some drama into a fait accompli,
trumpets the race between the Angels and the A's as "AL West
Showdown."</LD>
<LD>   What showdown? A quick look at the standings reveals that both
teams (barring a miracle) are guaranteed playoff berths under the
wild-card system. (A contrivance inflicted upon the sport by
self-described "traditionalist" Bud Selig.)</LD>
<LD>   Instead of the excitement and spectacle of two teams battling down
to the wire with something actually at stake, we get two teams
playing out the string, each knowing that they have playoff berths
locked up whether they finish first or not.</LD>
<TE>   That's a showdown? Not in my book. Yet, all the chin-strokers
still can't figure out why baseball is losing fans to football,
basketball and soccer.</TE>

Scioscia, Bud Black, Mickey Hatcher et al. and the players are the
real reason for the Angels' inspired play. The rally monkey has more
to do with the Angels winning than Disney or Eisner.</TE>

<TE>   After Donovan McNabb's good performance against the hapless
Redskins, I heard several commentators proclaim him the NFL's best
quarterback. The facts say otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   In the last three years, Kurt Warner has thrown for about 13,000
yards, 98 touchdowns, has a QB rating of over 100 and has been to two
Super Bowls. In the same time McNabb has about 8,000 yards and about
50 TDs and a QB rating of less than 90. And he has never been to a
Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   One of the main measuring sticks for quarterbacks is getting his

<LD>How could Bill Dwyre's recap of the Notre Dame-Michigan game totally
ignore the Irish's "phantom" touchdown, in which quarterback Carlyle
Holiday crossed the Wolverine goal line while the ball was behind him
on the three-yard line? Didn't he see even one of the countless
replays? In what year did Dwyre (and/or his editor) graduate a
"Domer"?</LD>

<TE>   As a Michigan grad with UCLA connections, I seldom have anything
nice to say about the Trojans. However, I have followed Justin
Fargas' career since he went to Ann Arbor after John Robinson was
unjustly fired. The dedication and citizenship that Fargas displayed
coming back from his injury is the kind of character for which
Michigan is noted. If he and Drew Henson had stayed, last year the
Wolverines might have played for the national championship.</TE>
<TE>   When Bo Schembechler said that this year's Michigan team just
isn't tough enough, I imagine he was wishing that Fargas was still
there. I hope he has a terrific year, even if it means the Trojans
win more than five or six games.</TE>

<LD>Am I wrong, or has Times golf writer Thomas Bonk ever written a
column that didn't include Tiger Woods' name?</LD>
<LD>   Apparently, Tiger is news whether he wins, loses, almost wins,
almost loses, doesn't play, almost doesn't play, evaluates equipment,
changes coaches, considers endorsements, comments on courses, winks
in approval, nods in agreement, frowns in disappointment. Astronomers
study distant galaxies less diligently than Mr. Bonk appears to study
Mr. Woods.</LD>

<TE>   "A First: Woman Qualifies for PGA Event" [Sept. 18]. Like many, I
read the article thinking I was going to read about a woman golfer
(Suzy Whaley) who competed with men, played the same course, and
legitimately achieved equality. Then, I came to the qualifying
statement indicating that she had played her three qualifying rounds
from the "women's tees."</TE>
<TE>   The Greater Hartford Open chairman said Whaley would have to play
the Hartford event from the same tees as the men. I can already
imagine the rebuttal we are going to hear from the likes of female
activist-attorney Gloria Allred, and the strident representation from
the National Organization of Women.</TE>

<HD>Mets: Drug Use Not Rampant</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>New York Met General Manager Steve Phillips denied there is
widespread drug use on the team after a report that at least seven
players smoked marijuana this season.</LD>
<LD>   "In my opinion, there is not rampant drug use on our major league
roster," Phillips said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Tony Tarasco, Mark Corey and reliever Grant Roberts were
identified by Newsday as among those who had used marijuana. The
paper, which did not name any other Mets, cited unidentified sources
close to the team.</LD>
<TE>   "I guarantee you no one was in uniform and smoking marijuana,
unless they were running around with a whole lot of Visine in their
eyes," Met Manager Bobby Valentine said. "I grew up in the '60s. I
think I could tell by looking in a guys' eyes if he was smoking
dope."</TE>
<TE>   Valentine said he couldn't understand why a player would use
marijuana before a game.</TE>
<TE>   "Marijuana is not a performance enhancer. I don't think anybody
would want to get in there and try to dodge a 95-mph fastball," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe I'm naive. Maybe afterward. I don't know. I don't party
with the guys."</TE>

<HD>This Division Subtracts Mariners</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Who knows about those 116 wins of last year? Did they prove to be an
albatross to the Mariners in 2002 or were they forgotten, dismissed
as something of a historic aberration as Manager Lou Piniella had
urged in spring training, cautioning his team that it was a new year?</LD>
<LD>   The Mariners will have time to ponder those questions over a long
winter, but it is safe to say that 116 now clouds perspective,
complicating any attempt to measure what kind of season the Mariners
have had. A year ago they had already popped champagne in celebration
of a division title. Now, their wild-card hopes requiring a miracle
as tall as the Space Needle, they are spoilers as the Angels and
Oakland A's battle for the title, and if it isn't a bad season when
you don't win, what is it, what other measure is there?</LD>
<LD>   Well, there's the fact that the American League West is one tough
division, and yet the Mariners are probably going to join the A's and
Angels as the third team to win 90 or more games, and while 90 is a
long way from 116, there was Piniella to provide some of the elusive
perspective as he sat at his desk and said, of the A's and Angels,
that the Mariners "were simply caught and passed by a pair of runaway
roller coasters."</LD>
<TE>   "For three teams from the same division to win 90 games is
unbelievable," he said. "If you look at history, if you win 91 or 92
games, that generally gets you to the postseason, but not this
season."</TE>
<TE>   Piniella shook his head, then said: "I knew coming out of spring
training it would be very competitive. I saw Oakland and knew they
were good. I saw the Angels and knew they were good. I knew it would
be a dogfight. Now, what I didn't know was that Oakland would run off
20 straight wins in August and that the Angels would win 15 of 16,
and that's what happened. That, plus the fact that we played about
.500 ball for three months, and that wasn't going to be good enough
to hold off two teams playing as well as the A's and Angels."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, coming off their 8-1 victory in Friday night's series
opener, can officially clinch a playoff berth today by eliminating
the Mariners from wild-card contention. Maybe the frustration of
those three months on the .500 treadmill played into Piniella's
Wednesday night eruption when the 59-year-old manager rewound his
personal highlight reel during a volatile argument with umpire C. B.
Bucknor, kicking at his cap several times before dislodging the first
base bag and heaving it up the line.</TE>
<TE>   Piniella laughed in reflection and said he doesn't expect to go
out for the "Senior Olympics soon," but of those three months when
the A's and Angels were picking up steam, the laugh faded and he
said, "We've created expectations here, a lot of them, and because of
it you sense that feeling of frustration. In retrospect, we needed
things here all summer, and that came to light [as the Mariners were
losing a division lead that was 6 1/2 games on May 11 and that they
last shared on Aug. 22]."</TE>
<TE>   That need, Piniella said, was one more pitcher and definitely one
more run-producing hitter, and while Piniella kept expressing those
needs to management--"I'm not doing my job if I don't say what our
needs are when I'm asked"--and while General Manager Pat Gillick kept
trying to fill them, he was handicapped, Piniella said, by injuries
in the farm system that limited who he could trade and by ownership's
reluctance to increase an $80-million payroll despite projected
attendance of 3.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   So, while the Angels added Alex Ochoa and the A's added Ray Durham
and Ricardo Rincon, the best Gillick could do was Jose Offerman and
Ismael Valdes, not exactly what the manager had in mind, and the
result has been speculation that an exasperated Piniella would ask
out of the final year of his contract to possibly manage the Devil
Rays in his Tampa Bay backyard--speculation he flatly denied Friday
night, saying he would return to Seattle next year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm an organization man," Piniella said. "My job is to manage the
pieces I'm given."</TE>
<TE>   Well, one valuable piece was lost early when Edgar Martinez
ruptured a knee tendon in April and sat out three months and that was
just one complication. Jeff Cirillo failed to bring the Coors Field
altitude with him and was a major disappointment at third base, and
Mike Cameron, Bret Boone and Ichiro Suzuki have failed to duplicate
their 2001 production.</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say they won't emerge with some very good
statistics, but instead of 116 wins, the Mariners lead the league in
runners left on base, which undermined a rotation that lost 17-game
winner Paul Abbott to a season-long injury and 15-game winner Aaron
Sele to the Angels as a free agent and has lacked reliability behind
Freddy Garcia, Jamie Moyer and rookie Joel Pineiro, who was racked by
the Angels on Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   And complicating all of that, one of Piniella's 25 pieces was a
Rule 5 draftee (Luis Ugueto) who was basically limited to
pinch-running and another was an outfielder (Charles Gipson)
basically limited to defense. "And when you have an older team that
doesn't have the depth it should," the manager said, "you're forced
to overextend players who shouldn't be overextended." He was
referring to 36-year-old Ruben Sierra.</TE>
<TE>   So, on another night when the Angels looked more like the Mariners
of last year than the Mariners did, a night when his team "might have
played it's worst game of the year" and failed to fulfill his
pre-game hope "to make it interesting and competitive for the Angels
and A's over the final nine games" when they play only the Angels and
A's, Piniella would also reflect on all of the factors that have
impacted 2002 and said, "you know, we've had a very respectable
season but just fell a little short. I'm disappointed, but my
disappointment is for the fans. They expected more."</TE>
<TE>   There are now eight games to play, and no one knows what to expect
from the Mariners after that because Gillick might choose not to
return and there is a lot of age on a roster that includes nine free
agents (John Olerud, Dan Wilson and Moyer among them), and there is
the issue of how much ownership is willing to spend, which means
Martinez and his $10-million option could also be gone.</TE>
<TE>   If that, too, has impacted performance in the season after 116
wins, one Mariner wasn't buying any excuse. "I tip my cap to the
Angels and A's because they've played unbelievably," said Boone, "but
we had control of [the race] and let it slip away by playing under
what we're capable of.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no one to blame but ourselves."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For someone who thinks a World Golf Championship is more meaningful
than the Ryder Cup, Tiger Woods is sure making this look like an
exhibition.</LD>
<LD>   Woods took another step toward the $1-million payoff Friday with
his second consecutive seven-under-par 65, giving him a two-stroke
lead over Jerry Kelly heading into the weekend at the American
Express Championship at Thomastown, Ireland.</LD>
<LD>   Mount Juliet was a pushover again in cool, relatively calm
conditions. Or maybe Woods is simply making it look that way.</LD>
<TE>   He hasn't made a bogey in 36 holes, finished his two rounds at
14-under 130 and then gave the elite, 64-player field something else
to consider.</TE>
<TE>   "Can I play better? Yes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   British Open champion Ernie Els had a 67 to finish at 135 and said
he was in contention, although "It all depends on what Tiger does."</TE>
<TE>   Woods has won his last 14 events on the PGA Tour when leading
after 36 holes, dating to the 1999 Byron Nelson Classic.</TE>
<TE>   David Toms recovered from back-to-back bogeys with five birdies on
the back nine to salvage a 67 and finish at 11-under 133, along with
Steve Lowery.</TE>
<TE>   Retief Goosen had his second consecutive 67 and was at 134. Even
David Duval got in on the action, making eight birdies in a round of
65 that put him at eight-under 136.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Meg Mallon and Michele Redman made consecutive birdies en route to
a surprising 3 and 1 best-ball match victory over Maria Hjorth and
Annika Sorenstam in the opening day of the Solheim Cup at Edina,
Minn., helping the Americans to a 4-4 tie after they fell behind,
3-1, following the morning alternate-shot matches.</TE>
<TE>   Rosie Jones and Cristie Kerr thwarted an remarkable comeback led
by Laura Davies to earn another key point in an afternoon match for
the Americans. Davies and Paula Marti rallied from a 4-down deficit
before Jones and Kerr won their best-ball match, 1-up. Jones made a
three-foot birdie putt on No. 18 to halve the hole after Davies made
birdie, although she had hit her tee shot in the water on the
par-five.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   K.J. Choi shot a three-under 68 to maintain a two-stroke lead in
the Tampa Bay Classic at Palm Harbor, Fla. Choi was at 11-under

grab a two-shot lead over Dana Quigley in the first round of the SAS
Championship at Cary, N.C.</TE>

<TE>   Serena Williams routed Australia's Nicole Pratt, 6-1, 6-0, winning
in 39 minutes to reach the semifinals of the Toyota Princess Cup at
Tokyo. Williams next faces Amy Frazier, a 2-6, 6-1, 6-4 winner over
sixth-seeded Tatiana Panova.</TE>
<TE>   Jelena Dokic, seeded second and the defending champion, cruised to
a 6-3, 6-1, victory over seventh-seeded Tamarine Tanasugarn. Her
semifinal opponent will be third-seeded Kim Clijsters, who beat Elena
Likhovtseva, 6-2, 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Toe Nash, a high school dropout the Tampa Bay Devil Rays once
compared to Babe Ruth, was released from jail in New Orleans after
pleading guilty to having sex with a 15-year-old girl.</TE>
<TE>   Nash, 20, was facing life in prison on three counts of aggravated
rape, according to Arthur Lemann IV, Nash's lawyer. Last season, Nash
played for the Princeton Devil Rays of the Appalachian League in West
Virginia, batting .240 in 47 games.</TE>

<HD>Cardinals Pay Tribute After Winning Title</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before the celebration began, the St. Louis Cardinals paused to honor
a teammate and broadcaster.</LD>
<LD>   Manager Tony La Russa gathered the team after their National
League Central-clinching 9-3 victory over the Houston Astros on
Friday night at St. Louis to remind the Cardinals of the hurdles
they've cleared and to pay tribute to Darryl Kile and Jack Buck.</LD>
<LD>   This is the Cardinals' third consecutive playoff berth and third
division title in seven years under La Russa, and it clearly came
under some of the toughest of circumstances.</LD>
<TE>   Kile died in the team's Chicago hotel on June 22 from a blockage
of the arteries supplying the heart. It came only four days after the
death of longtime announcer Buck, leaving a huge hole in the rotation
and a team in depression.</TE>
<TE>   Third baseman Scott Rolen, one of St. Louis' key in-season
additions, ended the game with a leaping catch to rob Brian Hunter of
a hit. The Cardinals celebrated near the mound at Busch Stadium as
Albert Pujols carried Kile's jersey onto the field.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Edmonds sprayed Kile's jersey with champagne in the clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals lost another pitcher in the clincher. Woody
Williams, making his fifth start since coming off his second stint on
the disabled list for a pulled muscle in his left side, left the game
in the fifth with tightness in his back and rib cage.</TE>
<TE>   Eli Marrero had four hits, including one of the Cardinals' four
homers, and four runs scored to highlight a 14-hit attack.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco 5, Milwaukee 1--Ryan Jensen gave up one run and four
hits in 5 1/3 innings and Rich Aurilia hit a two-run home run for the
Giants at Milwaukee. The Giants have a two-game lead over the Dodgers
in the NL wild-card race. Milwaukee (54-99) set a franchise record
for losses. The previous mark of 98 was set in 1969, when the team
was the Seattle Pilots.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 9, Arizona 4--Todd Helton hit a tiebreaking home run in
the fifth inning at Denver and the Rockies pounded Curt Schilling for
his worst outing of the year. Schilling (23-6) gave up a season-worst
nine runs--eight earned--and 14 hits in 7 1/3 innings. Colorado's
Mike Hampton will not pitch the rest of the season because of a
strained ligament in his right foot.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 5, Chicago 4--Sammy Sosa hit his 498th career homer but
the Pirates rallied for two runs in the ninth to win at Pittsburgh.
Antonio Alfonseca (2-5), who has converted only 19 of 27 save
chances, gave up an RBI double to Armando Rios and an RBI single to
Jack Wilson to end the game.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 6, New York 1--Vladimir Guerrero stole three bases and
Tony Armas Jr. pitched into the eighth inning as the Expos won at New
York for their seventh consecutive victory. Armas improved to 3-0 in
his last four starts. Guerrero has 39 stolen bases and 37 home runs.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 6, Atlanta 2--Abraham Nunez got his first two major league
hits and fellow rookie Justin Wayne got his second victory as the
Marlins won at Atlanta. Florida's Kevin Millar went 0 for 3 with two
walks, ending his 25-game hitting streak.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia at Cincinnati, ppd.--The game will be made up today
as part of a doubleheader.</TE>

<HD>Running a Reverse</HD>
<DH>Willingham at Notre Dame and Tedford at Cal have turned
their schools' fortunes around by combining some of the old with the
new</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Can coaching really make this much difference?</LD>
<LD>   California has gone from Tom Holmoe to Jeff Tedford--and from 1-10
to 3-0 and a No. 23 ranking after an upset of Michigan State.</LD>
<LD>   Notre Dame went from Bob Davie to Tyrone Willingham--and from 5-6
to 3-0 with a No. 12 ranking and "Return to Glory" T-shirts all the
rage.</LD>
<TE>   Can Xs and O's change everything so completely?</TE>
<TE>   The players say yes, but insist there's more to it than that.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think just anyone was going to come in here and win,"
Notre Dame kicker Nick Setta said. "With everything that's happened,
our spirits were down. When Coach Willingham came in, he brought
great expectations. I think it's the attitude around him. He really
makes you believe you're going to win."</TE>
<TE>   Cal quarterback Kyle Boller said he used to feel like pulling a
hood over his face when he walked around Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   "That was more of an analogy," he said. "But I wouldn't like to
show my face around campus, being the quarterback of a 1-10 team.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach Tedford came in here and let the guys know Cal football was
going to change.... Guys around here were ready to win. He came from
a winning program and knows what it takes to win, and guys really
bought in."</TE>
<TE>   The era of good feeling never lasts long unless you score more
points than the other team, though.</TE>
<TE>   There probably isn't a better example in the country of what one
coach can do for one player than what Tedford has done for Boller.</TE>
<TE>   Until Tedford arrived, the once-promising quarterback from Newhall
Hart High was a borderline bust, with a career completion percentage
of 45% and more interceptions than touchdown passes.</TE>
<TE>   Three seasons of battering and desperate passes had made a mess of
Boller's mechanics and his confidence.</TE>
<TE>   Tedford--a former offensive coordinator at Oregon and Fresno State
who worked with Joey Harrington, Akili Smith, David Carr and Trent
Dilfer--fixed the problems with some tape and a checkerboard.</TE>
<TE>   Now Boller leads the second-highest scoring offense in the nation,
averaging 50 points a game and trailing only Kansas State (59.7)</TE>
<TE>   "He made this contraption where he taped my biceps to my forearm
or wrist, to make my forearm more like a 90-degree angle, because I
tend to extend my arm too much," said Boller, who has thrown seven
touchdown passes to one interception so far.</TE>
<TE>   "One other thing he worked on was my mechanics with my feet. I
tended to hop around in the pocket." (The result, no doubt, of
running for his life.)</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the mental side. That's where the checkers come in.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, it's a way of understanding offenses," Boller said.
"He gives me a formation, and I set up the offense. Then I turn
around and he sets up the defense. I turn back around and look at
what's there. Then he'll say, 'OK, these two guys are coming, what do
you do?' And I'll say, 'I throw hot to the tight end.' "</TE>
<TE>   Besides all the quarterback wizardry, another big reason for Cal's
turnaround is a transformation on defense. The Bears gave up a
school-record 431 points last season--39.2 a game.</TE>
<TE>   New defensive coordinator Bob Gregory changed the defensive scheme
and the philosophy, playing a lot less man-to-man coverage in favor
of zones, so one mistake isn't as likely to turn into a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   But the most dramatic change is in turnover margin. With six
interceptions and six fumble recoveries already, Cal is second in the
nation in turnover margin after having been second worst in the
nation last season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something we concentrate on in practice," defensive tackle
Daniel Nwangwu said. "Just things like, when you make a tackle, try
to strip the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "[Tedford] always rewards us. He'll say, 'OK, if the defense can
get a certain number of turnovers, the defense doesn't have to run
today.' And he'll do the same for the offense, no conditioning if
they don't have turnovers. It's fun, but at the same time, it
prepares you to play that way in games."</TE>
<TE>   At Notre Dame, one of Willingham's most savvy decisions was not to
overhaul the defense. After all, it was the only thing about Notre
Dame that resembled a top-25 team last season.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish ranked 10th in the nation in pass defense, 14th in total
defense and 22nd in scoring defense--Notre Dame's best numbers since
'96, Davie's final season as defensive coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   "We did have a system that we liked, but also some great things
were being done here at Notre Dame," Willingham said. "Therefore, you
try to incorporate those things that blend with your system."</TE>
<TE>   It takes wisdom to resist change for change's sake.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, it can be a positive or a negative," said safety Glenn
Earl, one of the stalwarts of a defense led by big-play cornerbacks
Vontez Duff and Shane Walton. "With a different system, you have to
adjust to certain things.</TE>
<TE>   "We basically kept our defense intact. There are some different
techniques, maybe some different terminology, but all minor things."</TE>
<TE>   What Willingham did overhaul was the option-style offense,
bringing the West Coast offense with him from Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to say it's been a great success yet--the Irish didn't
score an offensive touchdown until their third game. But Willingham
and the players believe this is the better path.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew this was going to give me and all the players more
opportunities," quarterback Carlyle Holiday said. "In the past, the
fullbacks only blocked, the tight ends didn't catch many balls. Now
you never know who's going to get the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "Those things allow them to be more alert, more focused and much
better players."</TE>
<TE>   Listen carefully, and the things the players talk about again and
again are less about schemes and more about approach.</TE>
<TE>   Willingham is known for keeping his watch calibrated to the second
and for fast-paced practices that don't dwell on endless repetitions
of the same play.</TE>
<TE>   "It just goes by so fast," Holiday said. "It's like game
situations--you're not going to get a second chance.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be, around here in practice we'd go over the same play
over and over. You're more focused and sharp this way."</TE>
<TE>   Setta, the kicker, has the time and perspective to take it all in.</TE>
<TE>   "You see a lot of positive things," he said. "They're out there
letting players play. You don't see as many people tight or afraid of
making mistakes. They keep giving you reps. They're not going to sit
you down."</TE>
<TE>   These are players who by the end of last season felt as if the
whole country was piling on, and they were at the bottom of the
stack.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Notre Dame can aspire to a BCS game again.</TE>
<TE>   Cal--banned from playing in a bowl game this season as part of a
five-year NCAA probation for academic improprieties and improper
payment of hotel incidental expenses--will await results of an
appeal, expected in November. Recent precedent doesn't offer much
hope.</TE>
<TE>   But hope is what both these teams have now--and they couldn't have
found it with a telescope last year.</TE>
<TE>   "They had been through a rough season, going 1-10, so their
confidence was shot, their self-esteem was shot," Tedford said. "What
we tried to do was create an atmosphere where they could be positive,
and we were always going to be positive with them and let them know
we believed in them."</TE>
<TE>   Nwangwu got Tedford's message, loud and clear.</TE>
<TE>   "He just has this attitude of confidence he exudes. Something
struck me about that," Nwangwu said.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame is a universe away in terms of football tradition, but
the Irish players understand the feeling.</TE>
<TE>   "Really, the players seem to respond much better to this coaching
staff," Holiday said. "We seem to be more together than ever before.
We have the right attitude. I think that's just what happens."</TE>

<KH>UCLA vs. COLORADO at Rose Bowl</KH>
<HD>Bruins Expect Surprise Package</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UCLA is uneasy about this supposed walkover against struggling
Colorado today, believing Buffaloes' Coach Gary Barnett will try to
pull a "Booty Jenkins."</LD>
<LD>   The term is synonymous with chicanery in the lexicon of Bruin
assistant Don Johnson, who while growing up in New Jersey knew a
conniver who went by that name.</LD>
<LD>   "It means somebody is about to pull a fast one," Johnson said.</LD>
<TE>   Barnett has little choice but to resort to gimmicks, tricks and
sleight of hand. Business as usual is out of the question.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado (1-2) had virtually no offense in an embarrassing 40-3
loss to USC last week, accumulating only four first downs, 24 yards
passing and 37 yards rushing in 35 carries.</TE>
<TE>   The running attack was strong in the first two games, a loss to
Colorado State and a victory over San Diego State. But anybody who
believes the Buffaloes plan to simply run into the teeth of a stacked
UCLA front today is going to be, well, buffaloed.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything we did was wrong," Barnett said of the USC game. "It
just felt like we had no control.</TE>
<TE>   "We were totally inept, struggling everywhere. I can't think of an
area where we were effective."</TE>
<TE>   All of which points directly to the swinging gate. Or the
flea-flicker. The hook-and-ladder. Maybe even the old
statue-of-liberty play.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course we expect them to try different things," UCLA Coach Bob
Toledo said. "Different formations, a few new wrinkles. Gary Barnett
and his staff are good coaches. They'll have some surprises."</TE>
<TE>   In meetings and on the practice field, UCLA defenders have
reviewed trick plays and oddball sets. But they also are braced for
the Buffaloes' running game, led by talented tailbacks Chris
Brown--who six times has rushed for 100 yards or more--and Robert
Purify.</TE>
<TE>   "They run the ball good, don't let last week fool you," UCLA
senior middle linebacker Marcus Reese said. "They came into the
season regarded as one of the best running teams in the nation. We
have to be ready."</TE>
<TE>   No. 20 UCLA (2-0) is strong against the run. The front seven of
tackles Rodney Leisle and Sean Phillips, ends Rusty Williams and Dave
Ball and linebackers Reese, Brandon Chillar and Spencer Havner have
shined.</TE>
<TE>   Staring into the teeth of that defense will be quarterback Robert
Hodge, a senior transfer from El Camino College who made his first
start against USC. He'd like a restart after completing one of nine
passes for 20 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the problems can be chalked up to unfamiliarity between
Hodge and receivers. He had thrown only seven passes as a backup to
Craig Ochs, who will miss his second consecutive game because of a
concussion.</TE>
<TE>   "We just have to know each other better," Hodge said. "I have to
know what I'm looking for; they have to know what routes they're
going to run."</TE>
<TE>   Other problems stemmed from poor blocking. The Colorado line has
been shuffled because of injuries and three starting linemen from
last year's 10-3 team--tight end Daniel Graham, guard Andre Gurode
and tackle Victor Rogers--are in the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   And there was the poor play of the 5-foot-11 Hodge, who had hoped
to gain redemption against the two Southern California schools that
did not recruit him.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he is thinking survival.</TE>
<TE>   Hodge is regarded as an elusive runner, and it has been suggested
in Boulder this week that Barnett overhaul the offense and implement
the I-bone option--Colorado's signature in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "We put the option in about two springs ago, and we weren't very
good at it," Barnett said. "It's unlikely that we're going to put any
option in.</TE>
<TE>   "The option takes a lot of work. At this point in time, I don't
think we can devote the time to it."</TE>
<TE>   Sounds logical. Or is it a ruse worthy of Booty Jenkins?</TE>
<TE>   "We know how to defense the option," Bruin defensive coordinator
Phil Snow said. "Colorado State ran it two weeks ago against us. I'm
more concerned about mismatches and formations we haven't seen."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins had mixed results adjusting to Oklahoma State's
creative sets last week, winning, 38-24, but surrendering 444 yards
of offense. Only 94 of those were surrendered on the ground, however,
and Colorado would require the magic of Lance Burton to amass 359
yards through the air.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to be run-conscious, that's our first objective,"
Bruin safety Ben Emanuel said.</TE>
<TE>   With the last nonconference game at San Diego State next week, a
victory over Colorado would nearly assure UCLA of beginning Pacific
10 Conference play unbeaten for the third year in a row.</TE>
<TE>   A Buffaloes' victory would be more than an upset, it would be a
first. Colorado is 0-4 against UCLA, all of those games having been
played in the early 1980s. Barnett is 0-5 against the Pac-10, the
opposite of Toledo, who is 5-0 against the Big 12.</TE>
<TE>   So all signs point to a Bruin romp. But the Buffaloes were a
consensus top-10 preseason pick. They won 10 of 11 after an opening
loss last season and barely missed making the bowl championship
series title game.</TE>
<TE>   High expectations this year were dashed early by losses to
Colorado State and USC. They've been lampooned and discounted all
week. Their pride has been injured.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, it's not a particularly good day to face them.</TE>
<TE>   "I see what kind of athletes they have," Toledo said. "I know
better. When you have problems, you find answers. They will come here
ready to play."</TE>
<TE>   And security might check Barnett's sleeves on his way into the
Rose Bowl.</TE>

<TE>   WHEN UCLA HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Cory Paus completed eight passes of more than 20 yards
last week and is sure to go after an injury-riddled secondary that
has given up 257 yards a game through the air. If the Bruins take a
lead into the fourth quarter, though, they will rely on the ground
game. The offensive line--tackles Mike Saffer and Bryce Bohlander,
guards Steve Vieira and Eyoseph Efseaff and center Mike McCloskey--is
the strength of the team and has been especially effective late in
games. Kicker Chris Griffith hopes to get on track after missing
three of four field-goal tries in two games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN COLORADO HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   The Buffaloes will run, and run some more. They have little choice
because quarterback Robert Hodge has not proved to be a passing
threat. Chris Brown and Robert Purify rotate at tailback, and both
are effective. Brown has 323 yards in 64 carries and Purify has 104
in 24. Hodge is a threat to scramble and may run some option plays.
Derek McCoy averages 26 yards on six receptions and John Donahue
averages 21.5 on four, so damage can result on the infrequent
occasions Colorado passes. Punter Mark Mariscal leads the nation with
a 51.3 average, although he will be near sea level for the first time
this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO UCLA VICTORY</TE>
<TE>   1. Not falling behind early as the Bruins did in their first two
games.</TE>
<TE>   2. Slowing the Buffaloes' running game and forcing them into
passing situations.</TE>
<TE>   3. Not being surprised by gimmicks and trick plays that Colorado
employs to get points on the board.</TE>

<LD>Lovell Houston of Colorado waited three years to play in this game.
Now he'll watch on television from his Boulder, Colo., home.</LD>
<LD>   The senior transfer from UCLA missed 26 games because of injuries
and NCAA transfer rules before finally playing two weeks ago against
San Diego State. But a shoulder injury suffered in practice this week
will keep him from facing the Bruins.</LD>
<LD>   His brother, Marcus, is also out with an injury and also didn't
make the trip. But Marcus, a running back who was highly recruited by
UCLA three years ago, is a redshirt sophomore and can look forward to
next season, when Colorado plays host to the Bruins.</LD>
<TE>   Lovell, who transferred to Colorado after the 1999 season, has no
such luck. For now he must be content with the memory of making four
tackles as a nickel cornerback in the Buffaloes' 34-14 victory over
the Aztecs.</TE>
<TE>   "You get in the shower after the game and you've got little
scrapes and cuts stinging, and you don't even know where they came
from," he said. "The soreness was ... good to feel, because it was
from having done something productive on Saturday."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA linebacker Spencer Havner is a redshirt freshman, but he has
already earned a reputation for possessing great agility. Never was
it more apparent than when he returned an interception 23 yards for a
touchdown against Oklahoma State.</TE>
<TE>   The catch itself was nothing special--the ball was thrown right
into Havner's chest. But after building up a head of steam during the
return, he juked a defender at the five-yard line by coming to an
abrupt stop and changing direction.</TE>
<TE>   "He made it look easy," senior middle linebacker Marcus Reese
said.</TE>
<TE>   Havner is tied for second on the team with 13 tackles, eight
against Oklahoma State. He also has broken up three passes and forced
a fumble.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Northridge players scattered when the school dropped
football after last season. D.J. Hackett is one of the few who
upgraded, landing at Colorado. The junior is No. 2 on the depth chart
at wide receiver but has not caught a pass for the run-oriented
Buffaloes. At Northridge he had 100 catches in two seasons and at
least one touchdown catch in his last 13 games.</TE>
<TE>   At 6 feet 3, Hackett is Colorado's tallest receiver and could
create a mismatch against Bruin cornerbacks, all of whom are under 6
feet.</TE>

<HD>Fitzgerald Proves to Be Good Fit at UCLA</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Life wasn't bad for Tom Fitzgerald. After losing his job as coach of
Major League Soccer's Columbus Crew last year, he and his wife, Debi,
returned to their native Tampa, Fla., area and found a house in
suburban Clearwater just a field length away from the beach. Debi
opened an antique and consignment store. Meanwhile, the coach got his
real estate license and wasn't chasing potential job openings.</LD>
<LD>   "We were going to be fine," Fitzgerald, 51, said. "We were going
to be happy."</LD>
<LD>   Fitzgerald stayed close enough to the sport to monitor the latest
soccer news. He read the stunning announcement of Todd Saldana's
forced resignation from UCLA in January. A former coach at the
University of Tampa, he thought about returning to the college game.</LD>
<TE>   UCLA never came up in his thought process, though. That changed
when Associate Athletic Director Betsy Stephenson called. "In life,
you never know what's going to happen," Fitzgerald said. "You've got
to be ready for just about anything."</TE>
<TE>   Fitzgerald got the job in March over a group of finalists that
included former U.S. national team coach Steve Sampson and current
Loyola Marymount Coach Paul Krumpe. It was a surprise move that
Fitzgerald still wonders about. At the time, Sampson said he was
"very disappointed with their decision."</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I would be the underdog," Fitzgerald said of competing
against two UCLA alumni. "Steve had a tremendous reputation as a
coach and a great resume. To be honest with you, I wasn't sure I'd
get the job."</TE>
<TE>   The transition has been seamless. The UCLA men won their first
four games and are ranked third in this week's National Soccer
Coaches Assn. of America poll. On Sunday, the Bruins scored a 3-1
victory over recent nemesis San Diego, which had defeated them in
each of the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Fitzgerald takes the easygoing approach. He observes more than he
talks. At times, he jokes more than he instructs. Jorge Salcedo, the
former UCLA star and Galaxy player who has been an assistant the last
two years, said that approach worked immediately with the players.</TE>
<TE>   "From one to 28, he makes the guys feel like they can run through
walls for him," Salcedo said. "It isn't just the first six or seven
top players on the team.... I think Tom creates an environment where
everybody feels good about their personal game."</TE>
<TE>   Senior midfielder Ryan Futagaki said the Bruins quickly warmed to
this outsider.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of spring, [Tom] told us the style he wanted us to
play and then he let Jorge go ahead and coach us," Futagaki said. "He
wasn't going to come in and just start taking command and saying this
is his team."</TE>
<TE>   The transition was foremost on Fitzgerald's mind. Saldana was
successful at UCLA, going 60-21-5 in four years as both the men's and
women's coach. He led the Bruin men to the NCAA semifinals in 1999.
But the school decided it would not pick up his contract after
learning that he had a degree from an unaccredited university.</TE>
<TE>   Some didn't agree with the athletic department's decision. Many
felt abandoned. Uneasy feelings reigned.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little concerned," defender Scot Thompson said. "You
don't like having a coaching change going into your senior year."</TE>
<TE>   Salcedo said there were tough days after the announcement. "It was
difficult," he said. "Some of the guys had been with Todd for the
last three years. In the end, when you're no longer part of something
and the group changes, you feel a certain sadness and disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   "In saying that, though, things like that happen in life and you
have to go on."</TE>
<TE>   Thompson said the positive atmosphere surrounding the Bruins these
days comes from Fitzgerald and his decision to keep the coaching
staff intact, from Salcedo to goalkeeper coach Peter van de Ven and
volunteer coach Jose Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   In turn, Fitzgerald wants to keep his team unified, something that
Futagaki said hasn't always been the case with other talented teams
in previous years.</TE>
<TE>   "We have competition at every position," Fitzgerald said. "I want
guys to be mad when they're not playing because that motivates guys
to train harder.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't really concerned about what happened in the past, and I
told the guys that. All I care about is what we do from here on out."</TE>
<TE>   The only thing that could have made the beginning of his UCLA
coaching career better would be finding another place by the beach.</TE>
<TE>   "I drive by there every so often, though," he said. "Boy, the real
estate is high."</TE>

<TE>   For the first time in almost 18 years, the USC women's volleyball
team is ranked No. 1 in the nation by the American Volleyball Coaches
Assn. The Trojans (6-0), who sit atop both the AVCA and Volleyball
magazine polls, were last ranked No. 1 by AVCA on Oct. 16, 1984....
UCLA moved up to 11th in the national women's cross-country rankings.
The Bruins, who will run today in Hawaii, finished second to Stanford
at the Fullerton Invitational on Aug. 31.</TE>

<KH>USC vs. KANSAS STATE at Manhattan, Kan.</KH>
<HD>Trojans Need Special Effects</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MANHATTAN, Kan.</DL>
<LD>Before the season began, as he considered what many regarded as the
toughest schedule in the nation, USC Coach Pete Carroll said a 3-0
start would position the Trojans, "to do something special."</LD>
<LD>   Today, when 11th-ranked USC plays No. 25 Kansas State (3-0), the
possibilities for an extraordinary season could ride on the play of
special teams.</LD>
<LD>   Kansas State's units are living up to the name, having scored four
touchdowns in the last two games.</LD>
<TE>   USC's were anything but extraordinary last week against Colorado.
The Trojans gave up three blocked kicks, missed an extra-point
attempt and botched a punt return in a 40-3 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "Special teams are going to be huge in this game, and they have a
huge plus going on their side," said USC receiver and punt returner
Kareem Kelly. "We really emphasized correcting our mistakes in
practice. But we'll have to execute and focus on the little things
with our special teams to win this game."</TE>
<TE>   Kansas State has beaten Western Kentucky, Louisiana Monroe and
Eastern Illinois. The Wildcats caused seven turnovers and outscored
their overmatched opponents, 179-16.</TE>
<TE>   Danny Morris returned a blocked punt by Rashad Washington for a
touchdown, and Terence Newman scored on a 95-yard kickoff return last
week against Eastern Illinois. The week before, Newman scored on a
40-yard punt return and Kansas State scored on a blocked punt by
Morris.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't played anyone who is in the same hemisphere as USC, so
it's difficult to determine exactly where we are," Kansas State Coach
Bill Snyder said.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas State's option-oriented offense, which averages 414.7 yards
a game, is no mystery to USC.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Kansas State rushed for 340 yards and defeated the
Trojans, 10-6, at the Coliseum in Carroll's second game as coach.
Quarterback Ell Roberson rushed for 119 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Roberson, a junior, did not play last week because of a hand
injury. Senior Marc Dunn, who has passed for five touchdowns and run
for two, probably will start again, but the Trojans expect to see
Roberson in some capacity.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said the maturation of players such as defensive tackle
Shaun Cody and end Kenechi Udeze, who were freshmen last season, will
help the Trojans in the rematch. The Trojans lead the nation in total
defense, giving up 171 yards a game.</TE>
<TE>   "Guys that got knocked around don't get knocked around anymore,"
Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Udeze: "They ripped me pretty good last year, so I'm looking
to make a little bit of a statement."</TE>
<TE>   USC hopes to duplicate the balanced offense it showed last week
against Colorado when quarterback Carson Palmer passed for 244 yards
and the Trojans rushed for 181.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Justin Fargas, who gained four yards in his only carry, is
expected to join a tailback rotation that includes seniors Malaefou
MacKenzie and Sultan McCullough and freshman Hershel Dennis.</TE>
<TE>   MacKenzie caught a touchdown pass last week and rushed for another
score. McCullough gained 110 yards and scored on a 62-yard run.</TE>
<TE>   The offensive line will feature a different starting unit for the
third time in three games. Senior Zach Wilson will start at right
guard, replacing junior Eric Torres.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas State's defense, which is giving up 222.3 yards a game, is
led by defensive back Newman, and linebackers Josh Buhl and Terry
Pierce.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer said Kansas State would help prepare the Trojans for their
Pacific 10 Conference schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure there are many defenses in the Pac-10 that are as
good as this one," Palmer said. "We saw this look last year and we're
going to see it a lot this year, so we should be able to tell by this
game how successful we're going to be this season."</TE>

<LD>   WHEN USC HAS THE BALL</LD>
<TE>   Quarterback Carson Palmer completed 71.4% of his passes in the
first two games by sticking with short and medium routes. Tailback
Malaefou MacKenzie is a favorite target and showed his value again
last week against Colorado when he caught a short pass and broke four
tackles on his way to the end zone. Sultan McCullough rushed for more
than 100 yards for the 10th time and flashed his breakaway speed on a
62-yard scoring run. Now Justin Fargas joins the mix. Kansas State
senior cornerback Terence Newman is a Thorpe Award candidate and
special teams standout. Junior linebackers Josh Buhl and Terry Pierce
help anchor a defense that was untested against overmatched
opponents.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN KANSAS STATE HAS THE BALL</TE>
<TE>   Ell Roberson gave USC fits last season, running the option and
rushing for 119 yards in a 10-6 victory at the Coliseum. Roberson
missed the Wildcats' 63-13 victory over Eastern Illinois last week
because of a hand injury and Marc Dunn stepped in and passed for two
touchdowns and ran for another. Tailback Darren Sproles is averaging
7.3 yards a carry. Taco Wallace and Derrick Evans are the top
receivers. Linebackers Mike Pollard, Matt Grootegoed and Melvin
Simmons will be challenged by an option attack.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO USC VICTORY</TE>
<TE>   1. USC must neutralize Kansas State's big-play special teams and
eliminate breakdowns on its own units.</TE>
<TE>   2. Establish a running game. The Trojans rushed for 181 yards last
week in their rout of Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   3. Cornerbacks Darrell Rideaux and Ronald Nunn must prove they are
not weak links in USC's pass defense.</TE>

<DL>MANHATTAN, Kan.</DL>
<LD>USC is tied for first in the nation in pass defense, giving up 82.5
yards a game.</LD>
<LD>   USC cornerbacks Darrell Rideaux and Ronald Nunn acknowledge the
numbers are misleading.</LD>
<LD>   Auburn displayed a subpar passing attack and Colorado's was almost
nonexistent.</LD>
<TE>   Rideaux and Nunn expect they will be challenged for the first time
today when No. 11 USC plays No. 25 Kansas State.</TE>
<TE>   "Week in and week out you prepare for a test--you never know when
a pop quiz is going to come up," Rideaux said. "We've been mirroring
routes in games even though the ball hasn't been thrown that much. I
don't know how much better you can prepare than by going against guys
like Mike Williams in practice every day."</TE>
<TE>   Kansas State is averaging 242.7 rushing yards a game and 172
passing. Wildcat receivers are averaging 18.4 yards a catch.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to try to run the ball, but they have some pretty
fast receivers and they like to go vertical with them," Nunn said.
"We'll be ready."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kansas State has not lost a regular-season nonconference game in
10 years. It has been 13 years since the Wildcats lost a
regular-season nonconference game at home.</TE>
<TE>   USC, which beat then-No. 18 Colorado at Boulder last week, last
won road games in consecutive weeks in 1994, when the Trojans
defeated Oregon State and Stanford. The last time USC won consecutive
road games against ranked opponents was 1986, when the Trojans beat
No. 19 Stanford and No. 14 Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Today marks only the fifth time, and the first time in 14 years,
that the Wildcats will play a ranked nonconference opponent.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas State is 4-14-1 against Pacific 10 Conference schools but
won its last two games against Pac-10 opponents. The Wildcats beat
USC last season and defeated Washington in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A sellout crowd is expected today at 50,000-seat KSU Stadium. The
forecast is sunny with temperatures in the mid-70s.</TE>
<TE>   USC sold about 1,000 tickets for the game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC is 0-2 against teams from Kansas. The Trojans lost to Kansas,
26-20, in 1983, and to Kansas State, 10-6, last season.</TE>

<LD>A riot in an overcrowded Dominican prison left at least 27 inmates
dead and 48 others injured, 12 critically, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The riot erupted in the state prison in La Vega, 60 miles
northwest of the capital, Santo Domingo, after officials announced a
surprise sweep for weapons.</LD>
<LD>   Inmates stuffed mattresses and bedsheets through the locked prison
bars and set them ablaze. Prison officials tried to open the
cellblocks but were hindered by the flames, Atty. Gen. Virgirio Bello
Rosa said. Most of the deaths were from smoke inhalation.</LD>

reports from civilians in the area, an air force spokesman said.</LD>

<LD>Sergio Vieira de Mello, the new U.N. human rights chief, promised to
act as the voice of the world's oppressed but implied that he would
be less publicly outspoken than his predecessor.</LD>
<LD>   "My job will require speaking out to turn the world's attention to
abuses," Vieira de Mello said. "But it also requires tact and
political acumen, as well as the ability to roll up one's sleeves and
get down to work to protect human rights away from the spotlights and
the microphones."</LD>
<LD>   It was his first news conference since succeeding Mary Robinson as
U.N. high commissioner for human rights on Sept. 12.</LD>

<HD>China Releases AIDS Activist; Confession Cited</HD>
<DH>Asia: Wan Yanhai had posted an official document online. He
says that was a mistake.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU and ANTHONY KUHN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>An award-winning AIDS activist, whose detention by police for nearly
a month sparked concern and protest around the world, was released by
Chinese authorities Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Wan Yanhai was released by state security agents after what the
state-run New China News Agency called a confession by Wan that he
leaked state secrets by obtaining classified documents illegally and
passing them along to others, including overseas media. Contacted by
telephone in Beijing late Friday, Wan said that what he had done was
a mistake.</LD>
<LD>   At issue was an official report about the growing AIDS crisis in
the eastern province of Henan, a scandal involving illegal blood
donations that the local government has tried hard to cover up. Wan
posted the report on the Web site of his anti-AIDS group, the Aizhi
Action Project, and helped bring the crisis to the attention of the
outside world.</LD>
<TE>   The New China News Agency said Wan "confessed to his unlawful
activities, pleaded guilty and assisted the police in tracing
providers of the illegal secrets." However, he said in the telephone
interview that he had received the report from an unknown e-mail
address and was unable to tell security agents who had sent it.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a legal obligation to help the police. If I had known who
had given me the document, I would have given [that information] to
the police as a responsible citizen," Wan said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that he was in good health and had not been abused during
the investigation. But he declined to give further details of his
detention.</TE>
<TE>   Wan said he intended to continue his work in China fighting AIDS,
"but I need to learn a lesson from this, that I must do the work more
conscientiously in the future."</TE>
<TE>   A former visiting scholar at USC, Wan disappeared Aug. 24 after
attending a screening of a gay-themed film at a bar in Beijing. The
Chinese government did not confirm until Friday's news report that he
was being detained by state security agents.</TE>
<TE>   His disappearance and suspected detention drew international
concern and outrage--from his wife, Su Zhaosheng, in Los Angeles to
the human rights group Amnesty International to a Canadian
organization that presented an award to Wan for his AIDS work, which
Su accepted for him in his absence.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-AIDS activist group ACT UP helped stage a protest outside
the Chinese Consulate in New York on Thursday, and other ACT UP
activists threw fake blood onto a Chinese flag in front of the
Chinese Embassy in Paris earlier in the week.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials had raised Wan's case with the Chinese government.
His release appeared timed to remove a potential irritant from the
agenda for talks next month in Texas between Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The Beijing government is also eager to rein in any dissent in the
run-up to a crucial Communist Party gathering due to begin Nov. 8. On
Friday, a local court in the northeastern city of Changchun sentenced
15 members of the outlawed Falun Gong spiritual group to prison terms
of up to 20 years for hacking into cable TV networks.</TE>
<TE>   The court found the followers guilty of "using a cult to obstruct
law enforcement" and damaging broadcast equipment, the New China News
Agency reported.</TE>
<TE>   According to state media reports, the group used purchased
broadcasting equipment to interrupt prime-time programming in the
cities of Changchun and Song- yuan on March 5. In Songyuan, the group
reportedly commandeered the airwaves for more than two hours,
broadcasting a pre-recorded pro-Falun Gong videodisc to an estimated
160,000 viewers.</TE>
<TE>   In the three years since the government banned Falun Gong
following a demonstration by 10,000 adherents in Beijing, most
would-be protesters have been arrested or put under surveillance, and
the Chinese government claims to have largely vanquished the group.</TE>
<TE>   But the ongoing battle of words and images, waged via satellites
and Web pages, shows that the group is far from being eradicated in
China.</TE>
<TE>   It remains able to temporarily overpower or infiltrate state-run
media, employing far more complex tactics than those of other critics
of Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   Falun Gong claims that followers have staged nine such
incidents--which it calls "truth clarification programs"--since
January, although not all of those incidents could be independently
verified.</TE>
<TE>   The group, which blends yoga-like exercises and elements of
Buddhism and Taoism with the ultraconservative moral teachings of Li
Hongzhi, the group's U.S.-based founder, counts many scientists and
engineers among its worldwide following of millions.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's verdict sparked a further round of sparring between the
two sides' respective media outlets.</TE>
<TE>   "Falun Gong practitioners have no channels whatsoever to exercise
their constitutional right to freedom of expression," protested Falun
Gong's Web site www.clearwisdom.net following the verdict. "Under
these circumstances, they naturally have the right to insert their
broadcasts" into state-run television.</TE>
<TE>   "This sort of thing is just too wicked," Changchun resident Wang
Guilan, 55, complained to the New China News Agency about the
hijacked broadcast.</TE>
<TE>   "We were watching TV just fine when this thing popped up. It
ruined my mood for the whole evening and I couldn't even get a good
night's sleep," she said.</TE>

<HD>Plan Likely to Further Isolate U.S.</HD>
<DH>Policy: Some critics worry that other nations will see a
rationale to also strike preemptively.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Friday's blunt and uncompromising blueprint of President Bush's new
security doctrine is likely to further strain relations between the
United States and nations large and small that already complain about
America's dangerous tendency to go it alone.</LD>
<LD>   Critics say the doctrine's assertion of a right to stage
preemptive attacks on terrorists and rogue nations could be used by
Russia, India, Pakistan and other nations to claim a similar right to
self-defense in tinderboxes across their borders.</LD>
<LD>   Others worry the doctrine might strengthen the hand of Chinese
hard-liners who already believe that the U.S. is using its "war on
terrorism" as an opportunity to expand its military presence on
China's periphery.</LD>
<TE>   What is clear is that the mushrooming international debate about
when preemptive military action is justified and when it merely
cloaks aggression could complicate the administration's difficult
task of building a coalition against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "My impression is that the dominant people in the administration
don't really care much about offending allies," said Richard Betts,
director of the Institute for War and Peace Studies at Columbia
University in New York. "They are sure that they know the right thing
to do, and either get others to come along by pointing it out and
showing our resoluteness, or 'to hell with them.' "</TE>
<TE>   "It's ironic, because one of the things Bush had said during the
[2000 election] campaign is that if we're humble, others will respect
us, and if we're arrogant, they will not," said Joseph S. Nye, dean
of Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.</TE>
<TE>   Though there are differences of tone and emphasis from the Clinton
administration's 1999 security doctrine, which put more stock in
treaties and multilateralism, analysts found much historical
continuity in the Bush doctrine. Clinton did reserve the right to act
unilaterally and talked about "shaping the environment" with
commanding military superiority, Nye said.</TE>
<TE>   And the doctrine's pledge to make the U.S. military mighty enough
that no foe will attempt to equal or surpass it isn't particularly
new. "Since 1945, it's been our position that we will remain the
global and regional preeminent power," said Bates Gill of the Center
for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   However, said Nye, "that is speaking a fact about the way the
world is, but [the Bush administration has] underlined it and rubbed
people's noses in it."</TE>
<TE>   The most controversial aspect of the document released Friday is
its assertion that the U.S. must deal with the realities of
terrorists willing to use weapons of mass destruction by amending the
definition of "imminent threat" that has been used in international
law to justify preemptive strikes.</TE>
<TE>   "For centuries, international law recognized that nations need not
suffer an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend
themselves," the document said. " ... The greater the threat, the
greater is the risk of inaction--and the more compelling the case for
taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if uncertainty
remains as to the time and place of the enemy's attack.</TE>
<TE>   "To forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the
United States will, if necessary, act preemptively. The United States
will not use force in all cases ... nor should nations use preemption
as a pretext for aggression. Yet in an age where the enemies of
civilization openly and actively seek the world's most destructive
technologies, the United States cannot remain idle while dangers
gather." Foreign policy elites here and abroad were not convinced.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a devaluation of deterrence and containment, as if those
were 20th century ideas that are now outmoded," Graham T. Allison, a
professor of government at Harvard, said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "If something in the zone between preemption and prevention came
to be the general international understanding, you could see a
significant increase in the number of attacks," Allison said.</TE>
<TE>   These distinctions may seem academic to the majority of Americans,
who tell pollsters they support an attack on Iraq, but they are
crucial to the thinking of European, Russian and Chinese leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Many Europeans fear the Bush doctrine could encourage Russia to
claim a similar right to preemptive military action to defeat the
Chechen separatists it calls terrorists, and to defend southern
Russian regions from cross-border incursions being staged from within
Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   A senior administration official dismissed the idea that Russia or
India could credibly invoke the Bush doctrine to launch preemptive
strikes on Chechnya or Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't going to be considered a legitimate argument if it is
clearly a cover for naked aggression," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   "And that is a judgment that ... the world community will easily
make in a case where there's either an underlying political dispute
that could be resolved ... or where there are other means by which to
resolve the conflict."</TE>
<TE>   Russian President Vladimir V. Putin last week put the U.N. General
Assembly on notice that his security forces were preparing to expand
the war against international terrorism by launching preemptive
strikes against Chechen militants and their alleged foreign backers
taking refuge in Georgia's remote Pankisi Gorge.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials quickly shot down Moscow's plan with warnings that
Georgian independence and territorial integrity must be respected.
But the Bush administration will have mounting difficulties with the
Kremlin if it attempts to invoke its own right to preventive action
while denying Moscow's "me too" reaction.</TE>
<TE>   Russians are particularly sensitive about U.S. expressions of
military superiority, having lost their own superpower status since
the disintegration of the Soviet Union a decade ago. Russia tends to
react to U.S. displays of power with ominous reminders that it too
retains weapons of mass destruction .</TE>
<TE>   As a permanent member of the Security Council, Russia has publicly
refused to sanction a preemptive U.S. attack on Iraq until or unless
it gains assurances of a quid pro quo: U.S. acquiescence to a free
hand for Moscow in the roiling Caucasus.</TE>
<TE>   Russian Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov noted in Washington on
Friday that "Russia reserves the right, relying on the provisions of
Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, to take any necessary
actions to block the activities of these terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he stopped short of equating the two, saying that for the
time being, Russia will continue to "use all diplomatic and political
means" to resolve the conflict. And he suggested that the Bush
administration's proposed new doctrine of "preemptive self defense"
is essentially lone wolf in nature.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to point out that this preemptive strike doctrine
... relies on unilateral actions, and we in our efforts rely on
international mechanisms, including the United Nations Charter and
rules of international law," Ivanov said.</TE>
<TE>   Germans are highly sensitive about the use of military force
because of the abuses of power committed during the 12-year Nazi
regime, when invasions and territorial seizures leading up to the
outbreak of World War II were cast as preemptive moves to protect the
nation's security.</TE>
<TE>   German public opinion is so staunchly opposed to an attack on Iraq
that both incumbent Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and conservative
challenger Edmund Stoiber have been highly critical of the Bush
administration's campaign for the ouster of President Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Washington's new muscle-flexing on national security could also
prove counterproductive in prosecuting terrorism suspects. The German
Justice Ministry has already resisted providing assistance to U.S.
prosecutors seeking the death penalty against alleged hijack-plotter
Zacarias Moussaoui, on trial in Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder has characterized Bush's push for Hussein's ouster as a
military "adventure" planned by Washington that will undermine the
war on terrorism, further destabilize the Middle East and subject the
Western world to retaliation by Arab and Islamic nations.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Britain, Italy and Spain have lined up staunchly
behind the U.S. posture on Iraq and, implicitly, the new U.S. premise
of preemptive action.</TE>

<HD>Bush Describes Tough Foreign Policy Vision</HD>
<DH>Government: Doctrine submitted to Congress emphasizes the
need for preemptive attacks and reserves the right for U.S. to take
unilateral action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush formally laid out his strategic global doctrine
Friday, advancing "a distinctly American internationalism" that
asserts the right to launch preemptive attacks on terrorists and
regimes whose weapons of mass destruction pose a threat to the United
States.</LD>
<LD>   The president also declared his intention to dissuade potential
rivals from trying to equal or surpass America's military might.</LD>
<LD>   The toughly worded 31-page document pulls together the major
themes of Bush's foreign policy addresses in the year since the Sept.
11 attacks. It was sent to Congress to meet a 1986 law that requires
such an assessment from each president.</LD>
<TE>   But Bush's plan drew special attention because of the highly
charged atmosphere surrounding his administration's effort to enlist
the United Nations in a new confrontation with Iraq. He also used the
document to spell out his view of U.S. strategy in a post-Cold War
world where terrorists, rather than other superpowers, are thought to
pose the biggest threat to America. Bush made clear that he believes
the Cold War tactics of containment and deterrence are no longer
adequate to protect U.S. interests.</TE>
<TE>   "Traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a
terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the
targeting of innocents," the document said.</TE>
<TE>   "In the Cold War, weapons of mass destruction were considered
weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who
used them. Today, our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as
weapons of choice."</TE>
<TE>   Vowing to take unilateral action against perceived threats, the
Bush administration pledged to protect the United States and its
interests abroad "by identifying and destroying the threat before it
reaches our borders."</TE>
<TE>   "While the United States will constantly strive to enlist the
support of the international community, we will not hesitate to act
alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by acting
preemptively against such terrorists, to prevent them from doing harm
against our people and our country.... "</TE>
<TE>   By articulating an aggressive, go-it-alone-if-necessary doctrine,
Bush distanced himself from his recent predecessors, including his
father, the 41st president.</TE>
<TE>   "He's at the start of a new era," said Bruce Buchanan, a
presidential scholar at the University of Texas. "It's comparable to
what happened on President Truman's watch at the beginning of the
Cold War and containment."</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and other top administration
officials argued Friday that Bush's first-strike doctrine is a
long-standing U.S. option. But Buchanan disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "It is really a significant departure, not just from the
containment doctrine but from widely accepted American principles
such as: America will not strike first," Buchanan said. "And to
elevate it to the status of a doctrine--without incorporating
specific examples of a clear and present danger--that's a novelty.
It's going to take a while to sell it to the foreign policy
establishment."</TE>
<TE>   On Capitol Hill, some Democrats were skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) accused the Bush administration of
having a "political personality disorder."</TE>
<TE>   "They've moved from enforceable treaties as an American strategy
to military invasion as a nonproliferation strategy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.), a potential candidate for the
2004 Democratic presidential nomination: "I'm not at all convinced
that the new doctrine from the administration--which seems to ignore
the fact that we live in a globalized world where allies and
partnerships are more important than ever--will actually advance our
interests."</TE>
<TE>   Kerry termed it a "highly ideological doctrine."</TE>
<TE>   But Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) praised the Bush
doctrine, noting that it also stresses the need for alliances.</TE>
<TE>   "The notion is, preserving the peace requires us to work carefully
with the great powers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The national security policy statements sent to Congress by
previous presidents have been routine and have drawn little
attention, said John Lewis Gaddis, a foreign policy scholar at Yale.</TE>
<TE>   "There were really no definable crises forcing a reassessment of
the grand strategy," he said. "But Bush clearly is thinking about
revisions of the grand strategy."</TE>
<TE>   The forceful words in the document are also likely to rankle some
U.S. allies, who were already reluctant to join Bush's campaign
against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   There was little official reaction around the world to the
document as of late Friday. But the question of use of force against
Iraq has become a major issue in the neck-and-neck German campaign
for chancellor that culminates in elections Sunday. French and
Russian leaders have made clear their insistence on a multinational
approach based on international law.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's policy declaration was nearly a year in the making. The
process took on new significance after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, White House officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In defending the first-strike option, which a senior
administration official also called "anticipatory self-defense" and
"counter-proliferation," the document declared:</TE>
<TE>   "The purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific
threat to the United States or our allies and friends. The reasons
for our actions will be clear, the force measured, and the cause
just."</TE>
<TE>   In a background briefing at the White House, the senior official
highlighted two other major goals. One is to foster good relations
with other "main centers of global power" such as Russia, China and
India through multinational organizations such as the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, the World Trade Organization and the European
Union.</TE>
<TE>   The other goal is to emphasize "the benefits of democracy" by
promoting prosperity through free markets. As an example of that, the
aide cited Bush's announcement in March in Monterrey, Mexico, that
the U.S. would increase foreign aid by 50% over the next few years to
developing nations that commit to free trade, political liberty and
human rights.</TE>
<TE>   The official rejected criticism that the Bush administration is
too willing to go it alone.</TE>
<TE>   "The concerns about unilateralism, I just think, are unwarranted,"
the aide said. "Anticipatory self-defense is not a new concept."</TE>
<TE>   The aide added that the Bush administration would launch a
preemptive military strike only as a near-last resort. "It does mean
that there should be other methods that you pursue and use to try and
deal with those threats--diplomatic methods, counter-proliferation,"
the aide said. "There are all kinds of ways that you can try and deal
with threats. [But] there will be some cases in which much else has
been exhausted ... and it appears that you can only deal with it
through the use of military force."</TE>
<TE>   The president first sounded many of the themes in the document on
June 1, during a commencement address at West Point in which he vowed
to take "preemptive action" against the worst terrorist threats.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who participated directly in the crafting of that
speech were National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice; her deputy,
Steve Hadley; then-presidential counselor Karen P. Hughes and chief
speech writer Michael Gerson.</TE>
<TE>   The drafting of the document then continued. Bush and Rice worked
on it last weekend at Camp David, and Bush did some final editing as
recently as a few days ago, one aide said.</TE>

<HD>Britain's 'Good Cop' at the United Nations</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Complementing the U.S. is a specialty of veteran
Jeremy Greenstock.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAGGIE FARLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>In the intricate art of diplomacy, Britain has taken a page from a
more street-level realm of persuasion: playing good cop to the United
States' bad cop.</LD>
<LD>   The diplomat with that delicate brief here is Jeremy Greenstock,
an ambassador of the old-school, pinstriped-pants variety who began
his career 33 years ago in the Middle East and may retire this year
still dealing with the region's complications--particularly Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   In the effort to get the U.N. Security Council to confront
Baghdad, as in a range of other issues, it is Greenstock who quietly
serves a plate of carrots, while the U.S. ambassador stands by with a
big stick.</LD>
<TE>   "The U.S. delivers the power, and the U.K. delivers the means,"
Greenstock said Friday as the council continued discussions on just
how to handle Iraq. "It's an extremely complementary relationship."</TE>
<TE>   So, for instance, when President Bush challenges the U.N. to act
forcefully against Iraq or prove itself irrelevant, Britain
discreetly describes what action is possible and how. While most of
the Security Council's 15 members want to compel Baghdad to disarm,
they are loath to start a process that might lead to war.</TE>
<TE>   After Iraq's surprise agreement Monday to let weapons inspectors
resume their work in the country, the United States and Britain saw
their unanimous support on the council evaporate. Diplomats say
Greenstock has been especially effective behind the scenes in
rebuilding support, sounding out ambassadors and gauging how much
they might be willing to compromise.</TE>
<TE>   By Friday evening, it appeared that nearly all of the council
members were once again willing to consider a tough resolution
against Iraq early next week.</TE>
<TE>   "Since the U.K. is nowhere near a superpower, it must be more
persuasive in the way it does things," Greenstock said. "It's a
matter of marshaling arguments and having good relationships. That
does not mean that the U.S. cannot or is not doing that. But often
there is something that we can do it cannot."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Greenstock arranged a briefing on Iraq for the 10
members of the Security Council that are elected for a two-year
rotation and don't have veto power. The fact that the 10 are often
left on the fringes when the permanent five members--the United
States, Britain, China, Russia and France--huddle has been a point of
resentment in the past.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't push us," Jagdish Koonjul, the ambassador from
Mauritius, said after the meeting. "He just put it all on the table
and, at the end of the meeting, we seemed to be in agreement: Iraq's
noncompliance will lead to consequences. Next week, we talk about
what 'consequences' means."</TE>
<TE>   Next week's discussion will have grave significance. The only way
to guarantee Security Council agreement on a resolution is to somehow
sanction military action without actually spelling that out,
diplomats say. But it is the particular talent of British diplomats
to find a way out of a deadlock through the creative use of language.
In the case of Iraq, members who are reluctant to back military
intervention might find refuge in the words "material breach."</TE>
<TE>   That's a term of international law that the British team has
suggested including in the expected resolution on Iraq. A finding
that Iraq is in "material breach" of any of a dozen U.N. resolutions
would allow individual member states to take "necessary
action"--which could mean a military strike--to ensure Iraq's
compliance. Such language would allow cover for those countries that
don't want to explicitly back the use of force.</TE>
<TE>   This division of duties--conceptualizer and
consensus-builder--between the U.S. and Britain has developed over
decades at the U.N. While the nations' interests are not always the
same, they have built a basic level of trust that is rare in
diplomatic circles.</TE>
<TE>   "We often work together, and we work very well," Greenstock said.
But he was careful to point out that Britain is "not always the good
cop."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, despite his talent for diplomatic tact, Greenstock is
known for being refreshingly straightforward. He has criticized
Washington for not paying its U.N. dues--the U.S. still owes nearly a
billion dollars--and for abrogating international treaties.</TE>
<TE>   And Greenstock said that despite U.S. frustration with the pace of
getting a group of nations to agree, he doesn't think the U.S. will
take on Iraq alone.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. may lose confidence in the U.N. to deal with the most
difficult political issues," he said. "But there's no chance that the
U.S. will leave the U.N. behind--the U.N. is too important on too
many issues."</TE>

<HD>Germany Apologizes for Comment</HD>
<DH>Europe: Chancellor ex- presses his regret amid an
official's insistence that her Hitler reference in remarks about Bush
was misrepresented.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder apologized to President Bush on Friday
for any offense caused by a remark attributed to a German Cabinet
member comparing White House policy on Iraq to diversionary tactics
employed by Adolf Hitler.</LD>
<LD>   Justice Minister Herta Daeubler-Gmelin insisted that her comments
at a small preelection meeting were misrepresented, and Schroeder
said in his apology that he accepted her version of events.</LD>
<LD>   But the message delivered to Washington two days before Sunday's
cliffhanger national election here showed how sensitive the
relationship between the allies has become because of differences
over Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   Schroeder, head of the leftist Social Democratic Party, and
conservative challenger Edmund Stoiber of the Christian Social Union
are virtually neck and neck.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder's criticism of U.S. plans for an invasion of Iraq have
helped give him the an eleventh-hour surge after months as the
underdog. German voters are strongly opposed to any military strike
against Baghdad, especially one without endorsement by the U.N.
Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   The Schwaebisches Tagblatt newspaper quoted Daeubler-Gmelin as
saying Bush was posturing on Iraq to sway American voters.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush wants to distract attention from his domestic political
problems," she was quoted as telling about 20 trade union officials
in her home district in Baden-Wuerttemberg state. "That's a favorite
method. Hitler did that too."</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer termed the remark
"outrageous and inexplicable." Secretary of State Colin L. Powell on
Friday called German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer to ask for an
explanation.</TE>
<TE>   Daeubler-Gmelin rushed to Berlin late Friday at Schroeder's
insistence to explain herself to reporters.</TE>
<TE>   "It is absurd and slanderous to ascribe to me a comparison between
a democratically elected politician and Nazi leaders," the Cabinet
member and leading Social Democrat said. "I deeply regret that this
has thrown shadows on German-American relations."</TE>
<TE>   Daeubler-Gmelin added that she has "great respect" for Bush and
friends in the U.S. leadership.</TE>
<TE>   But Schroeder apparently feared her comments were insufficiently
contrite, and he sent his own apology directly to Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to let you know how much I regret the fact that alleged
comments by the German justice minister have given an impression that
has offended you," Schroeder wrote. "Let me assure you that there is
no place at my Cabinet table for anyone who makes a connection
between the American president and such a criminal."</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder's government, particularly Daeubler-Gmelin, has been at
odds with Washington over issues including the death penalty and U.S.
rejection of a new international criminal court's jurisdiction over
U.S. citizens. The justice minister has threatened to withhold
evidence from U.S. courts in cases where the death penalty is being
sought, such as that of Zacarias Moussaoui, an alleged plotter of the
Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Even 57 years after World War II ended in an Allied victory over
the Nazis, any political allusion to the Third Reich still sparks
controversy in Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Stoiber, the challenger, has accused Schroeder of endangering
U.S.-German relations for election purposes. But Stoiber jumped on
the bandwagon in recent days, suggesting in a TV interview Thursday
that he would deny U.S. military access to German bases if Washington
engages in unilateral actions against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder and his party closed a gap of as much as 8 percentage
points to post a slight lead over the opposition in polls released in
the last few days.</TE>

<HD>Israeli Fire Backs Arafat Into Corner</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Palestinian leader is trapped on one floor of
headquarters as surroundings are razed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MITCHELL LANDSBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Using dynamite and bulldozers, Israeli forces on Friday flattened
much of what remained of Yasser Arafat's headquarters and left the
Palestinian leader trapped on a single floor of his office building,
which was raked with machine-gun fire and struck by at least one tank
shell.</LD>
<LD>   The assault, which continued into this morning, was intended to
physically and politically isolate the Palestinian Authority
president after two suicide attacks on Israelis this week.</LD>
<LD>   Moving systematically, troops destroyed a few remaining ancillary
buildings before focusing their attention on the core of the Ramallah
complex. After knocking down a second-story pedestrian bridge that
connected Arafat's office to a building that housed many of his
guards, soldiers destroyed the stairwell in his building--leaving the
Palestinian leader unable to go up, down or out.</LD>
<TE>   Israel Radio said today that he was isolated to just a few rooms
with some aides and what it called "fugitives."</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of Arafat's guards and assistants surrendered during the
assault, which the Israelis said was aimed at arresting 20 men wanted
for alleged terrorism. The men did not appear to be among those who
emerged.</TE>
<TE>   Around midnight, Israeli gunners opened fire on Arafat's building,
strafing it with tracer bullets. One shell fired by a tank hit the
floor above the Palestinian Authority president.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Ruth Yaron, a spokeswoman for the Israel Defense Forces, said
those were "warning shots" designed to flush out the wanted men.
"This is putting pressure on terrorists who are sending suicide
bombers into the streets of Tel Aviv," she told CNN.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials insisted that they had not received an
official request for the men. Nabil abu Rudaineh, an Arafat
spokesman, denied having heard demands issued by Israeli soldiers
over loudspeakers.</TE>
<TE>   Among those being sought was Tawfiq Tirawi, the Palestinian
intelligence chief in the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   The siege left Arafat once again a virtual prisoner in his
quarters, confined to the only building left standing in what was an
extensive government compound. Adding to the sense that he was at the
mercy of the occupying troops, Palestinian officials said an Israeli
sniper shot and killed one of his bodyguards Friday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat was said to be unharmed. He has been confined to the
compound almost continuously since December, enduring challenges not
only from the Israeli army but also from within his own ranks.</TE>
<TE>   "He is used to this sort of horrible life," Abu Rudaineh said.</TE>
<TE>   The same could be said of many Palestinians and Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   The events of the last few days have shattered the fragile hopes
of many that nearly two years of unremitting violence might finally
give way to at least a tentative peace. Israeli and Palestinian
officials had been participating in U.N.-sponsored talks in New York
when a suicide bombing Wednesday ended a six-week lull in such
attacks on Israeli civilians.</TE>
<TE>   That was followed Thursday by another attack, aboard a bus on a
crowded Tel Aviv street. A 19-year-old Scot, Jonathan Jesner of
Glasgow, died Friday of wounds suffered in that assault, bringing the
death toll to seven, including the bomber.</TE>
<TE>   The bombings left many Israelis despondent. The resulting
crackdown on Arafat, accompanied by renewed curfews and an Israeli
incursion into the Gaza Strip, had a similar effect on Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "This has made the people even more hopeless and desperate," said
Obeida Barghouti, a Palestinian who was sitting in a neighbor's
backyard a few blocks from Arafat's compound Friday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli tanks surrounded and then entered Arafat's compound within
hours of the Tel Aviv bombing. Early Friday, the Israeli forces
destroyed 11 trailers that housed some of Arafat's staff and set off
an explosion that leveled the tattered remains of an intelligence
headquarters next to Arafat's office.</TE>
<TE>   As billows of white smoke and dust engulfed and rose over the
compound, shock waves rocked walls and rattled windows throughout
much of Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after noon, a blast took down another building in the
compound. A short time later, two Israeli army bulldozers and an
excavator could be seen finishing the job, clawing and scraping away
at slabs of concrete and twisted steel bars near Arafat's office.</TE>
<TE>   After Israeli troops destroyed the pedestrian bridge late Friday
night, they ordered Palestinians in the building opposite Arafat's to
surrender. More than 20 came out at that point, emerging into the
rubble of a courtyard in single file, hands above their heads. The
building in which they had been housed was then at least partially
knocked down. It contained a conference hall where Arafat had
delivered a speech to the Palestinian Legislative Council last week.</TE>
<TE>   By dismantling the stairwell in Arafat's building, the Israelis
left him stuck on the second floor. Abu Rudaineh, Arafat's spokesman,
said he feared that the office might collapse and warned that the
Israelis were courting "a big disaster."</TE>
<TE>   In the Gaza Strip, meanwhile, Israeli tanks on Friday drove nearly
to the center of Gaza City, the deepest incursion there since Israel
handed administrative control to the Palestinian Authority in 1994.
Israeli forces destroyed several metal shops they claimed were being
used as weapons factories but that Palestinians said made car brakes
and window frames.</TE>
<TE>   Two Palestinians were killed: a 35-year-old man, Ahmad Loubad, who
was described by officials and acquaintances as mentally disabled,
and a 25-year-old woman.</TE>
<TE>   In the town of Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, a 14-year-old
Palestinian boy was reported shot to death late Friday, apparently by
Israeli soldiers. A 20-year-old Palestinian man also reportedly was
slain.</TE>
<TE>   For the 73-year-old Arafat, the siege of his compound is the
latest in a series of setbacks that Israeli leaders hope signal the
end of his political career. Last week, his Cabinet resigned after it
became clear the Palestinian Legislative Council was about to pass a
vote of no confidence in his government. That helped fuel speculation
that Arafat's days are numbered.</TE>
<TE>   Although Arafat shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994 with two
Israeli leaders, many in Israel regard him as an unreconstructed
terrorist. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has made it clear that he is
unwilling to deal with him directly.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's government has blamed Arafat for the repeated Palestinian
attacks on civilians that began almost two years ago and have claimed
more than 600 Israeli lives. Arafat has argued that Israel, by
isolating him and imposing military control over the West Bank and
Gaza, has made it impossible for his administration to exert any
control over extremists. The Palestinians say they have lost more
than 2,000 people in the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's troops have kept Arafat under siege on and off for
months, and the prime minister declared Thursday that he intended the
latest assault to further isolate the Palestinian president. Defense
Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer stressed Friday that Israel was not
planning to deport Arafat, as some expected.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no intention of expelling him or firing at him,"
Ben-Eliezer said. "We want to isolate him."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli television reported Friday that the consensus among
analysts was that Arafat would be thrown out eventually, just not
now. The army has named its Ramallah operation A Matter of Time.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Rudaineh insisted Friday that Arafat, far from isolated, had
spent the day on the phone with a list of world leaders, including
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi
Arabia and King Abdullah II of Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. Security Council, responding to a Palestinian request,
called a Monday meeting about the violence.</TE>
<TE>   For moderate Palestinians and Israelis, who have spent years
waiting with dwindling hopes for peace, the latest events suggested
their goal was receding by the day.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless the Palestinians get rid of Arafat and come forward with
an incredibly far-reaching peace proposal, there's nothing that's
going to push this government off its present policy trail," said
Mark Heller, a researcher at the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies
in Tel Aviv.</TE>
<TE>   Walid Ahmad, a Palestinian banker and real estate investor, spent
Friday holed up in his apartment in Ramallah, unable to go outside
because of an Israeli-imposed curfew. He is no fan of Arafat, he
said, and is appalled by attacks such as the Tel Aviv bus bombing.</TE>
<TE>   But Ahmad didn't see much likelihood that the attacks would stop.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation we're in now is crazy," he said. "These Israeli
attacks radicalize Palestinian society, and they increase Sharon's
support in Israel."</TE>
<TE>   Peace, he said, seems ever more elusive.</TE>

<HD>Security Council Opponents May Feel Powerless to Wield Iraq
Veto</HD>
<DH>Strategy: France, China and Russia know that voting against
an invasion could backfire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Russia, China and France have made clear their opposition to an
invasion of Iraq by U.S. forces. But so far, the three crucial
members of the U.N. Security Council have not tried to agree on a
strategy for stopping the Americans.</LD>
<LD>   Diplomats and analysts in those countries say the three major
powers may be helpless to stop President Bush if he's determined to
go ahead. At most, the main opponents of a U.S. invasion can hope to
embarrass the United States by pointedly blocking any U.N. sanction
for military action.</LD>
<LD>   As permanent members of the Security Council, the three nations
can veto any resolution that comes before the body--as can the U.S.
and its chief ally, Britain.</LD>
<TE>   But they may feel powerless to wield that weapon if the U.S. seeks
the world body's backing for military action, for fear the Bush
administration will simply ignore the council's will--leaving them to
appear ineffectual and out of the good graces of the world's leading
military and economic power.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Bush spoke by telephone with Russian President Vladimir
V. Putin and met at the White House with Putin's foreign and defense
ministers, seeking support for a tough new U.N. resolution approving
the use of force if Iraq does not quickly accede to thorough weapons
inspections.</TE>
<TE>   Putin in his telephone call again insisted that U.N. inspection
teams first be allowed to do their work and determine whether Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein does in fact have banned weapons of mass
destruction, according to a Kremlin statement.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts emphasized that it is still too early to predict how the
diplomacy surrounding any attack will play out. There remains a
strong possibility that the three main opponents to U.S. action will
be brought around rather than risk a confrontation with the U.S. over
a regime viewed as probably doomed anyway.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, officials in the three nations play for time.</TE>
<TE>   "What is going on now is a complicated game, rich in mutual
bluff," said Russian defense analyst Ivan Safranchuk, director of the
Moscow Office of the Center for Defense Information. "The Americans
are bluffing, saying that they will submit to the U.N. a new
resolution on Iraq. Russia, France ... and China are bluffing that
they are going to veto this resolution."</TE>
<TE>   In actuality, Safranchuk says, "the last thing the Americans want
is their resolution vetoed. They'd rather deliver a military strike
without any resolution than with a vetoed resolution."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, he noted, Russia, France and China would like
to avoid vetoing a U.S. resolution, "which would be a re-creation of
a situation reminiscent of the Cold War era" when the world was
divided into sharply opposed camps.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Russia has been the most vocal permanent member of the
Security Council to oppose U.S. military action against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   France has been generally cool to the idea--but not as adamantly
as in past disputes with Washington. In fact, France has left open
the possibility that it might eventually agree to U.S.-led military
action.</TE>
<TE>   China, meanwhile, has stated opposition for the record, but has
spoken so softly that no one is paying much attention.</TE>
<TE>   Summing up the Russian position, Yuli M. Vorontsov, a former
Russian ambassador to the United Nations, said, "Diplomatic means are
preferable for resolving the situation, because in order to find out
whether Iraq possesses mass destruction weapons it is necessary first
to inspect Iraq's territory."</TE>
<TE>   However, he said, a ground operation "would be a real nightmare
for U.S. troops.... No one can predict what might happen."</TE>
<TE>   Vorontsov believes that Russia would veto any U.N. resolution that
seeks to validate a U.S. invasion of Iraq, though the Kremlin knows
realistically that Bush may well go ahead with war plans anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "If the White House decides to go ahead, there is no mechanism for
Russia to stop the Americans," he said. But he warned that "relations
between the U.S. and the rest of the world will immediately
deteriorate, perhaps past redemption."</TE>
<TE>   "Russia's only leverage is to veto, but even this is very weak,"
agreed Viktor A. Kremenyuk, deputy director of the Moscow think tank
USA-Canada Institute and a security expert.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Kremenyuk said, the Kremlin is just not convinced that
Hussein has to go and believes the Iraqi leader's removal would hurt
Russian interests in the long run.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein has been a good customer of Russian technology and weapons
and has given Russian companies access to Iraqi oil, he noted.</TE>
<TE>   "In a word, Saddam is Russia's client--and it would be a pity to
lose him," Kremenyuk said. "Replacing him with somebody else,
especially someone appointed by the U.S., would mean Russia's ouster
from Iraq sooner or later."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps more important, Russia would like to avoid an open breach
on the Security Council, which could cause the United States to act
alone, damaging the credibility of international diplomacy.</TE>
<TE>   "In that case, the U.N. is doomed," he said. "The only thing left
would be for the U.N. to close up shop--something very few countries
in the world are ready for."</TE>
<TE>   Like Russia, France is seeking to avoid antagonizing Washington
and pushing it into a corner. Unlike with other international
debates, in which France has led European opposition to the United
States, recent French policy on Iraq has been balanced and nuanced
and does not rule out the use of military force.</TE>
<TE>   France has worked hard to channel the Iraq issue through the
United Nations, emphasizing the need to adhere to international law.
Yet French diplomats seem willing to go along with a tough U.N.
resolution insisting on Iraqi disarmament and other conditions.</TE>
<TE>   A resolution that firmly reiterates the obligations of Iraq in
matters of disarmament ... [and] that maintains the pressure of the
entire international community on Baghdad could be useful," Francois
Rivasseau, the spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry, said
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   But the spokesman insisted that the use of force should be
addressed in a separate, second resolution if U.N. inspections do not
work or Iraq otherwise defies the international community.</TE>
<TE>   If at some point a U.S. military strike seems inevitable, analysts
say, they do not think French leaders will join the adamant
opposition expressed by Germany and other dovish governments.</TE>
<TE>   "The conversations now are about under what conditions France
could join a military effort," said Remy Leveau, a former diplomat
and expert on Middle East affairs at the Institute for Political
Studies in Paris. "The question is what do we do if they intervene."</TE>
<TE>   The French are unlikely to go as far as the leaders of Britain,
Spain and Italy, who would support U.S. action even if it bypasses
the U.N. Instead, France will push for a multilateral response that
has some justification in international law if not an explicit
endorsement by the world body, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   France has moved closer to the United States within the last two
years regarding the threat posed by Hussein. Nevertheless, French
policymakers worry that a regime change could create as many dangers
as the current problem, triggering instability in the Middle East and
setting up a precedent for "preemptive" attacks among bitter enemies
such as China and Taiwan. Already, Russia is making noises about
preemptive attacks on neighboring Georgia to hunt down Chechen
rebels.</TE>
<TE>   China also is of two minds. It is growing more and more dependent
on foreign oil to sustain its breakneck development, and it wants to
make sure its supply out of Iraq continues.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Beijing wants to avoid a collision course with
Washington just a month before President Jiang Zemin is supposed to
visit Bush in Texas. Improved Sino-U.S. relations are high on China's
diplomatic agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts therefore expect China to maintain a low
profile--essentially to hide behind whatever France and especially
Russia decide and to follow their lead.</TE>
<TE>   The one person who will probably get all three opponents off the
diplomatic hook is Hussein himself, said Safranchuk, who expects the
Iraqi leader to either obstruct U.N. inspectors or to be discovered
having cheated about weapons programs in the past.</TE>
<TE>   When that happens, "Russia and the others will be freed from the
need to oppose the U.S. military operation--and they can blame it all
on Saddam himself," Safranchuk said.</TE>

Shanghai and Maggie Farley at the United Nations contributed to this

<HD>Court Says Turkish Front-Runner Can't Run</HD>
<DH>Election: Ex-mayor of Istanbul looked like a shoo-in for
premier. But a 1998 conviction on a political charge leads to his
disqualification.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMBERIN ZAMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>ANKARA, Turkey</DL>
<LD>The supreme electoral board on Friday barred the candidate who had
been widely expected to become this country's next prime minister
from running in parliamentary elections. The move could slow Turkey's
drive toward European Union membership and cast a shadow over the
Nov. 3 balloting.</LD>
<LD>   The national board ruled that Recep Tayyip Erdogan, leader of the
Justice and Development Party, cannot run because of a 1998
conviction on charges of inciting religious and ethnic hatred. His
offense was publicly reciting a 90-year-old nationalist poem that is
taught in state schools.</LD>
<LD>   "It is a worrying sign that Turkey's avowed commitment to
democratic reforms is not matched by deeds," said a senior Western
diplomat who requested anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   Erdogan spent four months in jail and was stripped of his post as
mayor of Istanbul for reciting the lines that include: "Minarets are
our bayonets, domes are our helmets, mosques are our barracks,
believers are our soldiers."</TE>
<TE>   Turkey has a predominantly Muslim population but an avowed secular
government. People convicted of political or terror-related offenses
are barred from office.</TE>
<TE>   Erdogan argued that constitutional reforms enacted in August,
which were aimed at easing Turkey's entry into the EU and included
laws expanding the scope of free speech, should give him the right to
run. Former Justice Minister Hikmet Sami Turk, who helped draft many
of the changes, shares that view.</TE>
<TE>   "The shadow of politics has been cast over the justice system,"
Turk said.</TE>
<TE>   Erdogan, 48, began his political career in an openly Islamist
party but broke away last year to form his own centrist organization,
which includes former Islamists and secular politicians.</TE>
<TE>   The charismatic former soccer player has said he longer believes
in mixing religion with politics. His party favors joining the
European Union, maintaining strong ties with the United States and
sticking with a multibillion-dollar economic reform program that is
being backed by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.</TE>
<TE>   In a bid to appease his critics, Erdogan even pledged that he
would leave behind his wife--who wears the Islamic head scarf, banned
in state-run institutions--while attending official functions. He
also said that he would defer to the solidly pro-Western military
should Turkey be asked by the U.S. to take part in any operation
against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   It remained unclear Friday who will succeed Erdogan as party
leader, though speculation centered on his deputy, economist Abdullah
Gul.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts believe that Erdogan's exclusion might even bolster
his party's ratings by attracting sympathy votes. Recent polls have
indicated that the party could muster at least 25% of the national
vote--about 10 percentage points more than its most serious rival,
the pro-secular Republican People's Party. So fragmented is the vote
likely to be among the 20-odd parties running in the election that
there is a real chance Erdogan's group could rule with that level of
support.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect is deeply worrying to the nation's fiercely
pro-secular military leaders, who make no secret of their distaste
for Erdogan. The generals, who have seized power three times in the
last four decades, played a key role in pushing Turkey's first
democratically elected Islamist-led government out of office in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The military, along with many urban intellectuals and business
leaders, remains unswayed by Erdogan's professed change of views and
says he would try to make Turkey an Islamic state.</TE>
<TE>   In its ruling Friday, the electoral board also barred former
Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan and Murat Bozlak, leader of
the country's pro-Kurdish People's Democracy Party, from running for
office. Both also have convictions stemming from political or
terrorism crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Erdogan vowed to keep campaigning on behalf of his party and said
he will lodge an appeal with the European Court of Human Rights in
Strasbourg, France.</TE>
<TE>   "Even after the acceptance of many laws to abide by the standards
of the European Union, still the authoritarian mentality seems to be
lingering on," said Dogu Ergil, a political scientist at Ankara
University. "It's not enough to make changes. You need to believe in
them as well."</TE>

<HD>White House Finds Russia a Tough Customer on Iraq</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Bush apparently makes no headway in seeking
support for resolution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG and MAURA REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush urged Russia's top officials both in telephone calls
and in person Friday to support a stringent U.N. resolution against
Iraq but apparently found little success in softening their
resistance.</LD>
<LD>   Russian Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov did emphasize that Moscow
agrees Baghdad must comply with U.N. Security Council demands that
international inspectors be permitted a free rein to search for
biological, chemical and nuclear weapons.</LD>
<LD>   Privately, a senior Russian official said Friday: "I will tell you
frankly that if the United States decides to use force against Iraq,
we can do nothing to stop it. Our main goal is the elimination or
clarifying the situation around weapons of mass destruction, and in
this regard we are ready for full cooperation. If we fail to reach
agreement in this particular matter, we must do our best to ensure
that this does not endanger the positive direction of U.S.-Russian
relations."</LD>
<TE>   But it appeared that Bush made no headway in gaining support for a
tough new resolution that would authorize the use of force if Iraq
does not quickly accede to thorough searches. Russia, as one of the
five permanent members of the Security Council, can veto any council
resolution.</TE>
<TE>   The senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said:
"What we don't want is for someone to use a resolution [on use of
force] for some different purposes, such as to change the regime
there. This goes beyond any of the Security Council resolutions."</TE>
<TE>   Papering over the differences between Washington and Moscow,
Ivanov told reporters outside the White House that "Russia and the
United States firmly believe that the international U.N. inspectors
must return to Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference later, he suggested that Russia sees no need
for a new United Nations resolution until renewed inspection efforts
are given a chance.</TE>
<TE>   The United States and Russia have a "common interest in reliable
and comprehensive information on all problems associated with the
alleged existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq," Ivanov
said. "We believe that the best way to obtain this information is to
ensure the return of international inspectors to Iraq and the
beginning of their work."</TE>
<TE>   To counter Bush's push for a tougher U.N. stance toward his
regime, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein agreed Monday to allow weapons
inspectors to return to his country without conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's developments brought into focus the fluid relationship
between Washington and Moscow, in which each finds itself a suitor.
Russia is seeking a U.S. blessing for more aggressive action against
Chechen rebels taking refuge in neighboring Georgia. The U.S. is
trying to head off a Russian veto of a U.N. resolution to allow the
use of force against Iraq if Hussein doesn't completely open up his
arsenals and weapons laboratories.</TE>
<TE>   Bush spent 30 minutes on the telephone with Russian President
Vladimir V. Putin, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said,
and met in the Oval Office with Ivanov, the foreign minister, and
Russian Defense Minister Sergei B. Ivanov.</TE>
<TE>   Bush told Putin that the United Nations must pass resolutions that
are "firm, that accomplish the goals of disarmament and don't let
Iraq avoid responsibility," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   He said Bush was "encouraged" by the conversations and was
"confident [about] the ultimate outcome" at the U.N.</TE>
<TE>   Bush appeared receptive to Moscow's concerns about the Chechens in
Georgia, while stopping short of agreeing that Russia has the right
to launch a preemptive attack on Georgian soil.</TE>
<TE>   "The president stressed the importance of Russia protecting the
sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Georgia," Fleischer
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is taking a series of diplomatic steps intended to bring
recalcitrant members of the Security Council behind the U.S. position
on Iraq. Britain has made clear its support. However, Bush has yet to
obtain the full backing of the other three permanent members of the
council: France, China and Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Russia, which has significant economic interests in Iraq, wants
assurances that they will be protected or compensated if the U.S.-led
confrontation with Hussein results in war.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's chief concerns include a multibillion-dollar Iraqi debt
from weapons sales and tens of billions in potential oil production
contracts if the U.N. lifts economic sanctions. Moscow suspects that
U.S. oil companies are eager to shove Russian oil interests aside and
stake out territory for themselves in a post-Hussein Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said, however, that the topic was not raised during
Friday's discussions.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, just as the Russians sought after Sept. 11 to liken
the Chechen rebels to Al Qaeda terrorists, they now see an analogy
between Iraq and Chechen rebels in the Pankisi Gorge, a mountainous
area in Georgia that Moscow says the rebels use for attacks on
Russian soil.</TE>
<TE>   At his news conference, Igor Ivanov said the situation in the
Pankisi Gorge was a central topic of his discussion with Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Ivanov said Putin "has already stressed very clearly that if
actions of terrorists from Georgia against Russia continue, Russia
reserves the right, relying on the provisions of Article 51 of the
United Nations Charter, to take any necessary actions to block the
activities of these terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   But for now, the foreign minister said, Russia will continue to
"use all diplomatic and political means" to resolve the conflict.</TE>

<HD>His Success at Disney Isn't More Than He Imagined</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just out of college, Marty Sklar was overwhelmed to find himself as
Walt Disney's newest writer. Sklar, in awe of the charismatic
entrepreneur, didn't know what else to do but follow behind with pen
and index cards in hand, scribbling down Disney's orders, ideas and,
occasionally, one-line gems: Know your audience. Tell one story at a
time. Wear your guests' shoes.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't until many jobs later, and long after his mentor's
death, that Sklar recognized the treasure-trove of wisdom he had
started compiling at Walt Disney's elbow in the early 1960s. He
distilled it all into "Mickey's Ten Commandments," now one of the
company's most widely circulated creeds and a bible of the theme park
industry.</LD>
<LD>   The lessons became a cornerstone of Sklar's own iconic reputation
at Walt Disney Co., where he is among the last of a generation of
creative minds who worked with the founder--so closely in his case
that he became known as the Sorcerer's Apprentice.</LD>
<TE>   Today, Sklar is a sorcerer in his own right as the creative head
of Walt Disney Imagineering, the company's storied design and
development arm. The group celebrates its 50th anniversary this year,
a poignant milestone for the 68-year-old grandfather.</TE>
<TE>   "When people see Marty, they see Walt," says Imagineering
President Don Goodman. "When Marty says something is good, it's
almost like Walt says it's good."</TE>
<TE>   Sklar took on the role of handing down Walt Disney's pioneering
philosophy of family entertainment after the founder's death in 1966.</TE>
<TE>   "It actually affected me more than when my father died," says the
soft-spoken Sklar, who walks with stooped shoulders and sports a
boyish, mischievous grin. "I finally realized I never had to think
like my father, but in order to write for Walt Disney I had to try to
think like Walt Disney and use words that he used. It got so deeply
into that, it had a tremendous effect on me."</TE>
<TE>   Their relationship has guided Sklar during the last three decades
as he headed the creative development of Disney's theme parks and led
the company's ventures in the cruise business, interactive TV,
housing development and the redesign of Times Square in New York.
Sklar's imprint is on hundreds of attractions, from Space Mountain to
the new Flik's Fun Fair opening next month at the California
Adventure theme park.</TE>
<TE>   Sklar's role is more crucial--and challenging--than ever. Theme
parks, though reeling from a sharp drop-off in international tourism,
account for one-third of Disney's revenue. Sklar's job is a balancing
act of developing new and often expensive attractions while holding
the line on budgets that have grown tighter in recent years as
Disney's profit and stock price have declined.</TE>
<TE>   His most important role, though, is as anchor to a company
sometimes accused of drifting from its roots.</TE>
<TE>   "He was there from the beginning and walked in Walt's footsteps,"
says Disney parks and resorts chief Paul Pressler. "He has that
Jiminy Cricket consciousness."</TE>
<TE>   Jiminy presides over a decidedly quirky kingdom.</TE>
<TE>   The Imagineering group, whose name symbolized a blending of
imagination and engineering, was established by Walt Disney in 1952
to dream up Disneyland and create a physical home for Mickey Mouse
and other cartoon characters made famous on the silver screen. Writer
Ray Bradbury later would refer to it as a "true Renaissance
organization."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike their button-down peers in the swank corporate headquarters
in Burbank, the Imagineers work out of drab buildings in Glendale
where secrecy and security protocols rival those of military
installations.</TE>
<TE>   Sklar and his colleagues pride themselves on their unconventional
ways.</TE>
<TE>   Consider Joe Rohde, a senior creative executive who sports a
handlebar mustache and an elongated earlobe, stretched by a string of
shells and bones collected from his visits to tribal villages in
Africa, Thailand and Nepal. He once took a tiger on a leash into a
meeting with Disney Chief Executive Michael D. Eisner to illustrate
the allure of live animals. Stunned, and no doubt impressed, Eisner
gave the go-ahead for Walt Disney World's Animal Kingdom theme park
in Orlando, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Top creative leaders meet weekly with Sklar for brainstorming
sessions, where the agenda rarely is dull. At one recent meeting, the
creative team took turns sniffing vials containing foul odors for a
stink-bug character at California Adventure.</TE>
<TE>   Pitches can be equally unconventional. Two years ago, ride
designer Eddie Sotto flopped back in a chair, thrust his feet into
the air and blurted out his best impression of a space shuttle
takeoff. Impressed, Sklar championed what would become a $120-million
ride called Mission Space. The ride, designed with the help of
astronaut Story Musgrave and NASA, opens next year at Walt Disney
World's Epcot. "Sometimes it's very difficult to communicate an idea,
and you have to find a different method of doing it," Sklar says.</TE>
<TE>   Ideas often come from unexpected sources. After gazing at a snow
globe in his office, one designer dreamed up a ski-resort-themed
water park that would become the successful Orlando attraction
Blizzard Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Concepts quickly can give way to a frenzy of sketches pinned to
storyboards. Ideas are tested in the group's research and development
department, which through the years has tapped some famous
scientists, including personal computer pioneer Alan Kay. One of
their tools is a virtual-reality environment dubbed the Cave, where
holographic images are projected so that engineers can see their
handiwork before it is built.</TE>
<TE>   Many concepts never fly, such as Disney's America theme park in
northern Virginia (which was opposed by local residents) or Westcot
in Anaheim. Others, such as Mission Space, float around for years
before they take shape.</TE>
<TE>   "There are two ways to look at a blank piece of paper," says
Sklar, wearing a blue denim shirt with "Walt Disney Imagineering"
monogrammed in red letters. "One way is to see it as the most
frightening thing in the world because there is nothing on it, and
you have to make the first mark. The other way is to see the blank
sheet as the greatest opportunity in the world.... You can let your
imagination fly in any direction."</TE>
<TE>   Sklar's world is steeped in Disney. He wears a brass Mickey Mouse
ring and a Mickey Mouse watch with three faces so he can tell time in
Los Angeles, Paris and Tokyo. Sklar writes with a red pen, just as
Walt Disney did. On the wall, next to an original sketch of Space
Mountain, is a framed copy of a Disney quote: "When you believe a
thing, believe in it all the way. Have confidence in your ability to
do it right. And work hard to do the best possible job."</TE>
<TE>   Sklar reads it almost every day.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike his famously intense mentor, however, Sklar is unimposing
and low-key. Some of his apprentices liken him to the "Star Wars"
character Yoda.</TE>
<TE>   In meetings, he often sits quietly in the middle, not at the head
of the table, preferring to let others do the talking before weighing
in with a gentle "why-don't-you-try-this" suggestion.</TE>
<TE>   He gives his creative team a wide berth. He once encouraged his
artists to scribble their musings on what is known as the Graffiti
Wall. They obliged, producing some irreverent sketches that even
lampoon Disney executives.</TE>
<TE>   The nurturing style appears well-suited to managing a fiercely
independent culture where artistic egos often clash.</TE>
<TE>   "He's one of those very rare people who is not interested in
getting credit for anything and loves to see other people get credit
for what they do," says Disney Vice Chairman Roy Disney, Walt's
nephew. Yet "he has creatively influenced everything we've ever
done."</TE>
<TE>   Sklar looks for ways to invoke Walt Disney, such as during the
planning of Flik's Fun Fair, the children's area at California
Adventure that opens in October. Based on the Disney/Pixar movie "A
Bug's Life," Flik's includes five attractions for children and
parents, a key change in design Sklar insisted on in deference to
Disney.</TE>
<TE>   "I reminded everyone that the reason Disneyland existed at all was
because Walt used to take his daughters, Diane and Sharon, to the
Griffith Park merry-go-round ... and Daddy had to sit on the park
bench eating peanuts and popcorn while the kids rode alone."</TE>
<TE>   Another Walt principle he often recites: The smallest details
count.</TE>
<TE>   Like how to make a 25-foot steel-and-fiberglass canopy resemble a
bed of clover. Sklar ordered the first batch, part of the Flik's
area, repainted a lighter shade of green to appear more authentic.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really the details that convince people of the story they're
in," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Handing down such lessons comes naturally to Sklar, whose father
was a teacher and who served on Anaheim's school board.</TE>
<TE>   For all his faithfulness to Walt Disney, however, Sklar also is a
pragmatist and a survivor who can adapt to changing fiscal realities
and bosses. In recent years Sklar has guided the division through a
rocky period, when it came under fire for costly delays. Several
hundred jobs were cut and the group restructured to be more fiscally
accountable. In a new round of streamlining, the group's research and
development department told employees this week that it would cut
about two dozen positions.</TE>
<TE>   Sklar's team doesn't always hit the mark. Disney's most recent
U.S. theme park, California Adventure, continues to struggle from
lackluster attendance.</TE>
<TE>   "He defended it greatly, even though I think privately he must
have realized its shortcomings," says Disney historian David Koenig.</TE>
<TE>   It's a sensitive subject for Sklar. He complained to organizers of
an industry awards ceremony last year after the host, actor Thomas
Wilson, who played Biff in the "Back to the Future" movies, jokingly
compared the park to a church carnival.</TE>
<TE>   Sklar says it's still too early to judge the $1.4-billion project
because it opened in a down economy.</TE>
<TE>   "Once [the park] gets some of these new attractions, it's going to
be different park, more in line with other Disney parks," he says,
noting that along with Flik's, a thrill ride, Tower of Terror, will
be added. "Theme parks are living things. They can be manipulated,
changed and grow."</TE>
<TE>   It's a lesson Sklar learned long ago, shortly after his first
encounter with Walt Disney in an office tucked behind Main Street. It
was just two weeks before the opening of Disneyland in July 1955.
Construction crews worked frantically to finish buildings and rides
and furnish shops and restaurants. Sklar, who grew up in Long Beach,
had just started a summer job. He was about to give Disney a
10-minute presentation on how he would create a Disneyland newspaper
for Main Street.</TE>
<TE>   "I was frightened. Here I was 21 years old, had never worked
professionally," recalls Sklar, then a junior at UCLA, where he
worked for the Daily Bruin newspaper. "He had time for even the
smallest detail, like my newspaper."</TE>
<TE>   The Disneyland News, it turns out, was the least of Disney's
problems on opening day. Fountains didn't work. Rides broke down.
Women got their heels stuck in wet asphalt.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people had a horrible time at the opening," Sklar says. "It
was a mess."</TE>
<TE>   But it also was an opportunity for Sklar. He returned a year
later, after graduation, to write marketing and sales brochures for
Disneyland. Impressed with Sklar's writing skills, Walt Disney soon
promoted him to Imagineering's predecessor, WED Enterprises. There,
Sklar and his colleagues developed shows for the 1964-65 New York
World's Fair, which included versions of future Disney attractions
such as It's a Small World.</TE>
<TE>   The experience catapulted Sklar into Walt Disney's inner circle.
He prepared scripts for the founder's news conferences and television
appearances and wrote the annual message to shareholders. That's when
Sklar began taking notes on Disney's business philosophy.</TE>
<TE>   As Disney and his lieutenants secretly bought up thousands of
acres of swampland in central Florida in the mid-1960s, Sklar
prepared the speeches and presentations that his boss would give at
key meetings with Florida politicians, who later would grant Disney
and his brother Roy extraordinary powers to build an East Coast
Disneyland.</TE>
<TE>   "There was nothing there," Sklar says. "Nobody went to central
Florida on vacation when we started that project. We had to create a
resort destination."</TE>
<TE>   Sklar quickly learned to apprise his boss of the smallest details.
As part of the sales pitch to the Florida Legislature, Sklar created
a 20-minute movie on the history of the company and its founder.
Disney, however, was irritated that he hadn't seen the script
earlier. "After a special screening ... Walt came up to me and said,
'I didn't realize anyone was writing my own obituary.' "</TE>
<TE>   Still, Disney still liked the presentation enough to ask Sklar to
develop a 25-minute film on Epcot, the quixotic future community he
envisioned as a showcase for American industry and urban planning. It
was their last project before Disney's death in 1966.</TE>
<TE>   "Walt created a revolution. Marty was there and caught the spirit
of it and has carried it on ever since," says Buzz Price, founder of
the theme park consulting firm Economics Research Associates.</TE>
<TE>   After becoming creative leader in 1974, Sklar guided the creation
of eight theme parks on three continents that today draw more than 50
million visitors a year.</TE>
<TE>   Boosted by Eisner and then- Disney President Frank Wells, the
group's payroll grew from 400 in the 1980s to more than 2,500 by the
late 1990s. Employment has since fallen to 1,600 as the pace of work
has ebbed, but another rally is expected as Disney builds a theme
park in Hong Kong and plans a second park in China.</TE>
<TE>   Remembering the chances Walt Disney gave him, Sklar through the
years has recruited young, often inexperienced talent to build his
team.</TE>
<TE>   "If you talk to every one of the creative leaders ... they will
all tell you they got their break from him," says Imagineering
Executive Vice President Tom Fitzgerald, Sklar's heir apparent, whom
Sklar hired out of college in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   Sklar speaks of his apprentices with the pride of a father,
expressing confidence that Walt Disney's vision is in good hands.</TE>
<TE>   "I think so much of the talent here, many of whom I personally
hired, as kind of like my kids. And my kids have grown up and they
really know how to do it."</TE>

<HD>Short List Creates Divide in the Ranks of LAPD</HD>
<DH>Chief: New recruits look forward to new era under an
outsider. Brass and some veterans feel the sting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER and TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Police Department is home to 9,000 police officers,
from the 39 newest graduates of the academy to veterans whose
experience includes some of the best and worst times in the storied
department's history.</LD>
<LD>   As news of the Police Commission's decision to tap three outside
candidates as finalists to lead the LAPD spread Friday, the rank and
file absorbed the names with reactions that often varied by tenure
and rank.</LD>
<LD>   For some of the LAPD's most senior officials, the list--William
Bratton, former New York police commissioner; Art Lopez, chief of the
Oxnard Police Department; and John Timoney, former Philadelphia
police commissioner--was a blow to career ambitions nurtured over
decades. And those officers were stung by the omission of anyone
currently in the department, including any one of them.</LD>
<TE>   For new recruits, by contrast, the rejection of the LAPD's own
candidates carried no particular weight, and the prospect of a new
dawn for the Police Department inspired confidence.</TE>
<TE>   And for those in the middle ranks who have worked through the
department's difficulties and relished its bright moments, the
candidates for chief produced a more complicated set of reactions.
Some worried that it reflects a loss of confidence by the city
leadership in their work, and several said they hope Mayor James K.
Hahn will pick Lopez, the only one of the finalists who has
experience with the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   The generational split was evident at the Police Academy in
Elysian Park, where deputy chiefs and other commanders gathered for
the graduation of the LAPD's newest class.</TE>
<TE>   Before the graduates accepted their honors, however, a group of
the top brass assembled inside for a subdued breakfast, punctuated by
flashes of dark humor. One deputy chief was told he should have gone
to New York for a couple months before applying for the top job.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe in the upper ranks there will be some disappointment," said
Capt. Sharyn Buck, "but you know what? It will be a good person,
because the commission is doing their best. I know they are."</TE>
<TE>   The unhappiness of LAPD's senior management was expressed
privately as well. When the decision was made Thursday, detectives
and commanders in Parker Center, the police headquarters downtown,
said doors began closing on the sixth floor--where the top brass have
offices.</TE>
<TE>   Former Deputy Chief William Rathburn, who lives in Texas, said his
phone started ringing within hours of the announcement. Rathburn said
some of the calls were from former LAPD associates grousing that he
should have applied for the job--at least then, they complained, an
LAPD veteran who shared their sense of the department might have made
the cut.</TE>
<TE>   To several of the new graduates, who tossed their caps into the
air after the ceremony, it matters more that they are part of the
LAPD than who is selected to lead them.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just so pumped up right now because I'm here," said Police
Cadet Wayne Edwards. "When you go out there and look at all the
different organizations, this is the one that has the best
opportunities.... I'm LAPD, and I will follow what I've gotta do."</TE>
<TE>   Away from the gloom of the brass and the ebullience of the new
officers, police across the city expressed more nuanced views of the
future.</TE>
<TE>   Many expressed concerns about a newcomer to Los Angeles, a
prospective chief who would not even know his way around the city,
let alone the department. Others acknowledged that the LAPD has
brought some discredit onto itself and said they appreciated the
commission's desire to bring in fresh leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "My sincere question is, who does the new chief turn to for an
honest answer to the question: 'Who's who in the zoo?' " said Capt.
Joseph Curreri. "That's the dilemma."</TE>
<TE>   Curreri, echoing the view of many interviewed, said the new chief
should set a positive tone with the rank and file and ease into his
agenda rather than attempting major reforms overnight.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it would be a mistake for any chief to come in here
hard-nosed and say, 'There are a lot of problems in this organization
and you people are all part of them,' " Curreri said. "He needs to be
tactful in the approach and not come in thinking everybody's a jerk,
because we're not."</TE>
<TE>   Officer Todd Clease, who patrols the Southwest Division, was among
those to say they believe a new chief could be a refreshing change.</TE>
<TE>   "We need more than just a manager," Clease said. "We need someone
who is a true leader, who understands where we are now and who has a
vision for where we need to go in the future."</TE>
<TE>   At the LAPD's Hollenbeck Division, in one of the oldest sections
of the city, support on the street seemed to be growing for Lopez, a
former LAPD official who left to lead a small-town department. Though
Mayor James K. Hahn emphasizes the need to hire a chief who can
change the culture of the LAPD, several officers were worried about
the prospect of a chief who did not come up through their ranks.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez was their favorite.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the perfect choice," said Senior Lead Officer Vincent
Rodriguez. "The guy bleeds LAPD."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez, 41, worked under Lopez when Lopez was a commander at
LAPD's Central Bureau. Rodriguez praised Lopez's people skills, but
said the time Lopez spent with the LAPD will be the most important
factor for many officers in deciding whom to support.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is we want someone from the inside, someone who will
understand the [LAPD] culture because he's been there himself,"
Rodriguez said.</TE>
<TE>   Both Timoney and Bratton enjoy higher national profiles than
Lopez, whose reputation is familiar mostly within the ranks of the
LAPD. But some officers said that although reputation counts, a new
chief's success will depend at least as much on how he is embraced by
the department's rank and file.</TE>
<TE>   "We've dealt with outsiders before," said Officer Fred Celis, a
motorcycle officer, as he checked over his bike. "[Willie] Williams
was a good chief, but he was never well-liked because he was from the
outside."</TE>
<TE>   One officer, however, said the support for Lopez is evidence of a
culture of insularity that the department needs to move away from.</TE>
<TE>   "The LAPD has been the way it is now for years, and the only way
to change it is to have someone come in from the outside," said Sgt.
Jesse James, 45, who has worked for the department for 22 years.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said he called the six candidates who currently work in the
LAPD on Friday to reassure them and tell them he would like them to
be part of the department's new management team.</TE>
<TE>   However, the new City Charter, enacted late in the administration
of Hahn's predecessor, Mayor Richard Riordan, allows an incoming
police chief to name his own top deputies.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor sought input from advisors and other associates and was
briefed by his top staff in advance of his interviews with the three
finalists next week.</TE>
<TE>   His staff also reached out to leaders of the Police Protective
League, who had expressed initial shock and dismay that no one from
within the ranks made the final cut.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, those leaders struck a more conciliatory tone.</TE>
<TE>   "We encourage the mayor to carefully review the backgrounds and
plans of each of the candidates submitted to him by the Police
Commission," league President Mitzi Grasso said in a statement.
"Earlier in the year, the mayor showed great leadership by choosing
not to reappoint the troubled former chief."</TE>

Glover contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Together, Yet Going It Alone</HD>
<DH>Joined at the head, 41-year-old twins discover ways to
nurture two rich--and utterly different--lives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>READING, Pa.</DL>
<LD>Lori Schappell has spent her entire life connected to her twin
sister, Reba, at the side of the forehead, with Lori facing one
direction and Reba the other. Because Reba is 4 inches shorter and
suffers from spina bifida, Lori wheels her sister around on a stool
wherever they go.</LD>
<LD>   The miraculous surgery that separated Guatemalan twins in Los
Angeles this summer was not possible when the Schappells were
children.</LD>
<LD>   Lori, for one, has no complaints.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't believe in separation," she said. "I think you are
messing with God's work."</TE>
<TE>   At UCLA, doctors say the $1.5-million separation has given Maria
de Jesus and Maria Teresa Quiej Alvarez their only chance at a normal
life. But Lori Schappell said that she and her sister have found a
way to fit two rich--and utterly different--lives into what many
others view as essentially one body.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Lori worked in a hospital, leaving Reba to sit for
hours with a book while Lori packed medical instruments. Lori has
since quit her job and now silently accompanies Reba on stage as her
sister pursues a career as a country singer.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't wake up thinking, 'Oh, I'm a conjoined twin,' " Lori
said, maneuvering her body as she speaks so her sister can reach a
glass of water. "I have two arms and two legs. I'm just a regular
person.... I live a normal life."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Lori and Reba turned 41, making them among the
oldest pair of conjoined twins in the United States. Another pair,
Yvonne and Yvette McCarther, were born and raised in Los Angeles
County, attended Compton Community College and died together at age
43 nearly a decade ago. Conjoined twins Ronnie and Donnie Galyon, who
are 50 and live in Ohio, do not like to talk to the media, according
to a relative.</TE>
<TE>   That means any time conjoined twins are in the news, as they were
this summer with the Guatemalan girls, Lori and Reba's phone starts
ringing with reporters asking for interviews.</TE>
<TE>   The sisters have appeared on "The Jerry Springer Show" and other
TV programs, as well as in the Globe tabloid. They say they now shy
away from the media, saying there have been too many questions about
sex and too many stories that left them feeling exploited by the
modern version of a traveling sideshow.</TE>
<TE>   There's also Reba's career as a country singer to think about,
Lori said. These days, Reba refuses interviews, greeting journalists
with only a polite Mona Lisa smile.</TE>
<TE>   Lori, however, believes interviews are a public service, a way to
show that conjoined twins are like everybody else. No matter how many
times she says it, the lesson doesn't seem to sink in.</TE>
<TE>   "In America, we think you can't be an individual and be joined,"
said Alice Dreger, a professor at Michigan State University and
author of "The Limits of Individuality: Ritual and Sacrifice in the
Lives and Medical Treatment of Conjoined Twins."</TE>
<TE>   "We think what it means to be an individual is to have a body that
is never dependent on another human being.... But if you listen to
them, they say they are individuals ... and we should take seriously
what they say."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the history of conjoined twins, she said, there is not
one case in which twins old enough to decide for themselves went
through with a separation.</TE>
<TE>   Will Degeraty, a grandfather of formerly conjoined 6-year-olds and
the founder of a support group for parents of conjoined twins, said
separation, if possible, is the answer.</TE>
<TE>   "Take our twin granddaughters," he said. "If they would have left
them conjoined, it would be terribly miserable on them, and on their
parents."</TE>
<TE>   Lori is faultlessly polite, but this sentiment pushes her chin up
in anger, carefully though, as to not to jerk her sister.</TE>
<TE>   "Do not ask us ever again," she said. "We won't be separated.
We're fine."</TE>
<TE>   The only exception, she adds in a matter-of-fact way, will be when
one of them dies. At that point, a separation operation would be
necessary to save the other twin. Doctors at UCLA who performed the
separation of the Guatemalan twins said such a separation is
theoretically possible, although each case is different.</TE>
<TE>   Compromise as Instinct</TE>
<TE>   On a typical morning, Lori, always a sporadic sleeper, wakes
first. She tries not to move her head, but her restless arms and legs
jiggle the blankets and signal Reba.</TE>
<TE>   When you are joined to another person, compromise--in your
movement, in how you spend your time and with whom--becomes as
instinctual as breathing.</TE>
<TE>   The sisters share a double mattress, with Lori laying lengthwise
while Reba and her pet Chihuahua sleep kittycorner.</TE>
<TE>   The bed is tucked into a corner of a sunny living room on the 15th
floor of a senior living facility with a view of green rolling hills.
Through the window, the land curving around the Schuylkill River
mirrors the shape of the twins' faces, pressed together at the top so
Lori's left eye merges into Rita's right and sloping away from each
other so each chin faces in an opposite direction.</TE>
<TE>   Lori prefers to shower in the evening while Reba likes to start
the day fresh. In the morning, Lori wheels Reba to the bathroom--and
after years of practice, the twins have a way for Reba to get clean
while Lori stays dry. In the evenings, the procedure is reversed.</TE>
<TE>   All day they perform such choreographed concessions, allowing each
woman a measure of independence.</TE>
<TE>   Lori likes to eat in restaurants, while Reba gets food to go and
eats at home. Lori is a shopper, dawdling at displays. Reba makes a
list and is in and out of stores in a flash. Money flies through
Lori's fingers, while Reba saves every penny. Lori throws on whatever
is comfortable. Reba carefully selects outfits to complement her
country music aspirations. Her hair is dyed auburn; Lori's is light
brown.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a spur-of-the-moment person, and Reba plans everything," Lori
said. "We're so different, it's not even funny."</TE>
<TE>   In this, the Schappells resemble many sets of twins who emphasize
their differences to a world fascinated by their similarities.</TE>
<TE>   Lori, for one, dismisses as "absurd" the notion that twins can
sense each other's pain or read each other's minds. Take the time
Lori sped through the kitchen door and accidentally slammed Reba's
elbow into the wall, breaking it with a loud, awful smack.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't feel her pain," she said. "I heard the crack."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other twins, only Lori can walk, and wherever she goes,
Reba must follow. Reba calls Lori "Mommy."</TE>
<TE>   Lori, who said her only goal in life is to marry and have
children, fusses over her twin. Reba makes requests in a soft voice
only Lori can understand, and the sisters spring into a blur of
motion as Lori fetches a glass of water and turns up the radio for
Reba's favorite country singer.</TE>
<TE>   Lori quit her job in 1996, she said, and Reba's career began to
take off. She takes care of the house--cooking; cleaning; and feeding
Reba's two pets, the Chihuahua, Mimi Jackson (after country music
star Alan Jackson) and a fish called George.</TE>
<TE>   Reba takes the lead in other ways. She pushed for the women to
join the larger world. Reba never was much bothered by the gasps,
whispers and double takes, but sometimes Lori squirmed under the
world's gaze, she said.</TE>
<TE>   When Reba wanted to attend college, Lori was filled with anxiety.</TE>
<TE>   "I had everything done for me," Lori said. "All of a sudden, I was
out on my own. We weren't living with anyone. I was taking care of
everything."</TE>
<TE>   After the first year, Lori wasn't sure she wanted to return. But
walking into the dorm, she looked at the pay phone and took a deep
breath.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, I can do this," she said. "I can worry. I can get
upset or cry. But I have a phone right there, and I can call Mom if I
need to."</TE>
<TE>   Lori trained as a ward clerk and hasn't looked back. Reba studied
medicine, but dropped it to pursue country music.</TE>
<TE>   When Lori and Reba were born in Reading in 1961 to their shocked
parents, doctors gave them a year to live.</TE>
<TE>   "Then he put it up to we won't live past 2, or we won't live past
3," Lori said. "Each year he was wrong. We were saying the other day,
if he could see us now, we're ... 41 and we're still here."</TE>
<TE>   She declined to speak much about her family, except to say that
she and Reba are among eight siblings from a loving and religious
family.</TE>
<TE>   Shrugging Off Stares</TE>
<TE>   Separating babies joined at the head was not possible when they
were born, Lori said. Their parents taught them to shrug off the
stares, saying you look different to other people but to us you're
just like our other children.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors convinced the girls' parents to put them in an
institution, where they lived for 21 years. "We don't talk about that
stuff," Lori said. "That was not anything anyone had any control
over."</TE>
<TE>   When Lori finished college, the sisters moved into their
apartment. They make frequent visits to family but have lived alone
for nearly 16 years.</TE>
<TE>   Although their bodies are joined, the Schappells' apartment is
carved up to give each woman her own space.</TE>
<TE>   The front room is Lori's. Except for Reba's spotless desk, it
bursts with Lori's clutter. There is a catalog of pet products, an
accounting textbook left over from college.</TE>
<TE>   There also are books relating to her interest in finding a
husband. "The Idiot's Guide to Dating," is marked at a chapter called
"Dating Disasters."</TE>
<TE>   Lori laughed and said that just because she's a conjoined twin
doesn't mean she can't have nightmarish dates like everyone else.</TE>
<TE>   The smaller room is Reba's office. A sign taped to the door reads:
"Good morning. This is God. I will be handling all your problems
today. I will not be requiring your help."</TE>
<TE>   Reba's room is spare, bright and clean, with stuffed animals and
bowling trophies from high school on shelves, and religious relics,
such as a picture of Jesus, pasted on the walls. The usually
ebullient Lori does not talk much in here. This is Reba's place to be
alone, to think and pursue her interests.</TE>
<TE>   The sisters can create this separateness whenever one of them
needs it. On those occasions when they aren't getting along, "We
can't walk away," Lori said, "but we can ignore each other."</TE>
<TE>   Or, if Reba wants a private moment with a friend, Lori will tune
them out. It's the same when Reba is on stage. Of course Lori must
join her under the lights, but it is Reba who is center stage.</TE>
<TE>   When Lori goes on a date, as she did earlier this year in a
rendezvous filmed by "The Jerry Springer Show," it is Reba's turn to
fade away as much as possible.</TE>
<TE>   The show's cameras followed as Lori and her date went bowling and
to dinner. When the two met up in the studio, Lori was the recipient
of a long smooch.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not anything special," Lori said, again and again. "I am
just a normal, average American."</TE>
<TE>   Wheeling Reba out of her office and back into Lori's space, Lori's
voice becomes louder, her gestures more pronounced. She is proud of
their home. From the cluttered shelves to the kitchen full of Lori's
treats and Reba's healthy snacks, it represents their hard-won
independence.</TE>
<TE>   On this topic, the smaller twin breaks her silence for a moment to
express admiration for her sister.</TE>
<TE>   "She could be taking her situation and getting help from people,
and she ain't doing that," Reba said. "She's doing everything
herself, and making it on her own."</TE>
<TE>   Again and again, Lori talks of her pride in her sister as well.</TE>
<TE>   Reba has performed in New York and Holland, and has recorded a
three-song CD. She does not have a record contract, but Lori is
hopeful.</TE>
<TE>   Lori has said she will not talk about her sister too much, but her
conversation keeps turning to Reba. "She has goals in her life," she
said. "The only goal I've had, and still hopefully have, is to get
married and have children.</TE>
<TE>   "I want so much to be a mother," she said. "I want to go through
the morning sickness, the everyday ups and downs."</TE>
<TE>   Lori knows her dream of children dims with each passing year.
She's had four boyfriends, but none of the relationships have lasted.</TE>
<TE>   "Meeting men is hard," she said. But not, she is quick to add,
because she is a conjoined twin.</TE>
<TE>   "It's got nothing to do with that," she said. "It's normally hard
to do."</TE>
<TE>   About this, Lori is philosophical. "If it's not meant to be, it's
not meant to be," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She is content with her mastery of the apartment and the
comfortable rhythms of her day.</TE>
<TE>   "Normal is whatever you make of it, but we're very happy," she
said. "It all comes down to compromise. If more people in life did
that, the world would be a better place."</TE>

<HD>Blunders Numerous Before 9/11</HD>
<DH>Intelligence: Lawmakers focus on information that agencies
failed to share on two hijackers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The CIA failed repeatedly before Sept. 11 to share key information
with the FBI about two Al Qaeda suspects who became hijackers in last
year's attacks, even after learning the men held U.S. visas, were in
the United States, and had links to the bombing of the destroyer
Cole, congressional investigators disclosed Friday.</LD>
<LD>   When the FBI finally did learn that the two suspects were in the
United States--just weeks before the attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon--top bureau officials in Washington rebuffed
a frantic call from an agent in New York for an all-out search for
the men.</LD>
<LD>   In a prescient e-mail Aug. 29, the unnamed agent warned FBI
headquarters that if the bureau didn't add more agents to the hunt
"someday someone will die and ... the public will not understand why
we were not more effective and throwing every resource we had" into
tracking down the suspects.</LD>
<TE>   One senator called the latest disclosures "unbelievable." They
capped a flurry of revelations this week that apparently persuaded
President Bush on Friday to reverse course and support the creation
of an independent commission to conduct a more thorough investigation
of intelligence and other breakdowns surrounding the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's report went well beyond what was already known about
missed signals on these two hijackers, And it pointed to additional
intelligence on their travels to the United States that should have
prompted the CIA to sound alarms.</TE>
<TE>   It provided new evidence of what lawmakers called the bureaucratic
barriers, short-sighted policies and repeated blunders at the CIA and
the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   "We have failure piled upon failure here," said Sen. Carl Levin
(D-Mich.), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. "This is
truly unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   Friday's hearing focused on what the CIA and other intelligence
agencies knew about two of the 19 hijackers: Khalid Almihdhar and
Nawaf Hazmi, Saudi Arabian citizens who with three others seized
control of American Airlines Flight 77 and crashed it into the
Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   The report and accompanying testimony indicate that the CIA had
significantly greater cause to be pursuing Almihdhar and Hazmi than
previously disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   "In short," the report concluded, "the CIA had obtained
information identifying two of the 19 hijackers ... as suspected
terrorists carrying visas for travel to the United States as long as
18 months" before placing them on watch lists.</TE>
<TE>   The report noted that CIA Director George J. Tenet acknowledged in
closed-door testimony June 18 that the agency "had made a mistake in
not watch-listing these two individuals" earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Placing the suspects on watch lists would have brought them to the
attention of domestic authorities. The CIA gathers intelligence
overseas, but the FBI is exclusively responsible for tracking
terrorist suspects in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   When the two suspects were finally placed on federal watch lists
on Aug. 23, 2001--thus coming to the attention of the FBI--bureau
officials fought about how aggressively to pursue the men.</TE>
<TE>   In testimony Friday, the FBI agent who wrote the e-mail expressed
deep frustration with the handling of his memo and bureau policies
that he said prevented him and other agents from helping hunt for
Almihdhar in the days leading up to the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The agent's name was not revealed, nor was that of a CIA
counterterrorism official who also testified. Both sat behind screens
in the Senate hearing room, shielding them from public view.
Lawmakers said their identities were protected because of the
sensitive nature of their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI agent said he had been investigating the Al Qaeda attack
on the Cole in Yemen in October 2000. Almihdhar met with a key
planner of that attack in Malaysia in January 2000, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Upon learning that Almihdhar was in the United States, the agent
said he urged superiors to allow criminal investigators in the New
York office to help find him. But FBI officials in Washington
refused, saying Almihdhar was not under criminal investigation, and
they cited a "wall" between criminal and intelligence matters.</TE>
<TE>   "Someday," the agent replied, "someone will die and--wall or
not--the public will not understand why we were not more effective
and throwing every resource we had at certain 'problems.' "</TE>
<TE>   The agent said he was very upset when he learned Sept. 11, 2001,
that Almihdhar had been one of the hijackers. When a supervisor told
him that the bureau "had done everything by the books," the agent
described "how ludicrous that sounded to me."</TE>
<TE>   An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment Friday about the matter,
saying the bureau would not discuss an ongoing congressional
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the most damaging details to surface Friday centered on
the CIA's handling of information it obtained about Almihdhar and
Hazmi but failed to disclose to the FBI or other authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the meeting in Malaysia, the report said, the CIA had
Almihdhar's full name and passport number, and knew that he held a
multiple-entry U.S. visa that would not expire until April 2000.</TE>
<TE>   In March of that year, the CIA learned that Hazmi already was in
the United States, having flown into Los Angeles International
Airport on Jan. 15.</TE>
<TE>   But the CIA "did not act on this information," the congressional
report says, even when the agency subsequently learned that Almihdhar
also had arrived in Los Angeles that day.</TE>
<TE>   The agency's failure to tell the FBI about the suspects' arrival
in the United States is "puzzling because it occurred shortly after
the peak of intelligence community alertness to possible
millennium-related terrorist attacks," the report says. Indeed, Hazmi
and Almihdhar arrived in Southern California just weeks after the
arrest of another Al Qaeda operative on the Canadian border who later
admitted he was plotting to bomb LAX.</TE>
<TE>   The two suspects made no apparent attempt to hide their presence
in the United States. They moved to San Diego, where they used their
true names on a rental agreement. Almihdhar even used his real name
to obtain a California Department of Motor Vehicles photo
identification card.</TE>
<TE>   On July 7, 2000, Hazmi applied to the Immigration and
Naturalization Service for an extension of his visa using the San
Diego address. He lived there until December, when he moved to Mesa,
Ariz., where he joined Hani Hanjour, believed to have been the one
who piloted the hijacked Flight 77.</TE>
<TE>   Almihdhar left the United States, flying to Frankfurt, Germany,
but returned to this country July 4, 2001, barely two months before
the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA's interest in the Malaysia meeting soared in early 2001,
when it learned that a key planner of the Cole attack the previous
fall had attended the gathering. For the first time, Almihdhar and
Hazmi were directly linked to a top Al Qaeda operative.</TE>
<TE>   But even though the FBI had launched a massive investigation of
the Cole attack, the CIA continued to withhold critical information,
investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   At meetings in May and June, FBI agents were shown CIA photos of
the Malaysia meeting. FBI officials later told investigators that
Almihdhar came up in discussions in those meetings but that the CIA
said nothing about his travels to the United States or why the agency
was tracking him, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   The intelligence official also said CIA officials may have been
reluctant to pass on certain information because they had been
advised by FBI officials in Washington "not to get into operational
details," as it might taint ongoing investigations.</TE>
<TE>   Eleanor Hill, staff director of the congressional probe, said CIA
officials offered a number of explanations for failing to recognize
and share important information about the two would-be hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, the CIA officer analyzing the Malaysia meeting was
assigned to another task and the matter was "dropped" for some time,
Hill said.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until the summer of 2001, amid a torrent of intelligence
traffic indicating an imminent threat from Al Qaeda, that the CIA
finally sounded an alarm about Hamzi and Almihdhar.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 23, the agency ordered the FBI, the State Department and
the Immigration and Naturalization Service to put the two on watch
lists. But by then, the men were in the United States, and the
attacks were just 19 days away.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives of victims of the attacks have attended the hearings,
and they reacted emotionally at times to the testimony.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a national disgrace," said Sally Regenhard, who said her
son was a firefighter who was killed at the World Trade Center. "I
don't want to hear the words 'lessons learned.' I want accountability
and responsibility."</TE>

<HD>Kentucky Governor Admits 'Inappropriate' Relationship</HD>
<DH>Politics: Woman accuses state's leader of sexual
harassment. He denies giving her political favors and then later
seeking regulatory revenge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After two days of denial and evasion, a highly emotional Kentucky
Gov. Paul E. Patton admitted Friday to an "inappropriate personal
relationship" with a businesswoman and donor who is suing him for
sexual harassment.</LD>
<LD>   But at a brief news conference at the Capitol in Frankfort, Patton
dismissed the woman's claim that he gave her business ventures
preferential treatment and then, after she broke off the
relationship, sabotaged them with unfair scrutiny.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not easy for me to discuss private failures in a public
forum, but I do so because I want to be honest with the people of
Kentucky and try to earn their trust and respect again," he said.</LD>
<TE>   "I have now apologized to the people of Kentucky and asked for
your forgiveness. I do believe that now I am on the right path."</TE>
<TE>   Patton earlier this week stood with his wife of 25 years, Judi,
and declared that he had not had an affair with 40-year-old Tina
Conner. He canceled his planned appearances Friday and scheduled the
briefing after a Kentucky newspaper reported that more than 440 calls
had been made from the governor's office to several of Conner's phone
numbers from late 1997 to early this summer.</TE>
<TE>   The 65-year-old Democrat acknowledged that his earlier statement
was not true. "I am also sorry that I initially denied the failure in
my personal life," he said. "My first response was to deny my
unfaithfulness to Judi."</TE>
<TE>   Patton was considering challenging Republican Sen. Jim Bunning, a
Hall of Famer and former major league baseball pitcher, in 2004,
according to political analysts. Although it is unclear whether the
scandal might influence his decision to run, it is almost certain
that if he does, he will have a more difficult time unseating an
incumbent who, just days ago, was viewed as particularly vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   "That was probably one of the best shots Democrats had of picking
up a Senate seat in 2004," said Charlie Cook, publisher of the
Washington, D.C.-based Cook Political Report.</TE>
<TE>   Conner, a longtime Democratic donor and the owner of a nursing
home and a construction company in rural western Kentucky, filed the
harassment suit Wednesday. It alleged that Patton had provided her
businesses with regulatory favors, which she did not specify, then
sought regulatory revenge after she ended a relationship that
included trysts in his Capitol office and in Lexington and Louisville
hotels.</TE>
<TE>   Patton, chairman of the National Governors Assn., appointed Conner
to two state boards: the Institute for Aging in 1996--before their
affair began--and the state Lottery Board in 2000. (He also appointed
her then-husband, Seth Conner, from whom she was divorced this
summer, to the Kentucky Agriculture Development Board.)</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Tina Conner served as a sort of liaison between the
governor's office and western Kentucky interests.</TE>
<TE>   Before Patton's news conference, representatives of the governor
said the phone calls, which were first reported by the Louisville
Courier-Journal, were run-of-the-mill political calls between Capitol
officials and a far-flung operative.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Friday, Conner's attorney agreed that some of the
calls were indeed political calls. Others were mutually acceptable
personal calls, said Fred Radolovich. But still others were calls
that Conner considered unwelcome after she ended the affair in 1999.
"We have this two-year stalking telephone stuff," Radolovich said.</TE>
<TE>   In her suit, Conner alleges that Patton fondled her at a 1997
political fund-raiser and invited her to join him in her office. She
did, she says, and a two-year affair ensued.</TE>
<TE>   When the relationship ended, Radolovich said, the calls did not.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of them may have been self-serving," Radolovich said, noting
that Conner did not hang up or refuse to take some of Patton's calls,
even after she had ended their affair. "You don't want your business
to go under."</TE>
<TE>   In October 2001, Conner finally convinced Patton that the
relationship was over, Radolovich said. Two months later, Conner
alleges in her suit, she became "the target of harassment,
retaliation and intimidation by the regulatory agencies of the
executive branch of state government, which [Patton] controlled."</TE>
<TE>   In December 2001, inspectors from the state Cabinet for Health
Services slapped Conner's Birchtree Healthcare nursing home with
$156,000 in fines and handed the owner a 163-page report listing
deficiencies that needed to be addressed. Just 10 months prior,
inspectors had found few problems at the same facility.</TE>
<TE>   At another inspection in April, the inspectors once again found
numerous problems at the 112-bed facility, prompting Medicare and
Medicaid to halt payments.</TE>
<TE>   The state moved 103 of the patients to other facilities, leaving
only nine, all of whom paid for their care with personal funds.
Earlier this month, Birchtree filed for bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   During the affair, Conner alleges, the state Transportation
Cabinet gave ST Construction, a company she owns with her former
husband, special status, making it easier for the firm to land state
roadwork contracts. The company has never received any such
contracts, according to the state; it also is on the verge of
financial collapse, according to Radolovich.</TE>
<TE>   Elected to the statehouse in 1995, Patton, a gray-haired policy
wonk, governed his conservative-leaning state like a conservative, at
one point lighting up a cigarette and declaring he would not support
then-President Clinton if the Food and Drug Administration acted to
regulate tobacco as a drug.</TE>
<TE>   He instituted sweeping reforms in the state's higher education
system, peeling 13 junior colleges away from the University of
Kentucky and pumping $300 million into the university in an effort to
make it one of the country's top research facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "That's been the high-water mark of his administration," said
Richard Wilson, interim director of the university's School of
Journalism and formerly a reporter in Louisville.</TE>
<TE>   In his second--and under state law, final--term, Patton moved
moderately to the left, helping finance an early childhood
development bill with tobacco lawsuit settlement funds and increasing
the tax on long-distance phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   With favorable poll numbers, Patton had given Senate Democrats
high hopes of taking the seat from Bunning.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats felt Bunning has not distinguished himself in
Washington, D.C., and they had begun to view the possible race as one
with good odds in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a highly competitive state," Cook said. "People thought he
had a pretty decent chance for taking Bunning out. Now.... "</TE>

<HD>Pilot Held as Terrorism Plot Suspect</HD>
<DH>Probe: The man is one of several Sudanese taken into
custody. In Buffalo, six Americans accused of belonging to a 'sleeper
cell' remain jailed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. officials said Friday that they have detained a former Sudanese
air force pilot on suspicion of planning a terrorist attack, while a
judge in upstate New York said six U.S. citizens of Yemeni descent
must remain in custody for at least two more weeks for allegedly
being members of an Al Qaeda "sleeper cell."</LD>
<LD>   The pilot was one of several Sudanese men who have been taken into
custody in recent days after raising the suspicions of U.S.
intelligence and law enforcement officials, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   "They exhibited some suspicious behavior that led us to take them
into custody and question them as to whether there are any malicious
intentions here," said a U.S. official familiar with the case. "There
are grounds to have them in custody due to immigration violations as
well."</LD>
<TE>   Authorities released few details of the case, except to say that
the men are in the custody of U.S. law enforcement officials and
being questioned about potential ties to Al Qaeda and
as-yet-unidentified terrorist plots.</TE>
<TE>   One U.S. official said authorities are concerned that the men,
particularly the former Sudanese pilot, might have been planning to
hijack an airliner and fly it into the White House or another
high-profile target. But that official and other intelligence sources
cautioned that they have no definitive information to indicate that
such a plot was underway. "He had possibly shown interest in aviation
here in the U.S.," said the U.S. official.</TE>
<TE>   A second official, who works for a U.S. intelligence agency, said
authorities are still unclear about what the men might have been
doing and why they were in the United States. "We are trying to
determine all of that now," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a federal judge in Buffalo, N.Y., wrapped up the third
and final day of a detention hearing for six men who have been
charged with belonging to an Al Qaeda sleeper cell operating out of
the nearby town of Lackawanna.</TE>
<TE>   The case has attracted national attention since the men were
arrested eight days ago because it is the first time the Justice
Department has formally charged a group of U.S. citizens living on
U.S. soil with belonging to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the men have admitted attending the Al-Farooq training
camp in Afghanistan in the spring of 2001, according to affidavits
and court testimony this week. But their lawyers on Friday insisted
that the men were not planning any terrorist activities and should be
released on bail pending trial. "Each of our clients deny he was ever
a member of Al Qaeda, is now a member of Al Qaeda or ever intends to
become a member of Al Qaeda," said defense attorney James Harrington,
who represents defendant Sahim Alwan.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyer Joseph LaTona, who represents defendant Faysal
Galab, said the government was being hypocritical by admitting in
court Friday "that none of these individuals are members of Al Qaeda"
while charging them with crimes that could bring each a maximum
sentence of 15 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the defense position that our clients are not a danger to
the community or a risk of flight, and that the court can fashion
some condition that would allow their release on bail" while they
await trial, LaTona said. He offered to have his client wear an ankle
bracelet and even submit to surveillance cameras in his house to show
that he intends to stay in the hardscrabble steel town and face the
charges filed against him.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors said the six men must stay in jail to ensure
public safety.</TE>
<TE>   "The government and the American public just can't afford to let
crime on the scale of Al Qaeda ever happen again," Assistant U.S.
Atty. William Hochul said, referring to the Sept. 11 attacks, which
the United States blames on Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Magistrate H. Kenneth Schroeder sided with prosecutors,
saying he would study the testimony given during the three days of
hearings, allow both sides to file additional written motions and
then rule by Oct. 3. Until then, Schroeder told a packed courtroom,
the men must remain in custody because of the government's concern
that they are a threat to the community and at risk of fleeing.</TE>
<TE>   "I will attempt to balance all of the rights--the rights of the
community to be safe and the rights of the defendants who are
presumed to be innocent," Schroeder said.</TE>
<TE>   The six men--Galab, 26; Alwan, 29; Mukhtar al-Bakri, 22; Yasein
Taher, 24; Yahya Goba, 25; and Shafal Mosed, 24--have been charged
with providing "material support and resources" to Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Two other men from Lackawanna, identified as Kamal Derwish and
Jaber Elbaneh, are also wanted by federal authorities and are
believed to be in Yemen. Authorities have said they believe that
Derwish was the group's leader and that he encouraged the men to
travel to Afghanistan for training.</TE>
<TE>   Once there, the men allegedly learned how to fire automatic
weapons and attended a speech by Bin Laden, who urged attendees at
the Al-Farooq training camp to join him in his jihad, or holy war,
against the United States and its allies.</TE>
<TE>   Alwan testified Thursday that although he attended the camp, he
left after just 10 days "after realizing the crazy, radical
mentality" of people there.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials have said that merely attending the Al Qaeda
camp is enough to violate federal laws relating to providing material
support and resources to known terrorist organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyer LaTona disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "The facts alleged in the complaint ... do not constitute a
violation of this statute as it was intended, as it was enacted, and
as it has been interpreted," LaTona said outside court Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Mere attendance at the camp does not constitute material support
for Al Qaeda, LaTona said in court Thursday. "There's a gaping hole
in their proffer concerning any acts either of any commission of any
violence or even acts in preparation of any act of violence from June
2001 up until the time they were arrested," LaTona said.</TE>

<HD>Army Delays Burning Weapons, Citing Environmental Concerns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ANNISTON, Ala.</DL>
<LD>The Army has postponed plans to begin burning Cold War-era chemical
weapons at its new incinerator next month, citing new objections from
state environmental officials.</LD>
<LD>   The Army's spokesman for the project, Mike Abrams, said burning
would likely begin after Jan. 1.</LD>
<LD>   The Army had planned to begin destroying 2,254 tons of deadly Cold
War-era weapons at the Anniston Army Depot in late October.</LD>
<TE>   But the state Department of Environmental Management asked for a
delay Sept. 12, complaining that Army laboratory burn tests were not
done according to procedures approved by the agency.</TE>
<TE>   Abrams said the tests will be redone to meet state guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement Friday came hours after the Birmingham News
reported that Army officials exchanged e-mails outlining a plan to
deflect criticism of the incinerator by embarrassing local officials
over their stand on emergency response training.</TE>
<TE>   But Abrams said the newspaper's report did not influence the
timing of the announcement.</TE>

<HD>Secret Meetings About Waste Site Are Alleged</HD>
<DH>Nevada: State attorney general says public is being
excluded from Yucca Mountain plans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Nevada Atty. Gen. Frankie Sue Del Papa is accusing two federal
agencies of holding secret meetings about building the nation's
nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.</LD>
<LD>   Del Papa complained in letters to U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer
Abraham and Richard A. Meserve, chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, of what she called "a growing and apparently unlawful
trend" to exclude the public from decisions about the Yucca Mountain
project.</LD>
<LD>   "The state of Nevada and the public are entitled to notice and the
opportunity to participate at every level of decisions made about the
Yucca project," Del Papa said Friday.</LD>
<TE>   She stopped short of accusing the department and the NRC of
breaking the law or violating federal rules. The Energy Department
would operate the high-level nuclear waste repository, 90 miles
northwest of Las Vegas. The NRC would license it.</TE>
<TE>   But Del Papa pointed to comments by Energy Department officials at
a Sept. 10 meeting in Las Vegas about designs having been presented
to the NRC and about other meetings planned between Energy and NRC
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Margaret Chu, director of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste
Management, also submitted a document to board members stating that
the Energy Department had made commitments to the NRC about five
elements of the Yucca Mountain plan, Del Papa said.</TE>
<TE>   "Why was Nevada not given notice of such meetings or
interactions?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   An Energy Department spokesman said his agency has received Del
Papa's letter and was reviewing it, but he declined to discuss
specifics.</TE>
<TE>   "The DOE has fully complied with the relevant laws, rules and
regulations and we will continue to do so," spokesman Joe Davis said.</TE>

<HD>Giguere Feeling Secure in Net</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster; Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jean-Sebastien Giguere, for the first time in his brief career, knows
he will be the No. 1 goalie. He came to the Mighty Ducks' camp secure
in that knowledge.</LD>
<LD>   Any worries that he would either crumble under the pressure or get
complacent were quickly doused Friday. Giguere stopped 13 of 14 shots
in playing half of the Mighty Ducks' 1-1 tie with the Minnesota Wild
at the Arrowhead Pond. He was brilliant in keeping the game scoreless
early in the first period, making six point-blank saves in the first
10 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   "It is a little different for me this season," said Giguere, who
split time with Steve Shields last season. "But my job is the same. I
stop the puck. If you put too much pressure on yourself being the No.
1 guy, you're just going to stress yourself out."</LD>
<TE>   Last season, Giguere was fifth in goals-against average (2.13) and
tied for fifth in save percentage (.920). His play made Shields
expendable and he was traded to Boston. Giguere, barring injury, will
be expected to play 60-65 games this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The protective net behind each goal was not in use for Friday's
game because it needed to be refitted. Duck officials received NHL
permission to play without the nets, which are expected to be in
place next Friday for a game against San Jose.... The Ducks play at
Phoenix tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Foster</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Aaron Miller, one of four Kings eligible for
unrestricted free agency next summer, has been approached by the club
about a contract extension.</TE>
<TE>   Is he interested?</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely," he said. "I love playing here, and if they want to
talk, I'll certainly listen. But I don't want that to affect
anything. I don't want it to affect my play. I don't want to screw up
anything with the team.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything will take care of itself. Hopefully, we get something
done. But if we don't, that's fine too, and I'll move on. Whatever
happens happens."</TE>
<TE>   Miller, 31, is due $1.7 million this season as part of a two-year,
$3.3-million contract awarded by an arbitrator in August 2001. Two
months ago, former King defenseman Philippe Boucher signed a
four-year, $9.3-million free-agent deal with the Dallas Stars, and
last week defenseman Mattias Norstrom signed a four-year,
$14.5-million contract to remain with the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Goaltender Felix Potvin and forwards Bryan Smolinski and Craig
Johnson also are eligible for unrestricted free agency next summer.</TE>

featured Barretts Debutante will be running for the richest purse of
their careers, because this $100,000 race is restricted to distaffers
who have passed through the sales ring here.</LD>
<LD>   The most accomplished member of the cast would be the Indian
Charlie offspring Ionia, who scored a front-running 44-1 upset in her
Aug. 4 debut at Del Mar for trainer Chris Paasch. In her only other
race, she tired after battling on some quick fractions from the rail
in the Grade I Del Mar Debutante.</LD>
<LD>   There is no runner near the likes of Miss Houdini or Santa
Catarina this time, which means Ionia should pose an elusive target
with veteran G.F. Almeida at the controls.</LD>
<TE>   If she should fail to make the tight turns or falter when it
counts, there are any number of interesting possibilities to pick up
this prize. Last Kiss goes for sharp trainer Bill Spawr and will have
the services of Tyler Baze, who is the early leader in the jockey
race. After having trouble at the break in her debut last month, Last
Kiss had no such problems out of the gate in her last and lost a hard
battle with Sky's Snow, who is also in this race.</TE>
<TE>   The latter is conditioned by all-time Fairplex leading trainer Mel
Stute, and this homebred turned things around in that aforementioned
Aug. 30 race at Del Mar. That victory, plus the fact that she has
since turned in a best-of-the-morning workout over this tricky
course, is likely to get her lots of betting attention.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. More Candy. 2. One Fast Cartel. 3. Bearly Irish. 4.
Gaslamp Girl. 5. Cat On Guard. 6. Barron H. 7. Time To Strike. 8.
Miss Boomtown. 9. Immense Variety. 10. La Bandera. 11. Ionia. 12.
Mystic Too.</TE>

<HD>Plenty on the Line in Galaxy Finale</HD>

<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's no question that the Galaxy understands what's at stake when
it takes on San Jose tonight in a season-ending, Western
Conference-deciding match against its Bay Area rival.</LD>
<LD>   If the Galaxy defeats or ties the defending Major League Soccer
champion Earthquakes, it will win its fifth division title in the
league's seven-year history, clinch the No. 1 seeding top seed for
the playoffs and have home-field advantage throughout.</LD>
<LD>   But if the Galaxy loses at intimate Spartan Stadium, where the
Earthquakes boast a league-best home record of 12-0-1, Los Angeles
falls to the No. 3 seed, with the prospect of losing home-field
advantage in the second round to a team with three fewer victories.
The Eastern Conference champions automatically get a top-two seeding.</LD>
<TE>   "We've fought long and hard to try to get back into a position
where we could make this play," Galaxy captain Cobi Jones said. "Now
that we have this chance, we want to be strong in this match and have
all the pluses going into the playoffs and into the final.</TE>
<TE>   "The team's pretty confident right now but I think we're still at
a point where we can still play better than we have. In the playoffs,
we need to continue to be in an area where we're improving more and
more with each game."</TE>
<TE>   After trailing the Earthquakes by as many as 11 points this
season, the Galaxy has turned it on of late, winning five of its last
six league games and going unbeaten in its last 10 home games to pass
San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   "You can call it peaking but I call it a little more believing in
themselves," Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid said. "I think the team right
now is really believing in their ability to win games, even when
they're not on their best game, that they can still find a way to get
a result.</TE>
<TE>   "There's just a lot of faith and confidence in themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Especially since the Galaxy beat San Jose last Saturday, 1-0, on
an injury-time goal by Carlos Ruiz, a victory that moved the Galaxy
three points ahead of the Earthquakes in the standings. But because
of the goal differential tiebreaker, San Jose will get the No. 1 seed
if the Earthquakes beat the Galaxy tonight and finish with the same
record.</TE>
<TE>   Schmid expects a face-paced game on one of the smallest fields in
MLS and will not instruct his team to sit back and play it safe.</TE>
<TE>   "Because they're at home and have to win, we also know they've got
to come at us, so hopefully that will open up some spaces for us to
counterattack," Schmid said."You know that San Jose has to come at
you, so you're going to make sure that you get behind the ball and
you defend well. You're going to leave a couple of guys high so that
you can play balls into space for them and give them the opportunity
to counterattack and take advantage of that."</TE>
<TE>   San Jose is missing two key players, Richard Mulrooney to a
season-ending broken ankle and Jimmy Conrad to caution points
accumulation. The Galaxy may be without Peter Vagenas, who is nursing
a strained right hamstring.</TE>

<TE>   Update--Carlos Ruiz is taking the high road when questions arise
regarding his desire to win the MLS scoring title. "Winning the
individual award would be nice, but it's not the most important
thing," said Ruiz, who, with 47 points is two behind New England's
Taylor Twellman. "The most important thing is winning the team
championship." Coach Sigi Schmid is already sure of another award for
his first-year Guatemalan striker. "The league MVP is Carlos," Schmid
said. "There's no question in my mind." Eight of Ruiz's
league-leading 23 goals are game winners.</TE>

<LD>Tracy Lin, the Southern Section girls' tennis singles champion from
Anaheim Canyon High, has decided not to play for her high school team
this season.</LD>
<LD>   Lin, a junior who defeated Villa Park's Lindsay Nelson for the
title last season, is enrolled at Canyon but has decided to focus on
classwork and her private practice sessions.</LD>
<LD>   "I just wanted to concentrate on other things and have more time
to work on my game," said Lin, who is ranked No. 38 nationally and
No. 6 in Southern California in the U.S. Tennis Assn. standings.</LD>
<TE>   "I won the title last year and that's really all there is to
accomplish in high school tennis."</TE>

<TE>   Five of the top seven teams in The Times' girls' golf rankings
will play Monday in the third annual Alhambra Keppel tournament at
Alhambra Golf Course.</TE>
<TE>   Second-ranked Palm Desert, No. 3 Rolling Hills Estates Peninsula,
No. 5 Anaheim Esperanza, No. 6 Fullerton Rosary and No. 7 South
Torrance highlight the 20-team field.</TE>
<TE>   Team scores will be calculated using the best three out of four
scores.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Amy Abts has taken over as coach for the Santa Margarita girls'
golf team. She replaces Jim Neilsen, who will continue to coach a
lower-level girls' team and the varsity boys' team in the spring.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Margarita has qualified for the Southern Section finals in
two of the last three years and is expected to contend for the Serra
League title this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The rules on when girls' golf matches become official have stirred
confusion, most specifically the rule on whether a nine-hole match is
considered official.</TE>
<TE>   Southern Section Commissioner Jim Staunton said coaches must
predetermine the number of holes in a match and when that number of
holes has been completed, then the match becomes official.</TE>
<TE>   Often, 18-hole matches take place over two days, with nine holes
one day and nine another. Only the 18-hole scores count as an
official match in those cases, Staunton said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you declare a match as nine holes, then it's official after
that," Staunton said. "But you can't go tag on another nine later."</TE>
<TE>   The section limits teams to 18 varsity matches and stipulates that
a match consists of 18 holes.</TE>
<TE>   If coaches agree that a match will be nine holes, however, it
counts against the limit.</TE>

<TE>   John Hawks, boys' volleyball coach at Santa Margarita, has been

<LD>Riverside North and Fontana Kaiser played a game so close Friday
night at Riverside College that even when time had expired, a winner
hadn't been decided.</LD>
<LD>   A defensive pass interference penalty by Kaiser on the final play
of the game gave North, No. 9 in The Times' rankings, one last shot,
but Kaiser defensive back Marcus McCliman intercepted the desperation
pass and preserved a 24-21 nonleague victory.</LD>
<LD>   The lead changed hands three times in the final quarter, with
Kaiser (1-0-1) taking it for good on a two-yard touchdown run by
Allen Wade with 55 seconds remaining.</LD>
<TE>   It was the second consecutive game that came down to the final
minute for Kaiser, which forged a 29-29 tie with Rancho Cucamonga
last week by scoring and making a two-point conversion with 47
seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always in doubt," Kaiser Coach Dick Bruick said. "But we
want to be able to thrive under pressure."</TE>
<TE>   Wade, who rushed 17 times for 90 yards and two touchdowns, capped
a 77-yard final drive that featured quarterback Steve Sturdivant and
Antoine Cadon connecting on a nine-yard completion on fourth and
seven, followed by a 37-yard completion that set up the winning
score.</TE>
<TE>   North (1-1) took a 21-17 lead when Josh Barnett scored from a yard
out with 5:22 left. The score was set up by a 42-yard pass play from
Dion Morton to his twin brother, Damon.</TE>
<TE>   Leading, 14-7, late in the first half, Kaiser tried a long pass on
the final play of the half, but Damon Morton intercepted it and
returned it 70 yards for a 14-14 halftime tie. Dion Morton completed
16 of 26 passes for 183 yards with two interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Yoon</TE>
<TE>   Sherman Oaks Notre Dame 35, Westlake Village Westlake 21--The
Knights chalked up their second consecutive upset, turning an
unstoppable second-half ground game into a nonleague victory at
Westlake.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame (2-0), led by Collin Morgan and Brandon Clayton, rushed
for 247 yards, 221 in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan had 113 yards in 15 carries and Clayton had 88 yards in 10
carries, including touchdown runs of 15 and 43 yards in the second
half.</TE>
<TE>   Westlake quarterback Erik Vose completed 11 of 27 passes for one
touchdown with two interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Running Back Merrill Mullary had 46 yards and a touchdown in 18
carries for Westlake (1-1), which had 164 yards on offense.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bresnahan</TE>
<TE>   Alta Loma 31, Fontana Miller 7--Senior running back Greg Holt
gained 177 yards in 38 carries and scored on runs of one and three
yards to lead the Braves in a nonleague game at Chaffey College.</TE>
<TE>   Alta Loma (2-0) gained 196 of its 272 yards on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Weddle and Sione Toki each also had two-yard touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Alta Loma, ranked No. 24, also controlled the game on defense,
scoring its first two touchdowns after Weddle intercepted a pass and
recovered a fumble on consecutive series.</TE>
<TE>   Kyle Jacobo completed seven of 21 passes for 91 yards but threw
four interceptions for Miller (1-1), two of them to J.D. Moore.
Jacobo also rushed 17 times for 99 yards, scoring the Rebels' only
touchdown on a 23-yard scramble with 45 seconds left in the first
quarter to make the score 14-7.</TE>
<TE>   Lauren Peterson</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos 56, Brea Olinda 10--The Griffins were unable to end
Newhall Hart's unbeaten streak at 23 games last week but had no
problem stopping the 14-game winning streak of Brea Olinda, the
defending Division IX champion, at Brea Olinda High.</TE>
<TE>   Fifth-ranked Los Alamitos (1-0-1) scored on its first three
possessions and quarterback Jeff Kline completed 19 of 23 passes for
227 yards, including scoring strikes of 53 and 28 yards to Jeremy
Childs and four yards to Brandley Mandas,</TE>
<TE>   Childs, who had 10 receptions for 185 yards, also caught a 52-yard
touchdown pass from Justin Elway, who completed five of seven passes
for 131 yards as Los Alamitos rolled up 507 yards of offense.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Tripp caught 10 passes for 75 yards and also threw a
touchdown pass to Rasheed Prescott.</TE>
<TE>   Brea (1-1) trailed, 21-3, after the first quarter, but scored on
John Pohlen's five-yard pass to Evan Moore with 1 minute 23 seconds
remaining, only to see Kline throw his third touchdown pass with
eight seconds left for a 28-10 advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Henderson</TE>
<TE>   Santa Margarita 38, Redlands 14--Running back Ashton White gave
his coaches and fans a scare when it appeared he had seriously
re-injured his right knee, but he soon returned to give No. 9
Redlands a headache.</TE>
<TE>   White, who hurt the knee during the off-season, hobbled off the
field early in the second quarter of seventh-ranked Santa Margarita's
victory at Saddleback College after a vicious hit by linebacker Ca
Shun Robinson.</TE>
<TE>   But after a little ice and rest at halftime, White came back with
a vengeance, carrying 12 times for 68 yards in a 72-yard drive that
he punctuated with a seven-yard run.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Case Colaw, who completed all seven of his passes for
90 yards, threw a four-yard touchdown pass to Frank Guzman on the
next play.</TE>
<TE>   White, who has scored in 13 consecutive games, finished with 181
yards and a touchdown in 29 carries. Fullback Chase McWhorter scored
two touchdowns and gained 110 yards in 14 carries for Santa Margarita
(2-0).</TE>
<TE>   Running back Zach James led Redlands (1-1) with 136 yards and two
touchdowns in 20 carries.</TE>
<TE>   John Weyler</TE>
<TE>   Monrovia 52, West Covina 29--Kenny Parry completed six of 13
passes for 214 yards and four touchdowns, and the Wildcats scored 21
third-quarter points in a nonleague game at Monrovia High.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Guerrero scored on a one-yard run with 7:31 left in the
third quarter to pull West Covina (1-1) to within 31-21, but the
Bulldogs gave up two touchdowns in the last 1:41 of the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Gabriel carried 12 times for 93 yards and a touchdown and
also returned an interception 17 yards for a score near the end of
the third quarter, giving Monrovia (2-0) its biggest lead at 45-21.</TE>

<HD>Rumsfeld to Outline Plan for NATO Force</HD>
<DH>Military: Troops could mobilize quickly to reach hot spots
and handle major operations, even full-fledged war.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld will spell out plans Tuesday for
a long-discussed NATO "rapid reaction" military force capable of
reaching global hot spots in as little as a week, a senior defense
official said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The force's missions would range from rescuing civilians and
pursuing the anti-terrorism campaign to full-scale war. Rumsfeld
plans to deliver the proposal at a meeting of North Atlantic Treaty
Organization defense ministers in Warsaw.</LD>
<LD>   Because the force, if approved, could take up to two years to
create, it is not expected to be involved in any attack on Iraq, the
senior defense official said on condition of anonymity. But it could
take on battlegrounds of similar size, the official said.</LD>
<TE>   And the force would give NATO the capability to transform the
organization from a bit player to a major power in the Bush
administration's ongoing war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to take years, at least, to try to develop these
capabilities," the official said. But he said the force would have
"the ability to contribute to high-intensity conflicts," including
ones similar to the 1999 war over Yugoslavia's Kosovo province.</TE>
<TE>   The plan follows a NATO decision in May, triggered by the Sept. 11
attacks, to pursue the creation of a force that could take on rapidly
emerging threats by terrorists and so-called rogue nations, and be
ready to act in seven to 30 days. For example, the force could
quickly join U.S. troops in an Afghanistan-style conflict.</TE>
<TE>   If the NATO ministers agree, the proposal could be on the agenda
at a November summit of alliance leaders in Prague, the Czech
capital.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan, a detachment of about 5,000 troops would be able
to deploy immediately, with other troops at a lower state of
readiness bringing the corps to an estimated 20,000 members. One
brigade, which would rotate periodically, would be on call at all
times.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there is no question that 9/11 and the need for NATO to
think about problems out of its traditional area of operations is one
of the things that sparked this," the Pentagon official said.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld is likely to take the opportunity to press the
administration's campaign for a "regime change" in Iraq, as defense
ministers consider their nations' roles, if any, in such a conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "There's probably going to be general discussion about Iraq as
well as the intelligence situation" in the region, the senior defense
official said.</TE>
<TE>   The makeup of the fast-reaction force would be determined later
but would be expected to include North American as well as European
forces, perhaps with some countries specializing in specific military
capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   The force would be expected to also deploy outside NATO's usual
areas of operations on the two continents.</TE>
<TE>   Creating such a force would require NATO nations to move funding
from other projects to supply secure communications for wartime, gear
to protect troops from chemical and biological agents, and planes and
tankers to ferry troops and equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Defense officials said the proposed NATO force would be separate
and complementary to a more heavily equipped group being developed by
the European Union, comprising as many as 60,000 troops, designed to
deploy in 90 days.</TE>

<HD>Aspirin, Ibuprofen Warnings Advised</HD>
<DH>Health: Consumers need to be told the painkillers can cause
internal bleeding and kidney damage, a panel tells the FDA.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY TRICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Consumers should be warned that medications containing aspirin and
ibuprofen can cause internal bleeding and kidney damage, a government
advisory committee decided Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The panel of experts--made up of doctors and scientists--in the
second of two days of reviewing the side effects of the country's
most popular over-the-counter painkillers, found that consumers had
become so accustomed to taking aspirin and ibuprofen--sometimes in
larger doses than intended by manufacturers--that they had lost sight
of the risks.</LD>
<LD>   Without dissent, the 25-member commission sent its advice to the
Food and Drug Administration. The FDA is not obliged to follow the
panel's advice, but usually does.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday the group, formally known as the Nonprescription Drug
Advisory Committee, recommended that packages containing
acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, should warn of
serious and potentially fatal liver damage, particularly in case of
overdose.</TE>
<TE>   The experts turned Friday to the other two major painkillers,
ibuprofen, which is the medication in Advil and Motrin, and aspirin.
They are the most common "non-steroidal anti-inflam- matory drugs,"
or NSAIDs.</TE>
<TE>   "Aspirin is problematic," said Dr. Byron Cryer, an associate
professor of medicine and gastroenterologist at the University of
Texas Southwestern Medical School.</TE>
<TE>   "With low doses, the labeling is OK, but with higher doses ... is
a higher risk."</TE>
<TE>   For aspirin, the risk of internal bleeding in the stomach and the
rest of the gastrointestinal tract is somewhere from 1% to 3% for
those who take no more than the recommended dosage, but the risk
grows with the size of the dosage, prolonged use and a history of
ulcers and internal bleeding, the commission found.</TE>
<TE>   Advisory commission members expressed particular concerns about
doctors who recommended aspirin in large amounts to relieve arthritis
pain.</TE>
<TE>   They also worried about the use of several pain relievers in
tandem. Even though no single medication might be taken in amounts
that exceed recommended dosages, the combination could be dangerous,
the panel found.</TE>
<TE>   The commission discussed the problem of fitting all the desired
warning language in the limited space on small packages.</TE>
<TE>   "Packaging is a major impediment to safety," said Dr. John Cush,
chief of rheumatology and clinical immunology at Presbyterian
Hospital in Dallas. "Ask a lawyer: the longer [the text], the less
likely to read through it. The shorter, the more likely to try
struggling through it."</TE>
<TE>   The idea of copying the technology company was supported and
pushed by Dr. Eric Brass, chair of the department of medicine at
UCLA's medical center, who suggested following the lead of computers
with chips made by Intel that declare: "Pentium inside."</TE>
<TE>   Ibuprofen packages, he said, could feature the words, "NSAIDs
inside."</TE>

labels for aspirin and ibuprofen, Dr. Eric Brass, a member of the

<LD>The FBI said Friday that there was insufficient evidence to file
charges against the woman whose telephone calls to columnist Bob
Greene led him to contact agents months before he resigned from the
Chicago Tribune over a sexual encounter with a teenager.</LD>
<LD>   Greene contacted the FBI on June 20 and "expressed concerns over a
series of telephone calls that he had recently received, which he
felt were threatening in nature," the FBI said.</LD>
<LD>   Agents interviewed Greene and a woman who said she made the calls
but denied making threats.</LD>

related to an alleged "fight club" in a Mormon meeting house and was
ordered to serve 40 hours of community service.</LD>
<LD>   Chase Leavitt and scores of mostly high-school age youths sneaked
into a church gymnasium in December to stage the fights, charging
admission to spectators, authorities said. Police found a video
camera, which showed Leavitt and a younger boy wearing boxing gloves
and punching each other.</LD>

<LD>A judge annulled the marriage of a woman with Alzheimer's disease
after concluding that her husband, accused of spending nearly
$300,000 of her fortune in Las Vegas, was only after her money.</LD>
<LD>   Denver District Judge John Coughlin ruled that 79-year-old Glenna
Birmingham was not mentally competent when she wed 41-year-old Wando
Stevens in Las Vegas on New Year's Eve.</LD>
<LD>   He rejected claims by Stevens, who has a felony theft record, that
the two were in love.</LD>
<TE>   Relatives of Birmingham, a retired Denver pediatrician, said she
does not remember getting married to Stevens at the Candlelight
Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   "... She doesn't remember her marriage, she doesn't want to be

<HD>Push for Terror Panel Gets Boost</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: White House changes tack, drops opposition to
forming commission to probe intelligence failures leading up to 9/11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a surprising turnabout, the Bush administration Friday dropped its
opposition to the establishment of an independent commission to
investigate the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, removing a major
impediment to its creation.</LD>
<LD>   The administration's announcement came after three days of
congressional hearings that spotlighted intelligence lapses leading
up to last year's attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</LD>
<LD>   While the White House announcement was a significant development
in the effort to establish an independent commission--similar to the
one established after the attack on Pearl Harbor that brought the
U.S. into World War II--details of the panel's makeup and its scope
must be worked out.</LD>
<TE>   The Senate is expected to vote for the independent review early
next week as part of its consideration of legislation creating a
Department of Homeland Security.</TE>
<TE>   The House in July voted to create a National Commission on
Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Despite this congressional support, the proposal appeared to be
headed nowhere because of the administration's opposition.</TE>
<TE>   With House and Senate intelligence committees conducting a probe
of lapses by intelligence agencies, the administration considered an
independent commission unnecessary.</TE>
<TE>   The White House also was concerned that another inquiry could
distract intelligence officials working to detect terrorist threats.</TE>
<TE>   But Friday, the administration expressed its "strong support" for
an independent commission, saying it would build upon the work of the
congressional investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that the work of the intelligence committees is nearing its
end, we must take the appropriate next steps," Nicholas E. Calio, the
White House's chief congressional lobbyist, said in a letter to
congressional leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "Although the intelligence committees' joint inquiry focused
extensively on intelligence matters, it did not address the panoply
of other important and related issues as they may relate to Sept. 11,
such as coordination between the intelligence community and
non-national security agencies, border security and visa issues,
commercial aviation and the role of state and local governments."</TE>
<TE>   Political analysts attributed the administration's change of
attitude in part to this week's emotional testimony in support of an
independent review by the families of victims of last year's attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "When the victims' families say they want a commission, it's hard
to say no," said John J. Pitney Jr., a government professor at
Claremont McKenna College.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a matter of both emotion and reason. The emotion lies in the
image of grieving relatives who want answers," Pitney added.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason lies in the sensible argument that Congress lacks the
time and resources to do the job properly."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), who with GOP Sen. John McCain
of Arizona is pushing for an independent commission, welcomed the
White House announcement. But he noted that the administration did
not commit to support a specific proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman and McCain's proposal calls for creating a 10-member
panel made up of "prominent U.S. citizens with national recognition
and backgrounds in government service, law enforcement, the armed
services, legal practice, public administration, intelligence
gathering, commerce, and foreign affairs."</TE>
<TE>   Appointments would be evenly divided between Democrats and

<HD>INS Settles Suit Alleging Bias at Its Miami Offices</HD>
<DH>Courts: Legal action also involved an agent who said he
faced retaliation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>The Immigration and Naturalization Service settled a lawsuit Friday
that alleged its Miami offices fostered anti-Cuban and anti-Latino
sentiments and retaliated against an agent who aired bias accusations
after the armed raid to seize Elian Gonzalez.</LD>
<LD>   The federal whistle-blower lawsuit, brought by INS agent Ricardo
Ramirez against the Justice Department, had been scheduled to go to
trial on Monday. Ramirez claimed he faced retaliation after going
public with allegations of bias at the INS.</LD>
<LD>   Most terms of the settlement are secret.</LD>
<TE>   Ramirez, a 17-year veteran of the agency, claimed he has been the
target of about 20 internal complaints since he spoke out after the
armed federal raid to seize Elian from the home of his Miami
relatives in April 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez claimed a picture of Elian bearing the words "Kick me" was
taped to a box, encouraging passers-by to vent their frustration with
the slow-moving tug of war between the boy's Miami relatives and his
father in Cuba. Elian was eventually returned to his father's
custody.</TE>
<TE>   INS agents also testified they saw cup holders bearing a
crossed-out image of a Cuban flag, "banana republic" banners and
swastikas on display at the Miami office.</TE>
<TE>   In a hearing in May, a federal judge said he was troubled by
"persuasive evidence" of anti-Cuban sentiment at the agency's local
office. But the judge dismissed the discrimination complaint, saying
he didn't have jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   Several agents who testified at an administrative hearing in April
differed on whether the sentiments were widespread, encouraged from
supervisors or simply tolerated.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez said Friday that he was pleased with the settlement. He
had asked for a transfer to Texas and the removal of items from his
personnel file that involved his accusations.</TE>

<HD>1996 Fund-Raising Scandals Bring Stiff Penalty</HD>
<DH>Politics: The FEC levies a record $719,000 in fines against
DNC and other groups for arranging illegal contributions from foreign
sources.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Federal Election Commission disclosed Friday that it has imposed
a record-setting $719,000 in fines against participants in the 1996
Democratic Party fund-raising scandals involving contributions from
China, Korea and other foreign sources.</LD>
<LD>   The FEC documents describe Democratic fund-raisers who set
specific prices for foreign nationals to make illegal campaign
contributions in return for meetings with then-President Clinton and
Vice President Al Gore. A Democratic finance vice chair, for example,
said organizers would have to contribute a total of $100,000 in
return for Gore's appearance at a Buddhist temple in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Those penalized included the Democratic National Committee, the
Clinton-Gore campaign, the Buddhist temple and nearly two dozen
people and corporations acting as conduits for illegal contributions.
All have agreed to pay, according to the documents.</LD>
<TE>   The total in fines would have been significantly higher except
that some of the corporations have folded and others were dummy
operations, with no assets, set up as conduits for money from China,
Venezuela, Canada and other countries. Foreign individuals and
organizations are barred from contributing to federal elections. In
some cases, foreigners who would have been subject to fines could not
be located and served with papers. In other cases, which sometimes
produced minor news coverage, the individuals pleaded guilty in
criminal cases and are bankrupt.</TE>
<TE>   The DNC was fined $115,000, the Clinton-Gore campaign $2,000, and
the Buddhist Progress Society $120,000. In the conciliation signed by
DNC lawyer Joseph Sandler, the party agreed to pay the fine and to
"disgorge [an additional] $128,000" to the U.S. Treasury,
representing illegal contributions that were not returned to donors.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate document, the FEC said it decided to drop cases
against contributors of more than $3 million in illegal DNC
contributions because the respondents are either "out of the country
and beyond our reach, or corporations that are defunct."</TE>
<TE>   In more than 400 pages of documents, the FEC detailed a variety of
illegal fund-raising schemes in the 1996 Clinton reelection group.</TE>
<TE>   In some respects, the 1996 fund-raising efforts by the Clinton
White House and the DNC were a Democratic counterpart to the
Republican Watergate scandals of 1972.</TE>
<TE>   Just as Watergate was followed by the campaign finance laws of
1974 and 1976, disclosures of the 1996 activities played a crucial
role in prompting Congress to enact the McCain-Feingold campaign
finance law this year.</TE>
<TE>   The FEC describes how John Huang, a DNC finance vice-chair in
1996, "set a goal of raising $7 million from the Asian American
community." This effort included the now-famous luncheon with Gore at
the Buddhist temple, and a "coffee" at the White House and a
"birthday dinner for President Clinton" at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel
in N.Y.</TE>

<HD>Miami Hires a Manager for Election</HD>
<DH>Voting: Hoping to avoid repeat of problems with Democratic
primary, county police director is put in charge of crisis control
for November.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>The county hired a crisis manager Friday to run its general election
in November to avoid a repeat of the botched Democratic gubernatorial
primary race.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor Alex Penelas said he hired Miami-Dade Police Department
Director Carlos Alvarez in response to a report released Friday by
the county inspector general that called plans to fix Miami-Dade
County's election system insufficient and untested.</LD>
<LD>   Alvarez has been given complete responsibility for the Nov. 5
election, including poll worker training, precinct management and
deciding whether to adopt other recommendations in Inspector General
Christopher Mazzella's report, Penelas said.</LD>
<TE>   A message seeking comment left for Alvarez late Friday at the
Police Department was not immediately returned.</TE>
<TE>   It took Florida a week to determine that Bill McBride defeated
former Atty. Gen. Janet Reno in the Sept. 10 primary, in part because
of problems Miami-Dade and Broward counties had opening and closing
polls and tallying votes. The problems have been blamed on a lack of
training, a lack of familiarity with new computerized equipment and
poor organization.</TE>
<TE>   Mazzella's report urged the county to prepare itself for election
problems by enlisting crisis managers already employed by the Police
Department and the emergency management office.</TE>
<TE>   Officials need to treat the election as a "crisis situation,"
Mazzella wrote. "Elections are like other major events. For instance,
we could not imagine the county hosting the Super Bowl unless it had
in place a crisis management plan."</TE>
<TE>   The report said Elections Systems &amp; Software, the company that
manufactured the new machines, "bears major responsibility" for the
primary election mistakes.</TE>

<HD>Suspect in Girl's Taped Beating to Surrender, Lawyer Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MISHAWAKA, Ind.</DL>
<LD>A woman wanted in connection with the videotaped beating of her
4-year-old daughter outside a department store will turn herself in
to authorities in Chicago, a lawyer said Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   Stephen Rosen, a Texas lawyer who said he represents Madelyne
Gorman Toogood, held a news conference in Chicago several hours after
he contacted police, who have been searching for Toogood and her
daughter.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a bad choice, and it was captured on Candid Camera," Rosen
said. "She's very remorseful. She regrets it."</LD>
<TE>   Police in Mishawaka, between South Bend and Elkhart about 90 miles
east of Chicago, said that they had been in contact with Rosen by
phone, but they had no specific information about when or where
Toogood might surrender.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities feared the girl, Martha Toogood, might have been
seriously injured when she was hit and shaken Sept. 13 outside a
department store in Mishawaka.</TE>
<TE>   Rosen said Toogood's extended family members and friends told him
the child was fine, but police said they wanted to get the girl
medical attention.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to get her to an emergency room and let them examine
her," Police Chief Anthony A. Hazen said hours before Rosen's news
conference. "That's our biggest concern right now."</TE>
<TE>   An arrest warrant issued Friday charged the mother with battery to
a child.</TE>
<TE>   The video showed a woman placing the girl onto the back seat of a
sport utility vehicle in the store's parking lot, then pummeling,
slapping and shaking her for several seconds.</TE>
<TE>   The episode happened after the woman left the store angry about
being refused a cash refund, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Toogood's sister, Margaret Daley, 31, who authorities say was with
her at the store, was arrested and charged with a misdemeanor count
of failure to report child abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors later added a charge of assisting a criminal.</TE>
<TE>   Police received more than 1,000 calls about the videotape, which
was first aired Wednesday night by local stations seeking the
identity of the woman and the girl.</TE>
<TE>   Security personnel from the Kohl's store notified police about the
incident, said Susan Henderson, a spokeswoman for the retail chain,
based in suburban Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Texas authorities said Toogood is wanted on unrelated warrants
there, including failure to pay a traffic ticket, and failure to
appear in court to face theft charges.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MONROE CITY, Ind.</DL>
<LD>Severe thunderstorms and tornadoes raked the Midwest on Friday,
injuring people at an Ohio festival and damaging dozens of homes in
Indiana.</LD>
<LD>   Lights set up for a festival in Crestline, Ohio, toppled in the
wind and fell on a crowd. Two people were in critical condition and
eight others went to hospitals.</LD>
<LD>   There were many reports of injuries in Indiana, but all of them
were minor, said Alden Taylor, a spokesman for the State Emergency
Management Agency.</LD>
<TE>   The storm dumped about 5 inches of rain in a nearly 100-mile
stretch from Vincennes to Indianapolis. The Indiana National Guard
planned to send two helicopters out this morning to survey the
damage.</TE>
<TE>   Several transmission towers were destroyed, and about 80,000
people were without power.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been several years since we have had widespread damage in
the state like this," Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   Areas of Ohio reported tree limbs, power lines and barns being
knocked down.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses reported seeing a tornado near Monroe City, about 100
miles southwest of Indianapolis, that damaged 12 to 15 homes and
destroyed some of them, said Steve Dillon, director of Knox County
emergency management.</TE>
<TE>   Weather forecasters issued several tornado warnings Friday,
including one in southwestern Pike County that Lori Dedrick heard
while she was shopping. She rushed to her parents' home to wait out
the storm in the basement with her parents.</TE>
<TE>   "Within five minutes, our ears started popping" because of the
tornado, Dedrick said.</TE>
<TE>   The storm tore off the deck of the house and a neighbor's roof,
Dedrick said.</TE>
<TE>   Ten to 12 houses were destroyed and an apartment complex was
damaged in Ellettsville, 50 miles south of Indianapolis, Taylor said.
Officials had reports that 15 trailer homes and a county garage were
destroyed in Posey County in southwestern Indiana, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Strong winds also destroyed homes and a church in Indianapolis,
tore off part of the roof of an Indianapolis YMCA and flipped at
least 40 cars in a mall parking lot in Greenwood, just south of the
capital.</TE>
<TE>   "It sucked all the pressure out of the building," said Brian
Daley, who was working out at the YMCA when the storm hit. "The doors
flew open. We had to fight our way back."</TE>

<HD>It's Like 'American Idol'--but for Oval Office</HD>
<DH>Media: Presidential hopefuls will vie for job in FX
reality series. U.S. public will pick winner.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If reality television has proved nothing else, it's that people want
to be on television, sometimes desperately, and that they have a
willing partner in television networks looking for low-cost ratings.</LD>
<LD>   Thus far, the nation has seen otherwise ordinary folks sing
off-key ("American Idol"), humiliate themselves in front of the
opposite sex ("Blind Date") and, of course, spend weeks not bathing
in foreign lands ("Survivor").</LD>
<LD>   Now, cable network FX plans to use the institution of the
presidency to lure more would-be fame seekers, in a reality program
whose 10-words-or-less pitch, producer R. J. Cutler told Daily
Variety on Friday, goes like this: "It's like a cross between 'The
War Room' and 'American Idol.' "</LD>
<TE>   Cutler (along with two others, including Jay Roach, who directed
the "Austin Powers" movies), has sold FX a series in which
prospective presidential candidates will be found, whittled down by
experts and through debates, and voted on by the American public in
the same way that "American Idol," which was a summertime ratings hit
for Fox, presented a fabricated-on-the-spot pop star.</TE>
<TE>   The show isn't expected to be broadcast until January 2004, the
start of the next presidential election year. Like those in real
life, anyone who wants to run for president on TV must be a
natural-born American citizen who has lived in the country for the
last seven years and must be at least 35 years old as of Jan. 20,
2005.</TE>
<TE>   "Ross Perot, Steve Forbes--these guys challenged the status quo,
but they had millions and millions of dollars behind them," said FX
President Kevin Reilly, striking a note of support for the common
man. He wondered aloud how Abraham Lincoln would have fared in
today's big-moneyed political arena. Perhaps there's another Lincoln
out there, watching cable in his log cabin.</TE>
<TE>   While acknowledging that the show sounds somewhat absurd, Reilly
said he hoped it would also illuminate the democratic process, even
produce a kind of "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" populist who will
affect real politics.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether potential contestants will be asked during the
screening process to explain how a bill becomes a law, Cutler, the
producer, said: "I'm sure at a point during the process they will
have to demonstrate their knowledge of American government." He
added, however, that "it will be up to viewers to decide" how
informed a president they want.</TE>
<TE>   Cutler was one of the producers of "The War Room," the 1993
documentary on Bill Clinton's first run for the White House--a
project that helped turn two animated politicos, George
Stephanopoulos and James Carville, into media celebrities of the
future.</TE>
<TE>   To qualify, Cutler said, hopefuls will have to round up 50
signatures supporting their candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   The series seeds, he said, were planted during the controversial
end to the 2000 presidential election, when the U.S. Supreme Court's
decision led to George W. Bush's victory in Florida vote.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that a lot of people feel that the two-party system that
we currently have is designed to reward part of its own machinery,"
Cutler said.</TE>
<TE>   Throwing a window onto the inequities of the political process,
however, doesn't sound like entertaining television. Thus, the added
fantasy of finding someone who dreams of becoming president.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's a really great show to do about this process for
a congressman or senator. I think it's a great idea. In the future, I
think that's something we should do," Cutler said.</TE>
<TE>   Informed Friday of the planned project, Democratic political
consultant Mark Mellman said: "Let's put it this way. Already, many
more people watch C. J. Cregg's press conferences [on the NBC drama
"The West Wing"] than watch any of [White House Press Secretary] Ari
Fleischer's press conferences. Sometimes the fake world is more
entertaining than the real world."</TE>
<TE>   However, he added, referring to "American Idol": "It's one thing
to find out there's a great singer that you missed. You're unlikely
to find a great president that you missed."</TE>

<LD>Their stories are the stuff of creepy movies and daytime TV: Hospital
patients resuscitated on the operating table speak of being drawn
toward a brilliant light, or looking down on their own bodies and the
doctors working feverishly to save their lives.</LD>
<LD>   What induces these brief, haunting images? A new study suggests
these "out of body" and "near death" experiences may be influenced by
a portion of the brain misfiring under stress.</LD>
<LD>   A paper, published in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature,
describes one patient's visions while being evaluated for epilepsy.</LD>
<TE>   Researchers point to a processing center in the brain known as the
angular gyrus, which is thought to play a key role in the way the
brain analyzes sensory data to give us a perception of our own
bodies. When it misfires, they speculate, the result can be visions
of floating outside of ourselves.</TE>

<LD>Astronomers have detected what could be a "missing link" in the
development of the universe: midsize black holes that are neither
supermassive nor as small as a single exploded star.</LD>
<LD>   The middling black holes were spotted using the Hubble Space
Telescope in two globular star clusters in Earth's celestial
neighborhood, astronomers said.</LD>
<LD>   While astronomers have known for years about vastly large black
holes and rather small ones, said Steinn Sigurdsson, who attended a
NASA news conference on the find as an independent commentator, "We
didn't know if we could get from one to the other or if they were
completely unrelated, and this seems to be the step that takes us
from one to the other."</LD>
<TE>   Black holes are unimaginably dense regions in space whose
gravitational pull allows nothing to escape. For that reason, black
holes are invisible but can be detected by the pattern of swirling
stars and gas around their edges.</TE>

<LD>A long-lost piece of an Apollo rocket has returned to Earth orbit
after decades of racing around the sun, the first time our planet has
captured an object from solar orbit, astronomers said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Earth's new satellite is most likely the third stage of a massive
Saturn V rocket that lifted Apollo 12 astronauts to the moon in
November 1969, according to astronomers at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   Last seen in an elongated 43-day orbit around Earth, the bus-sized
rocket stage escaped Earth orbit in March 1971, the laboratory said.</LD>
<TE>   Known now as J002E3 and first seen by an amateur astronomer Sept.
3, the rocket stage probably completed nine or 10 Earth orbits, then
swung far enough toward the sun to be pulled into a sun-centered
orbit, the JPL said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Scientists say they have created enough antihydrogen--a type of the
mirror-image antimatter that fictionally powers spaceships on "Star
Trek"--to test a widely held basic model of the universe.</LD>
<LD>   Although antihydrogen has been made before, the more than 50,000
atoms created at the CERN particle accelerator in Geneva are "by far
the most produced," said Jeffrey Hangst, a leader of the ATHENA
collaboration, one of two groups of physicists working on
antihydrogen at CERN.</LD>
<LD>   The quest to understand and manipulate antimatter is one of
science's most competitive pursuits.</LD>
<TE>   ATHENA researchers, whose work appeared in Thursday's issue of the
journal Nature, plan to make more antihydrogen to test the Standard
Model, equations that explain the nature of matter and energy. If the
antihydrogen doesn't behave the same as normal hydrogen, "the
textbooks would have to be rewritten," said Hangst, a physicist at
the University of Aarhus in Denmark.</TE>
<TE>   Antimatter is the mirror image of conventional matter with
opposite properties. Antimatter is destroyed whenever it collides
with matter, turning both into bursts of electromagnetic radiation.
Scientists believe this process was crucial to the creation of the
universe.</TE>

<HD>Hormone Eases Symptoms of MS</HD>
<DH>Study: Estriol, produced in pregnancy, lessened signs of
the disease in a handful of women, a UCLA team has found. Results are
preliminary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSIE MESTEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A hormone produced by the human placenta reduced the symptoms of
multiple sclerosis in a small test group of women, explaining the
oft-noted observation that women with this neurological disease
report fewer symptoms during pregnancy.</LD>
<LD>   The study, by researchers at UCLA's David Geffen School of
Medicine, found that women in early stages of multiple sclerosis
developed less inflammation in their brains and underwent encouraging
changes in their immune function when given the hormone estriol for
several months.</LD>
<LD>   While the finding is positive, the scientists caution that the
study is very preliminary, involving a handful of women and designed
mostly to check whether the treatment was safe.</LD>
<TE>   Multiple sclerosis is a disease in which the body's immune system
attacks the insulation of nerve fibers, causing symptoms such as
tingling and numbness, even blindness and paralysis. Typically
developing during early adulthood, MS affects an estimated 1 in
10,000 adults in the United States. Twice as many women as men are
afflicted with the condition.</TE>
<TE>   Current medications, such as interferon beta-1a and glatiramer
acetate, carry side effects such as flulike symptoms and depression
and must be injected, leading to scarring at the injection site.</TE>
<TE>   At one time, women with the disease were discouraged from having
babies because symptoms had been observed to worsen after their
pregnancies.</TE>
<TE>   But patients and doctors had also noticed that during the
pregnancy, symptoms noticeably improved. Scientists hypothesized that
one of the hormones of pregnancy was the cause--and that the
improvement was linked to immune system changes aimed at avoiding
rejection of the fetus.</TE>
<TE>   Estriol is produced by the placenta and is found in the human body
in large amounts during the second and third trimester of pregnancy.
When a group led by Dr. Rhonda Voskuhl, associate professor of
neurology at UCLA, tested estriol in a mouse model for multiple
sclerosis, they found that the animals' symptoms improved.</TE>
<TE>   That led Voskuhl's team to begin a human study, published today in
the journal Annals of Neurology.</TE>
<TE>   In the study, Voskuhl and colleagues enrolled 12 women suffering
from multiple sclerosis. Six of the women had a common, early version
of the illness known as relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, in
which symptoms come and go. Another six patients had more serious and
advanced illness.</TE>
<TE>   All women were given an oral dose of estriol equivalent to hormone
levels found during the sixth month of pregnancy.</TE>
<TE>   After six months of treatment, the patients with relapsing
remitting multiple sclerosis had fewer and smaller regions of
inflammation within their brains as revealed by magnetic resonance
imaging. The profile of immune chemicals in their blood, and their
immune reactions, improved. Their scores on certain mental tests also
improved. When the drug was withdrawn for several months, the
symptoms worsened--but improved again when the estriol was
reintroduced.</TE>
<TE>   Patients with the more serious and advanced form of the disease
(known as secondary progressive multiple sclerosis) showed no
improvement from estriol treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "This is extremely early data," cautioned Dr. Stephen Reingold,
vice president for research for the National Multiple Sclerosis
Society, which helped fund the work. "But it's a good study,
[Voskuhl's] a good investigator and she's proceeding in exactly the
right direction."</TE>
<TE>   Voskuhl and her colleagues are now planning a controlled trial at
10 U.S. sites involving about 70 women with multiple sclerosis. After
that, an even larger trial tracking the health of patients for
several years will be needed to see whether the drug is safe and
makes a significant difference in the course of disease.</TE>
<TE>   Voskuhl said it is possible estriol may help treat other immune
system diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or thyroiditis.</TE>
