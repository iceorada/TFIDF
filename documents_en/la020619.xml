<LD>It was a Monday night like any other in Beverly Hills. A glossy hotel
lobby overrun with the almost-famous crowd and the reporters and
photographers eager to help them to the top. On any other night,
Maurice White, his brother Verdine White, Philip Bailey and their
bandmates could have slipped through the masses unnoticed. As it was,
most people didn't recognize the guests of honor of the American
Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers' 15th Annual Rhythm &amp;
Soul Music Awards: Earth, Wind &amp; Fire.</LD>
<LD>   Once the word was out at the Beverly Hilton, however, the group
was swarmed. One TV reporter spent the first two minutes of his
interview lavishing them with praise. In the background, a record
company executive mimed the dance steps they made famous during their
spectacular stage shows. Another reporter cornered the band to detail
his own teenage years as a musician. "I survived the disco era
because of playing your songs," he said. (The music is a mightily
danceable fusion of jazz, soul, gospel, blues and rock.)</LD>
<TE>   ASCAP, a performing-rights organization that represents more than
135,000 composers, songwriters and music publishers, honored the band
with the Heritage Award to celebrate its lasting influence on music.
While the evening's honor was clearly meaningful to the band, it
comes after a 30-year career, 23 albums, 30 million album sales, six
Grammys and an induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   Maurice White said his band's music remains relevant because "it
starts from the heart and transfers to the listener's heart. It gets
your attention. The most important thing is the sincerity."</TE>
<TE>   As Earth, Wind &amp; Fire answered reporters' questions, the crowd
awaited the evening's other musical legend. "You guys know who Stevie
Wonder is, right?" an ASCAP executive asked his teenage niece and her
friend. (They did.)</TE>
<TE>   About an hour later, Wonder took the podium. His first words were
drowned out by the audience's roar of applause, moving Wonder to sing
a cappella a few bars of "I Wish." He spoke candidly of his exposure
to music as a child in Detroit. "I never imagined I'd be in this
business," he said. Then, Wonder recalled being inspired by an Earth,
Wind &amp; Fire song. "When I heard 'Shining Star,' I went right into the
studio to write 'I Wish,' " he said. Wonder called the band to the
stage to accept the award. "I know we've touched many lives," Maurice
White told the crowd. "You've touched our lives, too."</TE>
<TE>   In a Spy's World,</TE>
<TE>   Age Matters</TE>
<TE>   Producer Mace Neufeld, the man responsible for bringing the spy
novels of Tom Clancy to the big screen, was apprehensive about Ben
Affleck resuming the role made famous by Harrison Ford, 59. "My
initial response was, 'Wait a minute, he's 28 years old!' " said
Neufeld by phone on Monday. "My second response was, 'But that's also
a lot of our problems with the script.' "</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Neufeld had little more than the rights to make "The
Sum of All Fears." He had struggled nearly two years to develop a
story that everyone liked. Eventually, he lost Ford to "K-19: The
Widowmaker," due out in July, and director Phillip Noyce ("Clear and
Present Danger" and "Patriot Games") to another project. That's when
Affleck's people called.</TE>
<TE>   With Ford in the lead, the script was complicated by the
character's progression during the eight years since the last Jack
Ryan film, Neufeld said. However, with Affleck in the lead, Neufeld
could pretend the first two films never happened. "If we looked at
Affleck as a rookie CIA agent, then most of our script problems were
solved," the producer said. "Particularly if we gave him a mentor."
Neufeld chose Morgan Freeman for that role after meeting him at the
Flanders International Film Festival in Ghent, Belgium.</TE>
<TE>   The gamble with Affleck seems to have paid off. As of Sunday, the
film had earned $85 million in four weeks, tens of millions more than
1994's "Clear and Present Danger," Neufeld said. "It's kind of given
the franchise a shot in the arm."</TE>
<TE>   The success of "Changing Lanes" and "Sum" has reinvigorated
Affleck's career as a leading man, Neufeld said. "I think he's one of
our four or five major young leading stars today."</TE>
<TE>   Quote/Unquote</TE>
<TE>   "Most people in show business are mining the strangeness that's
inside of them," Tom Waits tells Entertainment Weekly's EW.com this
week.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried for a long time to be like everybody else....You know,
there's only seven haircuts available at the barbershop and a certain
limited supply of shoes.</TE>
<TE>   "But at some point, if you do have things about you that are
irreconcilable, you say to yourself, 'Maybe I can make some money out
of this.' You join the circus. That's what music is. So that's what I
did."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>For the last six months, Michelle has been living at Shelter First,
an old downtown L.A. hotel that once housed skid row transients. The
11-year-old shares a one-bedroom unit with her single mother and
three younger sisters at the 296-room hotel, which now provides
homeless families with emergency and transitional housing. The
facility may have changed, but not the neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   "She is surrounded by concrete and people who are transients.
There is no vision of a different world," said Charlene Gowers, the
executive director of Shelter First Inc., a nonprofit organization
that provides long-term transitional housing for the homeless. "To
send her somewhere where she can see trees and space and sky and have
counselors there to work toward goals with is magnificent, especially
when the risk is right outside the door. She doesn't even have to
take five steps."</LD>
<LD>   Michelle, who requested that her name be changed for this story,
will be part of the first group of children from the shelter to ever
attend summer camp. A $5,000 grant from the Los Angeles Times summer
camp campaign will cover the expenses for 33 children at Circle V
Ranch Camp in Santa Barbara. Most are excited about going away for a
week in August, but "they are a little scared because they are from
unstable backgrounds," said Gowers. "So anything out of the
day-to-day schedule is scary."</LD>
<TE>   She is counting on Michelle to be a leader. Michelle is "really
spunky, a live wire," but she wasn't always so outgoing, said Gowers.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother's drug-addiction problems resulted in the family losing
its South-Central Los Angeles home a year and a half ago. The four
girls and their mother, who is now drug-free, moved to a mission in
downtown Los Angeles, where they had to wake up every morning before
6 and pack up their things. They would wait at a park or walk around
until 4 p.m., when they were allowed back in for the night. Michelle
began to miss school, and because Michelle is the oldest, her mother
"depended on her to be responsible for her siblings," said Gower.</TE>
<TE>   The children arrived at the six-story Shelter First angry.
Michelle gradually warmed up to the attention of the staff and used
the facility's learning center and play area. She began to "open up
and regain trust," said Gower.</TE>
<TE>   "She was probably happy and outgoing before she was homeless," she
added. "She became introverted and beaten down, but now she has
bounced back. Camp is her reward. She has managed to get through a
lot in her life."</TE>
<TE>   Every year since 1954, readers and employees of The Times have
sent thousands of needy children to summer camp. This year more than
11,000 children will experience a special summer, thanks to the $1.6
million raised last year.</TE>
<TE>   The average cost of sending a child to camp for a week is $150.
This year, the McCormick Tribune Foundation will match the first $1.2
million in contributions at 50 cents on the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Checks should be sent to: L.A. Times Summer Camp Campaign, File
No. 56984, Los Angeles, CA 90074-6984. For more information, call
(213) 237-5771. To make credit-card donations, visit www.
latimes.com/summercamp. Do not send cash.</TE>
<TE>   All donations are tax deductible. Unless donors request otherwise,
gifts of $25 or more are acknowledged in The Times. The summer camp
campaign is part of the Los Angeles Times Family Fund, a fund of the
McCormick Tribune Foundation.</TE>

<HD>Suburban Salute to the Little Girls of Summer</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I know about elbows. Woke up with one buried in my neck, like some
ancient Indian tool, a piece of sharpened bone. Alive, this elbow,
yet an instrument of death.</LD>
<LD>   "Happy Father's Day," the little girl says.</LD>
<LD>   "Your elbow?" I ask.</LD>
<TE>   "Sorry," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Across the bed, someone is rubbing an ankle. It's my wife. Turned
her ankle at the softball party the night before. The only sober one
in the bunch, and she steps in the one hole in Pete and Linda's
otherwise perfect yard. There's a lesson there if you look.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it bruised?" my wife asks, draping her pretty leg across my
pretty face.</TE>
<TE>   "Looks fine to me," I say.</TE>
<TE>   The boy enters the room scratching--up under his T-shirt, in the
hard-to-reach places. It's what some guys do instead of showering.
Scratch.</TE>
<TE>   "My friend Jeff broke his nose," the boy announces.</TE>
<TE>   "How?"</TE>
<TE>   "Playing basketball with Caswell," the boy explains.</TE>
<TE>   "He's all elbows, Caswell," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "He is," agrees the boy.</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to Father's Day, which begins with an elbow to my throat,
then a discussion of cocktail party injuries and assorted broken
bones. Fatherhood. What a thing to celebrate.</TE>
<TE>   "Buy you breakfast?" my wife offers.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe later," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Then it won't be breakfast," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "Later," I say anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Later, because last night we saluted the end of the little girl's
softball season with a feast of gossip, our suburb's favorite food,
and some slushy beverage that tasted like Ethanol.</TE>
<TE>   Three parts mix, one part tequila, a splash of triple sec. Lime if
you have it. Soon, everyone was happy.</TE>
<TE>   "She's seeing someone," our hostess says in the kitchen, speaking
of a mutual friend.</TE>
<TE>   "Who?"</TE>
<TE>   "Gary set them up. I don't think you know him."</TE>
<TE>   Out on the patio, they're talking about teenagers. We all agree we
love our teenagers. No matter what.</TE>
<TE>   "Something happens in their heads," says one mother.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing happens in their heads," insists another.</TE>
<TE>   Then the pause.</TE>
<TE>   "Hormones," someone finally says, and everyone nods and takes
another long sip.</TE>
<TE>   In the pool, the softball team splashes around, the girls of
summer, rinsing the infield dust from between their toes and soothing
their sunburned necks.</TE>
<TE>   "Marco!"</TE>
<TE>   "Polo!"</TE>
<TE>   "Marco!"</TE>
<TE>   "Polo!"</TE>
<TE>   Like a chain saw, this game. Been punishing parents for
generations.</TE>
<TE>   "Marco!"</TE>
<TE>   "Polo!"</TE>
<TE>   So the parents slurp their icy drinks and make small talk. I try
to make large talk, but it seldom works. In the suburbs, smaller is
better.</TE>
<TE>   "What are you guys doing this summer?" someone asks.</TE>
<TE>   "This, mostly," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "When's your renovation going to be done?" someone else asks.</TE>
<TE>   The question I dread. At every cocktail party, there's some
question you dread. This is my question.</TE>
<TE>   Ask me anything. Ask me about my recent physical or my sputtering
career. Ask me why Moises Alou can't scrape up a base hit or how
Enron gamed California's energy system. But please, don't bring up my
lingering, hellish house renovation.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey Coach, when's it going to be done?" I hear again, and eight
friends lean forward in their patio chairs.</TE>
<TE>   "2010," I finally say, and they laugh as if I'm joking.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, that's our target, which is obviously very optimistic. We
won't have tile picked out till at least 2008. By the time we pick a
paint, it'll be 2011. Crown moldings? Add two years.</TE>
<TE>   By the time our renovation is done, my wife will have remarried
three times. A cup of coffee will cost 20 bucks. Melissa Gilbert will
be governor.</TE>
<TE>   But I'm probably being optimistic. "Maybe 2012," I say, and they
still think I'm kidding.</TE>
<TE>   Over at the grill, my friend Craig is firing up some burgers. He's
one of those guys who can clean the grill, add ice to the beer tub,
tell four stories simultaneously, and still look like a guy who's
ready for prom.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, I'm looking like a guy who's been dragged by tractors
across a chicken farm. Coach Bill, my softball accomplice, notices
this and suggests we get on with our usual softball party
presentation.</TE>
<TE>   Like most comedy teams, we huddle briefly and without result. I
miss comedy teams. I can't think of a single current comedy team,
other than Bill and me. And we only appear in backyards like yours.</TE>
<TE>   "This year, let's do the Smothers Brothers," I suggest.</TE>
<TE>   "Again?"</TE>
<TE>   "You can be Dickie," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "I was Dickie last year," he says.</TE>
<TE>   And we give out the awards, first thanking all the parents, which
takes about an hour, then saluting the players, the Blue Bombing
Patriot Babes. I could tell you some stories of our season, but there
isn't time. Suffice to say that everyone did well and tried really,
really hard. One little girl broke her nose and another broke her
left hand but played two games before realizing it.</TE>
<TE>   No one was arrested and no one tested positive for anything,
including most of the parents. Even when we lost, the fans and the
media were pretty supportive.</TE>
<TE>   "We tip our caps to all of you, for all the support and all that
you do," says Coach Bill in a funny little poem he made up just for
tonight.</TE>
<TE>   In the kitchen, later, we spend two hours saying goodbye.</TE>
<TE>   "My husband keeps hugging people," complains Coach Lorraine as she
struggles to pull him out the door.</TE>
<TE>   "Hormones," I say, then offer her a hug that smells of hamburger
smoke and sunscreen. It's a good hug, warm as the coming summer.</TE>
<TE>   "Goodbye, Coach Bill," a little girl says.</TE>
<TE>   "Goodbye, Coach Chris," says another.</TE>
<TE>   Goodbye, you girls of summer. Too soon, as always.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last Wednesday I spent something like 25 minutes in Chinatown waiting
for the accident. Crawling down Broadway about 5:30 I found myself
engaged in one of the more unnerving habits of life in L.A., hoping
that whatever irritating bit of carnage--an overturned big rig, an
SUV burst into flames--was fairly close by.</LD>
<LD>   But as the inches passed by, I saw nothing, just two lanes of cars
you could have walked across like stepping stones. Arriving at home
with the sparking eyes of one whose 20-minute commute has just taken
more than an hour, I flung myself on my husband for comfort. He
looked at me as if I were mad. "Honey," he said, "the game started at
6."</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers game, of course, Game 4 of the finals which gave the
home team the NBA championship. Every freeway and surface street had
been jammed as rush hour, which normally extends well past 7, folded
over on itself as Angelenos all over town tried to get home by 6.</LD>
<TE>   I had not been in commuter hell; I had been trapped in a vortex of
civic pride.</TE>
<TE>   Some people think Angelenos have a hard time expressing themselves
as a community. They are wrong. We just are less about placards and
more about license plates. If you want to know what's going on in
town, all you have to do in this town is watch the roads. Is there a
Dodger game? The Harbor Freeway will tell you. If the western lanes
of the 10 and 134 are included in the traffic jam, that means the
team is doing particularly well.</TE>
<TE>   And let's not even talk about the L.A. marathon and other runs,
walks and races throughout the year. Stage an event that involves the
streets of this town and everyone participates. If not by handing out
tiny cups of Gatorade, then by barking oaths and hissing promises in
the attempt to find one street, one freaking street that doesn't end
in pylons and police tape.</TE>
<TE>   Parades, festivals and even seasons are inevitably prefaced, and
therefore flagged, by traffic. Are cars streaming downtown on a
weekday evening? It's Cinco de Mayo. Circling West Hollywood on a
midweek day at the end of October? That would be the Halloween
parade.</TE>
<TE>   How does an Angeleno know it's officially summer? Bad beach
traffic, surface-street madness around the Hollywood Bowl and
gridlock on Disney Way. In the winter, snowfall in the Angeles Forest
can be seen on a clear day from the hills of Glendale. And the
traffic winding up the mountain as desert-city denizens seek their 15
minutes of snow fights is just as visible.</TE>
<TE>   The knee-jerk reaction is to see this as a bad thing. But think
about it for a second.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, traffic provides a natural filter for events--if
you think the L.A. Times Book Festival is a zoo now, imagine how
crowded it would be if so many folks weren't put off by the fear of
driving, and looking for parking, in Westwood.</TE>
<TE>   And those large glittering objects moving south at the stately
speed of 5 mph as the tents of Cirque du Soleil rise into view aren't
just cars, they're people in cars. Protesters know this--sure, you'll
see the occasional picketing of City Hall, but when people really get
serious, they trawl the thoroughfares, waving their banners and
shouting their demands at the cars moving by. If we could figure out
a way by which people could vote by car phone, we might have a shot
at a true democracy.</TE>
<TE>   I wish I had thought of all this as I fumed my way through
Chinatown last week. I could have rolled down my windows and made a
few friends. This wasn't gridlock; it was a communal event, and I
didn't even have to bring lawn chairs.</TE>

<LD>Have you ever looked up in the sky at night, seen the moon and stars,
and wondered what else was out there that you couldn't see? Artist
Steve Roden has imagined just that. When he was a child he wanted to
be an astronaut. He learned that outer space was filled with
artificial satellites--human-made objects that orbit the Earth and
planets. He couldn't see them, but he saw photographs of them and
would read about them. He liked to imagine they were mysterious
stringless kites flying around by themselves.</LD>
<LD>   As a boy, Roden would always build models from kits, but not by
following the directions! Using his imagination, he would take three
or four kits and put them together to make something new that had
never been seen before. That experimentation helped him as an adult
when he made his own "satellites" out of wood, using equally sized
rectangular shapes. They didn't fly or look exactly like real
satellites, but their fanciful shapes and colors made his imagination
soar. Steve Roden's satellites and other artworks can be seen at the
Contemporary Arts Forum through July 7. For more information, call
(805) 966-5373 or visit www.sbcaf.org and check out CAF's Kids
Corner.</LD>

<DH>Pierre Koenig's steel-and-glass design blazed an
architectural trail that he still strides.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUNTER DROHOJOWSKA-PHILP</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Architect Pierre Koenig answers the door of the West L.A. home he
built in 1985 for himself and his wife, Gloria. At 77, he seems
younger, his curly gray hair and sparkling blue eyes accented by the
blue open-collar shirt and black Nike jacket he's wearing. Clearly,
he is pleased to give a tour of this home, built with his trademark
steel-and-glass materials; its open plan, with a 30-foot atrium, is
flooded with soft light. A pair of sea-green sofas flank a coffee
table topped with copies of the new book published by Taschen on the
Case Study Houses, the 1950s and '60s architectural experiment that
made Koenig's name, as well as a copy of "Iconic L.A.: Stories of
L.A.'s Most Memorable Buildings" (Balcony Press), written by his
wife.</LD>
<LD>   All is spare and refined here because the architect knows that the
secret to a clean modern lifestyle is adequate storage. His 6,000
record albums and stereo equipment are hidden behind a mirrored wall
partition.</LD>
<TE>   As Koenig walks a visitor through the 3,000-square-foot house, he
points out that its dimensions were predetermined by the
prefabricated steel he uses. "It's like a giant erector set," he
says. "The frame of the house was put up in one day. I use the same
technology as I did in 1950; it's an industrial approach." Glancing
through a window at the overcast sky, he adds, "It's a dismal day,
but the house is designed to get sun in the morning, and not the rest
of the day, so it stays naturally cool." With pride, he notes, "There
is no air-conditioning in any of my buildings."</TE>
<TE>   It is a good time for such retrospection; an exhibition of
Koenig's eight drawings and two models for his two most famous
houses, Case Study Houses No. 21 and No. 22, are on view at Craig
Krull Gallery in Santa Monica, along with photographs of the houses
by architectural photographer Julius Shulman. Though the pictures
capture the sybaritic lifestyle possible in such elegant
steel-and-glass houses, Koenig's drawings document the intellectual
rigor and formal purity of his buildings.</TE>
<TE>   In his office filled with drawing tables, computers and books,
Koenig, who is still a practicing architect, picks up a framed ink
drawing of his 1963 Iwata house in Monterey Park to make a point
about his drawing style. "This is a lost art," he says. "Nobody is
doing this anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "The computer has been a boon. It's so efficient," he says.
"Creativity is something else again. I still use pencil and paper to
draw."</TE>
<TE>   Drawing is what brought Koenig to architecture in the first place.
At Alhambra High School, he did cut-away drawings of airplanes in an
aeronautical drafting class. After serving in World War II, he
returned to San Gabriel to stay with his parents. At the local
library, he read the avant-garde bible of that time, Art and
Architecture magazine, which was founded by John Entenza and was the
sponsor of the Case Study program, founded in 1945, that enabled
adventurous Modernist architects such as Richard Neutra and Charles
and Ray Eames to construct innovative low-cost houses using
industrial materials. In the magazine, Koenig spotted drawings by
architect Paul Rudolph.</TE>
<TE>   "They appealed to me a lot. Instead of the usual washes, these
were pen and ink," he remembers. Seeing a similarity to his drawing
style, he decided to study architecture and industrial design at USC.
In 1950, while still a student, the ambitious Koenig built his first
house and sent the drawings to Entenza, who published them. After his
graduation two years later, Entenza asked him to be a part of the
Case Study program.</TE>
<TE>   After Koenig built his steel and glass Case Study House No. 21 in
1959, and No. 22 in 1960, Shulman's photographs of the finished homes
and Koenig's drawings for them were published in Art and
Architecture. They attracted attention to the young architect and
brought him clients. In fact, Case Study House No. 22, which stands
cantilevered on a hillside overlooking the lights of Los Angeles, has
become one of the most published images in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Looking at his drawing for the Iwata house, a geometric assembly
of roof lines and glass walls rendered in three-dimensional
perspective for clients Dr. Richard Iwata and his wife, he points to
shadows he rendered exactly as if they were cast at 3 p.m. on a day
in June. "It helps me and the client to understand where the sun is
going to prevail in the building," he explains. "That's why my
buildings, even with all that glass, don't have sun penetration in
the summer."</TE>
<TE>   Koenig says he believes most architects do not practice this
laborious technique of documenting the flow of light. "People don't
do what I do because it takes too much time. For me, it's a personal
thing, and I like to do it. It's how I get my pleasure out of life."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to having designed 50 houses, 42 of which were built,
and three commercial buildings, Koenig is director of the
undergraduate Building Science program at the USC School of
Architecture, where he is also distinguished professor. He recently
conceived a course on the Modern architecture of Southern California.
"The students often have the impression that there was no culture
here, when in fact it was the most creative explosion of Modern
architecture anywhere!" he says. "When I started preparing the
course, I was astounded. I started counting the names of architects
doing good Modern work here who got published, and I got over 100. No
other area of the world can match that."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the reason for such creativity is due to the topography of
the region. He says that in 1950s and 1960s, "hillside land was
inexpensive. You paid less for the land, so you could spend more on
the design. The first thing you had to have was an architect and an
engineer. In the hills, you had to have expertise, so the houses tend
to be unusual and better designed than in the flatlands." Koenig's
current home, on a flat, residential street, proves the exception to
his rule. He built his first house, for himself, in 1950, on a
hillside in Glendale.</TE>
<TE>   Koenig is clearly devoted to the Modernist aesthetic. "I think
Modern implies that some thought is going on. Modern is a way of
life, not a style," he says, adding that the Modernist mandate was to
build better houses for less money. "When I started, the rule of
thumb was that you spent one-tenth of the cost of the house for the
land. I now have one job where the lot cost more than the house!"
Case Study House No. 21, built for $20,000, recently sold for
$1,675,000.</TE>
<TE>   For Koenig, however, drawing remains the propeller of his
invention. With commissions for several houses in the works, he still
draws his designs with a pencil on paper. Later, he brings in the
computer. "You should design in your head. Otherwise, the building
will be static," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "The computer can't take the place of a brain. Yet."</TE>

<HD>A Writer's Flaw-Abiding Love of Country</HD>
<DH>Society's imperfections inspire Roger Rosenblatt's
affection, but so does the national desire for improvement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Originally, essayist and author Roger Rosenblatt thought of nine
reasons to love America.</LD>
<LD>   The native New Yorker's sudden and urgent need to express a deep
affection and devotion to country arose, as it did for many, after
the Sept. 11 attacks. The desire perhaps was made more acute for
Rosenblatt, who came of age during the tumultuous Vietnam War era,
when the patriotism of liberals like himself was continually
challenged.</LD>
<LD>   This time it wasn't a conservative questioning his love of
country, but his book editor. Nine reasons weren't enough to sell
books, Rosenblatt recalled Monday night while speaking in an author
series sponsored by the nonprofit group Writers Bloc.</LD>
<TE>   So the former Harvard writing professor came up with 21 more
reasons, resulting in "Where We Stand: 30 Reasons for Loving Our
Country" (Harcourt, 2002). But in his hourlong talk at Temple Emanuel
in Beverly Hills, it was clear that Rosenblatt could have easily come
up with 300 or 3,000 more reasons to love his country.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenblatt's patriotism is not of the blindly flag-waving variety.
It's nuanced, complex and, oddly enough, funny.</TE>
<TE>   He loves America for its flaws and for its evolved desire to
constantly improve itself. He loves America for its free speech, its
tolerance of differences, and for the "darndest things" its leaders
say.</TE>
<TE>   To much laughter, Rosenblatt recounted the following statements
from former heads of state:</TE>
<TE>   * Richard Nixon, standing at the Great Wall of China: "You'll have
to admit this is a great wall."</TE>
<TE>   * Gerald Ford: "I always watch the Detroit Tigers on the radio
when I can."</TE>
<TE>   * The elder George Bush, on his 1988 reelection bid: "The
undecideds could go either way."</TE>
<TE>   But not every president contributed, Rosenblatt added. "The great
disappointment about Clinton was that while he behaved peculiarly,"
said Rosenblatt, "he rarely said anything peculiar."</TE>
<TE>   As if Clinton weren't enough to remind us, Rosenblatt went on to
counter the myth that America somehow lost its innocence or a goodly
portion of it on Sept. 11. That observation is only true if you
define innocence as "being taken by surprise by an aerial attack."</TE>
<TE>   In his essay "We're Not That Innocent" (yes, he gives a nod to the
Britney Spears song), Rosenblatt said there's never been much
innocent about America. Slaughter of natives, slavery, exploitation
of workers, and the list goes on and on. What he loves about America
is its recognition of these wrongs and its desire to correct the
mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   He underlined the point by quoting theologian Reinhold Niebuhr:
"Our capacity for justice makes democracy possible, and our capacity
for injustice makes democracy necessary."</TE>
<TE>   The night was billed as a talk between Rosenblatt and Norman Lear,
the famous television producer who gave us "All in the Family" and
"Sanford and Son." But for reasons not entirely clear, the successful
give-and-take formula between authors was abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Lear gave a brief introduction for Rosenblatt and left
the stage. Only after Rosenblatt finished his presentation did Lear
return. And then the television producer and political activist
proved himself as comically cranky, albeit in a liberal way, as his
Archie Bunker.</TE>
<TE>   The pair fielded questions from the audience, but Lear, usually in
tongue-in-cheek manner, did most of the fielding.</TE>
<TE>   When asked how the pair became friends, Lear was noncommittal,
then mentioned that he and Rosenblatt "had been married for four
months." When told by an earnest 20-something that members of her
generation didn't seem to spend much time talking to each other, Lear
suggested she get her contemporaries to smoke pot.</TE>
<TE>   The speakers missed an opportunity to invigorate the discussion
when they failed to take on a question from the audience about
whether or not American actions might have provoked the September
attacks. The "blowback" argument goes that America had it coming
after decades of self-serving policies in Afghanistan and the Persian
Gulf region.</TE>
<TE>   Lear quickly dismissed the point as irrational, while Rosenblatt
gave no response.</TE>
<TE>   A question about the post 9/11 flag-waving seemed to draw the most
impassioned and noncomical response from Lear. Flags are symbols, he
said, and as such have little intrinsic value. What has a great deal
of value, he went on, were the principles on which the nation was
founded. For those, the World War II veteran said, he would fight
another war to defend. For those, he added for emphasis, he would
fight in 19 more to preserve.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Not long ago, the English novelist Faye Weldon created a minor
literary controversy when she agreed to write a novel commissioned by
the Italian jeweler Bulgari. In return for a still-undisclosed but
reportedly quite handsome fee, the writer promised to mention the
firm's products at least 12 times in the course of her narrative.</LD>
<LD>   Actually, Weldon--who once worked for an advertising
agency--exceeded the terms of her contract many times over,
sprinkling Bulgari references through her plot like pave diamonds and
crowning the exercise by titling the book "The Bulgari Connection."</LD>
<LD>   A predictable debate ensued. Weldon, a practiced controversialist,
airily dismissed her critics. "Who cares?" she said, "I never win the
Booker Prize anyway."</LD>
<TE>   The whole affair was sensibly summed up by her friend, the
Booker-winning Australian novelist Thomas Keneally, who called
Weldon's arrangement "an act of defiance and mischief" intended to
put the British literary establishment on notice that while a novel
is "something imponderable, it's also a commercial artifact, so don't
be so solemn about it."</TE>
<TE>   Keneally suggested that if he and his colleagues "took Faye's
option to the limit, we all could auction off our books, particularly
the handsome parts, the characters who get all the sex and all the
money."</TE>
<TE>   Nobody got the chance, however, since Weldon's novel sold poorly,
which seemed to put a period to the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Or at least it did until a few days ago, when the Wall Street
Journal reported  that one of the world's largest advertising holding
companies, Interpublic Group, has hired an investment banking house
to help it purchase a major literary agency. The ad conglomerate also
hopes to buy a significant Hollywood talent agency.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Interpublic nor its banker, Allen &amp; Co., would comment,
but their goal seems clear to analysts. Increasing numbers of viewers
use new technologies to skip the ads on cable and free television, (a
practice that one network executive recently argued amounts to
theft.) As a result, advertisers have become preoccupied with weaving
their products directly and visibly into films, miniseries and
dramatic specials. Such "product placement" could be undertaken on an
unprecedented scale by an ad agency not only able to control the
content of books and stories through ownership of a literary agency,
but also able to steer the right properties to its own talent agency
and out the other end of the electronic pipeline. At each phase of
the process, "the content" could be studded with clients' products.</TE>
<TE>   What might makers of cigarettes, soft drinks, automobiles or
clothing pay for that kind of subtle and relentless access to
consumers' hearts and minds? A lot. Fortune 500 companies already pay
major Hollywood agencies such as CAA and Endeavor major money for
advice on just such marketing strategies.</TE>
<TE>   Writers may soon get their chance to do just what Keneally
laughingly proposed.</TE>
<TE>   How does that prospect strike serious literary agents?</TE>
<TE>   Georges Borchardt is one of that vocation's elder statesmen. As
president of the Georges Borchardt Agency in New York, his current
clients range from Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel to English novelist Ian
McEwan and California authors T. Coraghessan Boyle and Richard
Rodriguez. The first author Borchardt represented was Albert Camus;
the first book he ever sold was "The Stranger."</TE>
<TE>   So what does he make of Interpublic's apparent aims?</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds pretty dreadful," Borchardt said. "I would view it as a
form of prostitution. We put in our contract that publishers can't
place advertising inserts of any sort in our authors' books. But at
least ad inserts are clearly identified and readers who encounter
them can always do what I do with them in magazines--which is to tear
out the ads--and read the articles."</TE>
<TE>   Imagine, Borchardt suggested, what kind of mischief might be
accomplished if an agency of such a mind were to gain control of an
important "backlist" of previously published books. "They could sneak
all sorts of things in," he mused. "You might find a character in,
say, Dostoevsky suddenly drinking a particular brand of vodka. It is
bizarre.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately there is today a certain kind of novel--not the
sort we've involved with--where every character wears brand-name
clothes, smokes certain kinds of cigarettes and drives particular
sorts of cars. I imagine the people who read those books begin to
dream about wearing the clothes their favorite character wore. So, I
suppose this thing would work--up to a point."</TE>
<TE>   And how would Borchardt respond if Interpublic's bankers were to
come knocking on his agency's door?</TE>
<TE>   "Normally, my honest answer would be that every man has a price,"
he said. "But I also would have to tell them honestly that none of
our authors would go for this and that they should go somewhere else.
And I suppose they would."</TE>
<TE>   Work in Progress</TE>
<TE>   Robert Pinsky, former poet laureate of the United States, is
poetry editor of the online magazine Slate. His many books include a
translation of "The Inferno of Dante:"</TE>
<TE>   "I have a few things going. In the fall, Princeton University
Press will publish a little 100-page book that collects the Tanner
Lectures I gave there. It's called 'Democracy, Culture and the Voice
of Poetry.' One of the things I engaged in those talks is the idea
that poetry is definitely a vocal art, but not a performative one.</TE>
<TE>   "My distinction is that while poetry should not be performed from
a stage before an audience, it should--even must--be read aloud. You
might read a poem aloud to yourself or you might, for example, read
the poem to your mate. For a culture preoccupied by show business,
the big point is that poetry is about intimate scale. That's very
precious to us when so many things in our society are on a mass
scale. So, when I say 'voice' in that book title, I mean it quite
literally. But the voice of poetry is not the voice of theater, the
movies or rap music.</TE>
<TE>   "The really nutty thing I'm doing right now is working on an
opera, which is going to involve robots. I'm collaborating with the
composer Tod Machover, who is affiliated with the Media Lab at MIT.
We're both working with a brilliant young roboticist there, as well.
At the moment, we're thinking that some of the roles will be played
by robots and we're also thinking that the libretto will borrow from
'The Inferno of Dante.'</TE>
<TE>   "We've already written an aria, which was performed not long ago
at a dinner in Monaco for the Friends of the Monte Carlo Opera, who
commissioned this work.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an important question in the 'Inferno'--and in life--of
whether consciousness is always self-destructive. Do we in our
cleverness always end up hurting ourselves? We're going to take a
sympathetic view of the robots."</TE>

<HD>Villainy and Murder in the Louisiana Underworld</HD>
<DH>James Lee Burke spins more poetic prose into a story that's
set in bayou territory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DICK LOCHTE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Several of James Lee Burke's more recent novels about Louisiana
lawman Dave Robicheaux have been examples of style over substance.
This is not meant as a complaint, exactly; not when you're dealing
with a stylist whose poetic way with words is stunningly effective,
whether being used to describe bayou tranquillity or barroom
violence. Unlike others in the literary brother- and sisterhood who
go for the flow even when it results in meaningless babble, Burke
crafts paragraphs as cohesive as they are mesmerizing.</LD>
<LD>   Here's a sample from the 10th and current entry in the Robicheaux
series, "Jolie Blon's Bounce" (Simon &amp; Schuster, $25, 349 pages).
It's a description of the protagonist/narrator's reaction to a melody
by Guitar Slim.</LD>
<LD>   "Without ever using words to describe either the locale or the era
in which he had lived, his song re-created the Louisiana I had been
raised in: the endless fields of sugarcane thrashing in the wind
under a darkening sky, yellow dirt roads and the Hadacol and Jax beer
signs nailed to the side of general stores, horse-drawn buggies that
people tethered in stands of gum trees during Sunday Mass, clapboard
juke joints where Gatemouth Brown and Smiley Lewis and Lloyd Price
played, and the brothel districts that flourished from sunset to dawn
and somehow became invisible in the morning light."</LD>
<TE>   It may seem picky to want a strong, original main theme to
accompany such appealing riffs. On occasion, such as Robicheaux's
last outing, "Purple Cane Road," Burke provides it. "Bounce" settles
for variations on earlier compositions.</TE>
<TE>   The book is not shy of event, what with Dave puzzling through two
murders--the victims are a teen queen and a drug-addicted
prostitute--while battling his own addiction to painkillers, the
result of a brutal and emasculating beating at the hands of a
septuagenarian hard case named Legion Guidry. But much of it seems
like a familiar refrain. The persecuted, immensely talented Cajun
blues singer, the saintly drifter, the scion guarding the secret
scandal of his aristocratic family, the offspring of a Mafia goon
suffering from sins of the father, and the smarmy show-biz carrion
have all drifted through previous Dave capers.</TE>
<TE>   So have the incredibly evil, possibly supernatural villains,
though, as the author explains on the abridged audio version of the
novel (though not on the unabridged), these particular bad boys--the
aforementioned Legion and a Bible drummer named Marvin Oates--are
part of his first use of biblical allegory.</TE>
<TE>   The specific reference is the New Testament tale in which Jesus
Christ encounters a man possessed by an evil demon named Legion.
Christ casts out the demon and sends it into the body of a herd of
swine that waddles into the ocean to drown. That Burke is able to
work his novel to a point where a Christlike figure (not Dave, I
should note) confronts the vile Guidry within casting distance of
pigs is no minor achievement.</TE>
<TE>   He even manages to bring this off while stirring up considerable
suspense over the fate of his hero's only friend, Clete Purcel, who
lies bleeding to death while the epic good versus evil battle takes
place. Since Purcel, one of the most likable reprobates in modern
fiction, has provided tang throughout the Robicheaux saga, it seems
unlikely that he'll be joining Legion and the pigs in the nether
world. But one can never be sure about these things. Authors, even
those as canny as Burke, can and have made such fatal mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   Adultery and Homicide in N.Y.'s High Society</TE>
<TE>   Jane Stanton Hitchcock's "Social Crimes" (Talk Miramax Books,
$22.95, 368 pages) is a novel of adultery and homicide among
Manhattan's elite that reads like Dominick Dunne lite. The book's
heroine and narrator, Jo Slater, announces at its start, "Murder was
never my goal in life." Regrettably, her real life goal is much less
compelling: She wants to reign as the WASP queen of New York society.
What else might we expect from a woman who has chosen Marie
Antoinette as a role model?</TE>
<TE>   Hitchcock keeps the reader hanging on for nearly two-thirds of the
book with a plot that plays out like a high society "All About Eve,"
in which an outwardly demure, impoverished little French countess
enters Jo's perfect life and rapidly replaces her in it. Students of
the East Coast social swim may detect some allusions to actual people
or events hidden in the author's fiction. Such gossipy frills
notwithstanding, the book takes a few steps down in class once the
usurpation is complete.</TE>
<TE>   As Somerset Maugham, Truman Capote and other acclaimed chroniclers
of the upper crust have shown us, these spoiled, elite monsters are
best observed through the eyes of an observer who is at least
partially objective. By allowing Jo to tell us her own story,
Hitchcock may have hoped to make the reader a co-conspirator in the
eventual murder plot. But, as the self-absorbed widow grows ever more
unpleasant and her homicidal preparations more convoluted (involving
a prostitute who is the countess' spitting image, among other
incredible elements), readers may decide to bid her a premature
farewell and pick up the latest issue of Vanity Fair instead.</TE>
<TE>   Racial Violence on the</TE>
<TE>   Mean Streets of L.A.</TE>
<TE>   With last year's "The Orange Curtain," John Shannon's series
featuring private detective Jack Liffey made the successful leap from
paperback originals into hardcover. That strong, socially conscious
hard-boiled tale charted a number of nightmare offramps along the
Southern California dream freeway. The author's new "Streets of Fire"
(Carroll &amp; Graff/Otto Penzler, $24, 230 pages) is even more
relentless in its portrait of Los Angeles as Trouble City.</TE>
<TE>   As Shannon sees it, one racist cop could trigger Armageddon with a
careless chokehold. In this case, it results in the death of a
popular Dodger pitcher who also happens to be a black Muslim. Liffey
observes the rapidly spreading riot mood at mean street level. A
detective pal (Gary Phillips' series sleuth Ivan Monk) has passed him
a job. A respected member of the black community needs someone to
find his adopted son who has gone missing with his white Simi Valley
girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   Their trail takes the humane investigator into an assortment of
angry camps--from white supremacist to black separatist--all gearing
up for the inevitable confrontation and bristling with hatred for
anyone poking into their affairs. That would be Liffey.</TE>
<TE>   If trying to stay alive and get his job done were not challenge
enough, he is also being forced to come to grips with his muddled
personal life.</TE>
<TE>   Shannon's lean prose makes good use of local history without
letting it slow down his hero's progress. When added to his deadpan
approach to L.A.'s theater of the absurd atmosphere, this should be
enough to satisfy anyone seeking a strong sense of place in a novel,
particularly one that also provides a powerful crime yarn with a
full-blown riot payoff.</TE>

<LD>Matt read the answer that his sister, Rachel, had printed in the
crossword puzzle. " 'Crateorbox.' I think that's right. Mom told us
to run the words together."</LD>
<LD>   "Before we do any more of the puzzle," Rachel said, "Mom has to
take me to the crafts store so I can get pipe cleaners for my school
project. And then she wants to get some tomatoes at the grocery
store. Do you want to come?"</LD>
<LD>   "All right," Matt said.</LD>
<TE>   On the way to the crafts store Matt said, "Uncle Don's letter said
that we have to get the things in the crossword puzzle. Maybe we can
get a crate or a box at the grocery store."</TE>
<TE>   "That's a good idea!" Rachel said.</TE>
<TE>   They got the pipe cleaners and then went to the grocery store.</TE>
<TE>   "What size crate do you want?" the produce man asked. "What are
you going to use it for?"</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know," Matt said. "We were just told to get a crate or a
box."</TE>
<TE>   "Hmmmm," the produce man said. "In that case, let me give you a
box. You can cut it down if it's too big."</TE>
<TE>   And he got them a big box.</TE>
<TE>   "Put the box in the pantry for now," their mother said when they
got home.</TE>
<TE>   While Matt was putting away the box, Rachel opened the package of
pipe cleaners and took one out. She poked the pipe cleaner through
some pieces of macaroni.</TE>
<TE>   "What's that supposed to be?" Matt asked.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm making a dog," Rachel said. "This is the body."</TE>
<TE>   She bent one end of the pipe cleaner so that it pointed up.
"That's the tail," she said. Then she bent the other end up too.
"This is the neck and head."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh," Matt said. "Before you finish your dog, how about doing some
more of the puzzle?"</TE>
<TE>   "OK," Rachel said. She sat down at the table and picked up the
pencil.</TE>
<TE>   "Third clue," Matt said. "No. 3 across. Its ticking will keep your
present company during the night."</TE>
<TE>   "Ticking!" Rachel said. "There's only one thing I know of that
ticks!" And she printed the answer in the spaces.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday: What ticks? Will the next clue tell them more about the
present?</TE>

<HD>It's What's Inside That Counts</HD>
<DH>Stylists are turning inward, rethinking the auto interior
to satisfy drivers who crave more utility and creature comforts</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The automotive interior, once relegated to beginners in the styling
center, is becoming the designer's new frontier.</LD>
<LD>   "Cars are getting more and more functional, and the exteriors
aren't making the personality and lifestyle statements they used to,"
said Ken Okuyama, chairman of the transportation design department at
the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. "We are getting into a
new phase in which the interior is becoming more important and the
exterior more neutral."</LD>
<LD>   That might sound blasphemous, coming from a designer who worked on
the forthcoming Ferrari FX and the current-generation Chevrolet
Corvette. But those are specialty cars, Okuyama said, and there
always will be a place in the world for niche models that make
statements.</LD>
<TE>   But in the mainstream auto market, he said, splashy exteriors come
and go. The cycle has turned to cocooning, with auto buyers,
especially in the fast-growing U.S. luxury market, more concerned
about their immediate environments than the images their vehicles
project to those looking at the outside.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson Controls Inc., a major developer of automotive components
and equipment, agrees with Okuyama's thinking and recently unveiled a
concept for a next-generation luxury vehicle. It is designed around
the idea that people are spending more and more time in their
vehicles and are seeking environments that can be adapted to work and
leisure.</TE>
<TE>   John Krsteski, who designed the Ariston Concept interior for
Johnson Controls, said the project evolved from the company's studies
in Europe and North America of what buyers want in a luxury vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   "We found that luxury isn't just a statement that you can make by
styling or by adding luxurious appointments like wood trim," he said.
"It is an experience, like going to a fine restaurant and having the
maitre d' present you with the menu. It starts as you get in, and it
includes all your surroundings and instruments" just as tableware and
upholstery fabrics help establish a luxurious restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   In the Ariston study, that meant that the interior designers
dictated certain exterior treatments, including doors that open wide
and without obstruction to invite the driver and other occupants.</TE>
<TE>   Owners of luxury vehicles place a premium on people space over
luggage space, the Johnson Control team found, so the passenger cabin
was lengthened, moving the back seat farther into what typically
would be trunk space, to provide a more limousine-like roominess.</TE>
<TE>   "And we found that people, even in the luxury market, also are
moving to sport utility vehicles because they like the command
seating and the sense of security, so we raised the roof line and the
seat height," said Krsteski, showing off the Ariston Concept at a
recent one-day design event in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The Johnson Controls interior study also demands a
higher-than-usual belt line--the point along the side of a vehicle
where sheet metal meets window glass--to provide more space in the
doors for concealed storage and more depth in the interior to
increase occupants' sense of being cushioned.</TE>
<TE>   Krsteski carried the restaurant analogy deeper into the car with
an instrument panel that "serves" its devices on demand and stores
them when not in use to present the appearance of a clean tabletop.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, the steering wheel is a prototype that folds flat and slips
into a concealed position inside the fabric-covered dashboard. The
wheel emerges and locks into operating position with the touch of a
button when the driver enters the car, and it stows away at the end
of a trip "to announce that you are at the end of the journey,"
Krsteski said.</TE>
<TE>   The instrument panel itself pops up when the car is running and
folds flat when the ignition is off.</TE>
<TE>   The clean dash that occupants see at the start and finish of a
trip "lets each journey become a fresh start," the designer said.</TE>
<TE>   Luxury also is about not being bothered by the things you don't
need, he said. So the Ariston design eliminates the visual clutter of
dash-mounted air vents, hiding them under the dash.</TE>
<TE>   The instrument panel uses digital readouts and lets the driver
call up information as needed.</TE>
<TE>   "You control this environment," Krsteski said. "You are the
captain. And the instruments surround the driver, so the passengers
don't have to be bothered or distracted."</TE>
<TE>   The concept considers passengers as individuals, so each seating
position has its primary function.</TE>
<TE>   One is a business center, with a desktop that pulls out from the
back of the driver's seat and a docking station that will accept
telephones, fax machines and laptop computers.</TE>
<TE>   Another is configured for relaxation, with padded armrests, a
footrest, individual headsets for the audio system and a lounge-style

that could be built separately by an outside vendor and installed in

possible.</TE>

<HD>But Will It Come in Day-Glo? VW Microbus Returns for 2005</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John O'Dell</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Volkswagen has confirmed what long has been expected: It will build a
Microbus based on the concept shown 18 months ago at the North
American International Auto Show in Detroit.</LD>
<LD>   The new Microbus will be built in Germany, but about two-thirds of
the annual production will be sent to the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Bernd Pischetsrieder, VW's chief executive, said the company will
concentrate on U.S. sales because the old Microbus, discontinued in
1992, was--and continues to be--a cult object in this country.</LD>
<TE>   Of particular note, VW plans to build more the first year than in
subsequent years--a reversal of the distressing trend in which
first-year production of a potentially popular vehicle is kept so low
that huge waiting lists develop and dealers, as well as private
speculators, are able to demand thousands of dollars above the
sticker price.</TE>
<TE>   VW said first-year production of the Microbus, to be launched in
2005, will be about 120,000 units, with annual production dropping to
about 80,000 units after that.</TE>
<TE>   The auto maker launched the Microbus in 1950. Sales peaked at
67,000 units in 1970.</TE>

<LD>If there was any doubt, here's more data supporting the complaint
that Californians have to spend more to own a car than residents of
any other state.</LD>
<LD>   Edmunds.com, the auto Web site and buying service, has collated
information from new-car dealers, motor vehicle departments, insurers
and other automotive sources in all 50 states and found that for the
2002 model year, there's a 20% difference in new-car ownership costs
between South Carolina (the least expensive state) and California
(the most expensive).</LD>
<LD>   Jose Luis Munoz, data coordinator for Santa Monica-based Edmunds,
said that although gasoline, insurance and even purchase prices all
are a bit higher in California than in most other states, the real
culprits are motor vehicle registration fees and sales taxes.</LD>
<TE>   The average price of a 2002 model sold new in South Carolina was
$25,624. After all the ownership costs for a five-year period are
factored in--including maintenance and repairs--the true cost of
ownership there is $35,776, Munoz said.</TE>
<TE>   That contrasts with an average selling price of $25,810 in
California and a true cost of $42,927.</TE>
<TE>   Although selling prices in California are only marginally greater
than those in South Carolina, our motor vehicle fees averaged $1,428,
versus just $77 in the Palmetto State. And South Carolina's average
$300 sales tax on a new vehicle paled by comparison with California's
$2,187, Munoz found.</TE>

<LD>Buying and selling used cars shouldn't have to be an ordeal.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, there are honest buyers and sellers out there. But if
you've ever encountered an unethical used-car salesperson or a
dishonest buyer, then you know that vehicle transactions can be about
as pleasant as having your fingernails pulled.</LD>
<LD>   Even if you bypass a dealership and decide to buy your dream car
from a private party, you may end up spending hours scanning the
classified ads or auto sale magazines that cater to buyers and
sellers of used vehicles.</LD>
<TE>   If you're lucky, your hot prospect ends up being only a mile or
two away. Then again, you could be unlucky enough to drive 20 miles
in rush-hour traffic to check out a vehicle, only to learn it was
sold to someone else while you were idling on the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Sellers of used vehicles have their woes. No-shows who break
appointments and worries about dealing with unsavory types can be a
hassle. Then there's the negotiation process, which can be difficult
no matter which side of the transaction you're on.</TE>
<TE>   So it's no wonder that many buyers and sellers of used and
collector vehicles are doing business via the Internet--an electronic
marketplace in which there's no face-to-face haggling or creepy guys
coming to your house.</TE>
<TE>   When buyers go cyber shopping for a used car, they are "really in
the driver's seat. They control the process and can shop whenever
they like," says Simon Rothman, vice president and general manager of
EBay Motors.</TE>
<TE>   There are numerous online services geared to buying and selling
used vehicles, classic cars and exotics. For instance, IMotors.com
(www.imotors.com) allows users to order a certified used car and have
it delivered. New-car seller CarsDirect.com (www.carsdirect.com)
recently launched a used-car program, and Usedcars.com (www
.usedcars.com) says it carries more than 400,000 used-car listings
online.</TE>
<TE>   Cars.com (www.cars.com)--a car-buying information company in which
the Los Angeles Times' owner, Tribune Co., holds a stake--includes
used-car listings on its site, and AutoNationDirect.com
(www.autonation.com) helps buyers search for cars, compute monthly
payments or find a dealer in their area.</TE>
<TE>   Carfax.com (www.carfax.com) provides vehicle history reports.
Kelley Blue Book's Web site, www.kbb.com, offers information on
used-car values and prices. Consumers can compare state automotive
"lemon" laws on www .lemonlawamerica.com. There is even a
site--usedcarbuyingguide .com--that offers tips for women.</TE>
<TE>   EBay, though, claims to be the Internet's largest marketplace for
buying and selling used cars, motorcycles and anything automotive.
More than 7 million people use the Internet auction site www
.ebaymotors.com every month. Rothman says he expects more than $2.6
billion worth of vehicles to be sold through EBay this year.</TE>
<TE>   The primary reason is that bidding online for a used vehicle
eliminates the "contentious nature of the relationship between buyer
and seller," Rothman says. Consumers have indicated in surveys and
studies that of all the aspects of buying a car, the negotiating
process is the most disliked.</TE>
<TE>   If wheeling and dealing online still makes you a bit squeamish,
the site has launched EBay Assurance Program for Vehicles, a service
designed to make selling and buying a vehicle online safer. Consumers
are offered limited warranties, purchase insurance, payment
protection and mobile vehicle inspection. Some of the services are
free; others can be purchased by buyers and sellers.</TE>
<TE>   The limited warranty is free and offers protection for one month
or 1,000 miles against major mechanical failure of the powertrain.
Purchase insurance--maximum $20,000 with a $500 deductible--also is
available at no cost that protects buyers against fraud or material
misrepresentation of any passenger-vehicle purchased on the EBay
Motors site.</TE>
<TE>   EBay's $99.95 mobile vehicle inspection plan provides a thorough
assessment of the vehicle by a professional inspector. Sellers can
buy an inspection and post the results online to give potential
buyers some extra assurance. Or buyers can pay for the inspection if
the seller won't, and make a purchase agreement contingent on the
results.</TE>
<TE>   If sellers or buyers are caught misrepresenting information, EBay
Motors will "expel those folks from the site," Rothman says.
Interestingly, he says, "there is a lot of self-policing on the site
that prevents bad things from happening."</TE>
<TE>   A feedback rating that allows buyers to view a seller's track
record online is crucial in making users feel safer purchasing
vehicles via the Internet. You can get a fairly good idea of how
trustworthy repeat sellers are by reading previous buyers' comments.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like going to a dealership and seeing a report card from
everyone who ever purchased a car from them posted outside the
door.... Not everyone needs to kick the tires on a vehicle" before
they buy, Rothman says.</TE>
<TE>   As far as pricing goes, there are some good deals online. But if
you live in Los Angeles and are buying a vehicle from a seller across
the country, there could be hefty shipping fees involved. Although
the buyer typically pays for shipping, the parties often negotiate an
agreement to split delivery fees, Rothman says.</TE>
<TE>   No question, buying or selling vehicles online offers convenience
and privacy.</TE>
<TE>   But I disagree with Rothman's assertion that the Internet has made
"kicking the tires" no longer important to consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I can't get used to the idea of
purchasing a car based on a photo and description posted on the
Internet without checking it out myself and taking a test-drive.</TE>
<TE>   It sounds a little too much like buying a mail-order bride.</TE>

<HD>Paul Oakenfold Connects With His Audience</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BALTIN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul Oakenfold has received more mainstream pop attention than any
other DJ, so now he's ripe for a backlash. There are those who claim
the Englishman is the beneficiary of a lot of hype, that his greatest
talent is self-promotion and that he reached the U.S. at just the
right time.</LD>
<LD>   Those arguments may have some validity, but the point those
detractors miss is that no DJ today can work a crowd into a frenzy
like Oakenfold. He proved it at the Coachella Festival in Indio in
April, and he reaffirmed it with Monday's two-hour set at the Mayan
Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   In town on the eve of the release of "Bunkka," his first album of
original material, Oakenfold got off to a slow start despite the
enthusiastic crowd, which greeted him with chants of "Oakie" when the
curtain rose. For the first half of the show he often left long
pauses between songs, something uncharacteristic for a dance music
event. While the audience, which treated the night more like a rock
concert than a DJ set anyway, used those gaps to applaud, they would
have exploded had he followed through on any of the room-filling
synthesizer trance hooks that he teased them with.</LD>
<TE>   Whether it took Oakenfold a while to warm up or he was just saving
up for the big finish, the closing was well worth the wait. Beginning
with a remix of the Dirty Vegas techno hit "Days Go By," Oakenfold
wove a finale that included deep and expansive trance melodies
leading into U2's "Where the Streets Have No Name," the song he spun
last New Year's Eve at midnight on Hollywood Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   If "Where the Streets Have No Name" is a bit of an obvious song,
it doesn't change the fact that at such moments Oakenfold made a
genuine connection with his audience.</TE>
<TE>   Having studied at the school of arena rock (he's opened for U2
overseas), Oakenfold is an unparalleled showman on the dance circuit.
And that's probably the best explanation of all for the success he's
achieved.</TE>

<HD>Hip-Hop's Slump: A Blip or a Trend?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFF BOUCHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With Eminem prowling the top of the sales charts and Nelly waiting in
the wings with a highly anticipated new release, it would seem that
rap is as potent as ever at music stores. And there's no doubt that
hip-hop has become inseparably woven into the whole cloth of American
youth culture.</LD>
<LD>   So why is there a murmur of discontent beneath the beats?</LD>
<LD>   Sales of hip-hop albums in the first quarter of 2002 were down an
eye-opening 26% from the same period last year, by far the largest
drop among major pop genres, and longtime observers on the scene have
been grumbling that innovation and star power are on the wane.</LD>
<TE>   There are other challenges too: Rap concerts have never matured to
rival the genre's record sales, and the music's young fans are so
enamored with fresh sounds that it has been nearly impossible for
artists to create long-term relevancy.</TE>
<TE>   The youth of its fans also makes hip-hop one of the ripest targets
for online music theft--no other age group is as active on the
Internet or as likely to feel it's acceptable to pilfer music via
downloadable files.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say the health of hip-hop is down, but I would say the
health of traditional prerecorded label music is down too," said
Violet Brown, the lead urban music buyer for the Wherehouse chain.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of burning [of homemade CDs] in hip-hop and a lot
of bootlegging.... A friend of mine teaches and says flat out that
10th-, 11th- and 12th-grade kids do not buy prerecorded music; they
only gets 'boots' that are leaked early on the [Internet] sites."</TE>
<TE>   "The Eminem Show," the blockbuster release that will on its own
buoy the genre's second-quarter sales, was abruptly moved up on the
release schedule last month after Interscope, the rapper's record
label, cited rampant trafficking of the music online and on street
corners.</TE>
<TE>   But even with all that, the sharp decline in first-quarter rap
sales charted by the Nielsen SoundScan tracking service may have more
deeply rooted causes.</TE>
<TE>   "Business has been bad overall, but a lot of the rock releases are
doing extremely well," Brown said. "That's part of what's going on.
The same customers who buy rock-rap buy rap. They are definitely
sharing the same consumer."</TE>
<TE>   Consumer surveys show that the majority of rap album buyers are
suburban white males in their teens. And a significant chunk of that
base has turned in the past few years to guitar-driven bands that tap
into hip-hop beats and rap-style vocals, often with an aggressive
sonic presence. Rage Against the Machine may have made the template
for the sound, but Limp Bizkit and Korn were the bands that made it
an MTV-friendly music sensation.</TE>
<TE>   Hip-hop is no afterthought, of course. The Recording Industry
Assn. of America's survey of 2001 sales showed that rap and hip-hop
accounted for 11.4% of all U.S. music releases shipped by the
industry in 2001, its second-highest percentage in a decade and
trailing only rock releases (24.4% of all shipments) and pop (12.1%).</TE>
<TE>   No one expects rap or hip-hop to disappear, but is it in danger of
losing the vibrancy that has made it the most exciting real estate on
the pop music landscape in the past 20 years? The sharp first-quarter
sales decline might be explained away by a lack of high-profile
releases, but some observers say the genre may also have a drought of
true superstars.</TE>
<TE>   Eminem has ascended to a stratum of his own, Jay-Z remains a
powerhouse (the disappointing sales of his recent "Best of Both
Worlds" seem due to the controversy surrounding his collaborator on
the album, R&amp;B singer R. Kelly) and OutKast has been able to meld
critical acclaim with platinum sales, but after that there are
questions about the longevity and heft of the genre's other young
artists.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see the new stars pushing things forward, not like the
generations before them," esteemed rap video director Hype Williams
said. "I wish I did."</TE>
<TE>   Some observers point to the deaths of superstars such as 2Pac and
the Notorious B.I.G., but others blame the genre's culture of cash
competition and the narrow thematic focus of hard-core street rap;
the former pushes toward the predictable mainstream where wide
audiences can be found, while the latter creates a repetitious
revisiting of topics that rarely feels fresh or edgy anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Lyor Cohen, chairman of Island Def Jam Recordings, has been a
player in the rap world since its 1980s growth from sidewalk
sensation to pop-culture force. He sees the first-quarter sales
decline as a statistical blip on the screen, but he does sense that
hip-hop is doing some soul-searching.</TE>
<TE>   Just as rock 'n' roll went from an unpredictable, grass-roots
sensation in the 1950s to a political force in the '60s to a
corporate-informed existence in the '70s, hip-hop finds itself two
decades old and feeling the tugs of art and commerce.</TE>
<TE>   "The barrier for rap music is starting to become much smaller,
there is access now to pop culture media that wasn't there before and
that has changed the art itself," Cohen said. "The controversial
becomes a different type of controversial....</TE>
<TE>   "Now all the gatekeepers that once said rap was vulgar and not
musical, their kids want Jay-Z's autograph and Ja Rule's autograph.
So now the gatekeepers give hip-hop access and the entrepreneurial
rappers are on the inside, not the outside.</TE>
<TE>   "Hip-hop has to figure out how to handle that. And I have no doubt
that it will."</TE>

<HD>Casting a Timeless Shadow</HD>
<DH>Steven Spielberg's 'Minority Report' is only the latest
film based on the work of sci-fi author Philip K. Dick</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL DESOWITZ</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It has been 20 years since the seminal sci-fi film "Blade Runner"
first burst on the scene with its cyberpunk prophecy of a dehumanized
21st century. The dark and dank depiction of L.A. as a technological
wonder and existential wasteland--part noir and part sci-fi--may owe
its aesthetic to director Ridley Scott, but its vision is that of the
late author Philip K. Dick.</LD>
<LD>   It was Dick who was responsible for the thrust of this much
imitated paranoid parable: What is reality? And what does it mean to
be human? It's no wonder, then, that Dick's fingerprints are all over
our science-fiction culture: "The X-Files," "The Matrix," "A.I.,"
"Eyes Wide Shut," "Vanilla Sky," "The Truman Show," "Waking Life,"
"Gattaca," "12 Monkeys" and the upcoming "Simone," about a
computer-generated actress, all have been influenced by Dick's
sensibility.</LD>
<TE>   And that's not counting the other adaptations of Dick's works:
"Total Recall" (Arnold Schwarzenegger goes to a travel agency for a
virtual vacation and leaves with a destructive memory implant),
"Screamers" (Peter Weller fights a war with a self-replicating
killing machine), "The Imposter" (Gary Sinise may or may not be an
android suicide bomber) and now "Minority Report," which opens
Friday. "Minority Report's" director Steven Spielberg and its star,
Tom Cruise, have fallen under Dick's spell with this yarn--loosely
based on a Dick short story that was adapted by screenwriters Scott
Frank and Jon Cohen--about a pre-crime unit in Washington, D.C., that
utilizes precognitive mutants to catch and convict murderers before
they commit their crimes. Cruise plays the hotshot cop that becomes
the pursued pursuer when the "Pre-Cogs" target him.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I tried to adapt [Dick] with 'Minority Report'--I
just took his brilliant premise and ran with it," offers Spielberg.
"The template sort of became self-determination versus destiny. And
that's what interested me the most: If there is something in the
stars, can you reconfigure them to either survive or write your own
ending?"</TE>
<TE>   Spielberg is well aware that the Dick zeitgeist has permeated the
sci-fi genre since "Blade Runner" and "Total Recall" (1992). Which is
why he purposely avoided referencing the two films again to avoid any
obvious comparisons, though he knows "Blade Runner" like the back of
his hand. "Where I thought 'Blade Runner' succeeded brilliantly was
in its style and its look. I thought Ridley did the most brilliant
job of his career with its lighting ... there really wasn't much of a
story to tell."</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't Dick's fault. If anything, there was too much story to
tell in the clever novel, "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep" that
served as the basis for "Blade Runner." The title alone is enough to
keep you up late at night trying to ponder its philosophical
connotations. Which is precisely what the always unsettling Dick had
in mind.</TE>
<TE>   Dick intentionally tried to get under readers' skins with his
mind-bending, Kafka-esque short stories and novels. Born in Chicago
in 1928, he lived most of his life in California and was a passionate
advocate of science fiction. Dick was addicted to amphetamines as a
result of depression he suffered in the '50s and often wrote under
the influence of the drugs. He died in 1982 of a stroke, just a few
months before the opening of "Blade Runner," the first film adapted
from his work.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to "Blade Runner," though, which became an instant cult
classic--Harrison Ford plays a desensitized bounty hunter who hunts
fugitive androids (known as replicants in the movie) that act more
human than humans--Dick was suddenly on the mainstream Hollywood map
where he has remained ever since. Currently there are at least two
other Dick adaptations in development, including "A Scanner Darkly,"
about drug addiction, with "Waking Life's" Richard Linklater
reportedly signed to write and direct.</TE>
<TE>   "Dick stands very high in the [science-fiction] pantheon," says
Brian Aldiss, a Dick admirer and author of the short story from which
"A.I." was based, "Super Toys Last Summer Long." "His early
fascination was that he provided a counterbalance to the triumphalism
of the Robert Heinlein kind of fiction. Phil talked about the bums
and derelicts of society. As one of the bums, I preferred him.</TE>
<TE>   "Dick is noir. He wrote about the early drug culture and the
paranoia gripping the world during the Cold War; those concerns have
proved enduring."</TE>
<TE>   According to Paul Williams, a rock journalist and close friend of
Dick's who interviewed him for Rolling Stone magazine in 1974, Dick
was an intense, disturbed yet sweet person with a great sense of
humor. "His goal was to pierce through the veil of what is only
apparently real and get at what is real," Williams says. "Because he
was more and more interested in exploring mystical experiences he had
early in 1974, he wrote more than a million words of notes
compulsively. It scared him. He actually thought he spoke to God."</TE>
<TE>   But in interviews, Dick discussed another profound impact in his
life: reading about the Jehovah's Witnesses who typed the list of
names marked for extermination in a Nazi death camp after they were
targeted too. Dick was struck by what he called the lists
"machine-like quality of pathology" and this interest in the process
of dehumanization defined his oeuvre.</TE>
<TE>   "He was definitely a post-modern thinker," says Paul Verhoeven,
who directed "Total Recall" and initially developed "Minority Report"
as a sequel before it eventually wound up with Cruise and Spielberg.
"He had this philosophy that there exists two realities, what we
dream and what we experience as reality, with no interpretation
favoring one or the other. This is what I chose to explore in 'Total
Recall,' the feeling that we cannot say what really is the truth."</TE>
<TE>   The trick with adapting Dick, suggests screenwriter Gary Goldman,
who collaborated on "Total Recall" and an early draft of "Minority
Report" with Verhoeven, is to be as subversive as possible, because
that's the essence of Dick. "The problem with making a Hollywood
movie is that it affirms existing ideals. But Dick's work ... is not
a morality tale."</TE>
<TE>   Spielberg made "Minority Report" more his own by focusing on the
personal and the political, with Cruise coming face to face with his
haunted past and the civil rights implications of his pre-crime
system. Yet coming on the heels of "A.I.," "Minority Report" is not
as much of a departure for the director as one would think, despite
its creepy undercurrent and visual bombardment.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the theme of parents losing children and obsessively
trying to reconnect with them is one of Spielberg's strongest
threads. "I've done that a lot, going all the way back to 'Sugarland
Express,' " he admits. "The whole idea of divorce and the
disenfranchisement of family is a huge fear of mine. It's also
something that makes me a better father and a better husband in my
own life because I can safeguard that from ever happening by being
more attentive to my family. That's the dye in me that doesn't wash
off."</TE>
<TE>   The film's strange, gritty look, an homage to film noir, however,
represents another stylistic breakthrough for Spielberg. "Rather than
going for a black-and-white look, which I did in ['Saving Private]
Ryan,' I used a 'bleach bypass' process, which takes all the color
out of the face, because people with rosy cheeks and good complexions
tend to undermine the tone of the scene they're in, forcing
filmmakers to use blue and green light, which we hate to do. So the
process gave me that sort of forsaken and barren look, which I really
wanted for this story and had never done in a movie."</TE>
<TE>   "But the template that I used for this movie more than anything
else was 'The French Connection.' Very simply, I loved the way Billy
[director William Friedkin] made the most New York film anybody's
ever made, in my opinion, and then threw away New York. It's just
environment. And because I was making this story on the future with
these toys, I wanted to spend a lot of money on the toys and then
throw them away. I wanted to use the film as a philosophical jumping
off point to embrace the future for a second, establish the world and
then throw it away and tell the story."</TE>
<TE>   Spielberg found something even more personal in "Minority Report"
that reverberates throughout Dick's work--the fear of losing control:
"The big thing that really sparked me was that if I could know what
would really happen tomorrow, would I want to find out? I went to an
astrologist when I was just a kid at Universal, when I had my first
office and my first secretary. It was around 1969. I foolishly gave
her my birth date and all the other information she needed to do a
five-year chart. And everything came true.</TE>
<TE>   "I vowed at the end of that I would never, ever want to know again
what was just around the corner. Ever. Of course, I fear that and the
more I fear something, the more I'm attracted to it."</TE>

<HD>ABC Confirms Stephanopoulos Gets 'This Week'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>ABC made official Tuesday perhaps the worst-kept secret in the
television business, naming George Stephanopoulos to anchor its
Sunday-morning newsmaker show, "This Week." He starts in September,
replacing Cokie Roberts and Sam Donaldson, who will take on other
assignments at the network.</LD>
<LD>   With the appointment of the former staffer for President Bill
Clinton, ABC returns to a single-anchor format that it hopes can help
the show better take on NBC's "Meet the Press" juggernaut, where Tim
Russert holds a commanding lead in the ratings.</LD>
<LD>   This season, "Meet the Press" has been drawing an average of 4.68
million viewers a week, while ABC and CBS' "Face the Nation" battle
for distant second, ABC averaging 3.2 million viewers and CBS 3.05
million, according to Nielsen Media Research figures.</LD>
<TE>   Stephanopoulos, 41, was senior advisor to the president for policy
and strategy in the Clinton White House, and played a major role in
both Clinton campaigns for the presidency. He joined ABC News five
years ago as a news analyst on "This Week" before attempting to shed
his partisan political cloak and transform himself into a reporter
and anchor.</TE>
<TE>   ABC has sent him on a flurry of overseas assignments, including
the Middle East, Cuba and South Africa just this year, and he's
filled in as a "Good Morning America" anchor as well as at "This
Week."</TE>
<TE>   Stephanopoulos said he and the show's new executive producer, Jon
Banner, will take the summer to figure out the show's new look, but
will keep "a good, tough, challenging newsmaker interview and a vivid
round table" debate as part of the format. The show may travel more,
to explore international and domestic stories, as a way to
distinguish itself.</TE>
<TE>   Banner had been the senior producer for ABC's "World News
Tonight."</TE>
<TE>   The summer will also be a time for meetings with politicians on
both sides of the fence. Stephanopoulos said he hopes grumbling that
his political past doesn't make him objective enough for the job
won't be an issue. "I think it's something that's going to work
itself out over time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts, who had told management she wanted to scale back her
duties, will remain a political analyst for ABC. Donaldson will
report and substitute anchor for "Nightline," and will report for
ABC's prime-time newsmagazines, in addition to continuing his radio
and Internet duties.</TE>

<HD>ABC's 'State v.' Looks Inside Five Murder Trials</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Public defender Jerry Hernandez pondered the dozens of potential
jurors queried earlier in the day in the matter of State v. Santos,
the trial of a 25-year-old tow truck driver charged with
second-degree murder.</LD>
<LD>   Hernandez got a "good vibe" from the graying Air Force nurse, and
he liked the Boeing engineer with the Wilford Brimley look, but not
that woman with the cold stare, the one whose cousin was murdered
years ago. Hernandez wanted a blue-collar jury; he feared Ivy League
types who might scrunch their noses at his "dirt bag" client and
think, "I can't relate to him. I never saw him at any of the
Vanderbilts' tea parties."</LD>
<LD>   When the jury began deliberating days later, Hernandez's hunches
proved to be almost uncanny--but would they be enough to keep his
client out of prison for the next 22 years?</LD>
<TE>   From jury selection through the often-contentious deliberations,
ABC's new five-part documentary series "State v." offers a
suspenseful look at the criminal justice system. The crisply edited,
one-hour show premieres tonight with the Santos trial, and each
weekly episode chronicles a different case.</TE>
<TE>   A special order from the Arizona Supreme Court made this real-life
"Law &amp; Order" possible, allowing network news crews to track five
homicide cases over 18 months with unfettered access to legal
strategy sessions, judicial chambers and jury rooms as well as
courtrooms. Legal correspondent Cynthia McFadden narrates.</TE>
<TE>   In August 2000, Santos put two bullets into the head of his friend
and roommate, Tommy. Smooth, veteran prosecutor John Ditsworth saw
the case as a typical "falling out among thieves." Santos and Tommy
were stealing from the windshield repair shop where they both worked.
After Tommy fingered Santos, the defendant vowed revenge and took it.</TE>
<TE>   Santos claimed self-defense, asserting that Tommy, who was high on
speed, pulled a gun on him first. As Santos explained out of the
jury's earshot, "It was either him or me, and it wasn't going to be
me."</TE>
<TE>   The case may sound mundane, but the presentation and personalities
are far from it. While Ditsworth proceeded with cool efficiency,
Hernandez worked night and day, nearly cracking under the stress of
his third homicide case.</TE>
<TE>   On the eve of the trial, he rehearsed his opening at home in front
of a buddy and his bemused dog: "Rudy Santos shot Tommy Hutchinson.
Rudy Santos did not murder Tommy Hutchinson." Hernandez also prepared
using a "backyard jury" of his friends and neighbors to spot holes in
his defense. He knew his client was not "the sharpest knife in the
cabinet," but he also knew that Santos' freedom would hinge on his
testimony, so Hernandez and a colleague prepped him mercilessly.</TE>
<TE>   When the case went to the jury, a verdict appeared imminent at the
end of the first day of deliberations. But in a twist out of the film
classic "Twelve Angry Men," the foreman finally spoke up, tempers
flared and some jurors eventually rethought their positions.</TE>
<TE>   A documentary should be as involving as it is enlightening, and in
the case of "State v.," legal drama doesn't get much better. Who
knows: After watching these dedicated pros and ordinary citizens in
action, some viewers might even look forward to jury duty.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "State v." premieres at 10 tonight on ABC.</TE>

<HD>They're Out Stalking Heads</HD>
<DH>Competition for booking guests is fierce as Chung and
Donahue enter the fray</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Phil Donahue has put out the word that he wants former President Bill
Clinton as a guest when his MSNBC show launches July 15, while Connie
Chung is crowing about an interview that she promises "will make
news" her very first night on the air at CNN on Monday. She's
pre-taped it, just to make sure her quarry doesn't get away.</LD>
<LD>   Move over, Larry King, and make way, Barbara Walters, Diane
Sawyer, Katie Couric and Mike Wallace. Some not-so-new kids in town
are going after "the get," as the big newsmaking interviews are
called, in a very aggressive way.</LD>
<LD>   The booking wars promise to get real dirty, real quick, rivaling
the last-minute guest-snatching that routinely takes place among the
morning news shows and during the most competitive days at ABC News'
newsmagazines.</LD>
<TE>   Chung's temporary CNN office is a chaotic jumble of unpacked boxes
with labels such as "[son] Matthew's Winnie the Pooh Growth Chart"
and a prominently displayed cooking apron that proclaims "I Grilled
Condit." But her files are in pristine order, some 300 of them
sitting in three neat rows on the window ledge, each containing vital
contact numbers for an interview Chung hopes to land. She won't let a
reporter interviewing her get close enough to read the names at the
top, paranoid about keeping her subjects "under the radar" until the
show launches. She says she has lured one interview from the networks
and "I'm licking my chops."</TE>
<TE>   Chung, of course, has experience getting the get. Before she left
ABC for CNN, she bested colleagues Walters and Sawyer, as well as
then-rival King, for last summer's prize catch of U.S. Rep. Gary
Condit (R-Ceres), probing his relationship with intern Chandra Levy
for "PrimeTime Thursday." It didn't win her brownie points with her
ABC colleagues, but about 23.7 million people tuned in.</TE>
<TE>   But now she's on cable, where King's top-rated 2002 show so
far--interviewing the lawyers representing actor Robert Blake and his
murdered wife--averaged just 2.6 million viewers.</TE>
<TE>   What the cable networks can do, however, is replay interviews as
many as 50 times in one day, which can balance out the broader
one-time reach of a network interview, and CNN is often seen as a
valuable way for heads of state and policymakers to reach an
international audience, say those who control access to some guests.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, some big players shy away from CNN, Fox and MSNBC.</TE>
<TE>   "It is more difficult to get into [cable] as much," says an
official at the White House, where only about 30 of each week's 300
or so TV requests are fulfilled. "If you do one, you have to do them
all and it's physically impossible. If Colin Powell were to do all
the cable shows, he'd do nothing but cable shows."</TE>
<TE>   That won't stop cable players from jumping into the fray. In early
June, six weeks before Donahue's show launches, interview bookers
from the program were already hitting the phones and e-mail in hot
pursuit of a trifecta: an interview with Dan Rather, Peter Jennings
and Tom Brokaw, all in the same studio at the same time to talk with
Donahue about news anchor "war stories from behind the desk."</TE>
<TE>   Despite promises from his staff that Donahue's show "will have
real conversations--the kind of conversations that change ideas and
lives," that particular interview lineup so far seems unlikely to
take place, network sources say.</TE>
<TE>   King is tireless, say the objects of his pursuit, playing on his
longtime friendships and picking up the phone himself, where some of
his colleagues let their staffs do most of the work. His guest list
reflects it, ranging recently from Bush administration officials to
buxom model Anna Nicole Smith, who turned to King to talk exclusively
about her court fight over her dead husband's estate.</TE>
<TE>   The little secret of cable, however, is that the biggest name
doesn't mean the most viewers. King's Top 10 most-watched list since
the beginning of 2002 includes child poet Mattie Stepanek, Rather,
CBS commentator Andy Rooney, self-help guru Dr. Phil McGraw and
"America's Most Wanted" host John Walsh--who figures on the list
twice. Chung herself, interviewed when she joined CNN, made the list
at No. 10.</TE>
<TE>   There are only about 10 names at the moment--including first lady
Laura Bush and former Vice President Al Gore--who can really capture
a major audience, says Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly, whose show
will air head-to-head with Chung's and Donahue's on weekdays at 5
p.m. O'Reilly, whose show thrives more on his personality than on
guest bookings, nonetheless plans to counter with a couple big names
of his own on Monday, but he's not saying who.</TE>
<TE>   Standing in a back corner, leaning against the wood paneling at
Monday's Chung launch party at New York's 21 Club, O'Reilly repays
the hospitality by saying he has a welcoming counterpunch ready for
Chung and will have one for Donahue, as well.</TE>
<TE>   "I am worried," he insists, even though his audience is the
largest among all three cable news channels and his combative style
doesn't have much in common with Chung's. But, he says, "If I slip
two-tenths of a rating point, that's bad." So he says he'll do what
he has always done with his competition: Log their every move and
scrutinize the 15-minute ratings blocks every day, then adjust
accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   King, whose show will follow Chung's, has his own welcome gift for
his new colleague: On her first night, he's booked an exclusive
interview with the parents of Daniel Pearl, giving their first
interview since the Wall Street Journal reporter was kidnapped and
executed in Pakistan. Other guests next week include none other than
ratings-getter Walsh.</TE>
<TE>   Gearing up for battle, some employees of Chung's show say flatly
that their biggest competition is internal; King's staff is ruthless
about insisting they won't have on any guests who appear on other CNN
shows. CNN insiders are still buzzing about King's snippy questioning
of Chung when he had her as a guest right after she signed with the
network in January, working in practically every controversial
interview she has done, down to ice skater Tonya Harding, and
throwing this zinger: "Did you feel shunted around at all at ABC,
which has such prominent women in journalism? Did you feel like
third-rung?"</TE>
<TE>   At Chung's launch party, however, King was nothing but gracious,
posing for pictures and recounting how one of his ex-wives used to
work on a Chung-anchored newsmagazine at NBC.</TE>
<TE>   King and Chung will often be going after different prey, in any
case, with Chung playing off the news of the day and tracking more of
the ordinary players caught up in extraordinary circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   CNN executives are practically giddy about the possibility of
having to mediate booking fights between the two. "This is a goldmine
for CNN. We should have this problem," says Teya Ryan, CNN's
executive vice president and general manager.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly didn't hurt ABC," she says, referring to the intense
guest chase among Sawyer, Walters and Chung, when she was there. "At
the end of the day, CNN is going to get the interview, no matter
what."</TE>
<TE>   Chung herself spoofed the whole process of chasing the interviews
at her party, singing off-key, to the tune of "Get Me to the Church
on Time," such humdingers as "That's right, Osama, come talk to
Mama." Her lyrics perhaps revealed whom she's chasing, hinting she'd
be happy with former and current first daughters Chelsea Clinton and
twins Barbara and Jenna Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Chung continues to chase some interviews that she'd been pursuing
at ABC, and she says some subjects have told her that "even though
you changed banks, your money is still good." Others she lost,
however, one because the subject had a book to promote and wanted the
broad reach of NBC's "Today" and "Oprah."</TE>
<TE>   Chung says her former newsmagazine homes have "all gone a little
tabloid, a little sensational," and CNN's reputation for straight
news will give her an advantage. One senior network newsmagazine
executive sniffs back that CNN "isn't even on the same playing
field."</TE>
<TE>   Chung tried to bring two of her top ABC producers with her to CNN
but was rebuffed. Both ended up with nice promotions at ABC. Chung
fared better internally at CNN, securing a booker from King and a
well-regarded political producer from Washington.</TE>

<HD>It's One Enchanted Evening</HD>
<DH>The motion picture academy pays tribute to Richard Rodgers,
a composer who won an Oscar but preferred working on Broadway</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard Rodgers is best known as one of the most successful--if not
the most successful--Broadway musical composer of the 20th century.
But he also wrote some of his greatest standards for the movies. With
his first collaborator, lyricist Lorenz Hart, he penned the tunes
"The Blue Room" and "Manhattan" for an all-but-forgotten 1929 musical
short, "The Makers of Melody," and "Isn't It Romantic" for the 1932
feature, "Love Me Tonight."</LD>
<LD>   And with his second collaborator, Oscar Hammerstein II, he won an
Oscar for best song for "It Might as Well Be Spring" from the 1945
movie musical, "State Fair." That Technicolor classic also features
the standard, "A Grand Night for Singing."</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday night, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences
will pay tribute to Rodgers' contribution to film at the Samuel
Goldwyn Theatre with a "Centennial Tribute to Richard Rodgers." Julie
Andrews, who starred in the 1965 Oscar-winning adaptation of Rodgers
&amp; Hammerstein's "The Sound of Music," as well as the team's 1957 TV
musical of "Cinderella," will be the host for the evening that will
include live musical performances from Oscar winners Joel Grey and
Kathy Bates, along with Tony Danza and Andrea Marcovicci.</LD>
<TE>   "The body of his work is just stunning," said Andrews of Rodgers,
who would have celebrated his 100th birthday this month. "It is the
standard to a great extent to which other musicals are judged. 'You
can turn anywhere and find a Rodgers song. What is more important
than ever is that these beautiful things must not fade away."</TE>
<TE>   Academy governor Samuel Goldwyn Jr. is producing the evening with
Oscar-winning composer Alan Bergman. The pair produced a similar
event about Irving Berlin a few years ago at the academy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very important, from an academy point of view, for people
and particularly members of this industry to show this tradition of
musicals and that these great composers all wrote for movies and did
some of their best work for films," says Goldwyn. "I hope that some
day the movie musical in the form of today's music will come back."</TE>
<TE>   Among the clips to be featured in the program is "Slaughter on
10th Avenue" from 1948's "Worlds and Music," "Ten Cents a Dance" from
1955's "Love Me or Leave Me," "There's Nothin' Like a Dame" from the
1958 film version of "South Pacific," "Shall We Dance" from the 1956
film adaptation of "The King and I," "Oh What a Beautiful Morning"
from the 1955 film version of "Oklahoma!" and "Do, Re Me" from "The
Sound of Music."</TE>
<TE>   Goldwyn and Bergman started working on the tribute last summer.
"It's wonderful working with Alan because he has such a musical
knowledge," said Goldwyn. "It's really exciting to watch these films.
The number of personalties that sang the songs--Lena Horne, Frank
Sinatra.... Al Jolson did "Hallelujah, I'm a Bum.' "</TE>
<TE>   Bates, who sang in the 1998 ABC-TV version of the musical "Annie,"
will be performing Rodgers and Hart's 'Where or When" and "Mountain
Greenery" with Grey. "Years ago, I used to be a singing waitress in
the Catskills," she says. "We actually did a melody of Rodgers and
Hart songs back then."</TE>
<TE>   The actress is looking forward to the tribute because she wants to
learn more about Rodgers, who died in 1979. "It will be an eye-opener
for me to watch the whole program. When I was singing this stuff,
when I as much younger, I didn't know much about him then."</TE>
<TE>   Grey will be performing the comic number "Honey Bun" from "South
Pacific." A longtime fan of Rodgers and a good friend of his
composer-daughter, Mary, Grey first met Richard Rodgers back in 1959
at an ill-fated audition.</TE>
<TE>   "I am ashamed to tell you it was for the young boy in 'The Sound
of Music'--Rolfe," says Grey, breaking into Rolfe's song, "I Am 16
Going On 17." "When you are hungry you go up for everything," he
says, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   Andrews first met Rodgers and Hammerstein early in her Broadway
career when she auditioned for one of their lesser-known musicals,
"Pipe Dream." A few years later, she worked with them on
"Cinderella." "I actually in all honesty remember Hammerstein a bit
more," she says. "Rodgers wasn't as present as Hammerstein was, but
obviously they were both giants of the American theater. I am annoyed
with myself that when I had the opportunity I didn't sit in awe at
their feet and listen and ask questions."</TE>
<TE>   Though Rodgers wrote two new songs for the film version of "The
Sound of Music"--"I Have Confidence" and "Something Good"-- he never
visited the set. "When the new songs came in his presence was there
... but it was amazing that he didn't come out."</TE>
<TE>   Goldwyn Jr. was just a youngster when Rodgers and his wife would
visit his father, the noted producer, and his mother, at their house
in Hollywood. "He said something I have never forgotten. He was
talking about working with director Josh Logan and he was saying one
of the things about being successful is that it is wonderful that you
can work with such good people."</TE>
<TE>   But like his contemporaries George and Ira Gershwin, Irving Berlin
and Cole Porter, Rodgers felt more at home on Broadway than in
Hollywood. "They were New Yorkers," says Goldwyn. "The theater was
their medium."</TE>
<TE>   The clips and performances will also illustrate the dual nature of
Rodgers' composing career. "There was a Richard Rodgers who wrote
with Lorenz Hart where he wrote the music and Hart wrote the lyrics,"
says Goldwyn. "Then there is a Richard Rodgers who wrote with Oscar
Hammerstein where Oscar Hammerstein wrote the lyrics and then Rodgers
wrote the music. It's very interesting. One is that style of hip
Manhattan of the 1930s and early '40s and the other is this enormous
optimism of life, which is the Hammerstein lyric. But the tunes in
some respect are very similar if you eliminate the lyrics from them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Centennial Tribute to Richard Rodgers," takes place Thursday at 8
p.m. at the Samuel Goldwyn Theatre, 8949 Wilshire Blvd. Beverly
Hills. The evening is sold out but there will be a cancellation line.

<LD>   ABC Series: A Thorn in Network's Side</LD>
<LD>   Just when you thought it couldn't get worse: ABC executives,
pummeled for their dismal showing in prime time last season, are now
taking flak for a program they'd already canceled.</LD>
<TE>   The latest nail in the coffin for the comedy "My Adventures in
Television" not only provoked an apology from one of its stars but
also caused Kodak to withdraw additional advertising for the duration
of the show's run.</TE>
<TE>   The series' June 5 installment provoked criticism from some
viewers for its handling of a story about a woman embarking on a
Chinese adoption--a responsibility she soon comes to regret. "If you
break her, you bought her," she tells a friend holding the child.
"You can get a prettier baby if you offer blue jeans as a bribe,"
someone jokes.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to what he said were hundreds of e-mails, actor Ed
Begley Jr. apologized to the senders. "It was our intention to show
how shallow the character Lindsay was," he said, "not to cast the
slightest negative image on babies or the heroes and heroines who
adopt them."</TE>
<TE>   An ABC spokesman said "it was never the producer's intent for this
character to be emulated or for the series to be perceived as
anything other than a farce on the absurdity of Hollywood." Executive
producer Peter Tolan advised people to "get a sense of humor"--and to
take comfort in the fact that the sitcom will be gone in a few more
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Victoria's Secret Gets Return Engagement</TE>
<TE>   CBS is planning to air a Victoria's Secret fashion show during the
key ratings month of November, despite the controversy that erupted
when ABC broadcast a similar program last season. As before, the show
will feature women in sexy lingerie and skimpy undergarments.</TE>
<TE>   Though CBS executives declined to comment Tuesday, insiders said
the network hooked up with the lingerie company after ABC passed on
the project.</TE>
<TE>   The ABC program prompted dozens of complaints from viewers and
feminist groups and sparked an investigation by a member of the
Federal Communications Commission about violation of decency
standards.</TE>
<TE>   "Victoria's Secret Fashion Show" was a hit with viewers,
however--especially males.</TE>
<TE>   THE ARTS</TE>
<TE>   Former Opera Executive to Head Lincoln Center</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Crawford, former president and general manager of the
Metropolitan Opera, was named chairman of Lincoln Center at the
board's annual meeting Monday, taking over the post Beverly Sills
occupied for eight years.</TE>
<TE>   Crawford, 73, chairman of Omnicom, an advertising conglomerate,
will have his hands full. In addition to overseeing institutions such
as the New York City Ballet and the Metropolitan Opera, he'll be
responsible for the center's contentious $1.2-billion redevelopment
plan. The job is so complex, the New York Times reports, that the
board had considered appointing co-chairmen--a notion Crawford
rejected.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge job in terms of strategy and planning and raising a
great deal of money," he said. "And there is the whole question of
getting constituents to march in the same direction. There's a lot to
do. But it's difficult to do with more than one leader."</TE>
<TE>   THEATER</TE>
<TE>   Kudos for Drabinsky's Return to the Stage</TE>
<TE>   Producer Garth Drabinsky ("Ragtime," "Show Boat") has been absent
from the theater scene ever since the U.S. Attorney's Office indicted
him and a partner, Myron I. Gottlieb, on six counts of fraud and
conspiracy in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   But according to the Toronto Star, he was on hand Sunday night to
accept two awards for his first foray back: "The Island," a prison
drama by South African playwright Athol Fugard that he imported to
Canada with Xhosa Theatrical Productions.</TE>
<TE>   "Four years ago, in an unceremonious way, I was stripped of every
award I ever received in theater," he said, accepting the prize for
outstanding production at the Dora Mavor Moore Awards at Toronto's
Princess of Wales Theatre. "Three of these awards were Dora Mavor
Moore Awards. This now belongs back where it will be looked at
probably every day."</TE>
<TE>   Though he's unable to set foot in the United States, the Canadian
impresario is reportedly involved in a Broadway revival of "The
Dresser," the 1980 London backstage drama, which--after a Toronto
run--is expected to arrive in New York next spring.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Universal Pictures has bought the rights to Richard Alfieri's "Six
Dance Lessons in Six Weeks," the story of a retiree and her hired
dance instructor that had its world premiere at the Geffen Playhouse
last year and is headed for Broadway next season. Arthur Seidelman,
who directed those productions, will direct the film; Alfieri will
write the screenplay.... Vicente Fernandez will be honored as the
2002 Latin Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences person of the year on
Sept. 17 in L.A.... Britney Spears has signed a deal with NASCAR to
star in an untitled film set in the world of stock-car racing. The
first picture by Spears' production company, it will be written by
James V. Hart (Francis Ford Coppola's "Dracula").... Veteran
broadcast journalist Bill Moyers will receive the first Kieser Award
at the Humanitas Prize luncheon in L.A. on June 25. The award is
named for the late priest and producer Ellwood "Bud" Kieser, who
founded the Humanitas honors, given to TV and movie writers whose
work has promoted human dignity.</TE>

<HD>Hollywood Bets On Beautiful Minds</HD>
<DH>Movies* 'Windtalkers' follows in the footsteps of 'Enigma'
and last year's best picture Oscar winner: feature films that depict
the art of code breaking.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD NATALE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Recently movies have been talking in code--or code breaking anyway.
Three films have dealt with the use of codes in disseminating
military intelligence, most recently "Windtalkers," John Woo's epic
World War II saga, which has as its foundation the use of the Navajo
language as a strategic code in the Pacific theater. It was preceded
by another WWII real-life tale, "Enigma," about the cracking of an
encoding machine used by the Germans in their troop movements.</LD>
<LD>   And in last year's Oscar winner, "A Beautiful Mind," John Nash is
recruited to bring his mathematical genius to bear on breaking codes
during the Cold War era--which becomes a vehicle for delineating his
descent into paranoid schizophrenia.</LD>
<LD>   The Enigma coding device was, in its day, relatively sophisticated
in comparison to the decidedly low-tech use of the Navajo language.
Yet the former encryption device was cracked by the Allies, while the
latter was never deciphered by the Japanese. For "Enigma" director
Michael Apted, all three movies thematically point to a period in
time when military intelligence communication was taken more
seriously.</LD>
<TE>   "If we hadn't been able to read intelligence, we would never have
won the second world war," Apted says. "But for some reason, in the
past 10 or 15 years it's all gone out of whack and we've lost
essential information."</TE>
<TE>   The World War II-era codes were derived from the most unlikely
sources: The Enigma machine was an adaptation of a mathematical
device created in the '20s for use by financial institutions; the
Navajo code was another variation on the use of Native American
languages. According to Jack Ingram, curator of the National
Cryptographic Museum, the U.S. had successfully used Choctaw encoded
messages in World War I.</TE>
<TE>   Just as the codes were derived from unlikely sources, so too were
the men and women involved in their creation and interception, Apted
points out. In its effort to break the Enigma code, the British
ministry of defense recruited code breakers through unconventional
means including crossword puzzle competitions and chess matches. He
calls them the progenitors of today's computer nerds. "But that
didn't stop the British. They really saw the importance of being
non-elitist in their attempt to find good minds for solving puzzles,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the Enigma decoders were teenagers. Similarly, of the 420
Navajo trained by the Marines to be "windtalkers," a large number
were recruited right out of high school, including Merrill Sandoval,
a Navajo Indian who was approached by Marines who visited his school
in New Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Only after he'd enlisted (at age 17) and gone through basic
training did he learn the real reason why they were interested in
him.</TE>
<TE>   "We were quartered separately from the beginning," recalls the
77-year-old veteran who now lives in Arizona. "We never asked why.
But after boot camp we were sent to Camp Pendleton where they started
training us in all phases of communication."</TE>
<TE>   That included memorizing a 20-page Navajo "code" dictionary,
according to Ingram, the first time the Navajo language had been
written down. In the lexicon, jointly developed by the Marines and
the Navajo enlisted men, the language was adapted for military
purposes. Ships were referred to using Navajo words for different
fishes. Similarly, aircraft were named after various birds, according
to Sandoval, who spent his war years stationed at headquarters
communicating with other Navajo on board aircraft and vessels and on
the front line. "It was completely oral. Even our own people only
knew that we were talking Navajo. But they didn't know what we were
saying."</TE>
<TE>   Since nothing was ever written down and the Navajo servicemen had
committed the code to memory, it was rendered unbreakable. To the
Japanese, it sounded like little more than gibberish. "They did
everything to jam us and they even had people who spoke excellent
English issuing conflicting orders," says Sandoval, "but we managed
to get our messages through."</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, no Navajo serviceman was ever captured by the
Japanese.</TE>
<TE>   The interception of an Enigma machine by the Poles early in the
war became the first step in breaking that code, through a British
and American team effort, according to Ingram. One of the Germans'
original three-rotor, disc-playing devices fell into enemy hands.
After taking it apart, a logic to the scrambling of letters and
numbers was eventually devised. The U.S. then unscrambled a
next-generation four-rotor machine.</TE>
<TE>   One of the reasons Nash may have been recruited by the Rand Corp.
in the years following World War II was to bring his mathematical
gift for the abstraction to bear on reading codes, according to Dave
Bayer, a professor of mathematics at Barnard College who served as a
consultant on "A Beautiful Mind." Code breaking had previously been
primarily a linguistic exercise, explains Ingram. But since the '20s,
intelligence sources had begun to avail themselves of mathematicians'
abilities to decipher sequencing patterns.</TE>
<TE>   "The way it's used in ["A Beautiful Mind"] is more on a
psychological level," Bayer says. "When Nash looks at codes he is
trying to find order in chaos. Human beings have been looking for
patterns in disorder since we lived in trees. To that extent we're
all mathematicians."</TE>
<TE>   As an example, Bayer mentions the Morse code. What if, in addition
to the familiar series of dots and dashes, subtle variations were
added, he asks. "What if the message was not in the transcription of
the actual code but in the timing of the transmission? In that way,
codes are like magic. The minute you start looking for one thing, it
can be varied. And if you ignore that addition, it can't be
deciphered. To break codes it would be useful to study magic.
Magicians are masters at redirection. They can get you to look
elsewhere."</TE>
<TE>   In "A Beautiful Mind," Nash's fascination with codes becomes a
metaphor for his mental disintegration as he begins searching for
hidden codes in places like consumer magazines. But that idea in and
of itself was not necessarily absurd, according to Bayer. "It was a
way of showing that he'd gone over the edge and was looking for
things that weren't there. But if you think about it, looking for
[coding] in magazines is not that different than looking for visual
messages on Web pages, which [there is speculation] are being used to
send signals after Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   Because of technological advances, breaking new codes has become
"one of the great challenges," Ingram says. But even with the most
sophisticated computers, he adds, the one continuum is the human
factor. "Theory and mathematics might be foolproof. But it's always
humans who use them."</TE>

<HD>An Art Park Is the Answer, Not a Gym</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is a quintessential urban conflict: An art community looks to
stake out new territory in an ethnic enclave, while local activists
strive to counter an invasion from unwanted outsiders.</LD>
<LD>   This time, the controversy centers on a small plot of land in the
shadow of the Museum of Contemporary Art's Geffen Contemporary in
Little Tokyo. MOCA and its allies hope to transform the barren, 3
1/2-acre lot into a public "Art Park"--an open green space that will
anchor a cluster of downtown cultural institutions that already
includes the Japanese American National Museum and the East West
Players theater, as well as the Geffen. Neighborhood activists, on
the other hand, see the city-owned site as a perfect spot for a
gymnasium that would function as a home for the local Japanese
basketball league.</LD>
<LD>   The two sides will air their differences at a public meeting
scheduled for Thursday at the Japanese American National Museum, when
city officials hope to settle the dispute and move on to the next
phase of the site's development.</LD>
<TE>   But appeasing angry constituents is one thing. Creating a livable
environment is something else. And from an urban-planning standpoint,
this is a no-brainer. The Art Park proposal would do what all good
urban plans should do: Strengthen the communal fabric of downtown and
provide a tranquil public space that would serve a range of ethnic
and cultural groups. The gym proposal, by comparison, would be more
of an urban disaster--the kind of big-box space that would dwarf its
surrounding context.</TE>
<TE>   The conflict is less the result of a clash of opposing visions
than of bureaucratic bumbling and the sore feelings that subsequently
resulted. In the mid-1980s, the Japanese American community was first
promised a new gym as part of the newly constructed Japanese American
Cultural and Community Center complex at San Pedro between 2nd and
3rd streets. But sculptor Isamu Noguchi, who was then designing a
public artwork for the complex, argued that the site would function
better as a plaza for his work, and the notion of building a gym
there was dropped.</TE>
<TE>   A decade later, community leaders tried again. This time, a
coalition led by Bill Watanabe, director of the Little Tokyo Service
Center, approached then-City Councilwoman Rita Walters, whose
district included Little Tokyo, about building the gym alongside the
Geffen Contemporary. That idea was rebuffed because Walters
envisioned the creation of a park at the site. (Former MOCA director
Richard Koshalek came up with the Art Park idea several years later.)</TE>
<TE>   Over the next couple of years, the group looked at a number of
other potential sites, but with little financial backing, they were
almost inevitably outbid by developers with deeper pockets. (The
group has raised about $1 million in federal and state grants, but it
has yet to raise the additional $6 million to $7 million that would
be needed to build the gym.)</TE>
<TE>   It was only in the past year, after decades of fruitless
negotiations with the city and various developers, that the group
turned its attention back to the proposed Art Park site. The location
had two basic advantages: It stands in the heart of Little Tokyo,
and, because it is a city-owned property, it would cost $1 a year to
lease.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the Art Park, however, it had no real relationship to its
immediate surroundings. Since 1983, when the Geffen Contemporary
opened, the museum building has sparked a small but important
cultural renaissance in downtown L.A. The East West Players
organization moved to its current theater just to the south of the
Geffen in 1998. The Japanese American National Museum opened next
door a year later. And last year, the city approved a plan to build a
new Children's Museum building at the corner of Judge John Aiso and
Temple streets, framing the park site's northern edge.</TE>
<TE>   The result has been the largely spontaneous growth of a
loose-knit, creative enclave, one whose various institutions reflect
a particularly rich cultural matrix.</TE>
<TE>   The Art Park would be the final piece in that puzzle. In effect,
it would weave these disparate organizations into a cohesive whole.
Just as important, it would act as a social condenser, a public
gathering place that could be shared by a range of communities, from
local residents to museum-goers. That this would occur in an area of
the city desperately in need of green space is a yet another plus.</TE>
<TE>   MOCA and the Japanese American National Museum have received a
block grant to develop a master plan for the Art Park. If the
proposal is approved, they hope to pay for it with public and private
funds. The cost of the project is estimated at about $7 million.</TE>
<TE>   Designed by Los Angeles-based Michael Maltzan Architecture, the
park would rest on top of two levels of partially underground
parking. Visitors would enter the lawn from the north, at ground
level. From there, the park's form would sweep up to a height of 16
feet, like an enormous grass carpet, its surface scattered with
trees.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is to create an urban amphitheater that allows visitors
to retreat from the city and to engage it more directly. From the
park's highest point, visitors would have sweeping views of the
downtown skyline. Further below, its grassy lawn would provide a
refuge from the hard-edged city around it.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, lifting the park partially off the ground sets up a
number of potentially intriguing urban experiences along its edges.
To the east, a broad pedestrian boulevard would run from 1st Street
to the back of the site at Temple, linking the various museum
entries. To the south, a restaurant would be tucked underneath one
corner of the park, creating a small outdoor plaza at the back of the
East West Players theater. To the north, the park would form a front
yard for the Children's Museum.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, the proposed 44,000-square-foot gym, designed by
Gruen Associates, would swallow up most of the remaining public space
around the site. The back side of the building, meanwhile, would loom
over the entry canopy of the Geffen Contemporary, creating a cramped,
awkward pathway to the museum and virtually cutting it off from the
site of the future Children's Museum.</TE>
<TE>   The real issue, therefore, is not which is the better proposal,
but whether city officials are willing to take the lead in working
out a plan that would save the Art Park without trampling on the
feelings of gym supporters. That would mean actively searching for an
alternate gym site and shepherding both projects through to their
conclusion, rather than offering more empty promises. It would also
require a broader, more enlightened view of urban planning, thinking
about the city as a complex urban organism--one made up of distinct
but interrelated parts--rather than a series of unrelated development
schemes.</TE>
<TE>   With Walters no longer on the board, that task will now fall to
City Councilwoman Jan Perry. Perry has yet to publicly take a
position on either plan. But the public meeting should offer a window
into how she plans to attack such development issues in the future.
Is she committed to creating a better urban environment for her
constituents? Or can they expect more political posturing?</TE>
<TE>   Either way, the answer is not to make the Art Park a dumping
ground. That is not how to build a better city.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the park should be seen as a rare opportunity to create
the kind of environment that could serve as a bridge between the
city's famously isolated communities. And that should be every
politician's dream.</TE>

<LD>The NBA championship game limped out a winner. The Lakers' threepeat
clincher against the Nets last Wednesday was the most-watched TV
program of the week, with an average audience of 16.56 million
people, but that was 17% lower than Game 4 drew last year, according
to Nielsen Media Research figures released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Overall, in fact, ratings for the entire Los Angeles-New Jersey
series on NBC were down by 17% from last year, doubtless a reflection
of this year's one-sided matchup. The event moves to ABC next year.</LD>
<LD>   NBC won the weekly competition among the networks for the seventh
week in a row, thanks to the performance of the basketball game, the
"Dateline NBC" franchise and strong showings Sunday for a repeat of
"Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent" and the premiere of "Crime &amp;
Punishment," another offering from producer Dick Wolf.</LD>
<TE>   Also premiering strongly last week was the Fox unscripted summer
series "American Idol: The Search for a Superstar." Its first
telecast on Tuesday attracted 9.85 million viewers; the second
showing one night later jumped to 11.24 million to finish among the
week's Top 10.</TE>

<TE>   Here are the rankings for national prime-time network television
last week (June 10-16) as compiled by Nielsen Media Research. They
are based on the average number of people who watched a program from
start to finish. Nielsen estimates there are 269 million potential
viewers in the U.S. age 2 and older. Viewership is listed in

<HD>Byrd Dance Company Says Huge Debt Did It In</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly a quarter-century after founding Donald Byrd/The Group in Los
Angeles, choreographer/company leader Byrd is shutting it down due to
what he characterized as overwhelming financial burdens. The last
performances of the 10-member company took place Sunday in Santa Fe,
New Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   Located in New York City since 1983, the company was best known
for daring psycho-sexual themes, sardonic social consciousness and a
complex modern dance-movement vocabulary heavily influenced by
contemporary ballet.</LD>
<LD>   Byrd's most recent company creations included two full-evening
showpieces, "Jazz Train" and "In a Different Light: Duke Ellington,"
seen at El Camino College in Torrance in recent years.</LD>
<TE>   However it was his 1996 "Harlem Nutcracker," a two-act African
American retelling of the Christmas classic, that saddled his company
with insurmountable debt, Byrd said. "We had all these payments that
we had to make monthly," Byrd, 53, told The Times on Tuesday, "and
that's made it almost impossible to meet the day-to-day operational
costs of the company."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have exact figures, but we paid off about $400,000, so
[the total debt] was about $800,000 for the four years that 'The
Harlem Nutcracker' was performed."</TE>
<TE>   The key issue was a funding shortfall, Byrd said. "We got no
'Nutcracker' funding from any major contributors. I don't know why
but they just backed away from it. And if I had been smart, I would
have said, 'Just forget it.' But my thinking was that a production
like this would serve the society at large, that we had a role to
play in the idea of art as a way of building community. So I did it
out of that kind of desire. And I was left holding the bag."</TE>
<TE>   "For the company, 'The Harlem Nutcracker' was supposed be like
capital campaigns for some organizations. It was supposed to push us
to the next level of institutionalization. And when you fail at that,
you're like a presidential candidate who doesn't win the election.
You are tossed out and forgotten."</TE>
<TE>   Byrd recently choreographed "The Seven Deadly Sins" for Pacific
Northwest Ballets. Some of his other 80 choreographic credits include
works for the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater in New York City,
Italy's Aterballetto, Dayton Contemporary Dance Company in Ohio and
Oregon Ballet Theatre. But he said he has no major upcoming freelance
commissions on his plate and isn't really seeking them.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in dance companies," he said, "and I believe the only
way that artists grow is through consistent and ongoing contact with
each other in an environment that encourages creativity. And it's
very hard to do that when you're freelancing. So I'm looking at the
possibility of directorships of other companies that have openings
for artistic directors."</TE>
<TE>   Even though Donald Byrd/The Group has gone under, its debt remains
and he's stuck with it. "The truth is," Byrd said, "that to pay it
off I probably will be an indentured servant for the rest of my
life."</TE>

<LD>He's 15 years old, has sold more than 3.5 million records and stars
in an upcoming feature film. But what exactly are we supposed to call
this young rapper and actor?</LD>
<LD>   We've known him as Lil' Bow Wow, and that's how he's billed in
"Like Mike," the basketball-themed movie that opens July 3. But at
the recent MTV Movie Awards, he was billed simply as Bow Wow.</LD>
<LD>   Is the pup growing up and having an identity crisis?</LD>
<TE>   "I'm getting older. I don't want to be known as Lil' right now,"
he barks (not really) over the phone. "For me, the whole Lil' thing
has gotten out of hand."</TE>
<TE>   But the "Lil' " handle has not been officially retired yet, says
manager--and mom--Teresa Caldwell.</TE>
<TE>   We'll abide by whatever they finally decide, as long as he doesn't
follow what Prince once did and ask to be ID'd with simply a symbol.
(What would it be, a bone?)</TE>
<TE>   And, for the record, young Mr. Wow (a.k.a. Shad Moss) stands 5
feet 1--but "I'm still growing," he snarls (no, really, we're making
that up).</TE>

<HD>Above the Law: The Privileged and the Powerful</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For those who harbor a sneaking suspicion that life isn't fair, here
comes a new program to help confirm things: "Dominick Dunne's Power,
Privilege and Justice."</LD>
<LD>   The documentary series, debuting at 10 tonight on Court TV, has a
simple premise: There's a justice system for the rich and famous, and
one for everybody else. Each week Dunne will introduce a case
involving people plucked from high society, whose arrogance
apparently led them to believe they were above the law. And in some
instances they turn out to be right.</LD>
<LD>   Dunne, a onetime Hollywood studio executive and now an author and
Vanity Fair columnist, seems a natural selection as host. He jumped
into prominence for many viewers during his coverage of the O.J.
Simpson murder trial, but it was the slaying of his daughter by her
boyfriend more than a decade earlier that helped push him into the
role of legal pundit.</LD>
<TE>   But Dunne really has very little to do here. Seated somberly at a
desk on a living room set, he briefly lays out the case and then
delivers several more short spiels over the next hour to keep the
case's narrative moving. But most of the heavy lifting is done via
sound bites from a procession of reporters, police, lawyers and some
of the principals. TV news footage and newspaper headlines (some with
dates that don't match the voice-overs) do the rest.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's case involves the 1987 murder of an Atlanta socialite
and the efforts to pin down suspect No. 1--her estranged millionaire
husband.</TE>
<TE>   Although it can be fascinating to jog along the twisting legal
path of such cases, there's probably a few too many switchbacks
tonight. And the ending, such as it is, is the biggest twist of all.</TE>

<TE>   Sunday lunch is an ideal time for entertaining friends. Consider
this Italian-inspired menu.</TE>
<TE>   A lively garden salad of mixed herbs and lettuce leaves starts the
meal. Follow it with a festive version of seafood marinara, most
appropriate for a luxurious lunch since it has as much seafood as
pasta. Make the dish ahead and reheat it at serving time. When first
assembling it, you cook the linguine and seafood just part way;
reheating will complete the cooking.</TE>
<TE>   For dessert, serve a refreshing strawberry-rhubarb sorbet with an
assortment of bakery cookies.</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons olive oil</TE>
<TE>   2 leeks, white and light green parts only, split lengthwise,
thinly sliced</TE>
<TE>   1 cup chopped parsley</TE>
<TE>   4 teaspoons minced garlic</TE>
<TE>   Zest of 2 large lemons</TE>
<TE>   1 cup dry white wine or dry vermouth</TE>
<TE>   1 to 2 cups bottled clam juice</TE>
<TE>   1 pound small mussels soaked in salted cold water for 1/2 hour,
drained, rinsed</TE>
<TE>   3/4 pound bay scallops, rinsed</TE>
<TE>   12 large shrimp, peeled and deveined</TE>
<TE>   2 to 3 cups marinara sauce</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons unsalted butter</TE>
<TE>   3/4 pound linguine or spaghetti, cooked half-recommended time,
drained</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup thinly sliced basil leaves, divided</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oil in a large shallow non-aluminum paella pan or
skillet. Add the leeks, parsley, garlic and lemon zest. Cook,
stirring often, until the leeks are slightly softened, about 3
minutes. Add the wine and 1 cup of clam juice; bring to a boil. Add
the mussels; cook, covered, until the shells just open, about 3
minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the mussels to a bowl. Set
aside.</TE>
<TE>   Add the scallops and shrimp to the pan. Cook halfway, just before
they turn opaque, about 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Stir
in 2 cups of the marinara sauce, the sugar, salt, red pepper flakes,
pepper and butter until melted. Stir in the linguine, juices from the
mussels and all but 1 tablespoon of basil leaves. Taste; adjust the
marinara and seasonings (especially the red pepper flakes). Scatter
mussels over the surface. (This can be made 2 hours ahead and kept at
room temperature, covered. To serve, reheat, covered, over medium
high heat, stirring occasionally, until hot, about 3 to 5 minutes. If
the mixture is thick, add the remaining clam broth as needed. If
still thick, moisten with more broth or water.) Garnish with reserved
basil. Serve immediately, family-style, in a casserole or pan.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   9 cups chilled mixed greens, such as basil, mint and oregano
leaves; baby arugula; stemmed watercress leaves; radicchio; and
romaine hearts</TE>
<TE>   1 small red onion, thinly sliced</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons grated Parmesan, preferably Parmigiano-Reggiano</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons lemon juice</TE>

<TE>   1/4 teaspoon minced garlic</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground black pepper</TE>
<TE>   Parmesan shavings</TE>
<TE>   Place the greens and the onion in a large bowl. Cover with a
dampened paper towel.</TE>
<TE>   Mix the oil, cheese, lemon juice, vinegar, mustard, garlic, salt
and pepper to taste in a mini-processor or shake in a jar.</TE>
<TE>   Pour 3/4 of the dressing over the salad. Gently toss until coated,
adding more dressing only if needed. Do not soak the greens. Taste;
adjust the salt and pepper. Serve immediately, family-style,
garnished with the shavings.</TE>

<HD>The Roping of Ale, the Mothering of Ketchup</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Centuries ago, before modern refrigeration and preservation came
along, people had a much more intimate knowledge of spoiled food than
we do and a specialized vocabulary for it.</LD>
<LD>   * "Ropy" meant full of slimy strands. Ale and wine were
particularly likely to rope, but even bread could become ropy.</LD>
<LD>   * "To reese" meant to turn rancid ("reesed," "reesty," even
"resty" or "rusty"), having the odor of oxidized fat.</LD>
<TE>   * "Foisty" or "fusty" comes from "foist," the name of a sort of
wine vat. It meant having the smell of a moldy old vat. Originally it
only applied to wine, but later anything that smelled of mold or
damp, including bread or meat, was called fusty.</TE>
<TE>   * "Mothery" referred to a liquid that had something growing in it,
like the "mother" that grows in vinegar. Wine and ketchup were
subject to mothering.</TE>
<TE>   The typical treatment was to boil or scald the spoiled ingredient.
One cure for "stinking venison" was to lay it in a mixture of
vinegar, ale and salt 12 hours, then boil it, then bake it. That
would certainly kill microbes, though it wouldn't necessarily take
away all the off-flavors.</TE>
<TE>   Another was cutting off the parts that had turned green, then
removing the meat from the bone and burying it in the ground
overnight. (Hey, as far as anybody knew back then, air was what
caused spoilage.)</TE>
<TE>   Medieval cooks used much more spice than we do, and a lot of
people imagine that it was to cover up the smell of spoiled meat. In
fact, no medieval recipe ever says anything like "if ye meat be foul,
strew great store of spice upon it." However, 17th and 18th century
cookbooks do recommend covering up the smell of spoiled meat by
cooking it with root vegetables and onions.</TE>

<LD>A perfectly ripe plum of the perfect variety, harvested on the
perfect summer day, shipped and stored in the perfect way and
delivered to you when you are in the perfect frame of mind to enjoy
it--this is a rare pleasure indeed.</LD>
<LD>   When you hit upon this set of circumstances, there's only one
thing to do. Rinse this heavenly fruit under cold running water;
gently pat it dry, then lean far out over the sink and gobble it in
huge, dripping bites. Anything else is superfluous.</LD>
<LD>   But for even the canniest fruit picker, this confluence of perfect
circumstances comes only a couple of times a summer. So what are you
supposed to do when the fruit gods haven't delivered perfect plums?</LD>
<TE>   Cookbooks, oddly enough, aren't much help. Plum recipes are even
scarcer than perfect plums. Even the sources that are usually most
reliable include only a couple--most ignore them altogether.</TE>
<TE>   The situation is so extreme it borders on the conspiratorial.
There is not one single dish that uses plums in the "Joy of Cooking."
Nor was there one in an old "Fannie Farmer" I checked, or in
Madeleine Kamman's "The Making of a Cook." As usual, Julia Child can
be relied upon--there are two recipes in "Mastering the Art of French
Cooking." That's a bounty by plum standards.</TE>
<TE>   The new "Chez Panisse Fruit" cookbook, so admirable in so many
ways, adds insult to this grievous injury. Of the seven recipes
included in the plum chapter, three are for prunes!</TE>
<TE>   It's hard not to take it personally, and in fact, maybe that's
exactly what it is. Plums, like certain people, are a little too,
well, definite for easy appreciation. While peaches and pears, apples
and strawberries are pleasantly convivial, lending themselves to all
sorts of endeavors, plums are acerbic. They are tart, often nearly to
the point of astringency. There is no mistaking a dish that contains
plums; no "Oh, this is nice, what is it?" When you're served a plum
dessert, you know it.</TE>
<TE>   But since when was assertiveness a bad thing? While plums may be
out of favor with those who prefer their fruit sweet and easygoing,
they are magical when combined with ingredients confident enough to
hold their own.</TE>
<TE>   Plums are also a great boon to cooks. They don't need to be peeled
(indeed, much of the pucker is in the peel--removing it will make
them sweeter, but less plum-like). You can just whittle them straight
into the mixing bowl. Best of all, unless a plum is really ripe, it
will have a near-perfect balance of pectin, sugar and acidity--it'll
turn to jam at a hot glance, no need for thickeners.</TE>
<TE>   There are two ways to deal with their assertive nature: either
complement it, or play against it. (Though there are hundreds of plum
varieties and they come in different colors, for the purposes of
recipes, they're pretty much interchangeable.)</TE>
<TE>   To complement a plum, think of things it tastes like. Cotes du
Rhone, the big red wines from Southern France, are usually described
as "plummy," but other common adjectives are "spicy" and "peppery."
Plums not only do well poached in red wine, they are also improved by
a generous hand with cloves, cinnamon and even black pepper. (Rhones
are also frequently described as "leathery" but, somehow in a
dessert, this does not appeal.)</TE>
<TE>   Plums also play well with almonds. This is only reasonable, since
they're both members of the drupe family of fruits. The likeness is
more than hereditary. The browned, buttery flavor of toasted almonds
rounds out and lends warmth to the fruit's tart personality.</TE>
<TE>   You can also go the other way, using flavors that are definite
enough to stand toe to toe with plums without backing down. Be
cautious here: While assertiveness is needed, if it's not carefully
considered you could wind up with strong flavors that do nothing but
clash--an Albee play in a dessert bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The combination of cornmeal and plums is a particularly apt
example of how this competition can work. A bit of cornmeal in
waffles, crepes or cake batters adds both old-fashioned grainy
sweetness and a faint trace of lingering bitterness that brings out
the best in plums.</TE>
<TE>   And somehow, no matter the dessert, a little bit of plain old
vanilla ice cream or lightly sweetened creme fraiche smoothes out
even the tartest plum. Think of it as soothing balm for a troubled
fruit.</TE>

<TE>   If you find really small plums, handball-size or slightly bigger,
they are absolutely beautiful when poached this way. If they're
bigger than that, you can cut them in halves, quarters or smaller
wedges.</TE>
<TE>   4 cloves</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns</TE>
<TE>   1 stick cinnamon</TE>
<TE>   1 cup red wine</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 pound plums</TE>
<TE>   Vanilla ice cream or lightly sweetened creme fraiche, for serving</TE>
<TE>   Place the cloves and peppercorns in the center of a 4-inch-square
piece of cheesecloth and tie the cloth in a bundle with a piece of
kitchen twine. Combine the bundle, the cinnamon stick, red wine and
sugar in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer. Cook until the
sugar is completely dissolved, about 2 to 3 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Add the plums and cook, keeping the wine at a bare simmer, until
the plums are just tender. Depending on the ripeness of the plums and
the size of the pieces, this will take between 5 and 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Drain the plums, discarding the cheesecloth bundle and the
cinnamon stick, and transferring the syrup into a smaller saucepan.
Return the syrup to the heat, and cook at a bare simmer until it has
reduced by half, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and return
the plums to the syrup. Set aside until ready to serve.</TE>
<TE>   Serve at room temperature with the ice cream or creme fraiche.</TE>

<TE>   Cornmeal Buckle With Plums</TE>

<TE>   A buckle is an old-fashioned American dessert, so named,
supposedly, because of the way the center collapses when it is
removed from the oven. This recipe is a twist on a boysenberry and
peach buckle from the newest revision of "Joy of Cooking." Replacing
some of the flour with cornmeal provides a bittersweet complement to
the tart-sweet plums.</TE>
<TE>   TOPPING</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   6 tablespoons flour</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter, cut into 1-tablespoon pieces</TE>
<TE>   In a food processor, pulse together the sugar, flour, salt and
butter until the pieces are the size of coarse crumbs.</TE>
<TE>   CORNMEAL BUCKLE</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter, softened, plus more for preparing pan,
divided</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups flour</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup yellow cornmeal</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons baking powder</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 egg</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup milk</TE>
<TE>   1 pound plums (about 4), cut up</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter a 9-inch glass pie plate and
set aside.</TE>
<TE>   In a large bowl, sift together the flour, cornmeal, baking powder
and salt.</TE>
<TE>   In another large bowl, beat the 1/4 cup of butter with the sugar
and egg until it is fairly light and fluffy. Add half of the milk and
beat until smooth. Gradually add the remaining milk while beating.</TE>
<TE>   Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients just until well
moistened. It will be the texture of cake batter. Fold in the plum
pieces. Pour the batter into the pie plate and spread evenly. Scatter
the topping mixture evenly over the top. Bake until the top is golden
brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about
45 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Remove from the oven and let stand 20 minutes before serving. (If
you serve the buckle the next day, warm it briefly in the microwave
before serving.)</TE>

<TE>   Plum-Almond Galette</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes</TE>

<TE>   Total Preparation Time: 1 hour, 20 minutes</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Galettes are carefree tarts. They are homey and casual and open to
all kinds of improvisation. Because the plums are so much on display
here, their sweetness is critical. Taste them and adjust the amount
of sugar accordingly. They should be tart, but not bitingly so. If
the fruit is extra ripe and juicy (not likely in June), scatter a
couple of tablespoons of ground almonds between the crust and the
fruit to absorb the moisture.</TE>
<TE>   DOUGH</TE>
<TE>   1 1/4 cups flour, plus more for kneading</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup slivered almonds</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, cut into 8 pieces</TE>
<TE>   2 to 3 tablespoons ice water</TE>
<TE>   Grind the flour, almonds, sugar and salt in a food processor until
the almonds are fine. Add the butter pieces and pulse until the
mixture is the texture of coarse crumbs. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of
ice water over the dry ingredients and pulse 4 or 5 times. If the
mixture begins to come together, stop now. Otherwise, keep sprinkling
the ice water, 1 teaspoon at a time, and pulsing until a dough begins
to form.</TE>
<TE>   Remove the dough from the food processor and quickly and lightly
knead on a floured work surface into a solid mass. Press into a disk,
wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   ASSEMBLY</TE>
<TE>   1 pound plums (about 4), cut up</TE>
<TE>   1 to 3 tablespoons sugar</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons slivered almonds</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon coarse sugar</TE>
<TE>   Combine the plums and the sugar in a work bowl and toss well to
mix. Set aside at room temperature until the dough is chilled.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Remove the dough from the
refrigerator and roll it out into a rough circle about 1/4 inch
thick. Transfer to a baking sheet.</TE>
<TE>   Drain any accumulated liquid from the plums. Spoon the plums into
the center of the dough. Fold the outside 2 inches of the dough
circle toward the center to make a hexagon, leaving the inner 4 or 5
inches of plums uncovered. Scatter the almonds across the plums, then
scatter the coarse sugar over the plums and the pastry.</TE>
<TE>   Bake until the pastry has browned and the plums are cooked
through, about 30 minutes.</TE>

<LD>It's easy to make a quick stop at the deli counter, come home and
pile sliced sandwich meats on a bun. But these light summer
sandwiches, which have all the crunch of a salad, take little time to
assemble and skip the fat and calories of deli meats.</LD>
<LD>   The vegetables can be varied; when I'm preparing these, I often
chop extra vegetables and put them in a resealable bag in the
refrigerator. That way, the next round of sandwiches is even faster
to prepare.</LD>
<LD>   I like to add a slice of yogurt cheese for protein and texture;
look for it at specialty markets. If you can't find it, substitute a
light mozzarella or other light cheese. Although the cheese adds some
fat, it still keeps the sandwich light compared with one made with
pastrami and the like.</LD>

<LD>Here is a guide to some of the most important plums grown in
California.</LD>
<LD>   Angeleno: A big plum with purple skin and amber flesh; despite a
grainy texture and mediocre flavor, it accounts for 19% of
California's commercial crop. Picked in September.</LD>
<LD>   Blackamber: A black-skinned plum with firm, light yellow flesh, it
is usually picked immature in June and July, producing a bland
flavor. Third leading California variety (10% of the crop).</LD>
<TE>   Damson: A small, oval, purple-skinned variety, with tart
astringency perfect for preserves. Found mostly at farmers markets
and in gardens in August.</TE>
<TE>   Elephant Heart: Large, with mottled brownish-purple skin, juicy,
blood-red flesh and rich, distinctive flavor. An August favorite at
farmers markets, but tastes grassy unless fully ripe.</TE>
<TE>   French prune: A purplish-blue plum with greenish flesh that's dry
and sweet. Picked in late August.</TE>
<TE>   Friar: Black with pale flesh; often bland, but fairly sweet when
ripe. The prototype of modern shipping plums and second leading
California variety (16%).</TE>
<TE>   Greengage: Green or golden skin and flesh and soft, intensely
sweet flavor. Supreme European dessert plums, but rare here;
occasionally found in Northern California in August.</TE>
<TE>   Kelsey:  A large, thin-skinned Asian variety with green fruit with
a small cavity near the pit. Picked in late July, it sweetens early,
while still hard.</TE>
<TE>   Laroda: Dark purple with pale violet flesh and rich winy flavor.
Picked mid-July.</TE>
<TE>   Mariposa: A big, round plum with green skin and mottled maroon
flesh. Sweet, juicy and rich in flavor. A late-July farmers market
favorite.</TE>
<TE>   Mirabelle:  Small, round, yellowish or golden, this very sweet
plum is superb fresh or made into jam. A small August crop in
Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   Myrobalan (cherry plum): Small cherry-like fruits, red, yellow or
black. Occasionally sold at farmers markets in June and July.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Rosa: Crimson-purple skin with amber flesh tinged red and
the classic sweet-tart fruity flavor. Picked in June and early July.</TE>
<TE>   Satsuma: Mottled maroon and green skin with dark red, meaty flesh;
this sweet variety is popular in Southern California gardens. Picked
late July.</TE>

<HD>Every Plum Imaginable</HD>
<DH>A three-year odyssey through the orchards of California
turns up a spectrum of extraordinary fruit</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KARP</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Santa Rosa plums on the tree near my window have started to
ripen, filling my room with their fruity bouquet. The crimson-purple
Santa Rosa is a plum with more personality than many of us are used
to these days, tart near the skin and pit with sweet flesh and
intense, almost overpowering, perfume.</LD>
<LD>   Not so long ago, it was the dominant plum in California. But
marketing demands--the need for durable fruit with a long shelf
life--have done to the plum very much what those same demands have
done to the tomatoes most people buy and complain so bitterly about.
But, as with the tomato, the situation is far from grim, thanks to
the willingness of many bold producers to swim against the tide.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, as I've traveled across the state during the last three
summers, I've found astounding diversity and, often, extraordinary
quality--plums new and old, big and small, green, black, purple, red
and yellow, tough and tender, wretched and exquisite--enough to
overwhelm any palate accustomed to the characterless impostors in the
grocery bin.</LD>
<TE>   For now, farmers markets and fruit stands are the places to look
for the best plums, although even chain stores will carry a fine
Santa Rosa when the season is in full swing.</TE>
<TE>   The plum season starts with a whisper in late May, with a few
weeks of so-so early varieties. The prime varieties start ripening
now and will be coming to market every week through September. This
year's harvest looks to be a good one in California, which produces
95% of the nation's fresh plum crop.</TE>
<TE>   There are three main kinds of plums grown in the United States:
American, European and Asian. For centuries, California Indians
harvested wild plums, but these are small and very tart. Spanish
missionaries and American settlers brought European types, such as
small, sweet greengages, tart culinary plums like damsons, and
prunes, which are plums that can be dried whole without fermenting.
Today, however, more than 96% of the plums grown for fresh market in
California are Asian types, which are relatively large, attractive
and productive.</TE>
<TE>   Luther Burbank, the celebrated plant breeder based in Santa Rosa,
was the father of California's Asian plum industry. Between 1885 and
his death in 1926, Burbank imported dozens of plum trees from Japan,
crossed them with other species, including some native to America,
and introduced more than 100 new varieties. Most fell into oblivion,
but about half a dozen, including the Santa Rosa, Satsuma, Kelsey and
Elephant Heart, are still grown today.</TE>
<TE>   Burbank's greatest creation, the Santa Rosa, has fallen out of
favor with farmers because they can no longer make money on it. The
Santa Rosa's share of the plum harvest has dropped from 35% in 1961
to just 4% today. The Santa Rosa is smaller than modern varieties
(though it was considered a big plum when it was introduced in 1906),
so it costs more to harvest, and chain store buyers prefer larger
fruit.</TE>
<TE>   In the last three decades, growers have dramatically increased
production of large, firm, black plums such as Friar and Blackamber,
which look ripe even when they're not, don't show bruises and
withstand rough handling and prolonged storage. Many are exported to
Taiwan and Hong Kong, and they hold up well during the long journey
by boat. As for flavor, there often isn't any.</TE>
<TE>   I observed the Blackamber's durability at Hosaka Farms in Reedley,
the center of the plum industry, which is 20 miles southeast of
Fresno. The workers started picking at dawn, while it was still cool,
singing softly to themselves and cracking jokes as they moved the
ladders around the orchard to strip the trees. They filled canvas
bags strapped to their chests, then opened a flap at the bottom to
dump the plums into huge plastic bins. When I sampled a few fruits,
even the darkest and ripest was bland, termed "neutral" in the trade.</TE>
<TE>   Such mild flavor can be a commercial advantage, said David
Ramming, a fruit breeder with the U.S. Department of Agriculture who
introduced the Blackamber and several other leading plum varieties.
"When a fruit has special aromas, not everybody likes them," he said
at his office. "If the flavor is really strong, it can limit the
market."</TE>
<TE>   The black skin and firm, amber flesh of many modern varieties
derive from Prunus simonii, an Asian plum species that also,
unfortunately, has mediocre flavor. Even so, Blackamber and Friar
would taste good, Ramming maintained, if farmers picked them ripe.
But most chain stores demand plums hard as rocks for a long shelf
life.</TE>
<TE>   Ramming himself enjoys highly flavored plums and is working to
preserve the Santa Rosa flavor in commercially viable varieties. It's
no cinch.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as we make them larger and firmer, we lose that
distinctive flavor," he said. "You really have to work to get all the
desirable characteristics together."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A private fruit breeder widely regarded as the Luther Burbank of
the modern age, Floyd Zaiger of Modesto, may have done just that. He
revolutionized the plum world by introducing his trademarked Pluots,
plum-apricot hybrids in which plum genes and characteristics prevail.</TE>
<TE>   From their introduction in the early 1990s, Pluots have seized a
quarter of the market for plum-like fruits, largely at the expense of
traditional plums. The best, such as Flavor Supreme, ripe now, and
Flavor King, which matures in August, are superbly sweet and
delicious.</TE>
<TE>   A recent genetic study of two Pluot varieties, however, has raised
the possibility that some Pluots may actually be purebred plums,
without an apricot component. Such a finding, if confirmed, would be
of more than academic interest to the research's sponsor, the
California Tree Fruit Agreement.</TE>
<TE>   This industry organization, which promotes and regulates the
state's plums (but not Pluots), is supported by an assessment of 20
cents on each 28-pound box; by remaining unregulated, Pluot farmers
will save almost $1 million this year on some 5 million boxes.</TE>
<TE>   Zaiger's daughter, Leith Gardner, who supervises the family's
breeding operations, said she believed that all the Pluots sold to
this point had some apricot genes. "That's what my records show," she
said. "But I can't be absolutely sure, and after six generations of
breeding, many of the hybrids are very complex."</TE>
<TE>   To further complicate matters, she added, some of the Zaigers'
just-released Pluots may also contain peach or nectarine genes. (All
of these hybrids are produced through conventional pollination, not
through controversial genetic modification.)</TE>
<TE>   There are other researchers working on such cutting-edge fruits,
but most of them serve as the proprietary breeders of large growers
and shippers and won't discuss their discoveries. On a broiling
afternoon last July, however, Jim Krause, general manager of C&amp;C
Nurseries, agreed to show me around his experimental planting in
Reedley.</TE>
<TE>   The nursery's strategy ran counter to conventional wisdom, I noted
with amazement, as I tasted an extraordinarily sweet and juicy plum
with bright golden-yellow skin and flesh. Hardly anyone grows
light-colored plums because they scuff and bruise easily. But C&amp;C has
planted 300 acres, half of which will bear fruit this year, of a
series of varieties called King Midas, all so delicate that they must
be wrapped in tissue paper and packed in the field.</TE>
<TE>   I also tried several experimental yellow-orange Tropical plums
with a surprising banana flavor; these probably contain apricot
genes, said Krause. I was a bit too early, however, to try any of the
Holiday plums intended to extend the Santa Rosa flavor into
late-season varieties.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, whereas every other breeding program strives for maximum
size in new plum selections, Krause showed me a series of Baby plums
the size of cherry tomatoes, intended, he said, for food service at
locations such as schools and military bases. "You can eat them with
one hand while you're driving," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As I drove away, my head was spinning, from the 106-degree heat
and the novelty of what I had just seen.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks later, at nearby Huerta Farms, I encountered an even
more outlandish variety called Broken Heart. As we walked through a
half-acre planting of this legendary curiosity, Elsie Huerta told me
the tale: About 15 years ago her friend Frank Vieira, a farmer in
Ivanhoe, Calif., noticed some odd greenish-yellow plums in a
just-picked batch of Elephant Heart, an old variety famous for its
brownish-purple skin and juicy, blood-red flesh.</TE>
<TE>   At first he scolded his workers for harvesting unripe fruit, but
they led him to a limb on one tree that bore only such plums. It was
a sport, a mutation. He was getting old, so he decided to give Huerta
the rights. Recently she grafted over another five acres.</TE>
<TE>   As she talked, I cut into a fruit and marveled at its bizarre
bicoloration. The luscious golden flesh was streaked with red,
radiating from the stone. I asked Huerta, "Is this why it's named
Broken Heart?" No, she said, her special plum was named in honor of a
long-lost boyfriend and her own broken heart.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For fruit quality, the differences among varieties are crucial,
but the influence of the growing area is also important. Or rather,
used to be: Fresno, Tulare and Kern counties now produce 98% of
California's plums. In its golden age between the wars, however,
Placer County alone shipped close to half of the state's crop and
enjoyed a nationwide reputation for the best fruit.</TE>
<TE>   "In the Sierra foothills, our cool nights allow the plums to hang
on the trees longer, so they develop deeper color and flavor," said
80-year-old Robert Hansen, whose father started growing plums in
Loomis in 1908. When I tasted some of his Larodas, picked tree-ripe
into small wooden lugs, they indeed had a complex, winy flavor with a
complement of sparkling acidity. "Chiropractic plums," he called
them, "because they're so juicy you have to bend forward to eat
them."</TE>
<TE>   Once there were 23 packing sheds between Roseville and Colfax, but
with the growth of irrigated agriculture on the flat, deep soil of
the San Joaquin Valley, those farms proved three times as productive
as orchards in the foothills; factor in suburban development and the
passing of generations, and Placer County's last packing co-op,
Loomis Fruit Growers, closed in spring last year. Hansen, the last
president, kept it alive for its 100th anniversary; now he and his
family depend on farmers markets and a packer in El Dorado County to
sell their 30 acres of plums.</TE>
<TE>   Against all odds, one farmer, 83-year-old Howard Nakae of
Newcastle, is battling to restore the vitality of Placer County
plums. Ironically, one of the area's commercial disadvantages--its
late harvest--may prove its salvation.</TE>
<TE>   Sun World International, a huge grower based in Bakersfield, has
enjoyed great demand for its Black Diamond, a sweet dark-skinned,
red-fleshed proprietary variety. To extend the season by three weeks,
Sun World asked Nakae to plant 85 acres in the rolling foothills near
Lincoln. When I visited last July, the 3-year-old trees bore
disappointingly few fruits, due to rain during bloom (plums are
notoriously finicky in their pollination requirements), but Nakae
expects a good crop this year.</TE>
<TE>   In the most distant corner of the state, there is another farm
clinging to tradition: the only remaining commercial orchard of
native Sierra plums, which grow wild in the mountains of northeastern
California. A mile south of the Oregon border, flanked by the
shallow, 20-mile-long Goose Lake to the west, and the Warner
Mountains to the east, is a wild, lonely valley where cattle and hay
are the main crops. When I arrived on a misty September morning, John
Stringer, 47, showed me his orchard of 3,000 shrubby trees, loaded
with small, round, cherry-red fruits, from which he makes wines and
jams. "I'm at elevation 4,600 feet," he said. "It can snow any month
of the year, so only wild plums are hardy enough to grow here."</TE>
<TE>   Stringer popped a few fruits in his mouth as he picked a bucket to
sell at his roadside store. "It's not really an eating plum," he
said. "Not unless you're born here." As he picked I tried a few
fruits, which had tart flesh and astringent skin--not unlike the
native plum that Burbank bred with Asian varieties to add a
mysterious tinge to his Santa Rosa.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At his farm south of San Jose, another quixotic dreamer, Andy
Mariani, maintains a collection of about 500 rare varieties of stone
fruit, a true treasure of California agriculture. Of his plums, his
favorites are the greengages, arguably the most exquisite, richly
flavored fruits in the world. Once, when the Santa Clara Valley was
America's greatest prune district, farmers grew these European plums
for canning, but no longer, since the factories and subdivisions of
Silicon Valley have sprawled over the ghosts of vanished orchards.</TE>
<TE>   Each August, I find time to visit Mariani for the greengage
harvest. Invariably, as he guides me through the dozen or so
greengage trees, he resorts to quoting Edward Bunyard's "The Anatomy
of Dessert," the 1929 bible of fruit connoisseurs. On the Old Green
Gage, Bunyard said, "In no fruit is supreme ripeness more necessary."</TE>
<TE>   On Coe's Golden Drop, a greengage hybrid: "At its ripest it is
drunk rather than eaten."</TE>
<TE>   On the Transparent Gage, another greengage relative: One sees "a
slight flush of red and then one looks into the depths of transparent
amber as one looks into an opal, uncertain how far the eye can
penetrate."</TE>
<TE>   At his farm stand in Morgan Hill, Mariani offers just a few of
these delicate fruits, along with tiny, super-sweet mirabelles,
beloved of European jam makers. He always warns me, "Don't tell
people that I have a commercial orchard of these things." His output
is just too small.</TE>
<TE>   For years, it has been my own quixotic dream to find a commercial
greengage orchard in California. Many farmers claim to grow
greengages, but these almost always turn out to be Asian varieties,
which look vaguely similar but have nothing like the flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, I got another call. Albert Vera, the owner of Sorrento
market in Culver City and that city's former mayor, told me that he
had planted a new orchard in Porterville, and he thought the trees
were true greengages.Last Friday, I braced myself for
disappointment--and pointed my truck north once again.</TE>
<TE>   Three hours later, I arrived at the orchard. The farm manager, Dan
Murphee, led me to a block of about 50 slender young trees, part of
200 planted in January. Long, thin leaves, light spots on the
wood--they looked suspiciously like Asian plums. Still, the tags on
the new trees bore the label "green gage."</TE>
<TE>   I clipped a branch and brought it to Craig Ledbetter, a
stone-fruit breeder at the San Joaquin Valley Agricultural Sciences
Center in nearby Parlier. Later that afternoon, he identified it:
Without a doubt, it was an Asian plum. And I was foiled again.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere in California, I believe, there remains a producing
orchard of true greengages. If it takes another three years, I am
determined to find it--and if it doesn't exist, I'll grow it myself.</TE>

<LD>It's hard to resist the first corn of the season. But after you've
eaten a few ears, try using corn creatively. This dish combines fresh
corn with bell pepper and green onion to make a bed for seared
scallops.</LD>
<LD>   Slicing the kernels from the cob is easy; place the stem end down
on the counter or in a shallow bowl and with a sharp knife, cut down
on the cob. The kernels may go flying, which is why a bowl helps
contain them.</LD>
<LD>   Scallops are quick to prepare and available year-round. Be sure to
blot them dry before searing.</LD>

<TE>   Seared Scallops and Fresh Corn Salad</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 20 minutes</TE>
<TE>   16 jumbo scallops, about 1 1/2 pounds</TE>
<TE>   2 ears corn</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon vegetable oil</TE>
<TE>   1 red bell pepper, diced small</TE>
<TE>   2 green onions, green parts only, thinly sliced</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup thinly sliced basil leaves</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup chopped cilantro</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons butter, divided</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1 head Bibb lettuce</TE>
<TE>   1 avocado, diced</TE>
<TE>   Place the scallops between paper towels to absorb any excess
moisture and set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Cut the kernels from the ears of corn. Heat the vegetable oil in a
large skillet over medium heat. Add the corn, red pepper and green
onions and cook until the corn is crisp tender, about 5 minutes.
Place the corn mixture in a bowl and add the basil and cilantro and
season with salt and pepper to taste.</TE>
<TE>   Wipe out the same skillet, add 1 tablespoon of butter and heat
over high heat. When the butter has melted and starts to foam, add
half of the scallops, making sure not to crowd them in the pan. Sear
until they're golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the scallops over
and cook until slightly firm, 1 to 2 minutes more. Remove and cook
the remaining scallops in the remaining tablespoon of butter.</TE>
<TE>   Place the vinegar, olive oil and salt and pepper to taste in a
small bowl and whisk to combine.</TE>
<TE>   Place 2 lettuce leaves on each plate to form a cup to hold the
corn mixture. Spoon the corn mixture evenly into each. Place 1/4 of
the scallops on each plate and drizzle the dressing over and around
the scallops. Scatter the avocado on top.</TE>

<HD>Big Sell on Sunset</HD>
<DH>At a new restaurant, the price is right. And five hours

<LD>The longest line on the Sunset Strip on Friday night wasn't at
Skybar, Rande Gerber's hangout for the beautiful people, and it
wasn't at the Roxy, where Johnny Was and Starrgun were rocking the
black T-shirt crowd. It was at Rome Italian Cucina, a new restaurant
on the first floor of the landmark 9000 Sunset building.</LD>
<LD>   At the 6 p.m. opening time, the line to get in stretched a block
and a half and took two bouncers to manage. Why were all those
would-be diners there? It wasn't to gape at the restaurant's coved
ceilings, painted--the owners brag--like the Sistine Chapel. It
wasn't the reputation of chef Shad Davis--the restaurant claims he's
"world-renowned," but nobody seems to have ever heard of him. And it
certainly wasn't because of his cucina--most of those in line would
get only scraps.</LD>
<LD>   The line, estimated at a steady 500-strong that night, was a
testament to the age-old allure of canny marketing and free food.</LD>
<TE>   In one of the most flamboyant restaurant openings in memory,
restaurateurs Larry Pollack and Tom Dillon decided to give away free
dinners for an entire week to whoever showed up. Not just their
friends. Not just a few selected celebrities. Everyone.</TE>
<TE>   To ensure the widest possible audience, they printed their
invitation in splashy two-page ads in the Thursday and Sunday
editions of the Los Angeles Times: a free dinner for up to four
people, including appetizers, salads, entrees and desserts, served
from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. to anyone bearing a coupon.</TE>
<TE>   The promotion ends tonight. And by the time the last vitello
Milanese is cleared, Pollack estimates that more than 3,000 diners
will have consumed $100,000 worth of classic Italian fare.</TE>
<TE>   In an era when most restaurants choose to open quietly, building
an audience slowly over time, this was a big bang. "We wanted to
create a shock, do something original," says Pollack. "We wanted to
get the name out there in a quick way and in a big way."</TE>
<TE>   That they did. The free food and the enormous ads have had the
city buzzing all week. The restaurant has been discussed on radio
stations across Southern California and featured on the television
news. It has popped up on foodie Web sites whose attention is usually
fixed on the top culinary ranks, say, Nancy Silverton or Suzanne
Goin. "We didn't do any other advertising," Pollack says, "but
they're all talking about it."</TE>
<TE>   Joan Luther, Los Angeles' grande dame of restaurant publicity,
says that in a career dating back to the glory days of Scandia and
the Brown Derby, she can't remember anything like it.</TE>
<TE>   "But it obviously worked," she says. "Even I, when I saw that ad,
thought, 'I've got to go by and see it for myself.' I just cannot
believe it."</TE>
<TE>   It's also the first time Pollack and Dillon have tried anything
like this. They own two other scene restaurants on the
Strip--Miyagi's, a three-story sushi bar at the other end of Sunset,
and Saddle Ranch Chop House, a steak place that features a mechanical
bucking bull--and both of those opened quietly.</TE>
<TE>   "With the other restaurants we've done a slower build," Pollack
says. "We usually invite a lot of friends of employees and friends of
mine and so on. It usually takes anywhere from three to four months
to get the word out there. We thought we'd expedite the building
process. We never anticipated the amount of response."</TE>
<TE>   Rome is not the only restaurant to be built in this way, but it is
by far the most extreme example. Porterhouse Bistro, a steak place in
Beverly Hills that opened a year ago, recently sent out more than
75,000 letters by first-class mail, offering free food. At first, the
coupons were good for the entire meal, now they're down to a steak.</TE>
<TE>   For most of her clients, Luther advises avoiding any kind of
opening party.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with the traditional grand opening, she says, is
putting together the guest list: "Twenty-five years ago, you could
put together a pretty good list of the people in Los Angeles who
would go to a good restaurant, so you could invite most of them and
get the word of mouth started.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, I couldn't even guess who they would be. The city has
grown so much."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to who is invited, she also worries about who is not.
"Why offend anyone?" Luther asks. "People in Los Angeles are very
uptight about that. They can really get on their high horse."</TE>
<TE>   Friday night on the Strip, nobody was on a horse of any kind.</TE>
<TE>   The first customers lined up at about 4 p.m., two hours before the
130-seat restaurant opened. They, it turned out, would be the lucky
ones.</TE>
<TE>   By 6, the line stretched down the block, a Hollywood mix of
hipsters and oldsters, of thrifty Beverly Hills matrons and starving
USC students, and the merely curious.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Calles and her friend Edith Garcia, a couple of
30-somethings who work in the area, thought they'd stop in. "I just
wanted to see what this was all about," Calles said. "I thought it
sounded too good to be true. I called to ask them what the catch was
and they said, 'No catch.' You have to buy your own drinks, but, hey,
I figured I could handle that."</TE>
<TE>   Edie Batu, a stylish woman from Beverly Hills, was there with her
date, Leonard Fisher from Marina del Rey. "We were getting together
anyway, so it seemed like a good idea," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher wasn't so sure. "I don't know if I can wait two hours for
dinner," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As the evening stretched on, the line inched forward. Ron
Defibaugh, who had driven up from San Diego when his mother said she
wanted to go, found her a bench at a bus stop where she could sit and
read her Reader's Digest while he held a place in line.</TE>
<TE>   "At first I thought, 'How good can it be?' Then when we got here I
thought, 'How crazy do I have to be to stand in line for this?' " he
said. "But she wanted to try it."</TE>
<TE>   From time to time, a waitress appeared carrying a plate of warm
crostini spread with pesto and a white bean puree. It was quite
acceptable--especially after an hour in line.</TE>
<TE>   At first, people waited their turns politely. By 7:30, the mood
had turned.</TE>
<TE>   "We've really got to go," Calles said impatiently. "But what I'm
afraid of is that because this line is so long, everyplace else on
the Strip is going to be packed, too. We'll give it five more
minutes."</TE>
<TE>   At 8:15, Calles and Garcia left. "We could wait here forever and
never eat," Garcia said.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after, Batu and Fisher gave up, too. "There may be such a
thing as a free meal, but you usually wind up paying for it somehow,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Just about then, the first of the early birds started to leave the
restaurant. Hy Cohen, wearing a white guayabera and a Maui baseball
cap and carrying a doggie bag, pronounced himself well pleased.</TE>
<TE>   "We got here about 4:30 and were the third in line," said Cohen,
who lives in the Fairfax district. "It's absolutely delicious. We
were very very impressed."</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Doris, seemed especially thrilled. "I had the filet
mignon and it's usually $26.50," she said. "My husband had the lamb
shanks and they're usually $19.75. Plus we had appetizers, plus we
had soup, plus we had dessert. The only thing we paid for was a cup
of coffee and a beer."</TE>
<TE>   "That was $7," her husband said. "I can handle that."</TE>
<TE>   Briefly, the line took heart. And then, finally, at 8:45, the door
was in sight. After almost three hours, dinner was near.</TE>
<TE>   "Really, it hasn't been bad," said USC student Azalea Lee, who was
waiting with her date Michael Ivankay.</TE>
<TE>   At last inside, the crowd milled among the electric-blue booths
and the few, well-spaced tables, peering upward at the Day-Glo
"Sistine Chapel" frescoes on the ceiling. A crew from Fox News
arrived and a manager rushed over to be filmed pouring wine for a
happy party of six. The hostess began taking names for seating.</TE>
<TE>   "It'll probably be another two hours before we can serve you," she
said cheerfully.</TE>
<TE>   Lee and Ivankay disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   A waitress circulated with slices of hot pizza.</TE>
<TE>   Defibaugh found his mother another place to sit.</TE>
<TE>   And outside, another 500 were still waiting.</TE>

<LD>Who says a quiche needs to have a pastry crust? I took some leftover
cooked rice--which I always seem to have in the refrigerator--and
fashioned a crust to make this variation.</LD>
<LD>   A rice crust is lighter than pastry, and it won't become soggy
like a pastry crust might. The rice becomes crusty and golden as it
bakes, forming a nice, crisp contrast to the creamy interior of the
quiche. Meanwhile, tarragon adds a different flavor.</LD>
<LD>   Serve this with a garden salad tossed with baby red tomatoes and a
glass of Chardonnay.</LD>

<TE>   Chard Quiche With Rice Crust</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 30 minutes *</TE>
<TE>   Total Preparation Time: 1 hour</TE>
<TE>   Soppressata, a dry Italian salami, can be found at well-stocked
supermarkets.</TE>
<TE>   Butter, for preparing pan</TE>
<TE>   1/4 pound soppressata, cut into 1/2-inch dice</TE>
<TE>   1 onion, thinly sliced</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon olive oil, optional</TE>
<TE>   2 cloves garlic, minced</TE>
<TE>   4 cups chopped Swiss chard leaves</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   2 cups cooked rice</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons butter</TE>
<TE>   1 1/4 cups shredded Gruyere cheese</TE>
<TE>   4 eggs, slightly beaten</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup milk</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh tarragon</TE>
<TE>   1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</TE>
<TE>   1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 450 degrees. Butter a 9-inch quiche pan.</TE>
<TE>   Fry the soppressata in a heavy skillet over medium heat until
crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove and reserve. In the same pan, cook the
onion in the fat rendered from the soppressata until transparent and
golden, about 6 to 8 minutes. Remove the onion and reserve along with
the soppressata. If all the fat from the soppressata is gone, add 1
tablespoon of olive oil to the pan. Add the minced garlic, cook about
30 seconds, then add the chard and a dash of salt. Cook quickly over
medium heat until just slightly wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Set aside
with the soppressata and onion.</TE>
<TE>   Place the rice in a bowl. Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a very
small saucepan, pour this over the rice and mix. Pat the rice inside
the quiche pan as evenly as possible to make a crust. It is easiest
to moisten your fingertips so the rice will not stick as you line the
quiche pan. Place the reserved soppressata, onion and chard evenly
over the inside of the rice shell. Sprinkle the cheese on top.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the eggs, cream, milk, tarragon, nutmeg, cayenne pepper
and 1/2 teaspoon of salt in a bowl and beat thoroughly. Pour slowly
over the vegetables and cheese in the shell.</TE>
<TE>   Bake 15 minutes, then lower the heat to 350 degrees and bake the
quiche until just set in the center, about 25 to 30 more minutes. Let
rest a few minutes before slicing.</TE>

<TE>   CREPES</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons butter</TE>
<TE>   1 cup flour</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/8 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1 1/4 cups milk</TE>
<TE>   1 egg, lightly beaten</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon oil</TE>
<TE>   Melt the butter over medium heat in a small skillet and cook until
light brown. Strain through a fine mesh strainer and discard the
solids.</TE>
<TE>   Sift together the flour, sugar and salt into a large bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Mix the milk and egg together and stir into the dry ingredients.
Add the butter and stir to mix well. Set aside to rest 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Heat a medium non-stick skillet over medium heat. Brush lightly
with oil. Pour 1/4 cup of the batter into the skillet and tip back
and forth to just coat the bottom. Cook until the edges just begin to
turn brown and curl slightly, about 30 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Using a spatula to lift the edge, turn the crepe over and cook
another 30 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Stack the finished crepes between sheets of parchment.</TE>
<TE>   ORANGE SAUCE AND ASSEMBLY</TE>
<TE>   Juice of 6 oranges</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup apricot jam</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup Grand Marnier</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon orange zest</TE>
<TE>   Vanilla ice cream, for serving</TE>
<TE>   1 orange, peeled and separated into segments</TE>
<TE>   Bring the orange juice to a boil in a small saucepan. Add the
apricot jam and cook to thicken, about 15 minutes. Add the Grand
Marnier, butter and orange zest and simmer 5 more minutes.</TE>
<TE>   To serve, place 1 small scoop of ice cream on each crepe. Fold the
crepe in half, then fold in half again, to make a quarter. Put 2
crepes on each plate and warm in a 400-degree oven 1 minute.</TE>
<TE>   Pour the sauce around the crepes and garnish each plate with 2 to
3 orange segments. Serve immediately before the ice cream melts.</TE>

<HD>Merlot: What's Happened to the Wine Industry's Darling?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES E. OLKEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Merlot bandwagon has thrown a wheel. You feel it at the wineries,
where Merlot no longer excites winemakers. You see it in wine stores,
where the shelf space devoted to Merlot shrinks and, apart from a few
reserve-type bottlings, this once proud varietal is now selling at
Zinfandel prices.</LD>
<LD>   Whither Merlot? The answer should emerge over the next decade, as
winemakers adjust to a drinking public no longer willing to shell out
big dollars for an easy-to-drink but all-too-ordinary wine. Only two
kinds of Merlots are selling well in today's marketplace, and I think
they are the shape of things to come.</LD>
<LD>   On one hand are the Cabernet-like Merlots, with their highly ripe,
concentrated fruit and rich, fleshy textures. Labels such as Duckhorn
Three Palms Vineyard and Beringer Bancroft Ranch have defined this
end of the market for years, and they are joined by some smaller
producers including Laird, Paoletti and Delectus. But eventually
these wines will be measured against Cabernet Sauvignon for longevity
and complexity. If they can grow into better, more interesting
versions, then their place will be secure. If not, expect this
category to shrink until only a small handful command $50-and-higher
price tags.</LD>
<TE>   At the other end of the scale are the mid-priced Merlots--the
wines that sell for Zinfandel-like prices and offer lots to like in
the short to intermediate term. Among the better ones are the Merlots
of Chappellet and Whitehall Lane and the single-vineyard bottlings of
Chateau Ste. Michelle (at a few dollars more, admittedly).</TE>
<TE>   There will certainly be other Merlots for years to come, and a
good value will pop up in the $12-to-$20 range from time to time. A
couple are recommended below. Unless Merlot regains its old luster,
this lower end of the price spectrum will mirror the Chardonnay
experience, and over-planting will result in an increasing flow of
good, not great, wines at serviceable prices.</TE>
<TE>   * 1998 Artesa Winery, Napa Valley, $22. For sheer enjoyment, here
is a Merlot that will meet anybody's requirements, regardless of how
popular the grape. You immediately notice enticing aromas of sweet
smoke and creme brulee that rise above well-defined ripe cherry
fruit. On the palate, it captures the grape's supple potential, and
its modest tannins are also in keeping with what Merlot can easily
deliver. If the producers will hold to this style for their
mid-priced Merlots, they will not have to worry about the grape's
future.</TE>
<TE>   ** 1999 Canoe Ridge Vineyard, "Reserve Lot 10," Columbia Valley,
$42. Merlot has been a very consistent producer for Washington
wineries, and this latest effort from Canoe Ridge shows why. It is
supple, rich and mouth-filling, without Cabernet's tougher tannins.
It has the open, tasty fruit to go with duck or pork but the firmness
of structure to stand up to simple beefsteaks and roasts. Merlot does
not have to imitate Cabernet to be successful.</TE>
<TE>   $** 1999 Chappellet Vineyard, Napa Valley, $22. Chappellet's
hillside location tends to produce somewhat firmer Merlots, but, when
they come with depth and concentrated fruit, and carry an altogether
inviting price tag, they will remain popular. The wine's youthful
astringency aids in its serviceability with savory dishes; I
particularly enjoyed it with slices of duck breast in mole sauce.</TE>
<TE>   ** 1999 Chateau Ste. Michelle, "Cold Creek Vineyard," $30. Chateau
Ste. Michelle's Merlots are always on the firmer but fruity side, and
this one captures the best of both worlds in aromas of red cherries,
dried flowers and creamy oak. Supple and polished at the front of the
palate and juicy in the manner of good Merlot, its tannins provide a
bit of grip and muscle for aging.</TE>
<TE>   $* 2000 Cinnabar Winery, Paso Robles, $14. No wine in my recent
tastings of about 100 Merlots offers as much value as this ripe,
direct, tasty effort. Paso Robles is a bit warm for classic Merlot
but it is nicely filled with black cherry flavors and is ready to
drink tonight with anything from burgers to beef carbonnade.</TE>
<TE>   ** 1999 Delectus, "Stanton Vineyard," Oakville, Napa Valley, $40.
Owner-winemaker Gerhardt Reisacher just laughed when I asked about
Merlot's impending demise. "Maybe for some people," he said, "but not
for Delectus. Our Merlot is incredibly popular." Of course, I was
visiting Delectus in the first place because I had just tasted this
wine, and I wanted to meet the folks behind the winery posthaste. The
wine is filled with deep, buoyant, succulent fruit presented in the
plush, mouth-filling texture that the leading Merlots strive to
capture. I suspect that this wine is one of the few Merlots that will
also please Cabernet drinkers.</TE>
<TE>   $ 1999 Fetzer Vineyards, "Barrel Select," Sonoma County, $11. When
Chardonnay reached surplus conditions in the vineyards and wineries,
the number of very good values in the $10-to-$12 range grew
exponentially. Is this wine the harbinger of things to come for
Merlot? If so, we can expect to see a continuing supply of medium- to
medium-full-bodied, ripe, open, easy-to-drink bottlings with more
depth than heretofore at the price. It might just be enough to save
Merlot's place for the "wine by the glass" drinkers.</TE>
<TE>   ** 1999 Miner, Stagecoach Vineyard, Napa Valley, $33. Here is
another Merlot that can hold its own in a Cabernet-oriented world.
Its voluminous flavors of cherries and currants, of sweet oak and
toffee carry Cabernet-like complexity, yet the wine sells for half
the price of comparable Cabs. It has Merlot's texture and is for
aging five to 10 years, rather than two decades. That difference
aside, it will please all but those who like their reds to have as
much sinew as possible.</TE>
<TE>   1998 Whitehall Lane Winery, Knights Valley, $22. I have always
liked the Merlots from Whitehall Lane. This one's frontal fruit and
medium-density mark it as a wine for the near term, but that is no
sin in my book. My cellar is filled with wines that have to sit
quietly for years, and I rather enjoy finding a bottle that will be
wholly satisfying on the day I purchase it.</TE>

<LD>This pretty little red comes from Entre-Deux-Mers, a part of Bordeaux
best known for commercial, everyday wines. It's rare to find old
vines there, especially being used in such a reasonably priced wine,
but this is a blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon from a hillside
vineyard of 35-year-old vines. It has wonderful concentration and
depth of flavor, and there's a touch of Cabernet Franc for spice.</LD>
<LD>   Deep violet in color, laced with soft, ripe tannins, tasting of
ripe red fruit and spices, it's exactly the kind of wine the people
of Bordeaux seek out for their own drinking. Believe me, they're not
opening a Petrus or a Margaux every night.</LD>
<LD>   Stock this one for barbecues and any other red-wine occasions that
come your way this summer.</LD>

<HD>Detailing Accounting Oversight Ideas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Senate Banking Committee and the Securities and Exchange
Commission have issued separate proposals for a new
accounting-industry oversight board.</LD>
<LD>   Here's a look at the proposed makeup and functions of the board,
as described in a bill passed by the Senate committee Tuesday and in
a draft the SEC will consider at a meeting Thursday:</LD>
<LD>   * Board makeup: The Senate bill proposes a five-member board, with
no more than two members from the accounting profession. Members
initially would be appointed by the SEC and would serve five-year
terms.</LD>
<TE>   The SEC proposes a nine-member board; no more than three could be
practicing or retired accountants. Members initially would be
approved by the SEC and would serve three-year terms.</TE>
<TE>   * SEC oversight: The Senate bill requires all board rules to be
approved by the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC proposal would give the agency the right to review, modify
or rescind any board rules.</TE>
<TE>   * Industry membership: All accounting firms would be required to
register with the new board under both the Senate proposal and the
SEC plan.</TE>
<TE>   * Board funding: The Senate bill calls for the board to be funded
by fees paid by corporations (the users of accounting services) and,
if the board so decides, by fees levied on accounting firms.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC calls for funding by accounting firms and by companies.</TE>
<TE>   * Disciplinary powers: Under both the Senate proposal and the SEC
plan, the board would have the authority to investigate, and require
testimony and documents from, any accounting firm. The board could
request testimony from non-accountants, but would not have subpoena
power.</TE>
<TE>   Both proposals also would give the board the power to discipline
accounting firms, using fines, censure, license revocation and other
penalties.</TE>
<TE>   Under the SEC plan, only the six non-accountant members of the
board could vote on disciplinary measures.</TE>
<TE>   * Standard-setting: The Senate proposal gives the board the
authority to establish auditing standards and ethics standards for
accounting firms. The Senate bill specifically requires the board to
mandate that audit work papers be kept for seven years, and that an
accounting firm's audit report of a company include the results of
the auditor's testing of the company's compliance with financial
reporting laws.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate bill also specifies several other accounting standards
the board would have to adopt.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC proposal simply gives the board the right to set
standards, without spelling out specifics.</TE>
<TE>   * Public reports: Disciplinary sanctions by the board would be
made public under both the Senate proposal and the SEC plan.</TE>
<TE>   The board also would be required, under both plans, to issue an
annual report of its activities.</TE>

<HD>Costa Mesa's QSC Loses Bose Trademark Appeal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bose Corp., maker of the "Wave" radio, persuaded a federal appeals
court to block QSC Audio Products Inc. from registering as a
trademark an amplifier system under the "PowerWave" name.</LD>
<LD>   In opposing the Costa Mesa firm's application, Bose said consumers
would think the QSC product was made by Bose, which also sells the
Acoustic Wave loudspeaker system. The U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office's Trademark Trial and Appeal Board had rejected Bose's
complaint, saying confusion was unlikely.</LD>
<LD>   Reversing the board's ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit said the Wave name should be given added protection
under trademark laws, because it's famous even when not directly
linked to the Bose name.</LD>
<TE>   "We're going to evaluate what our options are," said John Andrews,
chief operating officer of QSC. "We don't have any intention of
stopping use of the mark."</TE>
<TE>   Bose lawyer Charles Hieken, of Fish &amp; Richardson in Boston, said
the company might ask a court to order QSC to stop using the name.</TE>
<TE>   QSC has been using the name PowerWave since 1994, and "there's
never been one instance of confusion that we've seen or that Bose
submitted" before the trademark board, Andrews said. The PowerWave
name has a trademark registration in California, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Wave radios, selling for $300 to $500 each, have annual sales
of about $100 million, according to court papers filed by Bose, based
in Framingham, Mass. The Acoustic Wave, selling for about $1,000
each, generates about $50 million in annual sales.</TE>
<TE>   PowerWave is a patented system that improves amplifiers while
making them more compact, the QSC Web site says.</TE>

<BD>Dow Jones Newswires</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange-based Sybron Dental Specialties Inc. said Tuesday that it
expects to post charges totaling $8.4 million in the third quarter
related to rate swaps, finance fees and refinancing.</LD>
<LD>   It also said in a press release that plans for expanding its Hawe
Neos facility in Switzerland, a key component of the company's
tax-reduction strategy, is a "little" behind schedule.</LD>
<LD>   Sybron said it expects to record an unspecified fourth-quarter
restructuring charge related to the Hawe's plan, which includes the
consolidation of Sybron's other facilities in Europe.</LD>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, Sybron said it will change the way it accounts for
inventory in the third quarter. The maker of dental products will
restate its financial results for the last five years and interim
periods to reflect the inventory accounting change to first in, first
out, from last in, first out.</TE>
<TE>   Sybron stock closed at $21.40 Tuesday, down 33 cents, on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Jack in the Box Expects Profit to Beat Estimates</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jack in the Box Inc. said profit in the fiscal third and fourth
quarters will exceed expectations as the fast-food chain converts
five company sites to franchised units and spends less on food and
packaging.</LD>
<LD>   The San Diego-based company also said sales will get a boost in
the second half of the year from the introduction of a sandwich and
increased advertising on lower-price items, the company said.</LD>
<LD>   The company raised its forecast for third-quarter profit to 60
cents a share from its earlier guidance of 57 cents and hiked its
fourth-quarter forecast by 11 cents to 67 cents. Analysts on average
were expecting earnings of 57 cents and 58 cents, respectively,
according to Thomson First Call.</LD>

<HD>Specialty Laboratories to Cut 10% of Work Force</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Specialty Laboratories Inc., which conducts medical tests for
laboratories and hospitals, said it is cutting 10% of its 800-member
work force to reduce costs.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Monica-based Specialty Labs said it will have significant
expenses in the second quarter related to the reduction.</LD>
<LD>   In April, Specialty Laboratories said the government threatened to
suspend Medicare and Medicaid payments and revoke the company's
license, alleging that laboratory-test services had been performed by
unlicensed staff.</LD>
<TE>   The company appealed the government's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Specialty Laboratories shares fell 2 cents to $7.70 on the NYSE.
The company made the announcement after the close of U.S. markets.</TE>

<HD>Best Buy, Circuit City Earnings Rise, but Price War Is
Feared</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Best Buy Co. and Circuit City Stores Inc. reported higher quarterly
earnings Tuesday, but shares of the two top U.S. consumer electronics
retailers fell on fears they have begun a price war that could hit
profits.</LD>
<LD>   Although Minneapolis-based Best Buy, the No. 1 player, affirmed
its earnings and revenue outlook for the year, it said costs to
launch its namesake brand in Canada and improve some other chains
would hurt its fiscal second quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Best Buy and Richmond, Va.-based Circuit City said growing demand
for home entertainment products such as DVD players, video games and
big-screen TVs helped drive up sales in the latest quarter.</LD>
<TE>   Best Buy reported fiscal first-quarter earnings of $70 million, or
22 cents a share, up from $55 million, or 17 cents, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Circuit City, which has been struggling to overhaul its business
after stopping sales of home appliances in November 2000, reported
fiscal first-quarter net income of $27.9 million, or 8 cents a share,
up from $16.9 million, or 5 cents.</TE>
<TE>   The consumer electronics business has been on the boil since the
Sept. 11 attacks led many people to cut down on activities such as
travel and instead focus on making their homes more comfortable.</TE>
<TE>   But much of Circuit City's and Best Buy's gains in the latest
quarter were due to aggressive price cuts and promotions aimed at
customers in danger of defecting to mass merchants such as Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., which have beefed up their consumer electronics.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Best Buy, which operates more than 1,900 stores, ended
down $3.25 at $39.01 on the New York Stock Exchange. Circuit City
closed 30 cents lower at $21.10 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   "The second half of this year could be really competitive from a
pricing standpoint and lead to a possible earnings shortfall," said
Midwest Research analyst Todd Kuhrt.</TE>
<TE>   Circuit City said that excluding its 64% interest in used-auto
retailer CarMax Inc., the company's consumer electronics store
business had a loss of $1.3 million, or 1 cent a share, compared with
$9.6 million, or 5 cents, a year earlier. Still, the loss was
narrower than expected, thanks to sales gains and cost control.</TE>
<TE>   Circuit City, which is revamping about half of its 620 stores,
said it viewed an aggressive promotional stance as a measure that
would benefit its business in the long run.</TE>
<TE>   Circuit City, whose shares year to date are off 18%, said it
promoted video game titles, CDs and DVDs that attracted repeat
customers in the first quarter. The stores also have used
interest-free financing pitch to attract buyers.</TE>
<TE>   For the second quarter, Best Buy said it expected earnings of 30
cents to 32 cents a share. Estimates by analysts polled by Thomson
First Call averaged 33 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Best Buy has been registering strong growth in almost
all of its merchandise segments, music sales are suffering from
Internet piracy.</TE>

<HD>Home Building Up 11.6% in May</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. housing starts surged last month at the fastest clip in nearly
seven years, while inflation proved tame, the government said Tuesday
in reports that give the Federal Reserve ample scope to delay raising
interest rates.</LD>
<LD>   The number of housing projects started in May rose an unexpectedly
large 11.6%, the biggest monthly gain in almost seven years and an
end to two straight months of declines, the Commerce Department said
in one of the few recent pieces of economic good news.</LD>
<LD>   "The housing market suggests the economic recovery is on track and
not as weak as the [stock] market perceives it to be," said Peter
Cardillo, chief strategist for Global Partners Securities.</LD>
<TE>   At the same time, consumer prices--a key measure of
inflation--were unchanged in May, according to a separate report,
leaving central bankers with virtually no worry of mounting price
pressures after bringing key interest rates down to 40-year lows when
the U.S. sank into recession.</TE>
<TE>   Economists expect the Fed now will wait several more months before
considering inflation-dampening rate hikes.</TE>
<TE>   The economic recovery has moved in fits and starts recently, and
policymakers are unlikely to want to tap the brakes until they are
sure the engine has solid forward momentum.</TE>
<TE>   "Inflation is not a threat at this point," said Gary Thayer, chief
economist at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. "Policymakers are
going to want to make sure the economic recovery is sustainable
before they raise rates."</TE>
<TE>   Consumer prices remained tightly reined last month, the Labor
Department said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Held down in part by declining energy and food prices, the
consumer price index--the most widely used inflation barometer--was
flat in May after a seasonally adjusted 0.5% rise a month earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI rose 0.2%
after gaining 0.3% in April.</TE>
<TE>   Groundbreaking for new homes jumped to a seasonally adjusted 1.73
million annual rate from a downwardly revised 1.55 million rate in
April, the biggest climb since July 1995, the Commerce Department
said.</TE>
<TE>   Single-family starts--the largest category of activity--jumped
9.6%, an increase also not matched since July 1995, the department
said.</TE>
<TE>   Many economists had believed last year's torrid pace of home
building was set to slow, but the sector has proved more resilient
than expected as mortgage rates have held below 7%, luring buyers.</TE>
<TE>   "With the ongoing gloom in the stock market, I just think the
perception of housing as a place to put your money has strengthened
so much. If you can do it, if you can finance it, you're going to
continue to get a lot of home building," said David Seiders, chief
economist for the National Assn. of Home Builders.</TE>

oversight board, and the SEC pushes parallel proposal.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Legislation to toughen rules for the accounting industry cleared a
key congressional hurdle Tuesday as federal regulators prepared to
move ahead with their own measure, giving fresh momentum to corporate
reforms inspired by Enron Corp.'s collapse.</LD>
<LD>   By a surprisingly strong 17-4 bipartisan vote, the Senate Banking
Committee approved an accounting industry reform bill that had
recently been given up for dead. The bill limits the amount of
consulting that accounting firms could provide to companies they
audit and creates a new oversight board with the power to discipline
auditors.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, the Securities and Exchange Commission prepared to
formally propose on Thursday a parallel measure by Chairman Harvey L.
Pitt that is tougher than many outsiders had expected.</LD>
<TE>   The dual efforts, coming on the heels of the conviction Saturday
of Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen, of obstruction of justice,
improves the prospects that Washington will take meaningful steps to
ensure that investors receive a fuller and more complete picture of
public companies' finances.</TE>
<TE>   Although Enron's descent into bankruptcy--and revelations of its
accounting irregularities--triggered numerous cries for action, the
push for reforms appeared to be waning amid business opposition.</TE>
<TE>   The bipartisan committee vote "considerably raises the odds of
President Bush having an accounting reform bill cross his desk before
the November election," said Robert Litan, economic studies director
for the Brookings Institution in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Still, difficult negotiations lie ahead. The Democratic-sponsored
bill passed Tuesday is tougher than an industry-backed measure
approved by the Republican-controlled House in April, and getting a
compromise is no sure thing in a closely divided Congress.</TE>
<TE>   But the reform bill authored by Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) may
be getting a boost from continuing allegations of crime in the
corporate world--including the indictment two weeks ago of Tyco
International Ltd.'s former chief executive on sales-tax evasion
charges and the arrest of ImClone Systems Inc.'s founder on
insider-trading charges.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) warned that corporate
responsibility will be an issue in the fall election "with or without
legislation."</TE>
<TE>   The Senate bill would create a five-member Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board, to be overseen by the SEC, to establish
auditing standards and ethics rules for auditors and to mete out
discipline. Two members must be accountants, but no more than two
could have an accounting background.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate bill also would establish new requirements for
financial disclosure by public companies, establish new rules to
prevent conflicts of interest by securities analysts and impose new
responsibilities on corporate officers. It also authorizes an
increase in the Securities and Exchange Commission budget, to $776
million in fiscal 2003, up from $481 million in Bush's proposed
budget.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), top Republican on the Senate Banking
Committee, voted against the measure, contending that Congress should
leave the details of accounting rules to the new oversight board.</TE>
<TE>   "If we are going to be setting up this independent panel, we ought
to let the panel set the standards as to what represents a conflict
of interest," Gramm said.</TE>
<TE>   Sarbanes, the committee chairman, worked with Sen. Mike Enzi
(R-Wyo.), an accountant, late into the evening Monday in an effort to
gain GOP support. Although the bill still puts limits on auditors
doing consulting work, it now allows the oversight board to make
exemptions on a case-by-case basis.</TE>
<TE>   The lucrative consulting fees Andersen received from its audit
client Enron were seen as a factor that prevented the firm from
aggressively challenging Enron's questionable accounting.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Basham, senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a Washington
think tank, said the Sarbanes bill received "so much support because
Senate Republicans have decided, three days after the Arthur Andersen
conviction, that it's time to waive the white flag on the accounting
portion of this debate."</TE>
<TE>   Frank Torres, legislative counsel for Consumers Union, said the
committee vote "reflects the lack of confidence among investors and
members of Congress that the SEC and the marketplace can get the job
done."</TE>
<TE>   Pitt is calling for a nine-member board that would have broad
powers to conduct investigations and discipline accounting firms.</TE>
<TE>   His proposed Public Accountability Board would include at least
six independent members not tied to the accounting industry--a key
issue with critics who fear that a panel stocked with accountants
would tilt toward the industry. The three industry representatives
would be blocked from voting on disciplinary matters.</TE>
<TE>   To ensure the board has authority to conduct thorough
investigations, his proposal would force accounting firms and public
companies to give their full cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   Companies and auditors also would have to finance the board's
operation through the payment of fees.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt's proposal would take effect in the event Congress fails to
pass a law establishing a similar oversight board.</TE>
<TE>   For Pitt, the call for a new accounting board has been a highly
charged political issue that has dogged him all year.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after broaching his original idea in January, the
industry's current monitor, the Public Oversight Board, abruptly
announced it would disband in protest. Although the POB was itself
blasted as being ineffectual, critics decried the fact that Pitt had
consulted with accounting-industry leaders before introducing his
idea.</TE>
<TE>   Critics said it showed that Pitt, a former securities lawyer who
represented big accounting firms, was beholden to the industry. He
has tried to shake that reputation.</TE>
<TE>   Although critics said Pitt's latest proposal has some flaws, they
nonetheless labeled it as far stricter than his first plan.</TE>
<TE>   "We see dramatic improvements in this proposal over what the SEC
chairman has said on this topic in the past," said Barbara Roper,
director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of
America. "We'll need to see the details, but in general it looks [to
be] a big improvement over the existing system."</TE>
<TE>   The proposals overlap in many areas, but there are differences.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Pitt's nine-member board would have no more than
three accountants, whereas Sarbanes envisions a five-person body with
up to two accountants.</TE>
<TE>   The nine-member plan would better insulate the board from the
accounting profession, Roper said. With five people, the industry
could hold sway if just one other member is sympathetic to its
position, she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Lynn Turner, the SEC's former chief accountant who is now a
college professor, was unimpressed with Pitt's proposal. It contains
various loopholes, such as that the board would work part-time,
Turner said.</TE>
<TE>   "Pitt's proposal is improved over what he put forth in January,
but it's still a weak proposal."</TE>

<HD>Gasoline Prices Likely to Keep Rising</HD>
<DH>Energy: Increases are expected through long July 4 weekend.
Rates in Southland are outpacing rest of nation.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gasoline prices in Southern California are edging up again and are
expected to keep rising in advance of the long Fourth of July
weekend.</LD>
<LD>   At the pump, the average price in the Los Angeles-Long Beach area
for a gallon of regular gasoline was $1.617 on Tuesday, up from
$1.589 on Monday, according to the Automobile Club of Southern
California's survey of 2,800 stations.</LD>
<LD>   A weekly survey by the U.S. Energy Information Administration also
charted the increase, saying the average price in Los Angeles for a
gallon of regular gas Monday was $1.574, up 4.1 cents from a week
ago.</LD>
<TE>   And gasoline prices in California are expected to increase an
additional 5 cents to 7 cents in the next two weeks, said Will Woods,
executive director of the Automotive Trade Organizations of
California.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's every indication that the prices will creep up
all the way through Fourth of July," Woods said. "Right now, we're
seeing a slow, steady increase."</TE>
<TE>   The increase is being blamed in part on a refinery outage,
shrinking inventories and expectations of heavy automobile travel
during what will be a four-day weekend for many Americans. Wholesale
gasoline prices on the Los Angeles spot market hit a nine-month high
of $1 a gallon last week, although prices ebbed to 95.5 cents on
Tuesday, according to Bloomberg's gasoline price survey.</TE>
<TE>   A Valero Energy Corp. refinery in Benicia, Calif., had a power
outage about two weeks ago that was expected to reduce a hydrogen
unit's output for a month, cutting its production of the special
lower-emission gasoline required in California from full capacity of
120,000 barrels a day to less than 90,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Here in California, we have such a sensitive infrastructure
between all the refiners. If one of them breaks down, the whole
system sort of takes a hit," said Bob van der Valk, bulk fuels
manager at Cosby Oil Co., an independent fuel distributor in Santa Fe
Springs.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been kind of a lull for the last two months, but the lull
is over," Van der Valk said.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, gasoline prices are stable. The average retail price
was $1.378 on Monday, up 0.3 cent from a week earlier, according to
the latest government data.</TE>
<TE>   The reformulated gasoline California requires keeps the market
isolated, and gasoline retailers said less refinery competition keeps
gasoline prices higher in the state compared with the rest of the
country.</TE>
<TE>   The Energy Information Administration has predicted a strong
travel season this summer. Experts in the travel industry expect more
travelers to opt for driving rather than flying to vacation
destinations, which could mean high demand for gasoline.</TE>
<TE>   The agency projects record gasoline demand of 8.88 million barrels
a day as the economy gradually accelerates this summer, up 1.6% from
last summer.</TE>
<TE>   But motorists can take heart in predictions that prices won't hit
levels as high as in the last two summers. Average prices in the Los
Angeles-Long Beach area hit a record high of $2.036 on May 25 last
year, the Automobile Club said.</TE>
<TE>   "No one's expecting huge spikes this summer," said Energy
Information Administration analyst David Costello. "Nationally, we
have a pretty good supply of gasoline."</TE>

<HD>Court Rejects Patent Deal Between Inamed, J&amp;J Unit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Inamed Corp. said Tuesday that a U.S. District Court rejected an
agreement the company and a Johnson &amp; Johnson unit made in 2000 to
settle a patent dispute over Inamed's "Lap-Band" obesity treatment.</LD>
<LD>   The patent and royalty dispute now moves to the pretrial discovery
phase, said Peter Nicholson, a spokesman for Inamed. The company said
it would appeal.</LD>
<LD>   The court determined that the 2000 agreement Inamed made with Dr.
Lubomyr Kuzmak, who holds patents he says cover the Lap-Band's
technology, was unenforceable. Kuzmak later sold some of his patent
rights to Ethicon, a Johnson &amp; Johnson unit, Nicholson said.</LD>
<TE>   "We think there are very strong grounds for appeal," Nicholson
said. "At the same time we are vigorously pursuing the patent
litigation" to challenge Kuzmak's intellectual property rights, he
added.</TE>
<TE>   The Food and Drug Administration approved the Lap-Band last year.
The obesity device is an inflatable band looped around the upper
stomach during minimally invasive surgery.</TE>
<TE>   The company collaborated with Kuzmak while it was researching
obesity treatments and both Kuzmak and Inamed have filed patents they
say pertain to the Lap-Band device, Nicholson said.</TE>
<TE>   Lap-Band sales for the second half of 2001 were about $3.6 million
in the U.S., Nicholson said.</TE>
<TE>   Inamed sells the device to doctors for about $3,000. Under the
agreement rejected by the court, the company would pay Kuzmak or
Ethicon about $36 for each model sold, Nicholson said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of the Santa Barbara-based maker of breast implants and
other plastic-surgery products closed off 95 cents at $30.23 on
Nasdaq. The company announced the decision after U.S. markets closed.</TE>

<HD>Getting Burned on Insurance</HD>
<DH>Policyholders may lack adequate coverage for this fire
season</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What's shaping up as the worst wildfire season in years comes as
property insurers, already stung by higher claims and lower
investment earnings, are raising premiums and restricting policies.</LD>
<LD>   With that as a backdrop and construction costs and home prices up
sharply in recent years, experts urge homeowners to check their
policies to be sure they have adequate coverage. Many never do so,
either to keep from pushing their premiums still higher or simply
through neglect.</LD>
<LD>   "About two-thirds of policyholders are underinsured," said Robert
P. Hartwig, chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute,
an industry-funded organization. "They bought a house five or 10
years ago and never updated their coverage, while the cost to rebuild
goes up 25%, 30% or even 50%."</LD>
<TE>   Insurers and consumer groups advise homeowners to review fire
coverage terms carefully, noting that today's policies are far less
likely than in the past to allow large cost overruns or pay for
unusual materials and details.</TE>
<TE>   Insurers "have been whittling away at coverage for years. And the
courts have largely allowed them to deny claims based on the new
exclusions," said Amy Bach of United Policyholders, a group that
worked closely with victims of the devastating 1991 Oakland Hills
fire.</TE>
<TE>   Before summer has even officially begun, insurers already have
flown in emergency teams to help fire victims in Colorado and
temporarily have stopped writing new policies and upgrading old ones
near raging wildfires there.</TE>
<TE>   By Tuesday, more than 156,000 acres had burned in Colorado.
According to a spokeswoman for state regulators there, uninsured
homeowners were besieging insurance agents near the fires, but new
coverage was unavailable.</TE>
<TE>   "If you wait until you're sick, you're not going to get
insurance," said Gary Litchenberg, a Farmers Insurance Group agent in
Woodland Park, 65 miles south of Denver.</TE>
<TE>   As disasters go, fire is a lesser threat to insurers than
hurricanes and earthquakes. Since 1981, fire claims constituted only
2.9% of what the industry calls "catastrophic losses," single events
with insured losses topping $25 million. Indeed, the only fire among
the top 10 catastrophes was the Oakland Hills conflagration, which
caused $1.7 billion in insured claims.</TE>
<TE>   Despite recent complaints of tough financial times, insurers say
they should be able to pay all claims, even if the fire season is as
severe as feared.</TE>
<TE>   "We're confident and secure in our ability to handle what comes
down the pike," said Bill Sirola of State Farm Insurance Cos. His
company recently stopped taking on new homeowner business in
California, citing rising claims, shrinking reserves and downgrades
to its financial-strength ratings.</TE>
<TE>   After a winter of scant rain and snow, a terrible fire season
appears likely across much of the nation. According to the National
Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, the 1.5 million acres burned
this year nearly double the 10-year average for this time of year.</TE>
<TE>   In California, three firefighters died in an air tanker crash near
Yosemite National Park on Monday, and hundreds of people fled as
another fire leaped across Interstate 15 north of San Bernardino.</TE>
<TE>   Tests on brush reveal "material down there in Southern California
that is drier than kiln-dried lumber," said Karen Terrill,
spokeswoman for the state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
She cited "unprecedented levels of drought" in San Diego, Riverside
and San Bernardino counties.</TE>
<TE>   That recalls the fall of 1993, when wildfires in the hills near
Altadena, Malibu and Laguna Beach destroyed hundreds of homes. One
positive note from those disasters was how quickly insurers brought
in emergency teams and began writing checks--policies brought on by
what Hartwig of the Insurance Information Institute acknowledged was
a "black eye" two years earlier in Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   That fire, which burned 2,900 structures, also was a wake-up call
to homeowners because so many were badly underinsured. After numerous
policyholders complained they hadn't been advised of coverage gaps
and were badly treated after the blaze, most insurers decided to pay
claims in full despite what the policies said.</TE>
<TE>   The experience taught insurers to routinely offer to review
policies and provide plain-language explanations to customers of what
is and isn't covered. That has helped educate policyholders who pay
attention, but also makes it tough for victims to complain after the
fact that they weren't informed.</TE>
<TE>   Since Oakland, Hartwig said, insurers have been more aggressive
about requiring homeowners to have fire-resistant roofs and siding
and to clear nearby brush.</TE>
<TE>   But those safety measures have been offset greatly as population
growth in the western United States puts more houses near
brush-covered hills and other danger zones, he said.</TE>
<TE>   To limit their exposure, most insurers also have done away with
"guaranteed replacement" clauses, instead capping payments at 20%
above the stated value of property, he said. And they have begun to
rate homes individually for ease of access by firefighters and
proximity to hills and fire fuel.</TE>
<TE>   "If you live on a dead-end street with a steep slope and you have
heavy brush all around it, you're going to pay a lot more" for
insurance, Hartwig said. "You may not get it at all unless you get
the brush cleared first."</TE>

<HD>Dow's Consecutive Rise First in Weeks; Tech Stocks Fall</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Economic data give hope, but Mideast violence and
an analyst's IBM report sour mood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Technology stocks slumped but the broader market was little changed
Tuesday as more violence erupted in the Middle East and a leading
brokerage cut its profit outlook for bellwether IBM, overshadowing
promising economic data.</LD>
<LD>   In currency trading the euro rose to a 17-month high against the
dollar.</LD>
<LD>   Stocks gyrated around the unchanged line most of the day after
another suicide bombing in Jerusalem unsettled investors who have
been hoping for geopolitical stability before they jump back into
stocks. Monday's big gains also spurred some selling as investors
locked in short-term profits.</LD>
<TE>   "It's one step forward, one half-step backward," said Gil Knight,
fund manager at Allied Investment Advisors. "There's not enough
direction to get investors excited."</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 18.70 points, or 0.2%,
at 9,706.12, for its first back-to-back winning sessions in more than
three weeks. The blue-chip index rose 213 points Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index inched up less than a
point, or 0.1%, to 1,037.14. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 10.33
points, or 0.7%, to 1,542.96. Nasdaq surged more than 3% on Monday,
its best one-day gain since May 14.</TE>
<TE>   Trading volume was moderate. Advancers led decliners by about 9 to
8 on the New York Stock Exchange, while losers finished ahead by
about 6 to 5 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Investors were heartened early in the day by data that pointed to
a recovering U.S. economy with little threat of inflation.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. housing starts jumped 11.6% in May, the biggest percentage
gain in almost seven years, while U.S. consumer prices were unchanged
in May. With inflation in check, the Federal Reserve has room to
delay interest-rate hikes and allow the economy to gain strength,
investors said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Fed is certainly on hold, and it will be so for the third
quarter--maybe even in the fourth quarter," Christopher Mahony, a
money manager at J&amp;W Selig- man &amp; Co., told Bloomberg News. "With no
inflation out there, some investors will go ahead and keep buying
Treasuries, especially two-year notes."</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the two-year Treasury note, among the securities most
sensitive to rate moves by the Fed, slipped to 2.88% from 2.91% on
Monday. Two-year notes also were buoyed by an announcement Monday
that the Treasury would postpone its next sale of the securities
until Congress lifts the ceiling on federal borrowing.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, speculation that prospects for corporate profit growth
are better in Europe helped fuel the euro's latest surge against the
dollar, rising 0.7 cent to 95.1 cents.</TE>
<TE>   On Wall Street, home-building stocks gained on the housing report.
The S&amp;P index of home builders added 2.9%, reflecting gains by Pulte
Homes, which climbed $1.73 to $54.29, and KB Home, which rose 99
cents to $49.37.</TE>
<TE>   But the upbeat economic data could not overshadow news of more
bloodshed in Jerusalem, where a Palestinian suicide bomber killed 19
people and wounded more than 50, adding to market jitters.</TE>
<TE>   The bombing "is one of the reasons the market opened down and
another reason why this rally is so muted," said Stephen Bliss,
co-head of Nasdaq trading at Cantor Fitzgerald.</TE>
<TE>   Among the day's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * IBM weighed on the Dow, falling $1.20 to $75.94. Analyst Rebecca
Runkle of Morgan Stanley lowered 2002 and 2003 earnings estimates for
the No. 1 computer maker because of continued weak spending on
hardware.</TE>
<TE>   * Other tech losers included Intel, down 54 cents to $22.02, and
THQ, off $1.52 to $30.45.</TE>
<TE>   After the market closed, Apple Computer and Advanced Micro Devices
issued profit warnings for the current quarter. Oracle reported lower
earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter and said first- quarter profit
would miss forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   Many bank stocks advanced for a second day. Citigroup rose 24
cents to $43.07, Bank of America added 64 cents to $74 and Washington
Mutual was up 70 cents to $37.65.</TE>

<HD>Latinos Focus of Housing Effort</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Wells Fargo, National Council of La Raza will
work together to boost home buying in Southland, elsewhere in U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wells Fargo Home Mortgage Inc. and National Council of La Raza said
Tuesday that they would join to encourage home buying among Latinos
in nearly 20 metropolitan areas across the U.S., including Southern
California.</LD>
<LD>   Wells Fargo will provide bilingual loan counselors, educational
materials written in Spanish and seminars that explain how to become
a homeowner.</LD>
<LD>   Wells Fargo branches in Southern California will work through
affiliates of La Raza, the nation's largest civil rights group for
Latinos, to locate potential home buyers. Affiliates include Watts
Century Latino Organization in L.A. and Cabrillo Economic Development
Corp. in Ventura.</LD>
<TE>   "In the past, lenders focused on [the Latino] market because of
regulatory reasons," said Jackson Cosey, senior vice president at
Wells Fargo. "But from our perspective, we see this as a real
business opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   The announcement came a day after President Bush described plans
to provide lower-cost housing and boost homeownership among
minorities. Although about three out of four whites own houses, the
latest U.S. figures show less than half of Latinos and African
Americans hold title to a house.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, La Raza was one of several groups that
supported a home buyer education Web site by secondary mortgage
investor Freddie Mac at www.freddiemac.com/comprecasa.</TE>
<TE>   Fannie Mae, another mortgage investor, pledged Monday to buy $100
million in mortgages over the next three years from brokers who
belong to the National Assn. of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the market and economics and plain self-interest that's
motivating them," Raul Yzaguirre, president of La Raza, said of Wells
Fargo. "I think that's healthy."</TE>

<HD>Nonsmoker Wins Damages in Suit</HD>
<DH>Courts: The $5.5-million award to a flight attendant is the
tobacco industry's first loss in a secondhand-smoke case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRON LEVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The tobacco industry Tuesday suffered its first defeat in a
secondhand-smoke case when a Miami jury awarded $5.5 million to a
flight attendant who claimed she suffered sinus inflammation from
working in smoky airline cabins.</LD>
<LD>   The victory by Lynn French, 56, after a two-week trial was the
latest sign of juror anger at tobacco companies. The size of the
verdict was particularly striking because sinusitis is not a
life-threatening illness and French's lawyers had sought only $1
million in damages. The award was intended as compensation for past
and future pain and suffering, and French's fear of getting cancer.</LD>
<LD>   In statements issued after the verdict, Philip Morris USA and R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Co. said they would ask Miami-Dade Circuit Judge
Fredricka G. Smith to set aside the verdict, and failing that, would
appeal.</LD>
<TE>   "Credible evidence does not exist to show that secondhand smoke
causes chronic sinusitis in nonsmokers," said Daniel P. Donahue,
Reynolds' senior vice president and deputy general counsel.</TE>
<TE>   The jury deliberated 1 1/2 hours before finding the company and
co-defendants Lorillard Tobacco Co. and Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco
Corp. liable.</TE>
<TE>   French and her lawyers could not be reached for comment. But Ed
Sweda, a senior attorney with the Tobacco Products Liability Project,
a Boston-based group that promotes lawsuits against the industry,
said the verdict "will serve as a terrific educational tool for the
public to demonstrate that ... indeed secondhand smoke is a
significant hazard to nonsmokers."</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, secondhand smoke cases have not been considered
a major threat to cigarette makers because causation of illness is
hard to prove.</TE>
<TE>   But the industry still faces an additional 3,000 lawsuits by
flight attendants after a 1997 settlement of a nationwide class
action, known as the Broin case. The case was filed on behalf of
flight attendants claiming injuries from secondhand smoke. The
settlement involved payment by the industry of $349 million for legal
fees and health research.</TE>
<TE>   None of that money went to the flight attendants, but the
settlement set favorable ground rules for the airline workers to
pursue individual claims, including shifting the burden of proof to
tobacco companies to show that secondhand smoke was not responsible
for causing illnesses. The settlement barred flight attendants from
seeking punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   French's was the third Broin-aftermath case to go to trial. Last
June, another Miami jury sided with the defense in a case brought by
former flight attendant Marie J. Fontana, who suffered from
sarcoidosis, a severe lung disease. A second case ended in a mistrial
last month.</TE>
<TE>   More of the flight attendant claims are scheduled to be tried this
summer.</TE>
<TE>   Cigarette makers have complained that the Broin judge, Robert
Kaye, improperly set a trial plan for the individual cases that
barred the firms from raising certain defenses. This, they said,
gives them strong grounds to appeal.</TE>
<TE>   The jury in the French case returned its verdict after the stock
markets had closed. Philip Morris Cos. shares were unchanged at
$54.94, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Inc. fell 81 cents to $63.84,
and Loews Corp., parent of Lorillard Tobacco Co., rose 64 cents to
$56.47, all on the New York Stock Exchange. American depositary
receipts of British American Tobacco, parent of Brown &amp; Williamson,
gained 5 cents to $22.53 on the American Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Offshore Tax Havens Draw Fire</HD>
<DH>Legislation: A Senate panel votes to ban breaks to U.S.
firms that move their headquarters to such places as Bermuda.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RYAN J. DONMOYER</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- A Senate panel voted Tuesday to deny tax breaks sought
by U.S. firms that change their legal addresses to offshore tax
havens such as Bermuda.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate Finance Committee approved by voice vote a bill that
would, for tax purposes, treat companies that move as if they never
left.</LD>
<LD>   It's the first action by Congress to stop more such moves, which
companies such as Leucadia National Corp. and Stanley Works have said
would reduce their taxes to the level of their foreign competitors.
Many lawmakers criticized the "corporate inversions" as wrong at a
time when the U.S. is fighting a war against terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   "Allowing a few unpatriotic corporations to exploit tax havens
abroad is simply unfair to the American businesses with whom they
compete and to the taxpayer families who have to pick up the slack,"
said Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), who has sponsored similar
legislation in the House.</TE>
<TE>   The issue became more heated this month after former Tyco
International Chairman L. Dennis Kozlowski was indicted in New York
on charges of evading sales taxes. Kozlowski spearheaded the shift of
Tyco's headquarters to Bermuda in 1997 as a tax-saving move.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) said he
didn't know when the full Senate would consider the measure, which
was paired with $10.1 billion in tax incentives to boost charitable
giving. But when the bill does move to the floor, he said, "I do not
expect major opposition."</TE>
<TE>   The Finance Committee also approved new penalties for companies
and individuals that don't disclose their use of certain tax
shelters. The measure would expose investment banks and accounting
and law firms to stiffer fines for promoting or advising on tax
shelters found to violate the law.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate's attempt to stop companies from using offshore
addresses and other strategies to reduce--some say evade--U.S. taxes
sets up a fight with the House and the Bush administration, which
advocate better enforcement of existing laws and say the problem is
rooted in a flawed U.S. tax code.</TE>
<TE>   The committee's approval comes four days after shareholders of oil
well driller Nabors Industries Inc. backed a headquarters move to
Bermuda. Insurance firm Leucadia's shareholders this month also
approved a move to that island; tool maker Stanley Works will hold a
revote of its move proposal after Connecticut state officials
challenged the results of a May 9 shareholder vote.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Duda, a spokesman for Stanley Works, said the company
opposed the Finance Committee's bill because it "does not address the
competitiveness issue."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John B. Breaux (D-La.) said the Senate would not act quickly
on the tax-saving ban. "This is not the highest priority," he said,
citing other issues pending in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate bill seeks to disrupt the plans of at least four
companies that are in the process of moving to Bermuda or another tax
haven such as the Cayman Islands or Luxembourg. They include Nabors
and its competitor Weatherford International Inc., as well as
Leucadia and Stanley Works.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would treat companies that set up "shell" headquarters in
other nations as U.S. firms for tax purposes. The measure also would
retroactively deny tax benefits to at least three other companies
that have acted since March 20, the proposed effective date. They
include Cooper Industries, Noble Drilling Corp. and the consulting
arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers.</TE>

<HD>O'Neill Urges CEOs to Criticize Unethical Peers</HD>
<DH>Corporations: Treasury secretary says leaders must speak
out against abuses that harm public and investor confidence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said company chief executives
ought to castigate any peers whose actions weaken public and investor
confidence.</LD>
<LD>   Leaders "should get on the tabletop and scream out against the
abuses that have been done and make it clear this is not how we view
life, this is not what we think is responsible behavior, and we don't
like it any better than anyone else," O'Neill said Tuesday at a
conference sponsored by AOL Time Warner Inc.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neill, a former chairman of Alcoa Inc., did not single out
individuals or companies. He has been the administration's chief
critic of management transgressions at firms such as Adelphia
Communications Corp. and Enron Corp.</LD>
<TE>   There is no legislative "silver bullet" that will prevent CEOs
from hiding information from shareholders, O'Neill said.</TE>
<TE>   "It frankly never would've occurred to me to say there's something
big going on in my company and I don't know about it," he said, an
apparent reference to Enron executives' claims that they were unaware
of alleged financial wrongdoing at the company. "What kind of
integrity is that?" O'Neill said.</TE>
<TE>   Government and industry regulators are taking steps to curb
abuses, O'Neill said, noting that all 10 of President Bush's
recommendations to tighten corporate oversight are "in motion or have
been put in place."</TE>
<TE>   During another appearance, before Treasury securities investors,
O'Neill spoke further about what he called isolated breaches of
corporate accountability.</TE>
<TE>   He joked about the extent of punishment he would like to impose on
deceptive CEOs: "What they really ought to wear around their neck
would transport them to a branch on the highest tree, not the mantle
of leadership."</TE>

<HD>Tech Firms' Reports Are Worse Than Anticipated</HD>
<DH>Earnings: Lower profit, sales at Oracle and reduced
expectations by Apple and AMD show spending still slow.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three of California's biggest and best-known technology firms gave
unexpectedly negative financial reports late Tuesday, showing that
spending on high-tech products is recovering more slowly than
investors had hoped.</LD>
<LD>   Software giant Oracle Corp. reported dramatically lower
fourth-quarter profit and sales as it had warned it would, but added
that the quarter just begun would be even worse than analysts were
expecting.</LD>
<LD>   Chip maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. said it would miss sales
forecasts and post a substantial operating loss in the second
quarter. And Apple Computer Inc. said sales and profit in its fiscal
third quarter would be lower than expected.</LD>
<TE>   The reports served as a grim reminder that, despite some signs in
recent weeks that the technology slump may be bottoming out, demand
for hardware and software remains weak.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are still tough, and it doesn't look like it will be much
different in the summer months," said analyst Jason Maynard of
Wachovia Securities.</TE>
<TE>   Gains in the broader economy might not translate into increased
tech spending for six months, Oracle Chief Financial Officer Jeff
Henley warned investors during a conference call.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect to see a tough environment that will continue," Henley
said. He predicted that the maker of database programs would earn 6
cents or 7 cents a share in the quarter just begun, shy of Wall
Street's average estimate of 9 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   In the quarter ended May 31, Oracle's net income fell to $656
million, or 12 cents a share, from $855 million, or 15 cents, a year
earlier. Sales dropped 16% to $2.77 billion, ending the first year of
falling revenue in the company's 25-year history.</TE>
<TE>   Although sales in the most recent period beat estimates, "I don't
think Oracle's quarter is an indication of an immediate rebound,"
Maynard said.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle shares, which fell 27 cents to $8.93 in regular Nasdaq
trading, surged to $9.95 in after-hours trading on the
greater-than-expected revenue for the quarter just ended. The price
then fell back to $9.27 after the Redwood City, Calif.-based firm
lowered its projections for the coming quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Advanced Micro, the second-largest maker of semiconductors behind
Intel Corp., said revenue for the period ending June 30 is expected
to be $620 million to $700 million. In April, it expected sales of
$820 million to $900 million. Analysts were expecting second-quarter
revenue of $841 million and a net loss of 9 cents a share, according
to Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   AMD said sales in its processor business, particularly in Europe
and North America, are weak. Sales of its flash memory is improving.</TE>
<TE>   AMD said its research and development spending remains at record
levels and its product release plans remain on schedule. Earlier this
month, Intel warned that its sales would be lower than expected.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Sunnyvale, Calif.-based AMD lost 50 cents to close at
$10.30 on the New York Stock Exchange. After the warning was
released, shares lost $1.57, or 15%.</TE>
<TE>   Apple said revenue in its third quarter ending June 30 would range
from $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion, down some 10% from its previous
forecast of about $1.6 billion. Earnings per share are expected to be
8 cents to 10 cents, compared with a previous estimate of 11 cents or
slightly higher. Analysts were projecting earnings of 13 cents a
share on revenue of $1.6 billion, according to a survey by Thomson
First Call.</TE>
<TE>   The computer maker said the lower-than-expected sales are due to
soft demand in the consumer and creative markets. Revenue in Europe
and Japan is particularly weak, Apple said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple fell 39 cents to $20.15 in
regular Nasdaq trading. Apple issued the warning after the market
closed, sending shares down $1.68 to $18.47.</TE>

<HD>Peregrine to Fire 1,400 Employees</HD>
<DH>Technology: The cuts, expected over the next few weeks,
come amid a probe into the software firm's accounting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. HUFFSTUTTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Peregrine Systems Inc. will fire nearly half its work force as the
maker of business software struggles to recover from two years of
losses and a federal investigation into its accounting.</LD>
<LD>   The 1,400 job cuts, expected over the next few weeks, are among
the first actions of Chief Executive Gary Greenfield, who took over
the company this month.</LD>
<LD>   The layoffs will affect its San Diego headquarters, as well as
facilities in Indianapolis; Huntsville, Ala.; and Orlando, Fla.</LD>
<TE>   Peregrine shares, which Tuesday rose 4 cents to close at $1.20 on
Nasdaq, have been in a nose dive since the company said it may have
overstated as much as $100 million in revenue over the last three
years. Its continuing troubles have led to several shareholder
lawsuits alleging that the company misled investors about its
financial health.</TE>
<TE>   Greenfield said that Peregrine will have enough cash to deal with
the suits, and that the layoffs will give the company enough
breathing room to survive.</TE>
<TE>   "These actions will have minimal impact on our customers and the
level of services and support we offer," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts scoffed at such sentiments.</TE>
<TE>   "That's ridiculous. It's totally not true," said Mike Trigg of
Morningstar Inc. "Peregrine will continue to exist, but it's going to
exist in a totally different form."</TE>
<TE>   What remains is expected to be a slimmed-down version of the
once-aggressive e-commerce business, which started out by making
software that tracks a company's technical infrastructure. By 1998,
the company had begun to branch out and went on a buying spree,
picking up 12 companies over four years and spending billions of
dollars in the process.</TE>
<TE>   The company now wants to either spin off or sell many of these
businesses. Its core focus would remain its tracking software, which
customers use to manage technology resources and other assets, and
its call-center business, which it bought last year in a stock deal,
then valued at $1 billion, according to analysts.</TE>
<TE>   In April, the company fired Arthur Andersen as its auditor and
hired KPMG.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, KPMG found inflated revenue problems, and Peregrine
said it would erase nearly $100 million in sales from the last three
years--particularly revenue from software deals made through
partners, consultants and retailers if a product was returned.</TE>
<TE>   Such indirect sales account for about 40% of Peregrine's revenue,
according to company officials.</TE>
<TE>   Peregrine eventually fired KPMG, saying that $35 million in
revenue that had to be restated was drawn from sales through KPMG's
former consulting unit. Peregrine said keeping KPMG, which had spun
off its consulting arm in 2001, would clash with U.S. auditor
independence rules.</TE>
<TE>   KPMG, which insisted it didn't know about the sales until after it
was hired, sent a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission
alleging that Peregrine possibly had committed fraud. In late May,
the SEC launched a formal probe into the company's accounting
practices.</TE>
<TE>   In the midst of this, Steve Gardner stepped down as board chairman
and chief executive, and Matt Gless resigned as chief financial
officer and executive vice president of finance.</TE>
<TE>   Greenfield, formerly president and CEO of the e-business
development company Merant, replaced Gardner as chief executive. John
Moores, owner of the San Diego Padres, took over as chairman.</TE>
<TE>   The company also was linked to an accounting scandal involving
e-mail provider Critical Path Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC found that San Francisco-based Critical Path committed
fraud to reach revenue targets. One of the ways it did so, according
to court documents, was through a "software swap" with Peregrine,
where the president of Critical Path once worked.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The California Power Authority announced a program Tuesday to pay
large industrial power users to cut consumption. Those customers will
be paid less than the cost for actual electricity.</LD>
<LD>   The program has several advantages over building new power plants,
said Power Authority Chief Executive Laura Doll, and companies won't
have to shut down completely to meet their obligation.</LD>
<LD>   The program will rely on satellite technology and real-time
electric meters to dim air conditioners or lights automatically when
the state's power buyers call on the companies.</LD>
<TE>   "This is cheaper, and it's quicker," said S. David Freeman,
chairman of the California Power Authority.</TE>
<TE>   The Power Authority estimates the program will cost $7 million
this year, and will be able to call on as much as 250 megawatts of
energy. One megawatt is approximately enough energy to operate 750
homes.</TE>
<TE>   APX Inc., an energy scheduling company, will be paid $750,000 this
year to administer the program. As more power users are enrolled,
APX's fee will rise to about $2 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   The California program is similar to ones offered in other states,
except that California power traders won't have to wait until
reserves are low to call on the conservation measures, said John
Yurkanin, APX's chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Companies that sign up for the program will get a monthly reserve
payment, Doll said, and next year, they also will get paid for the
energy they save.</TE>

<LD>A Los Angeles judge Tuesday said he wanted to reconsider an
independent auditor's report that Walt Disney Co. had almost fully
paid for rights to the Winnie the Pooh character despite a licensor's
allegations of millions of dollars in underpayments. In his tentative
ruling, Superior Court Judge Ernest Hiroshige questioned the finding
that Disney owed Stephen Slesinger Inc. just $11,000 in royalties
stemming from a 1983 licensing agreement, Slesinger attorney Bonnie
Eskenazi said. Disney's lead attorney called Hiroshige's tentative
ruling "a split decision" and said Disney was ready to argue its case
yet again.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Gillette Co. was told by a jury to pay $10 million to Syndia Corp.
for infringing patents covering a method for coating razor blades
with diamond-like carbon to make them stronger.</LD>
<LD>   Syndia said it may seek a court order blocking Gillette from
selling its Mach3, Mach3 Turbo and Venus razor blades because of the
patent-infringement finding unless Gillette signs a licensing
agreement with the Chicago-based company. Boston-based Gillette said
it will seek to overturn the jury's finding and appeal the case if
necessary.</LD>

<LD>Just before closing arguments in its antitrust case, Microsoft Corp.
delivered a broadside to one of its bitter software rivals, declaring
it will stop supporting Sun Microsystems' flagship product by 2004.</LD>
<LD>   Microsoft cited Sun's opposition in the case as the reason for the
decision to remove support for Sun's Java programming language from
future versions of Microsoft's Windows operating system.</LD>
<LD>   Current versions of Windows XP do not include Java, though users
can download it. But Microsoft did say it would temporarily restore
support for Java in the update to Windows XP this fall.</LD>

<LD>Archer Daniels Midland Co., Cargill Inc. and two other makers of corn
sweeteners must face a trial over claims that they colluded to fix
prices, after a federal appeals court revived a 7-year-old case that
had been dismissed in August.</LD>
<LD>   PepsiCo Inc., Coca-Cola Co. and 24 other food and beverage
companies had sued the sweetener producers, saying that in 1988 they
colluded to fix the price of high-fructose corn syrup.</LD>
<LD>   Executives at Archer Daniels and Wayzata, Minn.-based Cargill
didn't return calls seeking comment. Shares of Archer Daniels fell 15
cents to $13.74 on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>

<LD>UAL Corp.'s United Airlines said it will cut the salaries of
executives and nonunion administrators to save $430 million over
three years as the world's second-largest carrier prepares to seek a
government loan guarantee.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Executive Jack Creighton will continue to forgo his salary.</LD>
<LD>   The pay cuts will affect 11,100 employees, or about 13% of the
company's work force. UAL said if a "substantial number" of workers
agree to concessions it will apply for a loan guarantee under a
federal aid program set up last year after the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>

<LD>Legislators turned to a parliamentary maneuver to resuscitate a bill
that seeks to stop California's $41-billion recording industry from
locking singers into contracts for long stretches of their careers.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate Judiciary Committee converted the bill, already three
weeks past its legislative deadline to reach the Senate floor or die,
into a special legislation device called a "spot" bill. The procedure
keeps the bill's idea alive while the record industry and its biggest
artists try to resolve an issue that's divided them for months.</LD>

<HD>Harnessing Collective Annoyance to Fight Spam</HD>
<DH>Internet: As the torrent of unsolicited e-mails rises, some
see growing public anger as a way to stem it. One new tool even lets
users vote mail off the system.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Just when a new area of hyper-growth on the beleaguered Internet
finally is taking off, some people are spending millions of dollars
and banding together to snuff it out.</LD>
<LD>   It seems some folks just don't want to have unlimited income,
bigger breasts and all-you-can-eat Viagra.</LD>
<LD>   So far, they are losing the fight: The number of unsolicited
e-mails known as spam is increasing faster than ever, by as much as
500% in the last year. And a business with 500 employees can expect
to waste $40,000 in workers' time annually, research firms say.</LD>
<TE>   But the anti-spam forces are spending more and more on the
problem, and some innovative ideas are harnessing collective
annoyance in a way that could change the balance.</TE>
<TE>   One of the new collaborative proselytizers, San Francisco start-up
Cloudmark Inc., today is releasing a free tool for users of Microsoft
Corp.'s Outlook e-mail system that allows them to vote on what's
spam. If enough users designate a piece of mail as spam, Cloudmark
will stop it from reaching everyone's primary mailbox, instead
sending it to a spam folder.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds promising," said John Patrick, a former IBM Corp. vice
president who chairs the Global Internet Project, which is pushing
for standards that would work on all e-mail systems.</TE>
<TE>   Other grass-roots efforts have proved difficult to use, Patrick
said. But Cloudmark Chief Executive Karl Jacob said his company's
SpamNet system requires only the same single mouse click that
deleting the offending e-mail would. Cloudmark plans to earn money
later by selling a version of SpamNet to companies.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest anti-spam vendor is San Francisco's Brightmail Inc., a
venture-funded operation that sells to six of the top 10 Internet
service providers and to companies such as Cypress Semiconductor
Corp. of San Jose. Brightmail has about 45% of the $88-million market
but doesn't offer a consumer version.</TE>
<TE>   Brightmail uses dummy e-mail addresses to attract spam, then
writes rules to block those e-mails from reaching real people. Dennis
Bell, Cypress' director of technical operations, said Brightmail has
paid for itself by wiping out 90% of Cypress employees' spam without
blocking any legitimate e-mails. But Bell and others said that if
they found something better, they would use it.</TE>
<TE>   Because the spam-hurlers are getting more clever, Cloudmark
founder and Chief Technology Officer Jordan Ritter says that mass
public participation will be able to keep pace better than
Brightmail's human rule writers.</TE>
<TE>   Combined with a system for evaluating how similar a definite piece
of spam is to a suspected piece of spam, Cloudmark should be able to
eliminate 99% of the bad stuff, said Ritter, a founding developer of
Napster Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The system makes sense to such analysts as Michael Osterman, whose
Osterman Research has been tracking spam.</TE>
<TE>   "The approach is a very sound one," Osterman said. "The only risk
is, will they get enough users?"</TE>
<TE>   Given the growing anger over spam, the firm at least has a
receptive audience to work with. Its system takes a lot less effort
than the approach endorsed by some independent spam militants, who
have gone so far as to call a spammer's toll-free phone number and
leave the phone number of another spammer for the first to call back,
wasting the time and money of two culprits with a single call.</TE>

<HD>Reform Bill Won't Curb State Securities Regulation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The new Senate legislation that would tighten accounting-industry
oversight will not contain a controversial proposed amendment that
could have stripped state regulators of much of their power to pursue
securities industry abuses.</LD>
<LD>   The amendment, backed by industry giant Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
&amp; Co., failed to find a sponsor.</LD>
<LD>   "The language did not make it in, but we will still be vigilant,"
said Ashley Baker, spokesman for the North American Securities
Administrators Assn., which vehemently opposed the amendment. The
group represents state securities regulators.</LD>
<TE>   NASAA portrayed the amendment as Wall Street's attempt to defang
the states at a time when they are spearheading some of the most
aggressive securities-law enforcement actions--such as New York Atty.
Gen. Eliot Spitzer's recent $100-million settlement with Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co., forcing the firm to revamp its stock research practices
after allegations that analysts gave tainted advice.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate bill, passed by the Banking Committee on Tuesday, still
faces a full Senate vote and a conference-committee session to iron
out differences with House legislation. If the amendment resurfaces
at any stage, NASAA again will fight it, Baker said.</TE>
<TE>   On its face, the language of the proposed amendment was sweeping:
It said "no law, rule, regulation, order or other administrative
action, or any judgment, consent order or settlement agreement, shall
be imposed or entered into under or pursuant to the laws of any state
or political subdivision thereof" in cases in which the Securities
and Exchange Commission already had jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan Stanley attempted to play down the scope of the proposal,
saying it was meant to apply only to regulation of research analysts.
"We would favor language that is narrowly focused on preserving
uniform national regulatory standards for securities research," the
brokerage said in a statement Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   NASAA's Baker said the language, as written, was so broad, a
defense lawyer for a securities firm could use it to try to strike
down almost any kind of state enforcement action involving
SEC-regulated individuals or firms, in effect gutting state
securities laws.</TE>

<HD>Tenet's $55.8-Million Payment Settles Claims</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tenet Healthcare Corp., the second-biggest U.S. hospital chain, will
pay $55.8 million to settle several allegations of Medicare fraud,
including a whistle-blower lawsuit claiming that Tenet's Brotman
Medical Center in Culver City filed false cost reports.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Barbara-based company took reserves for the settlement
before Feb. 28, the end of its fiscal third quarter, Tenet said.</LD>
<LD>   Tenet's settlement is the latest in a series involving hospitals
that overbilled Medicare. The top hospital chain, HCA Inc., and
Quorum Health Group Inc., now part of Triad Hospitals Inc., in recent
months have reached multimillion-dollar settlements with the
government.</LD>
<TE>   "These settlements mean the hospitals are giving money back to the
Medicare program that was improperly taken," said San Francisco
lawyer Mary A. Inman of Phillips &amp; Cohen.</TE>
<TE>   The law firm represented the whistle-blower William Noll in the
1998 lawsuit against Brotman. Noll, Brotman's former controller, will
receive as much as 30% of the $9.75 million that Brotman will pay to
settle the matter. Tenet acquired Brotman from OrNda Corp. in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet also said Tuesday that it will pay $17 million to resolve
allegations that its hospitals overcharged Medicare and other
government health-care programs for laboratory services.</TE>
<TE>   And in a third settlement that was packaged in Tuesday's
announcement, Tenet said it will pay $29 million in a case that
accused Palmetto General Hospital in Florida of billing and
cost-report violations for home health services once operated by that
hospital. Tenet acquired Palmetto General in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   The bond-rating firm Standard &amp; Poor's, noting that the total
settlements Tuesday are small compared with Tenet's cash flow, said
there is no effect on the ratings or outlook for Tenet's bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Tenet rose $1.84 to $76.54 on the New York Stock
Exchange. The stock has gained 30% this year.</TE>

<HD>TRW Says Goodrich to Buy Aircraft Unit</HD>
<DH>Deals: The $1.5-billion sale could be an effort to fend off
Northrop's takeover bid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>TRW Inc., an acquisition target of Northrop Grumman Corp., said late
Tuesday that it had reached a tentative agreement to sell its
aircraft-parts business to Goodrich Corp. for $1.5 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The anticipated sale is part of a breakup plan TRW devised shortly
after Century City-based Northrop proposed acquiring the company with
a price tag that has been sweetened to $6.7 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Northrop, in its acquisition proposal, has said it would sell
TRW's aircraft parts as well as the automobile parts businesses while
keeping the company's core and more lucrative defense electronics and
military satellite operations.</LD>
<TE>   It wasn't clear immediately if the sale would strengthen TRW's
efforts to fend off Northrop's bid. TRW said late Tuesday that it
would use the proceeds to pay down its high debt level, which has
hurt its bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop has maintained that buying TRW without both the aircraft
and auto parts businesses, which have been a drain on TRW's earnings,
would enhance its ability to acquire TRW.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop is conducting due diligence of TRW's financial documents
in hopes of coming up with a friendly deal.</TE>
<TE>   For Goodrich, the acquisition would strengthen its position in the
commercial and military aerospace business.</TE>
<TE>   Goodrich has significant presence in Southern California. It
employs about 2,000 people in Chula Vista, where it makes aircraft
engine parts, and has about 700 employees in Riverside, where it
makes wing and flight controls.</TE>
<TE>   Goodrich said it planned to finance the acquisition, which was
seen closing in the fourth quarter, with a combination of debt and
equity-linked securities.</TE>
<TE>   TRW said it would report the aircraft-parts business, Aeronautical
Systems, as a discontinued operation and anticipated second-quarter
earnings per share from continuing operations of 98 cents to $1,
excluding unusual items.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very pleased with the successful sale of our Aeronautical
Systems business," TRW Chairman Philip A. Odeen said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The unit, which has about 6,200 employees, had sales of $1.1
billion in 2001. It is based in Solihull, England, and has
manufacturing facilities and other operations in nine countries. TRW
had sales of $16 billion last year.</TE>

<HD>Forecast Sees Slow but Steady Recovery</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UCLA business forecasters predict sluggish economic growth for the
remainder of the year but see no evidence of a second recessionary
dip.</LD>
<LD>   Recent data showing flagging consumer confidence and a slowdown in
retail spending have heightened nervousness that the recovery will
falter. But the quarterly UCLA Anderson Forecast being released today
says that barring some unexpected shock, the U.S. and California
economies should continue their slow but steady rebound.</LD>
<LD>   "This isn't a particularly strong expansion, but it looks to be
sustainable," said Tom Lieser, senior economist with the UCLA
Anderson Forecast.</LD>
<TE>   "Interest rates are low. Unemployment is low [compared with the
recession in the early 1990s]. We have some pretty good underpinnings
at this point," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The forecast says that rapid appreciation in Southern California
real estate prices doesn't yet constitute a "bubble," but that Bay
Area home values look too high given continued weakness in the tech
economy.</TE>
<TE>   In April, median home prices in the Bay Area hit a record
$402,000, according to DataQuick Information Systems, even as the
region continues to lose jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously there are a lot of people up there placing a big bet on
an early bounce-back in the tech sector," said Edward E. Leamer,
director of the UCLA Anderson Forecast. "That's a risky bet ... that
I'm not sure will pay off."</TE>
<TE>   After a fast start that saw U.S. gross domestic product advance
5.6% in the first quarter, the economy has shifted to a lower gear.</TE>
<TE>   That's to be expected, UCLA economists said, because much of that
early growth was the result of inventory restocking by U.S. firms.</TE>
<TE>   Spooked by the temporary drop in sales after the Sept. 11 attacks,
companies fearful of getting stuck with unsold merchandise liquidated
goods in their stockrooms at a record pace in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   But American consumers continued spending, enticed by incentives
such as auto makers' interest-free financing deals and low-interest
mortgage refinancing that allowed them to take cash out of their
homes.</TE>
<TE>   The result was that many companies ran low on inventory and began
replenishing in earnest. Speaking at a meeting of business economists
this week in downtown Los Angeles, Robert T. Parry, president and
chief executive of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco,
attributed two-thirds of first-quarter GDP growth to this massive
restocking effort, which has provided a welcome, albeit fleeting,
lift to the economy.</TE>
<TE>   "Although this turnaround in inventory investment will play out a
while longer, it will only boost growth temporarily," Parry said.
"We're now in the midst of a modest expansion ... [but] to keep the
expansion going, we'll need to see business pick up their spending on
equipment and software."</TE>
<TE>   The good news for recession-battered Northern California is that
signs are emerging of an increase in business investment. Global
sales of semiconductors improved considerably in March and April, and
U.S. industrial production figures released last week show solid
gains in output of computers and chips.</TE>
<TE>   However, that has yet to translate into job growth in the Bay
Area, which has lost more than 140,000 jobs since the employment peak
of January 2001, Lieser said.</TE>
<TE>   Even Southern California, which never fell into recession as
measured by employment, has seen its job creation weaken
substantially.</TE>
<TE>   On balance, the California economy has created a mere 2,500 net
new payroll jobs this year as employers under pressure to produce
profits and cautious about the strength of the recovery have held off
hiring. Lieser is projecting nonfarm payroll employment to increase
by 0.2% statewide in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   He expects that sluggish job growth, coupled with a growing labor
force, will result in average unemployment of 6.4% this year,
declining to an average of 6.3% next year and 6.1% in 2004. In May,
California's jobless rate was 6.3%, down from 6.5% in April.</TE>
<TE>   Weak employment growth probably will translate into anemic taxable
sales gains as well. The UCLA forecast projects taxable sales in
California to increase 0.4% in 2002, rebounding strongly to 5.2% in
2003 and 5.9% in 2004 as the jobs picture improves.</TE>
<TE>   As the overall economy lurches unevenly toward recovery, one
sector has bounded steadily upward--residential real estate.</TE>
<TE>   Median home prices, particularly in Southern California, have
inflated so rapidly of late that some are wondering if the bubble is
set to burst.</TE>
<TE>   The short answer is "probably" for Northern California and "not
yet" for the Southland, said Leamer, who nevertheless cautions that
Southern California cannot indefinitely sustain the furious price
appreciation seen over the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Leamer said that just as a stock's price ultimately must be linked
to a company's earnings, a home's price is related to the amount of
rent it could command in the open market.</TE>
<TE>   Examining home price and rental data for San Francisco and Los
Angeles, Leamer has calculated that the so-called price-earnings
ratio for San Francisco homes is at an all-time high, whereas L.A.'s
is below its 1989 peak.</TE>
<TE>   "We still have some room to run in Southern California," said
Leamer, noting that rents continue to climb steadily in the L.A.
region.</TE>
<TE>   As for Northern California, Leamer said he is mystified by
climbing home values, particularly because rents have fallen sharply
in response to the tech downturn. In the first quarter of 2001, rents
across the Bay Area fell about 17%, a decline that housing prices
ultimately will have to reflect, Leamer said.</TE>

<HD>Plenty of Takers for State's Short-Term Notes</HD>
<DH>Debt: Despite concerns over a looming budget shortfall,
California's $7.5-billion offering proves to be a success.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California attracted far more bids than needed for a record
$7.5-billion offering of short-term notes Tuesday, but still paid
higher yields than some other states, amid investor wariness over
budget woes.</LD>
<LD>   The notes, which mature between October and January, were priced
to yield between 1.7% and 1.8% annualized, depending on the maturity.
The interest is free of federal and California income taxes, so the
true return to investors is higher.</LD>
<LD>   Concern among investors about the state's $23.6-billion deficit
for fiscal 2003 forced California to pay more than it otherwise would
compared with other borrowers. For example, Idaho sold $350 million
of one-year notes Monday at a yield of 1.63%.</LD>
<TE>   Even so, the California offering was oversubscribed because
"people are looking for short-term alternatives to pick up a little
extra yield," said David Kotok, chief investment officer of
Cumberland Advisors Inc. in Vineland, N.J., which manages about $500
million.</TE>
<TE>   Many investors don't want to tie up money for more than a few
months "because there's a fear interest rates will rise" and hurt the
value of existing debt, he said.</TE>
<TE>   California received "a terrific show of interest" from investors,
as 12 securities firms submitted $22.4 billion worth of bids for the
notes, state Controller Kathleen Connell said. Morgan Stanley
submitted the winning bid for $4.1 billion of California's sale. The
remainder was distributed among other securities firms.</TE>
<TE>   The state, which typically sells so-called revenue-anticipation
notes to manage cash flow, isn't allowed to sell such securities
until a budget is approved for the new fiscal year beginning July 1.
State lawmakers are still debating ways to close the budget gap.</TE>
<TE>   In response, the state opted to sell a form of short-term notes
known as warrants to make sure it can pay its bills from July to
September. The warrants, under California law, are similar to
revenue-anticipation notes except that they can be repaid in a future
fiscal year. Revenue-anticipation notes must be repaid in the fiscal
year they are sold.</TE>

<HD>$20.3 Billion Cost Seen for Property Insurers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks will cost insurers $20.3 billion in
property claims, 22% higher than previously estimated, according to
Property Claims Services, a firm that tracks industry losses.</LD>
<LD>   The new estimate reflects 49,000 claims in New York including
30,000 for personal property insurance, 15,000 for business insurance
and 4,000 for automobiles, Property Claims Services said. The firm
also said it tracked 2,000 claims for a total of $6.5 million from
the attack on the Pentagon.</LD>
<LD>   In March, the company said insurers would face property losses of
$16.6 billion. Analysts and insurance executives have estimated total
losses may reach $70 billion. The PCS estimate doesn't include
liability, aviation, workers' compensation and life and health
insurance claims.</LD>

<HD>Sale of ImClone Shares Proper, Stewart Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Home design diva Martha Stewart insisted again Tuesday that inside
information played no role in her sale of shares in biotech firm
ImClone Systems Inc. in December. Stewart, head of Martha Stewart
Living Omnimedia Inc., said in a statement that she spoke earlier
this year with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S.
attorney's office about the trade, and has cooperated with a House
subcommittee that is probing ImClone.</LD>
<LD>   She described her Dec. 27 sale of nearly 4,000 ImClone shares as
"entirely proper and lawful" and said it was based on information
available to the public that day. The stock collapsed this year after
the government denied the firm's application for a new drug.</LD>

<LD>And so the head lifeguard of baseball's country club--to call it a
union is an embarrassment to real unions--met with Congress on
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   And so Congress asked Donald Fehr if his players would agree to be
tested for an illegal substance known as steroids, just as the NBA
and NFL players are tested.</LD>
<LD>   And so Fehr said no, giving a reason, "that can be summed up in a
single word: privacy."</LD>
<TE>   Privacy?</TE>
<TE>   Idiocy.</TE>
<TE>   Privacy?</TE>
<TE>   When I covered the Dodgers a decade ago, players joked that a
certain steroid-filled teammate had such awful back acne, they were
afraid to pat him on the shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Privacy?</TE>
<TE>   When I covered the Dodgers, there were players around the league
afraid to take off their towels in the clubhouse for fear that
teammates would see their shrunken lower extremities.</TE>
<TE>   Privacy?</TE>
<TE>   Steroid use has been public for years. But everyone, including
myself, has been shamefully afraid to discuss it because nobody would
confess and everyone would sue.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, allegations by longtime stars Jose Canseco and Ken
Caminiti lifted that curtain of fear.</TE>
<TE>   Now, while watching abnormally large men hit abnormal amounts of
home runs, it's difficult to discuss anything else.</TE>
<TE>   Would somebody please inject into Donald Fehr a syringe filled
with decency? Force him to swallow a supplement known as common
sense?</TE>
<TE>   The players' refusal to be tested for steroids makes them all
guilty, or at least accessories to what is absolutely a crime.</TE>
<TE>   If you don't believe me, listen to the clean ones.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to get there in the natural way," said Dodger Mark
Grudzielanek, the team's player representative who has clearly done
just that. "There has to be a level playing field."</TE>
<TE>   Eric Karros, who had recovered from back problems with
old-fashioned hard work, was more direct.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, test, absolutely," he said. "If for no other reason than,
it's illegal. End of discussion. End of story."</TE>
<TE>   It's heartening to hear that Dodger leaders feel that way. But
it's sad to think that, no, it's not the end of the story.</TE>
<TE>   Steroid testing is one of the issues being bartered in the
currently stalled labor talks. These same talks have the country-club
set so mad, a couple of them have threatened to skip the All-Star
game because it is at Milwaukee, home of Commissioner Bud Selig.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to go to Milwaukee and play in an All-Star game that
would benefit [Selig]," Boston pitcher John Burkett told the Boston
Globe last week.</TE>
<TE>   My heart breaks. And we so wanted to see this no-heart, no-class
dolt with a 16.50 earned-run average in two previous All-Star game
appearances infect Miller Stadium like a bad batch of brats.</TE>
<TE>   Burkett's comments were echoed by--surprise, surprise--Gary
Sheffield, who is understandably reluctant to return to the town
where he purposely made bad throws from third base.</TE>
<TE>   While this year's All-Star game has nothing to do with
steroids--except the average fan may need to be drugged to endure its
selfish pomposity--the players' reaction fits into the fans'
perception of them.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone already thinks this insulting group is filled with rich,
selfish, out-of-touch players.</TE>
<TE>   And then Tuesday, their leader tells Congress that they also
refuse to adhere to the law? Maybe this will be the summer that the
players finally realize they need a new leader.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, after enough good ones like Grudzielanek and Karros are
soiled by the reputation of all the bad ones, this will be the season
the players realize that their union is killing this game.</TE>
<TE>   Let's see, Donald Fehr gets paid ... how? Oh, yeah. By a
membership that evaluates him based on its average salary. Steroids
disappear, home runs decline, salaries fall, Fehr is lighter in the
wallet.</TE>
<TE>   So while true home-run hitters are forced to deny that they are
dirty, Fehr and his bobos stay in business.</TE>
<TE>   Privacy?</TE>
<TE>   If the majority of players continue to behave like they are above
the fans and above the law, they will have plenty of privacy.</TE>
<TE>   Summer is looking better and better without them.</TE>

<HD>Fehr Is Against Random Testing</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Players' union head tells Congress there should
be grounds for suspicion before steroid checks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHELLE MUNN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The head of the baseball players' union told Congress on Tuesday that
players should not be tested for steroids without reasonable grounds
for suspicion, and warned against new policies that would "smear"
athletes.</LD>
<LD>   "This discussion can be summed up in a single word: privacy,"
Donald Fehr, executive director and general counsel of the Major
League Baseball Players Assn., told a Senate Commerce subcommittee.</LD>
<LD>   The players' union has "always believed that one should not,
absent compelling safety considerations, invade the privacy of
someone without a substantial reason," he added.</LD>
<TE>   Jerry Colangelo, managing general partner of the Arizona
Diamondbacks, argued it is time for baseball to adopt screening
policies similar to those in place in other professional sports
leagues.</TE>
<TE>   "If a person makes mistakes over and over again, we have to deal
with it. Being a professional athlete is a privilege, not an
entitlement," Colangelo said.</TE>
<TE>   The testimony marked the first time Congress has held hearings on
sports drug testing since the subject began drawing intensified
public attention.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the Olympics, NBA and NFL, baseball does not have a testing
program aimed at detecting steroids. But attention of lawmakers has
been captured by allegations from retired players Ken Caminiti and
Jose Canseco that a high percentage of players have used
performance-enhancing substances. The issue is sure to be a point of
friction in the collective bargaining talks that are scheduled to
resume today between the owners and players in Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   "Bulging muscles clearly attest to the physical strength of our
athletes, but anecdotes of drug use suggest that many may not have
the moral fiber to match," said Sen. Byron Dorgan, (D-N.D.), who
called the hearing as subcommittee chairman.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL tests any player whose name is randomly selected by a
computer. The NBA may test first-year players randomly three times
each year, and veterans once each year. All test for steroids and
other drugs. In baseball, only minor leaguers who are not included on
their major-league team's 40-man roster are subject to random
testing.</TE>
<TE>   "Three strikes, and you're out in the NBA," said Colangelo, who is
also president and chief executive of basketball's Phoenix Suns.
"Random mandatory testing is not to catch anyone, but to act as a
deterrent."</TE>
<TE>   Baseball owners in February presented an 11-page plan on testing
to the union, calling for players to submit to three mandatory tests
each year for steroids and androstenedione, a substance readily
available at health food stores that acts like a steroid by building
muscle tissue.</TE>
<TE>   A representative for the players association said last week that
the players would demand at least two concessions to the owners'
testing plan: no suspension for a first positive test; and assurance
that test results would be kept confidential.</TE>
<TE>   The issue was brought to public attention after Canseco claimed
last month that 85% of players use anabolic steroids. Caminiti said
that he won the 1996 National League most valuable player award while
on them, and put the usage figure at about 50%.</TE>
<TE>   Steroids, which are banned in the U.S. except by prescription, are
used by some athletes to build muscle and help in the recovery from
strenuous workouts. Adverse effects of use include facial hair and
deepened voices for women, impotence and premature balding for men,
and increased cancer rates, stunted growth, and damaged organ systems
for all. Steroids may also cause muscles to grow so fast that
ligaments and tendons--the musculature support system--are prone to
strains and tears.</TE>
<TE>   Some medical experts believe baseball's spike in injuries may be a
reflection of steroid use. Last year, players made 467 trips to the
disabled list, a 16% increase from 1998. And injured players are on
the bench longer; the average stay has increased from 55 days to 58
days, and the total number of days league-wide from 22,100 to 27,430,
an increase of almost 20% over the same period.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors contacted by the commissioner's office said the pattern of
injuries was consistent with a significant increase in muscle mass,
Robert Manfred, baseball's executive vice president in charge of
labor relations and human resources, told the Congressional panel.</TE>
<TE>   "No one cares more about the game, and the health of the players,
than the players themselves," Fehr said. But he warned that the
possibility of over-the-counter supplements like androstenedione
could trigger false positive tests in players, and hamper any testing
plans.</TE>
<TE>   The union and owners called on Congress to revisit the issue of
regulating over-the-counter supplements.</TE>
<TE>   Fehr also warned that public health issues with steroids would not
be solved by baseball instituting a steroid testing policy.</TE>
<TE>   "If children are using a lot of these substances, it is in large
part because 11-year-olds can walk into the store and buy them," Fehr
said. "It's a much bigger question than what we do in baseball."</TE>

<HD>Appier's Worries, Losses Mount</HD>
<DH>Angels: Veteran surrenders nine hits and lasts two-plus
innings in 7-2 loss to the Cardinals, his fifth straight defeat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Angel starter Kevin Appier has overcome too much in 13 major league
seasons to panic because of a rough stretch.</LD>
<LD>   Manager Mike Scioscia sticks with veterans during tough times
because he doesn't scare easily, either.</LD>
<LD>   Then again, there comes a point when experience helps only so
much. Appier struggled again Tuesday night in the St. Louis
Cardinals' 7-2 interleague victory at Busch Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   Appier (5-6) lasted only two-plus innings in his fourth straight
ineffective outing, dropping his fifth in a row as the Angels (39-28)
lost their third in a row and fell two games behind the first-place
Seattle Mariners in the American League West.</TE>
<TE>   Drawing on past success has helped the 152-game winner during
previous hard times, but even that's wearing thin now.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if that's helping so much anymore," said Appier,
whose earned-run average ballooned from 3.87 to 4.48. "It's still
very tough. Definitely."</TE>
<TE>   Pitching coach Bud Black remains optimistic, saying Appier does
not need a major overhaul to return to form.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going through a rough stretch and he has to work his way
through it," Black said. "There is not a magic solution. You trust
your ability and what made you a winning pitcher, and you keep going
out there."</TE>
<TE>   A crowd of 39,386 barely had time to settle in before Appier was
on the ropes again, getting pounded for nine hits--including two home
runs--in his shortest stint in 14 starts with the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Appier faced three batters in the third, getting chased on Edgar
Renteria's two-run homer that gave the Cardinals a 6-0 lead. That
marked another early exit for a starter who has made many recently.</TE>
<TE>   "We're human," Scioscia said. "[Players are] obviously going to
have some highs and lows, ups and downs. But our patience is strong,
especially with Ape, because we know what he brings."</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal center fielder Jim Edmonds seized an opportunity against
Appier, leading off the third inning with an opposite-field home run
in his first game against his former team since having been traded in
March, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonds provided another flashback for the Angels while chasing
down Bengie Molina's deep drive to left-center in the seventh,
receiving a standing ovation after making one of those running,
sliding, highlight-reel catches that marked his six-plus seasons at
Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt like it was an intrasquad game," Edmonds said. "They were
all on the other side and I was by myself."</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis starter Darryl Kile (5-4) cruised through 7 2/3 strong
innings in winning for the third time in four starts, helping the
Cardinals (39-29) take sole possession of first in the National
League Central with their fourth win in a row.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are in their first skid since losing four consecutive
games from April 20-23, and Appier's problems top their list of
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "He's in a little funk right now," Scioscia said. "Ape was behind
in the count a lot, and it's tough to pitch that way. He dug too much
of a hole."</TE>
<TE>   Appier began the season 5-1 with a 2.96 ERA in his first nine
starts. He has an 8.31 ERA during the five-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had a number of bad stretches," Appier said. "This is a
lengthy one, but I've pulled out of a whole bunch of them.</TE>
<TE>   "After games like this, sometimes you think throwing eight shutout
innings seems so far off. But I still know I can get back to that."</TE>
<TE>   How?</TE>
<TE>   "I have to continue searching with my coaches and stuff like
that," he said. "It's a balancing act, because you don't want to
listen to too much.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really easy to get information that doesn't apply; that's
not going to fix things. But these guys are good. They should be able
to point to something that we can work on that, hopefully, can fix
it."</TE>

<HD>St. Louis Renews Edmonds' Spirit</HD>

<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Time and distance have tempered Jim Edmonds' mood, so much so that
the St. Louis Cardinal All-Star center fielder says he's "happy" for
the Angels.</LD>
<LD>   Edmonds is impressed with his former club's strong performance in
the American League West, and facing the Angels for the first time
since having been traded in March, 2000, isn't as difficult as some
might think.</LD>
<LD>   "They're playing great," said Edmonds, who hit his 13th home run
Tuesday night in the Cardinals' 7-2 interleague victory at Busch
Stadium. "To get that close to Seattle ... they're really putting
some pressure on them. They've got a chance."</LD>
<TE>   Of course, it's easier to take the high road when you're as
content as Edmonds.</TE>
<TE>   He has had two-plus charmed seasons in baseball-loving St. Louis,
reveling in a town that embraces the Cardinals. There's no question
that the Cardinals got the better of the deal that brought Edmonds to
St. Louis for pitcher Kent Bottenfield and second baseman Adam
Kennedy, and Edmonds has played in the last two postseasons after
watching the playoffs on TV in six-plus seasons with the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Talk about peace of mind.</TE>
<TE>   "People say the mind is a powerful thing," said Edmonds, who
returned to the lineup Sunday after a stint on the disabled list
because of a sprained right wrist. "I think coming to the stadium
every day, and being on a good club, and having people in your corner
I think that has made all the difference in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Edmonds no longer reflects on his strained past with the
organization that drafted and developed him, saying he's a different
person now.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm three years older and little bit more mature," he said. "I've
been to the postseason and I know what every game means now. I know
what it's like to be in a winning situation. It makes you grow up and
it makes you become a better player under pressure. That's something
that I've always been; I just think I'm a little bit better than I
was.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to remember that those people [Angel management] had
been watching me since I was 17 years old. Some of those old thoughts
[about him] lingered around in their heads for so long, it was hard
for them to get past that. Here, they don't have that. What you see
is what you get. Being so young early probably tainted some of their
views of the way I played the game."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels plan to recall right-hander John Lackey from triple-A
Salt Lake City to start during Monday's doubleheader against the
Texas Rangers at The Ballpark in Arlington.</TE>
<TE>   Lackey, 23, is 8-2 with a 2.70 earned-run average in 15 starts for
the Stingers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reserve outfielder Julio Ramirez suffered a strained left calf
chasing a fly ball in center field during batting practice, a team
spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez, who slipped on the warning track, was taken off the field
in a cart and examined by Cardinal physician Stan London. He will be
put on the 15-day disabled list, and the Angels will recall reliever
Brendan Donnelly from Salt Lake City.... First baseman Shawn Wooten
(strained muscle on right side) took batting practice and might begin
a rehabilitation assignment next week.... The club has extended Salt
Lake City's contract through 2004.</TE>

<LD>New York Met left-hander Shawn Estes probably will be fined for
throwing a pitch behind New York Yankee ace Roger Clemens, major
league disciplinarian Bob Watson said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Watson said Estes' pitch Saturday violated rule 8.02 (d), which
states that the pitcher shall not intentionally throw at the batter.
He said he has made a decision about the fine but will not announce
the amount.</LD>
<LD>   "We need to inform some people of what we're going to do. It's
going to take awhile," Watson said. "I've talked to all the parties
involved."</LD>
<TE>   Watson's office does not release information about fines, only
suspensions.</TE>

<LD>John Wooden says Red Auerbach was misguided when the former Boston
Celtic coach suggested recently that Phil Jackson wins only because
he has superior talent.</LD>
<LD>   "Of course he had talent," Wooden told Bloomberg News. "Anyone who
wins has talent, but not every coach wins with it.</LD>
<LD>   "What did Auerbach do before he had [Bill] Russell?"</LD>
<TE>   Wooden, 91, hasn't spoken to Auerbach about his criticism of
Jackson, but he'd tell him to stop bashing the Laker coach and
acknowledge his accomplishments.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd tell Red that Phil's done a great job, just as you did," said
Wooden, who guided UCLA to 10 NCAA titles, one more than Auerbach and
Jackson each won as coaches in the NBA. "It's not taking anything
away from you at all. You just have to give the other fellow credit."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: What Hall of Fame pitcher spent the most time in the
major leagues without playing in a World Series?</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere man: With the NBA draft approaching, Celtic General
Manager Chris Wallace says he doesn't see any potential challengers
to Shaquille O'Neal:</TE>
<TE>   "Unless I'm missing someone, that person is not in the Big East.
He's not in the ACC or Big Ten. He doesn't play in Europe. Maybe he's
in Tibet somewhere, but I haven't seen him."</TE>
<TE>   Fast lane: The Laker victory parade "went through downtown L.A.
about 4 mph," says Jay Leno. "This is the only city in the world
where the parades actually move faster than the normal traffic."</TE>
<TE>   Helping hand: Growing up, Michael Vick often wore a replica of
Steve Young's No. 8 jersey because he identified with a left-handed
quarterback who was a good runner. Now Vick will get the chance to
work out with his boyhood hero.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta Falcon Coach Dan Reeves says Young, a two-time NFL most
valuable player with the San Francisco 49ers, will visit the team's
mini-camp in July to give pointers to Vick, the No. 1 overall pick in
the 2001 NFL draft.</TE>
<TE>   "He knew we wanted him, and it was just a matter of him finding
the time to come here," Reeves said.</TE>
<TE>   Double fault: Tatum O'Neal gives a thumbs-down review to former
husband John McEnroe's new memoir, "You've Got to Be Kidding."</TE>
<TE>   "The book is all [garbage]," O'Neal told Britain's Daily Mail.
"It's not true. He's a sociopath."</TE>
<TE>   Teen scene: In a recent online poll conducted by teen marketer
Alloy, skateboarder Tony Hawk was voted "coolest big-time athlete,"
ahead of Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan and New York Yankee shortstop
Derek Jeter.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Phil Niekro, who flung the knuckleball for 24
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Like a lot of people, Dave Kidd of Britain's Sun
tabloid is stunned about who's gone and who's still competing in the
World Cup:</TE>
<TE>   "[France's] Zinedine Zidane is mowing the lawn, [Portugal's] Luis
Figo is creosoting his fence and [Argentina's] Gabriel Batistuta is
putting up shelves for the missus.</TE>
<TE>   "Meanwhile, [U.S. players] are licking their lips in anticipation
of a World Cup quarterfinal. What a crazy, upside-down tournament
this is. And there is nothing crazier than the sight of the Yanks in
the last eight."</TE>

<HD>Broadcaster Jack Buck Dies at 77</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Jack Buck, who in nearly five decades as a broadcaster became a St.
Louis institution and one of the most recognizable voices in sports,
died late Tuesday night, his son Joe Buck said.</LD>
<LD>   The Hall of Famer underwent lung cancer surgery Dec. 5, then went
back in Barnes-Jewish Hospital Jan. 3 to have an intestinal blockage
removed. He never left the hospital. He was 77.</LD>
<LD>   "We miss him already," Joe Buck said on KMOX radio, where his
father worked for many years. "But I've been missing him for months."</LD>
<TE>   Jack Buck started calling Cardinal games on radio in 1954, teaming
first with Harry Caray and for the last three decades with former
Cardinal third baseman Mike Shannon.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, Buck called everything from Super Bowls to the World
Series to pro bowling for CBS, ABC and NBC.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't change a thing about my life," Buck wrote in a 1997
autobiography. "My childhood dreams came true."</TE>
<TE>   Buck's gravelly voice--crafted in part, he said, by too many years
smoking cigarettes--described to a national radio audience the
indescribable end to Game 1 of the 1988 World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe what I just saw!" he yelled after Dodger
outfielder Kirk Gibson, barely able to walk, hit a two-run,
game-winning homer off Oakland's Dennis Eckersley.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A complete obituary will run in Thursday's editions.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Unhittable!"</LD>
<LD>   Author: Gabriel Schechter</LD>
<TE>   Publisher: Charles April Publications, Los Gatos, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Price: $19.95</TE>
<TE>   "Unhittable! Baseball's Greatest Pitching Seasons" tells the story
behind the story of 25 of baseball's most incredible pitching years.</TE>
<TE>   What makes this book unique is that author Gabriel Schechter, in
his own words, tells "not so much what these pitchers did as how they
did it and how the achievements were regarded at the time."</TE>
<TE>   Schechter, a New York native and longtime teacher, admits that
selecting his own Top 25 was a subjective process. "My dictionary,"
he says in the book's introduction, "contains thirteen definitions of
the word great."</TE>
<TE>   Schechter pays homage not only to the big-statistic
seasons--30-game winners, most strikeouts, etc.--but also to
lesser-known feats, like pitchers who fought through arm pain and
inexperience to lead their team to pennants.</TE>
<TE>   Featured are many all-time greats, such as Cy Young, Walter
Johnson and Sandy Koufax. But Schechter also includes such active
pitchers as Pedro Martinez, Greg Maddux and Randy Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   A lifelong fan of pitching, Schechter appears to leave nothing out
of this 392-page, graphic-filled book. Charts include everything from
pitchers' game-by-game box scores to the players backing them up in
the field.</TE>
<TE>   There's even entertaining biographical information on each
pitcher, such as Cy Young's real name: Denton True Young.</TE>
<TE>   Schechter closes the book with "the best of the rest" and "the
best of the pen."</TE>
<TE>   He is now working on a book of baseball's greatest hitting
seasons.</TE>

scalping a World Cup ticket is being held under conditions that are
normal in Japan and "comply with international standards," British
Embassy spokeswoman Sue Kinoshita said.</LD>
<LD>   John Jones, a 43-year-old jeweler from London, has been kept in
solitary confinement since being arrested June 1 outside the stadium
at Niigata. He was accused of selling a friend's unwanted game ticket
for nearly twice its value.</LD>

he must be charged or set free, Kinoshita said.</LD>

<HD>Dodger Loss Is Complete</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Blue Jays' Halladay goes the distance in 2-1
victory. Ashby effort is wasted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the home of Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale and Fernando Valenzuela,
Roy Halladay pitched the way the old-timers did--and Carlos Tosca
managed the way the old-timers did.</LD>
<LD>   The Toronto Blue Jays led the Dodgers by one run Tuesday, with one
inning to go. But, in this era of the closer, the Blue Jays' closer
never even warmed up. Halladay breezed through the ninth inning,
completing a four-hitter and a 2-1 victory that dropped the Dodgers
two games behind the Arizona Diamondbacks in the National League
West.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't remember a better game being pitched against us," Dodger
center fielder Dave Roberts said. "He had his cut fastball working.
His sinker was incredible. He threw his curves for strikes whenever
he wanted. When he throws like that, there's nothing you can do."</LD>
<TE>   Halladay, who threw a two-hitter at the Colorado Rockies 12 days
ago, dispatched the Dodgers on 99 pitches. He struck out seven and
walked two, and the only run he gave up was unearned. His fastball
was 93 mph in the first inning and in the ninth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Conventional wisdom tells the manager to bring in his closer to
protect a one-run lead in the ninth. The Blue Jays have a pretty good
closer in Kelvim Escobar, but Halladay is by far their best pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no thoughts of lifting him," Tosca said. "Nobody was
getting any comfortable swings against him. I didn't see any
difference in his stuff. He had a low pitch count."</TE>
<TE>   Halladay, 8-3 and likely to be the Blue Jays' representative in
the All-Star game, said he threw about 80% fastballs, and almost all
fastballs early in the game.</TE>
<TE>   "The pitch count is down, you go aggressively after the hitters,"
Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said, "and guess what? You're still standing
out there in the ninth inning."</TE>
<TE>   In his first game against his old team, Shawn Green singled home
the Dodgers' lone run, an unearned run in the eighth inning. But
Halladay breezed through the ninth--Eric Karros lined out, Mark
Grudzielanek struck out and Adrian Beltre popped up.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 27 outs, Halladay got 13 on ground balls.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger starter Andy Ashby (6-6) was splendid in defeat. He has
pitched into the eighth inning in each of his four starts this month,
and he did so again Tuesday. He gave up two runs over eight innings,
walking two and striking out five and lowering his earned-run average
to 2.82.</TE>
<TE>   In seven starts at Dodger Stadium, his ERA is 1.69, but his record
is 3-3.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Jays featured a few stars in the middle of their lineup,
but they wouldn't have scored without the contributions of the
anonymous men at the top and bottom of the batting order.</TE>
<TE>   With one out in the second inning, Ashby walked Jose Cruz Jr.
After Cruz stole second base, Joe Lawrence singled him to third, and
Ken Huckaby singled him home, and Toronto led, 1-0.</TE>
<TE>   Ashby retired the next 10 hitters, with only one managing to hit
the ball out of the infield. But the Dodgers could do little against
Halladay, and the Blue Jays finally nicked Ashby for another run in
the sixth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Felipe Lopez, the shortstop the Blue Jays opted to keep when they
traded Cesar Izturis to the Dodgers, singled to start the sixth. Eric
Hinske, the talented rookie third baseman obtained from Oakland for
closer Billy Koch, walked.</TE>
<TE>   Although Shannon Stewart grounded into a double play, Carlos
Delgado followed with a double, scoring Lopez and giving Toronto a
2-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The game marked the return of Raul Mondesi to Dodger Stadium,
although he did nothing special to commemorate the occasion. He went
hitless in four at-bats, failing to get the ball out of the infield.</TE>

<HD>Mondesi Recalls the Good Times</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The right-field pavilion was empty Tuesday. There was no one there to
cheer for, or to boo, the man who played right field at Dodger
Stadium for six seasons and returned there Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   For the first time since the Dodgers traded him to the Toronto
Blue Jays three years ago, Raul Mondesi played at Dodger Stadium. The
small announced crowd of 24,991 greeted him with a mixture of "boo"
and "Ra-oool," but fans once alienated by Mondesi had long since
gotten over him, in no small part because the Dodgers were able to
get Shawn Green for him.</LD>
<LD>   Four hours before game time, Mondesi said he was so excited he
wanted to start playing right away. He recalled the good times, the
fans who would see him in the streets of Los Angeles, or in a
restaurant, and reach out to hug him.</LD>
<TE>   "When I used to play here, they loved me," he said. "I think I
still have some fans here. I know some fans will boo me and say not
good things about me, but it doesn't bother me."</TE>
<TE>   Mondesi, branded a malcontent in his final season here after an
expletive-filled tirade against then-manager Davey Johnson, said he
needed to be traded from the Dodgers but insists he is happy in
Toronto. He said he would like the Blue Jays to trade for help,
including pitching, but the team is rebuilding and would prefer to
trade Mondesi if it could find a taker for a contract that guarantees
him $13 million next season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And what happened Tuesday in the home of Dodger Manager Jim Tracy?</TE>
<TE>   "Our beagle hound tore up a rally monkey," Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   No, really. Tracy's sons had brought home one of the Angel mascots
a while back, and the family dog chewed it up Tuesday, for no
apparent reason. Asked whether the dog was somehow retaliating for
the Angels hitting Green with a pitch Sunday, an incident that caused
benches to clear, Tracy laughed--but he wouldn't bite.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers will open a theme restaurant Thursday at Universal
CityWalk, featuring such stadium fare as Dodger dogs, burgers, fries
and Cracker Jack. The Dodgers don't expect to make much money off the
snack shack, but they plan to sell merchandise there and hope to
generate ticket sales among locals and tourists. Kris Rone, the
Dodgers' marketing chief, assures fans that the Dodger dogs there
will be grilled, preventing the popular uprising that occurred when a
team concessionaire once decided to steam the dogs.</TE>
<TE>   Said Rone: "They've had very strict discussions on how a Dodger
dog should be served."</TE>

<HD>Germany Has Its Own 'Rudi'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>Germany is to World Cups what the omnipresent vending machine is to
Asian cuisine. Efficient, mechanical and sturdy, they both yield a
product that suffices yet seldom entices.</LD>
<LD>   Whereas some machines specialize in soup or sandwiches or piping
hot fried rice, Germany serves up quarterfinal berths. Sometimes it
looks a little odd. Sometimes it makes weird noises. But
dependability is something that can't be overvalued when you're in a
strange country, as fans of France, Argentina and Italy surely will
attest.</LD>
<LD>   But when Germany qualified the other day for its 12th quarterfinal
appearance in the last 13 World Cups, millions of customers
previously served were demanding a refund. Germany's 1-0 victory over
Paraguay--scoreless until Oliver Neuville's merciful 88th-minute
goal--was the undisputed clunker in a lively second round of upsets
and overtime thrillers. One newspaper in England went so far as to
call it one of the worst World Cup games ever played.</LD>
<TE>   German Coach Rudi Voeller, who has played in some great ones,
bristled when informed of the dubious honor.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is some criticism coming from England, then we must be
doing something right," Voeller deadpanned. "The fact that we have
qualified must upset some people."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, considering the state of German soccer two years ago,
qualifying for the quarterfinals qualifies as an absolute shock.
German soccer reached its lowest ebb at the 2000 European
championships, when the team failed to reach the second round of a
major tournament for the first time since 1938.</TE>
<TE>   The national team was so devoid of young talent then, Coach Erich
Ribbeck opted to recall a relic, 39-year-old Lothar Matthaus, to head
the German defense, to rather predictable results.</TE>
<TE>   The job of coaching the national team was so unappealing that when
the German federation fired Ribbeck after the tournament, none of the
country's top coaches was willing to replace him.</TE>
<TE>   Out of desperation, the federation agreed to a layaway deal with
Bayer Leverkusen's Christophe Daum, who was contracted to stay with
his club until the end of the 2000-2001 season. In the interim,
Germany had a World Cup qualification campaign to wage, so the
federation turned to former World Cup scoring hero Voeller and named
him interim manager.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the best thing they could do," said Thomas Haeberlein, a
soccer reporter for the German sports wire service SID. "Voeller gave
them instant credibility. From that point on, players didn't have an
alibi again. He was always respected as a player, he had 90 caps and
45 goals for Germany, second only to Gerd Muller. He was always
credible, and still is.</TE>
<TE>   "From then on, the players knew that if they failed, they would
have only themselves to blame. And the public knew as well."</TE>
<TE>   One crisis was averted, but a bigger one was knocking on the door.
In the fall of 2000, Daum, responding to media rumors that he was a
cocaine addict, submitted to a drug test. He failed, then admitted
during a news conference that he used the drug on a casual basis.</TE>
<TE>   Voeller was interim coach no more. After a few encouraging
qualification-game results, including a 1-0 victory over England in
the final game played at Wembley Stadium, Voeller was given a
contract through the 2002 World Cup, and an anxious nation gave him
an edict: Rudi can't fail.</TE>
<TE>   He came precariously close. Voeller's team fell out of first place
in its qualification group after a humiliating 5-1 home defeat to
England in September 2001. Needing a victory at home against Finland
to clinch qualification, Germany couldn't manage more than a 0-0 tie
and was forced into a two-game playoff with Ukraine.</TE>
<TE>   "Too stupid for the World Cup," read the headline in the German
newspaper Bild the day after the Finland match. Another unimpressive
tie followed in the first leg with Ukraine, requiring Germany to win
the rematch or else.</TE>
<TE>   Germany had never previously failed to qualify for a World Cup, so
the subsequent 4-1 triumph was the cause for wild celebrations in the
street. "It was like Easter and Christmas all falling on the same
day," Haeberlein said.</TE>
<TE>   Voeller had a team in the World Cup. What he next needed was a
team that wouldn't embarrass itself in the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   The prospects, as late as a month ago, weren't encouraging. Franz
Beckenbauer, the legendary German defender and coach, dismissed the
national team as "average" and "not ready yet." German soccer,
Beckenbauer acknowledged, "is a little depressed at the moment."</TE>
<TE>   The team eventually cobbled together by Voeller is built around an
excellent goalkeeper, Oliver Kahn; six other so-called "Euro
losers"--members of the failed Euro 2000 squad; and one undersized,
23-year-old forward named Miroslav Klose.</TE>
<TE>   Klose first caught Voeller's attention in early 2001, after
working his way through the youth ranks to a starting position with
the German First Division club Kaiserslautern, where Klose was an
immediate scoring success. Some considered him too slight for the
rigors of international competition, but Voeller, also economy-sized,
gambled on Klose, saying the striker "reminds me of me."</TE>
<TE>   Voeller is famous for drawing the foul in the 1990 World Cup final
against Argentina that set up Germany for the winning penalty kick.
It was a classic piece of cunning--Voeller running alongside defender
Roberto Sensini until Sensini extended his leg inside the box.
Voeller saw the leg and fell over it. Penalty, goal, championship to
Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Germans have a word, schlitzohr, that describes someone who will
tread the fine line between fair play and foul in order to get the
best result for himself. On the soccer field, this extends to anyone
who will do anything within the rules, and occasionally outside them,
for the good of the team, for the purposes of scoring the vital goal.
Voeller once fit that description as a player. Now, so does Klose,
who has finagled his way to five goals in this World Cup, tying him
for the lead with Brazil's Ronaldo.</TE>
<TE>   Backed by Kahn and a typically resilient defense, Klose has
provided enough offense to keep Germany unbeaten through four World
Cup matches, setting up a Friday quarterfinal against the United
States that has Germany once again thinking semifinal, and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Beckenbauer has changed his mind on the team, saying last weekend
that he now expects Germany to reach the final. "I fly home for a
couple days, but will be back soon to watch the semifinals,"
Beckenbauer told Bild. "Rudi should wait for me here or else I will
get angry ... I believe Brazil and Germany will meet in the final."</TE>
<TE>   Maradona, who tangled with Voeller in the 1986 and 1990 World Cup
finals, wrote in a guest column for the Swiss newspaper Blick that
"Germany look invincible. Even though they display rather predictable
performances, Germany appear to be too strong for their rivals."</TE>
<TE>   Voeller has the vending machine operational again. As they tell
you here, it always helps knowing which buttons to push.</TE>

<LD>Although it took longer than it was supposed to, the $75,000-added
Robert K. Kerlan Memorial Handicap will be run for the sixth time
this afternoon at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<LD>   The 5 1/2-furlong turf race, renamed in 1997 to honor the late
orthopedic surgeon, was postponed twice because of lack of entries
and it didn't exactly draw a large field today.</LD>
<LD>   Six horses were entered and there will be only five betting
interests because Tavasco and Rocky Bar, owned by Triple AAA Ranch,
will race coupled.</LD>
<TE>   Trainer Bobby Frankel, who has amassed 19 stakes victories this
year, is scheduled to send out likely favorite Blu Air Force and
longshot Igman.</TE>
<TE>   Blu Air Force, a 5-year-old Irish-bred owned by the Wildenstein
Stable, beat Swept Overboard in an allowance race on this course at
this distance more than a year ago in his U.S. debut. The Kerlan will
be his first start since he was third to Swept Overboard and Speak In
Passing in the Hollywood Turf Express on Nov. 23.</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Kory Owens has the entry of Tavasco and Rocky Bar while
the field is completed by Astonished and Gallant.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Adminniestrator, First Titanium and Irish Warrior
head a small, but quality, field in Hollywood Park's second, a
$58,000 allowance at 1 1/16 miles on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: The Hollywood Park trainer's race. Leaders Frankel and
Vladimir Cerin have 13 victories apiece; eight other trainers are
within five wins of the top.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Jose Silva. The trainer has lost with his first 20
starters at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A trifecta in the fifth, keying Rehabilitated
on top with Mandan, Farmas Dream, Para Usted and Jillings in the two
hole and all in the third spot.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/107. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $31.80/$628.20. Total money bet: $690.</TE>

<HD>Griffey Is the Star, but Mariners Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Junior got the hits and made the incredible catch, yet his former
team got along just fine without him.</LD>
<LD>   Ken Griffey Jr. singled for his 2,000th hit and smacked into the
padded outfield wall to steal a hit Tuesday night but could only slow
the Seattle Mariners as they rolled to an 8-1 victory over the Reds
at Cincinnati.</LD>
<LD>   Joel Pineiro pitched 6 1/3 innings and drove in two runs with a
single--his first major league hit--but the focus was on Griffey.</LD>
<TE>   He had an infield single in his first at-bat for his 2,000th hit.</TE>
<TE>   In the sixth, Griffey slammed into the wall in center field to
catch Ben Davis' sacrifice fly, holding on as he did a backward flip,
then popping to his feet as his hat flew off.</TE>
<TE>   For that one moment, it seemed like old times.</TE>
<TE>   "Great play," said Mariner Manager Lou Piniella, who had Griffey
for seven years in Seattle. "I thought the ball was going to go off
the wall. I've seen Junior make a lot of great plays. It's good to
see him back on the field. I hope he stays healthy."</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 6, Baltimore 3--Brian Anderson (2-6) won for the first
time in his last 18 regular-season starts, and Erubiel Durazo homered
and drove in three runs for the Diamondbacks at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 8, San Francisco 3--Greg Vaughn and Aubrey Huff each
homered at San Francisco and the Devil Rays won for the fourth time
in six games.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Kennedy (5-5) gave up three runs and eight hits in seven
innings for Tampa Bay.</TE>
<TE>   New York Yankees 10, Colorado 5--Derek Jeter and Robin Ventura
each homered and drove in three runs apiece at Colorado, where the
Yankees had 17 hits and homered three times to help Mike Mussina
(10-3) overcome a rough start.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 6, New York Mets 1--Johan Santana (2-1) gave up three
hits in six innings, and Torii Hunter homered to lift the Twins at
New York.</TE>
<TE>   Dustan Mohr and A.J. Pierzynski also homered for the Twins, who
won their third in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 5, Kansas City 4--Wil Cordero's pinch-hit single with two
out in the seventh inning scored Orlando Cabrera, who had tied the
score with a two-run double, and capped a decisive three-run rally
for the Expos at Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 6, Atlanta 0--Jeff Weaver (5-8) pitched a five-hitter at
Atlanta and improved his interleague record to 8-1. He retired 17 of
the last 18 hitters, striking out seven.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 4, Pittsburgh 2--Mark Mulder won his fifth consecutive
start to give the visiting Athletics their 10th victory in 11 games
in the first meeting between the 115-year-old Pirates and the
101-year-old Athletics.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago Cubs 4, Texas 3--Alex Gonzalez led off the bottom of the
ninth inning with a homer against John Rocker in the first major
league game featuring four players with 400 home runs.</TE>
<TE>   Texas' Rafael Palmeiro hit a homer for No. 460. Other
400-homer-club members in the game were Chicago's Sammy Sosa (475)
and Fred McGriff (459), and the Rangers' Juan Gonzalez (401).</TE>
<TE>   Chicago White Sox 6, Philadelphia 3--Kenny Lofton's two-run triple
in the 12th inning scored Carlos Lee and Jose Valentin at
Philadelphia. Lofton then scored on an error.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 4, San Diego 2--Shea Hillenbrand hit a three-run homer in
the eighth inning against Brian Lawrence (7-4) at San Diego. Trot
Nixon and Nomar Garciaparra had singled to open the inning.</TE>

<HD>Italy Has a Host of Woes</HD>
<DH>Round of 16: South Korea knocks out one of favorites, 2-1,
on 'golden goal' after tying score in the 88th minute.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>The World Cup of surprises produced another sensational upset Tuesday
night, and this one sent an entire nation into a frenzy of
celebration.</LD>
<LD>   South Korea, "The Land of Morning Calm," was anything but in the
early hours today as millions of chanting, drum-beating,
horn-honking, flag-waving, firework-exploding, "Be the Reds"
T-shirt-wearing fans took to the streets in cities all across the
country.</LD>
<LD>   The reason?</LD>
<TE>   A simple soccer score: South Korea 2, Italy 1.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the most dramatic games of Asia's first World Cup and
one of the most startling upsets in international soccer history, the
co-host ousted the three-time world champion under the most
improbable of circumstances to advance to the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea, inspired by Dutch Coach Guus Hiddink and featuring a
team of players who absolutely refused to give up, was less than two
minutes away from elimination when it turned the game upside down.</TE>
<TE>   A dreadful defensive blunder by Christian Panucci in the 88th
minute was the direct cause of the Italians' downfall. The "Azzurri"
might never be the same.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Seol Ki-Hyeon, who scored the tying goal, and
Ahn Jung-Hwan, who headed home the game-winning "golden goal" 27
minutes into sudden-death overtime, have become instant idols.</TE>
<TE>   The victory, achieved in front of the massed red ranks of 38,588
fans at sold-out Daejeon World Cup Stadium, and an estimated 90,000
more watching on a giant screen in a park outside the stadium, ranks
as the single-greatest sporting achievement in the nation's history.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of what happens from here on out, this World Cup is
guaranteed to be remembered as a huge success for South Korea and its
people.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a tremendous, tremendous achievement for Korean football,"
said Hiddink, who coached the Netherlands to the semifinals of the
1998 World Cup before being lured to South Korea to weave some magic
here. "We have beaten one of the superpowers of football."</TE>
<TE>   Hiddink already was a national hero even before this game.
"Hiddink for President" banners decorated the stands. The government
has offered to make him South Korea's first honorary citizen, and the
South Korean soccer federation has given him $1 million simply for
getting its team into the second round.</TE>
<TE>   What his latest achievement will bring him is anyone's guess. What
it did bring him immediately was a telephone call from President Kim
Dae-Jung, who reportedly told Hiddink that "the country and I are
very proud of you."</TE>
<TE>   What the result also brought him was a quarterfinal date with what
will surely be a very nervous Spain in Gwangju on Saturday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Things did not always go South Korea's way Tuesday night, however.
There was, for instance, the missed penalty kick by eventual hero Ahn
in the fourth minute, when his shot was saved by goalkeeper Gianluigi
Buffon, who made several fine stops during regulation and overtime to
thwart the Koreans.</TE>
<TE>   Italy seemed unperturbed by the atmosphere in the stadium, which
South Korea's "Red Devils" fans had draped with banners that read:
"Welcome to Azzurri's Tomb" and "The Gates of Hell Await."</TE>
<TE>   It seemed the evening might go the Italians' way when Christian
Vieri rose to head a corner kick powerfully into the back of the
Korean net in the 18th minute.</TE>
<TE>   It was Vieri's fourth goal of the tournament and ninth overall in
World Cup play, tying him for the all-time Italian record with Paolo
Rossi and Roberto Baggio.</TE>
<TE>   After gaining the lead, Italy Coach Giovanni Trapattoni's troops
settled down to hold the fort. They succeeded until the 88th minute,
when Panucci failed to control the ball and watched in horror as Seol
sneaked in to steal it from him before angling a shot into the lower
right corner of the net, beyond Buffon's reach.</TE>
<TE>   The goal produced an explosion of joy in the stands, where the
fans also held aloft signs that read: "Again 1966," a reference to
North Korea's famous victory over Italy in the 1966 World Cup in
England.</TE>
<TE>   Trapattoni was livid after the game because of the red card
ejection of influential playmaker Francesco Totti, who was tossed out
in the 103rd minute by referee Byron Moreno of Ecuador after diving
in the box in an effort to draw a penalty kick.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand why my player was dismissed," Trapattoni said.
"There were some bizarre decisions in some situations."</TE>
<TE>   There also was controversy over an Italian goal that was nullified
in overtime because of an offsides call, which appeared in replays to
have been a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   That said, Trapattoni was gracious toward the winners, even though
his team had joined Argentina, France and Portugal among the game's
giants to be ousted from the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "They [the South Koreans] played with a lot of heart," he said.
"It was a match full of emotion, a beautiful match, but Italy should
have won."</TE>
<TE>   It didn't and South Korea is in the final eight.</TE>
<TE>   "The dream is going on," Hiddink said. "Two or three months ago, I
wouldn't have thought it possible."</TE>
<TE>   The fireworks lighting the night sky in cities all over South
Korea said that it was.</TE>

<TE>   Golden Goals</TE>
<TE>   FIFA authorized the use of sudden-death overtime--won by the
so-called "Golden Goal"--in 1996 for tournament play, as a way of
encouraging teams to attack rather than play for a penalty-kick
shootout. Here are some of the more significant Golden Goals:</TE>
<TE>*--*

<HD>Navratilova Gets Singles Victory</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Martina Navratilova was back doing what she loved--playing singles,
serving and volleying on grass, and winning.</LD>
<LD>   In her first tour singles match in eight years, Navratilova
defeated Tatiana Panova of Russia, 6-1, 4-6, 6-2, Tuesday at
Eastbourne, England, a Wimbledon warmup she won 11 times.</LD>
<LD>   The victory made her the oldest woman to win a WTA match.
Navratilova, a nine-time Wimbledon champion, is 45. Panova is 25.</LD>
<TE>   Navratilova displayed the serve-and-volley game that made her one
of the greatest grasscourt players in history.</TE>
<TE>   "It was fun," she said. "It's always more fun when you win. That's
the whole point why I'm here, playing doubles and now playing
singles.... I didn't really expect anything. I expected to have a
good time and to do the best I could and see what that's good for."</TE>
<TE>   Navratilova said people shouldn't consider her victory over the
22nd-ranked Panova as a sign of weakness in the women's game.</TE>
<TE>   "That would really make me mad, because when Michael Jordan comes
back he still makes an All-Star team and plays well because he's
great," she said. "And I can still play this game and certainly I can
still play it on grass. So don't look at the age, look at the
ability."</TE>
<TE>   Navratilova won 167 singles and 166 doubles titles in her career,
including three Australian, two French and four U.S. Opens.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lleyton Hewitt's title chances at Wimbledon will be tested early.</TE>
<TE>   The top-seeded Australian was drawn to face veteran Jonas Bjorkman
of Sweden in a potentially tricky opening-round men's match in the
tournament, which starts Monday.</TE>
<TE>   In the women's draw, sisters Venus and Serena Williams are seeded
1-2 and could meet in a Grand Slam final for the third time in 10
months.</TE>
<TE>   In the men's draw, Marat Safin was seeded No. 2, followed by Andre
Agassi, Tim Henman, Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Pete Sampras.</TE>
<TE>   Sampras and Agassi are in different brackets and could only meet
in the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   In the women's draw, Jennifer Capriati was seeded No. 3, followed
by Monica Seles, Kim Clijsters and Justin Henin.</TE>
<TE>   Venus Williams, the two-time defending women's champion, plays
19-year-old British wild card Jane O'Donoghue in the first round and
Serena Williams plays Australia's Evie Dominikovic.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The top-seeded Hewitt outlasted Michael Chang, 7-6 (2), 7-6 (4),
in the first round of the Ordina Open at Den Bosch, Netherlands....
Top-seeded Andy Roddick defeated Bjorkman, 7-5, 7-5, in the first
round of the Samsung Open at Nottingham, England.</TE>
<TE>   Golf</TE>
<TE>   The national rating for the U.S. Open on Sunday was an 8.9 with a
22 share, which translates to 38 million viewers. The overnight
rating, released Monday, was a 9.3.</TE>
<TE>   The 8.9 national rating for Tiger Woods' victory is the
fourth-highest rating in U.S. Open history, according to Nielsen
figures that date to 1960. Although ABC got the same rating in 1981,
there hasn't been a higher number since ABC got a 9.4/32 in 1973.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, when Retief Goosen won, NBC got a 7.2/19 for the final
round. When Woods won in 2000 at Pebble Beach, the final round drew
an 8.1/21.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's third round got a national rating of 6.0/17, the best
Saturday performance since 1982.</TE>

<TE>   Former Denver Bronco quarterback John Elway will be part owner of

Lauderdale, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Hockey</TE>
<TE>   The Carolina Hurricanes rewarded Coach Paul Maurice and General
Manager Jim Rutherford for the team's surprising run to the Stanley

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>Even after two bloop run-scoring singles, Ben Sheets isn't a big fan
of the batter's box.</LD>
<LD>   "I still don't like to hit," said Sheets, a career .111 batter. "I
don't mind standing on first base. But that's probably my least
favorite part of the game. I enjoy what I do on the mound first and
foremost and even tonight, with two hits, I still like what happened
on the mound."</LD>
<LD>   Sheets pitched a seven-hitter for his second career complete game
and the Milwaukee Brewers defeated the Houston Astros, 7-1, Tuesday
night.</LD>
<TE>   Sheets (4-7) walked three and struck out seven in his first
complete game since May 29, 2001, at St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   The Brewers took some time to figure out right-hander Kirk
Saarloos, who lost his major league debut. Saarloos didn't give up a
hit until the fourth, when Tyler Houston led off with his fifth homer
for a 1-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   But in the fifth, Saarloos gave up five runs and four hits,
including one of Sheets' singles.</TE>
<TE>   Sheets' bloop single to left-center scored Alex Ochoa from third
base and made it 2-0. Houston added a sacrifice fly and Richie Sexson
an RBI single before Nelson Cruz came in and gave up a two-run triple
to Ryan Thompson.</TE>

<HD>Tracy Goes Ape When All-Stars Are Mentioned</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I mentioned All-Stars, and the lack of attention being given to the
Angels and Dodgers currently, and right away Manager Jim Tracy
brought up the Rally Monkey.</LD>
<LD>   Now there's no question the Monkey is a more exciting performer
than anyone wearing Dodger Blue or Little League Red these days, and
very deserving of All-Star consideration. He's certainly having a
better year than Adrian Beltre or Mark Grudzielanek, and I wouldn't
be opposed to a two-for-one deal with the Angels when the pennant
race really heats up and the Dodgers need some late-inning magic.</LD>
<LD>   But I was a little surprised to find the manager of the Dodgers
speaking so openly about stuffing the ballot box when he knew very
well there's no category for team mascots.</LD>
<TE>   I misunderstood: The manager of the Dodgers was speaking openly
about stuffing the ballot box with the Angels' team mascot.</TE>
<TE>   "Found the Rally Monkey's two eyes on the floor this morning when
I sat down for breakfast," Tracy said with unusual glee. "My three
boys gave the Rally Monkey to Maggie [the family dog], and she tore
that sucker up. Maggie's not a big fan of the Rally Monkey.''</TE>
<TE>   I know how baseball people think, so Angel Manager Mike Scioscia
is going to want to retaliate, and watching my own dog's experiences
let me just say Paul Lo Duca Bobblehead dolls seem to make real good
chew bones.</TE>
<TE>   I don't recommend Tom Lasorda Bobbleheads, however. Too much
baloney.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW I tried to get Tracy back on track talking baseball and
All-Stars, but he was still licking his chops. "I picked up the
Monkey's eyes because I didn't want Maggie to choke on them," he
said, and breakfast must be a heartwarming experience in the Tracy
household.</TE>
<TE>   I told Tracy I found it odd baseball released All-Star balloting
results this week, and of the 80 players mentioned in both leagues,
the Dodgers had only a catcher sitting fourth, and the Angels a third
baseman fifth at his position.</TE>
<TE>   The National and American Leagues listed 15 outfielders each, and
there was no mention of Shawn Green, Darin Erstad or Garrett
Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   "What's the matter with Eric Gagne?" Tracy said, and I presume the
Knucklehead knows Gagne is not an outfielder.</TE>
<TE>   I'm also guessing, that like most of you, Tracy hasn't punched out
his All-Star ballot yet--or ever--because there are no pitchers
listed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE DODGERS began the night with four more wins at this time of
the season than last year and were one game out of first. The Angels
began the night seven games better than a year ago and one game out
of first, and yet no one seems enthralled with the local talent from
either team.</TE>
<TE>   I've been writing about our crummy boring players for a couple of
years, but of course I was just kidding. I wouldn't have spent so
much time making Eric Karros into the .300 hitter he is today if I
thought he was going to be as terrible and horrible and pathetic as
he was a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Did I mention lousy, too?</TE>
<TE>   "What about our first baseman for All-Star consideration?" Tracy
said, and I've got to believe a year ago he would have tossed him to
Maggie. "With all that guy does for our ball club you could make a
pretty good argument."</TE>
<TE>   You work as hard as I have to get Green to not strike out every
time he comes to the plate, and yet still have enough energy to get
the best out of Tim Salmon, and you can understand why I'm interested
in these slugs getting some All-Star attention. In hindsight, I
probably should have spent some quality time with Brian Jordan, too.</TE>
<TE>   Now I hesitate to blame this All-Star indifference on the fans in
Los Angeles and Orange County because the Dodgers haven't won a
playoff game since 1988, the Angels since 1986, and so when it comes
to national profile and capturing a few votes elsewhere, well, forget
it. I wouldn't be surprised nationally if Ron Cey doesn't get more
votes at third base than Beltre this year.</TE>
<TE>   It's tough to win a popularity contest when you're no longer
popular, or have done anything memorable the last two decades.</TE>
<TE>   I have no idea how that's going to play with players like Green,
Lo Duca and Karros, who would probably like to add an All-Star game
to their resume, but if I'm Dodger management, I spare their
feelings, and tell them Maggie ate the ballots.</TE>
<TE>   As for the Angels, they just better hope the Rally Monkey doesn't
get more write-in votes than any of their players.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   EARLIER THIS week the Joe McDonnell radio show urged listeners to
call the president of the Coliseum Commission to let him know the
commission was at fault for L.A. not having a NFL team. McDonnell
gave out the commission president's phone number, and as you might
expect all of five of McDonnell's listeners called. Well, that's not
true. The commission president's office received five calls, all
right, but two of them came from Jeff in Tarzana.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THERE ARE reports Lindsey Hunter needs more time to decide whether
he wants to be paid almost $8 million over the next two years by the
Lakers, or look elsewhere for work.</TE>
<TE>   You can understand how a guy would want to make himself available
for a lead role in the event Hollywood elects to do a remake of the
movie, "The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Maryanne C.:</TE>
<TE>   "When the U.S. wins the World Cup you'll probably be one of the
first reporters to write about how proud you are of the guys, and
what a great thing this is for everybody."</TE>
<TE>   As long as somebody wakes me up.</TE>

<HD>No Leslie Is No Problem for Stingy Sparks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>The Sparks' problems started Tuesday morning, when Lisa Leslie was
too ill to participate in the shoot-around. Coach Michael Cooper said
his star center was resting, and he hoped she would be able to play
against the Seattle Storm.</LD>
<LD>   But when Leslie arrived at KeyArena for the game, she hadn't
shaken a flu virus. She was told not to play and watch from the
bench. She is considered day to day.</LD>
<LD>   Still the Sparks had few problems with the Storm, rolling to an
80-68 victory before 6,410.</LD>
<TE>   To compensate for their ailing star, the Sparks (8-1) stayed as
close as possible the first 30 minutes--including its 38-37 halftime
lead--before shutting down the Storm in the last 10 minutes. Seattle
(4-5) shot only 37.5%, but more importantly made only six of their
last 18 shots and had seven of their 18 turnovers in that final
stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile the Sparks, who shot 44.1% and got 23 points from Mwadi
Mabika and 20 from DeLisha Milton, closed out Seattle with 15-8 run
in the final five minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Lauren Jackson had 23 points for Seattle (and two for the Sparks
when she accidentally put a rebound back into the Los Angeles
basket), and Sue Bird had 12. But Bird had all of her points in the
first half, made only three of 10 shots, and had more turnovers (six)
than assists (five).</TE>
<TE>   "I keep telling people we're not a one-woman team," Cooper said.
"We believe that we're not a one-woman team. We proved it tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "Defensively I thought it was our best game since Houston. It was
something we needed to get back to. The past few games we've been
trying to win with just offense, but you need to play both."</TE>
<TE>   Echoing their coach were Spark guards Nikki McCrimmon and Tamecka
Dixon. McCrimmon had four points and four steals; she bottled up Bird
defensively, twice picking her clean at midcourt.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt other people have been giving her a lot of room so we
tried to pressure her more," Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon had 16 points on six-of-14 shooting, but also handed out
four assists and swung back and forth defensively on the Storm's
guards and small forwards.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a champion's confidence and the confidence of
experience," McCrimmon said. "We missed Lisa tonight, but on the
other hand we learned how to play last year when people were down. So
we came ready to play and to win for Lisa."</TE>
<TE>   "We knew we had to be solid tonight," Dixon said.</TE>
<TE>   And they more than compensated for the absence of the reigning
league most valuable player, and the WNBA's leading rebounder.</TE>
<TE>   While Leslie looked lethargic in the Spark locker room, she said
she wanted to play. But Cooper said it was best she did not.</TE>
<TE>   "After tonight we'll have a couple of days before we play
[Minnesota], and we'll see how she is then," Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   He was grateful the diagnosis was flu. Cooper remembered the
second-half collision Leslie had with Sacramento's La'Keshia Frett in
the Spark-Monarch game Saturday. Even though Leslie had finished the
game and looked OK on Sunday and Monday, Cooper said she soon
complained of feeling lightheaded and achy.</TE>
<TE>   Fearing a concussion, Cooper said, he had Leslie undergo a CAT
scan Tuesday morning, but the results were negative.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first game Leslie had missed since last July 25, when
she sat out against Sacramento because of a bruised knee.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Coach Lin Dunn could only shake her head at her young
team's blown chance.</TE>
<TE>   "We played a tough game tonight, but we did not play a complete
game," Dunn said. "We went away from some of the basics, and they
cost us. It was the little things that beat us tonight."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In other WNBA action:</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 78, Sacramento 63--Jennifer Gillom had 17 points, seven
rebounds and four assists to lead the Mercury (5-2) past the Monarchs
(1-6) at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Mercury assistant coach Linda Sharp won her first game in place of
Coach Cynthia Cooper, who remained in Houston on Tuesday after a
surrogate mother gave birth to Cooper's twins on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   In other news, forward Brandy Reed's comeback season ended when
the Mercury suspended her indefinitely for conduct detrimental to the
team--her second such suspension in 13 months. Reed missed all but
the first game of last season in a contract dispute.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 53, Miami 46--Sheryl Swoopes had 16 points as the Comets
(7-3) rallied from a 13-point deficit to beat the Sol (2-6) at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Utah 79, Indiana 71--Marie Ferdinand had a career-high 27 points
and Jennifer Azzi had a career-high 18 as the Starzz (6-3) beat the
Fever (4-5) at Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 75, Detroit 67--Chamique Holdsclaw scored 24 points at
Washington to help the Mystics (7-1) beat the Shock (0-10).</TE>
<TE>   Portland 59, Minnesota 51--Tamicha Jackson had 14 points, seven
assists and a career-high seven rebounds as the Fire (4-5) stopped
the Lynx (4-5) at Portland, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando 71, New York 62--Shannon Johnson scored 25 points,
including six in Orlando's deciding 10-0 run, and the Miracle (4-3)
beat the Liberty (7-4) for the first time at Madison Square Garden.</TE>

<HD>Japan Runs Into End of the Road, 1-0</HD>
<DH>World Cup: Co-host country ousted, coach resigns after loss
to Turkey in second round.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a span of 90 rain-soaked minutes Tuesday, Japan lost its spot in
the World Cup, its head-to-head competition with co-host South Korea
and its soccer coach.</LD>
<LD>   Hours before South Korea advanced to the quarterfinals with its
upset victory over Italy, Japan went out in the second round, losing
to Turkey, 1-0, before 45,000 disappointed supporters in Miyagi.</LD>
<LD>   One loss led to another, with Philippe Troussier, the Frenchman
who had coached Japan to its first World Cup victories, resigning his
position immediately after the match.</LD>
<TE>   "This great Japanese adventure is now over," a tearful Troussier
said. "Today, I was proud to be their trainer and to have worn the
Japanese shirt for four years."</TE>
<TE>   Japan, winner of Group H, was considered the favorite over Group C
runner-up Turkey, which began the match with a lineup depleted by
suspensions and injuries. But the Turks, who gave Brazil a scare in
their tournament-opening 2-1 defeat, got a 12th-minute goal from Umit
Davala and protected it with relentless defending.</TE>
<TE>   "Turkish people like a tough atmosphere," Turkey Coach Senol Gunes
said. "We came together and produced our best football. These things
never affect us, and perhaps our opponents weren't aware of this."</TE>
<TE>   Turkey advances to a most improbable quarterfinal pairing against
Senegal. That match will be played Saturday in Osaka.</TE>
<TE>   During group play, Japan's full-field attacking strategy helped
masked defensive deficiencies that were exposed and exploited by
Turkey. First, in the 12th minute, defender Koji Nakata needlessly
conceded a corner. Then goalkeeper Seigo Narazaki wandered off his
line and was beaten inside the near post by Davala's header from a
corner by Ergun Penbe.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the loss, Troussier declared the tournament a success for
Japanese soccer.</TE>
<TE>   "I say bravo to this Japanese team," he said. "I would tell the
Japanese players to believe in their potential and their capacity to
succeed. They have proved they can take on the top teams in the world
and there is some recognition in European football now of our
players."</TE>
<TE>   Gunes said the Japanese team "should not be sad because they have
done a tremendous job in the last four years." He added the Turks
"also represent Japan now," which, though a nice gesture, is not
quite the result Japan wanted to take from its first appearance in
the World Cup's round of 16.</TE>

<DH>What a world of difference four years make for American
soccer</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>Some of the more memorable comments to emerge from the debris of the
United States' 1998 World Cup campaign in France were made by Bob
Gansler, the man who coached the U.S. team at the Italy '90 World
Cup.</LD>
<LD>   "I still think some folks have been unrealistic, thinking that
because this is America we can have a miracle on ice on any given
day, on any given surface," Gansler told Soccer America magazine.</LD>
<LD>   "Progress is being made and people should be happy about it. This
World Cup performance was not a death knell. It wasn't Armageddon."</LD>
<TE>   No more compelling evidence exists for that argument than the
performance of the U.S. team at Korea/Japan '02. The 32-nation
tournament has reached its quarterfinal stage, and Coach Bruce
Arena's team still is involved.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday night, in the South Korean city of Ulsan, the U.S. plays
three-time world champion Germany for a place in the semifinals. Such
a scenario would have been unthinkable--indeed, laughable--only four
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   So what has changed? What has turned the Americans from
international nobodies to viable players on the world stage?</TE>
<TE>   The answer is everything and nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, the team has changed, but not entirely. Of the 23
players on the roster, 11 were on Coach Steve Sampson's 1998 team
that went 0-3 and disintegrated amid squabbling over who was to blame
and why. Two players, backup goalkeepers Kasey Keller and Tony Meola,
were on Gansler's 1990 team that also went 0-3 but did not fall apart
internally.</TE>
<TE>   "We were just talking about that in the shower," Meola said
Monday, shortly after the U.S. had beaten Mexico to secure its
quarterfinal berth. "Twelve years ago, we would never have thought
we'd be here, in the final eight, and deserve to be here. We've done
quite well."</TE>
<TE>   Meola's understatement is natural. Because of the debacle of '98,
expectations of success at this World Cup were low among fans and the
media. Only the coaches and players themselves showed any great
belief in the team.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Soccer Federation, meanwhile, was determined to erase the
stigma of 1998's last-place finish, no matter how much it cost.</TE>
<TE>   The determination to do better both on and off the field was
reflected in a comment by Robert Contiguglia, the federation's
president.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like to think too much on '98," he said. "I get ulcers
when I think about it."</TE>
<TE>   To make the memory go away, millions of dollars have been spent on
this team, with the money going toward everything from such
high-price items as the chartered airplane that flew the team to
Daegu for its match against South Korea to such unlikely items as
baby-sitters for the players' children and exclusive use of the sauna
at the team's luxury hotel in Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   Cost has been no object, or at least not a serious one.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of it is due to Bruce being very stern in his demands [of
U.S. Soccer]," starting goalkeeper Brad Friedel said Tuesday. "He
took everything from the 1990, 1994 and 1998 World Cups and I'm
guessing he put them into two columns: what was good and what was
bad.</TE>
<TE>   "The ones that are bad usually cost money [to fix]. There are
loads of little things that add up to big dollars. Some of these
younger players might not realize the strides that have been made. I
remember when we were playing for $50 a game. Now we're not doing
that. They have done a fantastic job this time and we [the players]
have let them know it."</TE>
<TE>   Arena took over as coach in November 1998 and immediately set
about not only recasting the team but cleansing the atmosphere
surrounding it. He said he did not want to dwell on past failures.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one thing we tried to do," he said, "to put 1998 behind us
as quickly as we could in order to try to rebuild and try to make it
better."</TE>
<TE>   Judged on results alone, he has succeeded. But the credit also
goes to the players, especially the survivors of 1998's
crash-and-burn experience.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to get a chance to come back and hopefully put things
right," midfielder and team captain Claudio Reyna said shortly before
the World Cup began. "The setup has already been much better without
even playing our first game. In 1998, before we kicked a ball, it was
already a mess.</TE>
<TE>   "The entire preparation, the atmosphere and attitude of the whole
team has been very good, and hopefully it will pay off."</TE>
<TE>   Even players who were not in France, such as Landon Donovan, who
was only 16 then, have realized the importance of doing well in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the players have completely forgotten about France,"
Donovan said. "Obviously, I wasn't there, but from what I gather it's
not like it weighs on the players [who were there], like they have to
make up for what happened in France.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a good aura around this team that says, 'It's
over, it happened.' We want to start anew and we just want to show
what we have this time as opposed to making up for last time."</TE>
<TE>   With 1998 acting as a spur and the federation's willingness to
spend whatever it took to clear the way, the path to success was
open. All that was needed was for Arena to select the correct players
and devise the right tactics for each game.</TE>
<TE>   So far he has succeeded on both fronts.</TE>
<TE>   His astute management of the team is demonstrated by the fact that
19 of the 23 players have been on the field in this World Cup, that
there is no behind-the-scenes unhappiness, that everyone is pulling
together.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a great opportunity for us to show the world that we can
be a good team," Arena told his players before the opening game
against Portugal in Suwon, South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. came into that game with an unenviable record in the
World Cup. After failing to qualify for 40 years, it went a combined
1-8-1 in the tournaments of 1990, 1994 and 1998.</TE>
<TE>   In those 10 matches, the Americans were outscored, 17-6, and the
U.S. managed only one goal--by Brian McBride against Iran in 1998--in
its last five matches.</TE>
<TE>   This time, it has been different. The U.S. is 2-1-1 going into
Friday's game against Germany and has outscored Portugal, South
Korea, Poland and Mexico, 7-6.</TE>
<TE>   McBride, who has scored twice in this tournament, recalled what it
was like after losing to Germany in the opening game of the 1998
World Cup, compared to beating Portugal in the 2002 opener.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember getting on the bus after the Germany game--our buses
were right next to each other," he said. "Everyone was looking over
and [the German players] were all laughing, playing cards and having
a great time. So to come out of this game [with a 3-2 victory over
Portugal] was a great feeling."</TE>
<TE>   A subsequent tie against South Korea, loss to Poland and defeat of
Mexico has positioned the U.S. players so that no matter what happens
against Germany they can return home with heads held high.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing we are going to be measured on in America is our
success," Meola said. "American fans have been blessed with winners
in every sport. We live for that in our country."</TE>
<TE>   Arena realizes that huge steps have been made at this World Cup,
but cautions that the journey is only beginning.</TE>
<TE>   "It speaks well for the future of the game in the United States,"
he said. "We're still behind the powers, but I think we're making
progress. We need to be patient, but we're moving forward."</TE>

<HD>Donovan Will Probably Turn in His MLS Uniform</HD>

<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>Landon Donovan, who scored the United States' second goal in its 2-0
victory over Mexico on Monday, probably will leave Major League
Soccer and return to Europe later this year.</LD>
<LD>   Donovan came to MLS in 2001 to play for the San Jose Earthquakes
and helped them win the league championship last season, but his
contract still is owned by Bayer Leverkusen, the club he joined as a
teenager and probably will rejoin.</LD>
<LD>   "I think he should do that," U.S. Coach Bruce Arena said Tuesday.
"I think that's what he will be doing, if I'm not mistaken, after the
MLS season."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Goalkeeper Brad Friedel, the former UCLA player who has been a
starter for Blackburn Rovers of the English Premier League for the
last two seasons, is certain that playing in Europe is more
beneficial to a player's growth than playing in MLS, but said the
league has its place.</TE>
<TE>   "It has a very big place," he said, "but you could learn more in
Europe in one season than you could in a 10-year career in MLS.
That's just a fact.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not to say that MLS won't get to that point, but right now
it's a new league. I mean, there are more than 100 years of
traditions in the European leagues and South American leagues."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   By playing against Mexico on Monday, midfielders Cobi Jones and
Earnie Stewart broke former national team player Tab Ramos' record of
appearing in nine World Cup matches.</TE>
<TE>   Jones and Stewart now have 10 apiece ... and counting.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Veteran Mexico midfielder Alberto Garcia Aspe, 35, announced his
retirement from the national team one day after its World Cup loss to
the U.S.</TE>

<HD>In L.A., Univision Outdraws ESPN on U.S. Soccer Upset</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Univision's Spanish-language coverage of the United States' 2-0 World
Cup victory over Mexico drew more than 3 1/2 times as many viewers in
Los Angeles than ESPN's coverage.</LD>
<LD>   According to cable ratings made available Tuesday, ESPN got a 3.1
rating with an 8 share in L.A. for the game that began at 11:30 p.m.
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The Univision coverage on Channel 34 earned an 11.5/32, according
to over-the-air broadcast ratings made available Monday.</LD>
<TE>   In Hispanic households, the game got a 41.2/75, which means
Channel 34's coverage was seen in 648,000 of the L.A. market's 1.573
million Hispanic households. That translates to 1.5 million Hispanic
viewers.</TE>
<TE>   The 3.1 ESPN rating translates to 165,000 homes and an estimated
400,000 viewers.</TE>
<TE>   The combined L.A. rating for the U.S.-Mexico game on Channel 34
and ESPN was a 14.6/40, almost double the L.A. rating of 7.8/20 for
Sunday's final round of the U.S. Open golf on NBC.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, ESPN got a 2.29 rating for the soccer match, which
translates to 1.98 million homes and roughly about 5 million viewers.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S.-Mexico game was the most-watched program on cable
television over the weekend among men 18-34, getting a 4.28 rating in
that demographic category. Also among men 18-34, it was the
most-viewed program in history on cable television in its late-night
time slot.</TE>
<TE>   Through 17 late-night/early-morning World Cup telecasts, ESPN is
averaging a 0.86 rating. During the same time slots last year, ESPN
was averaging a 0.33.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The U.S.-Germany quarterfinal match will be televised live by
Univision and ESPN at 4:30 a.m. Friday, and will be replayed on ABC
Saturday at 10:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   ABC contemplated taking the game away from ESPN and showing it
live Friday, but scrapped that idea. The main problem was that the
game starts at 7:30 a.m. in the East, so "Good Morning America" would
have to be preempted.</TE>
<TE>   ABC has the option of taking live games away from ESPN and showing
them on tape-delay, and the network has done that four times during
the World Cup. But three other times ABC has waived that right and
allowed ESPN to show a game live that will be shown later on ABC. And
that's what it is doing with U.S. versus Germany.</TE>

<HD>Ducks, Smirnov Reach Agreement</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Mighty Ducks signed left wing Alexei Smirnov, their first-round
pick in the 2000 draft, Tuesday. He agreed to a three-year contract
that will pay him $1.75-million a season and a $1.125-million signing
bonus.</LD>
<LD>   The hope is that Smirnov, 20, will give the Ducks toughness up
front, something General Manager Bryan Murray said the team lacks.
Smirnov is 6 feet 3, 211 pounds with breakaway speed, according to
scouting reports.</LD>
<LD>   "He is a big, strong, pretty hard-working kid," Murray said. "He
has some ability to score. He won't be a big goal scorer, but he has
the size to play in the corners and be a contributor offensively."</LD>
<TE>   Smirnov slipped in the 2000 draft, as teams were concerned about
his consistency. He was rated the third-best skater in Europe before
the draft, but was available when the Ducks made him the 12th overall
pick.</TE>
<TE>   But Smirnov was impressive when he attended the Ducks' training
camp in 2000 and played well for CSKA of the Russian Hockey League
last season. He had five goals and 16 points in 48 games.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks are continuing talks to sign forward Stanislav Chistov
this weekend at the NHL draft. Chistov, the team's top pick and the
fifth player taken in 2001, is in New York after being released from
a two-year commitment in the Russia army.</TE>
<TE>   Murray also has to sign a large group of restricted free agents,
including forwards Paul Kariya, Matt Cullen and Steve Rucchin,
defensemen Ruslan Salei, Vitaly Vishnevski and Pavel Trnka and goalie
Steve Shields. Kariya, Cullen, Rucchin, Salei and Shields are
eligible for arbitration.</TE>

<KH>BOYS' TRACK AND FIELD ATHLETE OF THE YEAR</KH>
<HD>Bruno Finished With a Flourish</HD>
<DH>Trabuco Hills sprinter overcame injuries to conclude high
school career by winning state championships in the 100 and 200
meters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ORTEGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many track and field athletes will tell you there is a fine line
between being eager for a competition and being anxious.</LD>
<LD>   Sprinter Matt Bruno of Mission Viejo Trabuco Hills High isn't one
of them.</LD>
<LD>   He says the more uneasy he is before a race, the better. The more
fearful he is of being beaten, the better he competes.</LD>
<TE>   "The more nervous I am, the more the adrenaline gets flowing,"
Bruno said. "All of that adrenaline helps me explode out of the
blocks."</TE>
<TE>   Bruno, a 5-foot-9, 165-pound senior who has signed with UCLA, got
off to four good starts in the state track and field championships
May 31 and June 1 at Cerritos College. The last two contributed to
his victories in the finals of the 100 and 200 meters and cemented
his selection as The Times' boys' track and field athlete of the
year.</TE>
<TE>   "He was bouncing off the walls," Coach Steve Miller said of
Bruno's demeanor on the final day of the state championships. "We had
to calm him down a little bit before he ran."</TE>
<TE>   Bruno, who will run in the USA Track &amp; Field Junior (age 19 and
under) championships at Palo Alto on Friday and Saturday, was one of
the leaders coming out of the starting blocks in the 100 and he took
the lead within the first 20 meters of the 200.</TE>
<TE>   That spelled doom for the rest of the field.</TE>
<TE>   Bruno won the 100 in 10.55 seconds, .17 seconds ahead of runner-up
Rubin Williams of San Jose Valley Christian. Bruno's 20.82 was an
all-time best in the 200 and left him a tenth of a second ahead of
second-place Williams. The time moved him into a three-way tie for
eighth on the all-time Southern Section list.</TE>
<TE>   "Before the 100, my attitude was, 'I can't lose,' " Bruno said. "
'I don't know how I'm going to handle it if I lose, so I can't lose.'
I had everything to lose. Nothing to gain. That was my attitude going
into that race."</TE>
<TE>   Bruno was more relieved than happy at winning the 100, but when
the 200 was run 50 minutes later, he was thinking it would be "really
cool" to be a double state champion.</TE>
<TE>   "My attitude before the 200 was, 'It's my last [high school
race],' " Bruno said. "So I was just going to put it all out on the
track.... I figured if I got out to an early lead, [Williams] would
have a hard time catching me."</TE>
<TE>   Bruno wasn't boasting.</TE>
<TE>   He was stating what many high school track fans in California
already knew. He has better top-end speed than anybody else in the
state.</TE>
<TE>   "We really worked on his start this year," Miller said. "Because
that was his weakness before. Once he gets out and starts running
tall, he's very efficient."</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean Bruno's season was perfect.</TE>
<TE>   He lost training time because of a groin injury in March and
tendinitis in his right foot in April.</TE>
<TE>   He was defeated by junior Deun White of San Diego Rancho Bernardo
in the 200 in the Trabuco Hills Invitational on March 30 and by
sophomore Derrick Jones of Long Beach Poly in the 200 in the Division
I final of the Southern Section championships on May 18.</TE>
<TE>   Jones' victory prevented Bruno from winning the 100 and 200 in
that meet and spurred him to winning and posting the best times of
his career in the 100 (10.48) and in the 200 (20.93) in the Southern
Section Masters Meet the following week.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted to make a statement," Miller said about the Masters
Meet. "He wanted to show people that he messed up the week before by
not getting enough sleep the night before the meet. That what
happened before wasn't going to happen again."</TE>

<KH>GIRLS' TRACK AND FIELD ATHLETE OF THE YEAR</KH>
<HD>Key for Felix Is One-Track Mind</HD>
<DH>L.A. Baptist junior won two state sprint titles this season
thanks to 'laser-like focus.' Her 22.83 in 200 is third-best mark
all-time in nation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ORTEGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A girl doesn't run 11.40 seconds for 100 meters or 22.83 for 200 at
the age of 16 without possessing an abundance of physical talent.</LD>
<LD>   But having a high percentage of fast-twitch muscle fibers and long
legs are not the primary reasons junior Allyson Felix of North Hills
L.A. Baptist High is such a superb sprinter.</LD>
<LD>   The thing that sets The Times' girls' track and field athlete of
the year apart from others, according to L.A. Baptist sprint coach
Jonathan Patton, is her determination.</LD>
<TE>   "She does have a lot of God-given [physical] gifts," Patton said.
"But it's that drive she has that separates her from a lot of other
very talented sprinters. You can see it in the way she trains [on the
track], in the weight room, in her diet, in the way she prepares for
races and in the way she carries herself on race day. She just has
that laser-like focus. She wants to not just win, but be her best."</TE>
<TE>   That quest to be her best was evident June 1, the final day of the
state championships at Cerritos College.</TE>
<TE>   Felix, who anchored L.A. Baptist to a sixth-place finish in the
400 relay to start the track portion of the meet, won her second
consecutive 100 title with an 11.55 clocking while running into a
wind of 1.3 meters per second.</TE>
<TE>   But she was upset she had to come from behind to defeat sophomore
Shalonda Solomon of Long Beach Poly.</TE>
<TE>   "She just kind of stomped back to the [area where our stuff was],"
Patton said. "She didn't want to be told what she did wrong, but she
didn't want to be congratulated either. She just said, 'I can't wait
for that 200 meters.' "</TE>
<TE>   Felix won the 200 by a monstrous .53 seconds with a 22.83 clocking
that was the fastest in the nation this year and moved her to third
on the all-time national list.</TE>
<TE>   Marion Jones set the national high school record of 22.58 for
Thousand Oaks in 1992 and Chandra Cheeseborough ran 22.77 at high
altitude--where the thinner air is less of a hindrance for
sprinters--for Gainesville (Fla.) Ribault in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely was mad," Felix said about the 100. "Because I was
hitting all my [practice] starts before the race. I thought I was
ready to hit it in the race, but I didn't."</TE>
<TE>   The victory in the 200 improved upon Felix's runner-up finish in
last year's state championships, but she sustained a "small" strain
in her right hamstring with about 20 meters left in the race.</TE>
<TE>   The injury kept her out of the National Scholastic Outdoor
championships at North Carolina State last weekend, but she plans to
run the 200 in the USA Track &amp; Field Junior (age 19 and under)
championships on Friday and Saturday at Palo Alto.</TE>
<TE>   A top-two finish in the junior meet would earn Felix a spot on the
U.S. team that will compete in the World Junior championships July
16-21 at Kingston, Jamaica. But she also plans to run the 200 in the
senior portion of the national championships, which will be held in
conjunction with the junior meet.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want this to sound arrogant to other people," Patton
said. "But we want to see what she can do when she's in a race with
people who have run faster than her or who are at the same level as
her. She hasn't been able to do that [during the outdoor season]."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the relative lack of competition, the unassuming Felix has
broken 23 seconds four times in the 200 this season and lowered her
100 best to 11.40 to move to fifth on the all-time state list.</TE>
<TE>   "Breaking 23 was something that was in the back of my mind," Felix
said about her preseason goals. "But I didn't want to talk about it
and then have to live up to it. I just wanted to see if I could do
it."</TE>

<KH>Lonnie White /  ON THE NHL</KH>
<HD>Labor Problems Are on Horizon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although I believe that the NHL season is too long, Commissioner Gary
Bettman has reason to feel good about the league.</LD>
<LD>   Riding the success of the popular Detroit Red Wings, television
ratings were up for the Stanley Cup playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   ABC's coverage of the finals posted a national rating 9% higher
than last season, which included a 13% increase among males aged
18-34.</LD>
<TE>   The league's attendance during the playoffs also increased. Arenas
were filled to 99.9% capacity with an average attendance of 18,791,
which exceeded the previous record of 18,419, set last season.</TE>
<TE>   But before Bettman breaks his arm patting himself on the back,
there are a couple of things the league needs to address.</TE>
<TE>   Topping the list is the NHL's financial state. With their
$65-million payroll, the Red Wings did not spend the most money in
the league, but they were close. The success Detroit had after adding
such big-contract players as Dominik Hasek, Brett Hull and Luc
Robitaille will likely motivate deep-pocket franchises such as the
New York Rangers and Colorado Avalanche to spend even more money.</TE>
<TE>   With the collective bargaining agreement scheduled to expire Sept.
15, 2004 and the NHL becoming more a league of haves and have-nots,
Bettman will have to perform his best spin job to keep things
harmonious.</TE>
<TE>   That's why in his recent state-of-the-league address Bettman made
sure he discussed economics. The commissioner didn't hesitate to say
the league required a new economic system and made another public
appeal to the NHL Players' Assn. to begin talks toward a new
collective bargaining agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "We remain prepared, available and eager, any time, anyplace, any
day, to undertake substantive dialogue with the players' association
on a new collective bargaining agreement," Bettman said in his
attempt to make the players' union the bad guy before the labor
battle even begins.</TE>
<TE>   Bettman and the league owners want some sort of salary cap but do
not want revenue sharing. Union chief Bob Goodenow and the NHLPA
oppose a salary cap but would not mind seeing some of the financially
stronger franchises share their profits with other teams.</TE>
<TE>   That's not the case right now. Even with Carolina and its modest
payroll making an unexpected run to the finals, that doesn't mean the
Hurricanes will be favorites to win the Stanley Cup next season
unless they are willing to spend money this summer to keep pace with
more financially capable franchises such as the Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   The NHL can't afford to follow the path of Major League Baseball,
which already has a class system and continues to have labor issues.
Bettman understands this. He knows his league's shortcomings as well
as anyone, and that's why he's speaking out now even with two seasons
left on the CBA.</TE>
<TE>   Bettman may be just posturing, but unless something is worked out
sooner than later, the NHL appears headed for some type of work
stoppage, which would not be good for anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Down and Out in Buffalo</TE>
<TE>   The status of the Buffalo Sabres is uncertain because of the
economic crisis facing owner John J. Rigas and his family.</TE>
<TE>   Grand juries in two states are investigating financial
transactions between Rigas-founded Adelphia Communications, the
nation's sixth-largest cable TV company, and the Rigas family.</TE>
<TE>   Among the questions is whether Rigas used Adelphia funds to
purchase the NHL team without the approval of Adelphia stockholders.</TE>
<TE>   The NHL is hoping that a locally controlled investor group is able
to step in and keep the Sabres in Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   According to league sources, Buffalo businessman Mark E. Hamister,
who owns the Buffalo Destroyers of the Arena Football League, is the
main person behind the investment group, with help from Boston Bruin
owner Jeremy M. Jacobs, who has been very involved in advising the
group.</TE>
<TE>   Another option could be for the Sabres to be purchased by an
out-of-town investor group. That may be a longshot because of a
strong nonrelocation agreement in the team's lease with local
governments.</TE>
<TE>   But until the ownership issue can be resolved, the league may be
forced to take over the franchise.</TE>
<TE>   No Rush to Find Scotty's Replacement</TE>
<TE>   According to Detroit owner Mike Ilitch, the Red Wings will take
their time hiring a replacement for Coach Scotty Bowman, who
announced his retirement after the Stanley Cup finals.</TE>
<TE>   Although many people around the league believe that longtime
assistant coaches Dave Lewis and Barry Smith should take over as
co-head coaches, Ilitch said the Red Wings will interview numerous
candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't afford to make a mistake with a coach, not with the
talent that we've got," Ilitch said.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the high number of veterans on their roster, the Red
Wings are expected to go through a transition stage, and Ilitch wants
his next coach to not only be able to attract future free agents but
also continue to develop young players.</TE>
<TE>   Remember, Bowman may have received a ton credit for getting his
future Hall of Famers to play together, but he also did a great job
of getting the most out of role players such as Tomas Holmstrom,
Darren McCarty, Jiri Fischer and Mathieu Dandenault, who were all
drafted by the Red Wings.</TE>
<TE>   Line Shifts</TE>
<TE>   Here are some items that you may or may not have heard about
throughout the NHL playoffs:</TE>
<TE>   At this week's Board of Governors meeting, the NHL will discuss
ways to make arenas safer for spectators--such as safety netting used
in Europe--following the death of 13-year-old Brittanie Cecil at a
Columbus Blue Jacket game this season.</TE>
<TE>   Without getting into specifics, Bettman said the league would not
make any decisions until he reviews a report being prepared by
engineers, architects and safety inspectors....</TE>
<TE>   Somewhat lost in the Red Wings' Stanley Cup celebrations was the
presence of former defenseman Vladimir Konstantinov, who attended
Detroit's Game 5 victory five years after being injured in a
limousine accident that left him partially paralyzed....</TE>
<TE>   Veteran coach Pat Burns was a great hire for New Jersey, which
fired Kevin Constantine one month after the Devils were eliminated in
the first round by the Hurricanes.</TE>
<TE>   Burns has a winning track record and he demands the most out of
his players, which is something the Devils, who have had four coaches
in four years, need.</TE>

<HD>Hope Fades for Finding 300 Missing in China Floods</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>Rescuers have all but given up hope of finding about 300 people
missing in floods in western China, an official said Tuesday,
suggesting that the death toll could top 500.</LD>
<LD>   Storms that raged June 8-10 ravaged areas across the west of
China, triggering flooding and mudslides that destroyed thousands of
houses and wrecked bridges and roads. Officials have reported 253
deaths.</LD>
<LD>   In Shaanxi province, where about 300 people have been reported
missing, efforts are "shifting from rescue to figuring out an
accurate death toll," said Li Wei, a spokesman for the provincial
government.</LD>
<TE>   Officials have said 152 people are confirmed dead in Shaanxi.
Authorities aren't declaring the missing people dead yet "because we
don't want to give up hope," Li said by telephone from the provincial
capital, Xian.</TE>
<TE>   More heavy rains are predicted for Shaanxi through the weekend,
the official China Daily newspaper said.</TE>

<HD>Pakistan Releases 1 of 2 Americans Accused of Illegal
Crossing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER and TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- The White House confirmed Tuesday that two U.S.
citizens were detained separately by Pakistan after allegedly trying
to enter the country from Afghanistan, and that one has been released
and has returned to the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Administration officials would not provide any details about the
identities of those involved or the circumstances of their
detentions. Senior Pakistani government officials said that neither
of the detainees appeared to have any terrorist connections.</LD>
<LD>   "We have looked into these reports and have confirmed that two
Americans--these are separate instances--were being detained in
Pakistan," White House spokesman Scott McClellan said. "As I
understand [it], one individual is back in the United States, no
longer being detained or in custody. The other individual is still in
the custody of Pakistan."</LD>
<TE>   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the man who
returned home "is neither under arrest nor in any form of detention"
in the U.S. The second man, Boucher said, could remain in custody in
Pakistan for several weeks while authorities there investigate him.</TE>
<TE>   Boucher also said the two men appear to be the only Americans
detained by Pakistan after having been in Afghanistan, despite
various news reports about several U.S. citizens having been taken
into custody.</TE>
<TE>   In Pakistan, authorities confirmed that they released one of the
Americans, and said both had been detained after they had crossed
illegally into the country's mountainous tribal areas from
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "They are U.S. citizens of Afghan origin, and there has been no
linkage established between them and Al Qaeda," said Rashid Qureshi,
spokesman for Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf. "We are treating
them as illegal border crossers."</TE>
<TE>   The second American was believed to be in custody in the Pakistani
town of Miram Shah, about 120 miles southwest of Peshawar.</TE>
<TE>   According to one news report, which could not be independently
confirmed, the men had crossed from Afghanistan's Paktia province and
were trying to coax local tribesmen to volunteer for the Afghan army.
There is much intermingling among residents on both sides of the
border, many of whom share tribal blood ties.</TE>
<TE>   News that the two Americans had been detained in the sensitive
border area with Afghanistan raised interest because it closely
followed the announcement of the arrest in Chicago of another U.S.
citizen, Jose Padilla, allegedly after he had met in Pakistan with
operatives of Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network to plot
attacks in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   American authorities, who closely trailed Padilla on his return
journey from Pakistan to Chicago's O'Hare International Airport,
where he was arrested May 8, say that he was on a mission to build
and detonate a bomb capable of emitting nuclear radiation--a
so-called "dirty" bomb.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani officials have questioned that claim, portraying
Padilla, also known as Abdullah al Muhajir, as a petty criminal with
grand ideas but limited abilities.</TE>
<TE>   Meyer reported from Washington and Marshall from Peshawar.</TE>

<HD>EU Expands Terror Blacklist, Adding Five Palestinian Groups</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BRUSSELS</DL>
<LD>The European Union published an expanded blacklist of terrorist
organizations Tuesday that added five Palestinian groups, including
one linked to Yasser Arafat, to those liable to face asset freezes
and other sanctions.</LD>
<LD>   The new additions bring the EU list largely in line with one drawn
up by the United States in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</LD>
<LD>   The new list includes the Jewish extremist group Kahane Chai, the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, and four individuals
accused of belonging to the Basque separatist group ETA, which has
carried out hundreds of bombings and shootings in Spain.</LD>
<TE>   Although the list was approved by EU foreign ministers, it does
not mean that those on it will automatically face punitive measures.
It is entirely up to individual governments to implement sanctions or
asset freezes.</TE>
<TE>   The new list includes the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, which is linked
to Arafat's Fatah movement. Al Aqsa has claimed responsibility for a
number of suicide attacks on Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Also added were the Palestine Liberation Front; the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine; the Abu Nidal Organization; and the
Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, a U.S.-based charity
that has been accused of channeling funds to the militant Palestinian
group Hamas.</TE>
<TE>   Israel welcomed the decision to add the Palestinian groups but
expressed disappointment that the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, which
targets Israel from Lebanon, was not included.</TE>

<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>The bespectacled graduate student waited on the curb of a
working-class neighborhood for the No. 32 bus, then scrambled up the
steps behind an elderly Jewish man. Mohammed Ghoul was 22. He wore
red Tuesday, clutched a bomb stuffed with nails and went forth into
the brilliant morning "to kill and be killed."</LD>
<LD>   The bus that crawled through the bleating traffic on the outskirts
of Jerusalem was crowded with schoolchildren, older students and
blue-collar workers nearing retirement. A pregnant woman. The Israeli
president's longtime maid. A fifth-grade girl on her way to school in
Valley of the Cross.</LD>
<LD>   There was something odd about this urgent young newcomer, many
passengers thought. He climbed aboard too fast. He didn't pay his
fare.</LD>
<TE>   "He looked like a terrorist," 15-year-old schoolboy Michael Lasri
said. "Like I thought a terrorist should look."</TE>
<TE>   But it was a moment too quick for thought. Tugged by
instinct--later, in his hospital cot, he called it "God's
hand"--Lasri lunged for the floor beneath his seat and blacked out.</TE>
<TE>   The boom of the explosion echoed for blocks around.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything flew," said Shlomi Kalderon, a tow-truck driver who
was idling behind the No. 32 at a jammed intersection.</TE>
<TE>   At least 19 people besides the bomber died. Come nightfall, scores
lay wounded in Jerusalem's hospitals. In more than 20 gory months of
intifada, months that have left cafes empty and children jumpy, that
have strewn carnage and paranoia in the rough streets of this ancient
limestone city--in all that time, this was the deadliest attack to
strike Jerusalem. It was, in fact, the deadliest in six years.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of this city have slipped in and out of war for decades,
have taken turns on both ends of brutal siege, have split and
revolted and conquered and lost. Now fear tinges the shaded streets
again. It is of the incessant, escalating attacks by Palestinian
militants.</TE>
<TE>   On their side, militant groups say that Israel will not--and
should not--live peacefully so long as it occupies Palestinian
territory. For months, Palestinian cities and towns have suffered
raids and sieges by Israeli soldiers, tanks and helicopters. The
Palestinians have seen their homes bulldozed, their infrastructure
destroyed and their neighbors shot for breaking curfew. Simple trips
to work or to visit family have become arduous, even impossible, amid
roadblocks, curfews and raids.</TE>
<TE>   "How beautiful it is to kill and to be killed," read a suicide
note from Ghoul, an earnest student of Islam apparently associated
with the militant Islamic group Hamas. "Not to love death, but to
struggle for life, to kill and be killed for the lives of the coming
generation."</TE>
<TE>   When Ghoul set off his bomb, Kalderon's windshield shattered. He'd
just dropped his daughters off at nursery school. He tripped from the
cab of his truck and stumbled agape toward the wreckage.</TE>
<TE>   "But the sights at my feet were too horrific," he said later. "I
had to step back and calm down. It was huge. People were lying with
their eyes open."</TE>
<TE>   On a crossroads slicked with blood, rush hour stood still. Bits of
flesh, broken glass and twisted metal had been flung in a wide
circle. Inside the blasted bus, corpses sat dead in their seats.
Hysteria set in.</TE>
<TE>   "Where's my sister?" a woman screamed at rescue workers.</TE>
<TE>   "You see? You see? You see?" a Jewish schoolboy in an oxford shirt
and skullcap screamed at foreign journalists. He stumbled and kept
yelling. "You see?"</TE>
<TE>   When Lasri blinked back into consciousness, there was nothing
overhead but a deep blue sky. The roof of the bus had been peeled and
curled back like the lid of a sardine can. He looked around. Limbs,
bones and purses cluttered the street. It's like television, he
thought. He couldn't move.</TE>
<TE>   Lasri attends a technical high school. On Tuesday, he overslept,
then raced to catch his bus. He planned to spend the day tinkering
with a remote control car for a science fair. Instead, somebody
dragged him from the wreckage and drove him to the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to kill us, don't you see?" he said, running a hand
over his scabbed forehead. Beside him, his mother nodded gently.</TE>
<TE>   It was a few hours after the attack, and social workers wove among
the cots and gurneys of the hospital, bringing bad news to the
injured. Across the way, they were telling a wounded young boy that
his older sister had died in the attack. Soon they would come to
Michael and tell him that his friend had been killed. His parents and
uncle already knew. "It's not a question of land," the boy said.
"They want to see us dead."</TE>
<TE>   The day dragged on. Soldiers set up roadblocks all over town, and
traffic wheezed along under the baking sun. Arik Feldman, managing
director of the Egged bus company, asked Prime Minister Ariel Sharon
to recruit 3,000 unemployed Israelis to work as security guards on
buses.</TE>
<TE>   Reports of danger pulsed on the radio and television. As many as
four suicide bombers are about to strike at Jerusalem, intelligence
sources warned local broadcasters. By the time evening prayers rang
from the mosques in East Jerusalem, the streets were all but empty.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like beads in a chain," said Karmit Rintzler, who stood
weeping softly on the fringes of 21-year-old Shiri Najari's funeral.
"This is my second friend to lose a child."</TE>
<TE>   As the sun sank lower and blue light smudged the hills outside
Jerusalem, families came to bury the bones of their dead. The
funerals were neither fancy nor long. The mourners came in Orthodox
black and frayed blue jeans. They gathered in a parking lot at the
edge of a sprawling hillside graveyard west of Jerusalem. They stood
with crossed arms and trembling chins to hear the Psalms, the prayers
and the bitter lamentations.</TE>
<TE>   "Our neighbors do not know what peace is," said Rabbi Mordechai
Najari, a relative of the dead young woman.</TE>
<TE>   Shiri Najari's remains rode to the graveyard in the back of a van,
wrapped in a shawl, arranged on a scarred stretcher. At the sight of
the bundle a hush fell, then a thin cry rose from the women.</TE>
<TE>   The men and women cried into the necks of their neighbors, or bent
over the hoods of cars to weep. They rocked over their prayer books.</TE>
<TE>   "Know where you came from and know where you're going," they sang.
"And before whom you shall be held accountable."</TE>
<TE>   Najari would have turned 22 next month. After finishing her army
service, she had traveled alone for a year in South America. She
wrote to her family that the world was beautiful after all.</TE>
<TE>   "Stay there," they urged her. "There's nothing for you here, and
it's dangerous." But she missed them too much to stay away. She flew
home and applied to medical school.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at me one last moment," said her sister, Shelley, who spoke
to the crowd in her dead sister's sunglasses. "And see that behind
your glasses, I am crying."</TE>
<TE>   The men lost their footing and clutched their hats as they
clambered through the graveyard with the stretcher on their
shoulders. The marble tombs of Gival Shaul are packed so tight that
there's scarcely room to walk between the stones. This is the first
glimpse of Jerusalem that greets travelers on the road from Tel Aviv:
dizzying sweeps of bleached graves climbing the hills.</TE>
<TE>   At the rear of the Najari funeral, a second procession of mourners
paced past carrying the body of 51-year-old Rahamim Zidkiyahu, who
was at the wheel of the No. 32. The two funerals blurred for a
moment, then split on separate rocky paths.</TE>
<TE>   When the bodies were buried, the mourners paused at the cemetery
gate and washed their hands three times to remove the dust of death.
Then these people of Jerusalem made their way home as darkness came
over the hills.</TE>

<HD>Israel Vows to Seize Arafat's Territories</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israel said it will seize Palestinian-controlled territory and stay
there until terrorism stops, in a policy about-face announced early
this morning after a deadly suicide bombing in Jerusalem.</LD>
<LD>   The Tuesday blast tore apart a bus, killing the attacker and 19
other people on board, and wounding more than 50.</LD>
<LD>   Israel's decision came as the region awaits the expected unveiling
of President Bush's vision for resolving the Middle East conflict.
Israel's move is likely to greatly complicate Bush's efforts to stop
the bloodshed and bring Israelis and Palestinians back to
negotiations.</LD>
<TE>   Through nearly two years of fighting, Israel has clung to the
principle that it did not want to indefinitely reoccupy Palestinian
population centers handed over under the 1993 Oslo peace accords. But
government sources confirmed early today that the Cabinet has now
abandoned that principle.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, the government said Israel will respond to
Tuesday's bombing by "capturing Palestinian Authority territory" and
that "these areas will be held by Israel as long as terror
continues."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli troops and tanks moved into the northern West Bank city of
Jenin before the statement was issued, and later also entered Nablus.
The army cut Jenin off from the refugee camp on its outskirts and
moved inside the camp, according to Palestinian witnesses. An army
spokesman said that "there's an operation in Jenin against the
terrorist infrastructure in the city." There were no immediate
reports of casualties.</TE>
<TE>   Early today, an army spokesman said that troops were deployed
inside Jenin and that the city was under a curfew. He said troops had
withdrawn from Nablus. But a government source, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said the army would seize "a Palestinian area within
hours, and it's for keeps now. We're not going to leave." He refused
to say which area would be targeted.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, the White House had no immediate comment on the
Israeli announcement. It was unclear what effect it might have on the
administration's peace proposal. But earlier Tuesday, White House
officials condemned the attack in Jerusalem and insisted that it
would not affect either the timing or the content of Bush's
announcement of his plan.</TE>
<TE>   "The president condemns this act of terror in the strongest
possible terms," said White House spokesman Scott McClellan. "These
terrorists who kill innocent men, women and children are enemies of
peace."</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli decision to step up its military actions came after a
day of consultations between Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, his
security chiefs and senior Cabinet ministers.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon started the morning Tuesday with a rare appearance at the
site of a terrorist attack, rushing to the scene shortly after a
22-year-old student from An Najah University in the West Bank
detonated a bomb packed with ball bearings and nails in the No. 32
bus.</TE>
<TE>   Surveying the carnage of Jerusalem's deadliest such attack in six
years, Sharon heaped scorn on Bush's anticipated call for the
establishment of a provisional Palestinian state in areas of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip now controlled by the Palestinian Authority.</TE>
<TE>   "The horrible pictures we saw here today of these murderous acts
by the Palestinians are stronger than any words," said a grim-faced
Sharon, standing near a row of corpses covered with black plastic
sheeting. "It is interesting [to speculate about] what kind of
Palestinian state they intend to create. What are they talking about?
This terrible thing ... is a continuation of the Palestinian terror
which we will fight against."</TE>
<TE>   The radical Islamic group Hamas claimed responsibility for the
bombing in a statement and promised more attacks to come.</TE>
<TE>   "We tell all Zionists to prepare their coffins and graves because
their dead will be in the hundreds," the statement said.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, condemned the bombing, but
Israel nonetheless blamed its president, Yasser Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials immediately said there would be a series of
military responses. Tanks and troops have been deployed on the
outskirts of Palestinian towns for weeks and routinely enter them to
hunt down militants.</TE>
<TE>   Late Tuesday, Palestinians reported that dozens of Israeli tanks
and an armored bulldozer were rumbling into Jenin. Palestinians said
that the tanks shot toward Jenin's refugee camp and that militants
fired back. A pair of Israeli helicopters hovered over Jenin, a
stronghold of Islamic militancy.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate action, just hours after the bus was bombed, Israeli
troops shot dead Muhmad Basharat, a militant with Islamic Jihad, at a
roadblock near the West Bank city of Hebron. The army said he was
shot when he reached for a gun during an identity check.</TE>
<TE>   In the West Bank city of Ramallah, where Arafat has his
headquarters, shopkeepers closed their stores early and residents
hoarded food in anticipation of an Israeli incursion.</TE>
<TE>   Yasser Abed-Rabbo, the Palestinian minister of culture and
information, predicted gloomily that the bus attack would "serve
Israel as a pretext to step up its aggression" on the Palestinian
Authority. Palestinian Labor Minister Ghassan Khatib blamed the
attacks on "the absence of a political initiative and the
procrastination of the United States and the international
community."</TE>
<TE>   Among the Israelis killed in Tuesday's attack were teenagers and
children on their way to school, who died along with the Palestinian
bomber from Faraa refugee camp, near Nablus. Dozens of office
workers, retirees and others were wounded in the blast, which reduced
the red and white bus to a charred skeleton.</TE>
<TE>   Police said that at least 14 of the dead lived in Gilo, a Jewish
neighborhood on the southern outskirts of Jerusalem, built on land
Israel annexed after the 1967 Middle East War. Since the current
fighting between Israelis and Palestinians erupted in September 2000,
Gilo has been fired on frequently by Palestinian gunmen in
neighboring Beit Jala and Bethlehem, in the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   The bus was traveling from Gilo to Jerusalem's central bus station
and had just made a stop in the Palestinian village of Beit Safafa,
in Jerusalem, when it exploded near the Patt junction.</TE>
<TE>   Cutting short an official visit to Bulgaria and Slovenia, Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres rushed back to join the government debate on a
response. Before his departure, Peres told reporters that the focus
should be on a political horizon rather than a military front. But
others in the Cabinet called for Arafat's expulsion from the
Palestinian territories and for Israel to topple the Palestinian
Authority.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to make sure that Yasser Arafat will not be able any
longer to control and to be the head of the Palestinians," said
Minister of Education Limor Livnat. "We will need to make sure that
Arafat personally will not be any longer in this area, because he is
the sponsor of terror attacks."</TE>
<TE>   Effi Eitam, a minister without portfolio and head of the National
Religious Party who has been criticized by Labor ministers as a
right-wing extremist, said: "There's not much disagreement at a time
when all of Israel has become a front for unprecedented terror. There
is no place for illusion, no virtual solutions. It is time to act.</TE>
<TE>   "There are moments in the life of a people," Eitam added, "when
things are very simple. We must fight for our home. It is either us
or them."</TE>
<TE>   Israel launched a massive military sweep across the West Bank in
March, after a suicide bomber blew himself up and killed 29 Israelis
in the Park Hotel in the coastal city of Netanya, where families had
gathered to celebrate the Jewish holiday of Passover.</TE>
<TE>   The incursion, called Operation Defensive Shield, was declared a
success when it ended in May. At the time, the army said it had
broken the back of the "terrorist infrastructure" in the West Bank.
But the pace of attacks inside Israel has quickened in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Israel began building a security fence between it and
the West Bank that is intended to help shield communities inside the
pre-1967 border from suicide attacks. The fence is expected to take
up to a year to complete.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon advisor Zalman Shoval said Tuesday that the attacks that
have already occurred have virtually destroyed the Israeli public's
desire to resume negotiations with the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "More and more, Israelis are saying to themselves: If this is what
the Palestinians do, and if this is what the present Palestinian
leadership supports or at least does nothing to stop, then the whole
idea of living in peace alongside such a Palestinian entity sounds
more like living in the realm of fantasy and not reality," said
Shoval, a former Israeli ambassador to Washington.</TE>
<TE>   For parents who had sent their children to school Tuesday, the
morning was one of horror.</TE>
<TE>   After the blast, frantic parents rushed to the scene, raced to
hospitals and, in the saddest cases, headed for Abu Kabir, the
national forensic laboratory. Doctors there said that bodies were so
badly mangled, it was difficult to identify them. Dozens of people
were hospitalized, some with serious injuries. Such attacks "always
come at a crucial time ... for people that are genuinely interested
in resuming a political process," said Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert.</TE>
<TE>   Olmert said Israel has "enormous respect" for Bush and his fight
against terrorism. "But I'm afraid his speech will not be practical
and will not bear any immediate consequences because as along as
Yasser Arafat is here, there will be no change. Arafat is terror.
Arafat is blood."</TE>
<TE>   Ehud Yaari, an analyst for Israel Television's Second Channel,
said Tuesday night that the security services intended to begin
expelling Palestinian leaders, possibly including Marwan Barghouti,
the West Bank leader of the Tanzim militia, who was arrested in April
by Israeli troops in Ramallah.</TE>

report.</TE>

<HD>China Is Passing Pollution to a New Generation, Study Finds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SHENZHEN, China</DL>
<LD>Paying for the environmental sins of their parents' generation,
nearly two-thirds of the children in this southern Chinese boomtown
suffer from lead poisoning, a recent study has shown.</LD>
<LD>   The survey of more than 11,000 local schoolchildren--one of the
largest of its kind in China--adds to the mounting evidence of the
toll that pollution is taking on the world's most populous country,
even as officials in Shenzhen spend millions of dollars promoting the
city as an environmental model.</LD>
<LD>   After 20 years of breakneck development, China has become a land
of major ecological damage, a nation where millions of residents gasp
for breath, where rivers flow with harmful chemicals and where green
spaces are shrinking at an alarming rate.</LD>
<TE>   Rapid industrialization and market reforms have pulled hundreds of
millions of Chinese out of abject poverty. But they have also given
rise to one of the most polluted nations in the history of the
planet.</TE>
<TE>   The long-term effects of such pollution are now coming into focus.
The study in Shenzhen demonstrates how the nation's children are
often most at risk and how the negative consequences of dirty air and
water extend beyond the present generation to the next.</TE>
<TE>   From October to December last year, researchers with the Shenzhen
branch of the Chinese Medical Assn. conducted lead tests on 11,348
local children.</TE>
<TE>   They discovered that 65% of the youngsters had concentrations of
lead in their systems that exceeded the level considered safe by the
World Health Organization.</TE>
<TE>   Left unchecked, lead poisoning can damage a person's nervous and
reproductive systems, and cause anemia and high blood pressure.</TE>
<TE>   In children, the effects can be worse, including irreversible
brain damage, mental retardation, behavioral problems and stunted
growth. Anecdotal evidence suggests that such problems are on the
rise among Chinese youth, although there are no hard data yet.
Extremely severe cases of lead poisoning can result in convulsions,
coma or death.</TE>
<TE>   Children are particularly susceptible to lead poisoning because of
their height: Lead is more heavily concentrated in the air near the
ground. They also breathe in high amounts of car exhaust. And they
are more likely to put objects tainted with lead in their mouths.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy for it to accumulate and develop into lead poisoning,"
said Wu Yulin, one of the directors of the Shenzhen study. "And
because it's a slow process, it's hard for people to detect right
away."</TE>
<TE>   The cumulative effect was apparent in Wu's study, which showed
that the older the children, who ranged in age from 3 to 15, the more
lead in their bodies.</TE>
<TE>   The results of his survey follow similarly grim findings in recent
years in cities around China.</TE>
<TE>   In Beijing, experts found excessive lead levels in about 20% of
the city's youngsters last year. An earlier study in Taiyuan, the
gritty, industrial capital of central Shanxi province, uncovered a
lead-poisoning rate of 64%.</TE>
<TE>   And in Guangzhou, one of Shenzhen's fellow cities in Guangdong
province--China's richest, most developed region--a survey two years
ago indicated that up to 83% of youngsters were suffering from
excessive lead.</TE>
<TE>   Extrapolating from various studies, experts estimate that lead
poisoning could afflict half of all urban Chinese youth, the official
Life Times newspaper reported Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Alarmed by the gathering weight of evidence, the Chinese
government is embarking on an investigation of 8 million to 10
million children nationwide to determine the extent of the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "The government needs to stress ... prevention of lead poisoning
as soon as possible," Wu said.</TE>
<TE>   The World Bank has identified lead poisoning as the No. 1
environmental disease among children in the developing world. But the
problem isn't confined to poor nations. In the late 1970s, nearly 90%
of American children had elevated lead levels in their blood. That
has dropped to less than 5% in the last decade, according to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The dramatic reduction in
the U.S. was attributed in large part to the switch to unleaded
gasoline.</TE>
<TE>   In China's rapidly developing cities, exhaust fumes remain one of
the biggest sources of lead in the air. The country has been phasing
in unleaded gas over the past five years, but in spotty fashion: In
Beijing, 30% of the gas used is estimated to fall short of the
government's environmental standards.</TE>
<TE>   Shenzhen is home to more than half a million automobiles, up from
practically zero two decades ago. Anointed by the late leader Deng
Xiaoping as one of China's "special economic zones," Shenzhen has
exploded from a sleepy fishing village of 30,000 people into a
bustling metropolis of 3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Its environment has suffered in the process.</TE>
<TE>   Power plants and textile factories in some parts of the city sully
the air, belching out toxic fumes from their smokestacks. Sewage,
dyes and other chemicals get dumped directly into the Pearl River
estuary.</TE>
<TE>   Yet at the same time, China nominated Shenzhen this year to the
U.N. Environmental Program's Global 500 Roll of Honor, a showcase of
the world's 500 most environmentally progressive cities.</TE>
<TE>   It was accepted. The UNEP said that Shenzhen had made great
strides in cleaning up its act; it congratulated the city government
on vetoing 3,619 projects that failed to meet environmental
requirements and on investing $461 million in protection measures.</TE>
<TE>   Zhang Xiaobin, publicity director of the Shenzhen Environmental
Protection Bureau, acknowledged that his city is not perfect. But he
insisted that Shenzhen had distinguished itself as a model for
others.</TE>
<TE>   "When you judge the environment of a place," he said, "you should
look at the overall situation."</TE>

<HD>Karzai Asks  Council for More Time</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>KABUL, Afghanistan -- This country's arduous formation of a new
government was prolonged Tuesday until at least today as
President-elect Hamid Karzai asked the delegates to a grand council
for more time to complete the crucial job of forming his Cabinet.</LD>
<LD>   Karzai backed away, however, from the position he took just a day
earlier that there was no need to have the council approve the
appointments.</LD>
<LD>   The shift came after Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. envoy to
Afghanistan, said that under an agreement reached last year in
Germany that set up the steps for creating a government, approval
from the loya jirga is necessary.</LD>
<TE>   "Based on the Bonn agreement, both the structure of the government
and key personnel have to be proposed by the president and approved
by the loya jirga," he said. "Whoever says approval is not needed has
spoken mistakenly. As the international community, we were involved
in it, and we will insist on it."</TE>
<TE>   Still up in the air late Tuesday was what form that approval might
take, said Karzai's senior advisor, Ashref Ghani. Among the options
were a voice vote, a show of hands or a ballot. Such nitty-gritty
procedural questions have come up several times a day at the grand
council as it attempts to create a government almost from scratch.</TE>
<TE>   But the nearly 1,600 delegates took the delay in stride,
applauding and laughing as Karzai made light of the difficulty of
choosing a Cabinet but also struck a sober note by reminding them
that the right choice will be critical to Afghanistan's future.</TE>
<TE>   "The selection of the Cabinet, it is almost over, but I think more
consultation is better because it concerns the nation's destiny,"
Karzai said. He joked that his life would have been far easier if the
Bonn agreement had determined the Cabinet members rather than leaving
the task up to him.</TE>
<TE>   The choice of a Cabinet will be a key test of Karzai's ability to
juggle the needs and desires of the different ethnic groups that make
up Afghanistan. The most powerful posts in his interim administration
have been held by ethnic Tajiks, while Pushtuns--who claim that they
are at least as numerous--have complained of being shortchanged.
However, if Karzai alienates the still heavily armed, Tajik-dominated
Northern Alliance commanders, he risks an almost immediate challenge
to his authority.</TE>
<TE>   During the loya jirga, which officially opened June 11, there have
been scattered reports of attacks and violence around the country,
serving as a stark reminder of the limits of Karzai's power and that
of the international community. The most recent incident occurred
Tuesday night in Kabul, the capital, when two rocket blasts shook the
eastern suburbs. No casualties were reported.</TE>
<TE>   International peacekeepers had warned of violence during the loya
jirga, perhaps from fugitive members of the deposed Taliban regime or
the Al Qaeda terrorist network, or from others seeking to destabilize
the situation here.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, it became clear that a blueprint proposed for
forming a national council, or shura, to help the new government
function was still controversial, and it appeared likely that
delegates will leave Kabul with the issue still undecided. Offered by
the grand council's chairman, Ismail Qasimyar, the plan would draw
representatives from each province and include others chosen from
among delegates to the loya jirga. This new group also would reserve
15 seats for women, Qasimyar said.</TE>
<TE>   However, a raucous debate broke out after he described his plan.
The controversy gave Karzai a chance to tout his proposal to have a
handful of delegates from each election district stay in Kabul after
the loya jirga ends to refine the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   At its heart, the disagreement involves whether to have a
legislative body that would act as a check on the executive branch
and could write new laws, or to have an advisory council that would
have less power but could be organized more quickly. A legislative
body would probably take the shape of a parliament, and that would
require an election--a lengthy and expensive process.</TE>

<HD>South African Whites Say Deck Is Stacked Against Them</HD>
<DH>Workplace: Many non- blacks complain they are unfairly
penalized by affirmative action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAPE TOWN, South Africa</DL>
<LD>When the Greater Cape Town morgue started looking for a new
superintendent in 2000, police Capt. Ricardo Schouten was convinced
he would get the job. A medically trained cop skilled in autopsies,
he had already been the acting superintendent for three years.</LD>
<LD>   Furthermore, his experience and police service grade placed him
first on a list of potential candidates, the local police union
confirmed.</LD>
<LD>   But Schouten, who is white, was passed over. The position was
awarded to a less qualified candidate of mixed race, union bosses
acknowledged.</LD>
<TE>   Schouten felt betrayed.</TE>
<TE>   "There was not even a call to say, 'Thanks for the past three
years,' " said Schouten, who believes he was denied the promotion on
racial grounds.</TE>
<TE>   When the government labor court referred him first to the national
arbitration commission, Schouten decided to drop the case. He was
subsequently assigned to investigate illegal pornography outlets and
secondhand shops.</TE>
<TE>   As South Africa grapples to redress the legacy of inequality and
prejudice against the country's black majority, many South Africans
feel that they are being unfairly penalized.</TE>
<TE>   The affirmative action policies, they charge, have resulted in
reverse discrimination against the country's white and other nonblack
minorities.</TE>
<TE>   "What has happened here is that an image has been created of a new
power system," said Lawrence Schlemmer, the Cape Town-based vice
president of the South African Institute of Race Relations. "The
image is that in all spheres there is a greater tendency to provide
greater opportunity to the formerly disadvantaged, so that the
minority is now at a disadvantage."</TE>
<TE>   Critics also argue that affirmative action policies are causing
increased racial tension that threatens to derail any progress made
toward racial harmony in the eight years since apartheid was
demolished.</TE>
<TE>   "The emphasis is by far no longer on reconciliation. The central
concept is now transformation," said Koos Malan, an executive member
of the Group of 63, a movement of Afrikaner intellectuals.
Afrikaners, descendants of 17th century Dutch settlers to southern
Africa, represent one of the country's minority groups. The
then-ruling Afrikaner National Party instituted apartheid in 1948.</TE>
<TE>   But government officials defend the transformation as being key to
South Africa's development as a democracy, and they praise
legislation that has been introduced to level the racial playing
field and counter discrimination in all areas of society.</TE>
<TE>   Under the former system of apartheid, blacks, who make up 77% of
the country's population of 43 million, were relegated to menial and
labor-intensive jobs, subjected to legalized racial oppression and
denied citizenship. Indians and so-called "coloreds," or people of
mixed race, were placed on a higher rung than blacks but were still
considered inferior to whites, who make up about 10.5% of the
population.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the Employment Equity Act of 1998 seeks to achieve racial
equity in the workplace by demanding that all employers with 50 or
more workers undertake measures to promote equal opportunity for
people from previously disadvantaged communities.</TE>
<TE>   Although there is no officially required quota for such staff, the
legislation endorses preferential treatment and numerical goals to
ensure equitable representation.</TE>
<TE>   Frans Moatshe, director of employment equity at the Labor
Department, said government inspectors regularly drop by companies
unannounced to monitor whether they are abiding by affirmative action
rules.</TE>
<TE>   The traditionally white-dominated fields of banking, mining and
insurance were prime targets of the government inspectors, Moatshe
said.</TE>
<TE>   Companies failing to comply with employment equity guidelines
after two written warnings face court action and a possible fine of
between $50,000 and $90,000, Moatshe said, adding that there is, in
general, a high level of compliance, partly enforced by the threat of
penalties.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't comply, the possibility of contracting state
services or contracts is low," Moatshe said.</TE>
<TE>   A recently revised Mineral and Petroleum Development Bill will
make black economic empowerment a compulsory requirement when
granting mining and prospecting permits to private companies.</TE>
<TE>   "Corporations in this country had an opportunity to institute
affirmative action the right way, and it is fair to say they failed
dismally," Danisa Baloyi, executive director of the National Black
Business Caucus, recently told the Sowetan newspaper. "Now they must
be made to change."</TE>
<TE>   Detractors, however, charge that black empowerment policies have
been a useful tool for the ruling elite to appoint unskilled and
inexperienced government cronies in the public and private sector,
which they argue could have dire consequences for the economy.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a feeling, certainly among minorities, that standards
have dropped," said Schlemmer, the race relations analyst. "It's not
only [in terms of] qualifications. It's also experience. A large
number of new decision-makers in the public sector have no experience
whatsoever, and they are young."</TE>
<TE>   Critics also insist that compulsory black empowerment has resulted
in a brain drain, because white men in particular are leaving
companies--often for opportunities overseas--when they realize that
they stand little, or no, chance of promotion. Billy Daniels,
regional secretary for the South African Police Union in Western
Cape, said the practice of excluding whites from promotions could
harm working relations within the police service, and that trying to
exclusively promote nonwhite officers fosters a false sense of
entitlement.</TE>
<TE>   "[The police management] has never bothered to allay white fears,"
Daniels said. "And they've never said to the black employee that we
can't all become commissioner. A lot of black officers out there have
the attitude that I 'must' be the next commissioner."</TE>
<TE>   In reality, nonwhites still trail behind whites in the police
service hierarchy, as in other fields.</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Department reported last fall that in more than 8,000
workplaces across all sectors of the economy, blacks held 27.3% of
the  jobs at all levels of management and professional employment.</TE>
<TE>   Although many view the figures as a significant step forward,
government statistics also showed that representation of blacks at
the top management level was 85% lower than black representation in
"unskilled and defined decision-making" positions.</TE>
<TE>   Controversy over equal racial representation has touched most
areas of South African life.</TE>
<TE>   The debate exploded in the sporting arena earlier this year when
the president of the country's cricket board ordered selectors of the
national cricket team, which was scheduled to tour Australia, to
replace a white player with one of mixed race.</TE>
<TE>   The move got the full backing of Sports Minister Ngconde Balfour,
who argued that the pace of ensuring equal racial representation in
sports had to be speeded up.</TE>
<TE>   "In the so-called 'excellence versus transformation' debate, those
advocating 'merit selection' argue that patience and caution must be
exercised in bringing black sports people through into provincial and
national teams," Balfour told reporters at a February briefing in
Cape Town. "Young sports people are fast losing patience with such
arguments."</TE>
<TE>   The issue sparked a raging debate among South Africans across the
racial divide, with many blacks insisting that they were as good, if
not better, at cricket than whites, and whites arguing that the
longtime exclusion of nonwhites from professional cricket meant they
couldn't possibly be up to scratch yet.</TE>
<TE>   "Whites have been playing cricket in this country for 100 years,"
wrote Chris Oelschig, who identified himself as a white accountant in
a letter to the national Star newspaper. "What is the point of
putting players in the team to play against the best in the world
when they are nowhere near ready?"</TE>
<TE>   Another reader, M. Petersen, argued in a letter to the daily
Citizen that the government's sports policy underscored the general
"anti-white" stance of South African President Thabo Mbeki.</TE>
<TE>   "He is bent on having only blacks in every conceivable key
position in South African society," said Petersen, who refused to
give a first name. "Deep down in his heart, he resents whites and
will do all in his power to make whites feel ill at ease in the land
of their birth or adoption."</TE>
<TE>   Schlemmer said the frustration expressed by the country's minority
groups is no surprise.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a feeling that in all spheres, they are battling against
odds," Schlemmer said. "They are not actually suffering, but they are
having to make additional effort."</TE>
<TE>   Malan, the Group of 63 member, said an increasing feeling of
isolation had led thousands of Afrikaners to emigrate since 1994 and
caused others to insulate themselves within society.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, a survey conducted by Schlemmer found that Afrikaners
were more likely than any other group to identify race
discrimination, and specifically affirmative action policies, as the
key issue holding them back in life.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is, the pendulum has swung from one extreme to the
other," Malan said. "And that is why you find increasing alienation
among Afrikaners these days."</TE>
<TE>   For the beneficiaries of the country's equity policies, however,
the policy has largely been rewarding, and many employers say it has
transformed the South African workplace for the better.</TE>
<TE>   "You get a group of people working together from various
backgrounds, so you get to know their culture, and it is very
enriching," said Hymie Swanepoel, a partner at the Cape Town-based
accounting firm of Moores Rowland, which pursues an aggressive policy
of affirmative action. As of the end of April, 80 of 181 staff
members were people of color.</TE>
<TE>   Armed only with a high school diploma, Marco Abrahams joined
Moores Rowland as a filing clerk in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   He has since been promoted to the position of a tax administrator,
thanks to the firm's equity policy, which boasts a training program
for formerly underprivileged groups.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's something very special that previously disadvantaged
people can actually get a chance to succeed," said Abrahams, 26, who
is of mixed race. "I actually had a lucky break."</TE>

<HD>Saudis Say They Have Broken Up an Al Qaeda Cell</HD>
<DH>Terror: The government reports that seven men are being
held on suspicion of planning attacks. Six others are suspected of
aiding them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>Saudi Arabia broke up an Al Qaeda terrorist cell that was planning to
use explosives and surface-to-air missiles to attack "vital targets"
in the desert kingdom, including U.S. warplanes and military
personnel, the Saudi government said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement was the latest in a string of events, stretching
from Morocco to Pakistan to the United States, suggesting that
although Al Qaeda's refuge in Afghanistan has been destroyed, the
appetite and ability of its sympathizers to plan--and in some cases
carry out--terrorist acts remain intact.</LD>
<LD>   Saudi security forces were said to be holding seven suspected
terrorists--six Saudi citizens and one Sudanese national--charged
with smuggling SA-7 surface-to-air missiles into the country.
Authorities said that the suspected terrorists tried to fire one
rocket near the Prince Sultan Air Base south of the capital, Riyadh,
and that they hid another in the desert sands nearby. The U.S. has
about 4,500 personnel stationed at the base.</LD>
<TE>   Six other men were arrested on suspicion of helping the Sudanese
man slip out of Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   The first group was planning to "carry out terrorist attacks aimed
at vital installations," according to a statement written by the
Interior Ministry and distributed by the official Saudi Press Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, the information released by the Saudi government was
sketchy. But the announcement marked a watershed for the kingdom--the
first time since Sept. 11 that Saudi Arabia has not only arrested
some of its own citizens on terrorist charges but declared that they
were working with Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, the country initially felt
that its faith-based system was unfairly tarred because 15 of the 19
hijackers were Saudi nationals.</TE>
<TE>   In the statement Tuesday, the government said the men arrested in
Saudi Arabia "are being questioned about their terrorist acts, which
go against Islamic principles."</TE>
<TE>   "It is not surprising that the war with Afghanistan has started
this whole new [terrorist] movement," said Diaa Rashwan, a researcher
with the Cairo-based Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic
Studies. "There is going to be a lot of youth now coming up, being
active in the name of Islamic jihad."</TE>
<TE>   Alleged Al Qaeda cases have surfaced in many places around the
globe. In the first post-Sept. 11 attack linked to the terrorist
network, a bomb-laden truck crashed into a centuries-old synagogue on
Djerba, a small Tunisian island off the coast of North Africa,
killing 21 people.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Morocco announced the arrest of three Saudis allegedly
commanded by Al Qaeda operatives in Afghanistan to blow up U.S. and
British ships in the Strait of Gibraltar.</TE>
<TE>   Washington recently accused an American citizen, Jose Padilla, of
helping devise a plot to detonate a radioactive bomb in the U.S. And
Friday, a car bomb exploded outside the U.S. Consulate in Karachi,
Pakistan, killing 12 people.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the successful attacks prove that Al Qaeda is still a
major threat--or the arrests prove that it has been weakened as a
terrorist force--is a matter of interpretation.</TE>
<TE>   "Al Qaeda was never fully destroyed in the bombing of
Afghanistan," said Hala Moustafa, an Egyptian researcher and expert
on Islamic militant groups. "It is expected that Al Qaeda members are
becoming active all over the world and especially in Arab countries."</TE>
<TE>   But Khaled Maeena, editor in chief of the Arab News, based in the
Saudi port city of Jidda, said the arrests demonstrate that Al Qaeda
is now "a toothless tiger."</TE>
<TE>   "Al Qaeda has been fragmented," he said. "It is important that
people should know, once the top leadership is in shambles, the foot
soldiers will not amount to much."</TE>
<TE>   But there is also a sense among some observers that a number of
the recent arrests, particularly of the so-called dirty bomber in the
U.S., have at best been overblown attempts to win public support and
divert attention from criticism of Western security organizations.</TE>
<TE>   "With regards to these arrests," said Rashwan, "this is just an
explosion of stories to cover up earlier criticism."</TE>
<TE>   In the most recent case, Saudi authorities said they had been
following the terror suspects for many months. Suspicions heightened
in May when security guards found a spent missile launcher tube about
two miles from a runway at the desert base.</TE>
<TE>   The Saudi government said that among those arrested was a Sudanese
man suspected of being an Al Qaeda cell leader. The man allegedly had
slipped out of Saudi Arabia and back into Sudan with the help of five
Saudi men and one Iraqi.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged cell leader was picked up by Sudanese authorities and,
at Riyadh's request, was returned to Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   The Sudanese government announced Sunday that it had returned the
suspect to Saudi custody after the man admitted firing a missile at a
plane taking off from Prince Sultan Air Base.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, a U.S. official said a Sudanese man suspected of being
an Al Qaeda cell leader had acknowledged shooting a shoulder-fired
SA-7 missile at a U.S. plane taking off from the base.</TE>
<TE>   At a Pentagon briefing Tuesday, Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld said that to his knowledge, no important Al Qaeda leaders
have been among those arrested by the Saudis and other governments in
recent sweeps, but he added that some arrests have probably not been
disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   "There are countries arresting people, I am sure, that aren't even
being noted, and that is a continuing process," Rumsfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer John Hendren in Washington and Jailan Zayan of
The Times' Cairo Bureau contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Trial Opens in Austria Over Cable Car Blaze</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>VIENNA</DL>
<LD>VIENNA -- Sixteen people charged with negligence in Austria's
deadliest peacetime disaster went on trial Tuesday, with a prosecutor
saying that cable car operators, technicians and government officials
created a "mosaic of mistakes" that led to the deaths of 155 people
in a grisly ski resort fire.</LD>
<LD>   Eight of the victims in the Nov. 11, 2000, inferno in Kaprun,
about 50 miles from Salzburg, were Americans.</LD>
<LD>   "The fire was preventable," said Salzburg's public prosecutor, Eva
Danninger-Soriat.</LD>
<TE>   The operators, technicians and government officials bypassed
safety measures that could have saved the lives of the victims,
Danninger-Soriat was quoted by the Austria Press Agency as saying.</TE>
<TE>   The fire broke out as a crowded cable car carried skiers and
snowboarders up the Kitzsteinhorn glacier.</TE>
<TE>   Smoke poured from the rear of the car as it headed into a tunnel,
where it then stopped. The electric doors failed to open, trapping
the passengers.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve people escaped by using ski boots and poles to break
windows.</TE>
<TE>   The choking smoke was drawn up to the station at the top, killing
three people.</TE>
<TE>   The driver and sole passenger of another cable car heading
downhill also died.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators traced the disaster to a defective and illegally
installed space heater that caused hydraulic brake oil in nearby
pipes to overheat. The scalding oil dripped onto the cable car's
plastic-coated floor and set it afire, filling the cab with flames
and toxic smoke.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers for the 16 accused employees of Gletscherbahnen
Kaprun AG, its suppliers and inspectors said their clients had done
their jobs properly and that no one could have foreseen the danger.</TE>
<TE>   The defendants face prison sentences ranging from six months to
five years if convicted.</TE>

<HD>Hungary's Premier Faces Spy Allegation</HD>
<DH>Europe: Prime minister is accused of having worked in
Communist counter-espionage service. Foes warn of a possible
political crisis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY and PALMA MELIS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>BUDAPEST, Hungary</DL>
<LD>Prime Minister Peter Medgyessy was accused Tuesday of having secretly
served Communist Hungary's counter-espionage service, a charge that
triggered doubts about whether he can remain in office.</LD>
<LD>   An ex-Communist and former banker, Medgyessy denied any
wrongdoing, but not the allegation itself, which he acknowledged
could be politically damaging.</LD>
<LD>   The recently elected prime minister's failure to immediately issue
a clear denial to parliament triggered an opposition warning of a
potential constitutional crisis.</LD>
<TE>   "If I feel that the confidence [of the ruling parties] becomes
shaky toward me, then I will resign," Medgyessy said on television
Tuesday evening. "But as I feel their confidence now, I will continue
in my work."</TE>
<TE>   The right-leaning daily newspaper Magyar Nemzet splashed the
charge on its front page Tuesday, running a photocopy of a March 1978
document that promoted "Comrade D-209" to the rank of first
lieutenant in the service aimed against foreign spies.</TE>
<TE>   The document did not directly identify the person receiving the
promotion, but his date of birth and mother's maiden name are the
same as Medgyessy's.</TE>
<TE>   Medgyessy, 59, who heads a center-left coalition that took office
only last month, dismissed the accusation as a political ploy.</TE>
<TE>   "The article is about trying to smear politicians to get people to
talk about topics of interest to a few instead of what really
interests the country," Medgyessy said.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Evasive</TE>
<TE>   But the prime minister implied in several ways that the charge
might be true. "Either I had a strictly confidential position--then I
protected Hungarian interests and then it is strictly confidential,
so I cannot answer--or the Magyar Nemzet article is not true," he
told parliament.</TE>
<TE>   The prime minister also referred his parliamentary critics to an
interview he gave last year that defended counterintelligence work.</TE>
<TE>   "There are situations in one's life when, in the interests of
national sovereignty, it's necessary to take steps which protect the
country's interests against foreign intelligence, be they [the
Soviet] KGB or Western ones," he said in those comments to the daily
Magyar Hirlap. At the time, it appeared that he was speaking in
general terms, not about himself.</TE>
<TE>   Medgyessy stressed Tuesday that in 1996, when he was finance
minister in a democratic government, an investigation determined that
he had not served the domestic secret police.</TE>
<TE>   "I was never an informer," Medgyessy said in parliament. "I did
not do anything in the past for which I should be ashamed."</TE>
<TE>   Several former Soviet bloc countries, including Hungary, have laws
that allow ex-Communists to participate fully in politics but require
screening of politicians to see whether they had participated in
domestic spying, which was part of the hated apparatus of
police-state control.</TE>
<TE>   Details of the laws and potential punishments vary, but their
essence is to make it difficult for former informers to hold office.</TE>
<TE>   Critics complain that the laws can destroy the careers of former
dissidents who at some point were pressured into giving up
information, while the high officials who ran the system go
unpunished.</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, say that within the region's Communist parties
were many high-level reformist figures who helped bring the system
down. Many of Medgyessy's supporters put him in this category.</TE>
<TE>   The Hungarian law requires that politicians and other public
figures be screened to determine whether they served the Communist
government as informers or had access to informers' reports. Those
found to belong to either category are secretly urged to resign.</TE>
<TE>   If they fail to do so, the investigative panel's report is made
public, but they are not required to leave office.</TE>
<TE>   In Medgyessy's case, the panel found that when he was deputy prime
minister of the last Communist government, he had access to
informers' reports, but it found no evidence that he had been an
informer. As required by the law, the panel urged Medgyessy to resign
his finance minister's post. He refused to do so and the report was
made public, but that did not prevent him from becoming prime
minister in May.</TE>
<TE>   The law says nothing about work for counterintelligence. But many
anti-Communist Hungarians view any kind of secret security work for
the former regime as unacceptable, partly because such behavior was
seen as collaboration with the Soviet Union, which brutally crushed a
1956 democratic revolution here.</TE>
<TE>   Zoltan Pokorni, leader in parliament of the main opposition
FiDeSz-Hungarian Civic Party, rebuked Medgyessy for evasiveness,
declaring: "If you do not clear it up, your personal moral crisis can
mean the most important constitutional crisis so far in the free
Republic of Hungary."</TE>
<TE>   Long Political History</TE>
<TE>   Medgyessy joined the Finance Ministry after graduating from
university in 1966.</TE>
<TE>   He was part of a team that secretly negotiated Hungary's joining
the International Monetary Fund in 1982, seen as a bold anti-Moscow
step at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Medgyessy served Hungary's former Communist government during its
waning years in the late 1980s as finance minister and deputy prime
minister, when he was among a group of reformers many credit with
turning the country into a democracy.</TE>
<TE>   He was finance minister again from 1996 to 1998 under a government
led by the Hungarian Socialist Party. The Socialists picked him as
their candidate for prime minister in April parliamentary elections
even though he has never joined the party.</TE>
<TE>   Socialist parliamentarians were meeting privately in emergency
session Tuesday evening.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Holley reported from Rome and correspondent
Melis from Budapest.</TE>

<HD>Japan OKs Arrest of Lawmaker</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Japan's parliament today approved the arrest of a powerful lawmaker
suspected of bribery in a scandal that has deeply embarrassed the
administration of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.</LD>
<LD>   The decision by parliament's lower house comes two days after
prosecutors sought permission to arrest Muneo Suzuki, who has been
accused of accepting bribes from a lumber company. His arrest was
expected sometime today.</LD>
<LD>   Because he had refused to give up his seat in the lower house,
Suzuki's arrest required the body's approval. A panel of ruling and
opposition leaders gave the OK.</LD>
<TE>   Suzuki, 54, who belonged to the largest and most powerful faction
in Koizumi's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, quit the party in March
after the corruption allegations surfaced.</TE>
<TE>   The latest scandal marks another major setback for Koizumi, who is
trying to convince an increasingly skeptical public that he is
delivering on promises of reforms, including ridding his party of
corruption.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Minister Mayumi Moriyama appeared before the panel to
explain why prosecutors want to make the arrest. Suzuki reportedly
denied the allegation to the panel.</TE>
<TE>   Tokyo prosecutors say Suzuki accepted 5 million yen ($40,000) from
lumber company Yamarin in 1998 in exchange for lobbying for leniency
in an illegal logging case.</TE>
<TE>   Suzuki gained notoriety early this year for helping orchestrate
the ouster of popular Foreign Minister Makiko Tanaka. He was later
summoned to testify in parliament to address allegations he profited
financially from his power over the Foreign Ministry.</TE>

<HD>Need for Speed Has Workers Seething</HD>
<DH>Labor: Production pace is emerging as a top health concern
for low-wage employees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A decade-long obsession with productivity has been healthy for the
corporate bottom line, but workers say they are paying for it with
exhaustion and pain.</LD>
<LD>   Job speedup is emerging as a top complaint for low-wage employees
in sectors as diverse as food processing and tourism. It has become a
pivotal bargaining issue in some union contracts. And increasingly,
health and safety experts consider it a source of injury and illness.</LD>
<LD>   The subject is crucial to many aging workers, who see a future in
which they would be unable to keep up the pace.</LD>
<TE>   In a Los Angeles pork-processing plant, workers once limited by
union contract to boning 60 hams an hour are up to 70 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Maids at a Las Vegas Strip resort have in five years gone from
cleaning 14 rooms to 17 rooms per shift.</TE>
<TE>   A frozen-food plant in Marshall, Mo., runs 1,200 chicken pot pies
an hour, compared with 1,100 two years ago and 800 in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Speedup takes its toll in many ways, such as a veteran food-
service employee being fired for failing to keep up with new
production quotas or a young immigrant's fatal slip of a knife on a
fast meat-cutting line. In small but growing numbers, many workers
are taking a stand and saying "no more."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, in one of the strongest responses yet, hotel
housekeepers in Las Vegas put job speed ahead of wages in contract
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   "In our industry, wages and benefits are perennially the No. 1 and
No. 2 issue. For workload to jump to the top of the table is really
something new," said Tom Snyder, a spokesman for the national hotel
workers union. "That tells me that companies are trying to squeeze
every last bit of energy out of their work force."</TE>
<TE>   Facing demanding shareholders and cutthroat national and
international competitors, business owners have been under tremendous
pressure to boost output per employee since at least the early 1990s,
economists said. The recent economic downturn only made matters
worse.</TE>
<TE>   "Profit margins got killed in the last recession, so corporations
are under a lot of pressure to raise profits," said Stan Shipley, a
senior economist at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. "How do you do that? You
can't raise prices; nobody has that power anymore. The only way is to
make your workers more productive."</TE>
<TE>   That need, he said, "unquestionably" leads to a faster work pace.</TE>
<TE>   But many workers argue that they already are operating at maximum
speed and have no reserves to fall back on.</TE>
<TE>   "Owners are going to have to realize these are not machines
cleaning their buildings. You can't just crank up the dial," said
David Huerta, senior organizer for the Service Employees
International Union Local 1877 in Los Angeles, which is fighting
attempts to make janitors clean downtown office buildings faster.</TE>
<TE>   "People have reached their max," he said. "Asking more of them now
would mean all-out war."</TE>
<TE>   Labor has a long history of fighting management over speed, going
back to assembly-line innovations of a century ago. At the height of
union power in the 1960s, most contracts, particularly in
manufacturing, contained language on workload and pace.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the vast majority of workers are not under union contract,
and even those who are may be vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   Just ask Christina Roman, a member of the Hotel Employees and
Restaurant Employees International Union when she was fired in
December from a job she had held for 24 years packing airline meals.
Weeks earlier, a supervisor warned her in writing to improve
"severely poor productivity."</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted us to do the work of five hours in three, and that is
not possible," said Roman, who lives in Hawthorne. Still unemployed
six months later, she seems bewildered by the shift that effectively
shut her out of the job market.</TE>
<TE>   "All those years, I did quality work," she said. "Now they just
want people who work fast."</TE>
<TE>   Roman worked for LSG Sky Chefs, a division of German airline
Lufthansa and the largest airline caterer in the world. Despite
healthy growth, the company advised investors last year that
industrywide consolidation was squeezing profit margins. The company
vowed in its 2001 annual report that it would respond by "improving
productivity [and] standardizing processes."</TE>
<TE>   About that time, Roman and several other workers said, strangers
toting clipboards and stopwatches appeared at the company's three Los
Angeles-area kitchens. They measured each movement, calculating the
minutes it took to load a cart or to set up a tray with napkins,
cookies, bread, butter and a salad.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of Sky Chefs declined to be interviewed but issued
a written response to questions. The company acknowledged that
workers were studied and timed and that rates were set for each task.</TE>
<TE>   "We use these average times as a tool to help us ensure that the
right number of employees are on duty at the right times," the
statement said, "not as a way to hold workers to a time quota."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, workers must now keep detailed logs and explain
whenever they fall below production guidelines. Several said they
were threatened with dismissal if they failed to keep up with the
scheduled pace.</TE>
<TE>   Jorge Gamboa, who sets up meal trays for American Airlines
flights, was warned in writing May 7 that his performance was "far
below company standards of 180 trays per hour."</TE>
<TE>   Gamboa, a 13-year Sky Chefs employee who works with a strained
elbow, said the rate is impossible to maintain.</TE>
<TE>   "It's OK to go this fast once in a while," he said, "but when you
do it every day, it damages you."</TE>
<TE>   Worker advocates say Sky Chefs is no exception. As evidence, they
point to the remarkable productivity gains of the last decade, which
continued through boom and recession.</TE>
<TE>   Economists note that those gains were driven largely by factors
such as increased computer use and more efficient work practices that
cut idle time.</TE>
<TE>   Although new technology and business practices have helped workers
become more efficient, they also have eroded their ability to control
the pace and volume of work.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the use of bar codes and scanners in warehouses cuts
the time workers spend searching for merchandise but also makes those
workers highly replaceable. Meat-cutting factories have significantly
boosted productivity but also reduced the need for skilled butchers.</TE>
<TE>   "Workers are now being called upon to be very flexible and do
whatever the employer wants," said Bill Dickens, an economist at the
Brookings Institution in Washington, "and that can include working
harder and faster."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike wages and benefits, though, the pace of work is difficult
to quantify or to compare across industries. So despite growing
interest, evidence of speedup remains largely anecdotal.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems soft and mushy, but what people are saying is
meaningful," said Bill Kojola, an industrial hygienist in the
AFL-CIO's Health and Safety Department. "At some point, there's no
more to squeeze."</TE>
<TE>   Many health and safety experts suspect that fast work pace is at
the root of an epidemic of musculoskeletal injuries, such as
tendinitis. And in a few severe cases, they say, speedup may have led
to death.</TE>
<TE>   In Nebraska, an immigrant worker at a meatpacking plant died two
years ago after slicing open his chest with a boning knife near the
end of his shift. The United Food and Commercial Workers
International Union, which represented the worker, said excessive
workload contributed to the death.</TE>
<TE>   The accident prompted a written warning from the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration to the employer, Excel Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "Added workload could cause the employee, working with sharp
instruments, to work at an accelerated rate, increasing the potential
for knife injury," the Oct. 4, 2000, OSHA letter said. "This practice
should be curtailed."</TE>
<TE>   In a paper released in May, the National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health identified speedup and other changes
in work organization as a priority for research.</TE>
<TE>   "To compete more effectively, many companies have restructured
themselves and downsized their work forces," the authors said. "The
revolutionary changes occurring in today's workplace have far
outpaced our understanding of their implications for work-life
quality and safety, and health on the job."</TE>
<TE>   Labor union veterans remember battles over production speeds going
back decades.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Rodriguez, an organizer with the United Food and Commercial
Workers, represented workers in Los Angeles meatpacking plants 30
years ago, when contracts contained strong protections.</TE>
<TE>   "We had the right to aggrieve workloads. We had the right to
conduct studies and adjust the speed if we had to," Rodriguez said.
"We won many an arbitration case that then set standards, like 60
hams an hour on a boning line."</TE>
<TE>   To settle a dispute at the Farmer John pork-processing plant in
Vernon, Rodriguez rigged a mechanical counter under a table, which a
worker could tap with his knee each time he boned a ham. The union
documented a speed of 67 hams an hour, seven more than management
claimed, and won the right to slow the line, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Many such hard-won gains were lost, however, as union jobs
disappeared and organized labor struggled to hang on to those that
were left. In that tough bargaining environment, unions generally
found it easier to concede control over work speed than accept cuts
in wages and benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the same line runs at 70 hams a minute, Rodriguez said.
Farmer John executives did not return calls for comment.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have the work- standard language [in the contract]
anymore--that was taken out long ago," Rodriguez said. "Even if we
did, I don't know if we could slow it down. The whole mentality of
this country is: 'Hey, that's featherbedding. You can't tell an
employer he can't go faster.' "</TE>
<TE>   But more and more these days, workers are trying to do just that.
The most notable case to date is that of the Las Vegas hotel
housekeepers, who by threatening to strike forced work speed to the
top of the bargaining agenda.</TE>
<TE>   The Culinary Workers Union, which is affiliated with the Hotel
Employees and Restaurant Employees, did its own statistical analysis
that showed an increase during the last 10 years in the number of
rooms cleaned per worker. The average size of rooms and number of
fixtures in them also grew, said D. Taylor, chief officer of the
union local.</TE>
<TE>   The union also commissioned a study of housekeeper health by UC
San Francisco occupational epidemiologist Niklas Krause, who found
high levels of stress, pain and unreported injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Housekeepers, most of whom are immigrants, often worked through
lunch and breaks and declined to drink water to reduce trips to the
bathroom, he said. More than 80% said they regularly took pain
medication to get through a shift.</TE>
<TE>   "They think we're made of stone, that we're made of wood," said
Maria Bruce, who works for the Mirage in Las Vegas. "But they don't
know that we ache all over. Our whole bodies ache all over, but we
still have to do the work."</TE>
<TE>   Initially, resort groups such as MGM Mirage Inc., the biggest
operator on the Strip, challenged claims that workload had increased
at all. But after weeks of negotiations, the union won detailed
contract language that reduces overall workloads for housekeepers.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Taylor said, it's time to move on to kitchen help and
porters, who also complain of growing workloads.</TE>
<TE>   "I view this as a step in the process to give service workers the
ability to have some control over the amount of work they have to
do," he said. "This wasn't the end. It was a beachhead."</TE>

<HD>Hahn's Pothole Strategy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn is trying to buy enough Pothole
Killers, asphalt-toting trucks that fill street crevices twice as
quickly as a two-person crew, to patch every city pothole within
hours of a complaint.</LD>
<LD>   He's dispatched white-gloved traffic officers to Ventura
Boulevard, launched monthly "Meet the Mayor" sessions with
constituents and invited Blake Nordstrom, president of the department
store known for its attentive salespeople, to lecture the city's
general managers on how to treat customers.</LD>
<LD>   "Sometimes bureaucrats think the customer is the rule book, the
customer is the regulation, instead of realizing these are real
people and real businesses that need our help," he said in January.
"We want customers who are going to rave about us, who are going to
love us, and that's how we're going to keep everybody in this city."</LD>
<TE>   For Hahn, however, that philosophy--inherited partly from his
father, late county Supervisor Kenneth Hahn--has met its test in the
campaigns for secession by Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley.
Those breakaway movements will be on the ballot Nov. 5, and some
question whether there is time for Hahn's approach, which he sees as
the city's best defense against breakup, to register in a city as
large as Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "People have only intermittent contact with city government," said
UC San Diego political scientist Steve Erie, who studies Los Angeles
politics. "The question is, are they going to notice the difference?"</TE>
<TE>   To be effective, according to secession supporters and others,
Hahn's devotion to detail should be part of a larger, more inspiring
vision for the city. Making constituents happy, they say, might work
over the long haul but not quickly enough to affect the outcome of
the secession debate.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think sticking a couple cops on the corners is going to
make a difference," said J. Richard Leyner, a commercial real estate
executive who is on the board of Valley VOTE, a pro-secession
organization. "The kinds of things we want taken care of, they can't
be done in the next five months."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, who also is raising money and helping orchestrate the
political campaign against secession, said he does not harbor any
illusions that his administration can effect enough change before
election day to satisfy every discontented resident.</TE>
<TE>   "The difficulty you have is one year versus however many years
people have been steamed up about something," he said in an
interview. "I don't know if we'll be able to change everybody's
minds, but we're going to hammer this point home: The things you are
mad about, we're working on."</TE>
<TE>   To that end, the mayor has made customer service a priority during
his first year in office. The Department of Building and Safety has
issued a money-back guarantee promising that people seeking permits
for construction improvements will be helped within an hour. The
Department of Transportation has made improvements at 25
intersections identified as the worst in the city, and is working on
another 25.</TE>
<TE>   In September, the biggest of the customer-service initiatives is
expected to debut, when the city opens a new 311 call center.
Operators will be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide
basic information about city services and connect callers to
departments for assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Last Thursday, Hahn met individually with 20 residents at the Van
Nuys City Hall, the first of what he promises will be monthly
sessions with his constituents. Those residents were randomly
selected from 136 people who asked for time with the mayor.</TE>
<TE>   Electrician Gilbert Monteverde drove up from Wilmington to
complain to Hahn about broken sidewalks along his street.
Monteverde's neighbor Michael Duncan, who uses a wheelchair, once got
stuck for an hour on the uneven concrete.</TE>
<TE>   "When he goes to the park, he has to travel on the street, which
is a real hazard," Monteverde told the mayor.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to fix it," said Hahn, as he shuffled through photos of
the sidewalk cracks Monteverde brought with him. A crew would be out
shortly, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Monteverde said that after three frustrating months of not
being able to get through to anyone in the city, it was refreshing to
be able to talk to the mayor himself.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an open-door policy that gives us an opportunity to speak
our minds," he said. "I think it's great."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's commitment to personal service is in part a legacy of his
father, who held office in Los Angeles for decades.</TE>
<TE>   When he was a city councilman, Kenneth Hahn once got a phone call
from a woman whose garbage had not been picked up, the mayor
recounted in a recent interview. So the city councilman drove to her
house, picked up the trash and took it to the dump.</TE>
<TE>   "His theory, which was the right one, was that this lady will tell
everybody on the street, 'The city councilman himself came out to
pick up my trash,' " the mayor said.</TE>
<TE>   If residents don't have faith that their garbage will be picked up
and their trees trimmed, they will not rally around broader goals for
the city, the mayor said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the end-all and be-all, but if you don't get the nuts
and bolts of government done right, the other stuff is very difficult
to achieve," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   So Hahn has tried to tend to the basics: He launched two
information vans to drive around the city with resources for the
elderly; assigned members of his business team to hold office hours
in the Valley once a week; and attempted to eliminate the city's
backlog of outstanding bills.</TE>
<TE>   "The city had a reputation for being slow-paying, and it seems
to be changing," said Steve Panagetopulos, the owner of Ferdman
Engraving, which received $5,402 in overdue payments last winter.
"Now I know I don't have to go chasing my money all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Aides to Hahn argue that voters care more about their services
than about a mayor who inspires them in speeches.</TE>
<TE>   "If you talk to people about what's right and wrong with the city,
people aren't going to say, 'We don't have a grand enough vision
about such and such,' " said Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook. "They're
probably going to reflect on a personal anecdote, like a broken curb
or clean streets."</TE>
<TE>   Despite critics who say that Hahn's approach might work if given
years, rather than five months, his determination to address
secession as a customer-service problem is applauded by some business
and labor leaders, who believe changing the city's reputation will
give secessionists less firepower.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the change that needs to happen in the city," said Julie
Butcher, general manager of SEIU Local 347, the largest city employee
union. "Every city worker needs to understand that their job is to
serve the public, in every way."</TE>
<TE>   But others say Hahn's push for customer service may be too narrow
to move the electorate this fall.</TE>
<TE>   "Over time it might have an effect, but it doesn't grab the
imagination," said Fred Siegel, a senior fellow at the Progressive
Policy Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's most powerful weapon may be not only delivering what
residents expect, but inspiring them about what the city can
ultimately become, some experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be both a manager and a leader in these tough
situations," said Stephen Goldsmith, a former mayor of Indianapolis
who is now a professor of public management at Harvard University.
"Mayors, particularly in times of crises, are both symbols of the
community's spirit and are cheerleaders for that."</TE>
<TE>   But some irritated residents have tired of waiting.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the mayor came into this when the movement was a little
too far gone," said Granada Hills resident Kim Thompson, who is
planning on running for city council in the new Valley city. "It's
too little, too late."</TE>

<DH>Mention of hell from pulpits is at an all-time low. The
downplaying of damnation shows the influence of secularism on
Christian theology.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON and WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Faris believes in hell, that frightful nether world where the
thermostat is always set on high, where sinners toil for eternity in
unspeakable torment.</LD>
<LD>   But you'd never know it listening to him preach at his south
Orange County evangelical church. He never mentions the topic; his
flock shows little interest in it.</LD>
<LD>   "It isn't sexy enough anymore," said Faris, pastor of Crown Valley
Vineyard Christian Fellowship.</LD>
<TE>   In churches across America, hell is being frozen out as clergy
find themselves increasingly hesitant to sermonize on Christianity's
outpost for lost souls.</TE>
<TE>   The violence and torture that Dante described in the "Inferno" and
that Hieronymus Bosch illustrated on canvas centuries ago have become
cultural fossils in most mainstream Christian denominations, a story
line that no longer resonates with churchgoers.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a shift in religion from focusing on what happens
in the next life to asking, 'What is the quality of this life we're
leading now?' " said Harvey Cox Jr., an eminent author, religious
historian and professor at the Harvard Divinity School. "You can go
to a whole lot of churches week after week, and you'd be startled
even to hear a mention of hell."</TE>
<TE>   Hell's fall from fashion indicates how key portions of Christian
theology have been influenced by a secular society that stresses
individualism over authority and the human psyche over moral
absolutes. The rise of psychology, the philosophy of existentialism
and the consumer culture have all dumped buckets of water on hell.</TE>
<TE>   The tendency to downplay damnation has grown in recent years as
nondenominational ministries, with their focus on everyday issues
such as child-rearing and career success, have proliferated and
loyalty to churches has deteriorated.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just too negative," said Bruce Shelley, a senior professor
of church history at the Denver Theological Seminary. "Churches are
under enormous pressure to be consumer-oriented. Churches today feel
the need to be appealing rather than demanding."</TE>
<TE>   A 1998 poll by Barna Research Group, a Ventura company that
studies Christian trends nationwide, found that church-shopping has
become a way of life: One in seven adults changes churches each year;
one in six regularly rotates among congregations.</TE>
<TE>   That fickleness has helped give rise to
"megachurches"--evangelical congregations of more than 2,000 people
that mix Scripture with social and recreational programs in a casual
atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   Megachurches routinely pay for market research on what will draw
people to their ministries and keep them coming back.</TE>
<TE>   "Once pop evangelism went into market analysis, hell was just
dropped," said Martin Marty, professor emeritus of religion and
culture at the University of Chicago Divinity School. "When churches
go door to door and conduct a market analysis ... they hear, 'I want
better parking spaces. I want guitars at services. I want to have my
car greased while I'm in church.' "</TE>
<TE>   Hell is far from dead. A May 2001 Gallup poll of adults nationwide
found that 71% believe in hell.</TE>
<TE>   They just don't want to hear about it.</TE>
<TE>   Log onto www.pastors.com, the Web site run by Lake Forest's
Saddleback Church, whose senior pastor, Rick Warren, says the Bible's
teachings on hell guide his ministry. Scan the list of sermons for
sale. There are sermons on abortion, addiction and ambition.
Laughter, leadership and love. War, work and worry. More than 350
topics in all.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing on hell.</TE>
<TE>   Even among some "born-again" churches, hell is a rare topic of
conversation. Born-again Christians believe in hell, but they also
believe that their decision to embrace Christ has earned them a
one-way ticket in the other direction.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have a group of people who are born again, you're not
going to hell," said Bob Anderson, 51, a lawyer who attends an
evangelical church in Fullerton. "So why talk about it?"</TE>
<TE>   Traditional denominations also have pushed hell to the margins.
The Presbyterian Church (USA)'s first catechism, drawn up a few years
ago by a committee, mentions hell only once.</TE>
<TE>   George Hunsinger, a professor at Princeton Theological Seminary
and the catechism's principal author, would have liked the document
to address hell more directly and "talk about divine judgment in a
responsible way." But the committee rejected the idea without much
debate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a failure of nerve by churches that are not wanting to take
on a non-popular stance," Hunsinger said.</TE>
<TE>   Where once hell was viewed as a literal, geographic location, it
is more often seen now as a state of the soul.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Pope John Paul II made headlines by saying that hell
should be seen not as a fiery underworld but as "the state of those
who freely and definitively separate themselves from God, the source
of all life and joy."</TE>
<TE>   As much as that seemed like a departure from church beliefs, the
pope's words weren't all that new. The Roman Catholic Church in the
1960s moved away from the view of hell as a gothic torture chamber as
part of the Second Vatican Council's modernization of church
teachings.</TE>
<TE>   New Catechism</TE>
<TE>   Softens Language</TE>
<TE>   Individual priests kept hell's fires burning for years, aided by a
Catholic catechism of beliefs published in 1891 whose tone one priest
calls "positively medieval." A new catechism, published in 1994, uses
gentler language and emphasizes that hell's chief punishment is the
separation from God.</TE>
<TE>   "When you take [hell] away as a threat, everything changes," said
the University of Chicago's Marty. "Who goes to confession anymore?
Time was, a [Catholic] church had 16 booths and people snaked around
the block. Today, a church might have one left."</TE>
<TE>   One measure of hell's continued decline can be found in the
changed attitude of the Rev. Billy Graham, who came to prominence in
the 1940s as a fire-and-brimstone Gospel preacher. His depiction of
hell was unequivocal, an unpleasant address for unrepentant sinners.</TE>
<TE>   Even Graham has reconsidered hell--not whether it exists, but what
it is.</TE>
<TE>   " ... I believe that hell is essentially separation from God. That
we are separated from God, so we can have hell in this life and hell
in the life to come ... ," Graham told an interviewer in 1991. "But
to describe hell in vivid terms like I might have done 30 or 40 years
ago, I'm not at liberty to do that because ... whether there is
actually fire in hell or not, I do not know."</TE>
<TE>   The history of hell is long and complex, a product of evolving
religious thought that has shaped--and been shaped by--literature,
art and popular culture.</TE>
<TE>   Hell's roots are tangled up in the Hades of Greek mythology and
the ancient Hebrew concept of Sheol--locales where the dead, both
good and bad, resided.</TE>
<TE>   Hell became more hellish when the early Christians infused it with
a serious fear factor.</TE>
<TE>   Jesus is quoted in the Bible describing hell as the "outer
darkness" consumed by an "everlasting fire." The book of Revelation
warned that sinners would be "thrown into the lake of fire."
Matthew's Gospel offered a soundtrack: the "weeping and gnashing of
teeth."</TE>
<TE>   During the Middle Ages and through the Renaissance, a lurid image
of hell was firmly cemented in people's minds.</TE>
<TE>   Dante wrote that within the seventh circle of hell runs "the river
of blood, within which boiling is/Whoe'er by violence doth injure
others."</TE>
<TE>   Bosch depicted naked souls being devoured by a birdlike creature,
pierced by spears and tormented by half-human demons.</TE>
<TE>   For churches, the fear of hell became a colorful--and
effective--tool to teach the consequences of a sinful life devoid of
God.</TE>
<TE>   In the centuries to come, scientific discoveries and the European
Enlightenment would crack hell's veneer, undercutting all things
supernatural and questioning whether a merciful God would be so
cruel.</TE>
<TE>   Amid this rethinking, more palatable theories of hell have
developed: Souls not ticketed for heaven simply cease to be. Hell is
a temporary state before heaven. Everyone goes to heaven.</TE>
<TE>   "How can something as wonderful as redemption ... be based on
fear?" asked Father Wilfredo Benitez of St. Anselm of Canterbury
Episcopal Church in Garden Grove.</TE>
<TE>   As a young preacher, Benitez warned nonbelievers that they would
burn in Satan's lair. He later dropped the tactic. "Can we accept a
gift at gunpoint? This is total nonsense and madness."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps more than any other pastor, the Rev. Robert H. Schuller is
credited with inspiring the movement to supplant hell with feel-good
messages.</TE>
<TE>   The "Hour of Power" televangelist is founder of the Crystal
Cathedral in Garden Grove, a forerunner of the thousands of
nondenominational congregations that have popped up in recent decades
to serve believers uncomfortable with the formality of old-line
faiths.</TE>
<TE>   Schuller is another believer in the concept of hell as an eternal
separation from God. Yet he stopped preaching on the subject 40 years
ago, moving on to a theology that stressed individual success in such
books as "If It's Going to Be, It's Up to Me!"</TE>
<TE>   "I don't ever want people to become Christian to escape hell,"
Schuller said.</TE>
<TE>   His take: Why threaten people with God's stick when dangling a
carrot is enough to close the deal?</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Ray Comfort embraces the stick--and isn't afraid to
use it.</TE>
<TE>   A Protestant preacher from Bellflower and the author and publisher
of dozens of religious books, Comfort is fast becoming a rarity: a
pastor who unabashedly delivers an unpopular message.</TE>
<TE>   Hell is real, Comfort believes. Break even one of the Ten
Commandments, do not seek God's mercy, and you will go there. And it
will be as bad as advertised in the New Testament.</TE>
<TE>   The Church as</TE>
<TE>   Moral Compass</TE>
<TE>   Churches that abandon their role as moral compasses by ignoring or
sugarcoating the Bible's warning will become irrelevant, Comfort
said.</TE>
<TE>   "God will remove his spirit, his power from them, and they'll
become just like social clubs," Comfort said.</TE>
<TE>   "What we've done is make things comfortable for people with padded
pews and air-conditioning and a promise that we won't say anything
that will offend you."</TE>
<TE>   The 52-year-old New Zealand transplant crisscrosses the country to
preach at churches that still embrace his tough-love approach to
Scripture.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, Comfort reached out to the lost--mostly young
urbanites--from atop a plastic storage crate in Santa Monica every
Friday night. He was twice beaten up for his efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm like a police officer who's going into a group of criminals,"
he said one recent day before stepping on the crate before a crowd of
heckling students at Cal State Long Beach. "I know I won't be Mr.
Popular."</TE>

<HD>Grand Jury Rebukes Church on Sex Abuse</HD>
<DH>Clergy: New York Legislature is urged to pass sweeping
measures to root out molesters and punish those who protect them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A grand jury issued a scathing attack Tuesday on the Roman Catholic
Church's handling of sex abuse complaints, urging new legislation to
make it a felony whenever church officials fail to immediately report
child molestation claims.</LD>
<LD>   The 13-page report by a Westchester County grand jury, the result
of a two-month investigation into sexual abuse of children by priests
in the county, calls on the New York Legislature to pass sweeping
measures to root out molesters and punish church officials who cover
up their crimes.</LD>
<LD>   The church's treatment of complaints amounted to "an orchestrated
effort to protect abusing clergy members from investigation, arrest
and prosecution," the report charges.</LD>
<TE>   Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the New York Archdiocese, called
the report "unbalanced, unfair and inaccurate."</TE>
<TE>   "The archdiocese will continue to do all that we can to protect
children and young people in accord with our policy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury reviewed tens of thousands of pages of documents
and heard from eight alleged victims of abuse by priests in the Roman
Catholic Church.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury also recommended removing the statute of
limitations when the victim of a sex crime is a minor, making it a
crime for any individual or organization to allow a known sex
offender access to children and barring confidentiality clauses when
settling civil lawsuits in pedophilia cases.</TE>
<TE>   The panel said it found a disturbing pattern of abusers plying
their young victims with alcohol and cigarettes to gain their trust.</TE>
<TE>   Zwilling said the church requested a Friday hearing before a judge
to discuss the report.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Edward M. Egan has already agreed to notify area
prosecutors of sex abuse allegations before conducting an internal
review.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese has given prosecutors files on 35 years worth of
sex abuse cases and has suspended several priests pending further
investigations.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, at least 250 priests have either been dismissed from
their duties or have resigned since the sex abuse scandal erupted in
Boston early this year.</TE>

<HD>Kids Getting Antibiotics Less, Study Finds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>CHICAGO -- Researchers on Tuesday reported a dramatic drop in
antibiotic prescriptions for children, a development they called good
news in the fight to keep germs from becoming resistant to overused
drugs.</LD>
<LD>   "The results of this study are very encouraging," said David
Fleming, acting director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.</LD>
<LD>   "However, antimicrobial resistance remains a major public health
problem, so we must continue to stress the importance of using
antibiotics effectively," he said.</LD>
<TE>   The CDC study, published in this week's Journal of the American
Medical Assn., came from a survey of office-based physicians. It
found that the number of antibiotic prescriptions for children fell
from 46 million in 1989 to 30 million in 2000, even though the number
of office visits remained constant.</TE>
<TE>   The agents covered in the survey included penicillin and
erythromycin, among others. Antibiotics are the most frequently
prescribed drugs for children, used to treat such ills as sore
throat, upper respiratory tract infection, inflammation of the middle
ear and bronchitis.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a dramatic decline," said Linda F. McCaig, an epidemiologist
at the National Center for Health Statistics, the organization that
regularly surveys the prescribing behavior of American physicians.
"It's encouraging that parents and physicians may be getting the
message about how to use antibiotics appropriately."</TE>
<TE>   The study said antimicrobial prescribing rates for children
increased by 48% in the United States from 1980 through 1992, until
health officials sounded alarms that inappropriate use was
contributing to antimicrobial resistance.</TE>
<TE>   When antibiotics are used they can kill pathogens but leave behind
others that are resistant. Prescribing drugs that are not warranted
adds to the problem.</TE>

<HD>Last Hurrah for Big 'Soft' Spenders?</HD>
<DH>Finance: Fund-raiser for GOP with president coincides with
FEC meeting on new rules.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK FINEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>More than 5,000 of America's corporate and political elite will pack
the Washington Convention Center tonight, plunking down a near-record
$25 million to dine with President Bush and, just maybe, influence
the outcome of this year's federal elections.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight's Republican House-Senate Presidential Dinner may well be
notable for reasons even beyond the amount raised. It's likely to be
one of the last great gushers of soft money--the hundreds of millions
of dollars in unregulated campaign contributions from once-prohibited
sources that critics say have fundamentally corrupted American
politics during the last decade.</LD>
<LD>   In the hours leading up to the affair, the six-member Federal
Election Commission will meet nearby to vote on regulations that
purport to ban federal soft-money fund-raising after the Nov. 5
election.</LD>
<TE>   The proposed rules have emerged from a bitterly contentious battle
between the congressional authors of a hard-fought campaign-finance
reform law and FEC commissioners over how the agency plans to
translate the legislation into regulations.</TE>
<TE>   An earlier set of regulations provoked protests from the law's
sponsors and reform supporters, who papered the FEC with written
critiques and registered their complaints at an agency hearing this
month. They accused the FEC of trying to weaken the law's soft-money
ban with narrow definitions and ambiguous language.</TE>
<TE>   Soft money is generally defined as large political donations from
corporations, labor unions and other special interest groups for
issue ads and voter education. As long as the money is not used
directly on an election campaign, federal limits on contributions
don't apply. But the use of this unrestricted money to influence
voters and politicians through other means has ballooned into the
hundreds of millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The FEC released a revised, 318-page final draft of the
regulations this week that attempted to address some of the
lawmakers' most pressing concerns by tentatively expanding the
definition of who and what will be covered by the soft-money ban.</TE>
<TE>   But the revisions were written by FEC staff members and two
commissioners. The soft-money feeding frenzy will not be over until
the final vote of the full FEC board--if then. The commission
includes members who have been openly antagonistic to
campaign-finance reform for years. They and other opponents of the
reform law believe it violates 1st Amendment rights.</TE>
<TE>   FEC spokesman Robert Biersack cautioned Tuesday: "This is not the
final word. The commissioners could conceivably change things at the
table."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, two Republican commissioners posted amendments Tuesday
night on the FEC Web site that they intend to introduce today.
Reformers say the measures would continue to permit soft money to be
used for attack ads on federal candidates and weaken other provisions
of the ban.</TE>
<TE>   Few analysts predict that the commissioners will approve the
revisions as is, and most are bracing for fights, even if the final
draft passes as written.</TE>
<TE>   The commission's three Republicans include two conservative
intellectuals who have publicly opposed campaign-finance reform in
the past: Chairman David M. Mason and Commissioner Bradley A. Smith.
President Bush named the third Republican, Michael E. Toner, who was
chief counsel to Bush's presidential campaign and the Republican
National Committee, as a recess appointment that bypassed Senate
confirmation two days after the president signed the reform act.</TE>
<TE>   Of the three Democratic commissioners, Karl J. Sandstrom, whose
term has expired, represents a potential tiebreaker for the
Republicans, having sided with them on occasion, according to
independent and partisan analysts.</TE>
<TE>   "The rules are better than they could have been, but still fall
far short of what they need to be," the reform act's four
congressional sponsors declared in a joint statement issued Tuesday
night.</TE>
<TE>   The sponsors were Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Russell D.
Feingold (D-Wis.), and Reps. Martin T. Meehan (D-Mass.) and
Christopher Shays (R-Conn.).</TE>
<TE>   The revised rules, the statement said, "unfortunately leave open
the question of whether two critical goals of the new law will be
achieved--to prevent state parties from using soft money to influence
federal elections and to prevent federal candidates and
office-holders from raising, spending or receiving soft-money
contributions.</TE>
<TE>   "The FEC's duty is to enforce and implement the law, not rewrite
it or create loopholes in it. We will be watching carefully what the
FEC does on these key issues."</TE>
<TE>   The battle lines are drawn largely over definitions. The bill's
sponsors and their supporters want the broadest definitions for the
soft-money ban. The political parties, labor unions and independent
groups have lobbied the FEC for narrower interpretations.</TE>
<TE>   In its early version of the proposed rules published last month,
the FEC defined "agent" narrowly, suggesting that only someone with
written or oral authority to act for a federal party or candidate
would be barred from taking and spending such contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Such narrow definitions, the law's sponsors argued in a recent
letter to the FEC, "create loopholes through which the existing
system could continue to operate."</TE>
<TE>   The final rules issued Monday expanded the definition of agent to
include "implied" authority but stopped short of granting the
sponsors' appeal that it cover even "apparent" connections between a
state committee and federal candidates or parties.</TE>
<TE>   This week's meeting won't settle all the regulatory issues. For
example, the board is not addressing changes to limits on individual
campaign contributions to candidates and disclosure requirements. The
FEC is voting only on soft-money reforms and deferring some of the
most critical definitions.</TE>
<TE>   Trevor Potter, a McCain advisor who served for more than three
years as an FEC commissioner, said the commission has "postponed and
placed in limbo the single biggest issue": what rules should apply to
the use of soft money by state parties for issue ads that effectively
target or promote political candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the principal problems with the current system is that the
state parties can take soft money and run what are indisputably
federal attack ads," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dubbed "sham issue ads" or "attack ads" by critics, such
advertising has drawn the lion's share of the soft money raised by
the political parties in recent years--and the ire of soft-money
critics.</TE>
<TE>   The final rules signal that the commission will decide sometime in
the future what kinds of issue ads or television commercials can be
financed by the unregulated funds at the state level.</TE>
<TE>   The loophole that has permitted the massive corporate and union
contributions at the federal level in recent years was created in the
late 1970s, when the FEC decided to permit corporations and
unions--barred from donating directly to federal parties or
candidates--to make contributions to national political parties for
"nonfederal activities," such as traditional voter registration
drives.</TE>
<TE>   But a study last year by the New York-based Brennan Center for
Justice found that, after years of expansion of the rules by the
parties and the FEC, "by far, the single greatest share of soft-money
dollars spent by the parties relative to federal elections goes into
electioneering advertising for or against candidates."</TE>
<TE>   The new reforms still face a challenge in the federal courts. Even
so, McCain last week said he has a new target for reform: "the entire
Federal Election Commission." He said he is drafting legislation to
revamp the agency.</TE>

<HD>Brooklyn Dieter's Public Loss Is Gain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The results are in: Marty Markowitz, the admittedly hefty Brooklyn
borough president who put himself and 2.5 million other area
residents on a diet eight weeks ago, has lost 11 pounds.</LD>
<LD>   Svelte he is not. But still, the 5-foot-5 Markowitz, who tipped
the scales at 194 pounds when he started his well-publicized effort
to shed girth, is down to 183.</LD>
<LD>   "He is a 57-year-old man who wants to be around as long as he
can," spokesman Andrew Ross said Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   Ross said that Markowitz, whose father was a waiter in a
delicatessen, has confessed that eating is one of his favorite things
in the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, he will continue to eat sensibly and continue to try
to exercise," Ross said. "He is trying to change his lifestyle."</TE>
<TE>   Markowitz turned his official diet, which ended over the weekend,
into a public happening.</TE>
<TE>   He first invited people to join him in shedding pounds when he
learned that Brooklyn led the rest of New York City in deaths from
cardiovascular disease. The borough president asked constituents to
walk to work with him and to jog alongside him in public parks on the
weekends. Exercise equipment was set up for members of his staff at
Brooklyn's Borough Hall.</TE>
<TE>   The "Lighten Up Brooklyn" campaign established weigh-in stations
in 150 churches, drugstores, hospitals, gyms and recreational
centers, where dieters could measure their progress.</TE>
<TE>   More than 7,000 people recorded their weights during the
eight-week campaign. After the results are compiled, the neighborhood
that has shed the most pounds will receive recognition on national
television later this month.</TE>
<TE>   For the last two months, Markowitz has stressed that his effort
was a marathon, not a crash-diet sprint.</TE>
<TE>   He also confessed to having hunger pangs in the middle of the
night for his favorite foods: cheesecake and bread. He says he
resisted the temptation.</TE>

<HD>Thick Fires Stretch Resources Thin</HD>
<DH>Wildfires: Many factors go into deciding which blazes get
attention. Some are swarmed with help while others are allowed to
rage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>With two massive wildfires raging in the state, it's all authorities
can do to keep them from burning down vast subdivisions.</LD>
<LD>   The real difficulties come when they have to make the daily
decisions that determine which fire gets more fire crews and support.
Why are some fires swarmed with help and others allowed to burn?</LD>
<LD>   Why does the Hayman fire, burning across four counties south of
Denver, have three times the number of firefighters as the Missionary
Ridge blaze near Durango, the nation's priority fire on Tuesday?</LD>
<TE>   Fire officers at Durango report that residents are confused and
angry, wondering whether the implication is that their homes are not
worth saving like those in the wealthy subdivisions on Denver's
southern flank.</TE>
<TE>   "I know people think that, but once you understand the two fires,
it's not difficult to understand," said Mary Bell Lunsford, on the
Durango fire management team. Lunsford said the Missionary Ridge fire
is so dangerous that even if she had more crews, it wouldn't be safe
to use them.</TE>
<TE>   In the hectic business of fighting wildfires, it may appear that
fires near urban areas or in states with political clout, such as
California, receive more support, but officials say they carefully
allocate resources where they are needed, not just where they are
noticed. They prioritize fires according to threat to human life,
communities and natural resources such as endangered species.</TE>
<TE>   At 6 p.m. every day across the country, fire commanders prepare a
chilling inventory of each wildfire's destruction: Homes damaged,
subdivisions threatened, residents evacuated.</TE>
<TE>   By morning, at a 10 a.m. meeting, regional fire managers convene
to scan the reports and set the day's priorities, moving air tankers
and fire crews like pieces on a flaming chessboard.</TE>
<TE>   By midday, those working smaller, rural or remote fires gripe that
their request is overlooked, passed over in favor of a higher
priority fire in a more glamorous or populous area.</TE>
<TE>   "There's more to it than 'Hey you guys, send me more stuff!' "
said Lynn Young of the U.S. Forest Service. "Each day the incident
commanders predict the worst-case scenario on their fire. And each
incident commander would like to have everything he can get. There's
only so much to go around."</TE>
<TE>   Colorado's two major fires flared Tuesday. High temperatures and
high winds whipped the southern end of the Hayman fire, which has
grown to 115,000 acres. The northern end of the fire is as close as
25 miles to Denver.</TE>
<TE>   The 44,300-acre Missionary Ridge fire near Durango in southwestern
Colorado continued to cause evacuations. More than 2,400 structures
are threatened and 1,724 homes have been evacuated.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, more than 400,000 acres across the country were on
fire. At the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, fire
directors sent federal firefighting crews to areas where local
resources are exhausted. With so many fires, competition is fierce.</TE>
<TE>   Alice Forbes, the Forest Service's acting assistant director for
operations, laughed at the suggestion that fire managers might
overstate their case when seeking help.</TE>
<TE>   "The squeaky wheel theory?" Forbes said. "No, the way it works is
that the incident commanders who do the best job of providing the
[most specific] information we need get the help."</TE>
<TE>   Lunsford, of the Durango fire management team, acknowledged there
is competition among the regional fires for the experienced teams and
said she has requested more help for the Durango fire. But she said
fire managers' professionalism prevents them from asking for more
than they need.</TE>
<TE>   "Fire managers are highly professional and experienced," she said.
"Even though they want to put their fire out, they don't play those
games."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Wallis, who is among those making strategic decisions on the
Hayman fire, said if the pace of the fires continues, there may not
be enough firefighters to go around.</TE>
<TE>   "The competition is already growing, with fires starting in other
parts of the country," he said. "If we don't get to all of our
priorities, we're going to be asking fire managers to allow for fires
to get big. We do have a finite number of resources."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, authorities on Tuesday debated filing state charges
against Forest Service employee Terry Lynn Barton, whom federal
prosecutors have accused of starting the Hayman fire, the largest
wildfire in Colorado history.</TE>
<TE>   Barton is charged with willfully setting fire to timber in a
national forest, damaging federal property and making false
statements to investigators. She is due in court Thursday for a bond
hearing.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the U.S. attorney made the distinction Tuesday
between whether Barton accidentally or intentionally started the
fire. Prosecutors say Barton confessed to setting fire to a letter.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not saying she intended to light a campfire or set the
largest wildfire in Colorado history; we are saying she intentionally
set a fire," said Jeff Dorschner, spokesman for U.S. Atty. John W.
Suthers.</TE>

<HD>Health Care Gains Traction as Major Issue</HD>
<DH>Policy: For all the talk, any major initiative faces
enormous obstacles in Congress. Drug benefits and HMO rules remain
the big sticking points.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK and VICKI KEMPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Despite Washington's preoccupation with national
security, leaders of both parties are preparing for the possibility
that a different, kitchen-table issue will matter just as much to
voters come election day: health care.</LD>
<LD>   House Republicans began committee work Tuesday on legislation to
provide a new prescription drug benefit for senior citizens, a move
to neutralize an issue that Democratic candidates around the country
have made central to this year's congressional election campaigns.</LD>
<LD>   Also Tuesday, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) gave a speech
designed to jump-start debate on health issues that have languished
since Sept. 11. He laid out an agenda that ranged from targeted
measures such as a bill to promote the prevention of strokes to a
broad proposal to require large businesses to provide health
insurance.</LD>
<TE>   For all the talk, however, any major health initiative faces
enormous obstacles in Congress. The parties are deeply split on how
to help seniors cope with the rising cost of prescription drugs. They
have been deadlocked for a year over legislation to impose new
regulations on health maintenance organizations. Even legislation
backed by President Bush to expand coverage of mental illness faces
an uncertain future.</TE>
<TE>   Even if no legislation emerges this year, the intense
congressional maneuvering--especially over prescription drugs--could
help shape the midterm congressional elections, which will determine
which party will eventually be able to put its agenda into law.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy, in his speech, argued that health-care reform was "one of
the great unresolved issues of our society," because the problems of
the health-care system--rising costs, growing numbers of uninsured
people and abuses by managed health-care plans--have gotten worse
over the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   "We must put patients first and launch a new era of health
reform," said Kennedy, calling for a broad array of initiatives.
Among them was one to expand an existing health insurance program for
poor children. His proposal to expand employer-based health insurance
would require all businesses with 100 or more employees to offer
coverage.</TE>
<TE>   The speech, in its wide scope, illustrated key differences between
Democratic and Republican approaches to health-care policy and
highlighted why health-care legislation is so hard to pass in a
Congress so narrowly divided between the parties.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats generally support comprehensive, government-financed
programs and federally required benefits to reduce the number of
Americans without health insurance and to improve health-care
coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "The state of a family's health should not be determined by the
size of a family's wealth," Kennedy said.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans, on the other hand, are inclined to support tax-based
or private-sector initiatives and oppose government mandates that
might add to employers' cost of providing health coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "New mandates will cause health-care premiums to skyrocket and
hamstring employers' ability to effectively manage their health
plans," said Rep. Sam Johnson (R-Texas), chairman of a House
subcommittee that on Tuesday began a series of hearings on rising
health-care costs.</TE>
<TE>   At first glance, a Medicare prescription drug benefit appeared to
have everything necessary to sail through Congress: broad support
from both parties, backing from the White House, growing demand from
senior citizens--who also happen to be the age group most likely to
vote--and, not least, a clear need.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the Republican and Democratic proposals for a Medicare drug
benefit could hardly be more different.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican drug plan is less costly to taxpayers and less
generous to seniors, and it relies on private insurance companies and
pharmaceutical benefit managers to provide coverage and negotiate
drug discounts. Under the Democratic plan, taxpayers would pay more
and seniors would pay less for a government-provided benefit offered
through the Medicare program. Drug discounts would be negotiated by
the government.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Republican plan, the typical Medicare beneficiary would
pay a monthly premium of about $35, an annual deductible of $250, and
then 20% of drug costs from $251 to $1,000, 50% of costs from $1,001
to $2,000, and 100% of drug costs to about $4,000. The GOP benefit
offers 100% "catastrophic" coverage of costs beyond that amount.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposal offered by House Democrats, the monthly premium
is $25, the annual deductible $100 and the co-pay 20% up to a maximum
out-of-pocket cost of $2,000. The government would cover all drug
costs over $2,000.</TE>
<TE>   The difference of the plans' costs to taxpayers is even more
dramatic. The price tag for the House GOP drug plan is $310 billion
over 10 years, while programs proposed by Democrats would cost as
much as $800 billion over the same period. President Bush had called
for a $190-billion Medicare drug benefit.</TE>
<TE>   Two House committees are expected to approve the Republican bill
this week, and GOP leaders plan to bring it to a vote of the full
House next week.</TE>
<TE>   Two other health-care initiatives also are mired in partisan
differences, though both have been endorsed, at least in principle,
by Bush:</TE>
<TE>   * Legislation to impose new requirements on HMOs, the so-called
patients' bill of rights, has been stalled primarily by differences
over how much money patients should be able to win from HMOs if they
take them to court for injuries caused by poor treatment. Most
lawmakers have given the legislation up for dead, but the Supreme
Court could soon breathe new life into it when the justices issue a
ruling in an HMO case from Illinois. If the court strikes down that
state's patients' rights law--which is similar to laws in 41 other
states--it may give new impetus to efforts to write protections into
federal law.</TE>
<TE>   * Legislation to expand health insurance coverage for mental
illness is expected to come before the Senate this summer. But the
bill still faces resistance in the House, where the key sticking
point is the cost to employers of the bill, which requires health
insurance plans to treat mental illness like any other medical
disease.</TE>

<HD>Bush Submits Security Post Bill</HD>
<DH>Politics: It is left to Congress to come up with detailed
plans on homeland Cabinet-level agency. Plan sets rules on
intelligence sharing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKI KEMPER and NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- President Bush, working to reorganize the government
around an anti-terrorism mission, submitted to Congress a blueprint
Tuesday for a bureaucratic empire that would give a new Cabinet
secretary sweeping, largely undefined authority over intelligence,
immigration, public health, transportation and emergency response.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps most significantly, the legislation directs the FBI, the
CIA and other intelligence-collecting agencies to give the secretary
of the new Department of Homeland Security any and all information
they have on terrorist threats and on the vulnerabilities to attack
of infrastructures and key targets--nuclear power plants or the
banking system, for example.</LD>
<LD>   White House officials urged Congress to move quickly on the
legislation, but the Bush administration's bill to authorize the
transfer of 22 government agencies, more than 169,000 federal
employees and about $37 billion to the new department was short on
details.</LD>
<TE>   ''It's sort of a handoff,'' said a senior administration official,
who spoke to reporters on background. ''We're handing off to them and
now they've got to run with it.''</TE>
<TE>   Tom Ridge, Bush's homeland security director and a leading
candidate to head the new department, also called for prompt action
and for cooperation between the legislative and executive branches.</TE>
<TE>   ''As history has shown, when the Congress of the United States and
the president of the United States unite, no challenge is too great,
no cause is out of reach, no dream is impossible, whether it's
winning a world war, a cold war or the war on terrorism,'' he told
reporters at a news conference as he was flanked by Republican and
Democratic congressional leaders.</TE>
<TE>   The vagueness of the bill, which White House officials said
reflected the importance of ''managerial flexibility'' and speed in
setting up the department, could slow its passage through Congress,
where lawmakers like to spell out both the powers and the boundaries
of federal agencies.</TE>
<TE>   ''It's a disappointment,'' said Paul C. Light, vice president and
director of government studies at the nonpartisan Brookings
Institution, noting that the draft legislation was just 35 pages
long. ''It is a slapped-together approach that is destined for great
confusion, great difficulty and possible failure.''</TE>
<TE>   Some influential lawmakers also warned the White House to slow
down.</TE>
<TE>   ''I'm a little bit concerned about some people's need to rush this
thing through,'' said Sen. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.), ranking member of
the Governmental Affairs Committee, which will hold its first hearing
on the Bush proposal Thursday. ''Once we lock something in, it's
going to be there forever, whether it's a good idea or not.''</TE>
<TE>   Plans for the creation of a Homeland Security Department have been
on the fast track since June 6, when Bush reversed his long-standing
opposition to moving numerous security-related government functions
into one single department with Cabinet status--and turned the tables
on Congress. Lawmakers from both parties who had been working to win
Cabinet status for the security agency suddenly were put in the
position of responding to a White House proposal--and to repeated
entreaties from the president to put aside turf battles.</TE>
<TE>   Bush repeated that theme Tuesday, telling audience members at an
event dedicated to homeownership: ''It's going to be hard for some in
Congress to give up a little power here and there.''</TE>
<TE>   Yet top congressional leaders from both major parties are eager to
get the legislation to the president's desk as early as the
anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, and their determination showed
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) pledged to push the bill
''in a diligent manner'' and ''hopefully get it done as quickly as
possible.'' Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) urged
bipartisan cooperation. ''We know we have an overwhelming
responsibility,'' Daschle said, ''and I hope we can do it in an
expeditious manner.''</TE>
<TE>   The gears of Congress are already in motion. Senate Democrats,
over Republican opposition, already have pushed a bill through
committee that is similar to what Bush has proposed. And the House
today is expected to approve a resolution establishing a special
committee, chaired by Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas), to
shepherd the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   But the drive for fast action may be slowed by senior lawmakers
who are calling for careful evaluation of Bush's proposal,
particularly in what it does and does not say.</TE>
<TE>   The White House bill gives the Homeland Security secretary a great
deal of flexibility in determining the department's structure, as
well as sweeping powers over a wide range of government functions.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, for example, the power to define the rules for
all foreigners entering the country--from guest workers to tourists
and students--would be vested in that one person, said the senior
administration official.</TE>
<TE>   On intelligence matters, many members of the House and Senate
intelligence committees have their own ideas about reforming the FBI
and the CIA, and they want to ensure that the homeland security
legislation does not interfere with those plans.</TE>
<TE>   The White House bill, seeking to address widespread criticism of
intelligence failures before Sept. 11, gives the new department
primary responsibility for the coordination of terrorist-related
intelligence information.</TE>
<TE>   The department secretary and an undersecretary would be
responsible for analyzing threat information and determining and
addressing the vulnerability of infrastructures such as water
treatment systems and power plants.</TE>
<TE>   They would also be responsible for developing a long-term plan to
protect those infrastructures and other key targets, and for
administering a homeland security advisory system.</TE>
<TE>   White House officials said the legislation would give homeland
security officials ''very powerful access'' to intelligence
information, including raw data about terrorist threats.</TE>
<TE>   But some observers questioned whether anything could force the FBI
and the CIA to share raw intelligence data.</TE>
<TE>   ''There is no law known to humankind that could compel agencies to
do what they don't want to do,'' said Light.</TE>
<TE>   The White House continued to resist the demand of some lawmakers
to make the FBI part of the new department.</TE>
<TE>   ''The president is very clear,'' said the administration official.
''He supports what [FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III] is doing over
there and he thinks that the ... organizational integrity of the FBI
needs to be maintained.''</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), chairman of the Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence, said Congress should postpone major decisions on the
intelligence overhaul until next year, even if it creates the
Homeland Security Department this year.</TE>
<TE>   As expected, the White House bill clarified the role of UC
Berkeley's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, currently part of
the Energy Department. A homeland security division dedicated to
researching and developing technology to protect against biological
and nuclear terrorism would be based at Livermore, but the
laboratory's employees would not be transferred to the new
department.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's delivery of the president's bill appeared to end some of
the jockeying within the administration. Now any agency seeking to
change the Bush plan will have to appeal to Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Jonathan Peterson contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Senate Passes Bill to Shield Insurers</HD>
<DH>Liability: The measure's fate is uncertain because of
controversy over whether people injured in terrorist attacks can seek
punitive damages.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Senate on Tuesday approved a measure that would provide a
temporary federal backstop to insurance companies in the event of a
future terrorist attack, but the bill faces an uncertain fate--even
though Democrats and Republicans agree it is urgently needed.</LD>
<LD>   The vote sets the stage for negotiations between the
Democratic-led Senate and the Republican-controlled House, especially
over the issue of whether individuals injured in a terrorist attack
should be permitted to sue for punitive damages.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush's economic advisors have said they would recommend
a veto if the bill includes the Senate provision allowing such
lawsuits. The House measure does not include that provision.</LD>
<TE>   The Senate measure, approved 84 to 14, would require insurers to
pay claims based on their market share. The government then would pay
80% of the remaining losses up to $10 billion and 90% above $10
billion. The program would be capped at $100 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to deal with homeland security to protect our
personal security from terrorist attack," said Sen. Christopher J.
Dodd (D-Conn.). "We also need to be talking about economic security."</TE>
<TE>   Insurers have stopped writing terrorist insurance policies or have
dramatically raised premiums, making it difficult for businesses to
secure loans for projects.</TE>
<TE>   Julie Rochman, a spokeswoman for the American Insurance Assn.,
said that although there is still "a lot of work left to be done,"
the vote shows a bipartisan commitment to "secure the American
economy by putting a terrorism reinsurance backstop in place."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Michael G. Oxley (R-Ohio), chairman of the House Financial
Services Committee, thanked the Senate for "finally acting" on the
insurance bill.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, about nine months after 9/11, we can get serious about
resolving the many differences that exist between the House and the
Senate pieces of legislation," he said. "It's high time we set about
this work, as a lack of available terrorism insurance is clearly
creating a drag on our economy."</TE>
<TE>   "This has been a test [of] whether we can meet the post-9/11
challenge," said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). "Government is
going to have to play a larger role.... The private sector could not
solve this problem alone."</TE>
<TE>   The insurance industry expects to be able to pay the estimated $50
billion in claims stemming from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. But
industry officials say they cannot continue to insure against the
incalculable liability from a future attack without government help.
Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, praised the Senate for acting. But he complained that the
Senate bill contains a "glaring loophole that could force victims of
terrorist attacks to pay punitive damages for the acts of
terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said the measure is "vitally
needed to mitigate the economic drag we are currently experiencing
due to the scarcity of terrorism insurance and to minimize adverse
economic consequences from possible future attacks."</TE>
<TE>   However, O'Neill said he was disappointed that the measure did not
include protections against "abusive litigation and punitive damages
claims. Such procedures are crucial to the protection of American
taxpayers' interests and needs to be included in any final
legislation."</TE>

told the closed-door session what they knew about the Sept. 11
attacks at the time and what they have since discovered by studying
their files for missed warnings and clues.</LD>
<LD>   Committee members hinted that they had picked up on ''new
information'' about missed warning signs, but no details emerged from
the hearing.</LD>
<TE>   Members said the three agency chiefs delivered lengthy classified
briefings on how Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network has
used a compartmentalized cell system and strict operational security
to prevent penetration by outsiders.</TE>
<TE>   ''It was very comprehensive,'' Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), chairman
of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, told reporters during
a break.</TE>
<TE>   Graham said the chief ''topic for today'' was the Sept. 11 plot,
from the original concept of turning passenger planes into guided
missiles through the recruitment, training, financing, coordination
and command structure of the four skyjacking teams.</TE>
<TE>   Graham said the Sept. 11 planning apparently started shortly after
Al Qaeda operatives detonated truck bombs under the U.S. embassies in
Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, in August 1998. The
blasts killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, and put Bin Laden
in the public spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   He said Al Qaeda ''tends to be a repetitive organization,'' with
three years between the time they identify a target and actually
attacking it. But since several plots may be underway at one time, he
added, ''they tend to hit a target about once every 12 to 18
months.''</TE>
<TE>   U.S. authorities believe that the Sept. 11 plot probably was
conceived and broadly directed by Al Qaeda leaders then in
Afghanistan; planned by a cell in Hamburg, Germany; funded with money
wired from the Middle East; and carried out by zealots who mostly had
legally entered the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Only two people alleged to be part of the plot are known to be in
custody. Al Qaeda's operations leader, Abu Zubeida, was captured in
March in Pakistan and has undergone extensive interrogation by the
FBI and the CIA. French citizen Zacarias Moussaoui was in an
immigration jail in Minnesota on Sept. 11 and now awaits trial on
charges of conspiring with the hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   Numerous other alleged terrorists, including Khalid Shaikh
Mohammed, who allegedly conceived of the plot and may have helped
recruit the Hamburg cell, remain at large.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet's and Mueller's statements took most of the two-hour morning
session, and Hayden spoke in the afternoon. Four committee
members--Sens. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.) and Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and
Reps. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) and Jane Harman (D-Venice)--were
designated to lead the questioning.</TE>
<TE>   Chambliss told reporters that he wanted to ask about ''what appear
to be very overt deficiencies'' in the collection and analysis of
intelligence. Other members indicated interest in communication
lapses, inadequate spy technology and poor coordination of the spy
services.</TE>
<TE>   Aides said Mueller would face questions about the FBI's failure to
aggressively investigate Moussaoui before Sept. 11, and why it
ignored a July memo from an Arizona agent recommending that flight
schools be checked for potential terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet was to be grilled on what the CIA knew about two skyjackers
whom it first tracked at a meeting in Malaysia in January 2000. Both
men soon entered the United States, but the CIA didn't warn the FBI
about them until much later.</TE>
<TE>   The NSA has largely escaped public notice, but several lawmakers
pressed Hayden about ''what they had known'' before Sept. 11,
according to a Senate aide who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   The NSA is responsible for intercepting communication, from
telephones to e-mails, of America's adversaries around the world and
breaking the codes they use. It has the largest staff of America's 13
intelligence agencies and, at $7 billion, a budget larger than the
CIA and the FBI combined.</TE>
<TE>   ''NSA collects a lot of information,'' the aide said. ''They
translate only a portion of it, they analyze only a smaller portion
of that, and they disseminate even a smaller portion of that. That's
something the committee wants to scrutinize.''</TE>
<TE>   James Bamford, author of two books on the NSA, said that the
global explosion of cell phones and Internet access has hampered the
NSA's ability to monitor terrorist groups.</TE>
<TE>   ''Technology has now become NSA's enemy to a large degree,'' he
said. Terrorists ''are very careful in communication security,'' he
noted, and are harder to track than the NSA's chief Cold War targets.
''It has to be totally retooled for these types of demands.''</TE>
<TE>   The committee has had a rough start, battling problems over
staffing, priorities and the hearing schedule. ''I think that's blown
over,'' the Senate aide said. ''People realize that if the
investigation is going to be thorough, its going to take some time.''</TE>
<TE>   The closed-door testimony will continue today. Tenet and Mueller
are tentatively scheduled to appear next week in a session open to
the public. The panel has pledged to investigate intelligence lapses,
identify problems in the $30-billion intelligence apparatus and
recommend remedies before Congress adjourns at the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere on the terrorism front, federal prosecutors urged a
federal judge to reject a motion from Moussaoui that had demanded his
immediate release from jail. Moussaoui, who is representing himself,
said authorities are wrongfully trying to link him to the Sept. 11
hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   But the Justice Department said in a court filing that Moussaoui
has offered ''no specific evidence supporting his claim that the FBI
was conducting surveillance of him before his arrest in August 2001,
nor has he explained how any such surveillance exonerates him, let
alone requires his release.''</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Police investigating the disappearance of 14-year-old Elizabeth Smart
said Tuesday that, contrary to what they reported earlier, the
kidnapper did not threaten the girl's little sister or even realize
she saw him.</LD>
<LD>   Two weeks ago, Elizabeth was reportedly taken by gunpoint from the
bed shared by the two girls. Police said initially that the kidnapper
warned 9-year-old Mary Katherine Smart to remain quiet and that the
little sister waited two hours before alerting her parents.</LD>
<LD>   But police who interviewed the youngster three times now say that
the man did not speak to the child.</LD>
<TE>   "The threat was not made to Mary Katherine," Capt. Scott Atkinson
said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the police account changed as investigators with skills at
interviewing child witnesses talked to the girl. Police also reviewed
the 9-year-old witness' earlier two interviews with police, Atkinson
said. "I don't believe that she's changed her story," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As for the search for the kidnapper, "we believe this man may be a
trusted person in the neighborhood or community," the police captain
said. The kidnapper was calm and "spoke nicely and dressed nicely."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators still want to talk to Bret Michael Edmunds, a
drifter who continues to elude them. Edmunds was spotted near the
Smart home two days before Elizabeth's disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   The community is offering a $250,000 reward for the girl's safe
return.</TE>

<HD>U.S. to Step Up Luggage Checks Plan Outlined for Explosives
Check</HD>
<DH>Security: Airline passengers will increasingly have to open
checked bags for inspection. The action will be part of a federal
airport protection takeover.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Millions of airline passengers will soon be asked to
open their checked bags for explosives inspection, federal officials
said Tuesday as they outlined new details of the government's planned
takeover of airport security.</LD>
<LD>   The added inconvenience to travelers, experts said, will be the
price of trying to meet a Dec. 31 deadline for screening all checked
bags with explosives detection equipment. "People do not like someone
going through their personal effects in their checked baggage," said
David Stempler, president of the Air Travelers Assn., an advocacy
group for travelers.  "They are going to have to grin and bear it."</LD>
<LD>   The security checks should take no more than two-and-a-half
minutes, officials promised, citing results from a pilot program at
the Norfolk, Va., airport. International travelers are used to
opening their luggage for customs inspectors, but until now, domestic
passengers have only had to deal with searches of their carry-on
items.</LD>
<TE>   The luggage policy will be phased in as uniformed federal
passenger and baggage screeners begin staffing airport checkpoints in
force later this summer, transportation officials said. The
Transportation Security Administration screeners must meet stricter
qualifications and complete more rigorous training than did the
private guards they are replacing. The goal is more effective and
consistent security at 429 airports with regular airline service.</TE>
<TE>   At Los Angeles International Airport, the federal takeover will
begin by the first week in July with the arrival of a "site
assessment team" to begin mapping out a complex choreography that
will unfold over the next several months. An early version of the LAX
plan, displayed at a news conference here, had hundreds of
small-print line items on two sheets of paper the size of large
posters.</TE>
<TE>   "We're moving from the planning phase to action," said
Transportation Department spokesman Chet Lunner. "If this were a
sports team, opening day would be next week." The first 23 site
assessment teams will be deployed Monday to a sample of medium and
smaller airports, including Palm Springs International. Of the larger
airports, Newark and Boston will be among the first to get federal
screeners. Two of the planes hijacked in the terrorist assault of
Sept. 11 took off from Boston and one from Newark.</TE>
<TE>   Congress has set deadlines of Nov. 19 for federal screeners  to be
in place at all airports and Dec. 31 for all checked bags to be
screened with explosives detection systems.</TE>
<TE>   "There is pretty broad skepticism from a lot of people about these
deadlines," acknowledged Stephen McHale, deputy director of the new
security agency. "They are daunting."</TE>
<TE>   More than 32,000 screeners will be needed to staff passenger
checkpoints and at least another 21,500 to handle checked luggage.
McHale said he is confident the agency can have them all in place.</TE>
<TE>   The new policy for screening checked baggage is widely seen as the
organization's  most difficult challenge. Before Sept. 11, the
Federal Aviation Administration had approved a bomb screening
technology that uses computed tomography (CT) scanners to generate
three-dimensional images of objects in closed bags. But not enough of
the minivan-sized machines could be built and installed by Dec 31.</TE>
<TE>   The security agency  also decided to bring in smaller
trace-detection units, which can pick up residue left by explosives
on the outside of closed bags or amid the contents of open ones. The
operator of a trace machine wipes a cotton swab on the bag, then
places the swab into an analyzer, which sounds an alarm if a
suspicious substance is detected.</TE>
<TE>   Trace detectors are much more effective when a bag is opened, so
intrusive inspections are required to guarantee a high level of
security.</TE>
<TE>   The government is buying up to 1,100 CT scanners and 4,800 to
6,000 trace detectors. Travelers can already see both systems at
airports. Trace units are now used to check for explosives in shoes.
Many airports will employ a mix of the two technologies to screen
checked luggage.</TE>
<TE>   Some travelers will experience an extensive inspection of the
contents of their checked bags, said Randy Null,  senior advisor for
explosives detection for the security agency.</TE>
<TE>   Other travelers will be asked to open their bags, but only the
larger items inside will be swabbed for explosives residues. Some
travelers will have only the outside of their bags tested.</TE>
<TE>   "Privacy is certainly an issue," Null said. "We are looking at
different types of partitions and ways to shelter the bag and its
contents." Trace inspection might be done at curbside or during
check-in, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Stempler, the advocate for passengers, said the government should
build an automated system to screen checked bags for possible bombs.
"We're a technological nation, and we should be able to figure out
how to do this."</TE>

<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>An emergency medical technician testified Tuesday that Richard C.
Reid had slurred speech and appeared sluggish as he was questioned by
the FBI for allegedly trying to blow up a jetliner with explosives
hidden in his shoes.</LD>
<LD>   The testimony came during a hearing on Reid's request to suppress
statements made after his arrest. Reid's lawyers claim he was still
feeling the effects of Valium and sedatives that passengers forcibly
injected into him while trying to restrain him.</LD>
<LD>   Steven Solletti, an emergency medical technician, said that when
he arrived at Boston's Logan International Airport, Reid's blood
pressure was elevated and he appeared sleepy.</LD>
<TE>   "His words, they appeared to be slurred, sluggish, kind of like he
was intoxicated," Solletti said.</TE>
<TE>   But two prosecution witnesses testified that Reid did not appear
to be affected by sedatives during questioning, about eight hours
after he was injected.</TE>
<TE>   Reid, 28, a British citizen who, authorities allege, was trained
in Afghanistan by the Al Qaeda terrorist group, is accused of trying
to blow up American Airlines Flight 63 during its trip from Paris to
Miami on Dec. 22. He has pleaded not guilty to eight charges,
including attempted murder of the 197 passengers and crew members.</TE>

<HD>FBI Braces for Possibility of July 4 Attacks</HD>
<DH>Security: Intelligence indicates Independence Day
celebrations could be targeted. Authorities dismiss a report about an
Al Qaeda threat to Catalina Island.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Even as authorities played down uncorroborated reports
of an Al Qaeda attack on the Southern California coast, the FBI was
girding Tuesday for possible attacks on July 4 and canvassing major
celebrations around the country for signs of trouble.</LD>
<LD>   The FBI "is assuming a heightened security posture" because of a
rash of worrisome intelligence reports indicating that major
Independence Day celebrations could be attacked, according to a
confidential law enforcement alert reviewed by The Times.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the intelligence reports--which could stem from
interrogations of captured Al Qaeda operatives--are considered
unsubstantiated or "of unknown validity," officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the FBI is requiring each of its 56 field offices
around the country to develop plans of operation by Thursday for
monitoring all major Independence Day celebrations in their regions
and coming up with a response plan if problems develop. FBI Director
Robert S. Mueller III is expected to brief President Bush on the July
4 threat in coming days.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, the FBI has looked into, and generally dismissed,
intelligence tips about the possibility of attacks on nuclear
facilities and subways on or around July 4.</TE>
<TE>   But the alert put out by FBI headquarters on Friday to its field
offices goes far beyond previous concerns in urging agents to be
alert to possible attacks at all major Independence Day celebrations
nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Of particular concern are those in the vicinity of subways that
could be the target of biological or chemical attack, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA, which has been feuding with the FBI in recent weeks over
allegations of missed warning signs before Sept. 11, will also be
consulted about all July 4 threats in an effort to have the two
agencies share all intelligence information, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an awful lot of anxiety about the Fourth of July," said
an FBI agent who asked not to be identified. "There's not much hard
information about when or where, but people are concerned."</TE>
<TE>   Cheryl Mimura, a spokeswoman for the FBI in Los Angeles, said
local agents have already begun contacting organizers of July 4
fireworks and festivals to determine their plans for the holiday.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles office will be reporting to Washington
headquarters in coming days with what it has found and its response
plan should problems develop. Agents may staff specific events if the
need arises, but it has no plans so far to open a special command
post at any events, she said.</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials in Los Angeles said they could not discuss any
special preparations for July 4.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington alert does not specify what should be considered a
major celebration, and with thousands of Independence Day events and
fireworks displays planned nationwide for one of the biggest holidays
of the year, tracking them could prove an enormous task for the
bureau.</TE>
<TE>   But agents are being urged to focus on those high-profile events
that are likely to draw particularly large crowds, including
political leaders and celebrities, law enforcement sources said.</TE>
<TE>   By opening control files on major events, the FBI--which has been
accused of failing to connect pre-Sept. 11 warnings--would be able to
look for patterns and match new intelligence information against what
is known about July 4 celebrations, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities "want to know what's going on around the country," the
agent said. "We want to know where the substantial gatherings and
celebrations are so that if something emerges in the next three
weeks, [the FBI] can do a better job of connecting the dots."</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, the FBI has chased down leads on dozens of
potential sites, dates and methods for terrorist attacks. Authorities
have pursued leads about everything from explosive-laden scuba divers
and attacks on banks and strip malls to Tuesday's uncorroborated
report about a boatload of Al Qaeda operatives heading for Santa
Catalina Island.</TE>
<TE>   Many of these leads have been generated by interviews with
captured Al Qaeda operatives in Cuba and with senior Osama bin Laden
aide Abu Zubeida, who is thought to be in custody in or near Pakistan
since his capture in March.</TE>
<TE>   The slew of intelligence tips has stirred fears that Zubeida may
be spreading disinformation in order to send U.S. authorities down
the wrong path.</TE>
<TE>   But some of the information he has provided appears to have proved
credible, as in the apprehension of Jose Padilla, suspected of making
plans to detonate a "dirty" bomb.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say they are trying to track all leads, even at the
risk of stirring alarm among the public.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, this is part of the new reality post-9/11, and
it's something we're all still growing used to," a Justice Department
official said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the reports about a boatload of Al Qaeda operatives headed
for Catalina sent ripples of concern throughout Southern California
on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   But authorities said they believed the threat, first reported in
the Washington Times, was baseless.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think California is under attack," said the Justice
Department official, who asked not to be identified. "There is no
ship; the Coast Guard doesn't have anything in its sights."</TE>
<TE>   The tip was generated from unidentified intelligence sources, and
agents investigated it to determine its veracity, according to FBI
officials in Washington and Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "We did look into it, but at this point, the investigation has not
been able to substantiate or otherwise support the information," said
Bill Carter, an FBI spokesman in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Carter said authorities "continue to receive information from
detainees and other sources about possible acts of terrorism. We
don't ignore them, we run them out as much as we can, but in this
case the investigation has not substantiated the threat."</TE>
<TE>   The threat was never considered serious enough to consult with
senior officials at the Justice Department or other federal agencies
in Washington, officials said.</TE>

<LD>Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura came to office four years ago as a
gruff, take-no-guff anti-politician, a professional wrestler who was
determined to bring straight talk and common sense to governing. On
Tuesday, he threw in the towel.</LD>
<LD>   Worn down after a bruising legislative session, fed up with his
struggles to balance the budget--and incensed by what he saw as media
"jackals" prying into his personal life--Ventura said he will not
seek reelection in November.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement marked an abrupt political exit for the
flamboyant politician, who had made his name (actually, his
pseudonym--he was born James Janos) as a caustic talk radio announcer
and a trash-talking professional wrestler in pink tights and feather
boa.</LD>
<TE>   After his surprise victory in 1998--propelled by record turnout,
especially among young men and first-time voters--Ventura sparked so
much excitement that he was frequently mentioned as a possible future
presidential candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Known by his wrestling nickname, "The Body," he also had to be the
only state executive in the nation who inspired action figure toys
and T-shirts emblazoned with "My Governor Can Beat Up Your Governor."
(Even today, Ventura souvenirs remain hot sellers. One fan Web site
reports that its online store is temporarily closed because "our
entire supply of Jesse Ventura Bobbleheads sold out in two days.")</TE>
<TE>   Ventura, 50, achieved a number of his goals as governor, such as
launching a light-rail transportation project and overhauling the tax
code. With his knack for in-your-face, polls-be-damned comments, he
also dominated political discourse in the state.</TE>
<TE>   But his popularity--and his enthusiasm for public life--dimmed in
the past year, as Minnesota's economy sagged and as the budget crisis
turned into a nasty and protracted political battle.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura also chafed at the relentless media coverage of his
family--including, most recently, reports this week that his son had
thrown wild parties that left the governor's mansion trashed.</TE>
<TE>   "His heart was not in it," said Dean Barkley, who chaired
Ventura's 1998 campaign and now serves the governor as director of
planning. "I think he just got tired of being the person battling the
political system."</TE>
<TE>   Added political scientist Craig Grau: "He never built a party that
could compete in legislative elections. So there was no one there to
support him."</TE>
<TE>   From the start, Ventura made it clear he was going to be a
different kind of governor. He told reporters early on that he
expected to work on state business from 9 to 5 on weekdays, leaving
plenty of time for his own ventures. Those activities ended up
attracting almost as much media attention as his policies. Ventura
took tremendous flak for working as a television commentator for the
now-defunct XFL football league, for moonlighting as a referee at
professional wrestling matches and for spending state money on his
book tour.</TE>
<TE>   He was skewered as well for mysteriously disappearing from the
state for two days just as it became clear that the Minnesota Twins
were in danger of being eliminated. (It turned out he was in Los
Angeles, shooting a film with Dana Carvey; the Twins are still
playing in Minnesota.)</TE>
<TE>   A recent Minneapolis Star-Tribune poll found that Ventura's
approval rating, which once peaked above 70%, had fallen to 43%.</TE>
<TE>   Observers said it was not so much Ventura's antics that did him in
as his inability to end the partisan bickering of politics as usual.</TE>
<TE>   "We elected someone to make a difference and he didn't really make
much of a difference," said Cedric Scofield, who worked on Ventura's
1998 campaign but split with him when the governor left the Reform
Party to form the Independence Party.</TE>
<TE>   Political analyst Harry Boyte suggested that Ventura galvanized
support during his campaign and in his first few years in office with
a populist call for citizens to get involved in civic affairs, to
stick their necks out to make a difference. But that call to action
faded this past year as Ventura struggled with the budget deficit and
other statehouse fights.</TE>
<TE>   All that was left of the old populist Ventura was his gleeful
bashing of the very "career politicians" he had to work with in the
Legislature. The legislators certainly resented the rhetoric. And
some analysts suggested it was starting to wear thin among voters as
well.</TE>
<TE>   "People saw with the budget fight this session that bashing
politicians feels good, but it doesn't make for effective government,
especially in times of crisis and turmoil," said Boyte, a senior
fellow at the Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Political Affairs at
the University of Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of [Ventura's political alienation this session] was that
legislators simply got tired of being considered crass politicians
and having the dictates come down from the mountains of the
governor's office," added Bill Morris, a political scientist at
Augsburg College in Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura came to politics after a varied career that also included
stints as a Navy SEAL and a movie actor. His political experience was
limited to five years as mayor of a Minneapolis suburb when he won
the three-way race for governor with 37% of the vote. He didn't know
some basic things about his role as the state's chief executive--not
realizing, for instance, that he was responsible for selecting some
judges. And he made some much-derided gaffes, such as his suggestion
that his wife get paid for her role as the state's first lady.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Ventura quickly surrounded himself with a seasoned and
talented staff from both parties. And he delved into governing with
his trademark zeal, starting with the bellowing "Hooo-Yaaaa" he let
fly after his inaugural speech.</TE>
<TE>   His agenda blended liberal social positions--such as support for
gay rights--with an urgent call to cut taxes and rein in government
spending. For the first three years of his reign, until the economy
soured, he was able to send out refunds--dubbed "Jesse Checks"--to
state taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   He also managed to offend just about every constituent group with
his blunt talk and his tell-all books. He told Playboy that organized
religion was "a sham and a crutch for weak-minded people." He joked
that drunken Irishmen must have laid out St. Paul's crooked streets.
He even boasted that, in Navy SEAL tradition, he regarded underwear
as superfluous.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, in February 2001, 41% of those polled by the St.
Paul Pioneer Press said they considered their governor "an
embarrassment to the state." Still, in that same poll, 59% deemed him
"a breath of fresh air."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura's road to reelection grew more difficult recently as each
of the state's two major parties chose the more centrist contender in
battles for their gubernatorial nominations. The Democrats selected
Roger Moe, the leader of the state Senate, and the Republicans picked
state House Majority Leader Tim Pawlenty.</TE>
<TE>   But many analysts believed Ventura would have remained a
formidable candidate if he had sought reelection.</TE>
<TE>   "I still think he had an excellent chance. He could have come
right up the middle and played the anti-politician," Morris said.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, however, Ventura said he didn't have the passion for
another run. Though he has made his persona as a tough guy--taking as
his motto his famous film line "I ain't got time to bleed"--he said
he did not want to spend another four years fending off personal
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult to do these public service jobs when you know your
family could be assassinated by the media at any point, deservedly or
undeservedly," he said on Minnesota Public Radio.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura did not say what he will do next; his only announced plan
is to take a summertime trip down the Mississippi River on a
Minnesota-built jet ski.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm kind of like Che Guevara," he said. "I lead the revolution,
but at some point I turn it over to someone else."</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear, though, who is in line to take over. And that may be
Ventura's biggest failing, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The Independence Party that he founded has not succeeded in
recruiting many candidates for local or statewide office. The Reform
Party has been equally ineffective. And Ventura's personality has
overshadowed some of the key issues that motivated many third-party
voters, such as campaign-finance reform.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm afraid [Ventura] might have done more harm than good because
[his performance as governor] dampened the spirits of people who were
enthusiastic about third-party candidates," Scofield said. "I don't
see much of substance that he accomplished."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura has hinted that he would like to recruit one of his
advisors, former Democratic Rep. Tim Penny, to run for governor as an
independent.</TE>
<TE>   Penny, however, has told local reporters that the chances of his
running were "very slim." Ventura's lieutenant governor, former
teacher Mae Schunk, also is unlikely to run.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is a huge challenge for the third party movement ...
whether we can build on this four-year experiment and keep it going
or not," said Barkley. "This is a do or die election for our party."</TE>

<LD>Imagine riding to work in a vehicle that will turn more heads than a
Lamborghini, outmaneuver a Porsche, cost less than a Honda Civic, go
zero to 60 faster than a BMW and get two to three times the gas
mileage of a Toyota Prius hybrid.</LD>
<LD>   Although it may be hard to believe, such a vehicle was developed
20 years ago by the big auto makers. But don't expect to be able to
drive one anytime soon.</LD>
<LD>   During the oil crisis of the 1970s and early '80s, auto makers
began exploring radically different vehicles with greatly enhanced
fuel economy. With more than 90% of commuters driving alone, they
recognized that a vehicle designed for only one or two people could
be much more efficient.</LD>
<TE>   What they came up with was the three-wheel vehicle. By eliminating
one wheel, the vehicle could be made much lighter and have
significantly less friction and much lower drag.</TE>
<TE>   The major problem was the instability of three wheels. They solved
that problem by making the vehicle lean like a motorcycle--which also
made it a blast to drive. And because the body was designed like a
crash helmet, it could be made very safe.</TE>
<TE>   But the oil crisis faded, SUVs became all the rage and the lower
profit margin of "tilting three-wheelers," or TTWs, meant the vehicle
never went into production.</TE>
<TE>   Fast-forward 20 years: Global warming has arrived, there is
renewed conflict in the Middle East, oil drilling is proposed in our
national parks and air pollution is so severe that some regions of
California are badly out of compliance with the Clean Air Act and may
lose billions of dollars in federal highway funds. This would seem to
be a great time to reassess a vehicle that is a "green" alternative.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the natural advocates of TTWs--the environmental community--do
not have this eco-friendly vehicle on their agenda. Instead,
environmental groups have poured their energies into the electric
vehicle, the 80-mile-per-gallon family sedan and the
fuel-cell-powered car. Although these are worthy pursuits, there is a
growing realization that they are long-term visions and not
immediate, practical alternatives. The makers of the fuel-cell
vehicle, for example, say it will be 10 to 20 years before they can
produce a commercially viable car. One would think, then, that
three-wheel vehicles would be something that the auto companies might
reconsider. No such luck. SUVs are more profitable than
three-wheelers.</TE>
<TE>   State officials involved in long-range transportation planning
should logically be TTW fans. Unfortunately, these officials haven't
given much consideration to TTWs. They are nowhere to be found in the
California Energy Commission's 20-year blueprint on transportation
strategies to reduce petroleum use, a document submitted to the state
Legislature. Neither are they found in a similar report by the
California Air Resources Board. And it is not because the report
writers don't know about them.</TE>
<TE>   What is more troubling is that the state and federal governments
have given the large auto companies hundreds of millions of dollars
to develop green four-wheel vehicles, yet they have given almost
nothing to several companies interested in producing the more
efficient three-wheel vehicles, including Corbin Motors, a
manufacturer based in Hollister, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   If a major goal is to reduce fossil fuel use, why would the
government give cash incentives for the 45-mpg Prius hybrid but not
for 90- to 140-mpg three-wheel vehicles?</TE>
<TE>   This is not about being envious of the Prius. It is about being
able to take a different path to the future--a road that was paved 20
years ago. Unfortunately, it has yet to be traveled.</TE>

<HD>A Paradoxical Planet Beckons and Perplexes</HD>
<DH>Lure of finding life on Mars is irresistible.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>OLIVER MORTON</AU>
<BD>Oliver Morton is a contributing editor at Wired
magazine. His book "Mapping Mars: Science, Imagination, and the Birth
of a World" is to be published in September by Picador.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To find a Great Lake's worth of water frozen just beneath the arid
surface of Mars may seem surprising. But Mars is a planet of
contradictions, a great optical illusion that always manages to be at
least two mutually exclusive things at once.</LD>
<LD>   The first great contradiction, highlighted by the results now in
from NASA's Mars Odyssey mission, is between the wet and the dry.
There is scarcely enough water in Mars' thin atmosphere to fill a
city's swimming pools. And yet its surface has been scarred by floods
more prodigious than any on Earth. Many of its craters seem to have
been filled with lakes or seas at some time. There are features
around its northern plains that some scientists interpret as the
shorelines of an ocean. Where has all that water gone? The ice layer
discovered in the planet's high latitudes may be some of the answer,
but it has been detected only near the surface. Can there really be
an ocean's worth beneath?</LD>
<TE>   Second contradiction: the new and the old. All the ice discovered
by Mars Odyssey cannot have been where it is for very long. We know
that Mars wobbles on its axis and that sometimes those wobbles result
in the areas where the ice now sits being warmed up and the ice
released as vapor. So water does not just exist on Mars, it also
circulates. Circulating water erodes things, even if it circulates
only slowly and intermittently. And yet vast tracts of the Martian
surface seem to have lasted without erosion for billions of years.
How can Mars be active and yet so well preserved?</TE>
<TE>   One thing that the ice does seem to confirm is that Mars is a
place where people might live. Mars boasts sources of water (and thus
of hydrogen and oxygen), carbon and nitrogen, the basic building
blocks of life. It enjoys days similar in length to those of the
Earth and receives enough sunlight for plants to photosynthesize.
Mars is thus the only planet or moon in the solar system that one can
imagine as humanity's second home.</TE>
<TE>   And yet Mars is a horrible place. Its atmosphere is as thin as our
stratosphere and devoid of oxygen. Its surface is colder than
Antarctica and bathed in radiation. Its soil is laced with what seems
to be bleach, and its all-pervading dust may carry enough heavy
metals to make the whole planet a Superfund site. Mars is the most
Earth-like of the other planets and at the same time hostile and
alien beyond our comprehension.</TE>
<TE>   One form of earthliness, though, inspires scientists' dreams:
life. If there are to be human expeditions to Mars, the driving goal
will be to look for life in places that robots can't reach.</TE>
<TE>   But the better the odds on Martian life become, the harder human
exploration will be. Studying an alien ecosystem that could be very
fragile, or dangerous to humans, without contamination in either
direction is something that we have no idea how to do. The National
Academy of Sciences has advised NASA that humans should go only to
parts of Mars that have been certified thoroughly lifeless. Any
landing site for humans will be meticulously scouted out by robots
before a crew touches down; no one will ever climb to the top of a
Martian hill without already knowing what lies on the other side.</TE>
<TE>   But that does not make climbing to the top pointless. To know of
somewhere and to be there are not the same. And the difference would
be felt by everyone watching and sharing the astronauts' progress
across the far-off desert in the sky. The happiest contradiction Mars
offers is the chance for the farthest-flung humans in history to be,
for a while, at the center of our world.</TE>

<HD>Behind 'Plot' on Hussein, a Secret Agenda</HD>
<DH>Killing weapons inspections would clear way for war.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT RITTER</AU>
<BD>Scott Ritter, a former U.N. weapons inspector in Iraq,
is author of "Endgame: Solving the Iraq Problem, Once and for All"
(Simon &amp; Schuster, 1999).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush has reportedly authorized the CIA to use all of the
means at its disposal--including U.S. military special operations
forces and CIA paramilitary teams--to eliminate Iraq's Saddam
Hussein. According to reports, the CIA is to view any such plan as
"preparatory" for a larger military strike.</LD>
<LD>   Congressional leaders from both parties have greeted these reports
with enthusiasm. In their rush to be seen as embracing the
president's hard-line stance on Iraq, however, almost no one in
Congress has questioned why a supposedly covert operation would be
made public, thus undermining the very mission it was intended to
accomplish.</LD>
<LD>   It is high time that Congress start questioning the hype and
rhetoric emanating from the White House regarding Baghdad, because
the leaked CIA plan is well timed to undermine the efforts underway
in the United Nations to get weapons inspectors back to work in Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   In early July, the U.N. secretary-general will meet with Iraq's
foreign minister for a third round of talks on the return of the
weapons monitors. A major sticking point is Iraqi concern over the
use--or abuse--of such inspections by the U.S. for intelligence
collection.</TE>
<TE>   I recall during my time as a chief inspector in Iraq the dozens of
extremely fit "missile experts" and "logistics specialists" who
frequented my inspection teams and others. Drawn from U.S. units such
as Delta Force or from CIA paramilitary teams such as the Special
Activities Staff (both of which have an ongoing role in the conflict
in Afghanistan), these specialists had a legitimate part to play in
the difficult cat-and-mouse effort to disarm Iraq. So did the teams
of British radio intercept operators I ran in Iraq from 1996 to
1998--which listened in on the conversations of Hussein's inner
circle--and the various other intelligence specialists who were part
of the inspection effort.</TE>
<TE>   The presence of such personnel on inspection teams was, and is,
viewed by the Iraqi government as an unacceptable risk to its
nation's security.</TE>
<TE>   As early as 1992, the Iraqis viewed the teams I led inside Iraq as
a threat to the safety of their president. They were concerned that
my inspections were nothing more than a front for a larger effort to
eliminate their leader.</TE>
<TE>   Those concerns were largely baseless while I was in Iraq. Now that
Bush has specifically authorized American covert-operations forces to
remove Hussein, however, the Iraqis will never trust an inspection
regime that has already shown itself susceptible to infiltration and
manipulation by intelligence services hostile to Iraq, regardless of
any assurances the U.N. secretary-general might give.</TE>
<TE>   The leaked CIA covert operations plan effectively kills any chance
of inspectors returning to Iraq, and it closes the door on the last
opportunity for shedding light on the true state of affairs regarding
any threat in the form of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Absent any return of weapons inspectors, no one seems willing to
challenge the Bush administration's assertions of an Iraqi threat. If
Bush has a factual case against Iraq concerning weapons of mass
destruction, he hasn't made it yet.</TE>
<TE>   Can the Bush administration substantiate any of its claims that
Iraq continues to pursue efforts to reacquire its capability to
produce chemical and biological weapons, which was dismantled and
destroyed by U.N. weapons inspectors from 1991 to 1998? The same
question applies to nuclear weapons. What facts show that Iraq
continues to pursue nuclear weapons aspirations?</TE>
<TE>   Bush spoke ominously of an Iraqi ballistic missile threat to
Europe. What missile threat is the president talking about? These
questions are valid, and if the case for war is to be made, they must
be answered with more than speculative rhetoric.</TE>
<TE>   Congress has seemed unwilling to challenge the Bush
administration's pursuit of war against Iraq. The one roadblock to an
all-out U.S. assault would be weapons inspectors reporting on the
facts inside Iraq. Yet without any meaningful discussion and debate
by Congress concerning the nature of the threat posed by Baghdad, war
seems all but inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   The true target of the supposed CIA plan may not be Hussein but
rather the weapons inspection program itself. The real casualty is
the last chance to avoid bloody conflict.</TE>

<HD>Build Palestinian Hope, Build Israeli Confidence</HD>
<DH>A timeline for creating a state must be linked to ending
terrorism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS ROSS</AU>
<BD>Dennis Ross, director of the Washington Institute for
Near East Policy, is a former U.S. envoy to the Middle East.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush, having concluded his consultations with Middle
Eastern leaders, now appears poised to make a statement about what is
necessary to create the path to peace. Bush has heard very different
prescriptions for what is necessary. While the specifics on the Arab
side may vary, the essence of what the president has heard from
Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, King Abdullah of Jordan and
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt is that the Palestinians need hope.
They need to know that the Israeli occupation will end, that there
will be a Palestinian state and that there will be a specific
timeline that spells out when this will happen. Only under such
circumstances, they argue, will it be possible to get the
Palestinians to stop the terror and violence.</LD>
<LD>   From Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel, the president heard a
very different message: The violence must stop first. Reform is
necessary to bypass Yasser Arafat and to ensure that any halt to
terrorism is not temporary; only then will a real political process
be possible. To spell out the political outcome now based on
far-reaching concessions by Israel will only confirm that violence
works and terror pays--a prescription for neither peace nor security.</LD>
<TE>   Can Bush reconcile these two conflicting perspectives? Perhaps,
but to do so he will have to build on the areas where there is
already consensus, and he will have to be prepared to offer American
ideas in those areas where no ideas now exist. In the first instance,
there is general consensus on several points: There should be
fundamental reform of the Palestinian Authority. The violence should
stop. And peace ultimately will require two states--Israel and
Palestine--living side by side with secure and recognized borders.</TE>
<TE>   For the Arabs, the concept of a timeline with a credible end point
is important. For the Israelis, the concept of performance,
especially to prove that the Palestinians will fulfill their
obligations, is their central preoccupation.</TE>
<TE>   The obvious bridge between the two is a timeline based on
performance. In practical terms that would integrate security
obligations, reform requirements, confidence-building steps and
political developments--including statehood and negotiations with
broad guidelines to resolve the issues of Jerusalem, borders and
refugees.</TE>
<TE>   This timeline would spell out what is required in the first six
months (security, reform, mutual confidence-building); when the
Palestinian state could be recognized (one year); and when even the
most thorny issues should be resolved (three years).</TE>
<TE>   But the developments on the timeline would not be automatic. A
timeline based on performance means obligations must be fulfilled if
the timeline is to unfold as designed. For the Palestinians that
would mean that the clock stops if they do not fulfill their
obligations. It would not resume until there was unequivocal
performance.</TE>
<TE>   In reality, that could mean the clock on the timeline would be
stopped for a long period. On the other hand, if the Palestinians are
performing and the Israelis are not, the clock as it relates to
important political developments (e.g., statehood) for the
Palestinians could be accelerated.</TE>
<TE>   In presenting an integrated timeline based on performance, Bush
would be responding to the interests and concerns expressed by both
sides. But he cannot present this timeline without putting it in
context. That context must take account of the importance of peace
and the need to end the suffering of both sides. That context must
also take account of how we arrived at this point. While some will
counsel not dredging up the uncomfortable realities of the past,
particularly as we try to look forward, no plan has any chance of
working if it does not engage in truth-telling.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever mistakes the Israelis have made in failing to be
sufficiently sensitive to the Palestinian need for independence and
freedom from Israeli control, the historical failing has been
Arafat's.</TE>
<TE>   He had an opportunity to end the conflict that he refused to
seize. Worse, notwithstanding his commitment to renounce violence as
part of the Oslo process, he continued to regard terror as an
instrument of Palestinian policy.</TE>
<TE>   That must end--unmistakably, unequivocally and demonstrably. Both
sides will have to adjust to reality. But Palestinians must be ready
to acknowledge that terror and violence only destroy their cause, not
serve it. They must be prepared to prove this in their actions. For a
president who has made the war on terrorism the standard by which to
judge himself, it is inconceivable that he would not require this to
be the first step on the timeline of responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   I say this not simply because of Bush's credibility or Israeli
needs but because any plan or any idea--no matter how good--could be
overwhelmed by violence. In an atmosphere where the terror persists,
the Israelis will continue their daily incursions into Palestinian
cities and refugee camps to try to stop those who would kill
Israelis. They will continue to tighten the grip on Palestinian towns
and villages, making normal life, political processes and commerce
impossible--but also making it far harder for those planning,
recruiting and organizing terror to carry out their murderous acts.</TE>
<TE>   There may be no definitive Israeli military answer to Palestinian
terrorism, but there will be no political answer to Palestinian
aspirations without an end to the violence.</TE>
<TE>   It is an illusion to believe there will be a peace process so long
as the Palestinian Authority makes no effort to stop acts of terror.
It is an illusion to think that reform is possible or meaningful in
an environment in which terrorism remains legitimate for the
Palestinian leadership.</TE>
<TE>   And it is an illusion to think that a Palestinian state can emerge
before the Palestinian leadership makes it clear that there will be
only one authority; indeed, before it acts to demonstrate that
multiple militias such as Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the Al Aqsa
Martyrs Brigade--with their own agendas, their own weapons and their
own capacity to attack Israelis--will not be tolerated.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians as a people need hope. They need to know that the
pathway to achieving their aspirations exists, and they need to see
that it is credible. But they also need to know that their state in
waiting and their freedom from Israeli control cannot become reality
until their leadership demonstrates its readiness to fulfill its
responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   Without that fundamental prerequisite, no plan or timeline stands
any chance of success.</TE>

<LD>The rich get richer and the poor get poorer all over California. Not
just individuals or families this time, but cities, suburbs, rural
counties and entire regions, as coveted sales tax dollars gravitate
to newly wealthy places such as Roseville, a former railroad town
near Sacramento. With their glitzy shopping malls and vast auto sales
plazas, these communities flourish. Nearby towns whose retail centers
were the latest thing in the 1960s and 1970s stagnate, their stores
empty and dark.</LD>
<LD>   When a local government grabs a Costco or an auto mall, it also
lands a bounty of sales tax money, often creating a have-not
community next door. Suddenly, these older areas can't afford the
services and infrastructure that keep communities vibrant.</LD>
<LD>   Until now, California lawmakers have seemed incapable of grappling
with the distortions created by the 1% of the sales tax that is
returned to the local government where the sales occurred. But today
the Senate Local Government Committee can begin to repair that
flaw--and redeem the Legislature--by approving AB 680, by Assemblyman
Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento).</LD>
<TE>   The bill provides for the regionwide sharing--on a trial basis in
the Sacramento area only--of any growth in sales tax revenues
beginning in 2004. A third of the new sales tax receipts would go
back to the locale of the sales. Another third would be distributed
within the region on a population basis. The rest would be used to
reward cities and counties that lived up to their commitment to build
low- and medium-income housing.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the League of California Cities and individual
cities from Mission Viejo to San Mateo--affluent ones more often than
not--oppose the bill because they fear that if the program works in
Sacramento they too may get stuck with it.</TE>
<TE>   This self-centered arrogance ignores the likelihood that today's
affluence will someday migrate, leaving behind seedy malls and
lagging tax income. These towns should get over themselves and
recognize that ultimately they stand to benefit from Steinberg's
proposed experiment.</TE>

<LD>Big bucks can buy a lot of political power, which is good reason to
keep a close watch on any political campaign. That includes the
crusade preceding the Nov. 5 vote on breaking up Los Angeles. But
please, no sanctimonious sniping by leaders of the San Fernando
Valley secession movement about Mayor James K. Hahn's fund-raising.
The chief secession organization, Valley VOTE, for years has refused
to even identify its financial backers.</LD>
<LD>   According to Monday's Times, Hahn has been asking companies and
lobbyists who deal with the city to make large contributions to the
campaign, known as L.A. United, that is opposing Valley and Hollywood
secession. Playing the role of pot to Hahn's kettle, Richard Katz, a
Valley VOTE board member and head of its spinoff fund-raising
committee, said that for the mayor to request such big sums "sure
raises questions about propriety." Look to yourself, Mr. Katz.</LD>
<TE>   Like most political fund-raising, Hahn's solicitations have
obvious quid pro quo potential for anyone wanting to do business in
or with Los Angeles. It was precisely to thwart mutual
back-scratching that city voters elected to rein in runaway spending
and thus dilute the influence of special interests. Unfortunately,
city and state campaign reformers never anticipated secession.
Contribution and spending limits don't apply to campaigns for or
against a city breakup or to the campaigns for Valley and Hollywood
mayor and city council that will be waged simultaneously.</TE>
<TE>   However fat its contributions, the L.A. United campaign is at
least complying with disclosure rules. The next report is due in
July.</TE>
<TE>   Public reporting of donors, donations and spending has been
central to campaign reform nationwide since Watergate. Katz, however,
told The Times that his fund-raising committee technically was not
required to say who its backers were until the county Board of
Supervisors officially voted to put secession on the ballot, never
mind that everyone knows it will do so.</TE>
<TE>   That vote is scheduled Aug. 6, conveniently just past the July 30
deadline for disclosing fund-raising and spending during the first
half of the year. The next deadline is Oct. 5, a mere month before
the election.</TE>
<TE>   Another avenue to the same goal exists. At the urging of ethics
watchdogs, the state Legislature two years ago gave the government
body overseeing secession, the Local Agency Formation Commission, the
power to require disclosure. The commissioners, many of them
sympathetic to Valley VOTE, have not done so.</TE>
<TE>   Secrecy is nothing new to Valley VOTE. Since launching its 1998
petition drive, it has withheld the names of all but a handful of its
financial backers: auto dealer Burt Boeckmann, lawyer David Fleming
and the Los Angeles Daily News.</TE>
<TE>   Secession advocates have promised voters a more open, accountable
and responsive city government in the Valley. Their record portends
the opposite.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The seven members of the Los Angeles Board of Education and schools
Supt. Roy Romer evidently need a refresher course on the power of
political symbolism. Their dulled and shrugging response to the
construction of personal restrooms for each of them--at a time when
the students they claim to represent go without--is stunning in its
cluelessness.</LD>
<LD>   To use a teacher's classroom phrase, think of this as a lesson in
compare and contrast.</LD>
<LD>   Here's what the students at Bethune Middle School in South Los
Angeles get: holes in the wall where fixtures had been, no toilet
paper, no soap, no paper towels and no doors on the stalls. And
here's what the kids at Palms Middle School get: graffiti, scratched
toilets, protruding, rusted, broken fixtures and grimy floors. And
the fun doesn't end there. At Venice High School, graffiti may have
been painted over in a student restroom but that did nothing to
lessen the overpowering stench of waste in clogged toilets.</LD>
<TE>   And here's what the school board members and the superintendent
will get: individual, brand-spanking-new, clean and functioning
restrooms at the district's new headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   We're certainly not suggesting that it would be right for the
board and Romer to have to endure what students must put up with
every day. But did the disconnection between the services supplied to
children and those provided to administrators give pause to no one in
Los Angeles Unified School District management?</TE>
<TE>   Everybody does it, said board President Caprice Young, pointing to
other politicians with personal bathrooms. She says that it would
have been micromanagement for the board to look at the small-time
$100,000 expenditure for restrooms. And the restrooms aren't
luxurious. After all, Romer added, they don't have showers!</TE>
<TE>   The LAUSD promised better restrooms for students in 2000 when the
district began operating a Clean Bathroom Hotline. The number, (800)
495-1191, still works. The complaints are said to get priority. Given
what our quick survey turned up, that's hard to believe.</TE>
<TE>   The district, reacting to statewide budget woes, is cutting the
schools' budgets severely. Jobs for custodians who would clean up the
messes in the student lavatories are being jettisoned. Yet, somehow,
the individual restrooms for the board and Romer remain in the
budget, untouched by the harsh realities that affect others.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that the $100,000 could make the challenges of the school
district disappear. But the tin political ear of the district
continues to astound. In politics, symbols matter. That $100,000,
we'd bet, would have bought a lot of functioning toilets and paper
towels. For the students. You know, the people in the classrooms for
whom the LAUSD supposedly exists.</TE>

<LD>Israel is finally recognizing that it is impossible for it to
negotiate with the Palestinian Authority ("Israel Gives In to Fence,"
June 17). But building fences is not enough. It's time for Israel to
dismantle its settlements and give up the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
but not to the Palestinians. Instead, give the West Bank back to
Jordan and Gaza back to Egypt, which kept the Palestinians without
statehood for the 19 years before Israel's occupation.</LD>

<LD>Re "Hussein Ouster Is Backed," June 17: What the world needs now is
another Central Interference Agency coup to bring down the leader of
Iraq. Let's review the "successes" of the CIA.</LD>
<LD>   The people of Iran once elected Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh,
but we didn't like him so he had to go. This brought back the shah,
who so enraged Iranians he had to flee the country, and the Ayatollah
Khomeini took over. We now have wonderful relations with Iran.
Because former President Carter let the shah into this country for
cancer treatment, our embassy was taken over and our people there
were subjected to days and days at the mercy of Iranians who hated
the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   I understand there is a psychological one-upmanship battle between
fathers and sons, which is harmless if you are not the president.
Perhaps George W. feels we don't have enough enemies in the region.
He's going to show Iraq who's top gun--at the expense of many, many
others.</LD>

<TE>   While a bipartisan group in Congress supports the Bush
administration's call for the ouster of Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, an even more convincing group of military leaders,
apparently including Colin Powell, opposes an American military
attack against Iraq. As long as the U.S. government follows legal and
nonmilitary approaches to encouraging political alternatives in
countries ruled by broadly vilified regimes, we are not likely to
incur the hatred of militant political groups. But the use of force
and the presence of American troops on foreign soil--especially in
the Middle East--can only lead to more Sept. 11s.</TE>

<TE>   Isn't President Bush carrying openness in government much too far,
ordering the CIA to do away with Hussein and letting the order go
public? Come on! This is the kind of thing that is done covertly.</TE>

<TE>   The key members of the Bush team, including Vice President Dick
Cheney, spent Father's Day weekend in Washington hammering out a
proposal for an interim Palestinian state (June 17).</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, "President" Bush, with his 70% war-on-terror-driven
approval rating, spent the weekend hiking and doing yardwork at his
ranch in Texas. Can any clear-thinking American really believe that
Bush has any significant involvement in his own administration, or
that he really deserves the high approval ratings he enjoys?</TE>

<TE>   On June 14, Ohio State graduates were threatened with expulsion
if, God forbid, they chose to protest a speech by Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Citizens are arrested and held without the benefit of due process.
Senior government officials orchestrate a campaign intended to create
an atmosphere of fear in America. Right-wing zealots are appointed to
sensitive positions throughout the government.</TE>
<TE>   This is the America of Bush. Or is it Francisco Franco? They are
of the same frightening character. When will we wake up to the
reality that our precious nation has become a police state, with no
end in sight?</TE>

<TE>   The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which has served us so well for
30 years, was abrogated on June 13. This is clearly unconstitutional.
Treaties are passed with the advice and consent of the Senate.
Therefore, what right does a president have to abrogate such a treaty
with no debate and no consent?</TE>
<TE>   A group in Congress is suing to get Bush's decree ruled
unconstitutional. The Bush administration seems to have a "Father
Knows Best" attitude that permits its members to determine policy
with no input from the people or from the Congress. This is
democracy?</TE>

<LD>Re "Football Stadium Plan Withdrawn," June 15: If Chicago can call
itself "The City That Works," then L.A. can call itself "A City of
Special Interests That Bicker Constantly Instead of Getting the Job
Done." Over the past year I've seen more political infighting than I
can possibly stand. What makes this so infuriating is that the city
and its people suffer.</LD>
<LD>   The L.A. City Council is bickering with the Los Angeles Convention
&amp; Visitors Bureau over the convention center business. The county is
bickering with the city over a downtown redevelopment plan. The
Valley wants to secede. Hollywood wants to secede. With Supervisor
Zev Yaroslavsky on the county board it doesn't seem as if our transit
system will ever get completed, a stadium built or our downtown
revitalized.</LD>
<LD>   Why is the county bickering with the Anschutz Entertainment Group
over a downtown stadium plan (which ultimately killed the project)?
Hello, Coliseum, are you listening? The NFL said, "No." Arrrrggghhh!</LD>
<TE>   Nix our city-county government and give someone the reins. We need
a Rudolph Giuliani, a Richard Daley. We need leadership--now!</TE>
<TE>   Tony Hoover</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So, Philip Anschutz and team appear to punt on third down. Is it a
bluff, a razzle-dazzle end-around play to scare the city into going
along with their plan? Mayor James Hahn seems to think so, but let's
hope he is wrong. Opponents of the sugarcoated "no public funds
involved" plan are right to be wary. First, using eminent domain to
corral property needed for the stadium is a dubious use of that
government prerogative at best. Second, floating a huge municipal
bond issue to help finance the project is providing public funds, no
matter how the pro-stadium advocates claim that it would be paid back
via ticket and sales taxes. Bettors call that "betting on the
if-come," always a dangerous venture.</TE>
<TE>   Look who is clamoring for an NFL franchise: politicians who regard
it as an ego-stroking prestige factor, Anschutz and associates who
stand to make big bucks, wealthy corporations and individuals who can
write off the cost of elaborate luxury boxes (escaping taxes lesser
mortals must pay) and a faction of sports fanatics, most of whom will
be lucky if they can afford to attend one game per season. Meanwhile,
average fans won't even be able to watch home games on TV. Blackouts,
you know.</TE>

<TE>   Thank you, Tim Leiweke and the AEG, for publicly announcing now
that you are going to pick up your marbles and go home to Denver.
Nothing could be better to hear. The people of Los Angeles don't need
to fatten the coffers of the Anschutz group through the building of
an NFL-style stadium just blocks away from our existing landmark, the
Los Angeles Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL has not publicly stated in the last 10 years that it would
like to be in Los Angeles, so let it woo us for a while. Let's play
pro football again in a remodeled and updated Coliseum, which is the
sports landmark and icon of Los Angeles. Let the AEG choke on the
downtown land it owns and let the fat-cat NFL owners go dictate to
some other city.</TE>

<LD>Thank you for your June 16 article "Jail Suicides Reach Record Pace
in State." As usual, The Times is at the forefront identifying and
highlighting growing problems before others recognize their
existence. The Times' editorials supporting AB 1421 offer a solution
to at least one, and probably many other, suicide cases.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of releasing Joshua Daniel Lee to continue his slide into
severe psychosis, if court-mandated, assisted-outpatient treatment
(AB 1421) were available and utilized, his death, his alleged
victim's death and many other preventable deaths might have been
avoided. Thank you for your continued concern for the large number of
people with mental illness in jail or prison.</LD>

<LD>Re "Andersen Found Guilty of Obstruction," June 16: I was appalled at
the statement made by Houston attorney David Berg that "if you can't
win a conviction in an hour in Harris County, Texas, where Andersen
and Enron teamed up to hurt a lot of people, you've got problems."
This attitude is antiquated in a society packed with civil rights and
appeals laws and is disparaging to the members of the jury, who tried
to be fair and unbiased in their service. As shown in a related
article, "Deliberations Came Down to a Single Memo," the Andersen
jury took great pains to sort out the plethora of evidence in the
trial.</LD>
<LD>   Obviously, the 12 men and women approached their civic duties with
open minds and labored extensively to reach a unanimous verdict.
Kudos to these jurors, who decided not to be ruled by their emotions
but instead looked at the evidence in an unbiased manner. Would that
all prospective jurors (myself included) commit to that level of
dedication when called upon to perform their civic duties.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Paper Trail Points to Roots of Energy Crisis," June 16:</TE>
<TE>   Let me see if I've got this straight. Former presidential hopeful
Ross "Let's Look Under the Hood" Perot's company was selling the
programs to engage in "gaming" California's electrical supply. (He's
now unavailable for comment.) The boys down at Arthur Andersen were
shredding evidence in the investigation into Enron's collapse. At the
same time, the boys down on Wall Street were advising their clients
to buy (when they and their well-heeled power brokers were selling).</TE>
<TE>   Now the boys down at the Pentagon want to seal further testing on
the missile defense program from public scrutiny ("Missile Data to Be
Kept Secret," June 9). We have more than an energy crisis on our
hands. We are being forced to play games that really aren't that much
fun.</TE>

<HD>INS Deadline Nears for Hondurans, Nicaraguans in Southland</HD>
<DH>Immigrants: Thousands got legal status due to hurricane
damage back home. But they must reapply by July 2.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY McCARTNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thousands of Honduran and Nicaraguan citizens living in Southern
California have less than two weeks to extend their temporary legal
status.</LD>
<LD>   The Immigration and Naturalization Service granted them "temporary
protected status" after Hurricane Mitch ravaged Central America in
1998, ruining croplands and killing thousands.</LD>
<LD>   That status would have expired July 5. But in May, the INS
extended it one year, but only for those who reapply by July 2.</LD>
<TE>   About 80,000 people nationwide qualify for protected status,
although only about 10,000 have re-registered, said Francisco
Arcaute, an INS spokesman in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Local advocacy groups are concerned that many eligible residents
will wait too long to renew their protected status applications.
Those who never applied also have until July 2 to do so. All
applicants must show that they have lived in the United States since
Jan. 5, 1999.</TE>
<TE>   When first offered, the Central American Resource Center helped
500 applicants get protected status, said Legal Director Robert Foss.
But many haven't responded to the reminders the center mailed out.</TE>
<TE>   "More than half the people are still out there," Foss said. "We
have the resources to help more people than we're helping now."</TE>
<TE>   Julio Cardoza, executive director of Casa Nicaragua in South Gate,
said his group has seen fewer people coming in for applications.</TE>
<TE>   Cardoza said he visits Nicaragua four times a year, and almost
four years after Hurricane Mitch, there are still few jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Nicaraguans living in the states send home $600 million to $800
million a year, he said. The money that they and Hondurans funnel
home is reason enough to grant the communities temporary legal
status, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Remittances more than dwarf any kind of foreign aid," he said.
"It's something that the U.S. can do that doesn't come out of the
Treasury."</TE>
<TE>   Renewal applications are available on the Internet (www.ins.gov)
and through the INS at 1-800-870-3676.</TE>
<TE>   They must be postmarked by July 2; local INS offices will not
accept the extension forms.</TE>

low-income students, many of whom are minorities.</LD>
<TE>   Because many students and parents work, they can't attend the
usual outreach meetings at K-12 schools, Mimms said. Others don't
feel comfortable at the events. It might be more effective to offer
application guidance and access to online college preparatory courses
at churches, mosques, temples or synagogues, Mimms said.</TE>
<TE>   The idea, still in its infancy, must be approved by either the UC
president's office or the Board of Regents, depending on how it is
funded. Because Gov. Gray Davis cut UC outreach funds in his latest
budget, the university will need eight to 12 months to determine
whether it can afford such a collaboration.</TE>
<TE>   But religious leaders already are intrigued. The Rev. Mark
Whitlock, a onetime critic of UC and the president of a Southern
California group that represents more than 600 black, Latino and
Asian churches, met with Mimms a month ago. He said after the
university eliminated affirmative action, some students felt
"unwanted."</TE>
<TE>   If UC officials used religious institutions to woo
underrepresented minorities (meaning Latino, African American and
Native American students, who make up 19% of students admitted), they
might feel more welcome, Whitlock said.</TE>
<TE>   In April, the university announced that the number of
underrepresented minorities admitted to its campuses had rebounded to
levels seen before the affirmative action ban took effect in 1998--at
every campus, that is, except UC Berkeley and UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Rising numbers or not, Whitlock said, some students still need
encouragement.</TE>
<TE>   The collaboration with religious groups would be a new recruiting
strategy for the UC system. But as far back as 1987, the California
State University system did something similar by working with the
Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles to recruit Latinos, said
Cheryl Fields, spokeswoman for the National Assn. of State
Universities and Land Grant Colleges.</TE>
<TE>   On their own, faith-based institutions have groomed students for
college for some time.</TE>
<TE>   Lesean Tarkington, 22, grew up as a member of South Los Angeles'
First AME congregation and participated in a college preparatory
program there. Early on, he learned how to handle a college
application and interview.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, Tarkington was accepted by both UC Berkeley and
UC Davis, but he chose to attend Wilberforce University in Ohio. He
felt the oldest private black college in the country would provide a
more comfortable environment.</TE>
<TE>   More students in his position might choose the University of
California if it joined forces with religious groups, he said.
"They'd think, 'Let me see if I can give it a shot.' "</TE>
<TE>   The religious groups are ready and waiting, said Bob Jackson,
pastor of Acts Full Gospel Church of God in Christ in Oakland, which
hosted a black education summit at which Mimms spoke in February.
"All we need are the people with the knowledge to bring it back and
share it with the people who don't have it," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   UC Regent Ward Connerly, who led the successful effort to pass
Proposition 209, the 1996 initiative ending affirmative action in
state admissions and hiring, said he supports the idea as long as it
focuses on attracting the "broadest segment of people possible." If
the university system targeted only students of a specific race, it
would directly violate Proposition 209, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Civil libertarians say they don't object to the alliance because
the university doesn't plan on championing a specific religion or
directing funds to faith-based institutions. "It should be fine as
long as no proselytizing takes place," said Ramona Ripston, executive
director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, a San Francisco-based public policy and advocacy
group wants to pilot a similar plan on a smaller scale.</TE>
<TE>   The Greenlining Institute, which has a partnership with UC, wants
to funnel college prep resources into three Los Angeles-area churches
by the beginning of the school year.</TE>
<TE>   Whitlock hopes the UC system learns from that program and begins
its own expanded version without delay. "I support research," he
said. "But we need people graduating now."</TE>

<HD>Hahn Says Ahmanson Plan Hurts the Valley</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn announced his opposition to what he
called the "unwise and harmful" Ahmanson Ranch development proposed
in Ventura County, threatening Tuesday to sue the developer because
of concerns about traffic and pollution.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn repeatedly said Tuesday that the housing development by
Washington Mutual bank would harm the neighboring San Fernando Valley
and that he is determined to block the $2-billion "mega project."</LD>
<LD>   The mayor has been eager to show his concern for the Valley as a
campaign to secede the area from Los Angeles has gained momentum.</LD>
<TE>   "Unlike the developers of Ahmanson Ranch, I listen to the people
right here in the Valley," Hahn said over the drone of nearby freeway
traffic as he spoke in the parking structure of a Sherman Oaks
shopping mall. "I'm listening. City government's listening.''</TE>
<TE>   Building 3,050 homes in the Simi Hills near the Ventura County
line would add 45,000 car trips each day to already-congested
freeways and roads connecting the project to Los Angeles, Hahn and
Ahmanson's other opponents maintain. Those additional cars would
pollute the air and, in turn, the water.</TE>
<TE>   "The developers get the profits," Hahn said. "People in L.A. get
the headaches."</TE>
<TE>   In a letter Tuesday to Washington Mutual, Hahn urged the
Seattle-based bank to study anew the environmental effects of
building a community of 10,000 people. Instead, Washington Mutual
should sell the ranchland to a conservancy to preserve it as open
space, Hahn wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's threat to "seek all legal remedies" to prevent the
project drew whoops and cheers Tuesday from about two dozen Ahmanson
Ranch opponents, including actor-director Rob Reiner and L.A. City
Councilman Dennis Zine.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Calabasas already has sued to block the Ahmanson Ranch
development. But Los Angeles, Hahn said after the public event, is
"the 800-pound gorilla."</TE>
<TE>   Washington Mutual is standing firm on its plan to break ground
next year, spokesman Tim McGarry said Tuesday. The project's
environmental study is up-to-date, the courts have upheld the
development as sound and the site is not for sale, he said. Blocking
construction would only worsen the region's housing shortage.</TE>
<TE>   "Through this entire process we have listened, and community input
has made a difference in the final form of the project," McGarry
said. "But now is the time to build the project."</TE>
<TE>   McGarry labeled Hahn's opposition to the project a "political
decision," but then backed off, saying, "I'm not going to speculate
about the mayor's motives."</TE>
<TE>   In making his announcement Tuesday, Hahn took little political
risk by joining the long list of politicians, environmentalists,
celebrities and homeowners who have spoken out against the
development.</TE>
<TE>   Although Hahn has no jurisdiction over Ventura County development,
his opposition may influence Washington Mutual, said Ventura County
Supervisor-elect Linda Parks, who opposes the project.</TE>

<HD>County's Police Win Back Pay</HD>
<DH>Labor: Judge orders officers at hospitals, parks and other
facilities to get $60 million and same wages as sheriff's deputies.
Appeal vowed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA and NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge ruled Tuesday that Los Angeles County must pay $60 million in
back wages to the 500-plus officers of the Office of Public Safety,
who patrol hospitals, parks and other county facilities.</LD>
<LD>   County officials called Superior Court Judge Victor Chavez's
decision possibly the largest verdict ever against the county. It
also comes at a time when officials are considering closing hospitals
for lack of funds.</LD>
<LD>   "I cannot remember anything of this magnitude before," said County
Counsel Lloyd W. Pellman.</LD>
<TE>   The ruling follows a jury verdict June 7 that said the county
racially discriminated against a police force made up mostly of
blacks and Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   County attorneys said Chavez ruled that the county must pay the
plaintiffs seven years' back pay totaling $60 million, boost their
pensions retroactively--again back seven years--to match those of
other law enforcement officers, and raise their salaries to the level
of sheriff's deputies. Plaintiffs' attorneys have argued that county
officers are paid about 30% to 40% less than deputies.</TE>
<TE>   Altogether, the verdict could cost the county $100 million, plus
increased yearly costs, those attorneys have estimated.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Mike Antonovich called the decision "boneheaded" and
predicted that it would be overturned on appeal.</TE>
<TE>   The "Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and the county safety
police have two different functions and responsibilities," Antonovich
said. "The requirements are different, as are the responsibilities.
The board strongly believes this decision will be reversed at the
appellate level because of this."</TE>
<TE>   But a lawyer for the officers has said it was the county that made
a foolish decision when it chose not to settle and instead go to
trial. A settlement could have saved the ailing county at least $35
million, plaintiffs' attorney Jack O'Donnell said last week.</TE>
<TE>   He and his colleagues would not comment Tuesday pending a news
conference today.</TE>
<TE>   If upheld, the verdict would be a financial blow to the county.
Next week, county supervisors are slated to approve a budget that
cuts $50 million from the Sheriff's Department and reduces social
services and library hours. They also will consider more than $100
million in cuts to the Department of Health Services, which faces an
$800-million deficit and the prospect of closing 11 clinics, ending
inpatient services at High Desert Hospital and eliminating thousands
of jobs.</TE>
<TE>   In October, the county is expected to consider closing even more
health facilities--including converting Harbor-UCLA and Olive View
medical centers into clinics. Tuesday's judgment represents enough
money to keep Olive View operating at full capacity for one year.</TE>
<TE>   County attorney Calvin House said the county pension fund will
have to hire an actuarial firm to determine the retirement benefits
owed to the officers.</TE>
<TE>   He added that the county plans to contest the verdict before
Chavez and then appeal if that fails.</TE>
<TE>   House said the county did not discriminate and had a fair reason
for paying different salaries.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to be a deputy sheriff, you get more pay, but you
have to spend three or four years working in the jails," he said. "Or
you can become safety police and begin patrol right away.... We make
all of our positions open to everybody. It's up to each individual to
decide what type of police officer they want to be."</TE>
<TE>   He argued that the reason the lower-paid force has more minorities
is because more apply for positions on it.</TE>
<TE>   But attorneys for the county officers say the suit was about
justice for a group of officers who risk their lives, only to be
ridiculed by county and Sheriff's Department officials as "sheriff's
wannabes."</TE>
<TE>   During a two-week trial, plaintiffs' attorneys argued that the
officers have battled street gangs, restrained often violent
psychiatric patients and lost colleagues in the line of duty, but
have been compensated more like security guards than police. Even
county lifeguards get pensions similar to police, while the officers
get the same as county secretaries, plaintiffs said.</TE>
<TE>   "Both deputies and county police have to deal with gangs. If a
deputy and a county cop get killed while battling gang members, the
deputy's family will be taken care of; the county police officer's
family gets nothing," O'Donnell said recently.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling is the latest conflict in a nearly century-long
dysfunctional relationship between the county and a police force
created in 1917 as a group of night watchmen. Over the years, the two
sides have squabbled over pay, duties, training and even what the
officers should be called.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, the county considered the officers security guards
and not full-fledged police officers. Only in the mid-1990s did the
county agree to give them the same training and certification that
all police officers receive.</TE>
<TE>   Officers argued that the county had a financial interest in
portraying them as security guards, making it easier to justify
reduced salaries and pensions.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department has discussed merging the officers into
their agency, but for a variety of reasons, that idea has always been
abandoned.</TE>

<HD>Probe of Bikers Nets 12 Arrests</HD>
<DH>Crime: A Vagos club member secretly helped investigators
build drug, weapons cases against his associates. The paid informant
reportedly wanted 'out of the life.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal and state authorities capped a two-year investigation into an
international motorcycle club Tuesday by arresting 12 people in four
counties on suspicion of drug and weapons charges, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The investigation centered on a member of the Vagos motorcycle
club who secretly cooperated with authorities, using government money
to buy illegal firearms and drugs, said Jeffrey Ferguson, an Orange
County deputy district attorney.</LD>
<LD>   The informant gave authorities unusual insight into the club's
plans to traffic methamphetamine and firearms, Ferguson said.</LD>
<TE>   In September, for example, authorities learned that club members
halted plans to transport drugs on commercial airplanes because of
heightened security after the terrorist attacks on New York and the
Pentagon, Ferguson said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities paid the informant a small amount of money for his
work, Ferguson said. The unidentified man had an extensive criminal
record and came forward more than two years ago. "He was really tired
of going to prison and wanted to get out of the life," Ferguson said.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, federal officials obtained grand jury indictments
and state criminal complaints against 12 people, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Teams of law enforcement officers fanned out across Los Angeles,
Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties Tuesday to serve
federal and state arrest warrants on the suspects, Ferguson said.</TE>
<TE>   Among those arrested were officers of several Vagos chapters, said
Letice Baker, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms. Authorities seized 85 firearms and an unspecified
quantity of narcotics, Baker said.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation was conducted by several agencies, including the
state Department of Justice, the ATF, the Orange County district
attorney's office, Santa Ana police and Los Angeles and San
Bernardino counties' sheriff's departments.</TE>
<TE>   Officials identified two suspects: Dennis Lee Watlington, 59, of
Rialto and Richard Garcia Jr., 43, of Westminster. They were held at
the Orange County Jail on $500,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   Watlington is charged with conspiring to sell an illegal assault
rifle and belonging to a criminal street gang. Because he was
convicted of assaulting a sheriff's deputy in Los Angeles County in
1999, he faces more than 20 years in prison, Ferguson said.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia is accused of selling an automatic weapon and a sawed-off
shotgun, Ferguson said.</TE>
<TE>   He too faces more than 20 years in prison, if convicted, Ferguson
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Vagos were formed in the 1960s to "survive the wars between
the rival clubs and the constant harassment of police," according to
a Vagos Web site.</TE>
<TE>   The group, with chapters throughout the United States and Mexico,
has issued press releases denying allegations of criminal activities.</TE>

<HD>Lawyers in Blake Case Argue Over Bail for the Actor</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge puts off a decision until next week. But he
allows a co-defendant to keep his attorney, who is being paid by
Blake.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Superior Court judge delayed a decision Tuesday on whether to set
bail for Robert Blake, but ruled that a lawyer the actor is paying
may continue to represent his co-defendant.</LD>
<LD>   Blake is charged with murder, two counts of soliciting murder and
conspiracy in the fatal shooting of his wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, near
a Studio City restaurant on May 4, 2001. Blake's bodyguard, Earle
Caldwell, is charged with conspiracy in the Bakley slaying. Both men
have pleaded not guilty.</LD>
<LD>   During a brief court hearing Tuesday in Van Nuys, Judge Lloyd M.
Nash allowed Caldwell, 46, to retain attorney Arna H. Zlotnik.</LD>
<TE>   Nash and prosecutors had voiced concerns about whether a criminal
defense attorney can accept money from one defendant to represent
another in the same case without feeling some loyalty to whomever is
paying the bills.</TE>
<TE>   Nash appointed criminal defense attorney Steve Sitkoff last month
to discuss potential conflicts of interest with Caldwell, who faces
life in prison if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Caldwell, who was released from custody in April after Blake
posted $1-million bail, told the judge Tuesday that he wanted to keep
Zlotnik as his lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, Blake's attorney, Harland W. Braun, filed a motion
claiming that the lead Los Angeles police detective investigating the
Bakley case was seeking fame. Braun contends that Det. Ronald Y. Ito
was disappointed by not getting enough media attention during the
O.J. Simpson murder case and is trying to make up for it with the
Blake case.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Attys. Patrick R. Dixon and Gregory A. Dohi defended
Ito in court documents.</TE>
<TE>   "Det. Ito is not cooperating in the production of any movie, nor
does he have a book deal," the prosecutors wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Braun also challenged whether enough evidence exists to support
charging Blake with capital murder. Prosecutors have said they will
not seek the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Braun has asked Nash to declare unconstitutional the lying-in-wait
special circumstance allegation against the 68-year-old actor, which
would make him eligible for bail. Blake has been held without bail at
Men's Central Jail in downtown Los Angeles since his April 18 arrest
at his Hidden Hills home.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors rebutted Braun's statements, saying he downplayed the
most compelling evidence against his client. It includes a prepaid
phone card that prosecutors say was used to conceal calls Blake made
from his home to ex-stuntmen from his 1970s television series
"Baretta" whom he allegedly asked to kill Bakley.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 126 calls made on the phone card, prosecutors say, 56 were
made to one of the stuntmen, two to the other man and 64 were to a
private investigator that Blake hired to investigate Bakley before he
married her. Authorities say Blake despised Bakley, whom he married
six months before her death after a paternity test proved that he
fathered her child.</TE>
<TE>   Nash set a June 27 hearing on the bail motion.</TE>

<HD>Dozens of Residents Flee Fire</HD>
<DH>Safety: San Bernardino County blaze burns 7,000 acres and
threatens homes near Hesperia. Its cause is under investigation.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>High temperatures and winds Tuesday continued to stoke a fire in San
Bernardino County that has burned 7,000 acres and forced dozens to
flee from their homes.</LD>
<LD>   As smoke billowed up and firetrucks flanked her house, Rebecca
Lewis of Summit Valley packed handfuls of clothes, photo albums and
her computer and prepared to hit the road.</LD>
<LD>   "You see all that brush," she said, pointing to a hill covered in
dried-out bushes and spiny trees. "Some of that hasn't burned in 30
years. I think I'm just starting to hit panic mode."</LD>
<TE>   About 6 a.m. Tuesday, Lewis, 52, had climbed aboard the family's
bulldozer and cleared vegetation to create a protective swath around
her home.</TE>
<TE>   But by afternoon, she and her neighbors in Summit Valley, south of
Hesperia, were given voluntary evacuation orders as the Blue Cut fire
pushed toward their homes. Code enforcement officers urged them to
leave immediately, warning that there might not be time to issue a
mandatory evacuation order.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were you, I'd go right now," Ronnie Andrews from code
enforcement told Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze, which began burning near Interstate 15 and the Cajon
Pass on Sunday afternoon and twice forced the closure of that
highway, was only 25% contained Tuesday evening, and California 138
was closed east of I-15.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, officials evacuated residents from the unincorporated
area of Oak Hills, south of Hesperia, and temporarily closed I-15
after flames jumped the freeway. Residents were allowed to return
home late Monday evening, and the freeway was reopened. But Tuesday,
as the fire spread, residents in Summit Valley were asked to leave
and officials prepared evacuation centers to accept livestock. No
homes had burned and no injuries were reported Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said they don't know when they will have the fire
contained. Its cause is still under investigation. More than 1,100
firefighters battled the blaze, aided by nine air tankers and eight
helicopters. The cost of fighting the fire has been estimated at
$1.13 million.</TE>
<TE>   To the west, firefighters in Los Angeles and Kern counties were
tackling a blaze near Gorman that knocked two of the state's major
power transmission lines out of service. Fanned by winds of up to 25
mph, the fire had scorched more than 1,000 acres in about four hours
since it was first reported at 2:30 p.m. near the Golden State
Freeway and Lancaster Road.</TE>

<HD>J.C. Brown, 67; Led National Gallery of Art</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>J. Carter Brown, the former director of the National Gallery of Art
in Washington credited with turning the modest federal museum into a
player on the national art scene, died Monday. He was 67.</LD>
<LD>   Brown, who retired from the National Gallery in 1992 after 23
years of leadership, died at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston
after a six-week battle with a blood cancer.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to his role at the National Gallery, Brown spent 30
years as director of the U.S. Commission on Fine Arts, which oversees
the District of Columbia's public art and architectural endeavors,
including the once-controversial Vietnam Veterans Memorial.</LD>
<TE>   Brown resigned that post in May after being hospitalized for lung
ailments that followed treatment for multiple myeloma. A successor
has not been named.</TE>
<TE>   Brown's determined mission to expand the art audience at the
National Gallery resulted in such blockbuster exhibitions as "The
Treasures of Tutankhamun"(1977), "The Treasure Houses of Britain"
(1986) and "Circa 1492: Art in the Age of Exploration" (1992).</TE>
<TE>   Earl A. Powell III, current director of the National Gallery, said
Tuesday that Brown's spectacular shows created a model for museums
around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "The large shows were something that he believed greatly in, in
terms of expanding a museum's mission and its goals," said Powell,
who spent four years at the National Gallery as executive curator in
the mid-1970s, coinciding with the Tut exhibition. "The biggest one
during Carter's time was 'Treasure Houses'; in terms of attendance,
that was the largest show the gallery has had in 20 years."</TE>
<TE>   A devoted multiculturalist, Brown saw to it that many of the
National Gallery's temporary exhibitions were devoted to non-European
art. Such efforts led one Washington Post writer to dub Brown, born
to great wealth in Providence, R.I., the "populist patrician."</TE>
<TE>   During Brown's tenure, the National Gallery's annual budget grew
from $3.2 million to $52 million; annual attendance leaped from 1.3
million to 7 million. About 20,000 works of art were added to the
collections.</TE>
<TE>   In 1978, the gallery unveiled its East Wing, designed by I.M. Pei.
Brown called the opening of the contemporary structure the high point
of his administration.</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy Strick, director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los
Angeles, worked for Brown at the National Gallery for six years
beginning in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Carter will play a big role in the history of American
museums," Strick said. "He is someone who effectively re-created the
National Gallery, both as a generator of great exhibitions, and as a
center of official culture in Washington. 'Sleepy' is the term people
used for the gallery before Carter. That's the last term you would
use to describe Carter.</TE>
<TE>   "Carter redefined the gallery's relationship to modern and
contemporary art," Strick said. "He allowed the work of living
artists into the National Gallery for the first time; he filled a
stunning and striking contemporary building with contemporary art.
This was revolutionary."</TE>
<TE>   Brown also served as chairman of the jury for architecture's
prestigious Pritzker Prize, and was a founding investor in the
Ovation arts cable channel, which was launched in 1996. Ovation
President Hal Morse said Brown saw the venture as an extension of his
effort to bring art to the people.</TE>
<TE>   "We were both fond of saying that we saw Ovation as the light we
use to help understand the shadows," Morse said.</TE>
<TE>   Brown continued the tradition of his National Gallery exhibitions
by organizing "Rings: Five Passions in World Art," a $3.2-million
show of objects from 44 countries for the Olympic Games in Atlanta in
1996.</TE>
<TE>   Brown made an equally strong impression on the nation's capital as
leader of the Commission on Fine Arts. Charles H. Atherton, secretary
of the commission, called it highly unusual for a director to survive
the administrations of seven presidents. "That takes a lot of
political acuity, shall we say," Atherton said.</TE>
<TE>   As head of the commission, Brown oversaw the development of the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial. The design, selected in 1980, was
conceived by Maya Lin, a then-21-year-old undergraduate architecture
student at Yale University. Selected from more than 1,400 entries,
her design was a simple V-shaped wall of polished black granite,
chiseled with the names of the more than 58,000 men and women who had
died in Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   Some conservatives opposed Lin's design, calling its "V" shape too
reminiscent of the peace sign. Others called the memorial a "black
gash of shame and sorrow."</TE>
<TE>   The commission's Atherton believes that Brown saved the memorial
during its early construction phases by accommodating political
pressure from then-U.S. Interior Secretary James Watt to add a more
traditional sculpture of three infantrymen near the wall. That
sculpture was put in place in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   "Carter had the political acumen to see that, unless some gesture
was made, Watt would simply not have issued the construction permit,"
Atherton said. "What Brown did was devise a wonderful scheme where he
added the three-soldiers sculpture, but it was off to one side. It
was brilliant."</TE>
<TE>   Brown showed a little less political acumen in his protest of
another addition, the Vietnam Women's Memorial, Atherton said. "He
made some remark along the lines of: 'The next thing you know, we'll
have a memorial to the canines,' " Atherton said with a laugh. "That
wasn't a great juxtaposition."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Brown's objections, the sculpture of three women and a
wounded soldier was set in place in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, Brown was instrumental in obtaining congressional
and presidential approval for the much-debated World War II Memorial,
to be built near the Vietnam Memorial.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, a descendant of the founders of Brown University, was born
on Oct. 8, 1934. His father, John Nicholas Brown, inherited so much
money at birth that the press dubbed him "the world's richest baby."
J. Carter Brown was schooled at Groton and Harvard before embarking
on a tour of art study in Paris, the Netherlands, Italy and New York.</TE>
<TE>   Brown was 14 when he drove past the National Gallery's imposing
marble building and announced to his parents that he would run the
place someday.</TE>
<TE>   He achieved that goal in 1969 when his predecessor, John Walker,
announced his retirement.</TE>
<TE>   At age 35, Brown, who was then assistant director of the gallery,
became the youngest director of any major art gallery in the country.</TE>
<TE>   He shocked the art world with his decision to step down in 1992,
at the height of his success.</TE>
<TE>   He explained his decision in an interview several years later: "It
was pretty hard to top what I'd been up to before I left: the '1492'
show and the gallery's 50th anniversary. It's good to get out while
you still have the energy to do something new."</TE>
<TE>   On May 21, Brown sent a letter to 20 arts organizations--an
eclectic list including Brown University, the World Monuments Fund,
the National Geographic Society and the John F. Kennedy Center for
the Performing Arts--severing all formal ties, such as his board
memberships.</TE>
<TE>   The letter was issued from the hospital, to which he had been
rushed May 3 after having difficulty breathing. In the missive, Brown
described his ailments and said he needed time to recuperate.</TE>
<TE>   He also wrote of plans to finish a memoir about himself and his
father, and to spend time with his fiancee, Anne Hawley, director of
Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.</TE>
<TE>   Brown is survived by a son, Jay; a daughter, Elissa; his brother,
Nicholas Brown; and his sister, Angela Fischer.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service will be held June 25 in Providence. Another
will be scheduled at the National Cathedral in Washington.</TE>

<HD>School Says Its 2-Site Strategy Makes the Cut</HD>
<DH>Barber college has a black-oriented campus in
South-Central, multi- ethnic one downtown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At most schools, racial segregation is anathema. But at barber
colleges, instructors say a little bit of ethnic separation sometimes
can ease the teaching process.</LD>
<LD>   At least that's the reason American Barber College owner Claude
Gipson gives for splitting his Los Angeles school between two
campuses, one in South-Central that caters to African American
students and clients, and another downtown, where the mostly Latino
students practice on customers of all ethnicities.</LD>
<LD>   American Barber College is one of six licensed Southern California
schools exclusively devoted to barbering and the only one in the
region with two campuses, according to state records.</LD>
<TE>   Gipson hopes students eventually learn to cut all types of hair
after passing the test for their barber's licenses. But at first, he
encourages black students to go to the South-Central location and
others to attend classes downtown because, he said, the clients' hair
textures and styling needs are so different.</TE>
<TE>   "Experience has taught us that instructors and students can have a
difficult time learning on hair of a different race," Gipson said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the state's Department of Consumer Affairs, which
oversees the Bureau of Barbering and Cosmetology, said it is not
unusual or illegal to establish locations to target certain groups or
customize a curriculum to fit a student's future clientele.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly makes sense as a good marketing niche if nothing
else," said Mike Luery, department spokesman. He added that the
department has not received any segregation complaints about the
college.</TE>
<TE>   Eugene Williams said he disregarded Gipson's advice and chose to
attend classes downtown, where he is the sole black among the
branch's 17 students. Williams said he believes he will have more
career opportunities if he practices haircutting on clients of all
races.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to cheat myself," said Williams, 49, who lives in
the West Adams district. "I'm going to learn how to do it all so that
I can go to any shop and step right in."</TE>
<TE>   The South-Central facility, near Slauson and Vermont avenues, has
a bright stucco facade painted in the red, white and blue stripes of
a barber pole.</TE>
<TE>   None of the 25 students at that branch has had a customer who
wasn't black.</TE>
<TE>   Gipson spends most days at that campus, where he and his family
are as much a part of its atmosphere as the worn black barber chairs
and scuffed pistachio green floor tiles.</TE>
<TE>   His wife is an instructor, his daughter manages the office and
graduates work at the barbershop next door.</TE>
<TE>   Students and customers constantly call greetings to "Mr. G," who
chats with each of them before returning to the cashier's office, a
closet-sized room lined with bottles of hair wax and oil.</TE>
<TE>   Raised in an east Texas orphanage, Gipson started cutting the
other children's hair when he was 12. He taught at other schools
before buying the South-Central location in 1973, about 25 years
after it was founded, and soon added the downtown branch.</TE>
<TE>   The basic curriculum is the same at both branches, although the
downtown branch's diverse clientele means students have to master
different tools and more styles so they can clip a black man's fade
as easily as they can trim a Latino's. Doughnuts are provided each
morning to prime students for lessons on such topics as shop
management, scalp care and chemical straightening.</TE>
<TE>   For those with no prior barber or cosmetology training, the
college requires 1,500 hours of coursework.</TE>
<TE>   The course costs about $6,000, including tuition, tools and
registration fees, and students have up to three years to complete
the requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Students must cut 750 heads of hair before taking the state
barber's license exam. They work on customers willing to take a
chance on a student's skill in exchange for a price--usually $5--that
is much lower than at regular barbershops. The college keeps the $5,
and students take home the tips.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on students' experience, it can take from one haircut to
three weeks to prove their competence.</TE>
<TE>   Then they can work without the facility's two instructors hovering
constantly, although teachers still monitor them.</TE>
<TE>   About 90% of American Barber College students pass the state
barber licensing exam on their first try, according to records from
the Bureau of Barbering and Cosmetology. State officials said that
rate is slightly above average.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Thursday at the South-Central campus, students in blue
nylon smocks were cutting, trimming or shaving clients while others
waited for more customers. A toddler squirmed in a booster seat as a
student clipped his head, and a stone-faced man closed his eyes for
the half-hour it took Kenneth Grant to trim his gray mane.</TE>
<TE>   Grant, who lives in Leimert Park, hopes to open his own shop in
South-Central.</TE>
<TE>   He worked in construction before starting classes three months
ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to get my career off the ground, and I feel like I'm
part of a family at this place," said Grant, 28, his large fingers
squeezed through the handles of his scissors as he followed the
curves of the customer's head.</TE>
<TE>   "Since I want to work in this community with this kind of people,
it's right for me to get really good at black hair rather than
clutter up my mind with learning about every type of hair in the
world."</TE>
<TE>   At the downtown branch, a steady stream of customers flows into
the shop each afternoon, walking from nearby skid row and the jewelry
district or arriving via the subway, which stops across the street at
Pershing Square.</TE>
<TE>   Selvin Buchanan has been coming from Compton every three weeks for
the last five years to get a haircut at the downtown college.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't go there if he's in a hurry, because students' haircuts
can take up to an hour. But he doesn't mind the chance to relax.</TE>
<TE>   "I like their work, and it would get really expensive to get my
hair cut that often by a professional," said Buchanan, 34.</TE>
<TE>   A few chairs down, instructor Blanca Polanco sighed when a
customer grunted his disapproval at a student's first attempts at
trimming the man's bushy gray hair.</TE>
<TE>   As Polanco picked up the clippers to finish the job, she said
learning to adapt to different hair types is key for people who want
to work outside a certain ethnic community.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of our students pay from their own pockets to get this
license they'll have for the rest of their lives," said Polanco, 47.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's good they have a chance to make the choice where
they want to learn these skills."</TE>

<HD>D.A.'s Charity Says Report Off-Limits</HD>
<DH>Politics: Supervisors want an accounting. Earlier finding
said 71% of funds went to lawyers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nonprofit charity group established by Dist. Atty. Tony
Rackauckas has refused a request by the Orange County Board of
Supervisors for a detailed breakdown of the organization's spending,
citing attorney-client protections.</LD>
<LD>   The board requested the records after financial statements filed
by Rackauckas in May showed that 71% of the $58,000 raised by the
group went to pay attorneys representing the charity's board members
during an investigation into the group by the state attorney
general's office.</LD>
<LD>   The Tony Rackauckas Foundation, renamed the District Attorney
Advisory Commission last year, was ordered disbanded after Atty. Gen.
Bill Lockyer's office concluded it failed to "govern its operations"
and "exercise proper care in managing [its] assets."</LD>
<TE>   Only $450 raised by the group went to programs furthering the
charity's goal of helping troubled county youth, County Executive
Officer Michael Schumacher told supervisors Tuesday. Most of the
money raised by the charity came from donations by board members. But
the group also received an estimated $2,443 in support from the
county in the form of staff time and use of facilities.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter last week to Rackauckas, the group's chairman, Gabriel
Nassar, refused requests by supervisors and Rackauckas for its
records. Nassar said the charity had $750 in the bank and an
outstanding $1,000 attorney bill. In financial statements provided by
Rackauckas in May, about $6,455 in expenses were unaccounted for.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Todd Spitzer criticized the group Tuesday for refusing
to turn over its records. The county allows 40 charities to use
public resources for various causes, including 24 groups that raise
money for public libraries. However, the county didn't envision a
charity board would invoke attorney-client privilege, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If they use public resources, the public has a right to see these
documents," Spitzer said.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher will propose changes in July to the county's charity
policy. The changes include requiring county-affiliated charities to
turn over financial and other records and for charity board members
to be covered by insurance.</TE>

<HD>Seeing Red Over Off-Color Parody</HD>
<DH>Media: The editor of UC Davis' student newspaper may lose
job over raunchy spoof issue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN and REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The spoof issue of UC Davis' student newspaper, an annual mix of
mischief and journalism, has sparked a brouhaha that could lead to an
overhaul of the paper's operations.</LD>
<LD>   Responding to complaints about sexual and racial references in the
year-end parody section, the student-dominated Campus Media Board
agreed Tuesday to consider firing the newspaper's new editor in
chief.</LD>
<LD>   The editor, Fitz Vo, assumed leadership of the California Aggie on
June 1.</LD>
<TE>   The section that triggered the uproar, a six-page insert titled
the "The Ivory Basement," appeared June 7, the last day of regular
classes. One of the most controversial items was an image of a
phallic symbol that was digitally superimposed in the middle of a
photo of children playing on the campus' two "egghead" sculptures.</TE>
<TE>   Another photo showed a white student holding a knife while eyeing
an African American student who was the student government president
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Alice Hannam, a UC Davis staffer who is head of the media board,
called the section "mean-spirited, incredibly juvenile and, in a
couple instances, ugly."</TE>
<TE>   Vo, a 20-year-old majoring in communications and math,
acknowledged that he is guilty of lapses in judgment. The Vietnamese
American junior, who listed himself in the spoof issue as "editor in
chink," said the issue was "not indicative of what I intend to do in
my tenure at the Aggie."</TE>
<TE>   He urged the board to let him stay on in the job and consider such
measures as hiring a faculty advisor to work with the newspaper. Vo
said he is open to suggestions, and that he doesn't want "to
jeopardize the Aggie's journalistic integrity."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the students and others complaining about the spoof issue
say that it's too late to save the Aggie's integrity. Mary Vasquez, a
UC Davis student who is a frequent critic of the student newspaper
and who was a target of a sexually explicit insult, urged the media
board to take action against the paper.</TE>
<TE>   Vasquez, the appointed head of UC Davis' ethnic and cultural
affairs commission and a member of its Student Senate, said the
edition "was racist, sexist, homophobic and vulgar. They wrote a hit
piece ... and they shouldn't get away with it."</TE>
<TE>   She asked the board to discipline any students involved in
publication of the item that named her, to require the Aggie to
apologize in its first summer and first fall editions, and to send
its staffers to mandatory diversity and sexual harassment sessions.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't the first outcry over the parody edition at the UC
Davis newspaper. In the late 1990s, a cartoon depicted an explosion
at the campus' Hart Hall, a building housing ethnic studies
departments.</TE>
<TE>   University officials responded by, among other things,
establishing a new newspaper policy on handling sensitive issues and
launching a journalism writing course.</TE>
<TE>   It also made the parody issue, a campus tradition for at least 20
years, the responsibility of the incoming editor in chief instead of
the outgoing, and possibly graduating, editor in chief.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the 1st Amendment protects parody on and off campus,
several observers said that spoof editions aren't as widespread as
they were in their heyday of the 1960s and 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   College news media advisors say the fear of lawsuits may be one of
the reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "We would say, 'Don't do spoofs. It's kind of like walking into
quicksand,' " said Ronald Spielberger, executive director of College
Media Advisors, a national group of campus officials who oversee
student news media.</TE>
<TE>   Students, he said, may not recognize when they cross the line
between poking fun and libel.</TE>
<TE>   Vo said he is smarting from the reaction to his experience at UC
Davis. "I love the Aggie a lot, and I hope it shows next year," he
said. "This is a downer of a way to start."</TE>

<HD>Jack Dutton, 92; Anaheim Leader Helped Lure Angels</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jack Cottrell Dutton, the former Anaheim mayor credited with playing
a key role in bringing the Angels baseball team to town and building
one of the busiest convention centers in the nation, has died. He was
92.</LD>
<LD>   Dutton died June 15 at West Anaheim Medical Center after a brief
bout with pneumonia.</LD>
<LD>   He was a successful entrepreneur who kept exotic
animals--including a bear, lion and ostrich--at his restaurant.</LD>
<TE>   Family and friends nicknamed him "John Wayne Dutton" for his
contagious smile and earnest charm. "He was a modern-day P.T.
Barnum," said his stepdaughter, Cathy Dutton of Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   A star baseball player at Anaheim High School, Dutton never gave
up his love for the game.</TE>
<TE>   Dutton served as an Anaheim councilman from 1962 to 1970 and then
served a four-year term as mayor. During his time on the council, the
members approached Gene Autry with the proposal that he bring his Los
Angeles Angels to Anaheim. Autry would, if the city would build a
stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The city council agreed, and Dutton and Autry shook hands on the
deal to move the team, renamed the California Angels, to the city at
the start of the 1966 season.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very much the old-fashioned, take-charge type of person.
He believed your word was your bond and a handshake was all you
needed; you didn't need all these attorneys. And that's what he liked
about Gene Autry, he was a man of his word," Cathy Dutton said.</TE>
<TE>   A bond was passed to fund the stadium, now known as Edison
International Field, and the Anaheim Convention Center, located near
Disneyland. The decision drew public outrage because it increased
taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "Jack used to say, 'There is no security on this Earth, only
opportunity,' " said Dutton's longtime friend Tom Liegler, former
general manager for the stadium and convention center.</TE>
<TE>   "He looked at the stadium and convention center as two gigantic
memorials of the council's vision back in the 1960s," Liegler said.</TE>
<TE>   An Anaheim native, Dutton was raised on his grandmother's ranch
after his parents divorced. He started his business career by selling
wiping rags to service stations, shipyards and oil refineries. The
business had made him a millionaire by his 40s and he retired early.</TE>
<TE>   In 1951, he founded Jungle Gardens and the Palms Restaurant, a
nightspot with a lush tropical garden, where luaus for up to 1,500
people were held.</TE>
<TE>   Dutton married twice. He is survived by his wife, Kay, two
children and three stepchildren, four grandchildren and five
great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A public memorial is planned at 11 a.m. Saturday at Edison Field.
The Dutton family has requested that in lieu of flowers, donations be
made to the Anaheim Local History Room. Checks can be made out to
Anaheim Public Library Gift Fund and sent to Jack Dutton Gift Fund,
c/o Anaheim Public Library, 500 W. Broadway, Anaheim, CA 92805.</TE>

<HD>Council Vetoes Bid to Cancel DWP Pact</HD>
<DH>Finances: The city controller wanted to complete an audit
before public relations contract for green power program was
approved.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council vetoed Controller Laura Chick's efforts
to kill a multimillion-dollar public relations contract for the
Department of Water and Power.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this month, Chick asked DWP commissioners to hold off on
approving the $2.4-million deal with the Lee Andrews Group to provide
community outreach for the green power program until she completed an
audit next month of the $60-million public benefits program, which
funds the contract.</LD>
<LD>   The agency refused, saying that it was imperative to keep
conservation programs visible as the city enters the energy-intensive
summer months. Chick then urged the council to take control of the
contract.</LD>
<TE>   Seizing jurisdiction over the DWP's approval required 10 of 15
council members' votes. On Tuesday, the council voted 7 to 7 to take
up the matter.</TE>
<TE>   The PR firm will work with community-based organizations to spread
the DWP's message on renewable energy, conservation, energy
efficiency and other environmental issues through May 31. The
contract includes an optional one-year, $2.4-million extension.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, dozens of environmentalists, religious leaders,
businesspeople and others packed council chambers to support the
contract.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Jack Weiss, who sponsored the motion to kill the
contract, said it was improperly turned into a referendum on the
environmental program, rather than on DWP spending habits. "People
tried to spin this that if you vote for the ... motion, you're
against green power," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss had offered a compromise, asking the DWP to change to a
month-to-month contract until the audit is completed.</TE>
<TE>   DWP commissioners canceled the meeting where such a move could
have taken place, saying that they lacked quorum.</TE>
<TE>   DWP General Manager David Wiggs reiterated that the contract has a
30-day termination clause and will be revisited after the audit,
which convinced some council members to vote against getting
involved.</TE>
<TE>   "I have complete confidence that if the audit comes back with
something questionable," DWP commissioners will look into it,
Councilwoman Janice Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel we need to go and be [such] micromanagers," she
said.</TE>

<LD>The Los Angeles City Council unanimously passed an ordinance Tuesday
making it illegal for airline passengers to pack gun parts and
ammunition in carry-on luggage.</LD>
<LD>   The ordinance, which goes into effect 30 days after the mayor
signs it, makes these actions misdemeanors punishable with up to six
months in jail or a fine of up to $1,000.</LD>
<LD>   Councilman Jack Weiss said he was amazed that there were no laws
restricting such items, which could result in a weapon being
assembled on flight.</LD>
<TE>   Weiss initially learned of the problem when looking into a state
effort to plug the loophole.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation, which was drafted by state Sen. Jack Scott
(D-Altadena), would make it a misdemeanor to possess parts of
firearms or fake weapons at the state's airports and bus, train and
subway stations.</TE>
<TE>   "Why wait on them in Sacramento to make it state law when we can
act and act right now and make it a crime in Los Angeles?" Weiss said
before the council's 12-0 vote.</TE>
<TE>   The council also urged state and federal lawmakers to approve
similar measures.</TE>

<HD>Koreatown Erupts in Joy, Pride</HD>
<DH>Sports: World Cup win over heavily favored Italian team
sparks a spontaneous celebration.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAREN BRISCOE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>World Cup fever gripped another pocket of Los Angeles on Tuesday
morning.</LD>
<LD>   Again it struck before dawn, with motorists blaring their horns
and grinning uncontrollably, people breaking into spontaneous
laughter and a sudden profusion of flags flown from car windows or
worn as clothing.</LD>
<LD>   This time, however, it was in Koreatown. And unlike Monday's game
in which Mexico lost to the United States, this time the sentimental
favorite was the winner.</LD>
<TE>   South Korea, expected to lose its 4:30 a.m. televised match to
heavily favored Italy, hadn't won a single game in five previous
trips to the worldwide tournament. But in the 27th minute of
overtime, South Korea's Ahn Jung-hwan scored the winning goal,
beating Italy 2-1 and sending the team to the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   "Italy was the favorite," said an ecstatic Richard Won, 22. "But I
knew we would win."</TE>
<TE>   Won was one of several hundred fans of the South Korean team who
gathered in a mini-mall parking lot at 6th Street and Alexandria
Avenue to celebrate. After watching the game at home, Won saw news
broadcasts of the impromptu gathering and headed for the party.
Before leaving, he stripped the large Korean flag hanging from his
bedroom wall and affixed it to the door of his powder-blue Toyota
Celica.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen anything like it," Won said. "Everybody is going
crazy."</TE>
<TE>   The crowd was large enough to stop early morning traffic, though
fans arriving after 8:30 were latecomers. Police were dispatched, but
no one was hurt or arrested, said LAPD spokesman Jason Lee.</TE>
<TE>   The celebrants included Ellen Cho and two friends who drove to
Koreatown from Santa Fe Springs, Cho wearing a red T-shirt to show
her support for the team, the Red Devils.</TE>
<TE>   The three had watched the game at Petra Joosung Church after a
morning prayer meeting. Cho said the 5:20 a.m. meeting was
rescheduled for 4 a.m. to avoid a conflict with the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people were praying a little harder than usual," Cho
said. "I know I was."</TE>
<TE>   Many fans watched the upset from big-screen televisions set up by
local business owners such as Yeun Dan Lee at her Albenei restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   In honor of the team's accomplishments, Lee has served free
lunches to 300 to 400 customers after each victory.</TE>
<TE>   Her voice nearly spent from shouting, Lee nonetheless smiled and
vowed to continue with the free food as long as the team wins.</TE>
<TE>   "If they win [the tournament], maybe I'll have free food all day,"
Lee said.</TE>
<TE>   Surrounded by ecstatic teenagers, many with faces painted in the
red, white and blue of the Korean flag, Samuel Kang, 51, stood
proudly, his back ramrod straight.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in my team and in my country," Kang said, his voice
breaking. "I'm very happy."</TE>

<HD>Airport Agency Plugs Budget Gap</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The double whammy of increased security costs and lost concession
revenue brought on by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks caused a
$100-million shortfall in the 2001-2002 budget for the city agency
that operates Los Angeles International Airport, officials reported
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Officials met the shortfall by cutting other expenses and by
tapping a healthy reserve, but uncertainty about the cost of
complying with new federal aviation security laws could strain the
airport agency's $790-million budget for the fiscal year that begins
July 1. The plan is 19% greater than the $663-million budget for
2001-2002.</LD>
<LD>   "Security is really driving everything we do," said Karen Sisson,
the Airport Commission's chief financial officer. "It's impacting
most every other objective we might have."</LD>
<TE>   New security rules instituted after the skyjackings, including one
that allows only ticketed passengers beyond checkpoints, forced
concession revenue--the airport agency's second-biggest
moneymaker--down 35% in 2001-2002.</TE>
<TE>   The drop-off in concessions--which was not as severe as
expected--spurred the agency to cut its budget by 16%, in part by
instituting a hiring freeze and temporarily suspending all capital
improvement projects.</TE>
<TE>   Security costs almost doubled to $78 million in 2001-2002,
including paying overtime to airport police officers, reimbursing the
LAPD for additional personnel and operating a remote lot where people
could pick up and drop off passengers while the central terminal area
was closed. In the three days the airport was closed immediately
after the attacks, security costs totaled $2.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   Despite these costs, the airport agency said it will emerge
relatively unscathed because it was able to reduce other expenses,
dip into cash reserves and increase landing fees to make up for the
shortfall. Strong cash reserves, gleaned in part from years of growth
in concession sales before Sept. 11, and virtually no debt also
helped the agency weather the effects of the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to finish the year much better than anyone
predicted," Sisson said during a presentation to the airport agency
Tuesday. "We're in a good position when compared with other
airports."</TE>
<TE>   The agency made up for the $100-million shortfall in 2001-2002 by
reaping $68 million in savings from in-house cost-cutting and by
taking $32 million from its reserves. These reserves were replenished
recently when the city received a $35-million reimbursement from the
federal government for construction costs on Taxiway C. The airport
agency was able to apply for the funds after Mayor James K. Hahn
lifted a ban on accepting federal grant money earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   The financial effect brought on by the terrorist attacks will
continue to be felt in the new budget, Sisson said. Concession
revenue is projected to be down 30%. Airline revenue, the airport
agency's largest moneymaker, however, is expected to increase 22%--in
part due to an increase in landing fees imposed earlier this year to
cover the increased security.</TE>
<TE>   Security costs are expected to nearly double from $35 million last
year to $68 million to allow the agency to hire police officers, pay
increased insurance premiums and compensate consultants studying how
to redesign airport facilities to comply with new aviation security
laws.</TE>
<TE>   Those laws could conceivably add even more expenses to the
agency's 2002-2003 budget, Sisson said.</TE>

<LD>I was all set to run out to Palm Desert to investigate a possible
terrorist threat Tuesday when another one surfaced off the coast of
Southern California near Santa Catalina Island. By midday, I was
frozen in place, a victim of fear and loathing in the new world.</LD>
<LD>   As someone who has seen the movie "The Russians Are Coming, the
Russians Are Coming," about 600 times, I had a mental picture of
terrorists commandeering the Wrigley mansion on Catalina, but being
put down in the end by the saber-rattling Avalon militia, led by
characters resembling Paul Ford and Michael J. Pollard.</LD>
<LD>   But before I take you to Avalon, let's go to Palm Desert.</LD>
<TE>   George Lauer, 77, had sent along a note from out there, informing
me that residents of his seniors' apartment complex were warned by
management to be on the lookout for suspicious activities and
possible terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "Nonspecific terrorist threats could exist within apartment
communities," read the warning. "We urge you to be on the alert for
any unusual or suspicious activity."</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Lauer, who used to be an international tour operator, was
simply not convinced that Al Qaeda terrorists would try to infiltrate
a housing complex occupied primarily by retirees like himself.
Furthermore, he was upset about "little old ladies" being unduly
alarmed, as he told me by phone.</TE>
<TE>   The big event of their day, Lauer said, was watching for the
mailman. There's no telling what nerve damage has been caused by
asking them to be on the lookout for Bin Laden's army.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone's becoming paranoid," Lauer said, speaking not just for
Palm Desert, but the nation at large.</TE>
<TE>   I agreed that it was most likely an overreaction. But then came
news of a report that 40 Al Qaeda terrorists steamed toward the
Southern California coast in May, armed and dangerous, with a plan to
stop near Santa Catalina Island before launching an attack on Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials said they checked out the report, which was based on
intelligence, and found nothing to substantiate it.</TE>
<TE>   But wait a minute.</TE>
<TE>   How do you get around on Catalina?</TE>
<TE>   By golf cart, of course, because cars are banned on the island.</TE>
<TE>   And how do you get around Palm Desert? Well, it's a golf mecca,
and a lot of folks are never out of their golf carts.</TE>
<TE>   Coincidence?</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps. But guess what the name of Lauer's apartment complex is.</TE>
<TE>   Catalina Gardens!</TE>
<TE>   I have the chills.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not enough to make me leave the island, but it's a little
scary," Lupe Sanchez said from Avalon when I asked what she thought
of her tiny island being dragged onto the international stage.</TE>
<TE>   She was working alone as a receptionist at the Santa Catalina Co.,
which is owned by the Wrigleys, and didn't know the scuttlebutt on
the rest of the island.</TE>
<TE>   That's exactly how it was in "The Russians Are Coming." People
were isolated, and the enemy took advantage.</TE>
<TE>   I called Avalon Liquor &amp; Gifts, where a clerk named Connie said
she hadn't heard a thing.</TE>
<TE>   "You're kidding me," she said when I filled her in. And then she
added, "I have a suspicious-looking guy in here right now. Sir, do
you have some ID?"</TE>
<TE>   Over at the Chamber of Commerce, President Wayne Griffin hoped
potential tourists wouldn't get the idea that terrorists had raised a
flag on Catalina. The island is in the middle of its "Buffaloes in
Paradise" promotion.</TE>
<TE>   What's that? I asked.</TE>
<TE>   "We have 25 life-size fiberglass buffaloes decorated in a
whimsical fashion."</TE>
<TE>   I'd keep an eye on the buffaloes. We all know the story of the
Trojan horse.</TE>
<TE>   Now look, I don't mean to diminish the possibility or seriousness
of actual threats. If a ship can drop 10 Chinese refugees into the
surf off Newport Beach, as happened last month, there's no telling
what's possible on our western flank.</TE>
<TE>   One thing that's so absurd about Palm Desert and Catalina as
launch sites for acts of terror is that a small piece of you says:
Wait a minute, maybe it's possible--a two-pronged attempt to break
our spirit.</TE>
<TE>   But let's keep our heads.</TE>
<TE>   "Should we all be concerned about something happening in Southern
California? You bet," said Griffin, Catalina's chamber chief. "But
the enemy wants us to get all worked up and wonder if there's an
explosion around every corner."</TE>
<TE>   And yet, in "The Russians Are Coming," the Russians actually
landed on the fictional New England island (a.k.a. Mendocino,
Calif.).</TE>
<TE>   If you've forgotten the plot of the 1966 anti-war movie, the
islanders ultimately bond with the Russians, a soldier falls in love
with a blond beauty, and a ragtag local armada escorts the Reds
safely back to their grounded sub, ending the threat of nuclear
holocaust.</TE>
<TE>   If only they made movies, and wars, like they used to.</TE>

<HD>School Mascot Protesters, Police Clash Outside Fullerton
Meeting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shouting and shoving broke out between police and demonstrators
outside a Fullerton school board meeting Tuesday, and a woman was
arrested after she refused to move from an exit.</LD>
<LD>   About 20 people were protesting two schools' team names: the
Indians at Fullerton High and Zapata's Raiders at Sonora High, whose
mascot--a mustachioed man in a sombrero and bandoleers--is supposed
to represent Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata.</LD>
<LD>   Police arrested Leti Rodriguez, 31, of Huntington Park as she
stood in a doorway to the board room. As she was led away in
handcuffs, other protesters taunted police, accusing them of
manhandling her and demanding that she be released.</LD>
<TE>   Before the Fullerton Union High School District meeting began,
Rodriguez reiterated that her group objects to "the use of indigenous
mascots. They disrespect our heritage and culture but think they're
honoring us. They don't understand the importance of Zapata. The
mascot should be done away with."</TE>
<TE>   Her arrest did not disrupt the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   At a break after the incident, board President Bob Singer said of
the mascot issue:</TE>
<TE>   "These decisions are made at the schools. We have tried to
encourage people in the community to consider all points of view. We
rely on our students and alumni to make these decisions."</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton High has had the same mascot for more than 100 years, he
said, and Sonora for about 35.</TE>
<TE>   Rusty Kennedy of the Orange County Human Rights Commission was
present at the school board meeting to speak on another issue.
"People feel very strongly about the [mascot] issue," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They have come here trying to raise that issue and have got- ten
frustrated. It's too bad they had to get into a conflict with the
police."</TE>
<TE>   Native American activists in California have been fighting for
more than 30 years to rid schools of the stereotypical Indian mascots
they find offensive.</TE>
<TE>   The Assembly considered legislation this year that would have made
California the first state to ban Native American team mascots from
public schools.</TE>
<TE>   The bill was defeated last month amid opposition from Republicans
and some Democrats who called it an example of excessive political
correctness.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los Angeles), who sponsored the
legislation, called it "a bill whose time has come" and told her
colleagues, "For too long, we have tolerated racial insensitivity" in
mascots.</TE>

<HD>Mental Health Funds for Youths in Jeopardy</HD>
<DH>Special education: State wants counties to pay bulk of
program costs. A bill on governor's desk could decide the issue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Penny Sylvester describes her autistic son as a "little professor."
The 12-year-old boy is highly intelligent but does not know how to
interact with others.</LD>
<LD>   For the last 2 1/2 years, a therapist contracted by the Los
Angeles County Department of Mental Health--and paid with state
funds--had worked with the boy at his school in Agoura Hills. In that
time, the boy learned to open up to his classmates and teachers.</LD>
<LD>   But a recent debate over who should pay for the bulk of such
services--the county or the state--has jeopardized such psychological
care for special education youngsters and put new burdens on their
families.</LD>
<TE>   County officials, whose governments are financially strapped with
other problems, believe the state should foot the bill, as it has for
18 years. But a recent audit by the state controller's office
contends that counties should pay for 90% of the services. The spat
could affect reimbursement going back a year.</TE>
<TE>   With its cash flow uncertain, the agency that had been providing
Sylvester's son with help withdrew its services May 24. Stirling
Behavioral Health Institute was the only provider of the program for
Las Virgenes Unified School District, in Calabasas and Agoura Hills.
Now, 107 children must look for mental health care elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "One has to understand the emotional needs these children have,"
said Peggy Woodall, a school district official who is helping search
for alternatives. "I shudder to think what could happen."</TE>
<TE>   Stirling is an extreme case, believed to be the only agency in the
state to have withdrawn such services. But many mental health-care
providers for the 27,645 California children who use the program,
generally known as "3632" after the Assembly Bill that funded it in
1984, said they too may have to cut services if they are not
guaranteed reimbursement.</TE>
<TE>   The providers also suggested that the state could be vulnerable to
lawsuits since federal law mandates free mental health services as
part of national programs for special education children.</TE>
<TE>   Stirling officials said they regret the cuts but had no
alternatives if they wanted to remain in business.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very difficult," said Iraj Broomand, Stirling's executive
director. "We have a commitment to serving these kids and hopefully
something is going to change."</TE>
<TE>   A solution may rest with a bill that was approved last week by the
state Legislature and now is being reviewed by the governor. The bill
would place full financial responsibility on the state's general
fund. Gov. Gray Davis has not yet taken a position on the bill,
according to his office.</TE>
<TE>   When the program was established, 90% of its costs were covered
under a state fund for community mental health programs and 10% of
the expenses were paid out of the state's general fund. But the
community mental health fund was eliminated in 1991 and never
replaced. For the next 11 years, most counties were fully reimbursed
from the state's general fund.</TE>
<TE>   But in a recent audit, the state controller's office advocated
that state spending on the services be restricted to 10% and that
counties pick up the rest. That would create more strain for, among
others, Los Angeles County, which recently recommended the closure of
several of its health facilities.</TE>
<TE>   As the debate continued, mental health advocates lobbied for last
week's bill and garnered an approval by the Legislature's budget
conference committee to pay $60 million to the counties for
outstanding services, going back to last July. The figure is still
$35 million short of last year's total costs. Nevertheless,
proponents call it a step in the right direction.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute comes amid a $24-billion state budget deficit that is
reducing other health services for children.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County has the largest 3632 program in California,
with 9,000 children, costing the state $22 million last year.
Two-thirds of the county's services are provided by private agencies
that are working without guarantees of payment.</TE>
<TE>   "It really puts a nonprofit organization in a risky situation,"
said Elizabeth Pfromm, executive director of Los Angeles Child
Guidance Clinic, which provides mental health care. "We don't want to
turn the kids away because we're part of the community."</TE>
<TE>   Services remain for nearly 1,000 children in Los Angeles Unified
School District. But some agencies are putting new referrals on a
waiting list, said Rene Gonzalez, director of psychological services
for the district.</TE>
<TE>   Stirling, which has 380 clients with mental health problems such
as depression and attention deficit disorder, laid off seven staff
members and may close a clinic in Van Nuys. Children in the program
are being referred to other clinics and agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Some employees, such as Bobbie Johnson, the therapist for
Sylvester's son, left because there was no guarantee of being paid.</TE>
<TE>   "I had two weeks to say goodbye to kids I've been working with for
two to three years," Johnson said. "That's very disruptive and can
cause serious problems for the children."</TE>
<TE>   Sylvester, who asked that her son's name not be used, said she is
worried about the financial burden, but has begun to pay Johnson
out-of-pocket for visits at home. "I'm not going to bounce my child
around," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento), who played a strong
role in pushing the bill, said: "These are some of our most
vulnerable children. They shouldn't be caught in a funding dispute."</TE>

<LD>Yolanda Benitez has a bag of money and she's trying to figure out
what to do with it. She may not be Santa Claus, but for the next
three years she'll be an official good Samaritan.</LD>
<LD>   The community activist and superintendent of the Rio School
District in Oxnard has been appointed to a statewide board charged
with distributing nearly $5 million in grant money to serve limited-
and non-English-speaking communities throughout California.</LD>
<LD>   The money is part of a 1998 settlement between Verizon, formerly
GTE, and the Public Utilities Commission. It resulted from a claim
against GTE over abusive marketing practices directed at
non-English-speaking customers charged for optional services they did
not order.</LD>
<TE>   A PUC investigation found the abuses had occurred sporadically
since 1989. In addition to repaying those customers, GTE was ordered
to pay $4.85 million to the commission's Telecommunications Consumer
Protection Fund.</TE>
<TE>   That money is designated for telecommunications education and
consumer protection in Verizon service areas.</TE>
<TE>   That's where Benitez and the other four board members--based in
Los Angeles, San Bernardino and San Francisco--come in. The board
members were recommended by the Greenlining Institute, an advocacy
organization that was a party to the suit against GTE.</TE>
<TE>   "The purpose is to fund telecommunications consumer education and
advocacy for non-English speakers," Benitez said.</TE>
<TE>   The educator wants nonprofit organizations and Latino community
groups to contact her with suggestions on use of the money.</TE>
<TE>   "Who has a great idea out there?" she asked. "What I want to hear
are ideas, and they will start becoming our parameters. As I see what
they're thinking, it gives me more ideas."</TE>
<TE>   The board won't create any programs itself; its purpose is to dole
out the money to nonprofit groups for their programs. But when
Benitez joined the board in December, she already had some thoughts
on where the money should go.</TE>
<TE>   "We have elderly Latinos in this county who still don't have a
telephone. They don't have that basic lifeline," she said. "I would
love for a nonprofit to put up a grant application for that."</TE>
<TE>   Computer literacy for Latino adults, especially parents, is
another area that Benitez would like to see receive funding.
"Technology is no longer a luxury, it's a necessity," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Board President Pastor Herrera of Los Angeles said he and his
board colleagues should be as open-minded as possible concerning
grant applications.</TE>
<TE>   "Telecommunications is such a dynamic area, with so many new
products and new technology," Herrera said. "This is a good
opportunity to have some creative proposals and get interesting ideas
to see how non- and limited-English-speaking communities can be
educated."</TE>
<TE>   Board members hope to begin interviews for a fund administrator by
mid-July. Several months later, grant applications are expected to be
available for nonprofit groups and community organizations.</TE>
<TE>   "Once the application is out, we will hold a meeting with
nonprofits, to walk them through the grant process," Benitez said.
"We want really grass-roots groups, and they don't have fancy grant
writers."</TE>
<TE>   The board will distribute about $1.6 million annually. Because the
money will be distributed through a competitive grant process,
Benitez is trying to drum up interest in Ventura, Santa Barbara and
San Luis Obispo counties.</TE>

programs to benefit non-English speakers, can be reached at P.O. Box

<HD>Frank X.Ogasawara, 88; Leading Poultry Scientist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frank X. Ogasawara, one of the world's leading poultry scientists
whose pioneer studies in avian reproduction helped create the
plumper, meatier turkeys that grace the nation's tables on
Thanksgiving, has died. He was 88.</LD>
<LD>   Ogasawara, professor emeritus of avian and animal sciences at UC
Davis, died June 8 of postoperative complications in a hospital in
Davis.</LD>
<LD>   Ogasawara's most important work in avian sciences was in sperm
physiology and fertilization, particularly with the technique of
artificial insemination.</LD>
<TE>   "He was internationally recognized in his field of avian
physiology, largely reproductive physiology," said Howard Kratzer, a
former professor of avian sciences at UC Davis. "He identified sperm
nests, or storage sites, for semen in the oviduct of turkey hens,
which explains the long period of fertility after a single mating.</TE>
<TE>   "He also did extensive work in developing methods for freezing
[turkey] semen so it can be stored for long periods."</TE>
<TE>   Kratzer added that Ogasawara "worked with the reproduction of many
species, which is important as a means of improving the chances of
survival of endangered species and possibly of preserving genetic
material."</TE>
<TE>   In the 1950s, in response to consumer demand for larger,
fuller-breasted turkeys, breeders began selecting only the largest
birds for breeding.</TE>
<TE>   To the joy of turkey lovers, the birds that began arriving in
supermarkets were more than double in size. But there was a price to
pay for the meaty, heavy-chested turkeys: The male, or "tom," turkeys
became so heavy and clumsy that they had great difficulty mating with
the much smaller hens.</TE>
<TE>   The solution to the turkey breeders' dilemma came with artificial
insemination.</TE>
<TE>   As pioneers of studying the technique in poultry in California,
Ogasawara and his UC Davis colleague Fred Lorenz shared their
knowledge with the state's turkey breeders, who embraced the method.</TE>
<TE>   In time, so did turkey breeders across the country, and today,
virtually every turkey is bred by artificial insemination.</TE>
<TE>   Artificial insemination has led to even larger turkeys: An average
1-month-old turkey weighs a tad over 2 pounds, which is nearly three
times the weight of the same bird in the 1920s.</TE>
<TE>   "This technique really saved the turkey industry," Francine
Bradley, a UC Davis avian scientist, told the San Francisco Weekly in
1996.</TE>
<TE>   "With [artificial insemination], the industry has been very
effective in producing a big, efficient bird."</TE>
<TE>   Lorenz, former chairman of UC Davis' department of animal
physiology, said Monday that after he and Ogasawara worked together,
"Frank went on by himself and made some very important contributions
to the whole field of avian reproduction."</TE>
<TE>   In 1966, Ogasawara was awarded the National Turkey Federation's
Outstanding Research Award for pioneering studies in avian artificial
insemination.</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego-born Ogasawara spent most of his childhood in Battle
Mountain, Nev. He earned his undergraduate degree from UC Berkeley in
1949, and in 1957 he earned his doctorate from UC Davis, where he was
appointed an assistant professor a year later.</TE>
<TE>   Ogasawara, who retired as a full professor in 1983, wrote more
than 80 published articles and shared his expertise widely, including
lecturing in Japan, Scotland, Brazil and China.</TE>
<TE>   A 1970 article he wrote for National Geographic chronicled his
visit to Japan on a National Geographic Society grant to study
varieties of the Japanese Onagadori, a long-tailed fowl that evolved
from the common domestic chicken. (The roosters grow tail feathers
that may exceed 30 feet in length.)</TE>
<TE>   In 1972, after one of his graduate students found an orphaned
Swainson's hawk, Ogasawara founded the California Raptor Center at UC
Davis, which rehabilitates injured and orphaned birds of prey.</TE>
<TE>   About 60% of the about 250 raptors the center receives each year
are returned to the wild.</TE>
<TE>   The center uses the birds that cannot live on their own to educate
hundreds of schoolchildren who visit the center on field trips each
year, as well as the university's veterinary and zoology students.</TE>
<TE>   Ogasawara, who earned the Poultry Science Assn.'s Ralston Purina
Outstanding Teacher Award in 1976, served as chairman of the USDA's
national turkey research committee from 1978 to 1979.</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, he was one of five distinguished North American poultry
scientists who were granted the highest honor of the Fellow of the
Poultry Science Assn., in recognition of 25 years of outstanding
research and teaching contributions to the American and international
poultry industries.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, he was made an honorary member of the Japan Zootechnical
Society.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife of 57 years, Kay; two daughters, Pam of
Urbana, Md., and Patty Sanui of Sacramento; and a son, Paul of
Sebastopol.</TE>

<HD>Tinseltown Laying Claim Not Only to Hollywood Sign, But
Union Station Too?</HD>

<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's bad enough that the Hollywood secessionists want to take the
Hollywood sign away from L.A. But now Cecil Wiggins of La Canada has
forwarded evidence from Trains magazine that Tinseltown is also
claiming a downtown L.A. landmark (see photo). One more reason to
derail the secessionists, I say.</LD>
<LD>   Let's hope they didn't come up with that number on a cash
register: Sheldon McClusky, Chuck Collazzi and several other readers
pointed out that the 99 Cents Only chain had a bit of trouble adding
figures in a congratulatory Lakers ad (see accompanying).</LD>
<LD>   They were short by three, which happens to be the number of the
Lakers' Devean George. But the Lakers didn't use George all that much
during the season, either.</LD>
<TE>   Turning to other sports: Leo Jasay came across a shrimp that
should be on the wrestling channel (see accompanying). It appears the
critter is looking for the limelight too.</TE>
<TE>   So those weren't rats scampering overhead! The Laguna News-Post
carried a resident's alert to police about "several transients who
appeared to be living on the roof" of a tire business. The newspaper
said, "He told police that he noticed that they slept on the roof
until late in the afternoon."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of tires: Have you seen that billboard for a luxury car
that says: "On the menu--asphalt flambe"? I guess it's supposed to
mean that the sleek coupe really burns up the roads. But the first
thing I thought about when I saw "asphalt flambe" was disintegrating
tires.</TE>
<TE>   "Duh!" Award winner: Robert Weibezahl of Westlake Village noticed
this shocking headline in a Valley newspaper: "Deputies on Beach
Patrol Find Summer the Busiest Time of Year."</TE>
<TE>   Oh, nuts: "Let's face it, the highly publicized rankings of
colleges and universities, such as those in U.S. News and World
Report, use suspect criteria and are, well, for the birds," began the
note from Vince Cuseo.</TE>
<TE>   Cuseo agrees with the position of the Campus Squirrel Listings'
Web site that there is a correlation between the quality of learning
at a college and the health of its resident squirrels.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Cuseo is also the director of admissions at Occidental
College, which bagged a rating of four squirrels compared with three
for its much-larger neighbor, UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Oxy was praised for "bushy-tailed critters" while UCLA's were
characterized as "underfed" and "mangy" on the Web site (www.
gottshall.com/squirrels/campsq. htm).</TE>
<TE>   Caltech, by the way, received a rating of just two, because of a
virtual absence of squirrels. Maybe the creatures fear they might be
subjected to experiments by the practical joke-loving students.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: No wonder postal rates keep going up. The Seal Beach
Sun said a man "tried to buy stamps from a machine inside a lobby."</TE>
<TE>   "When the machine would not accept his dollar, it gave him $35
worth of stamps."</TE>
<TE>   And what did he do? Why, he "turned in the stamps to the police."
Just like you or I would have done, right?</TE>

<HD>What Irvine Really Lacks Is a Sense of Irony</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Northern Sphere sounds like a restricted area where the
government might be investigating extraterrestrials. Instead, it's a
large tract of unincorporated land that Irvine plans to annex as the
future site of more than 12,000 homes, which will complete the city's
grand design for itself over the next 20 years.</LD>
<LD>   City Hall and the Irvine Co. think the Northern Sphere should be
celebrated as another master stroke of planning. They are irked that
a small group of citizens--who just happened to serve on a task force
that studied the project intimately--have rained on their parade by
saying publicly that the project is too big for Irvine.</LD>
<LD>   Methinks the council has no sense of irony.</LD>
<TE>   Isn't this The Little City That Could? Isn't this the city that,
in the face of two countywide votes in the 1990s approving an
international airport, led the fight to undo the whole thing? Isn't
this the city that begged for people to take another look--and then
another and another--at the potential effect of an airport on the
local scene? And when lots of people touted the inevitability and
eminent sense of a new airport and lamented that the issue had been
studied to death, didn't the city stand strong and ask for more time?</TE>
<TE>   The answer to those questions is obvious, and I don't hear the
band of Northern Sphere questioners arguing any differently than City
Hall once did over the airport. True, an airport is not a housing
development, but the loyal opposition to the Northern Sphere project
is merely asking for more time.</TE>
<TE>   At least, it was. The City Council has settled the matter and
approved the project, and the only intrigue is why its supporters
seem so indignant at the protests over it.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Larry Agran, the original back-bencher, says that the
"overwhelming" majority of city residents supports the project. When
I asked if, once upon a time, he wouldn't have been the person
raising questions about a project of this scope, he replied: "No."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor continued: "I always in the end voted yes, even on some
of the most expansive development projects. My goal always was to
secure maximum public benefits in conjunction with any private
benefits we were conferring on the Irvine Co. or other developers."</TE>
<TE>   Clearly miffed that the media have given the anti-Northern Sphere
group as much ink as it has gotten in recent days, Agran says of the
project: "Rather than it being a hurried process, it has been a
protracted and thorough process, by design."</TE>
<TE>   He points to the 55 meetings open to the public on the subject
over the last couple years. Many of those were the task-force
meetings, but others, he says, were more conventional "town hall"
settings.</TE>
<TE>   Agran argues that if widespread opposition to the plan existed in
Irvine, it would have surfaced. I can't disprove that but question
whether in the face of the decade-long anti-El Toro airport fight,
Irvine citizens focused on the Northern Sphere.</TE>
<TE>   I talked to two citizen members of the task force. Neither wants
to junk the Northern Sphere plan. They question only its size and
whether Irvine residents really grasp what it will mean.</TE>
<TE>   "The seven of us who were on the task force have just given up,
saying we can't fight City Hall," Richard Deskin says. "Our basic
gripe is that we don't mind the project, we just think it's
overdeveloped."</TE>
<TE>   As a personal matter, it's of no-nevermind whether the Irvine Co.
builds out Northern Sphere. I just find it curious that the demurring
of a group of citizens--especially a group that knows it well--is
incurring such wrath.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Agran says it's just that--a group of citizens not
reflective of the city.</TE>
<TE>   That's what El Toro airport advocates once said of their
opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't see how big this beast is that's going to be in
their backyard," says Deskin of the proposed development.</TE>
<TE>   Even as I can imagine him shaking his head in disagreement over
that statement, I swear I hear echoes of it in Larry Agran, once upon
a time talking about an airport.</TE>

<HD>Stanley Chaloupka, 80; Former First Harpist of L.A.
Philharmonic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stanley Chaloupka, 80, first harpist for the Los Angeles Philharmonic
from 1943 to 1983, died Friday at Glendale Memorial Hospital of
causes linked to aging.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Oakland and raised in Gilroy, Calif., Chaloupka said he
"became entranced" by a harp concert when he was 8. Two years later,
his father began driving him 69 miles each way to take harp lessons
in San Francisco. By age 16, the youth was playing with the San
Francisco Opera and Civic Light Opera orchestras.</LD>
<LD>   After moving to Los Angeles, the young man was hired by the Los
Angeles Philharmonic as first harpist in 1943. His late wife, Paula,
was second harpist for many years, and the two performed concerts
together. A Times reviewer noted after one duet recital in 1952 that
"the ensemble playing of the pair was indeed flawless.... One would
be hard put to decide who of the two plays better."</LD>
<TE>   Chaloupka told The Times in 1961 that handling the 100-pound harps
could be difficult. "Harps are fickle. We spend hours tuning them,"
he said. "It's like driving a Model T: You've got to have brains in
your feet."</TE>

<LD>Thank you, Mr. President. Have you recovered from jet lag from your
trip to Europe?</LD>
<LD>   Bush: You know, like they say in espanol, asi asi.</LD>
<LD>   I just got back from Europe myself, and I'm feeling about the
same: comme-ci, comme-ca, as the French say.</LD>
<TE>   Bush: Well, now there you go getting all intercontinental again.
What is with you people? Don't you know what'll happen if you keep
talking that way? Pretty soon Americans are gonna get ideas! They're
gonna be wanting a month of vacation! They're gonna start eating cow
innards! They're gonna drink wine at lunch! They're gonna have sex in
the daytime!</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I left Paris just as President Bush was heading there on his
European tour, and I watched from the safer distance of England as
Bush blew into town, and then blew up. At a press conference, an
American reporter asked French President Jacques Chirac a question in
French, and Bush got all shirty. "Very good," he snapped
sarcastically. "The guy memorizes four words and he plays like he's
intercontinental. I'm impressed. Que bueno. Now I'm literate in two
languages."</TE>
<TE>   President Bush is not one to mock anybody's stabs at bilingualism.
He has used Spanish to political advantage, with a skill said to fall
somewhere between Peace Corps and patron-grade Spanish. Not that
skill matters; it's the thought that counts. Look at JFK, who, when
he said "Ich bin ein Berliner," was really inadvertently saying, "I
am a jelly doughnut"--but the Berliners loved him for it anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Many Americans of the chattering class took this presidential
hissy-fit as more evidence of George Bush the Backwater Boy, who said
with evident astonishment to the president of famously multiracial
Brazil, "Do you have blacks too?"</TE>
<TE>   But there was more to it than that. Bush wasn't just being Bush,
the fellow who talked about Greeks as "Grecians" and believes that
subject-verb agreement makes one's manhood suspect. He was being
quintessentially American.</TE>
<TE>   Americans are the world's luckiest teenagers with the best car,
the fattest allowance and the biggest line of brag, yet like all
teenagers we're secretly afraid that someone is laughing at us.
Here's a news flash. They are. Our cowboy Puritanism dumbfounds the
rest of the world. We execute teenagers, we impeach a president over
a sex act, we want to ban soda pop from schools to protect children
at the same time we practically sell guns in vending machines.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Just before I left for Europe-- "Yurrup," as I think Mark Twain
had it coming out of his countrymen's mouths--I spoke to the press
attaches with some of the foreign consulates in Southern California.
They wondered just why it is that their countries--big, venerable
nations--don't get much coverage in America's news media, and what
they do get, especially on TV, more often than not begins with a
phrase like, "In a move that may affect U.S. interests ..."</TE>
<TE>   I made our excuses. This is a huge country. It is almost as far
from L.A. to New York as it is from London to Kabul. We are padded
out east and west with two enormous oceans, and to the north and
south with two vast, friendly countries, one of which speaks the same
language we do. No wonder only one American in five holds a passport,
and probably no more than that speak another language with any
fluency. Americans can go their whole lives without meeting a
foreigner, except maybe the busboy.</TE>
<TE>   But I also explained that we have no history of empire to bind us
to the broader world. News from Africa and Vietnam is big in France
because France had imperial stakes there. India and Pakistan make
headlines in Britain because the flag of empire advanced there.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the U.S. practices Pops Americana , a soft-sell virtual
empire of culture, burgers, movies, jeans and slang. Ronald Reagan
genuinely believed if the rest of the world was safe for big-screen
TVs and gold MasterCards, everyone would be just like us, and
thrilled to be so.</TE>
<TE>   So the world manages to envy us even as it mocks us. In a column
last week, the Guardian, Britain's leftist newspaper, enumerated our
deficiencies, then listed "fifty ways to love America," from walk-in
closets and the 1st Amendment to Trader Joe's chocolate-covered
pretzels.</TE>
<TE>   Pops Americana  is one reason "they" hate us, in all those
sinister and unpronounceable places on the world's map, and one
reason why we now find ourselves on the crash-course terrorism tour
of the world, learning about places like Kabul and Kandahar, and,
like our other tours of places with names like Normandy and Saigon,
we risk once again making the mistake of coming home from "over
there" convinced that the great world is full not of intriguingly
different places, but only perilous ones.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thank you again, President Bush. At the risk of being called an
intercontinental, may I wish you bon voyage on your next foreign
trip. Oh, and as for eating cow innards--we already do. In these
parts, it's called menudo.</TE>

<LD>The U.S. Forest Service grounded all seven of its C-130 firefighting
planes Tuesday after the wings snapped off one of the four-engine
aircraft as it was battling a blaze in the High Sierra.</LD>
<LD>   All three crewmen aboard the 45-year-old air tanker were killed
Monday when it slammed in flames into a field near Walker, Calif.,
about 25 miles north of Yosemite National Park.</LD>
<LD>   They were identified Tuesday as pilot Steven Wass, 42, of
Gardnerville, Nev.; co-pilot Craig Labare, 36, of Loomis, Calif.; and
crewman Michael Davis, 59, of Bakersfield.</LD>
<TE>   A National Transportation Safety Board team based in Los Angeles
flew to the crash site Tuesday to determine how the accident
occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Videotape filmed by an amateur shows that the wings snapped upward
simultaneously as the plane descended in what appeared to be a
normal, shallow dive after dumping fire retardant.</TE>
<TE>   Flames are visible as the wings come off, but it is not clear
whether the fire on the plane started before the wings came off or at
the moment of separation.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the loads they carry, wings are usually the strongest
structures in a plane, and veteran aviators said wing failures are
rare.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen anything like that," said Barry Schiff, a retired
TWA pilot and aviation safety consultant.</TE>
<TE>   "It was shocking," said Rep. Jim Gibbons, a Nevada Republican and
former Air Force pilot who spent about 1,000 hours behind the
controls of C-130s during the Vietnam and Persian Gulf wars. "Before
you let other planes that are models like that one fly again, you
want to inspect them."</TE>
<TE>   More than 2,000 C-130s have been built by Lockheed since 1954. The
bottle-nosed turboprop transport planes earned a reputation for
rugged dependability in Vietnam and the Persian Gulf.</TE>
<TE>   Nicknamed the Hercules, the plane has become a mainstay in the
nation's aerial firefighting fleet, and five of the seven under
contract with the Forest Service were being used when the accident
occurred.</TE>
<TE>   The aircraft that crashed was being leased from Hawkins and Powers
Aviation Inc. in Greybull, Wyo.</TE>
<TE>   "They are tough machines," Schiff said. "But they fly in
tooth-shattering turbulence, and they take a hell of a beating. Over
the long haul, you could have failure due to metal fatigue. If the
center wing box failed, it's certainly possible that both the wings
could come off."</TE>
<TE>   Schiff said the videotape did not seem to show that the plane was
going through any unusually stressful maneuvers when the wings
snapped off. "But if it was ready to go, it was ready to go," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The plane had undergone repairs to fix wing cracks in 1998, a
representative for the plane's owner said Tuesday. But whether such
surface flaws might have led to major structural failure is unknown.</TE>
<TE>   The plane was built in 1957 and delivered to the Air Force that
year. It was a C-130A, one of the first in a series of production
models than ran all the way through the C-130H.</TE>
<TE>   While most were used as transports, some were converted for
specialized missions that included refueling rescue helicopters,
jamming enemy electronics systems and serving as aerial gun
platforms.</TE>
<TE>   Because of their durability, some of the planes have been used for
meteorological studies while flying through full-strength hurricanes.</TE>
<TE>   The 10,000-acre fire that the C-130A was battling erupted Saturday
in Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest, an area used by Marines for
survival training. Fire officials said the blaze was human-caused,
but declined to give further details.</TE>
<TE>   One home, a garage and a trailer burned, but winds had shifted by
Tuesday, and most of the evacuees were able to return to their homes.</TE>
<TE>   By Tuesday night, the wildfire was burning away from occupied
areas. Officials said they hoped to contain the blaze by early next
week.</TE>

<HD>Hospital Workers Launch 4-Day Strike</HD>
<DH>Labor: The pickets are protesting pay and staffing levels
at Queen of Angels facility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NERISSA PACIO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About 300 health care employees and community members protesting low
wages and understaffed crews at Queen of Angels-Hollywood
Presbyterian Medical Center launched a four-day strike Tuesday, the
second walkout in three weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Nurses, respiratory therapists, lab technicians and supporters
from Service Employees International Union, Local 399 gathered in
front of the hospital Tuesday morning, holding "On Strike for Safe
Staffing" signs. But the protesters quickly disbanded after
television news cameras left.</LD>
<LD>   Hospital administrators said 140 employees out of 1,200 walked out
Tuesday and will return to work Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   Union representatives said their biggest concern is a staffing
shortage, which they said endangers patients' lives.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes we'll only have one nurse for eight patients," said
Tessie Fajilan, a registered nurse in the pediatric unit who has
worked at the hospital for 21 years. "Babies will be screaming while
the only nurse is on the phone or giving another patient his meds."</TE>
<TE>   "We're all human beings," said Rith Chhun, a neonatal respiratory
therapist who has worked at the hospital for five years.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no respect or dignity here," Chhun said. "When we work
these hours our acuity level and decision-making skills deteriorate."</TE>
<TE>   Administrators at the 434-bed medical center said it abides by
state staffing requirements, which, until they are expanded next
year, are mandated only for critical care and neonatal units.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the hospital has increased its recruiting efforts and has
flown in out-of-state staff to cover the striking employees, said
Julie Jatico, director of the hospital emergency room.</TE>
<TE>   "Every hospital is going through a nursing shortage in
California," said David Langness, spokesman for Tenet HealthSystem,
which owns Queen of Angels and is the country's second-largest
commercial hospital chain. "There's intensive competition for nurses
out of nursing school."</TE>
<TE>   After the union's contract expired May 13, members voted to reject
the hospital's last offer of an 11% pay increase over three years and
more health benefit subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   Union representatives are asking for a 7% increase for a one-year
contract and a more affordable health insurance package.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, the hospital suspended 17 nurses who called in sick
the day before the first walkout.</TE>
<TE>   The union has filed charges with the National Labor Relations
Board against the hospital for retaliation and intimidation.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the nurses have since resigned and the case is pending,
said Gregory Monette, a hospital spokesman.</TE>

<HD>Suspect in Razor Case Describes Lonely Life</HD>
<DH>Interview: Lori Elizabeth Fischer, 21, of Mission Viejo,
accused of placing sharp items in parks, says from jail that she
found solace walking at night.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 21-year-old Mission Viejo woman accused of planting sharp objects
at parks described herself Tuesday as an outsider who never fit in
with life in suburban south Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   In a jailhouse interview, Lori Elizabeth Fischer declined to say
if she was responsible for placing razor blades and nails at 10 parks
in April and May. She described herself as an alienated person who
often found solace walking alone through parks near her house late at
night.</LD>
<LD>   "I relax at night," she said. "During the day, there's too many
people and their dogs. At night, I think about a lot of things. A lot
of things run through my mind."</LD>
<TE>   Authorities allege that Fischer sprinkled dozens of sharp objects
in sandboxes, under slides and in the grass of parks during these
outings. No one was injured, but the incidents frightened residents
and prompted sheriff's deputies to sweep hundreds of parks and
schools in search of razor blades.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities allege that before many of the incidents, Fischer
called police from pay phones--sometimes using the name "Danni"--to
warn them of cities about to be targeted. She allegedly kept
newspaper clippings of the discoveries and filled a thick journal
with musings and poems about the razor-blade incidents.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's detectives arrested Fischer on June 4 after following
her for a week. Officials said she was taken into custody after
placing nails at a Mission Viejo park.</TE>
<TE>   Fischer, dressed in a blue jail jumpsuit, said Tuesday that she
suspected she was being followed when she saw two unmarked police
cars circling her car outside a friend's house.</TE>
<TE>   As for the phone calls to police, Fischer said she wanted to help
by providing leads on where the alleged culprit would strike next.
She would not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Fischer said she and her parents moved from Plano, Texas, to
Mission Viejo when she was 8. She holds fond memories of Texas: "It
was nice growing up there. I had a dog and friends."</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo was another story.</TE>
<TE>   She said she became isolated when attending Carl H. Hankey
Elementary School in Mission Viejo--one of the greenbelts where eight
nails were discovered.</TE>
<TE>   "When I moved here, I was the new kid on the block," Fischer said.
"Everyone had friends and cliques, and I didn't fit into any of
them." She said her isolation continued in high school.</TE>
<TE>   Fischer said she holds no ill will toward children, noting that
she earned extra money as a baby-sitter.</TE>
<TE>   Fischer is being held at the Orange County Central Women's Jail in
Santa Ana on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and child
endangerment. She will be arraigned Friday.</TE>

<LD>An organic dairy farm and producer are suing the California
Department of Food and Agriculture, saying that state fees imposed on
dairy processors are unfair to organic milk producers.</LD>
<LD>   Straus Family Creamery, a family-owned farm in Marshall, and
Horizon Organic Holding Corp. of Boulder, Colo., argue in their
federal lawsuit that the state is forcing them to subsidize producers
of conventional milk. All California dairy producers are required to
contribute fees to a pool designed to ensure stable income for milk
producers, they said.</LD>
<LD>   The California Milk Stabilization and Pooling Plans don't take
into account the fact that it costs more to produce organic milk,
Horizon and Straus said.</LD>

<HD>Charter School's Funding in Peril</HD>
<DH>Education: Antelope Valley campus fails to meet teacher
salary guidelines, might have overstated attendance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A charter school in the Antelope Valley may have its public funding
revoked today by a school district that suspects it has been
overstating its attendance and receiving state funding it doesn't
deserve.</LD>
<LD>   Antelope Valley Union High School District Supt. Robert Girolamo
is recommending that the school board refuse to renew the charter of
year-old Desert Sands Charter School at tonight's board meeting.
Desert Sands is a for-profit school that specializes in home-study
programs for students who have struggled in traditional classroom
settings.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to attendance concerns, the district staff believes
the school hired inexperienced employees, misused education funds on
lawsuits, and generally offered "an unsound educational program,"
according to Christopher Keeler, the school district's lawyer.</LD>
<TE>   Michael Finley, Desert Sands' lawyer, said the school, which has
campuses in Lancaster and Palmdale, has succeeded in its goal of
serving at-risk students. "Teachers and parents are thrilled with the
program," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The district's recommendation comes amid growing concerns that the
state lacks sufficient oversight over charter schools that use
taxpayer money for home-study programs. Legislators worry that too
little money is being spent on instruction at some of these schools,
which, like all charters, are allowed to operate as for-profit
businesses under California law.</TE>
<TE>   In March, state education officials acting on a new state law
slashed the funding for independent-study charter schools if they
didn't spend at least half their public revenue on certified teacher
salaries.</TE>
<TE>   More than 50 of the state's 118 independent-study schools had
their funding cut by 5% this year.</TE>
<TE>   In two years, cuts could be as much as 30%, said Jan Sterling,
state director of school fiscal services.</TE>
<TE>   Desert Sands, which spent 35% of its public funds on certified
teachers, was among the schools whose funding was cut, Sterling said.</TE>
<TE>   The district also has recommended that the school board approve an
independent auditor to review the school's reported average daily
attendance figures, which are used to calculate the amount of money
that schools receive from the state. The school's midyear report
already has been decertified by the district and the Los Angeles
County Office of Education.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Freise, district attendance coordinator, said the school may
have overstated its claim that it had an average daily attendance of
302 students at midyear. Based on those numbers, the state agreed to
pay the school about $1.6 million--about $5,300 per student--during
the school year, Freise said.</TE>
<TE>   Freise could not say how much the district believed the school
inflated its attendance, nor how much of the $1.6 million has already
been paid. The school has since grown to about 1,000 students, Finley
said.</TE>
<TE>   Finley believes the attendance issue arose over questions about a
handful of student records. Another Desert Sands attorney, Lisa Corr,
said the school welcomed the audit.</TE>
<TE>   The district will present its findings at tonight's meeting.</TE>

<HD>City Analyst Reviews Borough Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city's legislative analyst on Tuesday laid out a possible
structure for a borough system to govern Los Angeles, but the idea of
boroughs as an alternative to secession remained short of support at
City Hall.</LD>
<LD>   Ronald F. Deaton described a system that would divide the city
into seven boroughs of about 528,000 residents each. The boroughs
would be run by local councils that would either be elected by voters
or appointed by the Los Angeles City Council.</LD>
<LD>   Deaton offered his analysis as part of a review of a borough
proposal by Councilwoman Wendy Greuel. In his report to the council,
he said boroughs would "promote citizen participation in government
and make government more responsive to local needs."</LD>
<TE>   Greuel and other borough supporters say putting such a proposal on
the Nov. 5 ballot may be the only way to save Los Angeles from a
civic breakup. Secession measures for the San Fernando Valley and
Hollywood are already on that ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The Deaton analysis could provide the beginnings of a compromise
between Greuel's proposal and a more detailed plan by Assemblyman Bob
Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks).</TE>
<TE>   The Greuel proposal calls for creation of a commission that would
draft a borough system within one year, then put it before voters for
approval. It would give some local decision-making power to borough
leaders, but leave the City Council intact to deal with broader
issues.</TE>
<TE>   Hertzberg wants voters to decide this year whether to launch a
nine-borough system that would replace the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very encouraged to see that Mr. Deaton, who has tremendous
understanding of the city and how it operates, sees that a borough
plan can work," Hertzberg said. "I think it's an important step
forward in the process."</TE>
<TE>   But it was not clear on Tuesday whether discussions on a
compromise have moved forward.</TE>
<TE>   The council's Committee on Education and Neighborhoods, which
heard a presentation on the Deaton analysis, did not take action on
Greuel's proposal. Instead, committee members asked detailed
questions about the process of setting up boroughs.</TE>
<TE>   So far, only five council members support Greuel's plan, leaving
it three votes short of the majority needed to place it on the
ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Mayor James K. Hahn has avoided commenting on either
borough plan.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of this is still in the formative stage," Deputy Mayor Matt
Middlebrook said. "When some of this stuff is more thought out, we
will have an opinion."</TE>
<TE>   Deaton pointed out that the mayor and City Council must decide
which powers they would willing to relinquish to boroughs and borough
leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Other issues to be addressed, Deaton said, include whether borough
representatives would be elected at-large or from separate districts
within the boroughs, whether the City Council could override borough
decisions and whether boroughs would comply with federal laws
requiring equal representation for ethnic minorities in electoral
districts.</TE>

<HD>El Segundo Voters Reaffirm Big Project</HD>
<DH>Election: Approval of two measures allows a 46-acre
development of office, hotel, retail and restaurant space to proceed.
City Council has already given OK.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a special referendum Tuesday, El Segundo residents reaffirmed the
City Council's approval of a 46-acre development project, according
to final vote totals.</LD>
<LD>   The two measures involving the plan's environmental impact report
and the project itself passed with 67% of the vote.</LD>
<LD>   The El Segundo Corporate Campus project calls for about 1.6
million square feet of office space, with hotel, retail and
restaurant development on land next to Nash Street near the Century
Freeway.</LD>
<TE>   In a unanimous vote in January, city leaders approved the proposal
by developer Thomas Properties, saying it would be an economic boon
for El Segundo and allow the city to purchase a much-needed playing
field at a lower price.</TE>
<TE>   But a group of residents called Citizens Against Gridlock in El
Segundo gathered enough signatures in March to force Tuesday's
election.</TE>
<TE>   Their major qualms have to do with traffic, safety and economics.</TE>
<TE>   They say some language in the project's fine print makes it
financially questionable for the city.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many things that Thomas says they'll give us that
aren't guaranteed," said Brian Crowley, chairman of Citizens Against
Gridlock.</TE>
<TE>   The group also sued the city, saying it failed to implement a
required traffic plan before approving the development.</TE>
<TE>   Kilroy Realty, which owns several buildings next to the site, has
spent about $460,000 to help Citizens Against Gridlock in its fight.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas has spent about $425,000 since January on its own campaign
for the development.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the referendum reaffirms the council's decision,
Thomas cannot move forward until the lawsuit is settled.</TE>

<HD>1st Simon TV Ad Is in Spanish; It Tackles Davis on
Education</HD>
<DH>Politics: GOP candidate says he's courting Latino vote. But
limited nature of the spot shows his relative lack of funds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial nominee Bill Simon Jr. launched his
television advertising campaign against Gov. Gray Davis on Tuesday
with a Spanish-language spot that challenges the incumbent's record
on education.</LD>
<LD>   Given the vast scale of TV advertising required to reach most
California voters, Simon's opening spot for the general election race
is extremely limited. It will air statewide, but only on Univision,
Telemundo and Galavision stations, and Simon campaign officials would
not say how much they planned to spend airing the ad.</LD>
<LD>   By contrast, the Democratic incumbent has been running an
extensive series of spots in English for more than two weeks on major
broadcast stations in Los Angeles and the Central Valley. Two of them
promote the governor, but another hammers Simon for his role in
managing a savings and loan that failed.</LD>
<TE>   Simon has not put up any ads to respond to Davis' attack. The lack
of a response from Simon, who is relatively unknown among California
voters, has stirred anxiety among some fellow Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   But on Tuesday, the GOP nominee released an ad that seeks to keep
the campaign's focus on Davis, and to do so with an issue that the
Simon campaign views as crucial for appealing to swing voters:
education. The commercial tells viewers in Spanish that Davis has
broken his promise to improve California schools.</TE>
<TE>   "Our children lose with Gray Davis," the narrator says.</TE>
<TE>   The ad concludes with Simon saying in Spanish: "The future of
California depends on our children--yours and mine."</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference in Santa Monica, Simon said he was
introducing himself to voters in Spanish "to highlight the priority
that I'm placing on the Latino community."</TE>
<TE>   "I know my ideas will resonate among them ... because I will not
take the Latino community for granted as Gray Davis has done these
last four years," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the ideas he listed as especially beneficial to Latino
business owners were a cut in the state's capital gains tax, a
rollback of state regulations and reform of the workers' compensation
system.</TE>
<TE>   In the Republican primary, Simon did not advertise in Spanish, and
he held few events aimed directly at Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   Davis strategist Garry South said Simon and other Republicans are
"frantic about trying to connect" with Latino voters, but predicted
that the governor would still win that voting bloc by an overwhelming
margin. South also dismissed the criticism of Davis on education as
an effort to divert attention from Simon's opposition to abortion
rights and gun control.</TE>
<TE>   "He claims that Gov. Davis is responsible for everything from
asthma to zits," South said.</TE>
<TE>   California Latinos have leaned strongly toward Democrats in recent
elections. In the 1998 race for governor, Davis won 71% of their
vote, leaving his GOP rival Dan Lungren with 23%, according to the
Times Poll. In the 2000 presidential election, Latinos in California
favored Democrat Al Gore over Republican George W. Bush by 75% to
23%, the poll found.</TE>
<TE>   But Republicans are counting on increased support among Latinos to
reverse the party's string of losses in statewide elections over the
last six years.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Carrick, a Democratic campaign strategist not involved in the
governor's race, said it was smart for Simon to advertise on
Spanish-language television.</TE>
<TE>   But Carrick added: "What I don't understand--it's a mystery to
me--is why he doesn't do something equally smart, which is to go on
English-language television and challenge what Gray Davis is saying
about him."</TE>
<TE>   "Davis can put Simon in a hole here that's very hard to dig out
of," Carrick said.</TE>
<TE>   Part of Simon's problem is that he is millions behind Davis in
fund-raising. With nearly five months until the Nov. 5 election,
Simon cannot sustain a major television ad campaign if he starts now.</TE>
<TE>   Among the risks of buying television time now: He could wind up
with little money in his war chest at the end of June, when the
campaign must prepare a report showing how much cash it has. That
number is eyed with great interest in donor circles; too small a
total and potential donors can lose confidence in a campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "They're just not in a position where they can burn a lot of money
on ads," said Bill Whalen, a research fellow at the Hoover
Institution.</TE>
<TE>   Though Simon strategist Sal Russo declined to say how much money
the campaign was spending on the Spanish-language ad, the cost would
be a small fraction of the several million dollars that the Davis
campaign says it is spending this month on TV spots.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Cain, director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at
UC Berkeley, said Simon's foray into Spanish-language media could
turn out to be a "brilliant strategy" if the governor's saving and
loan spot fails to convince voters that Simon is unqualified to run
the state.</TE>
<TE>   "It would basically mean the Simon campaign has enough discipline
not to get drawn into a war of attrition when they don't have the
resources to match Davis," Cain said.</TE>
<TE>   But the Simon team is still taking a risk that the S&amp;L ad will
erode support for the Republican nominee, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't like to leave charges unanswered," he said. "But if
nobody's paying attention, or for whatever reason it's not
registering with voters, then there's no reason to respond."</TE>
<TE>   The Simon ad will also air on the Radio Unica and Nueva Vida radio
networks.</TE>

<HD>County Keeps Budget Options Open</HD>
<DH>Shortfall: Supervisors defy critics, agreeing to consider
redirecting tobacco settlement and public safety funds if state cuts
are too drastic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite heated opposition, Ventura County supervisors said Tuesday
they may tap into tobacco settlement dollars and warned public safety
managers that their budgets may be further trimmed if cuts in state
funding prove as catastrophic as feared.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors said they must consider those drastic steps as they
await the outcome of negotiations over the state's own bleak
financial picture.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County government stands to lose up to $26 million in
state funding, reductions that would close health clinics and gut
other services unless stopgap funding is identified, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Those cuts would come on top of $17.6 million in reductions that
supervisors approved Tuesday in adopting a $1.2-billion 2002-03
budget. The spending plan calls for nearly all county departments to
shave jobs and services, including a $3-million loss in mental health
services for the poor.</TE>
<TE>   Up to 10 county employees may be laid off, but so far only two
have received notices, county officials said. About 140 vacant
positions have been eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   Just four departments, all involved in public safety, will see
their budgets increase this year--the Sheriff's Department, district
attorney's office, probation department and public defender's office.
Supervisors approved a 2.1% increase for those departments while
other agencies will see an average 4.2% decrease.</TE>
<TE>   A majority of supervisors, however, agreed to consider cutbacks
for the public safety departments later this year if the state cuts
are especially onerous. Supervisors John Flynn and Kathy Long agreed
with the proposal by Supervisor Steve Bennett, saying it makes good
fiscal sense.</TE>
<TE>   Although the public safety departments receive protected funding
under a local ordinance, Bennett contends that they received more
money in the current fiscal year than they were entitled to. Under
his resolution, the four agencies may be required to return that
overpayment, estimated at $4.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to identify all the areas where we have potential
flexibility and it's appropriate to do that at this time," Bennett
said.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Judy Mikels voted against the proposal, saying it would
set a precedent of taking away money that has already been budgeted
and spent.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't go back a year later and say, 'Whoops--we shouldn't
have given you that money,' " Mikels said.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Frank Schillo, a law enforcement ally, was absent.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff Bob Brooks told supervisors that Ventura County residents
have made clear that public safety is their top priority. Reducing
public safety budgets will send the wrong message, the sheriff said
after the vote.</TE>
<TE>   "We've already made our department as lean as we can," Brooks
said. "So this would mean serious service reductions."</TE>
<TE>   Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury said his office would analyze the
board's action to determine whether it violates the intent of the
local law that protects public safety dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Bradbury also questioned whether the board acted too hastily in
approving the resolution. Bennett unveiled his proposal for the first
time Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "It is always unwise to do this knee-jerk reaction to some
proposal that is not even very well thought out," Bradbury said. "The
board needs to keep in mind that they represent the people and they
are supposed to reflect the people's will. And you would think they
would at least want to ask the people about this."</TE>
<TE>   The proposed use of tobacco settlement funds to cover revenue
shortfalls also encountered opposition. Representatives of two
citizen advisory committees urged supervisors to dip into the $10.3
million available in 2002-03 only as a last resort.</TE>
<TE>   Both committees recommended that supervisors use the tobacco money
to continue health-care programs the county created last year. They
range from dental clinics for poor youths to payments for private
hospitals that provide care for the uninsured.</TE>
<TE>   "I urge you not to eat your seed corn," said Steven Arvizu,
chairman of a financial oversight committee for the tobacco dollars,
"and not to see [this money] as a panacea to solve county budget
problems."</TE>
<TE>   But supervisors unanimously agreed that they may have no choice
but to dip into the funds. The board agreed to put off any further
funding decisions until the state passes its own budget, possibly by
the end of summer.</TE>

<HD>No Terrorists Here, Say Merchants on Catalina</HD>
<DH>Security: Though FBI says report on Al Qaeda plot is
unsubstantiated, business owners fear tourists will stay away.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The classified report could not have been scarier: A merchant ship
with 40 Al Qaeda terrorists hidden aboard was believed steaming
toward Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Their plan: Unload near Santa Catalina Island in late May and then
strike downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The report was not made public until Tuesday, when the FBI in Los
Angeles confirmed that it had investigated the report, even boarding
incoming merchant vessels in search of terrorists.</LD>
<TE>   After several weeks of searching, "Nothing so far has
substantiated the intelligence information we received," said FBI
spokeswoman Cheryl Mimura.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Catalina Island officials and merchants were
struggling to reduce the impact of the intelligence tip--originally
reported in the Washington Times--on tourism at the start of the
critical summer season.</TE>
<TE>   The Catalina Island Chamber of Commerce quickly distributed a
carefully worded "mission statement."</TE>
<TE>   "Based on the information currently available from law-enforcement
and intelligence sources," the statement said, "it is believed that
there is no immediate danger to Catalina Island visitors or
residents."</TE>
<TE>   Chamber President Wayne Griffin was also reminding anyone who
would listen that the report indicated the alleged plan was to unload
terrorists "near Catalina Island. That doesn't necessarily mean on
the island. They could have just as easily have said near Long
Beach."</TE>
<TE>   But they didn't.</TE>
<TE>   "Tuesday morning's television sound bites didn't mention any of
that," Griffin said. "They made it sound like Al Qaeda had already
landed here."</TE>
<TE>   Within minutes of one TV report, Catalina Express, which ferries
about 20,000 people each week to and from the island, received four
cancellations.</TE>
<TE>   "This is exactly what terrorists hope for," Griffin said. "They
put these threats out there--real or not--just to get people all
stirred up."</TE>
<TE>   One such person didn't wait long to phone Jim Pike, owner of the
Trader Winds, an Internet cafe and gift store in Avalon. "I had a
lady call me at 7 in the morning," he said. "She wanted to know,
'What's this about a ship wanting to land on Catalina with Al Qaeda
on board?' "</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a precautionary warning," Pike told her. "Nobody's
landing." But then Pike offered the caller a sobering thought: "On
the other hand, something could happen and we need to be vigilant."</TE>
<TE>   Good point. It was one of many points--both good and
fanciful--being tossed around Tuesday by locals and visitors in
Catalina's cafes, T-shirt shops and glass-bottomed boats. Some urged
caution, others calm--all aware that it was impossible to know the
truth.</TE>
<TE>   While emphasizing that they had not discounted the report, federal
authorities said it did not rise to the level of credibility that
justified a public warning. It was more akin, they said, to the
purported threat last November against California bridges than the
terrorism threatened against Hollywood studios.</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood threat led the FBI last fall to issue a public
alert, while the warning about a possible attack against bridges was
made public by Gov. Gray Davis and resulted in some public criticism
of his decision.</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence experts have long been sensitive to issuing public
alerts about internal terrorism investigations, fearing they can
serve the terrorists' goal of spreading fear. If Al Qaeda did hope to
spread fear with a Catalina rumor, to some degree it succeeded.</TE>
<TE>   Elana Webb, manager of Catalina Shirt and Shade, said an Avalon
resident made a point of stopping her in the street.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was light-hearted news he wanted to share with me,"
Webb said. "Then he asked, 'Did you hear about terrorists that are
going to be landing within the next few days?' "</TE>
<TE>   She didn't quite believe him. "Great," she replied. "Just great."</TE>
<TE>   Vicki Hubert, front-desk clerk at the 73-room Pavilion Lodge, also
took the report in stride. "Everyone's talking about it, but I think
it will all die down in a few days," she said. "Besides, we're full
tonight and tomorrow night."</TE>
<TE>   Catalina merchants hope business stays that way. The island's
population of 5,000 swells to 20,000 on weekends. For merchants, July
would normally be the busiest time of year. Will the report on Al
Qaeda change that? For some folks, it won't.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell them that the report was based on information received
quite awhile ago, and that it was not found to have credibility,"
said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. Gary Olson of callers to the
sheriff's substation in Avalon. "They're relieved to know things are
still fine in paradise."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday at least, other Avalon residents were less sure.</TE>
<TE>   Joan Tiihonen, banquet and beverage manager at Antonio's Pizzeria,
said she heard about the report all day--at the post office, in the
street, at work. People were worried.</TE>
<TE>   "Avalon is one mile square," she said. "It has a few sheriff's
deputies who tool around in golf carts. There's only one fire
engine.''</TE>
<TE>   The result: Tiihonen and her staff stationed themselves in her
office overlooking Avalon Bay, surveying incoming pleasure boats with
binoculars.</TE>
<TE>   "We're taking this seriously," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Coast Guard was inundated with calls from wary citizens
reporting sightings of "large ships operating in the vicinity of
Catalina Island," said Coast Guard Lt. Steve LaLonde.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been telling folks not to worry," he said, "because
freighters headed for the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach have to
swing past Catalina to get there."</TE>
<TE>   What's more, since Sept. 11, federal officials have established a
500-yard security zone around all Navy ships. The U.S. Customs
Service remains on "code red alert" status. Multi-agency teams led by
the Coast Guard have been boarding all incoming freighters and cruise
lines, and patrolling the waterfront around the clock.</TE>
<TE>   It is all part of what port authorities call the "new normal
routine" at the adjacent ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, where
about 5,000 vessels from around the world dock each year.</TE>
<TE>   Yet another theme surfaced on Catalina on Tuesday--the possibility
that the rumor didn't come from Al Qaeda. What if the U.S.
government, locals asked, spread the rumor? What if Catalina were
caught in some giant espionage campaign?</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're entering an era of disinformation," said a shop
clerk. "It's hard to tell what's true. If I were an FBI agent, I'd
let them think I think they're in Southern California, knowing all
the while they're someplace else, like Canada."</TE>

<HD>Stricter Truancy Measures Urged</HD>
<DH>Schools: Grand jury wants habitual offenders to be placed
in juvenile hall. Critics say that approach would be costly and
ineffective.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County students who continually ditch class should be
incarcerated and those at risk of becoming habitual truants should be
put in a "boot-camp" style program to get them back on track,
according to a grand jury report.</LD>
<LD>   Citing U.S. Department of Justice statistics that show skipping
school can lead to more serious offenses, the report released Tuesday
recommends Ventura County school districts and police agencies do
more to curb truancy and crack down on offenders, including sending
some to juvenile hall.</LD>
<LD>   But some probation and school officials disagreed with that
approach, saying it would be costly and ineffective.</LD>
<TE>   "Locking kids up for truancy is not good public policy," said Cal
Remington, a county probation officer. "I can see where it might
sound like a simple solution ... but for those kids with serious
social and family problems, it isn't the way to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Because a 1976 state law requires truants in juvenile hall be
separated from youngsters guilty of more serious offenses such as
burglary, theft or assault, county judges do not incarcerate teens
who habitually ditch class, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   But this practice, the grand jury report stated, should change
when the county's Juvenile Justice Center opens next year, providing
plenty of room to house truants separately.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Remington said the $100 per day it would take to house and
feed one truant in the new facility would be better spent on
after-school tutoring programs for at-risk youth.</TE>
<TE>   The report--which contains only suggestions--also calls for
allocating more money for existing truancy prevention programs in the
county, providing parenting classes and counseling at schools and
stressing to elementary school students the importance of school
attendance at that level. It found that a program modeled after a Los
Angeles County boot camp for troubled teens--called Vital
Intervention and Directional Alternatives--is needed locally.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Supt. Of Schools Charles Weis said he agrees with
most of the report's recommendations, but does not believe
incarceration is the solution for all truants.</TE>
<TE>   "For many kids, it just teaches them how to be a criminal," he
said. "The key is to diagnose the issues for each kid and come up
with ways to treat those individually."</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard police Sgt. T. W. Lumas, however, said there should be a
way to punish kids who commit lower-level offenses to deter them from
getting involved in crime. The panel cited a report that found 95% of
youngsters who are serious juvenile offenders began as truants.</TE>
<TE>   "They need to be held accountable for their actions," Lumas said.
"If there was a place for them to go, word would get out and maybe
more of them would go to school."</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury also found that the county lacks an effective way
of tracking truants. Educators estimate that about 5% of students are
absent from school each day, but it's unknown how many are actually
skipping school. Because annual state education allocations are based
on a district's average daily attendance, truancy could potentially
cost local schools up to $40 million each year, Weis said.</TE>
<TE>   In response to the panel's recommendations, Weis said he has asked
the Ventura County School Attendance Review Board to create a
standard way of collecting data on absences that could be used by all
20 local school districts.</TE>
<TE>   Other school officials said they already comply with most of the
panel's recommendations. In the Oxnard Elementary School District,
classes are offered on each campus for parents in subjects ranging
from improving their English skills to a course on positive parenting
strategies.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel pretty good about everything we're doing," Oxnard Supt.
Richard Duarte said. "Some of it is out of our local control, and
unfortunately a lot of it boils down to resources."</TE>

<HD>Higher Valley Breakup Fee Is Estimated</HD>
<DH>Secession: L.A. needs $288 million a year from the Valley
if the two split, city-sponsored report says. The official figure
used to put measure on ballot was $128 million.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>To avoid raising taxes or cutting services, the city of Los Angeles
would need $288 million a year from the San Fernando Valley if it
became a city, according to a new report commissioned by Los Angeles
government officials.</LD>
<LD>   That estimate is sharply higher than the one adopted by the state
agency that cleared secession for the November ballot.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles City Council members voted 13-1 on Tuesday to send the
study to the Local Agency Formation Commission, the agency that put
Valley secession on the November ballot. That agency found that the
estimated payment from the Valley to the city would be $128 million a
year.</LD>
<TE>   The size of the payment in part reflects the Valley's financial
health and the differing estimates do not affect the ballot measure,
which already has been approved by LAFCO. But the debate over how
much money would be needed to compensate the city for the loss of the
Valley continues, as city officials who oppose secession maintain
that it would hurt the city that is left behind.</TE>
<TE>   As secession supporters and critics debated the latest estimate, a
city commissioner announced that he was quitting his post on the Los
Angeles Ethics Commission to join the secession campaign. The city
attorney's office has held that ethics panel members may not campaign
for secession or contribute to it financially.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel I must now fully engage in the campaign for Valley
cityhood," David Fleming said at a news conference at the Sportsmen's
Lodge in Studio City. "I cannot, nor will I, sit on the sidelines at
this critical juncture in the history of the Valley and, indeed, all
of Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Before Fleming, a lawyer, served on the commission, he said he
contributed "well north of" $100,000 for a state study that
determined Valley secession is feasible. Fleming said he plans to
donate money toward secession, help with fund-raising efforts and
participate in the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The 46-year Valley resident, whose move was welcomed by secession
backers, said he supports the breakup because he believes that a
smaller government provides residents with better public services and
more local control.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the city's latest estimates regarding the financial
implications of the breakup, Fleming said he was not concerned
because the state study of the breakup is complete, so the new
analysis will not affect the ballot measure that voters will consider
on Nov. 5. They also will vote on a proposed Hollywood secession the
same day.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Brain, president of Valley VOTE, the group spearheading
secession, dismissed the council vote as a ploy to create doubt among
voters. "The city is playing with numbers," he said. "[Council
members] are trying to protect their empire and bureaucracy at all
costs."</TE>
<TE>   "As we look at the possibility of amputation in November, I think
it's important to have more than rough estimates," said Councilman
Eric Garcetti. "This shows us that the [proposed payment] is nowhere
near what it ought to be."</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Wendy Greuel added: "We need to have individuals make
educated choices about what will happen if secession passes or
doesn't pass."</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO Executive Director Larry Calemine, whose agency produced the
lower estimate, declined to comment, saying that neither he nor his
consultants have had time to review the documents.</TE>
<TE>   The new analysis was conducted by Hamilton, Rabinovitz &amp; Alschuler
Inc. for $92,000 on behalf of the city.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to educational purposes, the document could be used to
show that the city exhausted its administrative appeals if it were to
sue the agency.</TE>
<TE>   The annual payments from a new city to the city that it left are
necessary to meet state requirements that incorporation or secession
efforts are "revenue neutral," or don't cause harm to either body. In
Los Angeles' case, everyone agrees that there must be a large payment
from any new Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   However, the number of city employees that can be cut--and
therefore the exact alimony figure--remains up for debate.</TE>
<TE>   Edward K. Hamilton, chairman of the consulting group, said that
LAFCO took a "meat cleaver approach" and simply lopped 27.5% out of
all city agencies to reach its figure.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a job for a scalpel," Hamilton said, noting that he and
his group looked at all of the city's 43 agencies--position by
position--to see how many jobs could be cut without affecting city
services.</TE>
<TE>   They decided that 7,515 positions could be cut--nearly 1,700 fewer
than LAFCO's figure. Those positions led to the extra $160 million in
annual payments.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton also said that those payments should continue, not shrink
to zero in 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no reason to decrease it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Nate Holden was the lone member who voted against
sending the report to LAFCO, saying that the city ought to allow the
voters to decide the matter in November.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski said the new documents will help
voters make an educated decision.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not saying, don't put anything on the ballot," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is saying ... safeguard the citizens, voters, taxpayers in
both areas, in all areas," she said. "Make sure the new city is
fiscally viable and the remaining city is not harmed."</TE>

<HD>Willie Davenport, 59; Olympic Champion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ORTEGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Willie Davenport, the 1968 Olympic champion in the men's 110-meter
high hurdles and one of the first African American athletes to
represent the United States in the Winter Olympics, has died. He was
59.</LD>
<LD>   Davenport was changing planes at O'Hare International Airport in
Chicago on Monday when he collapsed, apparently from a heart attack.
He was pronounced dead at Resurrection Medical Center, a hospital
spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   Davenport equaled the then-Olympic record of 13.33 seconds in
winning the high hurdles in the 1968 Games in Mexico City. In the
same event, he placed fourth at Munich in the 1972 Games and third at
Montreal in 1976, when he was 33. He was a surprise winner of the
1964 Olympic trials in the high hurdles, but was eliminated in a
semifinal heat of the Games in Tokyo while battling a leg injury.</LD>
<TE>   Davenport, who later served on the U.S. Olympic Committee, was
frustrated by his first Olympic experience, but he beat U.S. teammate
Erv Hall for the gold medal in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   Although he was so nervous before the start of the race that he
almost fell while taking off his sweat pants, he said he knew he was
going to win when the starter's pistol was fired.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I had won the race," he said. "It was perhaps the only
race I ever ran that way, but that first step was so perfect, right
on the money. I coasted over the last three hurdles thinking, 'It's
over, it's over.' "</TE>
<TE>   John Smith, a renowned sprint coach and a teammate of Davenport's
on the 1972 Olympic team, said that 1960 Olympic long jump champion
Ralph Boston gave Davenport the nickname "Breeze" because of the
grace with which he cleared the 42-inch-high hurdles.</TE>
<TE>   "He would just flow over them like the wind," Smith said. "He was
just that efficient as a hurdler."</TE>
<TE>   Smith, the top-ranked 400-meter runner in the world while at UCLA
in 1971, met Davenport in 1968 shortly after graduating from Fremont
High in Los Angeles. The two became friends a couple of years later
and roomed together several times while representing the United
States in international meets.</TE>
<TE>   "He always had a smile on his face," said Smith, who coaches
Olympic 100 champion Maurice Greene, among others, for the highly
regarded HSI club based in Irvine. "He had a country air about him.
He never got too caught up in his accomplishments."</TE>
<TE>   Davenport, who was born in Troy, Ala., and attended Southern
University in Baton Rouge, La., gained prominence in 1976 when he won
a bronze medal in the high hurdles at 33, when most sprint and hurdle
athletes have long since retired.</TE>
<TE>   But his greatest athletic acclaim, at least in the eyes of the
national media, might have come in 1980, when he and Jeff Gadley
became the first African American athletes to represent the United
States in the Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Davenport and Gadley, who also had a track and field background in
the decathlon, were members of the U.S. four-man bobsled team that
finished 12th. Along with Bob Wilson, a Canadian bobsledder, they
were the first blacks to compete in the Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very proud," Davenport said during the Games in Lake Placid.
"Words can't explain how I feel. Webster doesn't have a word for it.
'Good' doesn't do it. Neither does 'great.'</TE>
<TE>   "There was a myth that blacks couldn't make the Winter Olympics.
That inspired me. I think it's important that black Americans get
involved in everything our country has to offer. Go to any black
neighborhood and you see homemade basketball courts and homemade
baseball diamonds. If black kids grow up skating, they will be in the
winter Olympics. It just needs exposure."</TE>
<TE>   Later, Davenport said he loved the actual bobsled competition but
didn't like the cold and snow.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wasn't used to competing in conditions like that," he
said. "But I highly recommend bobsledding for fun."</TE>
<TE>   The medical center spokesman said Davenport was a lieutenant
colonel in the National Guard. He apparently was on National Guard
business in Boise, Idaho, and, according to his wife, Marian, was
traveling to his office in Falls Church, Va., when he collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Davenport was inducted into the USA Track and Field Hall of Fame
in 1982 and into the Olympic Hall of Fame in 1990. After retiring
from track, he entered the National Guard.</TE>
<TE>   Davenport, who lived in Baton Rouge, is survived by his wife and
their son, Mark.</TE>
<TE>   Military funeral arrangements are pending.</TE>

<CX>   Davenport obituary--The obituary of Olympic gold medalist Willie
Davenport in Wednesday's California section incorrectly reported that
he lived in Baton Rouge, La. He lived in Falls Church, Va. Identified
as a lieutenant colonel in the National Guard, he was actually a
colonel in the Army National Guard. Also, he is survived by three
children, not one as stated in the obituary. They are Willie
Davenport Stewart Jr. of Youngstown, Ohio; Tonya Davenport Morris of
Monroe, La.; and Mark Davenport of Baton Rouge. Marian Davenport,
identified in the obituary as his wife, is actually his ex-wife.</CX>

<HD>City Nixes Massage Proposal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA BORGATTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Massage patrons in Lake Forest won't have to worry about anyone
peering through windows while their aching muscles are getting
therapy.</LD>
<LD>   The City Council voted Tuesday not to pursue new rules that would
have required 6-inch windows in all massage room doors and signs
advising clients that their activities might be monitored by police.</LD>
<LD>   "I at first thought there were a couple of good reasons to have
windows and signs," Mayor Richard T. Dixon said. But he and other
council members changed their minds after hearing from 15 massage
therapists who said such rules would be unreasonable and insulting to
them and their clients.</LD>
<TE>   "A lot of my clients are law-enforcement officials, and I think
they'd be a little embarrassed to walk in and see a sign like that,"
said massage therapist Danielle Frances, whose father is a sheriff's
deputy.</TE>
<TE>   Massage clients said such surveillance would be a blatant invasion
of privacy. Masseuses objected that the proposed rules would punish
all businesses for the transgressions of a few. Others criticized the
city for not collaborating with industry professionals while drafting
the new rules.</TE>
<TE>   City officials thought that illegal behavior such as prostitution
would be less likely if the rooms could be monitored. Authorities
have made several prostitution arrests in recent years.</TE>

<HD>Attorney Sentenced to Prison for Fraud</HD>
<DH>Court: Beverly Hills lawyer with a history of questionable
insurance claims also must pay $2.8 million restitution in the
sinking of yacht.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Beverly Hills attorney who scuttled his luxurious 76-foot motor
yacht off the Italian coast to collect on a fraudulently inflated
insurance policy was sentenced Tuesday to 7 1/2 years in federal
prison.</LD>
<LD>   Rex K. DeGeorge, 66, also was ordered to pay $2.8 million
restitution to Cigna Property and Casualty Co., which insured the
vessel.</LD>
<LD>   DeGeorge, dressed in a drab olive prison jacket, sounded contrite
as he addressed U.S. District Judge Lourdes Baird before his
sentencing.</LD>
<TE>   During the trial, evidence showed that DeGeorge had earlier
claimed and collected insurance from three companies on the
mysterious losses of three other yachts.</TE>
<TE>   "Somehow, your words don't have the ring of truth to me," the
judge told DeGeorge. She described his conduct as arrogant and
brazen.</TE>
<TE>   Convicted in March on 16 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, wire
fraud and perjury, DeGeorge faced a term of 6 1/2 to eight years in
prison under federal sentencing guidelines. Baird said she decided on
a 7 1/2-year sentence because of his age and because he suffers from
a mild heart condition.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney David Dudley said his client intends to appeal
the conviction.</TE>
<TE>   DeGeorge has a history of filing questionable insurance claims
dating back three decades.</TE>
<TE>   According to civil court records not introduced at his trial, he
filed 32 claims with various insurance carriers from 1976 to 1990,
including three for the other yachts that disappeared or sank under
mysterious circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   The criminal case against him, developed by investigators from the
U.S. Postal Service, stemmed from his purchase in 1992 of the
Principe Di Pictor for $1.9 million from an Italian shipbuilder.</TE>
<TE>   Before taking out insurance on the vessel, the jury found,
DeGeorge orchestrated a series of sham financial transactions that
inflated the yacht's paper value to $3.6 million and concealed his
ownership.</TE>
<TE>   Neil Lerner, a Los Angeles maritime attorney hired by Cigna,
investigated the claim and unraveled the scheme.</TE>
<TE>   The insurance company refused to pay and persuaded U.S. District
Judge J. Spencer Letts to rescind the policy because DeGeorge had
concealed his lengthy record of insurance claims. The judge also
ordered DeGeorge to pay Cigna's legal costs, which exceeded $2.8
million.</TE>
<TE>   Letts was so outraged by what he heard during the civil trial that
he referred the matter to the U.S. attorney's office for criminal
investigation. As a result, DeGeorge and two associates were indicted
by a federal grand jury in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Paul A. Ebeling, 62, of St. Louis, and Gabriel Falco, 36, of
Amagansett, N.Y., pleaded guilty and testified against DeGeorge.
Ebeling was sentenced earlier this week to 18 months already served
in custody. Falco received probation.</TE>
<TE>   The two men testified that they and DeGeorge used electric drills
and saws to cut holes in the Principe's fiberglass hull throughout
the night of Nov. 7, 1992, in waters about 50 nautical miles from
Naples.</TE>
<TE>   But the sturdy vessel refused to sink. At sunrise, an Italian
coast guard cutter spotted the partially submerged yacht and sped to
the rescue.</TE>
<TE>   Panicked, DeGeorge hastily contrived a story about piracy on the
high seas. He told the Italians that he had hired a Russian sea
captain named Andrea Libovich and two Russian sailors to ferry the
yacht on its maiden voyage from Naples to Greece.</TE>
<TE>   Once in international waters, DeGeorge said, the Russians flashed
guns and locked the Americans in a cabin below deck. DeGeorge
theorized that the Russians wanted the yacht to run drugs into Italy.
But when they realized that the Principe was not very fast, he said,
they apparently decided to scuttle the vessel. He said the Russians
escaped in a black speedboat just before the Italian cutter arrived.</TE>
<TE>   From the outset, the Italians were dubious about the story. The
Americans couldn't explain why they did not call for help on the
Principe's radio after the Russians fled. They also did not seem
happy to be rescued.</TE>
<TE>   After towing the Principe back to shore, the Italians placed
DeGeorge, Ebeling and Falco under house arrest while they
investigated.</TE>
<TE>   Although they could find no trace of Libovich, no charges were
filed and authorities allowed the three to leave after two months.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, Baird allowed Assistant U.S. Attys. Eileen
Decker and William Bottger to mention DeGeorge's previous yacht
sinkings. However, she barred them from presenting details of those
incidents because it might prejudice the jurors.</TE>
<TE>   In 1970, DeGeorge claimed that he and a companion were drugged
while on an overnight cruise off the Southern California coast by a
couple of Peruvian coffee merchants who had expressed an interest in
buying his 43-foot yacht. When they came to, he and his acquaintance
fled in the yacht's dinghy, he said.</TE>
<TE>   It took five days before he reported the episode to police. No
trace was ever found of the yacht or the Peruvians. DeGeorge received
a $43,000 settlement from Hartford Insurance Co.</TE>
<TE>   In 1976, DeGeorge bought a 57-foot racing yacht and went sailing
with Ebeling off the coast of Italy. On a starless, moonless night,
he said, the vessel hit "a low-profile dark object that was not
visible."</TE>
<TE>   DeGeorge said he and Ebeling escaped in a dinghy before the yacht
sank. Lloyds of London at first refused to pay on his $194,000 claim,
but relented after he threatened to sue.</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, DeGeorge collected $245,000 insurance after claiming that
his 47-foot yacht was blown up during a failed assassination attempt
off the Southern California coast.</TE>
<TE>   He told Fireman's Fund that the attempt on his life grew out of
his representation of a client in an acrimonious business dispute.</TE>

<HD>Castillo's Streak Is at 32</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Seeking to extend his 31-game hitting streak in the third inning,
Luis Castillo was given the take sign on a 3-and-0 count, which left
him hoping the pitch would be a strike.</LD>
<LD>   ''I didn't want to walk,'' Castillo said. ''I needed a hit. I
wanted to tell the umpire, 'If it's close, please call it a
strike.'''</LD>
<LD>   Chuck Finley did throw a strike, and Castillo pulled the next
pitch for a double to make it 32 games in a row--the longest hitting
streak in the major leagues in 15 years.</LD>
<TE>   He scored the first run and had two more hits to finish three for
four and help Florida defeat Cleveland, 4-0, Tuesday night in the
first meeting between the teams since the 1997 World Series.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Dempster (5-6) gave up four hits in 61/3 innings before being
ejected after he hit a batter for the second time. Manager Jeff
Torborg also was thrown out.</TE>
<TE>   Derrek Lee hit a two-run homer, his 15th.</TE>
<TE>   But Castillo drew the biggest cheers from the crowd of 9,724. He
was retired on a bunt attempt leading off the first, then doubled
when he chopped the ball into the infield grass and it bounded over
third baseman Travis Fryman's head on one hop.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo scored on Eric Owens' two-out single to make it 1-0. He
hit another double off the third-base bag in the fifth, singled in
the seventh and raised his average to .336.</TE>
<TE>   The speedy second baseman is the 18th player to hit in at least 32
games in a row, and only the fourth since 1949. His streak is the
longest since Benito Santiago hit in 34 consecutive games in 1987.
Paul Molitor had a 39-game streak earlier that season.</TE>

<LD>Sitcom showdown--A story in Tuesday's Calendar about the coming
showdown between ABC's "My Wife and Kids" and Fox's "The Bernie Mac
Show" mistakenly identified Fox's executive vice president of
strategic program planning by the wrong last name. His name is
Preston Beckman. In addition, the story failed to note that, with
Regency Television, "The Bernie Mac Show" is also produced by 20th
Century Fox Television. Additionally, the story should have said it
is the show's respective studios, not networks, that are heavily
promoting them for Emmy Award consideration.</LD>
